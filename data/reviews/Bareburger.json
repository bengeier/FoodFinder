{"text":"Decided to come into Bareburger and give it a try as it just opened not too long ago. This is the first location of Bareburger outside of the US and is situated in a prime location as it's very near the Eaton Center. There is a good selection of different burgers with various kinds of patty (beef, bison, elk, wild board, duck, turkey, and vegan options). You can also customize and build a burger to your liking too! I also liked that Bareburger has Sir Kensington ketchup. This is not your ordinary ketchup at all. It's way more delicious and is the best ketchup I've had so far. Overall, 4/5.

AMBIENCE [5/5]
Great design for a burger joint. The decor had a rustic feel to it and definitely was very fitting for a burger joint. The music that was playing in the background matched the setting and was at the right volume. The restaurant really has a nice and relaxing feel to it. Interestingly, both TV's in the restaurant was on the Teletoon channel.

SERVICE [5/5]
Service was very good as the waiters and waitresses were very attentive and friendly. The waiter for my table also gave an introduction on how the menu works and highlighted important information.

FOOD [3/5]

The Standard Burger - $11.25
This burger was fairly good. One of the better ones that I had in Toronto. The meat was flavourful and tender. I personally would have liked it to be a bit more juicy. This burger had the right amount of toppings and sauce such that it did not over power the flavour of the meat. Overall pretty good but fairly expensive for just a burger. Note that all the red meats are cooked medium well, so if you want it differently you need to ask.

Sweet Fries (Sides) - $4.85
These were good and was a good quantity for a side dish. They tasted just like sweet potatoes and were very fresh. However, my order didn't come with the two dipping sauces: special sauce and buttermilk ranch. It seems like these two sauces only come with the order from the \"Shares\" section and not the \"Sides\" section."}
{"text":"The food might be organic (and it's really, really tasty) but they really have to do something about the smell of the new furniture/finishes. It's bad - incredibly bad. I had to wait about 10 minutes for a table last week and decided to wait outside, in the freezing cold, rather than continue to breathe in whatever it was. It's off-gassing something terrible.

Otherwise, I had the elk burger and it was delicious. The fries were OK, the onion rings were pretty good, and the fried chicken was quite tasty. But there's no way I'm going back until all of the off-gassing is done."}
{"text":"been back TWICE since i had the fried chicken sandwich and believe it or not both times i came back a manager/supervisor came over and told me they \"ran out of buttermilk chicken\" 

once i can understand twice your just incompetent.

service was absolutely horrible

you lost a customer"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 stars review. 

Went to have hot honey chicken sandwich & side of onion rings & hot honey milkshake. 

Chicken was tender enough and pretty well seasoned, but could use less batter. Hot honey at the bottom of sprout bread was interesting. 

As to onion rings, I guess their cooking oil was there for a while. Doesn't taste too fresh to me. Some of the rings have harden shells when you bite it.  

Milkshake....I have had better elsewhere. 

I would say this is a place to try not-so-boring sandwiches once in a while, but I wouldn't visit regularly. 

Portion was just regular. Service was ok."}
{"text":"Love the onion rings here. It comes with multiple dipping sauces."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a burger on a Friday night so after looking at a few places a decided on this one, and I am so happy I made this choice. 

I was feeling adventurous so I decided I'd get an Elk burger. After my first bite I knew I was hooked, this would be my burger place from now on in the downtown core. I recommend this joint if you're looking for an organic and fresh burger. 

The French fries were equally as awesome, and that secret sauce is wonderful. I haven't enjoyed burgers and fries this much since going to Fresh burger!"}
{"text":"More of a 3.5/5.

Visited Bareburger September 21st with 2 others. I've passed by this place very often as I live in the area, and I thought their decor looked very interesting. After seeing their ratings on Yelp, I was looking forward to trying it out. As a former vegan/vegetarian, and someone who tries to buy organic as much as possible, this place really embodied that wholesome-organic-grassfed vibe.

Beverages: Being lactose-intolerant, I was psyched to get a milkshake - something I've never had - as they offer mikshakes with coconut ice-cream and rice milk. The chocolate-banana milkshake was good, thick, and creamy, everything you'd want in a milkshake, at least I assume. My acquaintances both got the (regular) choc-peanut butter option, which was apparently very good as well.

Food: We all got the build-a-burger option. I got the quinoa patty on a sprout bun,with my choice of toppings, and the patty was probably one of the better quinoa patties I've had. The size of the burger is decent, probably around the same size as a The Works burger. Unlike most burger joints, sides aren't included here as a meal. The 3 of us shared a side of fries, which were fine and nothing to rave about.

Service: This place would get 4 or 5 stars if not for the service. Our server was pretty rude even though we were nothing but pleasant guests. She slammed my milkshake down on the table. When the burgers arrived, I had my hands on the table. Instead of most servers who sort of announce the food before placing it down, she kind of just semi-shoved my hands out of the way to make room for the tray. It also took forever for us to get her attention and get our bills once we were done eating.

*Also, for those with celiac or serious gluten allergies: although a lot of the items on the menu are labelled gluten-free, they do state that they don't have strict contamination control when it comes to handling gluten & gluten-free items."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Small portions and overpriced. FYI - I smelt like I just came out of a deep fryer when I left the place, horrible ventilation. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way for this."}
{"text":"Came in for a Sunday Brunch in a party of 8 expecting fresh, good food. Average rating from everyone on the table was a 2/5. Wild and Wilted tasted very off, they forgot wedges (and then gave us 4 wedges when we reminded them), large milkshake was not 2 glasses but rather a glass n half... the list goes on. Wouldn't recommend this l
Place- atleast for brunch."}
{"text":"Recently every time I go, the service is really slow. Even when its not that crowded, not sure why. 

Also it is kind of disappointing to only get the burger with no sides (you have to pay extra to get any kind of side).

But the food is still consistently good. Their guacamole is unusually spicy which isn't great, so I don't recommend that but they have amazing burger - both vegan and their meat options are very good (according to my meat-eating companions) 

Very casual atmosphere, usually has kid's shows playing on the big tvs."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was friendly. I had the SoCal turkey burger which was fine, but the Tab-bowl-leh was really quit good and could serve as the main dish."}
{"text":"Great variety of burgers, ranging from everyday to more uncommon meats, as well as multiple vegetarian options. You could also build your own burger from a long lists of buns, meats, cheeses and more. There were also great side options. The fries we ordered came with 4 different sauces - all of which were unique and delicious in their own way. We were 5 to order burgers (I went with one of the vegetarian options), and we were all very happy with our choices. Service was friendly, although not the fastest. 

I'll definitely come back when I can and try out another burger."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday around 5pm with a party of 3 and we were seated immediately. We started with the Fries and Onion Rings and the 101 Year Old Pickles which were both great. I ordered the Supreme burger which lives up to its name. A toppling beef burger topped with leaf lettuce, french fries, cheese, applewood bacon, and onion rings. I had it with a pint of the Conductors IPA which was alright. They had the Tigers baseball game on when we walked in but for some reason changed it to Teletoon retro for the 20 something year old hipsters sitting at the bar... Aside from the odd choice of tv station, everything was great. Would recommend to anyone trying to find a new burger joint downtown, especially for vegetarians."}
{"text":"they changed the manual and took off  the good stuff. taste is much worse . doesn't worth the price"}
{"text":"Found this place on a recent trip to Toronto and was pleased to hear they'll be in Florida soon! Excellent waiter helped me create the perfect veggie burger and it did not disappoint. The sweet potato fries were fantastic. Only wish we were closer!"}
{"text":"This is what fast casual places should be about. Decent amount of menu selection. Pretty good prices. Excellent service. Nice decor. And oh yea, good food.

Did takeout from here on a whim and was not disappointed. I ordered at the restaurant (phone was not working for them) and the staff there were helpful in making recommendations. In the end, we got a buffalo chicken sandwich and a Sunny Day salad.

Buffalo chicken was crisp, not oily despite being newly fried and had a pretty tasty buffalo sauce on it. Bun seemed fresh and it was a decently sized portion. My wife's salad was neatly put together and consisted of all seemingly very fresh foods. Going in she was a little unsure how the hummus on the salad would be but that ended up being the standout to her. 

I also want to point out the staff. Not only did they patiently help us but while waiting for the food, I saw them interact with all the customers with a smile on their face and they genuinely seemed to enjoy being there that night.

Seems there is one of these chains two towns over from me at home, I will be heading there at some point based on my experience here."}
{"text":"The burger acoutrements were excellent, I had the Grindhouse, the bun and spicy slaw were excellent but my burger was so overcooked it was pretty bad. Because of that the elk had no flavour and it really didn't allow the burger to come together.

My wife did order the standard, it was cooked slightly less (as not at the centre of the sung for an hour) but wasn't \"smashed\" so it was almost a little round burger in the middle of a bun, almost like a reverse donut hole.

The menu states they cook it to med well unless otherwise specified but clearly both of our, especially mine were way overdone.

On the bright side the sweet potato fries were amazingly delicious, we tried them with the \"Sir Kensington\" ketchup and that stuff is just plain bad! Tastes like vinegar and tomato sauce, i guess I'm just too used to Heinz. Service was good, it was busy for lunch on a Friday though and we waited about 15 minutes for a table with 2 ppl."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice in the span of a week, so I've tried at least a half a dozen items on the menu. My main complaint is that the place smells like a grease trap. It's especially bad in the winter when the smell seeps into your winter coat and you walk around smelling like grease for days. My second complaint is the pricing. It costs about $14 for a small salad before you even add protein, and it is really tiny. You can't get full even with the added protein. I don't mind spending more for quality, but this place has more cons than pros."}
{"text":"If you like being robbed head on over to Bare Burger.

For 15 dollars I expected at least an average size burger instead I received a huge bun with a small slider sized patty. The burger itself was not bad but service was on the slower side. Manager also constantly tried to up sell us to buy the most expensive burgers.

I would recommend this place if your the type of person who doesn't mind getting ripped off and has plenty of money."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for a while for this place to open up and it did not disappoint. The veggie options here are actually great. Try the farmstead that comes on a collard green wrap.

Also they are getting their alcohol setup with some local brews. Im gonna make my way through their menu and try everything i can."}
{"text":"I was torn between a 3 or 4 stars review because there isn't an option in between, but ultimately I decided to skew my overall score a little bit towards the actual food part.

The ambience and service are top-notch here; staff is super friendly and attentive, the decor and branding are superb - especially the attention to detail from menu design to ketchup/mustard bottles. Obviously a lot of work has been put towards the design and credit needs to given where it's due.

Now, the food. I have to start off by saying \"organic meat\" means nothing to me and there aren't bonus points for this - I care about how my burger taste, not where it came from or how it's grown. I had the Supreme burger and it was very, very dry. There's little to no sauce and patty feels like it's overcooked - or perhaps this is what organic beef taste like. Of course, the price of eating free range, hormone-free meat is also very steep. Each burger is about $11 - $13 and they do NOT come with a side, just the burger itself. However, the onion rings were great (this coming from an onion ring hater) and the difference dips for fries are a nice touch as well.

Overall, a full meal for two will run you for about $50 - $60, which I think is a little bit too much for a burger joint."}
{"text":"French will follow.

Excellent food, fresh, tasty !!! I took a buckardo Bareburger(beef, aged cheddar, brisket, wild mushurooms, smoke sauce, brioche bun) and french fries, WOW! Awesome ! 

The service and the decoration are also very sharpe !!!

Excellente nourriture, fraiche et gouteuse à souhait !!! J'ai pris un Buckardo Bareburger (boeuf, cheddar vieux, champignons sauvages, sauce fumée, pain brioché) et des frite, WOW, incroyable!!!

Le service et la déco sont aussi très bon !!!"}
{"text":"Wow. If you're a fan of unique meats and a purpose built burger, this place is for you. Unlike burger places where you build to your ideal burger, Bareburger is all about the signature burger. Great flavour combinations on the menu, and very tasty dipping sauces (for those who dip). And if you ask / request, they have a really cool secret menu that's been designed just for Toronto (maybe even a Canada only thing). 

Fast friendly service. Infinite ice tea (American style). Great add to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"A bit disappointing
The onion rings were good (the breading is flavoured with herbs), but the burger (I got Buckaroo) was mediocre.
The bun was too dense for my liking. The pattie was just so-so, didn't stand out as either really juicy or really flavourful. 
And I got really bad heartburn afterwards (not really their fault, but it wasn't good enough to justify the heartburn).
For $20, I would have expected a better gourmet burger. Wouldn't comeback as there are many burger places to try in Toronto"}
{"text":"The burgers are all well and good, but on Uber Eats this restaurant is always highlighted. Out of, quite literally, the last TEN times I've attempted to order from this Bareburger on Uber Eats they haven't accepted the order.

Ten times in a row.

Why bother listing on Uber Eats if you're not going to accept orders coming from there??!"}
{"text":"amazing food.. so many choices, it was late afternoon place was packed so service was little slow but overall good place to visit if you are in the city, will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and sides. Big and tasty local beers! Authentic decoriation. Maybe a but crowded. OK service. Definitely would come again!"}
{"text":"This place has so much hype, just like five-guys did and now that Japanese cheesecake shop. Once the hype dies down people will realize they are paying for an overpriced, well-branded burger.

 Everything was fine on the burger but that was the problem. I was expecting one of the best burgers of my life after reading about this place. I'm not paying $15 for them to not even salt my beef patty. Yes, they did not put the most basic mineral - SALT on their beef patty. I went here twice and both times my patty was not salted. Both times my burgers were overloaded with sauce to make up for that!

I was also disappointed with the extra pickles. I payed 4$ for 2 little sauce containers of sliced pickles - not worth.


The onion rings and fries were amazing! I don't know why they remembered to put salt on those maybe they were just following instructions? 

Overall a promising place that will definitely improve in the future."}
{"text":"Wow! I will start by saying that I don't eat red meat and I know that will disqualify me from being a reliable judge to some. With that said, if you eat poultry then this is the burger place to go. Their turkey burger is brilliant, but nothing compared to their duck burger. And if you want to try something truly indulgent then top a duck burger off with their duck bacon. 
I eat here twice a week and am gaining a ton of weight, but it's worth every delicious pound."}
{"text":"This review is based on my second visit here, which was yesterday around 9 PM. I ordered a beef burger (forgot the name) and a large side of onion rings to share with friends.

I used to rave about the onion rings to my friends, but maybe not after this visit. The panko crust was way too thick. It was too hard, too crunchy, and we all felt like our mouths were stuffed with crumbs. We never finished it off. 1/5.

The burger itself was just OK. It was really salty and nothing on the burger stood out to me. I can make a better burger at home. Also, the burger fell apart after I took one bite. The patty was crumbly and fell onto my dress... Luckily the toppings fell into my plate. I've tried many burger places and I've never had this happen to me. 1/5

The only redeeming factor about this place was the service. My server was absolutely fantastic! She always made sure our drinks were refilled. Split the bills accordingly. I would only come back because of her. 5/5

Overall, the location is great since it's down the street from Eaton and sometimes I don't want to make the trip up to Holy Chuck, but I will never come back here unless someone convinces me otherwise. My bill came up to around $23 for a burger, half of the onion rings, and an orange soda."}
{"text":"great restaurant great service you can pick one of the burgers and change the patty to your own likening and you can also make your own combination. on top of that it is organic.we shared the rings and fries plate. my only complain is that the smell of frying was overwhelming and it lingered for days on our clothes."}
{"text":"Food was great but I made a point to write a review for the high level of customer service we experienced last night. Scott K was very attentive to the serious allergy at our table. He double checked everything twice to ensure there would be no issues. Staff were also happy to split the bill which is something I always appreciate. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"This place had good ambience and located in a good spot close to bay and dundas.

Had an avacodo and beef burger.  Was really good cept little pricey 14$
 
Fries were good. service was good. if your looking to indulge, check it out."}
{"text":"We live close by.  Got take-out once -- great.  Went in and ate another time -- even better.  The salad I got (on top of my elk burger and fries!) was so fresh and great, which is not necessarily what you expect in a burger joint.  Good staff, laid-back vibe.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Sadly I've got to admit I was disappointed . Yes , the sweet potato fries rocked but the place isn't called Barefries . It's called Bareburger and the burger was dry and tasteless ! 
I asked for medium and clearly indicated that I wanted some pink colour in the middle. 
Instead I got the greyest , grimmest ,under seasoned ,unyielding piece of flesh I've eaten in a long time. The waitress didn't come around to ask if I was enjoying it  and when she cleared the table  she didn't seem to notice ( or care) that I'd left half of 
my meal on my plate.  
I won't be coming back . My neighborhood greasy spoon does a better job at a fraction of the price!"}
{"text":"Organic, delicious, natural flavours and great service. Highly recommend to any burger lover. Get the onion rings!"}
{"text":"Food was great. 

Tonight, service was lacking. 

A party of four entered and was promptly seated at 9:30.  Even though the dinning crowd was thinning we waited over 15 minutes for any servers to even acknowledge us let alone take a drink order. 

We saw that the staff was working on their closing duties so we decided to order our food at the same time that a server took pity on us and walked over. We ordered drinks off the menu and two made it to the table in a reasonable timeframe. 

The third came just before the burgers and the final drink made it to the table after the  burgers did.  Because we were sitting close to the bar I heard three separate servers offer to make my drink - a Manhattan on ice with extra bitters - but the drink never made it to the table. 

It may not seem like a big deal but the neglect of the staff and the awkward and unwelcome delay in our toast was a major detractor from our excellent food. 

Bottom line: if you are unwilling or unable to provide your best service for a party seated at 9:30 don't seat them. If the sign outside and Yelp says the that you are open till 10 - act like it. 

Maybe next time we'll have to order the food to go."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night,  had the Wild Hog burger,  with fries and a shake.

We were really looking forward to the shake so we ordered a strawberry and chocolate. Shake was nice and thick, but the chocolate and strawberry blend for some reason didn't jump out. 

Fries were nice and fresh and the burger was a little on the salty side.

Must tries are the special sauce and they curry lemon sauce. 

Service was good, and atmosphere was lively. 

Total came to $50 for the both of us.  


If organic and grass fed burgers are important to you,  then this place is a no-brainer.  But if you just want a decent burger around town there are many other options out there are a cheaper price."}
{"text":"A fabulous experience at Bareburger. We had top notch service and the food was fantastic and brought out relatively quickly. We never felt rushed. 

High quality, fresh ingredients all around. I had the Fire Quacker with beef instead of duck. The pickled jalapenos offered just the right amount of heat. None of the toppings overpowered the burger. 

My partner had the standard and loved it. We shared the rings & fries side and enjoyed trying out all the sauces. 

The Chocolate shake was excellent. Next time I will add peanut butter as per the waitress's suggestion. I had to try the standard one first!

We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Burgers were way over cooked, grey. However, we had the best server ever! She made it worth going for. The food:
Good Cali salad, would go back for that alone
Burgers: not great, so overcooked, a good burger should be medium rare, this was brown meat, tasty, but too well done
Wine: meh, not a good selection,
Beer :pretty sure they got the wrong one on tap
The only reason they got a 3 rating was due to our server Olivia! Would go back because of her!"}
{"text":"horrific service!!! food takes forever and there was only 4 other people in the restaurant! food isn't even good"}
{"text":"What a great place! From the ambiance, to the food to the service. Absolutely fantastic!
Our server, Eden was so great. She started by giving us a run-down of the menu and explaining that all the meats in the burgers can be swapped out for other meats. When I told her I was a vegetarian, she told me about which option she preferred. Let's take a moment to do a happy dance for the fact that they have more than one veggie option!!! :D
Ok now that that's out of the way, we ordered the the hot honey milkshake adding peanut butter, per Eden's recommendation. It's sweet with a little kick. Not your usual milk shake. For my main I ordered the Guadalupe with Sweet Fries. It was sooo good. Definitely not your usual soy veggie burger. In fact, both their veggie burgers are very unique. I can't wait to go back next time to try the other one."}
{"text":"This place is truly a HIT! The burgers are absolutely delicious and without a doubt the best in the city. It's nice that this restaurant is using  they such high quality meat and organic ingredients, which make their burgers so delicious!  The burgers are so juicy and come with perfectly paired toppings. The wild mushrooms on my burger were simply amazing! The menu is quite interesting as well. I came in with a large group and we all were impressed with our meals. The service was outstanding as well. Our meals arrived quickly and all at the same time. This is a perfect lunch place and I highly recommended it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit Bare burger for a while yesterday night I finally stepped in with a party of two. it was quite busy but service was quick and alright. I very much liked the aspect of mostly all Canadian ingredients (veggie burger was from New York) all local and very environmentally conscious restaurant. prices were as expected for the food. I ended up asking for a supreme. the taste of the meat as really good but aside from that it was lacking flavour, nothing amazing. They do have vegan shakes which I loved. 
One weird thing: the restaurant has a strange greasy smell that i still can't get off me even after two showers."}
{"text":"Was excited to give this place a try but was disappointed. I tried the elk bleu burger it was very dry, chewy, and tasteless I wasn't able to eat it. I never had elk before some maybe I didn't know what to expect but I thought it would at least have more flavor than it did. I did really enjoy the fries especially with the ginger ketchup and the onion rings were crispy and good. Basically the sides outperformed the main dish. If I Try this place again I will definitely be choosing a different burger."}
{"text":"I can't believe this closed down, my favourite burger place for both eating on site or ordering in :("}
{"text":"I like the place as it located centrally downtown and ambiance is comfy and casual, nothing fancy.  The service is friendly and helpful.  They serve burgers made of non common meats such as elk, bison, wild boar etc.  Come for the first time when burger crave is hitting.  Come after movie to catch a bite.  Ordered a wild boar wiki wiki burger with onion ring for the side.  I am pretty sure it's made to order so there is a bit of wait time but not too long.  When burger comes out it looks small but it's actually quite filling.  The toppings balance well and it's quite juicy and yummy.  The onion ring is seasoned well but it's definitely over done and it's battered too thick, so it tastes repetitive after few bites.
Overall it's a good option to grab a burger serve with meats like bison, elk etc.  The price is a bit pricy tho as my order comes with 20 dollar bill after tax.  They also serve weekend brunch but have't had chance to try it, perhaps next time."}
{"text":"This is legit! A variety of ground meats made into awesome burgers served on the bun of your choice. Sides are extra and worth it; house made dill pickles (make sure you fish out the pickled garlic) excellent fries and onion rings. Jade, the bartender knew the menu well and we settled on the wiki wiki, a wild boar burger with duck bacon and pineapple relish. Good but the burger could have been a tad juicer, perhaps cooked a few seconds less. Also, if the brioche bun had been toasted or grilled it would not have been soggy on the last few bites but I fear I am knit picking. The only thing that kept it from getting 5 stars was that the price point was a bit steep because of the al a carte menu but this is a destination that should be a part of every Toronto's foodies list."}
{"text":"We wanted to get a burger before we catch the show so we were in a time crunch. We didn't expect to be a line up at the restaurant but there was. So we got take-out instead. But even getting take-out took quite some time. There was only one person working at the counter, probably waited almost 10 minutes before she was able to take our order. Then waited for another 15 minutes before we got our food.

I got the Wiki Wiki burger ($13.25) - wild boar, gouda, duck bacon, onions, pineapple relish on brioche bun. The wild boar patty was good, juicy, not dry. There was crispy onions on top. I didn't taste much of the gouda though. The duck bacon was good, extra fat on the patty and the bun was toasted. Overall, not a bad burger, but wish there was more gouda on it. We also got sweet potato fries ($4.85), the sweet potatoes seem extra sweet, like it was dip in syrup or something before it was cooked. It was overpriced though for sure. The white peach ice-tea was a disappointment, tasted like water, no white peach flavour what so ever.

Like many gourmet burger places, overpriced for just a damn burger. May or may not return here."}
{"text":"Carnivores and herbivores rejoice. Bareburger is a one stop shop where the needs of even the fussiest eater will be met. I checked it out yesterday after hearing a bit of hype about it and it certainly did not disappoint. My order was a Bison burger with pimento cheese, back bacon and onion and fig jam,  a side order of their sweet potato fries and a choc peanut butter shake to wash it all down. The server was even nice enough to throw in a little bit of their buttermilk ranch dressing. My s/o had a supreme burger with onion rings and from the looks of it she was incredibly stoked with the meal too. For my part, I just couldn't have asked for more. The Bison burger patty was succulent. The bacon, thick and juicy. And the shake... Oh the shake!  Bit of chocolate and peanut butter tap dancing on my taste buds had me begging for more, if only I wasn't extremely full from the other fare. To summarise, great food, great atmosphere, excellent service. Sure it's pricey, but you get what you pay for. They even have vegan and gluten free options. 
TLDR: Great food, great service and great options as long as you are willing to shell out the coin."}
{"text":"Came here with 6 friends, we all ordered different burgers.. Sadly 4 of the burgers were dry and not as tasty. Price is pretty expensive considering the burgers do not come with any sides. Not to our likings, but maybe others might."}
{"text":"Service was very good but the food was very mediocre. I ordered the Hog Wild which was dry and the fried egg in the burger was over cooked. The place has a nice atmosphere but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Solid spot for those seeking more than just your average burger!  Great ambience, quality and service, to go with the many veggie options (not to mention the sides, sauces and desserts)!  Will definitely be back soon..."}
{"text":"Hungry? Just wait until Christmas, because that's probably when you'll finally get what you ordered for (and by then, you won't want it.)

Bare Burger has all of the makings of a potentially great restaurant: industrial-chic deco, a bustling location, trendy menu items, and more game-y fare for the adventurous. On the surface, it appeals to almost any diet and anyone. As my boyfriend lives right around the corner in the condominium next door to the establishment, I really, really wanted to like this place. We counted down the days until it opened, were one of the first customers to dine at the store and grab a menu to-go, and were extremely excited to make it our new go-to place.

And here's where Bare Burger disappoints. It lacks the sense of community, the high quality (or at least competent) customer service, and the effort that would make a good restaurant, and which it appears to offer on the outside. The first time I went, I went with the customizable burger option. The server didn't even know what the prices were when I asked him, and fumbled around having to ask different people several times when I asked for some of the toppings and options available on the customizable menu (oddly enough, none of the servers he spoke to knew the prices or were familiar with it either.) Although my order was a simple one,
he seemed to be making up prices as we went along. My burger came to a whopping $20+. This didn't include sides or anything, but I didn't mind, expecting something that would at least live up to its price. It didn't. My complaint that time around wasn't the burger, though; it was the staff's lack of transparency with their pricing and lack of familiarity with it. By the time I realized my burger would be more than I'd expected, I felt so bad for making the server go through all of the trouble that I decided to just go ahead with the order.

I tried to give Bare Burger another chance today and even went with some friends. We all wanted to like it, but one of my friends was severely unimpressed with her order (the Blue Elk burger,) and so was I. I ordered a salad with lemon poppyseed dressing and panko fried chicken. Skip the salads if you go here: they're pricy, underdressed, and just overall underwhelming. The panko was more of a pankNO: it had no flavour and was extremely hard to chew and even cut into.

However, the icing on the cake was the service. We all wanted to try their fries (I had a decent memory of them the last time I had gone,) and placed an order to share. By the time our mains were all out, the side of fries and onion rings were no where to be seen. After flagging down our server, who never
came by to check on us (despite it not being too busy,) she didn't hesitate to assure us that our side would come. Cue over half an hour later, and it still hadn't arrived. We actually had to ask her politely two more times, and both times she said they were on their way. In the meantime, we watched as groups that had ordered long after us receive their side dishes and meals. The fries and onion rings never arrived- we all finished our meal with a long wait that cumulated in me finally speaking to our server, who told me unapologetically, \"So do you still want the fries, or what?\" Sorry, but we didn't wait almost an hour, maybe more, and finish off our meals to wait an extra length of time for a simple order of fries and onion rings. We ended up asking her to cancel the order, as we were done with waiting and just so unimpressed and disappointed with the service. She did nothing and said nothing to amend the situation, just shrugged indifferently and walked away. I felt embarrassed to have suggested the place to my friends in the first place, which rarely happens and is never a good sign.

Long story short: Bare Burgers has decent burgers. But maybe place an order of fries a year in advance if you'd like to dine at Bare Burger? Or, better yet, just don't bother. If an establishment can't handle training its servers or serving a table of just five rather undemanding customers, it should really rethink its approach. For fail-proof, delicious burgers that ARE worth the trek and time, try The Works or Burger's Priest or Johnny Burgers instead."}
{"text":"Good place to try some specialty burger meat patties. The meat patties were quite unique. My friend and I both enjoyed trying something different than what we're accustomed to.

Food: 
Had their preset burgers since it was my first time there and I didn't know what combination would taste best. I was a bit disappointed. It tasted good but didn't have the wow factor for the combination. Portion was a bit small for the price, it would have been nice if there we're some small sides included.

Service:
Great! They explained the menu to us and the waitress recommended a few things to us based on what we were in the mood for.

Decor:
Some unique items sprinkled on the walls.  Overall nice but the tables were a bit too close together for my liking. I didn't feel like I had privacy as the table next to us would be able to hear us clearly.

{"text":"This is the one we've been waiting for. Bare Burger features fresh ingredients, incredible patty choice, an inventive and delicious collection of burger creations, and some of the best desserts around.  It features all natural, organic, non-GMO items, so right there that's a great start.

There are a plethora of patties - beef, elk, wild boar, Turkey, duck, and a few non-meat items too. The toppings are varied and I won't bore you with the details but they are worth checking out. I went with some family and between us we had most or all of the red meats - I had a tasty item called the Wiki Wiki, which is a wild boar burger topped with some sweet things.  We also split an order or onion rings, fries, and wasabi carrot slaw.  We were very pleased - two standout items: the burgers (obviously) are coked fresh to order and wonderful to taste, and the fries come with terrific dipping sauces. Notably, the ketchup and mustard at the table are great too!

Lastly I need to say a few words about the desserts.  I had the vanilla and hot honey milkshake. WOW. It is sweet and then just as it hits your through you feel the wild warmth of the spiced honey. I cannot recommend it enough. Simple and beautiful. We also all sampled the ice cream Sammies. Chocolate peanut butter and \"Snooker Doodle\". The chocolate peanut butter was fantastic but the snooker doodle really knocked us all flat - it tastes exactly like toasted marshmallows. You might have heard about some gourmet ice cream sandwich places that have cropped up. Well I can say with ease that this burger place knocks them all out of the water.

So if you near Bay and Dundas, and even if you aren't, make sure to come here!"}
{"text":"The brunch was way too fried and left a bad aftertaste. Amazingly, I think Denny's next door is probably a better choice."}
{"text":"Anyone who takes their burgers seriously knows the key to a great burger is great toppings. Bareburger does not disappoint - great selections of toppings not to mention sides and drinks. Veggie burgers can be hit or miss, but this one is definitley a hit. The topper was the service -- the staff are friendly and helpful without being over-the-top."}
{"text":"I can't even express how excited I am to have found a place that offers hormone & antibiotic free and organic options. Being a bit of a health nut and gluten & dairy intolerant it's not always easy finding a good spot to eat out. After a friend's recommendation to try Bareburger I came by for dinner tonight and was not disappointed!
The atmosphere was simple, charming and very comfortable. Our server Eden was amazing - very friendly, accommodating and honest. Now to the food - I had the quinoa burger wrapped in collard which was DELICIOUS. My fellow diners had the beef burger on a brioche, the Guadalupe remixed to be the \"Eden special\" on a collard leaf with a Peach Iced tea, the Hot Honey Chicken Sandwich & a milkshake and we shared a salad, onion rings and fries. My little cousin had the Koala meal and a kid's sundae and he loved it which was incredible (it's hard to convince a 4 year old to eat on the healthier side especially eating out, and it feels good knowing he got and enjoyed some good quality food!)
The only negative thing I'd have to say is I wish the burgers came with a side included. 
Will definitely be coming back! Definite thumbs up."}
{"text":"I was actually really impressed by this place.
I was expecting just a regular burger joint but was pleasanlty surprised  to find that they have  all kinds of different flavours and toppings.
This is like the Wvurst of burgers.
I had the \"Hog Wild\" with fronions. This burger has a FRIED EGG in it! do I need to say more?  
Our waitress was super nice and friendly and highly recommended the Wiki Wiki. I will be back to try it soon."}
{"text":"Some of the yummiest burgers (and onion rings) in Toronto plus good service.  The Duck Burger is my favourite , it is quite good and unique.  However, I do think the place is slightly pricey for a casual burger joint."}
{"text":"I went to Bareburger for the first time today. I had high expectations for the restaurant as my friends have raved about this place since it's been open in Toronto for a little while now.

As we entered the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice an overwhelming scent of oil and grease in dining area. However, that wasn't a big deal and we were seated promptly and given our menus. The menu is structured so that you can order a set burger or you could customize your own. I was advised by my friend to not customize a burger as it comes out to be super expensive and overpriced. I ordered the Blue Elk burger, which was elk with blue cheese, peameal bacon, and tomato fig jam. We also ordered the onion rings and fries to share. 

I was very underwhelmed by the burger: the meat was not as juicy as I thought it would be, and the bun was not warm which sort of ruined the burger for me. The tomato fig jam (I think it was sun dried tomato and fig) was also very oily and the bottom half of my bun was just covered in grease and I didn't enjoy that either. Also I didn't think the peameal bacon really added anything to the burger. Overall the taste was decent with the kick of blue cheese and the sweetness from the tomato fig jam.

As for the onion rings and sweet fries, I never got the chance to try them. Our mains came and we told the waitress that our side did not come yet. She said she would follow up with the kitchen but never came back to give us an update. We started eating our mains and watched as the tables around us ordered from the same waitress and got all their sides promptly while we were still waiting for ours. We talked to the waitress at least two more times before we decided to cancel the order because we were all done eating the mains and gave up on the idea of those sides.

I am giving Bareburger two stars because I thought the burger was mediocre for a place that specializes in making burgers. Also, as a first time customer, I was very disappointed by the service I was given today. If I am in the area, I may go back to give the restaurant another shot. But I definitely would not purposely make a trip downtown to eat there."}
{"text":"I tried everything g off their menu and it was delicious. 
They have fig jam as one of their toppings and it's just delicious and I have fig anything . Not sure why they closed down. They had healthy/gluten free options"}
{"text":"Great!!! Just great! Get the burger with the collard green wrap instead of the bun. The hot honey chicken sandwich is ridiculously yummy! And curry ginger sauce in the fries? Yowza... Go get you some now!"}
{"text":"I was walking back to my hotel room after attending a conference that day, looking for something both quick and healthy.  I stopped in and took a look at the menu, which looked promising.  I'm glad I did - the food is great!  Both healthy and delicious, and with nice decor.  I recommend!"}
{"text":"Just what Toronto needed, a great concept with a focus on Organic and All Natural products, and the NEW Best Burger in Toronto!! 

The service was great, and the atmosphere was full of fun. We saw the whole team sing Happy Birthday! Now that's a first."}
{"text":"My friend and I got there around 6pm,it was early for dinner time, so not too many people showed up yet ( when we finished, the whole house was packed). And the server was really nice and put us to a booth which is normally served for 6 people. She also recommended the most popular burger after known that was our first time visiting the place.
I end up got the elk burger, amazing source, the meat didnt have a strong flavour and tasted a little bit gamey, and the source tasted sour and  spicy which kind of balanced out with both bacon and elk.
I also ordered the side comb of onion rings and sweet fries, very crispy, deep fried but not too oily, I didn't add any ketchup and the taste was just fine.
Strongly recommend, it's a must-go-back."}
{"text":"Regular burger was DELICIOUS! Among the best I've ever had :) Soft, juicy meat and bun - only thing was the portion was on the small side. Fries were average, onion rings over done. Loses a star based on price ($25+ for 1 person) and lacklustre fries"}
{"text":"I visited with my friends in the evening when it was pretty busy. The server was helpful with ordering. Following his advice, I ordered El Matador.
The burgers came stacked up. It was hard to eat with my hands so I had to use the folk and knife after a few bites. I am not a big fan of burgers that are hard to eat, but this burger had good flavours. The ingredients were fresh, and the meat (bison) was cooked perfectly. 
As for the fries and onion rings, they were alright. I did not like the set of four dipping sauces that came with the dish. Only the habanero sauce went well with the fries. I would have been happy to have just that and the ketchup.
I noticed that the drinks were almost $4. You get one refill if it's from the fountain and otherwise no refill. The fountain only had like diet coke and one other drink so I just drank water. My friend ordered a lemonade instead, but it tasted bland. I think they can use some improvements in the drinks section.
To sum up, I liked the atmosphere and the service came on time. Above anything, the burger had a great taste. Next time I feel like having a fancy burger, I may consider visting this place again."}
{"text":"With the signs, sidewalk chalkboard, and notes on the menu advertising their use of non-GMO, grass-fed meat products, you know what kind of restaurant this will be. 

There is a heavy emphasis on organic ingredients and calorie-informed eating. With a focus on the extension beyond the regular beef patty into a wider range of game, all meats are on the lean side.  If you're so inclined, there's a nutritional information sheet at every table by the condiments holder. 

The menu starts with larger format sharing plates of side dishes, averaging $11.  On the flip side of the menu, you'll find these sides for a single persons' portion for roughly $3. Above these are the burgers, both pre-built and customs build options available. 

Today I had the Fire Quacker, the duck burger on a white brioche bun, with a side of duck bacon and dill pickles.  I really regret getting the duck bacon - for almost $3 for 4 thin round slices, I didn't feel it was worth the money at all.  I like my bacon nice and heavy, but this one was more like a lean meat from a charcuterie sample. The price was just way too steep for what you get. 

The dill pickles from a 101-year old recipe were OK.  I had expected a couple spears or full pickles, but they actually came in slices (the kind that you'd find sandwiched in your burger). Not the best I've had, but also not the worst.  Quite vinegary. 

All in all, I'd say it's OK if you're looking for a healthy type of burger but you'll likely be disappointed if you're looking for that old charcoal grill burger taste."}
{"text":"Really like this place and the overall concept. I'm gluten and dairy free, but burgers are my favourite food group, which is a bit of a conflict with my diet, haha. Bareburger has great gluten free options. I had the bison burger on their specialty gluten free bun and it was unreal. 
I actually ordered them for delivery through Just Eat (fun fact- you can get Bareburger delivered to your front door and it is fantastic) and was also really happy with the quality of my food when it showed up in take out containers. 

ONLY thing I didn't like-- not enough pickles with my side order! Hahah. I ordered a side of dill pickles and it seemed like one single pickle chopped up in a little cup. I guess it just wasn't the portion I was expecting. 
That's honestly my only (small) complaint."}
{"text":"This place rates better than a three - a three and a half for sure and maybe even a four. It is straightforward and authentic.... no pretense and no frills... just good service and good food and good prices. 

I had one of the made to order burgers and it was exactly as ordered - the brioche bun fresh, the burger done to a safe medium well (fans of rare hand chopped burgers need to look elsewhere) but perfectly so - toppings appropriately arranged. It all arrives with a skewer through it that is large enough to require a license ... the one bit of artifice but it's fun. 

The service is pleasant and straight up. No time wasted but completely interested in your experience. 

It is my second visit... there will be more."}
{"text":"My fave burger joint. Tastes so fresh and healthy. Worth the premium price cuz of the premium quality and the social-environmental cause."}
{"text":"The salads are just incredible!! You have to taste their grilled chicken! The ceasar and hudson was just incredibly tasty."}
{"text":"Our family loved this place.  The duck patty, bison, black bean and sweet potato/kale burgers were excellent.  The onion rings were huge and fries flavorful.  Best of all it is organic or all natural, including some beers."}
{"text":"Amazing little joint for burgers and casual fare.  The food is made with fresh organic ingredients and the prices are very reasonable.  

My friends and I came here for burgers and shakes.  All of which was very yummy.  I had the El matador, the bison patty was very flavourful, toppings were light and the bun was soft and fresh.

My friends had milk shakes as well which tasted very good.  Not too sweet and not overly thick and creamy like other places."}
{"text":"I am a burger person and I was quite disappointed by their burgers. The cooking options don't go below Medium and the medium one is cooked in a way that makes it dry and without much meat taste. The blue cheese doesn't have a strong taste either. The brioche buns however are soft and tasty."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here while I was attending jury selection down the street. Nice quaint little place, artistic decor and friendly staff.  I had the standard with fries.  You can definitely taste the freshness and quality in the food.  I could tell the chef prepared my meal without haste.  The one reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the gravy tasted really weird. Not sure if it was because I'm used to a sodium filled version, but it kind of turned me off...I will definitely be back, but not too soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the guadalupe burger and the sweet potato fries, and I was underwhelmed - I've had better veggie burgers elsewhere.  The patty is made from black beans, but it's a bit bland.  The bun is called a \"sprout bun\".  It was way too heavy, and it was all I could taste.  The burger also had guacamole on it, which was tasty.  The sweet potato fries were good, and the dipping sauce they came with was very very yummy.  My boyfriend ordered the fire quacker burger, and it was pretty small.  I thought the meal was a bit expensive, for what you get.  Our bill for 2 burgers and shared fries was about $40, so not really worth is for the price, in my opinion.  The fact that the food is organic isn't a big selling point for me."}
{"text":"Wow! Just had the County Fare with a side of sweet potato fries. The bison was cooked perfectly and the flavour was on point. Many other places overcook bison, but not here. The sweet potato fries were equally enjoyable as they were crisp, but no greasy. Just the right amount of spices on them as well.

Like how everything is organic and from Canada. Awesome job!

The lady who took my order was friendly and upbeat. The receipt says Am B, so I say thank you to her as well as Happy Birthday (per the button she wore). 

The restaurant is rather smallish, but looks comfortable and like it'd be a nice place in which to dine. I chose take out since I'm running a marathon tomorrow.

This was my first time dining here and I'm from out of town. Next time I'm in Toronto though, I'll be dining here again.

Awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was great! Loved the selection.

We ordered the Matador Burger, one of the Fried Chicken Sandwiches, and a share of Fries and Rings. I love the rings, they're huge! The special sauce is my favourite dip. 

It is quite pricy compared to other burgers, but you shouldn't be eating burgers every day anyways! If you're going to treat yourself then definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I ordered the supreme burger with fries. The food tasted great, service was amazing. The only negative point is that the food took forever to come out.

I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Their stance on sustainabile and ethical food sourcing is commendable and I like the informative reading on the table that explains all of their ingredients and where they get them. Small, but well laid out interior, everything is wood which is cool. All the staff was helpful and attentive, and the food came out relatively fast. The milkshake was amazing. They have a bunch of flavors you can mix. The fries and onion rings were some of the best I've ever had. So tasty they didn't need ketchup. But their ketchup is fresh and delicious, you will use ketchup. The burgers were good - but not \"great!\". Both I tried were slightly overcooked (not terribly overcooked). Great sides and shakes, decent burgers."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a few coworkers for lunch today. We really liked the large variety of burgers that was offered and how customizable they were. I had the fire quaker (duck) that I really enjoyed.(but kinda  wish that I had ordered a beef burger instead ) My coworkers all really liked their burgers as well! We also shared the onion rings (which are huge) and fries and we liked how it was served with 4 different and more unique dipping sauces. 

Service was a bit slow at some points but they were friendly. My coworkers also really liked the decor of the place. Overall I would definitely come back to try some of their other burgers!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the waitress was nice. I had the elk burger but it doesn't taste different from beef. It is fairly expensive for the portion of food but it is definitely worth trying"}
{"text":"This place had great options and I loved how it had organic and all natural ingredients. We spontaneously chose this joint and the service and ambience was great. I had the lunch special of crispy chicken wth hot honey and pickle sliders and my friend had a wiki wiki burger. It tasted fine but nothing incredibly different or special in our opinions and the portion was quite small so definitely order sides to fill yourself up!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre burgers. They have meats like elk and bison, but they're cooked in a way that it just tastes like anything else. 

The highlight of this place for us was the snickerdoodle ice cream sandwich (lol!) which was deeelicious"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers, a little on the pricy side. The burger was fresh and full of flavour. The fries were also great. Overall would definitely recommend again."}
{"text":"Teletoon retro playing on the bar TV... 'nough said 
Draught beer served in 34oz steins... again, why are you not here yet? 
As much organic, natural, green shiz as possible... need I say more?? 

Decor is simply amazing. (read awesomesauce modern contemporary) 
Every detail is taken care of. They tried to use as much repurposed and recycled items as possible. 
From the full wooden custom chairs made in Ohio to the sprinklers used as coat hangers at the bar and right down to the continent holder. It's all awesome. 

Now down to the important stuff! 
The beer is reasonably priced for this kind of spot when ordered in a stein or 60oz pitcher. 
The burger, completely customizable! 
Righteous and unique ingredients. 
Please refer to the menu pics for reference. 

Servers were amazing and explained every ingredient we wanted to know about. 

Very fresh, very fun, very tasty, try this asap."}
{"text":"4 star average?!  Really?   I'm glad I didn't check yelp before going or else I would have been even more disappointed.  

The main disappointment I guess comes from the burger patties themselves which were dried almost to a crumble.  Especially disappointing because not only did the menu advertise medium-well, but I made it specifically a point to order medium (the lowest they go).  There was not a semblance of pink in the patty.  The only pink was the almost homogenous goo of \"topping\" that was just combined all the flavours I was supposed to enjoy on the burger.  The bun was unmemorable and slightly reminiscent of McDonald's value menu (is calling something both unmemorable and reminiscent a contradiction?).

Shake was okay.  I would have preferred somewhat thicker. I like a little bit of struggle with the shakes. 

Sweet potato fries were good, slightly heavy on the salt.  The mustard was really good.

Service was good too.  No complaints.  Overall most things about this place were good (though not remarkable), but not enough to make up for the burger itself, and I feel that deserves a heavier weight."}
{"text":"I ordered the standard burger and my husband got wild boar burger with fries and onion rings. Love the burgers there but only one thing is I should have ordered medium as my preference. ( their red meats are cooked medium well) We definitely want to go back to try Elk burger."}
{"text":"4/5 - Very good burger, not great.

I like Bareburger. It's delicious. It has options. The curry ginger kethcup was pretty amazing, and their brioche bun was pretty top notch.

But where they failed me (relatively) was the patty itself. They say medium on their menu, but what I got was... not. I'd wager it was a bit too lean (if you're doing a burger, you gotta go 70/30 medium ground, not leaner than that).

So yeah - it's good. It's pretty damn good. But it ain't delicious like Harbord Room."}
{"text":"It was a last minute decision to pop in for a late dinner (around 9pm on a Friday). We were seated within 10 mins of waiting and after taking a look at the menu we decided to opt for the following:
- Macho Fries 
- Fire Quacker 

Both items were fairly average and nothing really stood out. The one thing I noted about this place is hat the burger does not come with sides, if you want sides you have to order additionally.

The idea of the place is unique but I likely will not return."}
{"text":"I had SUCH high expectations for this place, based on Yelp, and based on peeking at the menu online but I was sadly pretty disappointed when I visited Bareburger. 

Positives first; the ambiance was really nice with a western theme inside the restaurant. The tables and chairs were wooden and had a rustic look and all the staff were wearing plaid shirts, super cute. 

We got drinks to start, iced tea and lemonade, non-alcoholic . I'm not sure if this is common practice or not but both drinks didn't have any sweetener in it. Unfortunately for me, I was expecting something along the lines of super sweet strawberry lemonade, like Wendy's but amped up. I customized one of the preset burgers by adding a couple things, changing up the bun and making substitutions, they had no problems with any of that. 

Then the burgers arrived. As soon as I took my first bite, the entire burger fell apart. I couldn't pick it up anymore because everything was too slippery and it wasn't staying together. For a place that specializes in burgers and only burgers, shouldn't one of their main goals be to make burgers that stay together? This disappointed me the most, I proceeded to eat the rest of my burger with a knife and fork. Taste-wise, it was delicious.

For sides we got the rings and sweet fries and they were really really good. The onion rings were easily the biggest one's I've ever had and they came with 4 dips which were all equally as delicious. 

I'd like to visit BareBurger again to give it another shot; I'd easily return for the onion rings alone!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the idea for this place. Super chic and trendy decor, a build-your-own-burger option, organic meat, and a great selection of different types of meat (elk, bison, chicken, duck, beef etc) ... this place is spot on! Was only able to fit in a Grindhouse burger (elk) and some macho fries (jalapeno + guac + cheese) but boy they were both so hearty and delicious. The elk was a little less juicy than a regular beef burger, but I enjoyed the taste which wasn't too gamey and the sauces/other fixings really brought out some great flavours.
Definitely have to come back here to try the rest of their burgers for that last star."}
{"text":"Just went to this place last week and had one of the best burgers I've ever had!! Highly recommend trying the Elk - healthy, great taste and premium meat at a great price.. can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"I found their burger to be outstanding, the bun was doughy and sweet and the burger along with its toppings were spectacular. Overall one of the best burgers in the city. Very juicy and cooked perfectly. I also had the onion rings and fries combo, and found the onion rings to be really good, but the fries were lacking, I may be wrong, but they appeared to be frozen fries not fresh cut, and the onion rings seemed to be the same, they just didn't seem fresh made at all, and being a franchise, that's is likely the case. Overall I'd definitely return for the burgers and maybe the onion rings, but will pass on the fries."}
{"text":"This place knows how to make a great burger. At first sight, burger seems small, however the patty is very juicy and filling. All the combos are delicious and work even though they do sound odd. Service was friendly and conversational. Meal overall was   Delicious and filling.. Drinks were overpriced but beers are 20oz for nine dollars so it's pretty fair! Great location right dT in the core, definitely will go back to try another option when I'm craving some meat"}
{"text":"This is everything I'm looking for when I need some red meat protein. I had the lean bison burger on the Cali salad. The salad has fresh hummus, baby kale, watermelon radish, red quinoa and colourful cherry tomatoes. The staff are attentive and the prices are more than reasonable for the quality. They have happy hour at 3PM too!"}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch, so the restaurant was empty. I had a Wiki Wiki, which is wild boar with duck bacon, gouda, pineapple relish and onions. Burger was on the small side, but it tasted delicious. Maybe it could have used a bit more of the toppings, since the last third of the burger I ate ended up being just bun and patty, but still good. The onion rings were cooked to a perfect crisp, not burnt. I love that they serve Sir Kensington's ketchup, which is a huge step up from the standard."}
{"text":"Great service! Perky! Interesting food mixes! Tasty stuff! Good staples - fries, rings, shakes. Drawback is the HIGH cost! We split a salad, fries. & a shake, each having a burger, and the bill cleared $50. Yow!"}
{"text":"Always had great food here except today - their cleanness is of major concern...found a strand of hair in my drink. I'm willing to pay more for organic food, but who knows how they are handled...prob won't return again."}
{"text":"Stopped by bareburger for a simple after work dinner. The first thing that struck me was how cute the restaurant was (ie. There is a sticker of bear holding a spatula on the window)!! We were immediately welcomed and seated with water. The first thing you'll see on the menu is the expensive salad selection! The small bowls averaged around $9 and larger ones closer to $12. On top of that, if you wanted protein, it was another $3-$4. The burgers averaged $12 so it seemed like the better option. Both my friend and I wanted to try the duck, though we were tempted by wild boar, elk, and bison. I was thoroughly impressed at how customizable the menu was designed. Will have to come back to the the collard greens wrap as a bun! ;)"}
{"text":"The advertisements for their clean and organic foods is what really raises the bar at this burger joint. The atmosphere is casual but still nice catering to a few young professionals as well as some younger college students. There are so many options for burgers whether it's beef, duck, pork, turkey, or chicken. It was actually difficult to choose what I wanted to eat since everything looked tasty! I ended up ordering the fried chicken bites app with spicy honey mustard sauce, turkey burger, and a normal beef burger. The appetizer was a little overfried for my liking and the sauce on top of it was very heavy and there was a lot of it. If I were to order this again, I'd ask for sauce on the side and a little less frying time. The burgers itself were really good! The turkey burger is definitely the more healthy part of our dinner with sprouts and guacamole on a whole grain burger bun but it tasted nice. The beef burger was amazing on a brioche bun and the burger cooked to medium. The quality of the meat really shined through since we got minimal toppings on this burger. All together, a good meal with a nice casual atmosphere and a good stop if you're shopping in the area. There is a bar here with some big screen tvs for those nights you want to catch a game with your buddies."}
{"text":"Very good burger, service is as expected if not better than average. Pricy for the burger if you build your own. I had fires with my custom burger ( premium meet) bison. And POP total was 27 with tax. So make sure your ok with the price. I will be back. Look for pics on my Pinterest boards. Trying to add a photo on Yelp is not easy."}
{"text":"Omg the food here is to die for. 
This was by far the best burger I have ever had! My server was great, he sugvested that I get the Rings and Sweet Fries. They were deliciois and the rings were HUGE. 
Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Really enjoyed the build your own burger menu and variety of meat choices. Duck, bison, elk etc. Fresh ingredients and super tasty, would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys healthier food options that taste great."}
{"text":"This is a cool organic burger spot near Yonge and Dundas square. We ended up there on a Wednesday night and it was pretty packed for a Wednesday. The burger patty options are pretty good for both meat lovers and vegans. My husband and I had burgers from their preset menu however they have the option to create your own. My husband had the buckaroo and I had the Guadalupe  (black bean patty). The buckaroo seem to be really good as my husband enjoyed. However my patty was good but the bun was too dry and the guacamole was top notch! We also had the Mexican chocolate milkshake it was good but a little spicy! 
The onion rings were pretty good. We just got one side of onion rings and shared it as they were pretty big size. 
Overall good spot, would I go again? Maybe!"}
{"text":"I actually quite enjoyed the food at Bareburger (we tried The Standard burger and the Hash Sheesh bowl), but I couldn't get over the service. It wasn't even bad service. It was more like lack of service. There were two wait staff working while we were there for lunch. The waiter who served our table was pleasant. He was polite, apologetic, and always wore a smile on his face. But the other waitress was on her phone sitting at one of the booths 80% of the time we were there. The other waiter was doing most of the work. We waited a long time to get water for our table and the bill, but I couldn't blame the guy cuz he was busy serving other tables while that waitress was on her phone the entire time we were waiting. And this girl looked angry the whole time we were there. This is extremely unacceptable even if she's the manager. I was honestly appalled and don't understand why she was even there if she wasn't going to do any work..."}
{"text":"The highlight of this place is that you can customize your burger with a large selection of normal and exotic meats and toppings (ie. Elk,
Duck, etc). I was excited to try my wild boar burger, but it was disappointing. The meat tasted incredibly dry and the bread left a stale feeling in my mouth. Our server was attentive for the first little bit but disappeared midway through our meal. Although I don't like going to another server, I had to ask our neighbouring table's server for more water to wash out the over greasy taste of their fries. I should have gone to the Works instead!"}
{"text":"I had the hog wild and the hubby had the firecracker ! The firecracker from the bite I had was too spicy for me but the hubby loved it ( cannot eat spicy for the life of me) 

The burger that I had was so well prepared! I thought that they brought me a cold burger but once i took a bite of it, was I ever wrong! The burger was cooked t perfection, hot and juicy! Not too hot that u are unable to eat it but hot enough! Mine had an egg in it and the egg was fried to perfection crisp and very tasty! 

We also order a ginger green ice tea with honey, it was so refreshing and totally cooled you down especial on a stuffy day like today! Went well with the burgers :)"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in town. 

Largest range of paddies to choose from; duck to your usual juicy beef paddies. You can customize your own burger, or choose from their already designed extremely creative burgers. 

Drinks are tasty as well. Although the place is a little small and you'll want to call beforehand for dinner. Servers are friendly, and everything is wonderful. 

Lastly, onion rings! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Went in here on a Wed night and had a great time thanks to Olivia. Ordered a build-your-own burger with some sweet potato fires and a beer. Food came out in good time but there was some delay between when the burger came out and when the fries came out. The burger tasted great but when I was done with it I wished the burger patty had been bigger. I was almost ready to order another burger since the first one left me still feeling a little hungry. Sweet potato fries were great. Beer was good and Olivia was awesome."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

Decent burgers, not as good as holy chuck or burger priest, but your traditional chunky grilled burger. Had beef and duck, both are good. Duck wasn't anything special. Lots of good options to choose from. Aged cheese was ok, not as mature or sharp as I would prefer.  Didn't ask me how I wanted my meat. Comes well done every time  I eat here. 

Had poutine, was ok, nothing special. Gravy was forgettable.  Onion rings are nice large and chunky. 

Have some decent ginger ale or ginger brew. Sweet and spicy. 

Otherwise, best burgers in the area for now. Excellent service."}
{"text":"It's my first time here for lunch and I cannot say enough good things about the place.  Amazing service: first I was greeted by the hostess who showed me to the table, then the server greeted my and gave me an orientation on how to use the menu, then another server poured my water, and lastly one of the management asked me how I liked my lunch. 

I had the hot fried chicken wich and a side of baby greens. All the food here, by the way, is organic and they also have gluten free options. The presentation of the sandwich was gorgeous, aside from being amazingly delicious. The carrot wasabi slaw and pineapple relish toppings on the crispiest fried chicken. The salad is drizzled with avocado basil dressing. 

I'm excited about coming back to try more of this great menu. 

Tell your friends!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! So cute and hipster. It gets a little packed so try avoiding the lunch rush. The food was very flavourful, and it also feels nice to know they're healthy (minus the deep fried part). The food took a while to come out even when the place was slow but that's definitely my only complaint! Definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Our first family vacation with our 2  1/2 year old and 1 year old turned out to be a rousing success ... except when it came to meal time. A favorite destination is Niagara Falls and Toronto CA. As single people in love, we would take our bikes and ride through wineries in Niagara On The Lake and visit Center Island in Toronto. This was our first trip with our kids. \"Where are we going?\" would be the words that will haunt our dreams.

After some quick Yelp searching, my wife found Bareburger. A place where she can get a veggie burger and her husband could get some dead cow. I'm glad we arrived when we did, because seating was limited. After a quick scan of the menu we placed our order. I don't really remember too much after that.

SCREAMING ... YELLING ... food flying everywhere. My kids decided that Bareburger would be the place to find out just how many buttons mommy had. But then ... in the distance ... came a light of hope that took the form of our server. She was quick to offer us a booth and away from the center table. She was quick with the crayons (that took 5 minutes to break). She got the kids meals out first before the first shoe came off. And she provided that small window of distraction while I wiped the mustered off my ear.

Bareburger has some amazing grub for some terrible kids. My advice ... 1.) Don't forget to order the pickles like we did, 2.) Always show up early, and 3.) Make your kids walk there to burn off some energy before you walk in.

Sorry for the mess Bareburger."}
{"text":"I've been to this bareburger location twice now and both times were quite enjoyable. Lots of different cuts of meat available at this location and they promote a healthier style in burgers and fries. Their onion rings are amazing here! Super crispy and crunchy and I think they're coated with quinoa. 

Burgers are cooked to medium rare (or however the meat can be cooked for), they don't just serve beef, but also have Elk, Lamb, turkey and other kinds of meat.

Custom built burgers is also an option as well. Lots to choose from! Milkshakes also seem really delish and prices are fare.

I find the burgers here are not as salty as well but still has a lot of flavour. Definitely will come back when I have a burger craving and want to \"feel\" healthy-ish too"}
{"text":"Great service by friendly waiter. Burgers were solid, and cooked to my liking (Medium) which isn't common in Canada. Onion rings were a solid addition and prices were fair. Would recommend this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this restaurant- customers being able to create the exact burger they want, whether it's beef, bison, turkey, vegan. The options are endless, even with the toppings and sauces. If you order a burger with onion rings, be prepared to see the most massive onion ring you probably would ever see. 

I had the turkey burger and felt like it was way too dry. However the toppings and the fries were really good."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a shot last night, since I live right by and walk by this place basically every day. I had heard great things about the place. The burgers are good. I had the County fair burger with a side of onion rings and fries. The reason I'm giving this place an one star rating is the fact that I had to wait an hour for the food to come. I mean more than an hour wait for burgers?! During that time, about 3-4 tables of people that came after us, were served before we even got our food. This in my mind made no sense. We were told that our food was on the way a hand full of times. After a VERY long wait, our food finally arrived. The waiter was super nice and friendly and apologized a number of times. But what really threw me off was that we were told that the manager was to come and talk to us, yet at the end he decided not too. So, my overall opinions was that the food was good, but not worth the ridiculous wait. Also, I wasn't impressed by the management and the organization of the place."}
{"text":"I was in bareburger in New York and was really impressed by the food, style and service. The waitress told me that \"you,guys,have the same bar in Toronto\", so I decided to find the place and compare my experience. 

I'm giving three stars just because the meat was really nice and the waiter was deeply sorrow about the fact that they'd run out of bison. Ok, apology accepted.

Burger itself is nothing comparing it with its U.S. doppelgänger. Beer choice is limited but still acceptable, anyway, they aren't an actual bar.

But what was really bad was the absence of the atmosphere and the fact that tables aren't cleaned is disgusting! May be I was unlucky but tables, floor - everything was dirty... furniture is not old, it's like prehistorical... 

Overall verdict: if you want to eat average burger you can drop in at this place but don't expect something really nice. And if you would like bison burger - WBurger will be your choice as it not far from this place, at College."}
{"text":"Bareburger is the definitive organic burger experience. What I appreciate most about this place is its overall lack of pretentiousness usually associated with a self-declared non-GMO organic restaurant. Personally, I don't care whether my food is organic or not from the perspective of healthy--I just like how much better it tastes. And Bareburger delivers.

Their salads aren't pruned to perfection, instead having a raw look to them which is exactly what you expect from organic greens. Each ingredient is packed with flavour and the dressings perfectly match the contents. We had the kale and spinach which was delicious.

Apparently, onions can have exceptional flavour. As such, I must recommend the onion rings which are sweet and crisp. The fries are also incredible. And finally, a house made ketchup that doesn't taste bad! Quite the opposite of the usual expectation here, with a taste that is slightly smokey-sweet, a bit spicy, and reminiscent of San Marzano style tomatoes.

And finally, the burgers. Wow. Impeccable buns, perfect non-greasy patties, lean healthy ingredients.. what's not to love here? The only time I've had a similar burger was at Alley Burger in Calgary, who sourced all their ingredients (beef, bacon, cheese curds, vegetables) from nearby Calgary farms. Very similar tastes here. You will leave full, but not feeling gross.

Can't recommend it enough. Go here! We went on a Thursday afternoon. It was quiet in there. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I'm not a big meat eater and I stay away from dessert but the wild boar burger was wonderful and the caramel Sammie was the most flavorful caramel. Worth breaking my usual habits!  I sat at the bar. Service was pleasant and prompt."}
{"text":"Bareburger specializes in organic & all-natural burgers. On their menu, you can choose from burgers with pre-set ingredients, or you can create-your-own burger. However, the create-your-own option seems to be a more expensive option if you choose the more premium ingredients. They have great service here, the staff were super knowledgeable about the menu. My friend opted for the Country Fair and I had the Supreme burger. Their burgers are super juicy and packed with flavour. We literally had juices dripping everywhere, a mess to eat, but DELICIOUS! The onion rings on the Supreme burger had a nice crunch to it, but it was super dry. Salivating just thinking about how good this burger was! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Has that unusual look and feel to it, the heavy wood table with chairs is crazy, waitress (Eden)was upbeat. Cheerly, and friendly. Big plus in service so far I give it a plus for non traditonal burger meat like elk and bison

First my milkshake came , a chocolate peanut butter combo. So good, so thick, it was unbelievable

I order the supereme, swap beef for elk and man was it good, thick patty, the fruit wood and bacon was new too me but still crispy, add the cheese and onion rings and I'm in heaven

My side was onion rings, ( I know there were some in burger) the batter was good and interesting

A definitely a return is in my future

Only issue was price,  I ended up paying 30 plus with tax and tip

If I got just a burger still might be paying 17,18 which is a bit much for a burger"}
{"text":"Oh my God, finally an organic burger place with gluten free, vegan options, dope atmosphere, and great service. I'm so happy this place exists."}
{"text":"I ordered the quinoa burger with a side of sweet fries. I really appreciate the fact that some menu items are labeled \"v\" for vegan, I hope more restaurants would do that. Burger size is smaller than what I'm used to, but it was very filling. Sweet fries are really delicious. They do serve alcoholic drinks here.

Overall great place to grab a vegan burger."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times mainly for their sweet potato fries and \"special\" sauce.

What I ordered:
1. Chick n pickle: 8/10. This was pretty good except a little expensive 
2. Sweet potato fries with special sauce: 10/10. I crave this everyday. There is a really great balance between the sweet fries and the somewhat salty sauce. I would recommend this to share!
3. Backyard brisket mini burgers: 6/10. I found these just ok. Personally not my favorite but I can see how others would like it very much. 
4. Hot chicken n pickle mini burgers: 8/10. I found this oddly appetizing as I don't normally like spicy food. I wound recommend this to others."}
{"text":"Having eaten at the NYC Bareburger I expected similar goodness. Uh uh. I ordered some type of game meat that had NO distinction whatsoever from ordinary beef. This was an expenisve very boring and tasteless meal with very ordinary fries. Expensive and dull, perfect for Toronto."}
{"text":"Eden was fantastic. 
Great food! Great service! Great selection of meats, and a veggie if that is your thing. 
Elk, turkey, bison, beef, chicken, duck, wild boar, veggie, brisket.  All organic and locally sourced."}
{"text":"StaffService A+, Food A+, Air Quality (yes!!) F-

Had lunch today and brought a friend to Bareburger who had never been to this restaurant.  To my embarrassment, the ventilation system in the restaurant was clearly 'underperforming'.

My only comparison would be to that of what you expect at \"Korean\" style BBQ restaurants.  Restaurants where you cook your own meat over the fire at your table.  But at least you're prepared to leave these types of establishments with the smell of food infused in your clothing.

That was not what I wanted my friend and myself to experience today Bareburger.  The air quality did not improve as we had our meals and as soon as we finished eating, we didn't linger, paid and left.

I did speak with the staff when we arrived and the response to my air quality question, was perhaps it was from Breakfast?  The staff member didn't smell the bad air quality my friend and I were experiencing.  Am thinking, working in the environment staff have gone 'nose blind'.

Sadly, I don't know if I'll ever go back to Bareburger."}
{"text":"Maybe a bit harsh because I didn't try their burgers but I had enough of an experience to not want to go back.
Stopped in for takeout, just wanted to try their ice cream sandwiches and onion rings. Waited about 25 minutes to get what I would think would be ready made ice cream sandwiches and onion rings that take 3 minutes in the fryer. The place was packed with hipsters but $25 later for 2 small ice cream sandwiches and an order of rings I'm done. I would think that if we dined in and had 3 burgers with fries and drinks I'm looking at $80 or so. 
Not happening because I would feel guilty cheating on Burgers Priest knowing that I've never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"No matter how hard I try to fall out of love with burgers&fries, I can't do it. I keep coming back to seek out another juicy treat! I decided to try out Bareburger because it is new, looked cool, and I like their fresh approach to using quality ingredients.

I love this place!

The ambience is modern in that cozy cabin way. It is not at all stark inside, and the dim lighting makes everyone look good. I also did NOT notice an overwhelming sense of hipster, so that was a definite plus for me. There is a neon sign about ukeleles on the wall that is a bit 'trying too hard' for my taste, but aside from that, I do like the decor. The way the interior is set up is also very pleasant. Having a bar and bar-seating is great too.

The service was amazing. Everyone was friendly and clean looking. 

I got one of the popular burgers - I can't remember the name, started with an S. It was on a Brioche bun that tasted like Heaven. SOOO good. 

Fries were great too. Nice and salty. The size of the fries was normal size - NOT shoe-string like Earls fries, and not at all wedges. They were the diameter of Swiss Chalet fries, but longer in length. Usually I like just slightly thinner fries, but these just tasted so good I ate them in like 1 minute.

I really wished that I ordered a shake. Next time!

So go check this place out! It's great!"}
{"text":"The portion was small but it was the best buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever had. 
UPDATED 
will never order fried chicken from here again. They clearly ran out and used chicken tenders instead on the sandwich. It sucked. Tell the customer if you're going to do that, so i can order something else. The burgers are pretty good."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food.  The quality is surpassed only by the variety.  It's not easy to find grass fed and free range meats.  The salad I had with organic vegetables and and egg was incredible.  Who thinks to put a sunny side up egg on a salad?! Delicious! Would absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Bareburger makes burgers other than your traditional beef patty-they have elk, bison, pork to name a few. It's a good place to go if you want good portion of meat in your burger and the onion rings are massive! It's a bit heavy but it'll keep you full.  Great place to hit up before a show/game at the Rogers/Air Canada Centre. You can see the kitchen through their open concept space, so there's a chance you'll smell like fried food if you're sitting close to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Had the Bison burger with lots of veggies and GF bun plus sweet potato fries. It was divine. The only issue was that it was a lot food for one sitting and impossible to not eat all at once:)"}
{"text":"I might return another time, I went on a Thursday late August for lunch.  It wasn't bad, took over an hour to get served for lunch and we had to wolf down the food and leave to get back to the office for a meeting. 

I would avoid this place if in a hurry but I may try again if I have a longer lunch time, or maybe for dinner.  

This place has all the elements of a good restaurant/gourmet burger place, but clearly haven't figured out how to manage being busy which I guess is a good problem for them to have."}
{"text":"Ordered  the Matador, the Buckaroo, and sriracha crisp Brussel sprouts. 

Matador was ordered medium rare, but was completely dry and well done. 

I asked for medium for my Buckaroo, but they could only do medium well for beef. Turned out well done and dry as well.

Nothing crispy about the crisp Brussels sprouts. Overall everything was generally way over cooked and lackluster."}
{"text":"I actually didn't get a burger the time I went. My friend did and she said it was amazing, I had a bite and it surely was. I had a chicken sandwich, which had a burger look to it anyway. The only downside about this place is that you do not get sides with your burger or sandwich. Otherwise, loved it and will probably come back again. Service was nice and ordering was easy. Not a long wait time either."}
{"text":"Visited here on a trip. I can't wait til they come to Chicago. Even though I didn't have anyone to dine with on my birthday, at least I had a very happy tummy. I love how the burger was cut up and greens rolled around it. Genius!  I had the elk and highly recommend it!  Make sure to try a cocktail to wash it down. I love pasture raised, non gmo food so this was a slice of heaven!  They even had my phone waiting for me when I came back for it!!!"}
{"text":"Came with a party of 7 (with reservations) Friday evening - the place was quite full when we got there but actually seemed to empty out fairly quickly after an hour or so. It wasn't even that late! Maybe take this into consideration if you prefer a quieter dinner/drinks affair, rather than having to raise your voice to have a conversation. 

Food: 

I had the Wiki Wiki (wild boar, duck bacon, pineapple relish, gouda, chickpea onions on brioche), and shared some onion rings, fries, and sweet potato fries. I also had a peanut butter, chocolate and banana milkshake! Although the burger seemed a bit small at first glance (the plate looked large in comparison), it was pretty filling and I enjoyed it, especially the pineapple relish; the sweetness lent well to the savoury boar. I didn't think the boar patty was too special; I actually didn't think it was juicy enough. The fries were pretty good, a bit average in my opinion. However, I LOOOOVED the onion rings - they were large and crispy. So. Good. 

The shareable plates (which we ordered from) also comes with some house made dipping sauces: ginger ketchup, chipotle mayo, jalapeno mayo (maybe, can't remember), and barbeque. Keep in mind that if you order fries/rings from the \"sides\" section, you won't get dipping sauces - dipping sauces only come from the shareables section. The milkshake was decent - not excellent, but far from poor. It was creamy and still had chunks of banana in it (reassuring), but I would've preferred a thicker shake. What I liked was the option to mix as many flavours as you wanted into one milkshake!

Service:

Service was excellent. Our waitress, seeing as we were a large party, automatically assumed that everyone would pay separately (she assumed correct). She also offered to split our shareables (fries, rings) equally amongst us. +1000 points to her. What I also liked was how she recommended the shareables to us, rather than leaving us to order our sides separately - it saved us money, and we also got to try their house sauces! The waitress was also very attentive to us, and refilled our water bottles frequently. The bussing staff were also efficient at taking away our used plates. 

TLDR: would totally come back; would've given 5 stars if the prices weren't so steep!"}
{"text":"This is a great place with an interesting organic menu, delicious food, friendly service and a modern vibe. I shared a side of onion rings that everyone seems to love and they were great. As unique as it sounds, a vanilla peanut butter milkshake was good. And most importantly, the burgers: I had the Blue Elk and my sister had an El Matador burger. They were a great size - not too big. I found that El Matador got sloppy because of the guacamole but it still tasted heavenly. Over all, it is a cozy experience with high quality food."}
{"text":"I had walked past this restaurant so many times before and finally decided to try it out. I loved the idea of organic and all-natural burgers, and the fact that there are locations all over America got me excited. I had the buttermilk buffalo chicken burger, which was nothing memorable. Maybe next time I'll customize my own burger because this signature combo wasn't that great. Also ordered some sweet potato fries ($8), which was, again, nothing special.

The location is great - just steps from Dundas Station, and the whole interior decor is very rustic. I love the concept of customizable, organic, GMO-free food at a decent price. I just wish the first thing I see on their menu online isn't a live chicken staring at me....it's the only sort of meat I eat and it makes me feel uneasy."}
{"text":"My meal included; the supreme, a side of onion rings and sweet fries (sweet potato fries) and a steam whistle.

The burger was delicious! It was topped with two onion rings and loaded with savory flavors. The onion rings were also delicious (cooked perfectly) but the sweet fries were soggy. I was disappointed with limited beer selection; however, they did have steam whistle!

I would probably rate Bareburger a 4 star but the cost of meal for one person was roughly $27 which makes this a $$$ in my opinion.

It's important to remember that they are serving free range, humanely raised, antibiotic, gluten free and hormone free meat. This and the cost of leasing a  commercial space in Toronto makes this an expensive meal which could probably be less than $20.00.

Definitely worth a try if you enjoy a good burger!"}
{"text":"We were just walking by at lunchtime on a Saturday when we decided to try Bareburger. While we didn't want a burger, we saw that there were brunch and sandwich options as well.

We were promptly seated (good thing we arrived when we did, because the place got progressively busier), and wait staff immediately brought water and menus, and explained the options thoroughly (if you do order a burger you can change up buns, toppings etc. to suit). 

 I opted for the duck french toast and my partner decided on the poached eggs with kale and multigrain toast, although he wasn't sure that at $7.95 (coffee and fresh orange juice included with all brunch items), that it would be filling enough. He was wrong, and pronounced the dish delicious. 

The duck french toast on multigrain bread consisted of a fried egg, duck bacon, colby cheese and plum jam with a side cup of maple syrup. Delicious! Worth every calorie ;-)

Bareburger uses organic and locally sourced ingredients when they can. The decor is recycled barn boards and tin roofing, perfect for the casual atmosphere. The wait staff is attentive and knowledgable but not annoyingly faux-friendly or familiar with patrons. 

There also seems to be a good selection of local craft beers, and the burgers and onion rings (huge things!) that went by looked good as well, so we'll be back to try those in the future."}
{"text":"You know elk wasn't my favorite.  I actually really didn't like it.  The meat was still very red too.  And I asked the waiter and he said it isn't as popular but still good.  Guess that could be the same about any other burger.

Starters:
The 100 year old pickles, however, were really good.  It comes with three huge jars of pickles each with a different flavor.  One of em was a touch on the spicy side for me, but still very enjoyable.

Onion rings were also very good.  They give you different sauces to try along with the rings.  I bet the fries would be just as good too.

Would have given it more stars but you come for the main and not the side!  But I will definitely give this place another try.  Next time beef!"}
{"text":"I was looking for neat place to grab a bite. Bareburger is a really nice and unique place you shouldn't miss while in Toronto area. Super menu to build your own burger or choose own from the menu. Different meats like elk and bison are available as well. Nice staff, great organic food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good. 

I ordered the supreme burger and rings/fries.  The burger was very good - loved the toppings (bacon, cheese, onion rings, fries, excellent burger sauce) and the bun was great, not too soft.  

I loved all of the sauces you got to dip the fries/rings.  The onion rings were the best I've ever had (they were like A&W rings but not as greasy or salty - they were perfectly crisp and I even yelled at my 4 year old when he tried to take one off of my plate, ha ha).  I also had a couple of moscow mules, one of my fave drinks.  I thought they were quite tasty, but a bit expensive, considering the size and amount of alcohol.  

The fries were very disappointing.  I think they were frozen?  Gross.  It's actually pretty bad when all you are doing is burgers and fries and the fries are that bad.  The sweet potato fries were very good (stole one from my friend).

Service was welcoming and helpful.  Loved the decor.  The tables were a bit of a tight fit, so you are really close to the neighbouring tables."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something 'different' from the usual plethora of same-o burger joints in the city. Bareburger, on paper, seem to be worth a try. 

Dropped by for lunch service. We opted for the Hog Wild burger (wild boar) and the Elk burger. Both meats were cooked well but still retained some of their flavour.  Size (portion) of the meat is generous - about 5oz cooked?  Great bun,  just the right thickness and density to hold everything together without feeling like your eating more bread than ingredients. 
Also had the rings and fries combo. Rings were fantastic. Otoh, fries were so-so and on the soggy side. Both came with a nice selection of homemade dips.

Server was friendly and helpful. Service A+.  Overall decor pleasant, establishment clean. 

All in all good food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Service is pretty good and the burgers are simple and delicious. If you're expecting a fast and cheap burger this is not your spot.  It's got a good vibe, but you have to wait.

Elk and blue cheese were amazing but so are your simple classic beef, lettuce and tomato cheeseburgers. The best part is there is so much variety in more exotic and gamey meats too."}
{"text":"It was a spontaneous stop as we were just deciding what to eat for dinner around the area. I knew about its presence on Dundas st. W, but I never really heard much about this place prior to dining here. So I didn't have any expectations going into this place.

Good ambience, friendly service, and unique concept. It is a bit pricey as you are getting local and organic ingredients... Their onion rings were massive and thick! Just the way I like it :) They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I liked onion rings more than I did for my burger. I got a boar burger with fried egg inside. 
My first impression: what a tiny burger
Taste: OK nothing memorable or special about it

Overall, pricey and small portions (not a good thing when you want to have a hearty burger), but convenient location, good ambience, and friendly service. 
I give this place 3/5 mainly based on the taste of the food and its value for the price. I have had better burgers near this area at a lower price."}
{"text":"Very happy with Bareburger. Had the Hog Wild burger which has wild boar and a fried egg. Sooooo good. I'm putting this place as my 2nd best burger joint in Toronto, behind Burger's Priest.

Had a great taste, texture, sauce and was very filling.

The one issue I had was my burger came to just over $13 which is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"It is absolutely the best in town, even better than the Burger Priest.  We ordered The Standard and Buckaroo.  They both came in with brioche buns and the beef patty were moist and soft with a lot of flavor.  The specialty milkshakes were awesome, the combination of banana and caramel mixed very well and was not heavy.  Bareburger definitely offer the best burgers in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. I really like the choice you have for buns, and they are really nice as well. The burgers are organic free-run and all that healthy stuff, so people on paleo diet like me could appreciate this more. The patties are not so greasy but juicy nonetheless.

The place is kinda noisy on weekends, i guess that's expected of a place like this in downtown. Seating arrangement and service is good. In all, the environment is OK, i guess I prefer quiet places.

So, great food, OK environment, heart of downtown, not-so-expensive burgers.

It's worth a try if you are in downtown, or a burger lover."}
{"text":"My sidekick & I were starving after a few hours milling around at the Eaton Centre (just around the corner) - so we stopped into Bareburger. 
There is so much to choose from - duck/turkey/elk/wild boar/chicken & that's just to name a few..... You can build your own burger or try their flavour combinations. All the sandwiches are between $10 - $14 but that doesn't include sides. 
I ordered the Hot & Honey chicken - which was pretty good, the slaw on top was a little tasteless but the chicken & bun were spot on. It was probably my mistake to order a chicken sandwich at a restaurant with 'burger' in the name (won't make that mistake again). 
My sidekick got the Buckaroo burger & WOW it was amazing!!!! I'm not even a meat-on-meat person but it was delicious - it's bbq-y, cheesy, topped with sliced brisket. Delish.
We also split onion rings which were HUGE and beyond tasty but my ankles were swollen for 2 days after from the salt (worth it!). 
We were both stuffed - and satisfied. 
Staff was super friendly. 
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you like your burgers organic and non-GMO and all that conscious food jazz, come to Bareburger. If not, still, come here because their burgers are friggin' jawbreakers!

Well, oh fine: you pay quite a bit more to feed these Yankee hipster hippies' cause for using conscious ingredients, and not every burger produced comes stacked over half a foot tall, especially if you choose from preprogrammed options. But how many places are there in Toronto where you can get a bison patty, or elk, or wild boar?

The greasy appearance of a Bareburger burger immediately washes away any thought of fluffy happy cows on the pasture. You can create your own burger from an organized list of stuff, and if you're me and go crazy with everything, you'll probably end up with a skyscraper of a burger that struggles to fit in a mouth as humanly possible. I find that surprising for a place like this--and just as surprising how quickly my order arrived. My own bison burger concoction was juicy and a carpet bomb of flavours and textures--alfalfa absolutely works well as a burger topping (as does blue cheese as always). 

Service was generally pleasant, detailing how their build-your-own option works. One thing they failed to tell me and comes as a pleasant billing surprise: weekday $6 draughts and wine happy hour until 7. You're very welcome.

{TTC: To reach Dundas at Bay you shall take the 505 or 6 routes.}"}
{"text":"Tried their elk burger. It was nothing special. The bun and vegetables were fresh, but the burger itself was not so good. Most likely because the meat patty had been frozen. Nothing can beat a never-frozen meat patty. The service was really good and they have a very good beer selection, including some craft beers. The meat of the business, however, the burgers are nothing to rave about. Unlikely that I would go there again."}
{"text":"Food was decent. They serve bison, elk, boar, and beef (no, really, they do.) burgers. I took the hog wild burger and it was pretty good. I loved the burger, but felt the meat patty was kind of small compared to the rest of the burger. Note, that the price is $10-15 ish bucks per burger and does not include fries ($3.95). Portion size was almost perfect (needs more meat), and I disliked the bun. It fell apart mid-meal. The fries were done very well and I enjoyed them a lot. They were crispy and I'm afraid I spoiled the fries a bit myself by thinking I needed more salt without actually trying the fries on their own. Burger went down really quickly.

The service was very good, attentive and came fairly quickly. 

Overall, it was very good, I would come back again and try the other burgers."}
{"text":"I LOVE this burger joint! However from now on I will regard it as burger fine dining. I got the Standard with Bison, poutine and a chocolate shake and was very happy with my order. Food was delivered fast and still hot, the service was very good. More so I have been thinking about their food since I left.  

I HIGHLY recommend Bareburger I'm cutting this review short to go get one. 

Bon appetite guys"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. A+ burger... And I am a person who doesn't really like meat! The burger I got (elk) was juicy, moist and had a delicious sauce on it. Thinking about it now I can honestly say that it was the best burger I ever ate in my entire life. It really was that good. Also, the staff was very accommodating and professional. They couldn't seat our very large party because it was so busy, but instead they allowed us to do takeout. They offered suggestions and even made sure we all had a glass of water while we waited. This small gesture showed me that staff was very attentive and genuinely cared about their customers! Great job, I am a fan and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Lil on the expensive side. Exciting meats like bison and elk. Everything's organic. Even the water apparently, lol."}
{"text":"Burgers, salad bowls and sweet fries were delish!! However, the wham bam chicken was half okay cause the rice and veggies beneath were sour as if it wasnt cooked properly - but the waitress shrugged it off therefore service was decent."}
{"text":"In one word: Meh.

The food was only okay. I got the Grindhouse burger and shareable fries and rings. Burger meat was a bit dry, but still tasty. The sauces that came with the fries were very good. In our group, more good things were said about their delicious mustard than their burgers. The ice cream sandwich was good, but nothing special.

The waiter we had was very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant shortly after it opened and then again a week ago. The food is great, but it is a bit pricey. Is it worth it? I say yes, but with some reservations.

I tried the beef burger both times and while I first thought it was a big small, they do not scrimp on the toppings! I shared a basket of fries with a friend the first time and sweet potato fries the second. The onion rings, which came on my burger, are also a must-do. I have a healthy appetite and had skipped breakfast but I found the portion size to be more than adequate, despite my initial reservations. You can't judge a book by its cover!

The ingredients are top notch and I love Bareburger's approach and belief in organic, non-GMO, etc. You won't find Heinz on the table - even the condiments fit their philosophy.

The restaurant itself is a fabulous space with all sorts of reused building materials and efficient, eco-friendly options. There are even little plaques throughout the restaurant describing features or lauding the benefits of organic, non-GMO meat in case you want a bit more information.

In terms of cost: this is a bit above the \"fast casual\" burger joints in Toronto. You're looking at close to $20 for a burger and a side, but you are paying for the quality of the ingredients and the eco-friendly philosophy. I have had no problem with the value proposition here but I do consider it to be a bit of treat and wouldn't be a weekly visitor.

Drink prices are high but the options are all craft: craft beer, craft pop, etc. A beer, a burger and a side could run you close to $30 by the time all tax is included. Substitute a pop instead and you're looking at $25. I have yet to try a milkshake but after reading the other reviews on here I definitely need to!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the series of gourmet burger restaurants that have opened up in the past year, and Bareburger is a nice addition to the mix. They heavily emphasize the \"organic\" aspect of their menu items, and the interior even feels organic.

I personally prefer lettuce burgers over a regular burger because I don't like how the the part of the bread that touches the condiments becomes a little bit soggy in a normal burger. I checked the menu beforehand and saw that they had a collard green option for anyone that wants a bun-less burger.

The one thing I appreciated was that their burgers weren't all beef. They had a variety of different meat options, such as bison, boar, and elk, and even have a fully vegan burger option. I also liked that even though they so have a build-it-yourself option, they still provided a series of burgers that were put together by the restaurants themselves. It's just hard to know sometimes what goes good with what in what combination, so I like having the choice of picking something without the fuss of choosing every single detail. If you want to be picky though, you can do that too.

I got the Wiki Wiki burger and while visually the burger wasn't all that appealing, the burger was juicy, flavourful, and full of different textures in each bite. The collard green option turns the burger into more of a vegetable wrap, but it did make the entire thing easier to eat. Personally though, I still would have preferred a lettuce bun option. I thought that the vegetable wrap was a bit too thin for the thickness of the meat, and there wasn't much of a crunch from the vegetables that you would typically get from a lettuce burger.

Despite the minor qualm though, I would be happy to return in the future. The burgers aren't cheap (~$15), but that seems to be the going rate for gourmet burgers. It definitely did taste gourmet to me, so I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"Waiting for the burger but tried the strawberry milkshake with the Vanilla base and it did not disappoint. More to follow.."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the few negative reviews.  I came here regretting my choice after seeing some of the negative reviews but i was pleasantly surprised.

The staff are pretty friendly.  My server may have appeared a slight flippant but he may have just been distracted, otherwise he and especially the host were quite friendly. The restaurant was clean and with nice decor.  Smart layout.

The food... wow... the burger was surprisingly delicious.  It appeared small when served, but i had to be rolled out of there.  The patties are actually quite thick and the sandwich appears to be packed with premium ingredients.  You can tell each burger was made with love.  A fresh brioche bun, loads of avocado, delicious premium cut AND organic meat.  They have several selection of meats to choose from, off the top of my head, turkey, duck, bison, wild boar, elk. We had El Matador.
Other delicious side items were the poutine, fries and onion rings... mmmm...poutine...  and the berry soda, which was very good as well.
The peanut butter banana vanilla milk shake was also very good... :)

The only sad part was the bill at the end.  The place is a bit pricey, but it makes sense, since a good cut of meat is expensive, and a good cut of organic meat is ridiculously expensive.  They do use a healthy portion of premium ingredients in their burgers.  I can't imagine being able to make such a good burger at a lower price.  I do hope to return again to try one of the other burger and milk shake choices."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like burgers? They can accommodate almost any diet (even if you don't like burgers, you will shortly) and offer a variety of all-natural food. Burgers are one of my favourite things to eat, but going paleo is a bit hard (who wants to eat the patty without the bun?!). 

I got the El Matador ($13.95):
Bison cheese curds (!!!), pickled jalapenos, guacomole (!!! x2), green leaves, and I got it inside collard greens instead of the bun. I don't know any other restaurant that accommodates wheat-free options except this (maybe they can try almond flour buns? Or am I being really ambitious/picky/annoying?). They don't skimp on the meat, and the guacamole is just beautiful. I guess the one thing is they could put more jalapenos, but I'm already hungry thinking about the burger again. 

Sweet potato fries + onion rings ($6.70) were also ordered. They were great as they are, but you're also given a variety of sauces if you like to live more on the flavorful side. 

The staff is extremely friendly and are attentive (it was packed when I was there, and there was always someone to help you). The decor of the restaurant is great, especially the tables by the window. 

I guess the one thing is that it is a bit more on the pricey end, but you are getting all-natural food that's more than delicious. Would definitely come here again with friends."}
{"text":"Lots of great different options and at a reasonable price! The staff were very friendly and you just get an overall fun vibe!"}
{"text":"Came by on a Saturday night with my husband and had the supreme burger. The burger was amazing as were the onion rings and the organic ketchup was awesome. The fries were a little too soft for my liking. Service is good. 

Would definitely come back and recommend it."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  

Came in on a Monday evening, after 7.30p, the place was about 70% occupied.  
Waited for someone to seat me and took up a spot.  Was given a menu and water came to the table quickly.  

Since it was my first time there, I had to try to decipher the menu... basically it's this, choose your meat (pay for that), choose your bun, choose cheese (pay for that), choose bacon (pay for that), choose your toppings (pay for that), choose your sauce (pay for that).  Oh, want fries, pay for that too.

I waited for the server to come back to me.... and waited... and waited some more.  I noticed that there were 2 servers and obviously they were busy.  No one working the bar so hence the servers had to draw all the drinks themselves.  I also noticed, because I had oodles of time, that there were a number of other people waiting, either for their food, or to pay.

After what seemed like a longer than it should be to prepare a burger and fries wait.  My burger and fries arrived.  

Hmmmm... my fries were not piping hot, instead they were just warm.  ok, even though I had a heap of them... I would have thought they'd be a little warmer.  My first bite into my burger and...  Let me go off on a bit of a rant here.... I've said this before and I'll say it again, if you have the name of burger as part of the name of your restaurant, then to me, that should be your thing you do the best !  Don't get me started on Taco Bell.  But anyway,  you'd think that the burger is the signature thing you do... your core competency !  Ok, rant over... the first bite, and... dry bun, guacamole squishes out the side, and burger is dry and overcooked.   The Burger was also definitely well done, not medium as the menu said they cook all their burgers medium.   I look and the guac that is now on my plate instead of inside the burger, and it looks likes it's aged... and not like a fine cheddar.  Ya, you know how Guac turns colour, this was definitely not fresh, and I'm guessing not made today.  Also, who puts green peppers in Guac ??  Seriously ??  

I was starving, so I ate everything, however once the server finally returned back to ask how the meal was I was nearly done.  I told her it was ok, but basically lied.  

Once I was ready to get outta there and again, just like the food.  I had to wait.  When I say I'm ready to pay and I show you my credit card... you'd think you would bring the machine with the bill, Nope.  

Overall, I've had much better burgers for much less.  Remember earlier when I said you \"pay for that\"... Add, add, add, and I'm up to a $16, over cooked, dry bun, green pepper filled guac that squishes out of my burger, burger !  Sorry Bareburger, I was really hopeful you'd be my go to burger place, but I can't do it. With a combo of below average food and not very good service,  I'm going to keep looking for my go to burger place."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Bareburger! The decor has a homey-cottage feel to it. Very cutesy, the logo for Bareburger is also very cute.

Service was excellent - our waitress was very friendly and knew the menu inside out. Very helpful for our first visit here!

DRINKS:
Red wine (I forgot which one we ordered)
Strawberry chocolate milkshake

WIKI WIKI burger
(Wild boar, gouda, duck bacon, chickpea, onions, pineapple relish, brioche bun)
SO GOOD :) I loved this one! The meat was juicy & the pineapple relish sauce was very sweet - I'd recommend this burger!

EL MATADOR
(Bison, cheese curds, picked jalapenos, guacamole, green leaf, spicy pico de gallo, brioche bun)
My boyfriend wanted something more on the spicy end but unfortunately, it wasn't that spicy.

+ SIDES (Onion rings & sweet potato fries)
Loved the onion rings! Usually when you eat the onion ring you will accidentally pull out the whole onion within the batter - and i did, but there's TWO onion rings within HAHA - I was so happy and impressed LOL"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to catch up with a friend and was seated promptly after we entered the restaurant.  I wasn't too sure what to expect when I walked in -- I've walked by this place a lot while in the area and was wondering about the name.

We got the following:
- Onion rings to share
- a Supreme burger
- a Buckaroo burger (mine)

We totally didn't realize the Supreme came with onion rings, so we ended up with more onion rings than intended (oops).  Everything was good, but I wouldn't say amazing.  The onion rings were huge!  We couldn't finish them at all and had to take it to go.

I would come back but the food didn't completely wow me but maybe next time I'll try building my own burger instead."}
{"text":"Right out of the gates Bareburger meats start off as free range pasture raised, humanely raised anitbiotic gluten free and hormone free. That's pretty awesome to start and you can't argue with that, my friends.

So for me, the only thing left is flavour and doneness. All their red meats are cooked medium well so if you have a preference, let them know.  Medium guarantees that nasty e.coli is gone but for me the flavour is better at medium rare.  I do prefer to try any burger made according to their standard because I assume that they take that into account into making the burger taste incredible.

That being said, on a rainy day I decided to give this place a whirl. Starving, I walked in and was immediately greeted by a hostess. I admit, I wasn't expecting that for a burger joint.  Sitting by the window, enjoying the view, I ordered The Standard and a chocolate banana milkshake.

Service was prompt and friendly. Let me say this, everyone here is super friendly. Way to go on customer service.

 On the table you'll find their house made ketchup and spicy mustard.  GIve it a whirl! It's tasty.

First up was my milkshake. When you order a milkshake there are free add ons you can throw in.  It's inputed promptly into their ipad as you order.  I had to order a shake because I read quite a few reviews on how good it was. MY GOD!!!! It was incredible.  I can't recommend it enough.  Beats any milkshake I have had. HAd one at Burgers Priest and completely disappointed. THey made theirs with chocolate milk and ice cream. IT fell flat right away.  This milkshake had real chocolate in it.....and bananas. Heaven. That's where my 4 stars sits.

'The Standard' burger was definitely overshadowed by it. Not my favourite.  The patty itself was a little too done for me. It tasted a little dry. MY preference is medium rare but I'm all good with something else as long as the flavours are there. Composed of beef, colby, stout onions, dill pickles, special sauce and a brioche bun.  It just did not come together enough for me. I was picking at the components as I ate to remove parts to make it taste better. Perhaps, next time I'll try something with my doneness and a different combination. 

Again, so much of about this place is good and it's obviously successful in many places.  I would try it again but modify my choices."}
{"text":"I rarely leave reviews but after my recent (first and last) experience, I felt compelled.

We went in on a Sunday around 9pm to get some takeout and waited by the counter for at least 15 minutes before anyone took our order. Multiple staff members walked by us and it was pretty clear they noticed us waiting, but still nothing. The guy who finally took our order stood chatting / joking around with a table for at least ten minutes before acknowledging us.

I looked back and noticed that the couple who had come in just after us were standing waiting to be seated for 15 minutes as well. There were tons of open tables and tons of waiters waking around doing nothing, but the couple was completely ignored. They looked pissed and finally left.

After they finally took our order, we waited for 30 minutes for our food. I noticed the chefs in the kitchen joking around. One was just standing there the entire time talking to the other chefs.

We finally got our food after one hour total in that place. We also ordered a large milkshake but they gave us a small. We were not willing to wait for another milkshake because it took them a long time just to get the original milkshake, so we left without telling them.

In terms of the food itself, the fries were pretty good (it's hard to mess up fries). The burgers were extremely plain tasting and dry. So not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Organic ingredients are a thing of the future and this place does just that.

Bareburgers' concept is about organic ingredients, locally grown and produced, and fair trade. This is all in the lovely reading material that is provided on the table. 

Our server was very informative and gave a lot of suggestions on the menu without me having to ask. Always bonus points for this. 

In terms of food, I have to give this place a 3. The food prep concept is really cool and I trust the ingredients are from where they said are, but the taste itself did not live up to expectations. Here's why: 

Nacho fries: the ingredients blended in nicely and I liked it when I first ate it. It reminded me of nachos, but with fries. However, you can't wait too long to finish it because it will completely turn soggy. Personally I don't like soggy fries. The flavouring was also a bit weak. I had to use ketchup to add some flavour.

Wiki wiki burger - the pineapple relish sauce was very original. I like the sweet mixed with sour. Our server recommended that we got this on the side so it doesn't make our sandwich soggy. Good tip. We did just that and noticed the sandwich did get soggy closer to the end when I was finishing it. The actual patty didn't have much taste. However, I can tell the burger was prepared freshly and ingredients were fresh. The bun is very soft! 

Chicken burger - the chicken had a sweet sauce and it came with the pineapple sauce. The pineapple sauce overpowered the chicken sauce. It is spicy so beware. The sandwich turned soggy in the end. 

Rosemary lemonade - very different. I liked it. 

Milkshake - tasted like apple pie. Delish! 

Overall, this place is a noteworthy 3. However I can see their potential if they add more flavour to the patty and perhaps, change the bun so it's not as soggy. Service was good. I really liked our server!"}
{"text":"Nice burger spot with fun vibes. Staff are very friendly and upbeat. The large variety of meat options is great and you can try burgers with some unique flavours/meats like bison, boar, elk, duck, etc. I had the County Fair with juicy bison meat and aged cheddar. Would definitely recommend for a nice lunch or quick dinner."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a good burger, which I got, however they can't seem to get the kids burger right, after two tries, the burger was still raw and pink in the middle. Not good - I had to explain what E. coli was to my 8 year old. Server insisted that the cook checked the burger with a thermometer, maybe buddy needs a new thermometer."}
{"text":"I am not a burger person. I thought the only burger joints I liked were shake shack I'm NYC, or burger priest but I was so pleasantly blown away with the burgers here. Their patties are amazing. I don't mind the gamey taste to lamb, and I thought the elk and venison would have been gamey but they weren't.  So juicy and tasty, cooked to perfection.

 They have a build your own burger option but that ends up being far more expensive than the original burgers they offer on the menu. The burgers are always packed with amazing sauces like spicy mayo mixed with roasted red peppers... 
 
I also love love their lemonade - the rosemary limeade had the perfect balance of the aroma and taste of the rosemary in the limeade. They even gave me a second glass o the house when it was my first time there! 

The only reason I took away a star - if I could take away 0.5 of a star, I would have done that instead of the full star - is because service is slow. It took around 30-45 minutes to get our food out of the several times that I have been here. If I'm not in a hurry, I would definitely come here!!!"}
{"text":"Great burger joint..cool place, very pleasant staff. It's a good organic restaurant for all health conscious peeps. They have organic beer as well!! Fries is tasty and came with a curry sauce and a special sauce which tastes pretty good. We had the EL Matador burger which is from a BISON'S meat, topped with Cheese curds, pickled jalapeño, spicy pico de gallo, guacamole, and brioche bun= heavenly tasty!! If you like exotic meat like from the Elk, Wild boar, bison, duck, turkey, ect..this is the perfect place!!"}
{"text":"We only had dessert based on a review a blogger posted about how amazing the snicker doodle ice cream sandwich was.
 The ice cream inside definitely was delicious but the cookie portion was just ok, heavily infused with cinnamon. If you love cinnamon a ton, you'd probably love the cookie... I just found the cinnamon overwhelmed the yummy ice cream a little... Also it's pretty pricey for an ice cream sandwich"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Really made sure my food didn't contain things I'm allergic to. Food is out of this world! We will come back each time we visit Toronto.  Make sure to save room for a milkshake!!"}
{"text":"Ate here recently with friends and really enjoyed it. All organic, natural ingredients and a big variety to choose from. There's something for everyone, even multiple vegan/vegetarian patty options, and we all thought the food was great!"}
{"text":"The narrative being sold at this chain: organic, all-'natural', healthy burgers -- menu is peppered with buzzwords like 'free-range', 'gluten-free', 'hormone-free', 'non-GMO', 'sustainable', etc.

So, if you're down with that narrative and willing to pay more for it, more power to you.

However, if you judge the food alone -- it's very pricey for the quality and portion.  I paid $18 (before tax and tip) for my Fire Quacker (duck patty, habanero mayo, pepper jack, pickled jalapeños, red onions, spinach and tomato on brioche) and a side of onion rings.  The onion rings were really good but the burger overall was just 'alright' - patty was a tad dry and grainy and far too much bun for the patty (though I did have it done medium-well as default - maybe getting it medium would have been better).  The toppings were well selected though and worked great.

Even though I consider the gluten-free and anti-GMO fad as silly and anti-science, I realize that with the quality-sourced ingredients the price point has to be higher.  But I'm not sure if the efforts really make that big of a difference on a burger.  

For what it's worth, the space is nice and the service was excellent.  The joint is licensed and I get the angle they are going for, but I wish it was self-serve counter style - maybe that would get it closer my pricing sweet spot.  But for about $24 all-in for burger and a side (no drink) - probably won't be heading back."}
{"text":"Going downhill. We come here every couplr of months and loved it at first . Past couple visits disappointing....portion size ridiculously small .... My husband and I floored at how skimpy they've become on burger size for price . The hostesses becoming ruder with awful hipster 'tudes BIG TIME. That's such a turn off . Servers still remain good and professional. Just poor value for money with diminishing portions"}
{"text":"Rushed here after a Raptor's game, hoping to get our orders in before they close. Got in just in time. Ordered a Blue Elk Burger, Grindhouse Burger and a half fries-half onion ring basket to share. The waitress suggested this was the most cost efficient way. Thanks for the tip!

The burgers were both elk meat and it was my first time trying it. So maybe it was just due to it being elk, but I found both burgers a little dry. The toppings on each individual burger came together nicely, but each could have maybe used a bit more sauce. The fries were pretty regular, but the onion rings were very yummy. They were large and crunchy. It also came with four different dips: a flavoured BBQ, flavoured ketchup, an aioli and something else I can't recall. It was fun to keep cycling through them."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by Bareburger as they offer various game meat burgers. I also had high expectations and loved how they used organic items and cook their meat on more of a medium-well than a well-done. 

We had a bison and beef burger and to our surprise, it was very lean even though the meat was thick it wasn't as juicy as we would expect it to be. A little disappointed.

However, their natural root beer soda was really good..."}
{"text":"Went here two days ago on our last night in Toronto to find out they are closing next Friday so I'm not sure how much this weight this review will hold so I'll keep it short.

I ordered the turkey burger which was a little on the dry side. Wasn't bad but again wasn't rememberable either. Onion rings were good, fries ok, homemade sauces not rememberable either. Not a bad last meal, but deff had better burgers that lived up to its yelp hype."}
{"text":"A'ight. I came here for brunch on a Saturday, so I am basing my review on said experience of amazingness. The place is bright and cozy, servers are super attentive and friendly. Menu is full of options and interesting items without being overwhelming. I will definitely be returning at some point to try one of their burgers.

Because we were here for brunch, I ordered the duck duck French toast. The name refers to the fact that there is delicious duck bacon featured in this dish. This has hands down become my holy grail French toast, no questions asked. Just TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. It's the perfect amount of sweet and savoury, moist and delicious, and the portion size is just right. Brunch comes with a complimentary juice (apple or orange, not from concentrate) and coffee or tea.

We also ordered the onion rings and sweet fries to share. Sweet fries were standard, onion rings were REALLY GOOD. They also give you four dipping sauces to try. They're all fairly tasty, but their smoke sauce is definitely the best. Could drink that stuff out of the bottle. I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"great staff.. nice looking stablishment. the burgers are good.. better than most if you are willing to pay for a $15 burger no fries  no drink...   the ingredients are good in quality, but at that cost at least make it more quantity... i got the buckaroo (beef patty, old cheddar, brisket, mushroom), didnt feel me up...  but it taste good, not amazing but since its sooooo organic i guess you are not getting all the bad stuff they put in other places that makes their burgers so tasty."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, great beer selection and friendly staff. I forgot my keys in my booth the night before and I returned the following day and a guy brought me in the back handed me a coffee and found my keys for me. too high for what you get.This place is great! Food is awesome. Beer menu is huge if a little pricey. And you can rent a locker for your favorite beer stein. Win!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for adventurous burger lovers... but it also has good selection of gluten free and vegan options! All ingredients are organic, non GMO, which matters to us. To top it all, they have great service, cool interior design, and relaxed atmosphere. Great eatery for a quick lunch or dinner... come and check them out."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Our server was super nice and informative. Onion rings and fries came with 4 unique dipping sauces (ginger ketchup, bbq, jalapeño, etc) - so good!!! I got the guacamole veggie burger. I did not enjoy it - not enough flavour for me. Probably because I'm just used to salty unhealthy burgers. All in all it was a nice experience. I'll try a real burger next time."}
{"text":"I enjoy the premise of Bare Burger but can't overlook the poor service I've received there. Drinks were slow, food was slow, fries were cold, I had to ask for napkins, and no water refills were offered. What a shame."}
{"text":"Would have given this place 4 stars if the service was better. Would have given it 5 stars if the service was better and the burgers were bigger. I have switched to eating only grass fed beef so I was delighted to see this place while visiting Toronto. One suggestion, offer a larger burger at a higher price point or have smaller buns. I feel cheated if my burger is smaller than the bun and I have to lift the bun up to find the meat. I understand the higher cost for the business but offer a larger oz burger, I would definitely pay more to be satisfied."}
{"text":"If I had known how magnificent their chocolate milkshakes are, I would've came in to eat a burger, but so so stuffed.

I say it is Top 3 for a non-malted milkshake.

great atmosphere. And Gorgeous service too.

Amex good."}
{"text":"I had a wiki wiki burger  wild boar with duck bacon, gouda, pineapple relish on a brioche bun. It came with tax to $14.97. It was certainly not worth it. My pineapple relish was so cold, it was almost frozen. The brioche became quickly very soggy that I needed a fork to finish it. Everything was blah. Too expensive for nothing. Not coming back even though the service was incredible."}
{"text":"My pal and I went for a massage at Elmwood Spa on Saturday night, which is why I was in the Bay/Dundas area. I had read about this American burger joint and had bookmarked it because I read a lot of good reviews. 

Bareburger really highlights the fact that they use local, organic products - not an original concept, but more power to them for promoting a good cause. The decor is minimalistic; it looks like you're in a lodge with wooden tables and chairs. At around eight on Saturday night, it was crowded, but we managed to get a table. I found service to be excellent - our server was extremely personable, entertaining, and attentive. She came around to our table often to see how we were doing.

I enjoyed our meal here and would recommend what we had - build your own burger with a sprout bun, Thornbury cider, and a 'bareable' portion of onion rings/fries/sweet potato fries.

Couple of pointers:
* Sprout bun is better than the brioche bun imho 
* Onion rings and sweet potato fries are good; the fries are good, but not as good as the other two 

Good for: burgers, drinks"}
{"text":"Service was amazing, staff extremely friendly and welcoming and the waitress went over the whole menu with us.  

I got the Farmstead burger which was more of a wrap, but tasted a lot better than I expected by the way it looks. Also got the Supreme burger which was loaded with onion rings and fries. 

The prices are a little more expensive but you pay for the quality and the restaurant itself had a charming vibe than your regular sit-down burger-shack like the Works or BQM. Overall, I enjoy the fact that all of their products are organic and all natural and have a lot of options for vegetarian and gluten-free meals."}
{"text":"They've changed their menus a few times since it opened but I still enjoy their burgers, be it bison or turkey. That typically is enjoyed with frings (get it as a side to share) and a hard day's float (sub cream soda). I do miss their poutine and don't understand why it's off the menu. Service has been great and our server was super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, it is really hard to find a place with good burgers. My Experience  at Bareburger was amazing! From friendly service to delicious and very filling food. Would love to try the other vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Best burger in toronto hands down!!!!! The quality of the meat and the ingredients they used are amazing, it's a bit pricy here but ur getting a good quality burger that sure filled me up...I got the supreme burger as recommended by our server, had onion rings, fries, cheese, lettuce and bacon in it with 2 onion rings attached on top of the burger 

They say all their ingredients are organic and such, who knows how true it is but all I can say is try this place....they have a great atmosphere as well, everything is wooden from tables to chairs, service was fantastic.."}
{"text":"The blue elk is one must-have! I also enjoyed the onions rings, which were really huge! The server is especially helpful. I give five stars for the whole experience."}
{"text":"Great food - amazing selection for vegetarians, gluten intolerant, carnivores, etcetc. Something for everyone. The portions are huge!!! And decently priced. The only issue I had was my jacket reeked of fried food when I left (I didnt have any fried food - just a salad). Next time I will order takeout."}
{"text":"Good variety of burger options and toppings. The food fresh and fast, as well as friendly reliable service. Homemade ketchup and mustard makes the burgers even better then most places. FYI super duper vegan and gluten free friendly. Only negative that might lead to a 4star review is that the sides are pricey.  Sides like fries and rings are close $5 on the side of your premium quality burger. Bring an appetite and your wallet. Big plus goes to the unsweetened iced tea (US style), only place I can find in the city. Will always comeback here! Look forward to future locations!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  The burgers are fantastic, the onion rings were among the best I've ever had and the sirracha brussell sprouts were a pleasant surprise!  The carrot cake was out of this world! Olivia took great care of us and helped with menu selections.  The very customized burger I ordered was pretty pricey, but the taste, service and atmosphere made it worth it.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Note: If you casually order the \"middle-sized\" beer like I did, you'll be greeted with a comically-oversized glass mug filled with beery goodness. So make sure you order the middle-sized beer (or higher), seeing as beer, hamburger, and fries pair wonderfully. And in this case, while it may sound a bit over-indulgent, the journey won't leave you feeling regretful when it's over, because the ingredients are real and it's all delicious. I'd say this was one of my all-time favorite meals."}
{"text":"LOVED our burgers. They have GF buns available and everything is organic. 

Prices are fair and flavours are delish!

Service is super friendly and accommodating. 

Interior is rustic chic and super comfy. They also have free wifi. I'll definitely use this as my go to place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of many things at Bareburger, but the one thing I do love (the Buttermilk Buffalo) I order almost every time I go. It is very pricy, however, and given that the prices have gone up even more within the past year, I don't think I'll be visiting very often anymore. Good experience for those interested in new burgers!"}
{"text":"Bison burger was outstanding.  I added the habanero mayo and back bacon.  Great atmosphere.  Finished with a shake."}
{"text":"Where do I start? The atmosphere when you first walk in is excellent, I sat at the bar and was served immediately with a cocktail of my choice. The menu is very well laid out and easy to follow. Lots of fresh choices and something for everyone, even the non meat eating friends."}
{"text":"I really hope they re-open.  My wife and I would go there almost every Sunday.  The burgers were awesome!  It is the only place in Toronto that has organic burgers."}
{"text":"Went into Bareburger this past weekend, trying to find a place in the downtown core, with space and a TV with the All Star Game! 

Overall really great place. I'm a huge fan of gourmet burgers and Bareburger didn't disappoint :) All of the burgers are customizable and the ingredients are organic! We tried the Supreme and the Grindhouse- which I highly recommend.

Service was A+ and the place itself was cozy and adorably decorated. 
Only downside is it's a bit pricey. Our burgers were about $14 -and sides were an extra $4-6."}
{"text":"Are you a...

Hipbilly?

Hillyster?

Hiphilly?

Essentially, if you are any combination of hipster, hippy or hillybilly you may like this place.

Hipster- There are craft beer, frequent line-ups and waiters with beards and man buns.

Hippy-  Good karma comes with organic meat, no-GMO and all that crap.

Hillbilly-  You can get duck, wild boar, elk and bison in a burger.  The floors are made with recycled wood and the roof with old barn panels.

The food?- I had the blue elk which had amish blue, back bacon and tomato fig jam all on a sprout bun.  The meat was cooked perfectly but the taste was hidden a bit by the bun and jam. The fries were great and the onion rings even better. Try the Sir Kensington's ketchup....it was to die for.

The drink?- Homemade soda and ice tea (the latter was delicious) for those not up for a potent potable.

The price?-  Good luck getting a \"combo\" for under $20 which happens to be the same price as a fancy hipster cocktail served by a guy wearing a tie or an official duck commander quack pack duck call."}
{"text":"I did research on food stops before my visit to Toronto and this was one of the \"musts\"...and boy am I happy I did!! The service was fantastic. Our server (who may have also been the owner)"}
{"text":"We came in and was suprised about the crazy amounts of selection of burgers and the customization involved with each part of the burger. Naturally we asked for a recommendation and went with it. We chose the wiki wiki burger and the el matador burger. The wiki wiki burger was sweet and filled with meat flavour from the bison. It was magnifique. The el matador was not as great but still pretty decent. We also ordered nacho fries which was too much for the two of us. We were so full that it became an obstacle to not waste food. In the end we got takeout for the nacho fries. 
We bought milkshakes. Peanut butter milkshake is pretty nasty but the vanilla was superb. 
Servers were all really friendly, and they do try their own menu, so its not empty recommendations. 
Would definitely pig out here again!"}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner on a weekday with my friend after work. There were many tables empty as it was pretty early. This was our first time here so we were shown the menu, given a brief explanation, and even a few suggestions of popular items. 

The interior of this restaurant is very casual and has a great ambiance. It's good for groups and a nice place to enjoy food and catch up with friends. 

The service was okay overall. Nothing amazing but not bad either.

They have some vegan options, which is why I came in. I had the Guadeloupe burger, which is a black bean burger with a sprout bun and delicious sounding toppings such as guacamole. I wanted to switch a topping (which was stated that they could change and customize the burgers as we were given the menu) for something in that same category (same price) but they said I would have to pay extra. That was extremely disappointing. I ordered it as is with the pickled onions on the side, mostly because I didn't know what they would taste like and I hate raw onions as it is. When the burger arrived, the onions on the side looked just like regular onions and tasted like regular onions. There was nothing different about them to call them \"pickled\" so I was glad I ordered them on the side. The bun was pretty good. It tasted fresh. The burger patty was very mushy and tasteless. I have had many black beans burgers and this one was probably the worst. It needs flavour. It also fell apart very easily. I don't particularly like salt and often find things too salty but this patty was in serious need of salt. Coming from me, that just shows how much flavour it lacked. I ended up drowning the entire burger in hot sauce to be able to eat it. 

This place might be better for regular burgers with meat but if you offer vegan options, at least make them half decent. I wouldn't come here again or recommend it to anyone who is vegan, or vegetarian with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing service! 
I sat at the bar, the bartender was so helpful on helping my choose a burger as it was my first time here. Later I found out it was the end of her shift. It blew my mind she was willing to take time to help me even tho she was leaving. The next bartender came along and introduced herself immediately after and was just as friendly. 
There is also a happy hour on beer and wine. I didn't get the times. 
Burger you can get it made your way. I got The Standard medium well. Two thumbs up
I rarely give 5 stars. This place defiantly deserves it!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for some time...and I wasn't disappointed. We had the Grindhouse and Supreme burger (recommended by the waitress) and they were amazing. The burgers weren't greasy and they weren't dry...delicious! The restaurant was nice and clean and the waitress we had was super nice.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"all the burgers i've had here have been excellent. they're not big, but they're a good size for me. the onion rings are also very good. 

as others have mentioned, the price is higher than other burger places. however, it's a sit-down place with service and it's licensed."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I were downtown Toronto for just the weekend and we swung in here for lunch before we left. We had the Big Bear Caesar, which had just the right amount of spice. Then he had the Grindhouse burger, I had the buttermilk Buffalo, and we split the frickles (fried pickles). Everything was great! Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I had the bison burger with guacamole. It was very tasty and juicy. My husband had a beef burger and it too was very good. The ketchup tasted funny but I think that is because I'm not used to organic ketchup! We had a great meal. 

Service= great, fast and the waitress put in our orders on her mini iphone right at the tableside! Super cool."}
{"text":"The service was good!!! Food was absolutely superb!! I ordered supreme burger. It was heaven. Savor every tiny bit of it. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Bareburger is very family friendly (if you go at the down times). Their collard green wrap is a great gluten-free alternative; My husband often orders it just because he likes the taste (although he says their buns are pretty perfect). Their pickle plate is a good starter, and the Be My Burger is an excellent option for those who have allergies. Hands down, they have the best sweet potato fries in Toronto.

The only thing that might deter folks is that the food takes time. It's not the service that's slow (they are all helpful and considerate, for the most part), it's just that the kitchen is kind of glacial. So, if you're eating in or doing take out, expect to wait in West Coast time."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overrated and inedible burger.

My friend wanted to treat me to belated birthday dinner, and since I was craving a burger, I chose Bareburger on the basis of the great reviews on Yelp. 

When we arrived on a Sunday evening, the place was about 60% full. We were quickly seated and given a menu with water. The menu seemed interesting, and pricey...it felt like one of those -\"you build your own combo vibe\" and you pay for each item individually - not much of a deal there!

My friend loves hot dogs, so she was happy to learn that adults could order from the \"Cubby Fare (aka, children's menu).\"

What she ordered: 

Koala which consisted of a beef hot dog, and for sides she got a salad and a box of apple juice. She also ordered a milkshake 12oz for $5.95.

What I ordered: 

I ordered the Buttermilk Buffalo sandwich for $10.90 and I also got a  milkshake 12oz for $5.95. 

To share: 

She loves onions rings (I hate onions), and I love sweet potato fries. So, to get what we each liked, we got Ring & Sweet Fries for $10.95. 

Verdict:

Massive disappointment....

Shakes were chuncky, watery, and lacking flavor. I ordered the peanut butter, banana and chocolate shake, and there were chunks of peanut butter, little banana flavor, and it tasted like they used powdered chocolate. Probably the worst shake I have ever had. 

The burger was plain nasty. It was all bread, with a small super-salty piece of chicken, and a lot of BBQ sauce (or \"buffalo sauce), and it was impossible to finish without a gallon of water (I barely managed to eat half). We also left most of the salad (lettuce and tomato with a couple of slivers of cucumber), and the hot dog not only tasted crap, it also looked like crap. I asked if they had any condiments for the hot dog since they serve it to you without anything, and only then did they note that they can bring out some condiments if my friend wanted any. Why couldn't they ask her what she wanted on her hot dog when they took the order is beyond me. 

Overall this was a disastrous meal - probably falls in top 5 worse meals I have had in Toronto. 

All this for a grand total of $54.72!!!!! I felt so incredibly guilty for choosing this restaurant, specially when I have built a reputation for choosing good places to eat. On a positive note, I think I will create a blog post for the worst food I have had in Toronto - so these experiences will not feel like a complete waste of money and time. 

**The only reason I am adding a second star is because our waitress was in fact nice.

P.S. I just noticed that the owners do read these comments, yet they pick and choose the ones they address. Personally, that says a lot to me. You either address them all, or none at all."}
{"text":"Came out with the family to this place and it is very happening. It was at capacity on the Friday evening that we were there. Atmosphere: There is that woody/cabin type feel to the place which is popular these days. Service: The staff is young and very happy to serve. Our service was great. They do have a high chair! Food: We ordered a milkshake, the veggie and some fries and you can definitely taste the quality in the food. The prices are a little higher, but you are getting what you pay for. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Based in New York and opening 3 more soon. Giacomo the manager was really nice.

Take out experience - friendly service and nice ambience while I waited for food.  They have veggie style entrees for those that want a burger but their significant other is a vegetarian. 

County fair burger was pretty awesome and came with fresh toppings and lots of sauce.  The fries and onion rings were pretty tasty too!

Would come back to dine in or take out."}
{"text":"Burger was ok & service wasn't. I felt invisible & ignored. Maybe because I was a single visible minority female??? I don't know. They showed me to a table. I left my stuff, went to the bathroom & came back. Had to wait over 5 mins & make eye contact with a server. I felt everyone else got better service than me. No ine checked on me to see how the food was. They got the smiles & please come backs. Only reason I stayed was because I was hungry. Ordered a beef burger wrapped in a collard leaf with spicy sauce & guacamole. Thin beef patty & it didn't taste special. I rarely leave zero tips but I did this time. I can get a better lettuce wrapped burger elsewhere."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 4/5 fun, friendly, nice vibe. Love the concept of organic and locally sourced/ home grown produce with no hormones in my meats. Also, great variety on menu.

Service: 5/5 awesome and friendly, attentive and prompt. They work as a team. 

Drinks: 5/5 decent price, good selection

Food: 4/5 
-Macho fries are like the adult version of a Taco Bell fries supreme. 
-Grind house burger was delicious, but not a fan of the sweet relish. (Maybe ask for it on the side if you don't like sweet or relish in your burger, but the elk meat was fantastic). 
-County Fair burger was simple but flavourful. A lot juicer meat patty than the Grind house, possible because of the fat content in the beef as opposed to the leaner elk meat.

All in all, a little pricey, but you're getting quality meat here. I would return to try their infamous onion rings."}
{"text":"I have had Bareburger bookmarked on Yelp for awhile now and finally got to experience how wonderful it is! 

To begin with, the service is incredible! Our server, Eden was so friendly and accommodating, and gave us a great run down of the menu and her recommendations. 

My friends and I split an order of sweet potato fries and regular fries and they were both delicious! They each come with two different dips which complemented them nicely. 

My favourite part of the meal was the Guadalupe burger, which was a black bean patty, spinach, tomatoes, sprouts and guacamole on a sprout bun. Best veggie burger ever, and I've tried many! So flavourful! 

Overall, it was definitely a delicious and satisfying meal and you can feel good knowing that Bareburger uses only fresh, organic ingredients without any preservatives :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I were greeted by a friendly hostess who showed us to our seats upon entry. The environment and decor was very unique and wooden, they had a lot of eye-appealing decorations throughout the restaurant. 

I admire how their food items are natural and how they aim for healthy-eating and healthy ingredients. I ordered their Supreme Burger and Sweet Fries. Their sweet fries were pretty good and the sauces which came with the Sweet Fries really did enhance the taste of them. Also, they provide each table with their own unique ketchup which also tasted pretty good with the Sweet Fries. I regret not ordering extra sauce in my Supreme Burger because I felt as if the taste was lacking, it was alright though; the quality of the ingredients were definitely there. The onion rings which came with my Supreme Burger were pretty good too, especially with their unique ketchup. 

Overall, the Sweet Fries was pretty good and maybe I'll come back to try out another burger."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends. Ate before I came so I made room for dessert. Tried their ice cream cookie sandwich. Yummy but a little sweet, still would def recommend it."}
{"text":"A group of friends wanted to meet up for a movie and dinner. Originally, the restaurant suggested was on Danforth whilst the movie screening was going to happen downtown. It would be a hassle to go from point A to B. I suggested Bareburger because it was a newly opened restaurant that I saw on BlogTO and it was much closer to the theater.

Bareburger is a pleasant restaurant with a modern take on the cabin theme. They emphasize on \"all Bareburger meats are free-range, pasture raised, humanely raised, antibiotic, gluten-free, and hormone-free\". This is great if these points are important to you when buying meat.

I scanned through the menu to realize that none of the burgers came with fries or some sort of side. I was not happy that I had to pay $11.85 for a burger that wasn't big and had no sides. Had I done my research beforehand, I wouldn't have chose to come here. That's just the penny-pincher inside of me huffing and puffing. The burger was decent, but it didn't stand out tremendously either. I understood where the price point was coming from, but still, no fries with that??

If you don't mind paying premium for organic burgers with no sides, then try out Bareburger."}
{"text":"Great burger place! Came here with the family and we all enjoyed our food. I ordered the elk burger and hubby got the wild boar. We shared an order of poutine. Everything was delicious. Our waiter was great. He was knowledgable about the beers and helped my hubby choose one that he loved. Pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"I was impressed by Bareburger's selection of different meats. I had the Grindhouse and the elk had subtle differences to beef burgers. The brioche bun was pretty good too. I definitely want to go back and try the boar and bison. Though it's cool to try different game meats, it's extra hard to taste them with all the toppings (i.e. are you sure it's not beef?). Still delicious though.

However, if you go you should stick to the burgers. I had a Tom Collins cocktail and it was pretty disappointing (super watery, very little alcohol, and quite expensive for a place like this...$13). They had half-off cocktails that day but the waitress didn't tell me that the one I picked wasn't part of the promo, despite being on the same part of the menu and having JUST talked about the promo. Found out when I got the bill, which made the substandard drink even more disappointing. Go for the burgers."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious organic fare. The veggie sweet potato patty is so good, crispy and tasty. We shared a pickle appetizer and fries. The pickles and coleslaw were pretty good but I wouldn't get them again. I'd recommend the French fries, perfectly crispy. 

Server was a bit awkward but otherwise decent service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been waiting for Bareburger to open and finally they did. We walked over to grab a bite for lunch, and the staff are very friendly and interior design of the place is very cozy.

My husband ordered their \"Buttermilk Buffalo\" for our waitress highly recommended it for it's her favourite sandwich. The sandwich came and it l looked pretty good, but my husband find that the batter for the chicken was a bit too salty. Overall he wasn't blown away by his sandwich.

I ordered their \"Standard Burger\" and added a side of \"Rings and Sweet Fries.\"
I really enjoyed my burger, it was juicy and full of flavour. I'm usually not a brioche fan, but I really like their brioche bun with flaxseeds. As for the \"rings and sweet fries,\" the sweet potatoes were good, but the rings were a bit overcooked and too dense for my liking. I couldn't even taste the onion, defeats the purpose of having onion rings.

All in all, I would go back to try out more of their burgers, but I'll be skipping the rings and fries for next time."}
{"text":"Twice in a row it took more than 30 minutes to serve 3 burgers, sure the food is solid but if you don't have more than 2 hours to waste on a meal then don't come here"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!! Try the sweet fries....and build your own burger anyway you like!

I loved the bison burger :)"}
{"text":"A very interesting menu with very contrasting burger offerings. The place definitely has a very hipster feel and the staff seem very friendly. The food was decent but did not live up to its price tag, especially with the portion size. I might be bothered to come back to give it another go with a friend (the menu has me curious), but while it wasn't a negative experience, it wasn't particularly memorable one either."}
{"text":"This place serves just great burgers! They let you build your own burger which is a lot of fun (as you would assume, you end up with a ridiculously big yummy burger).

Very friendly staff that were payed very good attention to allergies and made sure the food we ordered was fine. 

In all, a very good dinner experience in from all points of view. 

Recommended!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend, hoping to be able to eat something before I had class in an hour. I ordered a Be My Burger, beef patty on a brioche bun, with pimento cheese and all the toppings and sauces that were not extra charge. It came at around 10 minutes after I ordered and this was during the time there were only 1 or 2 tables empty. The burger itself was interesting as I have never had bean sprouts in a hamburger before. It was okay but it didn't \"WOW\" me. I would come back to try their other burgers though!

PS. I did make it on time haha!"}
{"text":"The naked truth is that Bareburger is easily one of my top five favourite places to get a hamburger meal in the GTA. The dining experience here is comfortable, casual, and truly satisfying.

Service is friendly here and the staff here are always welcoming and attentive. The cabin-like feel of the fairly large dining makes for the right ambience while you wait to fulfill your meat or vegan cravings. 

There's seating room at the bar for solo diners who prefer the bartender's company. This Bay & Dundas location attracts many tourists and passers by, who seem to enjoy the atmosphere and the food selection in equal doses.

Must-try items:

Supreme Burger
The Standard Burger
Buckaroo Burger
Any milkshake

The price points of some menu items might raise a few eyebrows, but the end result is worth it in my opinion. For roughly $18-24, you can get yourself a top notch burger, side order (fried, onion rings etc.) and a drink or shake. Most of the options on the menu come topped with premium toppings with no extra charge.

With an emphasis on organic ingredients, a wider range of choices in patties, and the sourcing of local produce and meats, they've really distinguished themselves as an upscale, gourmet establishment. As a result, the higher than average prices are well justified. This place isn't for average burger eaters; Bareburger is best suited for the true fanatic who enjoys a classic sit-down experience."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to bareburger for a while because I heard that they offered responsibly sourced meat and the food is made from fresh, organic produce.

I dragged my friends here and was very excited to try theor food. I really had their black bean burger called Guadalupe, which is vegan.  I had high hopes for the burger but sadly was left disappointed. The bean patty lacked flavour all together . It was very plain, just mushed up black beans. One of my least favourite veggie burgers that I've ever tried.

My friends tried the bison burger and 'the standard' and they really liked it. The burgers weren't very greasy and tasted clean. 

The sweet potato fries were very good! It takes a while for them to get the food to you, but that's probably because they prepare everything fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy food! The continuing saturation of the \"experience burger\" in Toronto, with so many establishments offering similarly decadent, belt-busting menus, has left the city's burger fans adrift in a homogeneous sea of sanctimoniously prepared ground beef. Which I think is part of the reason that Bareburger gets low marks from some reviewers who are hoping for larger portion size for their buck. That's not what Bareburger is about, though. It's not the latest incarnation of Burger's Priest/Hero Burger/Rude Boy, and I think if you go in with those expectations, you'll be disappointed.

Bareburger's emphasis is on top-quality, organic, non-GMO, etc., etc. ingredients. This is naturally going to up the price point and, in connection with that, affect portions. They offer various sandwiches, salads, and all types of vegan, gluten-free alternatives for burgers, including a few different bun options (collard green wrap, for example), vegan cheese, etc. Of course, they also have plenty of meat and the usual between-the-bun suspects (bacon, fried eggs, duck fat, etc.), but it's all about as organic/ethically produced as it gets. 

Bareburger has complete nutritional information on their website, including a user interface to calculate custom orders, so if you care to count your macros, you can.

The ambiance is low-key with a side of reclaimed wood. You don't feel like you're in a cafeteria or anything and the decor is nice, but it definitely gives off the vibe that your meal might not last longer than an hour.

Entrees:
Fiance, a friend and I ordered a sandwich, a burger, and collard-green wrap respectively. We also tried different sides: fries, sweet potato fries, and the wasabi coleslaw. 

As a card-carrying gluten-free cadet, I was happy as a clam with the Farmstead sweet potato and rice patty with cauliflower hummus and wrapped up in the greens. I was delighted with the taste and how filling it was. Would definitely get it again.

The SP fries were hands down some of the best I've had in the city, super crispy and hitting all the right sweet-and-salty notes. Fiance's fries were similarly solid, and our friend's coleslaw was fresh and tasty--although we all commented that the wasabi flavor was there, but lacked the normal heat that accompanies everyone's favorite fiery green condiment. 

Dranks:
They have a good selection of beers, house-made sodas and milkshakes. We stuck to beers.

Service: 
A bit slow, particularly given that it wasn't busy, but friendly and generally attentive.

It's not cheap, with the al a carte burgers coming in at over $10 a piece, but if you're looking for something health-conscious, this is a fantastic place to indulge. I'm definitely going to be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place, but I'm kind of obsessed with it. I'm not even a huge burger eater, and I guess I can be pretty picky about burgers in general (i.e. people rave about Holy Chuck, but I'm not really a fan.) A lot of times my problem is that I dislike burgers that are super oily and greasy - Bareburger gets it just right though, with burgers that are thick and juicy and delicious, but NOT dripping in oil and grease and fat.

The restaurant isn't huge, and being close to Yonge-Dundas square/the Eaton Centre/Ryerson, it gets pretty busy. I came around 12:30 PM on a Friday for lunch, and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for two. I love the interior/decor/concept though; a little bit hipster-y, cabin-looking, with lots of wood furniture and detailing on the walls. 

They have about 14 burger options on the menu, and you can also make your own customized burger by choosing your own patty, bun, bacon, veggies, sauce and spread. I kept it simple for my first visit and picked the Wiki Wiki ($13.25), which is a wild boar patty (!!!), with gouda, duck bacon, chickpea onions, pineapple relish and a brioche bun. The biggest downside to this restaurant is that the burgers don't come with sides, so you have to pay extra for them, and it can get pretty pricey in the end. I ended up getting sweet potato fries ($4.85). 

Once again, the burger was absolutely delicious. A thick, juicy, patty, and the toppings really hit the spot for me - I LOVED that it was a little bit sweet with the pineapple relish, although my co-worker who got the same thing thought it was a little weird. The wild boar just tasted like regular beef to me though. The sweet potato fries were also great, they were a slightly thicker cut and lightly salted, and just soooo good. Bareburger also has this really unique ketchup they use, I think it's all-natural, because it definitely tasted more tomato-y and less sweet than regular ketchup, and I loved it. I tried one of my co-worker's onion rings because they looked amazing, they were HUGE with breading that looked like it had herbs or seasoning on it. Wasn't a huge fan though - they tasted kind of like fish sticks to me, which is not really what I'm looking for when I'm eating onion rings.

Staff was great, friendly, very amicable. Again, if I could take issue with one thing, it would be the price - $20+ for lunch (with no drinks) is a little steep. Also to note that everything is organic, all-natural, and the meats are free-range, pasture raised, humanely raised, antibiotic, gluten and hormone free, which perhaps explains the higher prices. Plenty of gluten-free and vegan options too! I definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"Ever wanted the opportunity to try beef, bison, elk, wild boar, duck, or turkey burger patties under the roof one establishment? This is your place. The walls boast key words like non-GMO, free range meat, no antibiotics, hormone-free, and organic. It's reassuring that this may be the cleanest burger you've probably ever had and also explains why it's pricier than your average burger. Even so, I find that it's worth trying if you haven't been here before.

When seated, the host/hostess usually explains how things work. Following that, you order drinks and it's nice to note that they have a good selection of craft beers. Ask any questions about the menu or for suggestions if you're feeling overwhelmed. I've always found them very helpful.

Their onion rings and sweet potato fries are awesome! Definitely order a plate to share with friends. If you order it on it's own it comes with 4 sauces on the side. If you're a sauce person then you'll enjoy it - otherwise just order them as a side cause it's cheaper.

Now the best part - the burgers! Everyone should get the Supreme because you won't be disappointed. I'll go ahead and deem it as their signature burger. It looks pretty manic as its adorned with onion rings. But don't be alarmed because they are the bomb! I subbed duck bacon instead of bacon and it was super tasty.
Another wholesome burger is the Grind house which has a subtle flavour. They've got so many variations of burgers that I'm sure you can find something that endears to you. If none of their concoctions tickle your fancy, you can even build your own burger.

Things that I've tried but haven't enjoyed are the wasabi carrot slaw (too plain and simply shredded carrots), their banana foster milkshake (too watery), and hot honey chicken (too spicy). For the most part, this place offers a great atmosphere and some awesome food!"}
{"text":"The Supreme and El Matador burgers along with the strawberry milkshake was amazing. Service and ambiance was also amazing. 10/10 would recommend :P"}
{"text":"Bare burger was one of my fav burger points when I was living in NYC. When I saw they have a restaurant in Toronto I was very excited. 

I builder my own burger with blue cheese but when I got my order I couldn't find any bluecheese in it  

The Fries were good, the beers were ok. The waitress was helpful. The place needs more air."}
{"text":"This place is a real treat - fresh, fast, friendly, food and service are both great.  Nearly five stars, just slightly less due to the kids menu not being as kid friendly if the kid wants something other than fries."}
{"text":"Bareburger (@Bareburger) close down for the night on Earth Day to host a media/blogger event, it was so appropriate since they celebrate Earth Day everyday by serving organic and all-natural food in a sustainable environment. They NYC culinary team was also there to talk about how it all started and to guide us through the tasting.

It all started with the idea of making some healthier delicious burger and now they have 24 locations and more to come... yes even in Tokyo.

Onion Rings & Sweet Fries
~ It came with 8 sauces which is pretty cool to try each one of them with the onions rings and sweet potato fries.
~ Love the perfectly golden light well-seasoned batter of the onion ring which tasted amazing just on it's own but better with the sauces. I always wonder how can places find all these perfectly sweet sweet potatoes to make perfect fires?! When I buy mine, some definitely are not as sweet.... I digress, here I find the fries goes so well with the spicier sauces, love the sweet savory spicy combination.

Cali Fresh Salad
~ baby kale, cauliflower hummus, red quinoa, grape tomatoes, watermelon radish, red onion, alfafa sprouts, lemon tahini dressing
~ This was so pretty with all the different color and texture, too pretty to eat but I assure you that it's just as delicious and refreshing.
~ This was actually pretty filling with the hummus and quinoa and can be easily a meal on it's own., so if you plan to have a burger make sure to share this one.

Guapo Chop w/ Buttermilk Fried Chicken
~ little gem lettuce, cheese curds, pickled jalapenos, red onions, pico de gallo, guacamole, blue corn tortilla, avocado basil dressing
~ Yes you have the option to add the Fried Chicken for those who refuse to eat veggies on it's own.

Poutine w/ beef brisket
~ with beef gravy & montreal cheese curds 
~ Of course they need their spin on the poutine being a burger joint in Canada and I have to say it was beyond my expectation.
~ It didn't look as amazing as the other dishes we had so far but the beef brisket here are so so so delicious with ample amount of cheese curds, all I wish is a tad more gravy 

Farmstead Collard Slider
~ sweet potato & wild rice patty, cauliflower hummus, tomatoes, baby kale
This is a great gluten-free option which taste amazing. Here you get the option of choosing your bun for you burger or you can have it wrap in collard green.

Blue Elk
~ tomato-fig jam, amish blue cheese, stout griddled onions
~ Love the strong blue cheese with the tomato-fig jam here, so yummy!
~ But though the elk patty was slightly on the dry side but it was definitely very flavorful (not gamey at all).
~ As the Chef explain, they use Elk because they are very ambitious in foraging and the flavors shows in the meat.

Beef Standard
~ special sauce, stout onions, pickles, Colby cheese
~ Somehow I like the good old beef patty the best, it was so juicy and delicious on that light brioche bun.
~ The burger was served medium rare plus since it's tastier which allow all the juices and fat to be released but fell free to ask for your preference.

El Matador
~ bison, cheese curds, guacamole, pico de gallo, pickled jalapenos, green leaf
~ Somehow I like the bison better than the elk, I find it fattier and less dry.
~ This was the best looking one with all the ingredient peeking out and since I love some heat in my burger, the pickled jalapenos definitely hit the spot
 
Ice Cream Sandwiches
~ I only got to taste the apple pie but would love to taste the Snickerdoodle with the torched marshmallows.
 
Black & White
~ Ended with a creamy of milkshake topped with espresso beans
 
Verdict:
~ Would totally recommend this place, love everything we tried and will be back for more.
~ At an amazing location right at Dundas & Bay right behind Eaton Center, perfect place to pop by after some shopping.
~ Love the gluten-free option"}
{"text":"How did I manage to find myself in the most hipster burger joint ever?

I thought this was a order yourself and seat yourself type of place but nope, it's a sit down restaurant. And they serve alcohol? I was so confused walking into this place. (Having adventure time play on the TV made me feel a bit more at ease)

Anyway +10 points for whoever designed their menu, it's so cute! I love that you can build your own burger with a variety of meat and toppings that also cater to those that are vegan and gluten free. I was too overwhelmed with the choices so I decided to get the Wiki Wiki burger instead with a side of onion rings.

Wiki Wiki burger was amazing - the duck bacon was delicious, loved the little onion rings inside, AND, props to the genius who put pineapples in it too! It was so good and a manageable portion too! Onion rings are also a must here, they felt even bigger than my burger and I struggled to finish them but the onions were huge and batter was great. 

Would love to come back and try one of each meat haha who says everything tastes like chicken?"}
{"text":"Came to Bareburgers with two of my friends, and it was a pleasant experience. The decor is rustic and was very in tune with the theme. They really crammed in the people but we sat at the bar so it was ok. 

I ordered the supreme burger and it was a beauty. What I really like about the place is the different kinds of meat that you could get like bison and other less common meats. My only tiff is that portions are not the biggest, and it doesn't come with fries or a side. We had to order some fries, and without it I don't think we would have been full or felt like a complete meal. 

Service was really great. Everyone was friendly and refilled our water immediately. I would come back here again to be a little more adventurous and try the other burgers."}
{"text":"A friend and I walked by one afternoon and were drawn by the funny chalkboard sign outside, so we decided to meet for dinner there the following Friday. Our server was very friendly and happy to answer any questions we had about the menu -- and we had a lot! The menu has plenty of options and all of the burgers sounded very creative and intriguing (elk? bison? what?). You can build your own or get one of their many signature burgers. I usually like to customize whenever I can, but I wasn't very hungry and the extensive menu was giving me decision paralysis, so I got the hot honey chicken 'wich. It was decent -- chicken was juicy and fried well, but I didn't love the wasabi carrot slaw and the pineapple relish which made the sandwich sweeter (and soggier!) than I would have liked. There was just a little too much going on for me, flavor-wise. I also ordered the rosemary limeade (mostly just out of curiosity) and didn't expect to be a fan...my first sip had a slight medicinal flavor which was slightly off-putting, but I ended up really liking it! The interior is cool and rustic, with fun pops of color from the bear heads mounted on the wall. Their music is also on point! I had a good experience overall, but I just wasn't overly impressed with my meal. If I return (and I might, since it's so close to my office), I'll probably go with what they're known for: burgers."}
{"text":"Juicy burgers, amazing fries and tasty milk shakes! What else do you need in a burger joint.   Oh yes 8 different local brews on draught!  Can go wrong.  Buns can get a little messy but all in all 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Yummy and great service. 

My friend and I came here on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch. We both ordered our own burgers, shared a side of fries and dill pickles, and a small shake each. Yum yum! We were going to order the side of rings and fries, however they ran out of rings - that quickly! We must come back to try the rings! 

The food came out quick, which was great because we both still had to get back to work! 

Overall, not bad, juicy burgers, fresh buns, really filling, a bit on the pricy side, but will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Very yummy burger ! amazing onion rings ... fries where limp and soggy . but our very nice waitress saved the day with bringing out new batch that were hot and very crispy  :) will be back for sure and ask for crispy fries next time ."}
{"text":"l ordered a \"kangaroo\" (totally forgot its name, it was the first thing on the menu) beef burger; with a side of onion ring and fries.  The onion rings are Gorgeous.  The beef burger is the best l've ever had.   And the server was very nice!  10/10 would reccomend."}
{"text":"What an amazing burger place!

First visit I tried the County Fair burger which is bison, and on my second visit I had the fried chicken sandwich with pickles.   Both were fantastic, the buns, the meat, and the toppings were all superb.

Each time we visited our servers were enthusiastic and energetic, it is always nice to go somewhere where the staff actually enjoys their job.  

Would highly recommend this place, get a milkshake, they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!! Stopped in without a reservation and was promptly sat. Had burgers and beers (all organic and gmo free) and loved everything. Recommend this for anyone that is a meat eater."}
{"text":"And back again....I'm going to try all their burgers. That's my mission. They have bison, boar, elk, beef...this is awesome. I have done Southern Caviar, El Matador, and just yesterday the Grindhouse ... Elk burger if memory serves. This place is great, and looks like I'm not alone in my thinking judging by the growing lunch crowd. I'm gonna start coming early to beat the lunch time burger rush. I love these burgers!!!"}
