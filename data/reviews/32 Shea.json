{"text":"Great place to eat and hang out whether it's day or night!  Service is awesome and it has a drive thru too!  They have a great breakfast burrito with a tummy green salsa. The patio has been updated recently so night time dining or happy hour is great. Highly recommend this local spot!"}
{"text":"So, we're moving into the community and thought we'd check out the local restaurants. 32 Shea was one of the first. Started with breakfast, awesome and very attentive baristas. Then moved to dinner, amazing! Really, the food is amazing and better yet, the staff is awesome. Every evening is a surprise with the entree of the moment but one thing for sure, you won't be disappointed. If you like Perfect Manhattans, Josh makes them \"Perfect\". Try this restaurant out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to 32 Shea for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and the occasional coffee pick me up. The food has always been great. The one time there was a problem and I sent back my breakfast sandwich, it was remade quickly and correctly and delivered with an apology. The staff is typically chatty and friendly. I think I have tried most of their bruschettas and they have all been excellent. Salads are good sized, fresh, and delicious. The atmosphere is pleasant and fun. Overall I just enjoy everything about 32 Shea."}
{"text":"I live down the street and never stopped in until today.  I'm still enjoying my Nutella Mocha, and decided it was necessary to contribute to the great reviews!

I'm very impressed with the menu they have for drinks and food for such a small establishment.  I got the New Mexico Burrito and was definitely not disappointed.  I also think the prices are extremely reasonable considering the great quality I experienced.  I've worked as a barista for a chain, and this local spot puts the coffee/espresso drinks I've made to shame!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 32 Shea for some lunch.  The people were friendly . Had the tuna sandwich with green apple  which was quite bland. I really wanted to like this place and may give it another try. The neighborhood needs more unique places like this."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far. Enjoyed two different coffee drinks that were well made and an ok breakfast burrito. The patio has a wonderful atmosphere (that is also dog friendly!). The staff are friendly and welcoming. Great neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my girlfriend. Its awesome. Great food, fun, laid back atmosphere and good prices. What more do you need? This place feels like a boardwalk cafe in San Diego. Succulents on the tables, big safari windows, and the nutella mocha is to die for.  Highly recommended for a Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Love this place - my favorite neighborhood restaurant/bar/coffee--I would have given 5 stars, except it needs to be BIGGER!  Love the food - always fresh.  Cocktails are inventive - even the tea is great!  Still my favorite neighborhood place-- great cocktails and food!  Love the staff and the food!  Brought 8 people here for a luncheon and although small they accommodated us perfectly on the shaded patio."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place - nearby, cute patio, dog-friendly...it had great potential!  But, sadly, they are not accommodating to vegans.  At all.  We went for happy hour and found out that even the hummus had animal products in it.  (yuck)  I asked the server if maybe he could check with the chef to see if there was anything they could do for us. But the server (who was actually very nice) came back with a resounding \"No.\"  Wow.  It has been a while since I've visited a restaurant that would not make ANY effort to accommodate a vegan diet.  Lucky for me, there are plenty of other great bars/restaurants that will happily give me something delicious to eat!"}
{"text":"Every time I come back home to AZ to visit family I stop in at least twice for breakfast and it's amazing every single time. This trip I think I'm up to four visits - not mad about it.

Maybe it's a glaring lack of breakfast burritos on the East Coast that makes me crave the New Mexico burrito, but honestly I think it's the delicious salsa that gets me so hyped.

The coffee is fantastic, the tea is delish, and the atmosphere is a wonderful retreat from the craziness of Shea that lies just beyond the patio.

While you wait for your drinks on a busy morning, watch the well-choreographed dance that takes place at their espresso bar; it's awesome to watch so many great drinks made and the teamwork of the staff shine through in such a small workspace.

Cheers and hats off to the staff and owners of 32 Shea - keep up the great stuff and I can't wait for my next trip home."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while now and we love it every time. Paul is the best and makes the best mimosas! We always get a mimosa and beer when we come. When we wake up early enough, we always get the new mexico burrito with bacon added. The green sauce that come with it is amazing! During lunch, we will get the chicken raspberry salad or the stacked turkey with bacon added. It's a cozy place and they always have fun music playing. I come here hungover to get mimosas and one time I even ordered just a beer with a plate of bacon. The staff is always friendly and go out of their way to make whatever you want!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from here. I've driven by many times but never stopped. I saw 32 Shea featured on FOX 10 AM this morning. The food looked so good I had to try it. I ordered the English Muffin Breakfast Sandwich. It was one of the best Breakfast Sandwiches I have ever eaten. It is also a cute and comfy place to sit and eat have coffee or drinks. I would totally go there again and again."}
{"text":"Very small, but wonderful food and wine. Some of the staff mentioned that they worked previously at Bomberos Cafe & Wine Bar (now Timo's Wine Bar).

The concept of this place is killer."}
{"text":"Hipster joint .....some decent craft beers in a bottle and the pricing is decent on happy hour. I haven't been all that impressed with the food. However, one of the few decent spots in the area so they are always busy."}
{"text":"Three years ago, I checked out the new 32 Shea (named for the corner I've lived near my whole life!), and said I appreciated their presence. Well, three years later, I still do! I stopped in today for a late breakfast and coffee. During the day, I like to do work here-they have outlets and I can sit by the windows overlooking their patio, which gives the illusion of a garden, not a big old intersection!

I ordered the New Mexico Burrito, which was superb! Especially the green salsa on the side. I am also a big fan of their caramel macchiatos.

At night, I am enticed by all their happy hour deals. There's $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta night, and burger and shake night. They keep me informed of these deals on their pretty food photog Instagram page! 

There's also an added summer bonus: it's nice and cool inside at 32 Shea. Something about the indie music, iced beverages, and dark walls. Whether I'm here after a YouFit workout or I've just burned my hand on my car door, stepping into 32 Shea always cools me down. So thanks, 32 Shea. I'm glad you're in the hood."}
{"text":"We always have incredible food and great service here!  Restaurant week was no different - it was excellent.  So good, in fact, I went back a second time.  The first time, I had the Gorgonzola stuffed dates and the Nutella mole braised short ribs on marscapone risotto.  They were both superb.  Very rich and flavorful!  I asked the owner to add the dates to the regular menu!  The ribs were cooked to perfection.  I was stuffed before dessert even came out.  There was a mistake and they brought the Affagado instead of the cheesecake.  Best mistake ever!  I didn't do the drink pairing only because the grapefruit martini (BEST cocktail in town) was not part of the pairing.  I had to be rolled out I was so full (and I'm not a petite guy).

I went back two nights later and had the same dishes because they were so good! Except this time I had the cheesecake, which was great.  

I'm always amazed at what they are able to produce in this little place given how tiny their kitchen is.  The small neighborhood feel and ambiance tops it off.  

Overall, the best restaurant week experience I had this year (and we went out every night)!!!"}
{"text":"The drinks were pretty good; I had the dirty chai. The service, was the worst I've ever received. 

I felt extremely unwelcome and it took 10 minutes to make a couple drinks. During that time, the two people working behind the counter never looked at us and took their sweet time making the drinks. 

We considered leaving several times. 

I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem! I love this place for breakfast, delicious coffee and burritos! Great secluded patio for those cooler days!"}
{"text":"The customer service at 32 Shea has been consistently awful over the past few years. It's disappointing because I really enjoy their food! I typically go through the drive-thru and I always sit there for a few minutes while the three or four staff members who can clearly see me just completely ignore me. The times I've tried to get their attention were a waste. It's interesting how most of their staff has the exact same attitude. Really really weird."}
{"text":"I live a mere mile from 32 Shea, and pass it at least twice a day, every day. I remember when the building was a little coffee shop. Never had a reason to stop in until my gal-friend, who lives on the west side(!), suggested we meet there for dinner. Now... I hang my head in shame. I should have been the one saying \"Oh, you have to try 32 Shea. It's amazing!\" Well, I am now a fan and we plan on going monthly. This will give me the opportunity to try EVERYTHING. 

This visit I had the Roast Beef Sliders. I can't express to you how melt-in-your-mouth moist the beef was, and the wee buns were incredibly soft (I'm sure it's an artisan bread and not just a \"bun\"). And the horseradish spread was delish! We didn't partake in any leaded beverages, but they have a pretty nice selection.

I think the most amazing part of this experience is... you forget you are seated just yards from 32 St. Not an overwhelmingly busy stretch of road, but it does have its fair share of traffic. No matter to me! The strategically placed trees, music and staff divert distract and engage successfully!

The only reason i took off a star is its size, especially indoors. Very \"quaint.\" The outdoor patio is a great location, though, when the weather is kind. 

Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"A long overdue update to say that they actually DO have great $5 glasses of wine for happy hour. They just had different shift staff working the night that I went. Still a cute and casual place for a nice HH chat. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Phoenix! The food is delicious and the staff is always friendly. It's one of those spots where the staff learns your name overtime and you feel like an insider. My favorite brunch dishes are the New Mexico burrito and the Early Bird sandwich. Don't miss the Nutella strawberry muffins! For dinner I like the Turkey Sliders and the Lobster Mac and Cheese. Favorite drinks are the vanilla latte (hot or iced) and the tropical green tea."}
{"text":"This place was a good find!! Great friendly service and awesome espresso martinis!! Small and quaint with a cool patio!"}
{"text":"I visited 32 Shea tonight for some takeout and was pleasantly surprised. The staff was engaging, funny and answered all my questions. I thought it was a good balance of helpfulness without kissing my ass. The food was fantastic (I smashed those sliders) and I'm looking forward to my next visit. Looks like a great atmosphere for a date night away from the kids."}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood spot. Love the patio! Pet friendly. Great go to for any meal of the day, but especially brunch and happy hour. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Been my spot for time now. The vibe is chill with a little bitchiness, but I like it. Lmao. The food is good, staff is genuinely nice and I keep going back."}
{"text":"Thank you for nutella mochas!!!  You changed my life and I think about them all the time.  Had the OMG too and OMG!! I love you for making that too.  It was amazing and so was the chopped salad.  I wish we had more local places like this to enjoy.  We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good and staff was friendly. The only downside is there isn't enough seating and it is a little pricey. The place gets very busy and we actually had to wait for a table even after we got our food lol. But it was worth the wait and we enjoyed the patio seating, beautifully decorated and comfortable."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix from Richmond, VA, found this place on Yelp, and was thoroughly impressed.  The weather was mid seventies so it made for very peasant ambiance with all the windows open.  I ordered a cortado espresso drink and it was great.  Me and my wife got the lox bagel and omg sand which based on previous review recommendations.  This place was nothing short of fantastic! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give these people props for opening a bad ass coffee shop in Central North Phoenix! We met business partners here for a meeting recently and they were just as impressed as we were with the layout of the shop and the coolness of the design! Not only is it a cool place to hang, but they had some wonderful drink mixes and small bites to eat! It was the first time I have ever tried Nutella with coffee \"Mocha w/Nutella\". It was SO good I had 2! The staff was very friendly as well! I will definitely be back to visit soon!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, I went through the drive throw. I asked for a New Mexico burrito with no bacon since I'm vegetarian. I got home and opened my burrito to find bacon and no avocado. I was kinda upset, yet took off the bacon and ate the burrito anyways. It was a good burrito yet I was just disappointed the order was wrong."}
{"text":"32 Shea CATERING: I used 32 Shea to cater an outstanding Breakfast Burrito brunch  for Nurse's week for approximately 45 staff members.  The famous New Mexico Burritos got rave reviews and disappeared in a flash. 32 Shea is locally owned and operated and the owner was so accommodating and efficient that she came in extra early to assemble our order and had it available on time and even earlier than the 6:30 AM pick up requested. The house made  Green Salsa had just enough kick to complement the delicious bite size  egg, potato, cheese, avocado and bacon (optional) burrito platter. They also provided me with their exceptional Coffee- to- Go in a large ready to pour travel container. Next time I will add the outstanding Nutella Mocha Coffee, my personal fav.  32 Shea is a little oasis in the middle of a shopping center with easy parking and access, a lovely patio, and a drive through for those on the go. The owner and staff of 32 Shea are flexible, efficient, exhibit a total \"can do\" attitude, and radiate positivity. The quality of the food and the service cannot be beat for local, fresh, and delicious. They aim to please. I would not hesitate to use them again for all my catering needs for brunches, lunches, or meetings."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. I am a semi-regular for dinner (including last week for Restaurant Week) and I'm always knocked out by Chef T's creativity. Her nightly specials are so good I don't even ask what they are anymore. I just hope there's some left when I get there. The place has a laid back vibe. You can dress or wear a shorts."}
{"text":"ok OMG, First no one came to wait on us for 20 minutes! Then I asked about Happy Hour drinks, a house Vodka Martine was $9 at 4pm on a Saturday at a Coffee House in a Parking Lot at 32nd Street and Shea!!! THEY HAVE A DRIVE THRU FOR GOD SAKES!!! we got up and left and went to the Chinese Restaurant in the same complex 
Little Peking, great food great Plum Wine and no BS! I wonder what the \"House Vodka Martine is when it's not \"HAPPY HOUR\" !!! Talk about over RATED!!! Do not step foot in this DIVE!!!"}
{"text":"Try the muddled blueberry vokda drink!! We went in around 3:30pm on a Saturday and had a wonderful experience. I was so glad there was room for three of us since it's too hot to sit outside now. Our food tasted amazing and our server(they don't usually start serving tables until 4pm) was SUPER friendly. We will definitely be back again..maybe on a Saturday night, just because her service was so amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow, lunch here with friends as we are from Illinois!!!  Had the roast beef sandwich with tea it was GREAT!  We dined outside in the courtyard area, Today it was \"perfect\" for dining outside!!!  Will for sure point  this spot out to our Son and his family!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this spot has a lovely, tree-lined outside patio and delicious food. So why the low rating? Service. We have family who live nearby and visit several times a year, so when we first discovered this place nearly three years ago, everything was fantastic. We felt lucky to find such a great spot. During the last year, year and a half, though, the service has gotten slower and slower and slower. About a year and a half ago, it took 1.5 hours for us to get two glasses of wine, some turkey burger sliders and a mac and cheese. So we didn't go back for a few months. Then we tried it again because as I've said, we love the location, atmosphere, libations and food. This time it was a two-hour wait for simple dishes on a weeknight. So we waited a few more months and went back and, again, a two-hour wait. After a few more months, we tried it again on a recent Wednesday around 6 p.m. and after half an hour of waiting for a server, we left. As we were pulling our car out of the lot, we saw the couple that had been sitting next to us that had sat down a few minutes after we did also walking to their car. 

I would be much more forgiving if this were a one-time problem due to unexpectedly large amounts of diners and not enough servers. But this half an hour (at least) wait to get a server to your table and two-hour long dining experience is nothing new. 

To Management: You've got a gem of a restaurant here. All you need to do is hire an extra wait person or two and this problem will be fixed. Unfortunately, you've lost us as there are lots of other great places nearby. I hope you don't lose even more customers."}
{"text":"My husband and I went out last night to try Aioli Burger at their new brick and mortar location, but when we arrived we could see a big line. Wondering to do about dinner, we turned around and spotted 32 Shea and figured, hey, why not? We are so glad we did! We started off with three kinds of bruschetta, which were nicely balanced in terms of what you get in each bite. One was caprese, one was apples, brie and honey, and one was salami (and I don't remember what else). For dinner I got the lobster mac and cheese and my husband got the braised ribs. The mac and cheese is crazy! So much rich gooey cheese and nice chunks of lobster, incredibly luxe comfort food. The braised ribs melt in your mouth (yeah, I tried 'em, I'm not crazy!) they are so tender and perfect. My husband does not really like polenta at all, which is what came with the braised ribs, but 32 Shea has turned him into a believer and he polished his plate. We were too stuffed for dessert sadly, but you better believe we'll be back. Very friendly staff, showed up at the right moment without being too intrusive.

My only comment for the restaurant is that we were going to sit outside but the seats are pretty hard (just metal). I'd love to see them move into a bigger space somehow!"}
{"text":"If you're never been to 32 Shea, you're missing out. Not only is the mocha the best I've ever had, their tropical green tea is to die for. Seriously. 

Anything you order is sure to leave you wanting more. Try to chopped salad or stacked turkey for a sure win. Having moved away from Phoenix, each time I returned I make sure to visit multiple times to get my fix of 32 Shea. Its the very best."}
{"text":"Really cool little urban coffee beer and wine spot! This part of town is cool but neglected and I'm grateful 32 Shea arrived! The food is tasty, but watch out for the ton of garlic salt they like to use in everything!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool. Food Awesome ,service Awesome , ambiance . This is a must try."}
{"text":"I come to Phoenix to visit a few times a year and this is my favorite stop for morning coffee. Their service is relatively quick and the quality if the drinks is great. It's the perfect stop after a long morning hike in the summer heat. 

Definitely give the lavender latte a try!"}
{"text":"Great lite fare.  Sandwiches, soups, and salads.  My personal favorite is the OMG (a sandwich with prosciutto,  marscapon, and figs.  We've tried several of the sandwich and been very happy with all of them.  

They have a full espresso bar and it the drinks are very good.  I used to own a coffee house, so I'm picky about my espresso.

Service has always been friendly to us and our two dogs who usually accompany us.  We have a Doberman that has excellent restaurant manners and a whippet puppy who has well puppy manners.  

If you come for dinner ask to be seated.  Yes even on the patio and despite the fact you didn't see the sign.  If you don't prepare to be scolded.  Keep perspective and smile.  They are just doing their best to keep everyone happy.  

I really enjoy this place and drop in whenever I'm in the area, which always seems to be with my dogs."}
{"text":"The americano is the best in town.  
A must try is the new Mexico burrito with no cheese and extra avacodo.
The staff is knowledgable and friendly. 
This place rocks for coffee and they have free wifi..."}
{"text":"Always great service.  Love calling in my beverage order and using the drive thru. My favorite is the iced lavender white mocha. Sounds weird but it's worth trying for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hangout! Breakfast yummy in my tummy sandwich is my favorite.  Servers are the right mix of friendly & efficient. Cool to offer coffee in morning and then alcohol in evening. Wish I lived within walking distance to make it my local place.  Drive-thru too!"}
{"text":"Great coffee until today.  My iced vanilla latte didn't taste like the usual, it tasted as though it was just soy milk.   I called later to order another one and rather than just apologizing and giving me a new one, the drive-thru employee had to point out the color of the coffee vs. soy milk in another cup.  Then he proceeded to tell me I should be ordering more than 2 shots of espresso.  I don't think so!  It's the same coffee I order every single time. I'm supportive of small business', however, this will be my last visit. 

The owner for some reason has always been rude to me and her rudeness escalates when the café is busy.  I've tried to look past it all since the café does serve a good latte.   I stopped in one day to inquire about a gift certificate for our school auction in return for FREE advertising to over 300 people.  A simple kind \"no\" would have been sufficient."}
{"text":"I love this little neighborhood cafe/wine bar.  Great HH for wine & beer although the selection is limited.  What they do carry is delicious.  The menu is small, but fresh, tasty and very reasonably priced. The bruschetta might be the best in town (sorry Postino's). The dingy strip mall surrounding the restaurant is a real eyesore, but they do an admirable job of creating your own little oasis in the cement.  They are pet friendly which makes it great for a Sunday morning bike ride with the pooch (the bloody Mary will knock you off your seat).  Be prepared to sweat. It is REALLY warm inside during the summer months.  The patio is cozy, covered & there is a mist system, but being surrounded by a huge mass of concrete diminishes the cooling effects.  Although the interior is cramped, everyone is friendly and the barkeep will remember your favorite drink and dish and the owners are often your neighbor on the bar stools. There are very few neighborhood watering holes or coffee shops around here and I am so happy for this spot. I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Awesome drinks food and especially awesome lady in the morning never forgets to remind me about the punch card.  And they have a drive through."}
{"text":"Great place for coffee! They offer both soy and almond milk and have a wide range of syrups. The drive through moves pretty quick but it can get a little backed up on a Friday."}
{"text":"12 hour happy hour rocks! Their Nutella coffees and new mexico burritos and awesome. Come back for lunch and have their cobb salad and soup of the day. Their 4 to 6 munchies are amazing the bruchettas are perfect with a variety of $5.00 glasses of wine. Dinners of the night are for people who really love  good food. The patio is perfect this time.of year. Also their free WiFi is icing on the cake!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite cafes in AZ. The setup is so calming and secluded you forget that you are in the heat. I come here almost every weekend for breakfast and have a Nutella coffee and their New Mexico. Every time I come it meets my expectations and leaves me very satisfied!"}
{"text":"If you go to the place and spend hundreds of $$$ over the course of a couple years......don't expect more the $5 off your second bottle on Tuesday.........even if the online ad doesn't mention that....
And if  you complain.......you will be thrown out and police called.
Pathetic

Very. Rude. Owner.
Enough said."}
{"text":"Stopped here today to get a quick lunch. This is not the place to go for a quick meal or for good customer service! However, the food was delicious and worth the wait. The BLT had lots of crispy bacon and the bread was crunchy and had great flavor. The patio is adorable and very comfortable."}
{"text":"Cool, hip little coffeehouse. The Nutella Mocha is a must. My parents were not sure what to think when we walked in but they ended up loving it. Nice ambiance inside with candles and a relaxing looking outside seating. I also got the hummus and vegetables but ran out of vegetables with over half of the hummus left ha."}
{"text":"I have been going here since they opened and everyone who works there is great and its always nice to talk to everyone both the employees and customers. The coffee and food are great, I have had coffee all over North America and this definitely ranks high for me."}
{"text":"I'm a little confused about all the 5 star reviews. I've been in a few times and used the drive thru a few others. Coffee is good, a little better than sbux. The idea is great, the feel is great. The execution... leaves something to be desired. 

I don't even get why they have the drive thru. They don't have a speaker to give your order. So basically you have to pull up to the window to get your order in. This creates huge problems if there are a few cars in front of you. I've spent over 20 minutes in this drive thru or waiting off to the side while they prepare the food or drink. 

The delay wouldn't be an issue if I were inside relaxing, but if speed isn't going to be a priority, then just skip the drive thru all together. 

Long story short, visit this place over sbux as long as time isn't an issue."}
{"text":"We love this little neighborhood cafe.  They have created an oasis in the middle of a parking lot of an aged shopping center.  We enjoy riding our bikes here with the family.  They have yummy salads and sandwiches and a great happy hour.  $5 bloody Mary's and mimosas all weekend"}
{"text":"My girlfriend, my husband and I have eaten there three times lately. Gourmet food, great prices and a huge surprise inside what I thought was just a coffee place. So much more"}
{"text":"If I could give them a negative star I would. Because everytime i have been there it has been just that: NEGATIVE. This place is an absolute joke! Their attitude of pretentiousness and judgement is extremely hurtul. Get off your highhorse Rebecca and PC staff.  You shouldn't be treating people like u do. There is something seriously wrong with your way of thinking! Get over yourself."}
{"text":"If you are a parent going to Imagination Avenue, which is the same shopping center, stopping here is a must.  They have a drive thru with all the same kinds of things you can get at any good coffee house.  Then after your kids are worn out from playing, you can go back to get lunch.  My turkey sandwich was so good.  The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Customer service much ? No. None. The atmosphere was alright. The latte was alright. The   lukewarm sandwich and day old unflavored tomatoes on my salad were gross, but not as gross as their customer service. Upon walking in, we stood at the counter to order and look at the menu board, we were handed a menu and asked to sit down to review it, leading me to believe this would be more of a semi-full service restaurant. We ordered food and drink and went out to the patio. No one told us that our drinks would be ready at the counter. After a while a waitress brought out our food and we asked about our drinks. She simply said \"yeah, they are inside. You can get them at the bar.\" Who does that ??? Who says that ? Bring our drinks to us or explain that upon ordering. The staff was incompetent and the food sub par. Coffee was ok, but I wonder what my toxic plastic intake is due to the fact that they have their exposed cup storage sitting in a patio outdoors. Nope nope nope. I will be recommending that no one ever go there. This was my second attempt at this venue (not even worthy to be called a restaurant). Disappointed. Disappointing. Disrespectful. Dissatisfied."}
{"text":"These guys rocked Restaurant Week.  I attended a few but here...The food was amazing!  Had the artichoke dip, amazing!  Then the Nutella braised short ribs...omg to die for!  Espresso dessert was the perfect finish to all of this.  And if the food was not enough, the drink pairing was a perfect match and all unbelievable!  You smashed it 32 Shea!"}
{"text":"The food, coffee and drinks here are bomb, the employees however were somewhat rude.  Try the breakfast buritto and a mimosa! They are dog friendly, if you bring your pup they have a water station!"}
{"text":"I got the turkey cranberry sandwich and mint lemon drop martini- both very yummy!!! Everyone we were with liked the food they got. Cute place but very small! We had 5 adults and 2 babies so we needed to sit outside and rearrange the tables to fit but it wasn't too bad since it wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! All the staff are friendly and know my name and drink. They also have great food and strong drinks for dinner, and a convenient drive thru until the afternoon. Support local and check out this place."}
{"text":"I LOVE 32 Shea. I would recommend their lavender white mocha and the O.M.G sandwich. The only reason I think twice about coming here is because I have a young daughter and the place isn't super kid friendly. Sometimes I don't feel super welcome coming in with a child, but the staff is great and I love that they have a drive through for breakfast and lunch! The atmosphere is incredible though so I would recommend eating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been here several times and enjoyed both the food and the ambiance. However, our experience on Saturday night April 8 was horrible.  We brought our son, daughter, son-in-law, and grandbaby, and expected a pleasant, outdoor dining experience.  Instead, the service was incredibly slow, the food mediocre, and the manager failed to properly address legitimate concerns.  We arrived at 7:30 pm and didn't leave until 10pm,  because the service was so slow.   We repeatedly asked for our food.  It arrived 1 1/2 hours after we ordered!   By the time we got our food, we were all so tired and starving, we couldn't even enjoy it. When we told the manager about the delay, she accused us of being wrong about the time, and tried to blame the poor waitress, telling us she would call over the server and let her explain that she had somehow failed to tell us the kitchen was slow that night.  It was a terrible way to handle customer service and not fair to the server.   The manager  gave us a free desert and 20% off the tab.  But we would have rather had good food, served on time.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Nice, laid back place. Nutella mocha is pretty good, perfectly sweet without being too much. Place is a bit small and cramped inside, it's also really dark... not a good place to come and do some reading/studying at night. Good service and nice wait staff."}
{"text":"Thirty-Touche'!!!

The Mint Lemondrop Martini is THE BEST martini in town!  A little frothy, not too sweet, great flavor and it packs a punch!  I come here often for happy hour and wish there were a few bar type munchies on the menu to go with the great drinks.  So, instead I get a sandwich and I'm good for the evening - love the turkey with cranberries.  The toasted cibatta bread gives crunch and texture.

I'm glad this is my 'hood. Looking forward to when everything else nearby updates to this standard.  They also have events to promote community, look for the mommy and me, dog days, etc.  

Love patronizing our local indy businesses who work this hard to make a dream come true!"}
{"text":"Great patio atmosphere! Carissa the server who single handedly runs the patio is AMAZING!!! She connects with her customers, which is rare these days to find. She is the reason why my family and I will be coming back here on a regular basis. Thank you again Carissa for making Shea 32 our new Friday night restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They have a DriveThru!!! With two kids under 3- this is a HUGE and amazing deal to get quality coffee and food without getting everyone out. I wish they didn't close their DT after 4PM- I would happily stop going elsewhere for evening caffeine/meals."}
{"text":"How disappointing my last visit here, and it was entirely attributed to the staff. These two girls (new since my last visit there) work there who have no concept of waiting on people, let alone running a business. They seemed more interested in chatting with their friends hanging out there then servicing customers. I sat there for ten minutes and neither of them bothered to even acknowledge me. What a shame that the good food and drink and nice ambience of the place has been ruined by an incompetent staff. It was like the place has been taken over by high schoolers. Too many other wine bars are out there that provide consistent customer service for me to bother returning to this place ever again."}
{"text":"I miss living so close to here. This place is amazing. I love how it's the perfect coffee and breakfast shop in the morning. A great place for a lunch or a pick me up drink. And by evening and night time it's the perfect place to gather with friends or a date and have a drink or two. 

Josh is great. He knows his stuff and is just awesome. Honestly everyone I have encountered for the most part is really cool and efficient. The owner is great too and always remembers Brian and I. We would bring my boyfriends cousins dog with us all the time to 32 Shea when we would dog sit. They have water bowls and treats for dogs. It's a great atmosphere and I miss living so close to here! Will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Good menu. Short but good. Drinks galore. Great girls."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here the other day, coffee for me and a late lunch for her. I got the caramel macchiato with whole milk. The service was fast and friendly. My drink came out with an adorable heart drawn on the top in foam. The drink was warm and filling without being overly sweet. My friend got a tuna salad sandwich with chips, and she said it tasted very good, with an unexpected but pleasant addition of some crunchy apple in the tuna salad. The place is very small on the inside (maybe 8 tables that can seat 2 people each? I didn't count exactly, but somewhere around there), but there's a lot of seating out on the patio. Even though it's tiny, it's feels cool and comfortable without being over-the-top hipster. The patio was a pleasant seating place. Even though 32 Shea is at a fairly busy intersection, the green shrubs surrounding the patio lent a feeling of privacy and intimacy. There was a cute little dog watering station with signs welcoming pets on the patio area, so it's a good place to go if you're a dog person. I want to come back some time and try the food myself... maybe in the spring when the weather will be perfect for sitting outside."}
{"text":"Simple dishes but great fresh flavor and impressive options for this hip spot. Jaymee's personality was as sparkling as a Cullen in sunlight (Team Edward 4life). Thanks for the tasty caprice salad and Nutella mocha! :D Perfect chillaxin outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"I have given this place two chances now. It has a great feel and is close to my home so I was hoping that it would be my new place for business and friend meetings. It has a bistro feel to it but doesn't want to be a friendly, hang out, bistro type of place. The staff is inattentive and rude. The food is decent but nothing special and I have to pay full price for an iced tea each time I want a refill. I try not to be cheap but that's $2.25 each time I fill up with plain old green tea. Perhaps the last straw was sitting in the patio area and watching the owner ask two people who had settled in with their two beautiful and well behaved dogs to move from a table with four chairs to a table with two when the place was nowhere near full. Then watching as she moved the umbrella that was shading our table back to another table almost knocking people and drinks over in the process.  This could be a great place but it needs a major attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! This tiny place in an otherwise overlook-able parking lot is a diamond in the rough. It's hip, clean, fun, and versatile. 

Need some coffee in the morning to kick start the day? Coffee is great here and they make it quickly. 

Need a lunchtime meeting place? Indoor and outdoor seating and a good menu give you options.

Going on a date? With food, wine, and a full drink selection you are covered. And the cute modern ambiance does nothing but help facilitate an enjoyable evening. 

Tiny and fantastic and worth a visit. Or two. Or three..."}
{"text":"Love it.  We've been going regularly since they opened.  I switch between the coffee and the nutella mocha.  Both are great.  Food's good.  The staff are very friendly and welcoming.  Can't wait till they start serving beer and wine."}
{"text":"The tomatoes on my open-faced pesto grilled cheese sandwich tasted like... tomatoes, actually! At least the ones I remember from when I was a kid. Was not expecting something so simple to taste so good and fresh! I was by myself-- and don't usually like dining alone, but as soon as I entered the door, the bartender, Josh, made me feel right at home. Later on, the owner came over and chatted with customers for a while-- which was so nice! 

The atmosphere is welcoming and hip, with a romantic feel (great date setting), and the food fantastic.
My only complaint is that it is so far from Fountain Hills. The fact that I'll be back, with friends, despite the drive, says a lot. I'm trying the Happy Hour, next time!"}
{"text":"My review is in two parts....first the food and service,  I came here solely on the write up in the North Central Phoenix News which gave this place very favorable reviews, especially the Mint Lemon Drop Martini.  I am a HUGE lemon drop fan so that is what made me make the short drive up the 51 to find this cute little bistro.  Its an adorable little place with a great dog friendly patio and cozy inside space.  I took a seat at the bar but quickly moved outside because it was just too warm.  The bartender was charming and very informative and made me my Mint Lemon Drop which was just as tasty as I was hoping it would be.  

I wasn't that hungry but wanted to nosh on something so I had the Lahvosh of the day which was a bacon avocado.  The portion was plenty and the lahvosh was still crispy when it came to me and not soggy.  I ate every piece.  My only negative comment would be on the outside space....I sat at the outside bar and it was very uncomfortable.  The barstools don't have backs to them and the bar top is a little too high for comfort.  Also there was a lot of bird droppings on the bar top and it needs to be repainted.  The tables and chairs on the patio are metal and there are no cushions for the chairs which look like they would be very uncomfortable.  The ambience of the place is charming though and like I said, the food, drink and staff were just fine.  I will definitely go again but will probably ask for a table inside.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"A perfect place to meet clients for a coffee or grab a light breakfast. It's always my go-to place to relax in the morning when I have a day off. I'm so happy that this place has had such success- the result can often mean a significant wait time and trouble finding a place to sit however. I went once for dinner and wasn't really impressed with the meals- definitely more of a wine bar vibe at night with light appetizers. Great staff, great coffee and breakfast food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The new Mexico burrito is to die for. The atmosphere is laid back and cool. The employees are super friendly will come back!!!"}
{"text":"Visited tue evening. All inside tables full. Very warm inside. Sat at the bar. Food was a little slow coming, no big deal. Enjoyed our drinks. Roast beef sliders are great. Chicken chop salad was big and very good. Recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"We were not as impressed as other people. I did like the patio but the only open table did not have an umbrella. I asked for one since it was hot and sunny and was told the one for that table is broken and they don't have any more. We brought our two dogs to the dog friendly patio and when we asked for a bowl of water for the dogs we were told there is a charge of 25 cents! How horrible is that to have a dog friendly patio and not even give them water! We were ordering two meals and two beverages so we were put off by that charge of 25 cents. Also, they just give you a paper bowl and you have to fill the water yourself. The sandwich comes with chips and if you want the soup upgrade it cost $2 extra. When the food came out we couldn't believe how tiny that soup is. Don't bother spending the extra $2. You have to clear your own dirty dishes and trash. The place just does not seem like it is run that well. Our sandwiches were mediocre and small portions. No pickle on the side of the sandwich and no garnish. It said sandwiches come on a \"toasted ciabatta\" which neither of ours were toasted and I would call it more of a hamburger bun rather than a ciabatta. I don't see what the hype is about and we both agreed we wouldn't bother going back."}
{"text":"Feels intimate and friendly-like I found my neighborhood's pulse-point.  I love the improvements on the patio, casual atmosphere and creative pairings.  Specials are delightful escapes from ordinary, but their ordinary is delicious!"}
{"text":"Meh. If you want to skip the details, there are plenty of better places. It's more dog friendly on the patio than kid friendly because of the service. Came here for restaurant week and it was lopsided. For instance, for service we would give it a 2 to 2.5 star rating. The concept of the food we would give a 4 or 4.5 rating. Execution of that concept was 2-3 stars. The frustrating thing is with a little training of the wait staff, and a little more tasting of the food before it goes out of the kitchen and we would agree with the 4 stars. 2 starts feels a little harsh but the yelp \"Meh. I've experienced better\" was exactly how we felt.

First the food: We have the salmon salad and gorgonzola dates to begin with. The salmon was a hair salty, but that was nothing to be too worked up about. The bacon wrapped gorgonzola dates appetizer was the highlight of the evening. On to the main course. We had the nutella mole short ribs and lobster mac and cheese. The first three bites of the mac and cheese were delicious- But then... after a few more bites the richness of the plate began to weigh in, and left us wanting  some kind of vegetable, or color, or something to break up the monotony of an otherwise good dish. Lobster mac can be found in a lot of places, and this just seemed like a lazy attempt at it. Nutella mole short ribs-- The risotto that accompanied was very rich, which made the mole all the more heavy because of its richness. Nutella mole was very sweet and would have been better pared with some kind of spice-- some habanero or something to counter the sweetness. Finally the desert course. K had the mascarpone cheesecake and I had the espresso mousse. The espresso mouse was very good and well done. I'm a coffee drinker and did not think the espresso was overpowering. The cheesecake... we walked away thinking that it was store bought and not made from scratch. Still good, but not great.

Now for the service. We elected to sit on the patio with our baby since the patio is very well done and inviting. We walk past two employees, and although I am carrying a car seat and a 20 pound child, offer no help as where the front door is. Ok, no prob, that's our fault I suppose. You have to be smart enough to get inside a restaurant. We are quickly seated because we are certainly on the early side of the dinner crowd at 5:30pm. With a sleeping baby and a setting Phoenix sun, we are thankful to be sat at a 4 top table (one chair for the baby and 30 things that must accompany a baby). And then we wait. 20 minutes later the server tells us that her \"boss would kill her\" if she kept two people at 4 top table. So wait... the manager would rather we wake a sleeping baby, move the diaper bag, car seat, bottle bag, and another bag so that you can seat us at a two top??? A quick glance around the patio and we see two ladies seated at a 4 top. The patio at this time is half full. We know when we are being lied to, and our first reaction was 1) ok, we will leave and then 2) bring you manager here so they can tell us directly. We went along with it, our fault, because it being a Saturday, we were afraid that our date night would be pizza at home. Here's a tip for service industry people that don't have kids: when you see a couple out, and they have a child/children: their night out is a big deal. It takes work to get your family out into the world and that couple is probably trying to make their night out special. If they get that special night out, the chances of a better tip and/or good word of mouth about the place go through the roof. Add more challenge to that night out and you get 2 stars. 

We knew the price going in, but after two glasses of wine (they didn't give us the happy hour price but we didn't know if that was restaurant week so I didn't say anything) and a Moscow mule (bartender forgot to shake it so it tasted REALLY strong at first) $110 after tip. No way that was worth it."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a small hands on family business and in my case the best place to go for my craving for Pinapple /coconut muffins; among others fresh from the oven!  Although I'm not there every day even; with my  visits they know my first name and what coffee fix and muffin I crave.       Its nice to see smiling faces in the a.m.

I took my very touchy, food nut girlfriend there for lunch and she loved the sandwich, score!!! one!!! as she is hard to please. Mine was very fresh, tasty and the service was great.  This is a busy place, it is small with a limited menu but that menu has very good items on it.  Like home made food! 

Being from small town Iowa (Go Boji) I want that warm family feel that 32 Shea gives me; along with smiles, great food and conversations with people that feel the same. 
So if you like the small town warm feeling, great food and banana bread, muffins and Great coffee drinks served with smiles for a smiley a.m. Always great people to chat with from all walks of life.

Make 32 Shea your stop, support small business with Great coffee, food and yummy muffins and banana bread!!  Plus if you sit and drink coffee you will probably be talking to some very well known people without a clue to who they are."}
{"text":"Great little spot! I'm usually there for breakfast and it's great but I've recently fallen in love with their lunch menu. 

Coffee is great. New Mexico burrito is great. And the lunch Turkey Stack is wonderful!

I'd recommend this for a fast bite or a nice casual meal!"}
{"text":"Love this place - especially their outdoor patio. It is a great spot where you feel like you're in a zen garden... When you're really near a big street! 

The owners clearly spent considerable time, energy and money in decorating the whole place! Everywhere you look a thoughtful detail can be spotted. For the mindful amongst you, it's a meditative experience to roam the premises with your eyes, finding visual treats amongst the leaves, tables and windows.

As a not-coffee-snob-simpleton who prefers either an Americano or espresso free of sweeteners or creams, I enjoy the coffee here. I can't speak to drip coffee, lattes or other souped up espresso drinks, but they are available for those who enjoy some flavor and variety. 

32 Shea isn't limited to just caffeination... You can fill your belly too! I've had two sandwiches here and was pleased with both - the roast beef and turkey. It's nice that it's only $1 to upgrade to a salad from chips!

Finally, the staff is very friendly, and after only 3 visits recognize me. I find that welcoming atmosphere to be a huge plus if I'm frequenting a locale!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, coffee and mimosas!  Too bad the drama queen making coffee drove off no less than 4 people in the short time I was there.  If a busy morning of making coffee is enough to ruin your life maybe consider another career.  Major attitude from this guy makes the aumbiance uncomfortable to say the least.  I witnessed one lady ask if \"he was having a bad day or if he was an a$$hole all the time!\"  Yikes.  If you want a good coffee and a great breakfast burrito with a side of major attitude this is your spot!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, but plan to come back a few more times before I decide if there are enough pros to overcome the horrific management. They have HH 6am-6pm and a \"Munchie Hour\" 4pm-6pm. The HH includes $6 mixed drinks, $5 wine, and $4 beer/cider. The Munchie Hour menu includes a list of 8 $3 bruschetta and $5 dips or a caprese salad. The employees who work here are pretty fantastic so no complaints there.

The first time I came here I got the Stacked Turkey sandwich with a side salad and an iced Nutella Mocha that they promote as \"the only Nutella Mocha in the valley\" which isn't true. I've been to plenty of coffee shops that offer Nutella coffees in the valley. The Mocha was underwhelming. The Nutella didn't shine through at all, it just tasted like a milky Mocha. The Stacked Turkey had quite a bit of Turkey on it, the bread was delicious, and it had a horseradish Dijon spread that had a bite too it. I almost with there was a little less sauce because it overpowered it a bit. Other than that it was a fine sandwich. Nothing to write home about. The salad wasn't good. Small pile of leaves with a tasteless oil dripped on it.

I'm writing this review on my second visit. I got the Caramel Blended Freeze (they call it something similar to Starbucks' Frappuccino) and The OMG (prosciutto, mascarpone, fig, and honey sandwich) with a side tomato bisque soup. The soup is delicious, but pretty small. The Caramel Freeze was better than the Nutella Mocha, but not by much. It was still really milky and not too much flavor to it. It tasted like a milkshake made out of milk and ice with caramel drizzled in the cup. The real star of this show (besides the soup) is The OMG. This sandwich is an adventure of flavor. I literally said 'oh my god' out loud after my first bite. It's subtly sweet at first and takes you on a gentle rollercoaster ride as it turns salty in the best possible way. This sandwich is a work of art."}
{"text":"Hot Chocolate Nutela... Yeah you have to have some. The food was great."}
{"text":"10/2 update - My husband and I went here for dinner a couple weeks ago.  The food and wine were fantastic and a great value.  We ate inside - what a cozy, friendly atmosphere, and the service was superb.  It felt like family but without all the annoying family members.   Also on our way in, we noticed the misters on the patio so maybe we were too dumb and/or oblivious to notice them on our previous visit.  All in all, a yummy, romantic, fun dinner so I've upgraded it a star.  We will be back!  Btw if you like serious food porn and occasionally Facebook only specials, like them on Facebook.  

**********************************
We enjoyed brunch here today and would give this more stars if the service had been better.  The food and drinks were great.  I had the yogurt and granola which was yummy.  My husband had the breakfast croissant which he said was good.  We topped it off with mimosas and a cappuccino.  Prices are reasonable.  

The place is as everyone else has described - totally unexpected cute, cozy place in a rundown shopping center.  We had our dogs so sat on the patio which is nice and makes you feel you aren't next to a busy intersection but really needs misters.

One guy at the counter was great though harried.  He was efficient, very enthusiastic and nice, even bringing treats for our dogs.  The girl - not so much.  She wasn't friendly, was way in the weeds in terms of service, and for some reason, felt it appropriate to yell at the nice guy in front of all the customers.  Apparently there was some separation of duties that he wasn't respecting, but it was clear she was in the weeds badly and needed help.  

We were really happy to support a local business and will go here again.  They do need to address the service issues as several reviewers have pointed out.  The drive-thru was constantly busy while we were there, and there was a good crowd inside.  We were the only ones on the patio.  They need to find a balance between serving the drive-thru and inside customers.  I cannot imagine how they could've handled it if the patio and inside were full in addition to the drive-thru.

One last thing - I think they could turn the music volume down just a touch.  All in all, we enjoyed our visit and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fun place, great environment, good vibes. Food is average. Quality of booze is average. Will come again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for dinner when we sat outside and enjoyed a variety of dishes to share, all were quite tasty.  Then also did the drive thru this morning for their cheddar/bacon waffles.  Again, quite tasty.  Will for sure be back.  While the weather is nice out, definitely sit outside, it's a nice relaxing ambiance and the staff is very friendly!  I've recommended this place on Diners, Drive in's and Dives show too.  Must continue to get the word out about this place!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot that's relatively tucked away. The location is actually an old photo hut, which explains the small size. The patio is the place to be--inside is a little cramped and noisy. You won't exactly be able to spread out on the patio but it's still nice and cozy. It's dog friendly, too!

Drinks are super affordable during happy hour, and the food specials are delicious. We haven't tried a bruschetta we didn't like, and the turkey sliders are delicious, too. We tend to just order small plates and drinks and hang out until the sun goes down. It's a great place to wind down on a Thursday or Friday night as a couple or in a small group. I would imagine large groups would be a challenge.

Service is overall good--they get a little frazzled sometimes but when we're there we're never in a hurry to leave. First round of drinks and apps always comes fast :)."}
{"text":"Great local place. Delicious coffee that is not too strong and not bland nor cheap in flavoring their flavored coffee. I tried the iced caramel macchiato twice and Mocha once. Both times it knocked me into heaven. So delicious. Muffins are great!  Moist and full of flavor. The best part about their muffins is they make them fresh and do not carry the regular Flavors you see everywhere else. I tried their Pineapple Coconut muffin. Wow!  Fantastic!  

The only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars would be because, although the service is friendly, it is just so slow. Each time I have been here I was not anxious nor in a hurry to be some place. So the way I see it, if I am in no hurry and the service STILL seems slow well then that, my friend, is some sloooow service."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday for a late lunch. Had a wonderful vegetarian sandwich and added their horseradish sauce. It was fantastic. Chips tasted fresh and had great flavor. Very cool outdoor atmosphere and dog friendly. Nice selection of sandwiches, salads, and drinks."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the flavor + texture of my lavender latte. Overall, though, between the service, space, and food it felt like something was missing."}
{"text":"This place had some of the best drinks. The Nutella iced mocha and the iced vanilla lavender mocha are to die for! If you love your chocolate I recommend the iced Nutella mocha. The environment is very urban and chill. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"We love 32 Shea and it has always been our neighborhood \"go to.\" We used to come here with our sweet dog over the last 5 years and it was a weekly event we always looked forward to. When he passed away at age 15 it was hard to imagine coming here without him but the staff, the food, and the ambiance has brought us back. Their dog friendly patio will be waiting for our next rescue when we find him, her, or them."}
{"text":"Had a business meeting that turn out to be a great time at 32shea.  The drinks were amazing. Nice job 32shea."}
{"text":"We went 2nd year in a row for Valentine Day dinner. Romantic, delicious dinner and friendly smiling staff."}
{"text":"Rebecca the owner has transformed this place into a little haven right in the heart of north Phoenix. 

Whether you love happy hour (12 hours - 6-6) or local great food (veg or gf, no problem) or you just want a great cup of java (they even have a drive through), 32 Shea is the place for you. 

Pet friendly on the outdoor patio which is absolutely wonderful with a gorgeous water feature and trees - sure to become a favorite. 

I'm now a regular and I'm hooked - it's cool, convenient and cute, and Rebecca has created a culture of excellence and friendliness of service in her peeps - love love!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This place has the worst service of any place I have ever been. They ignore you. And it is a very small place. There were only five people in the whole interior of the building. We are literally less than six feet away and yet they acted like we were invisible. Yet we left him a nice tip. I'm not sure why? I guess it was because we wanted to show them that we were better people than they were."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat, drink,  or just hang out.  Food is great and the drinks are just as good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-to places whenever I'm in North Phoenix. Last week was the first time trying the dinner menu, and it was fabulous.  I like their lunch staples (esp. the OMG sandwich).  I'm a supporter of this local business that serves quality food and drinks at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Been her for breakfast and coffee a couple of times, had lunch today - always a pleasant visit especially when weather is nice and can sit outside.  Inside dining room is small.  Place can get busy but for a reason.  Food is fresh and good.  Unique options.  Worth the visit if in the area and need a coffee or meal.  Prices are reasonable too.   Well done!"}
{"text":"Love this little coffee place. Not much from the outside, but the food is fresh and delicious and so are their homemade syrups. Lavender is my favorite. Yum. 
Support local businesses!!! Call ahead and they have it waiting for you, even better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a sandwich. Their sandwiches are always good quality and fresh. My favorite is the OMG sandwich and the Roastbeef (I normally do not eat roastbeef but I love it there!). Would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking to enjoy amazing sandwichs!"}
{"text":"One of favorite little haunts! It's amazing the production that comes out of a kitchen that's basically the size of a small bedroom. The Nutella Mocha is THE reason I go there. They offer non-dairy options. The verde salsa that comes with breakfast burrito is excellent! Love it love it!"}
{"text":"Love this little spot! Great food and drinks. Very chilax place to hang out at. 
Service is overall good and they have a funky, fun bathroom!!"}
{"text":"I had been to this place three or four times before this visit.  Food is good but service seems to be subpar always.

This last visit was particularly bad.  We entered the restaurant and stood around waiting for somebody to guide us to a place to sit.  Finally, a guy comes over and asks our preference and we tell him outdoors will be fine.  He seats us and we wait for about five minutes.  Finally, a waitress (Ithink the owner) comes over and tells us harshly \"you can't sit here\".  I say \"we were seated by a waiter\".  She says you can't sit here.  I ask why.  She says, \"because it is reserved for a large group\".  I say \"where can we sit\".  She leads us to the indoor seating.  We sat and waited for 20 minutes.  Nobody attempted to wait on us.  Finally, we got up and walked out.  Saw her again on the way out and said,'your service sucks\".  She just looked at me - no apology, no excuses.  This lady is evil.  Saw a broom in a parking space on the way to the car.  Surmised it must be her mode of transportation.  This is unfortunate.  This place has the ability to be a real bright spot in our neigborhood.  Unfortunately, bad ownership or help can ruin what could be a great experience."}
{"text":"32 Shea is a great place to go all times of the day. You can swing by and grab your work coffee and treat, stop by with your fur babies and enjoy their patio after a hike, or to meet for lunch. We also love their Monday night Lavish and bottle of wine for a date night!! Their coffee and drink menu is A+ and there is something for everyone!!!"}
{"text":"32 Shea is a real little oasis.  We recently moved to the North 32nd district and we love it!  They have great food, drinks and atmosphere.  They have a beautiful patio that is a real escape from the Arizona summer and is perfect for date night (like last night), as well as meeting business associates there during the day, as I often do.  The Manager, Karyn is wonderful and together with a great team has this little gem really sparkling!"}
{"text":"Great little outdoor spot in AZ for coffee and conversation.  I've only visited once but loved the ambience and enjoyed being able to have a good coffee while my friend had wine.  Great friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood go to spot when we decide to grab a bite to eat on the fly. We love it!! Inside can get crowded quickly in the evenings or weekend afternoons but the patio is a nice seating option that we have often taken advantage of, especially during the cooler months! We always get fantastic service, and the lobster mac & cheese is absolutely positively to die for!   The salads are all delicious, and portions are not small but not too large either!  During our drinking days, we treated ourselves to their blueberry margaritas which are phenomenal and are seasoned with fresh blueberries!  Now the iced tea is our drink of choice!  Highly recommend this little gem that's packed with atmosphere and a quality menu!"}
{"text":"Adorable little place! Great coffee drinks! The sandwiches were great too. The tuna my looked awesome as did the sliders that kept going by. I tried the turkey sandwich which was great. 

They were very dog friendly. We sat on the patio with our small group of people and group of dogs. It was great to have a place like this to enjoy food when we had the dogs  with us. 

I recommend the mocha Nutella latte! It was fantastic! The cocktails looked fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Great coffees and cold brews. Much better tasting and better priced than Starbucks. And locally owned! I've only had the breakfast sandwich. Good fresh ingredients. Will be back to try more and use the patio. Only have done the drive thru."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food, good people, and great drinks. Love their breakfast menu and the iced Toddy! Dog friendly and super cute cozy atmosphere with a great patio."}
{"text":"Loving this local spot for brunch or happy hour al fresco patio dining.  One of those fun places that vibes coffee house or wine bar.

Very reasonable $5 New Mexican burrito for breakfast with eggs, hash-browns, bacon, guacamole with a spicy oniony green salsa.

Love the Nutella mocha- the hazelnut balances the espresso without being artificially sweet.

For happy hour the food is ok but I'm loving the fresh cocktails.

The staff is super busy but lacking in smiles.  They obviously see some annoying people through the day but really?"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best happy hours for cocktails. The best patio which is dog friendly,one of our dogs favorite places to go and relax."}
{"text":"This is such a fun place.  It is an oasis in a parking lot.   Their trees offer great shade year round, and their strung lights allow you to sink away into the evening.  The food isn't bad and the coffee is nice too!
  I am excited to back with a friend for a glass of wine."}
{"text":"This place is a gem and I'm lucky to live so close to it. I go there way too much, for food, coffee, or just to sit and study. They always have something different on their dinner menu, so it's worth following their facebook feed to get alerts on what new dish they've whipped up each night. 

For coffee several highlights are their Americano (great flavor), their Mochas (you can get them with nutella instead of chocolate syrup) and their drip coffee is great too. 

For drinks they have a great wine selection and some creative spins on martinis, including their espresso-tini (amazing drink). 

For food I love their new mexico burrito, their toasted nutella & banana sandwich, but can't beat their OMG sandwich (hands down the highlight of their menu) with mascarpone, figs, honey and prosciutto on toasted ciabatta. Great dinner selections and the plus there is the variety each night."}
{"text":"Good happy hour and an ok breakfast just wished they served it later on the weekends because I like to sleep in and then have a late breakfast like at 2pm lol"}
{"text":"So sad to say this, but things have changed here.  Let me start off by saying we have loved this place for years and don't typically write negative reviews - especially for special local shops like this one with lots great folks behind them.  

But the past 3 times we have encountered problems.  Missing items, extremely burned toast, etc. 

Today's example:  

We always order the Yummy Yummy in my Tummy which on the menu explicitly states:

Yummy Yummy in My Tummy | 3.5
Warm Nutella + Fresh Bananas on Toasted Bread

Simple right??  Nutella, bananas, bread.  

As you can see in our photo, they substituted the Nutella with peanut butter. (We weren't notified).  Normally not a big deal, and we are pretty easy going -  but this kind of stuff keeps happening and it's a bummer."}
{"text":"this place is super cute but SO disappointed with my food quality & then the response I got after mentioning it to one of the servers!
I ordered the caprese sandwich on gluten free bread with a side salad.. I'm not sure what happened but my bread was completely soaked in dressing & soggy & inedible. feel like it must have just sat there waiting for my dining partner's order to come out. also the mozzarella (which should be the best part) was hard & rubbery - totally inedible as well! ..reminded me of dried glue. I let one of the servers know so next time they could prepare it better! instead she asked me if I wanted to now talk to the owner... no I just wanted to pass on that it wasn't a good experience & I was disappointed! ..not talk to 3 different people about how bad it was while they look down at me. she tried to blame it on the gluten free bread - but that was actually really good! just not the bottom pieces that were soaked & soggy... be nice to your customers! cute environment, good mimosa, but subpar food & weird vibes when trying to pass on a message to management."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Here are my personal reasons:

-They have nutella coffee... that deserves 5 stars alone.  
-They have great customer service.  They nearly always remember my husband's name since he is in there more often than I am.  
-You can call in your coffee order ahead of time.... what?! Yes, you really can.  This is an amazing thing!  Take that Starbucks!  
-They have great food and on Tuesday nights you can get $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta.  Don't get me wrong, I love Postino's for this deal, but this place actually has parking without the hassle!
-You can bring your dog...although it seems like very few people take advantage of this.
-They have bike racks for when we ride our beach cruisers over instead of walking
-It's walking distance
-Cute patio with misters and fresh herbs growing all around
-The Nutella/Espresso martini.  It's no longer on the menu (or wasn't last time I was in), but I've asked and they've still made it for me.  So. Freaking.Good.

If you aren't convinced yet, stop reading this and just go try it out.  

Don't expect a huge menu or a large indoor seating area.  It's tiny and it's meant to be a great, tiny, local spot.  Go when the weather is nice and sit outside while sipping a nutella martini and eating bruschetta.  If you're disappointed, then I'm not sure what to tell you."}
{"text":"Fantastic drive-thru service the VERY BEST and i have workd at coffe shops thank you all for your amazing window serviceI am a solo biz owner oF 30 plus years  I no how hard it becomes to \"manage\"it all .... so my review is to  the owner Rebecca for keeping this all together..  you have a great location great menu great events and a great staff thank you for all you do  and  remember our new word is ...NEXT.... HairDoc TK"}
{"text":"I'm right up the road from here and it is my default choice when I want something well-priced without a long wait. The serving sizes are perfect! I don't like to eat much first thing in the morning so I order a $5 item which fills me up. My husband who is just shy of six and a half feet tall orders two items ($10 total) unless he is just wanting a snack. I can't stand when places are expensive just to be expensive and could easily give you 2/3 of the food at 2/3 of the cost and be reasonable, this place solves that problem for me. 

They also have alcohol for any time of day... that makes me sound like an alcoholic, but I'm sure you can understand what I mean. If you want a morning cocktail, they have mimosas and bloodys (though you'd seriously injure a vamp with your garlic breath after their bloodys). Lunch rolls around and you want a glass of wine, they've got you covered. Don't feel like cooking dinner and want to let loose with a cocktail, they've got a ton of options. 

For about a month, I had an obsession with caprese salads (I still do, but it has lessened) and theirs is only $6 so I'd get a caprese with a sauv blanc for lunch or go through the drive thru on my way home from work which is surprisingly quick. They have so many options that are very affordable. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We really like having a nice neighborhood place that can serve a great glass of wine as well as a terrific breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and cannot believe I haven't taken the time to write a review yet! So many reasons this place deserves a 5 star rating. I will start with the bathroom. Sometimes bathrooms do not get enough credit. Check this one out, I'll leave it at that. Food = amazing. Drinks = amazing. Service = amazing. Patio = even more amazing. And it's dog friendly! This is a place you do not want to pass up."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to go here after struggling to find a place in the area that was open on Christmas Eve. We ordered the Tuna Melt and the open faced grilled cheese and both entrees came with a side salad. Everything was amazing and the outdoor seating was quite nice. The prices were not too high and the service was excellent. Definitely going back before I head back to California."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the OMG...I think it might be the best sandwich I've ever had. Tomato basil bisque with grilled cheese croutons, Yes, I said grilled cheese croutons. Sooo good. Great cute hidden gem, and great quality food...friendly service!"}
{"text":"I am probably here at least once a week.  I work nearby and this place is a great spot for breakfast on the go (I always order ahead) amazing lattes, solid lunch sandwiches and great drinks after work."}
{"text":"It is a treat to have a great spot for coffee/tea, or a bite to eat here in the neighborhood. I am currently loving the seasonal Pumpkin Spice Chai Latte made with real pumpkin purée. The homemade Nutella Cheesecake is also a must have if you save room for a treat! The staff is friendly and fun to chat with. There will usually be some sort of hustle and bustle happening as 32 is a popular spot (also depending on when you're in) but it is always comfortable and laid back. When the weather is nice, sitting on the patio is a must! I do wish the shopping center where this is located had more (improved) stores or restaurants. 32 Shea is without a doubt the best thing happening at this intersection! I highly recommend this spot for both out of town visitors and Phoenix locals!"}
{"text":"What an awesome spot in an unexpected place.

Great food, great service and fair prices.

I had the special I'd the day (Wednesday is burger and shake).

The burger was good although I would rather have fries instead I'd sweet potatoes but oh well.

The coffee is pretty good too and they have home made syrups.

Cheers

Fun fact. There's a comfy chair I'm the bathroom wtf?"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this adorable neighborhood spot?
We love their hummus, spinach and artichoke appetizers.
They also have a yummy selection of bruschetta.
We enjoy coming here for brunch as well.
They have wonderful happy hour specials.
The outdoor seating area has a lovely ambience when the weather is cool enough to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab something healthy on the go thanks to their drive-thru!! Very reasonably priced for the quality of food!! I have found a new spot!!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I love the New Mexico breakfast burrito, something so simple but delicious! The coffee is great ..I prefer caramel with caramel sauce only freezacino! They are very accommodating staff! Eating local is fun!"}
{"text":"I love this little place. Beautiful outdoor setting (inside is a bit small) with shade, umbrellas, misters and the ability to have protection from the traffic on 32nd Street Their drive-thru is fast, even though they have you pull forward and then bring your food out to you. 

This is also a dog-friendly place on the patio, very cute little features for dogs (and dog parents). 

Service is good and fast. You can tell they try to be efficient and accommodating. I have tried only the breakfast items since I'm out early hiking with my dogs. But I'm bringing my daughter here next time she visits (in November to run Ironman Tempe). There are lots of athletes who stop in here, as well as businessmen and women, and casual friend meetups."}
{"text":"I've watched this little spot go from completely unknown to the beautiful inviting oasis away from it all that it is now and on top of it being beautiful they have wonderful food and great service. I would highly suggest making time to stop by for drinks and lunch!"}
{"text":"5 stars for ambiance. Great outdoor area very green and lush even though it's in the middle of a parking lot. Dog friendly! Cozy and intimate. 

Sometimes confusing if you're supposed to order at the front or if they come around to take your order. I've had it both ways and can't figure it out. 

3 stars for food. Bruschetta is yummy and good value. Other items are okay. Menu is limited since kitchen is small and have few items. Portions are small-medium. Mildly overpriced. Breakfast is so-so. Probably wouldn't get that again. The green smoothie comes from a bottle. Not fresh produce. 

Would still come back because overall hangout spot is nice and close to home."}
{"text":"32 Shea is a true gems of my neighborhood. I was raised a few blocks from it, went to Shadow Mountain and bought my own home in the area 9 years ago. I'd seen this place change hands a million times. My brother is a true foodie and we both prefer to support mom and pops over the corporate chains. We took our dogs and were very  impressed. Between the cleanliness, upbeat atmosphere, delicious fresh ingredients and beautiful presentation, this place has it all. The happy hour specials are fantastic and well priced.  The fresh mozzarella and basil sandwich is to die for. nothing quite as heavenly as a relaxing morning with a breakfast burrito and Java concoction from 32 Shea. I've enjoyed the drive thru for delicious coffee drinks. I'm usually a Starbucks girl, but am making a concerted effort to keep the little guy in business. I gave this place a 5 star rating because for the most part it is just that. I have had some less than ideal encounters the past few times. A few of which left me not wanting to come back. For awhile my drive through orders were always inconsistent. Vastly different taste and texture than the exact same drink. (Their version of a caramel frap). I'm not big on complaining, but the third time it wasn't even close to what the owner had made. I   asked if it could be remade. This was not well received. There was no one behind me. I don't know if it was remade or not, but the second one was equally bad. I just took it and left. I always had great success with the owners and decided I'd just go if I had the time to go in.. I've gone once since that time and it was strange. On our only visit for dinner,  we were treated poorly and walked out. Being in recovery, we don't drink. This appeared to annoy our server and we were not given the good service received during lunch or breakfast visits. I'd still recommend 32 Shea based on food quality and presentation, it's just not a place I'll frequent for dinner."}
{"text":"Roast beef sandwich was very good. Service was not great. Would definitely go back and try other menu items. Four stars because the food was great,  and there isn't anything else near me with comperable food. I'd say it's priced fairly."}
{"text":"This place is just absolutely quaint, quiet and beautiful! I really enjoy the food but most importantly, the coffee! If you're looking for a place to relax and unwind, this is the place!"}
{"text":"This place is a great little cafe right in an area which needs life brought back into it. I always feel better buying coffee and food here as I know the money stays here. What better way to improve the neighborhood. Owners passion really is evident when you see her working her butt off all while keeping a smile. Josh and Jeff best in the BIZ!"}
{"text":"Update: I've been back a few times since my initial review and the last 2 times I have ordered and paid  cold brew, I've been given warm and watered down iced coffee. If you're out of cold brew just tell me! Don't serve me some hot water and call it cold brew.

Good food but the service is always terrible. I feel like each time I go the wait times get longer and longer especially in the drive thru. I went for breakfast and got half my order in 10 minutes but had to wait an additional 15 for the rest of it! First half was cold by the time I got everything."}
{"text":"THE best Lox & Bagel for only $7.50!
This cute little joint does salmon right. They cure their own salmon and serve it with a good amount of cream cheese, a toasted bagel, slivered red onion, a carrot and daikon mixture and capers (they need to add a few more capers to each order, i only had 4 on each half and I really like those little buggers). 
They have happy hour all day so you can accompany your breakfast with a $5 mimosa.
There is no table service, so walk in and order at the register, then your food is delivered to your table and if you're lucky the chef himself will come out and chat about his food.
The service here is never warm and fuzzy, but they get the job done and I always leave happy."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru to grab some coffee today and both drinks tasted terrible. My Nutella mocha tasted burned, no mocha or Nutella. I won't be stopping by again."}
{"text":"Well , i am a total foodie and breakfast person, but not impressed. Ordered a bloody mary and it was bloody crap!! So i stayed cool like always and then got the New Mexican burrito and it we as tiny for 5 bucks amd it a filibertos style which are much more filling , so then i ordered a sid of bacon amd i got 1 Freaking strip !!! Wtf ? I said .. anyways the guy at the register was very cool and he understood my point. Thats the only the reason they got 2 stars. He was a total gentleman and very informative."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment on several occasions and I have nothing negative to say about the food and drinks however the customer service is less then desirable. On every single visit I was made to feel like I was a huge inconvenience by most of the employees there including the \"manager\" herself. With the exception of 1-or 2 employees the rest of the staff present themselves as very unfriendly and give the impression they do not want to be there. They  never have a smile on their face. They don't say thank you. I've asked questions about the menu items and was made to feel rushed and like I was bothering them. My last visit was by far the worst. I ordered an iced coffee and when I got it I realized there was a lot of milk in it. I went to the counter to ask what kind of milk they used and I was told unless I specified other wise they use whole milk. I appologized and explained I was lactose intolerant and it didn't occur to me at the time to ask about an alternative. I was rudely told well most people tell us I again apologized and assured them I was not blaming them in any way. To make a long story short the manager refused to make me a new drink unless I paid for a second drink. I find this TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. We are talking about a $4 drink that's the customers cost. It cost the restaurant significantly less. I can't believe that they are so petty and desperate for a few bucks that they are willing to lose repeat business and recommendations and future potential business just for a few bucks. When I conveyed this to the manager I was told that was the owners policy. Very sad because I wad looking forward to many more visits at this establishment and would have definitely recommended them to all my friends and coworkers. Very disappointing. Shame on you. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"They have the best breakfast burritos.  The sauce has a lot of fresh garlic and it is quite a treat.  There is no better coffee in the valley.  Generally, I drink my coffee black but sometimes their rotating seasonal lattes are too tempting!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I don't want to review, because it's my little gem and I don't want to share it! I decided to be selfless today and let you in on this little secret.. This place is all the rage. They have amazing locally roasted coffee (Matador), homemade syrups, beautiful food, and lovely service. I could just pop in here and hang out for a few minutes... I love the people who work there- they are the sweetest."}
{"text":"I am definitely a big fan of their coffee, homemade syrup flavors for the coffee and their pastries!  The inside is super cute and the outdoor patio is a really great space!  The outdoor patio is dog friendly which is a plus.  I am excited to go in the evening and have some wine and appetizers!

The staff is friendly and always smiling, which is nice at 7 am in the morning.   The place does get busy and you can always call and order ahead if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the outdoor patio. Not only is it dog friendly (I didn't even bring my dog with me), but it looks so beautiful at night! This is a place for date night. I, also, love their food! This has become my new favorite place for bruschetta! I don't know where this place has been all my life! We had Brie + Apples + Honey, Prosciutto + Mascarpone + Figs + Honey, and Salami + Pesto + Tomato...  I recommend all of them! Oh and don't forget to try their nutella cheesecake! I'm not a big cheesecake fan, but man was that nurtella cheesecake good! I'm going to make more of an effort to swing by this place more often."}
{"text":"Who'd thought you could make a cool spot in a parking lot in north Phoenix?  They have!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  As I have read in other reviews, most people have driven by this place and never stopped in.  I recommend everyone to stop and try it!  I took my cousin here when she came to visit.  We went for dinner.  the ambiance was great and the food was even better .Mostly salads and sandwiches on the menu so it's good for a light meal.  Drinks were amazing too!! Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC neighborhood spot whether it is for breakfast, lunch, happy hour or dinner!  The patio is amazing - and relaxing.  32 Shea hosted my birthday/work anniversary party, and their attention to my guests was impeccable.  I have held many 1:1 meetings here, and every time, my guest has loved this place.  Rebecca (owner) has been extremely helpful for me in catering lunches to offices.  Her staff is perhaps the friendliest around.  I can honestly say that I have not had a meal here that wasn't excellent.  I would also put their brochette up against anybody else's !  32 Shea is THE best kept secret!"}
{"text":"Ok- though I don't live in the immediate area, I'm there every week!! I found my cool spot giving me quality me time, while my daughter is at soccer-right down the street and my son is at hockey practice.  Marc is always behind the bar!! He is engaging and will chat- it doesn't matter if there is one or a full bar and restaurant - you feel like the most important person!!
Rebecca - the owner- omg!! She gets to know all who come in, but she is very unassuming ! I ( stupidly) asked her if she worked there, nicely she said she was the owner!!!! Amazing business woman and always remembers me when I come in!
The atmosphere breeds conversation and friendship. You may go in thinking - a glass of wine and a little work - never happens. It's a glass of wine, or one of the specialty drinks-- and new friends. If you haven't been , go,.  Also coffee!!!!! Omg this would be my local coffee place!!
Please don't go on Tuesday-- that's my day and I want my seat at the bar!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today with the family and wasn't expecting anything spectacular but once we arrived it was cute and hip. We didn't get any food but the drinks were refreshing espicially with the Ariozna humidity and heat this summer. We got one Chai Latte (non dirty), Ginger beer, and a Caramel Machiato. We sat outside which was like sitting in a tranquil area with the misters blowing on full blast and lots of shade with umbrellas and trees which subsided the summer heat."}
{"text":"Excellent experience here! First off, the location throws you off a bit; but once you get into 32 Sheas little atmosphere, you'll be surprised how nicely ambient the place really is. I ordered an iced chai latte, which is probably the best one I've had in Arizona.. Trust me, I've tried many chai lattes. I also ordered a vegetarian sandwich on ciabatta and that was excellent as well. I came here to study and its a great spot to do that. I'll definitely come back when I'm back in the area!!"}
{"text":"A total gem in a seemingly run down shopping plaza. This place is cozy, quaint and full of charm and character. I felt like I was in the middle of a trendy neighborhood district in San Francisco as opposed to the barren shopping plaza I actually parked in. My hubs and I arrived at 8:30am on Sunday morning for our monthly brunch and placed our orders also immediately. There were a handful of patrons but we managed to find a table easily. Plus, the patio outside has more tables where you can sit with your four-legged friend (bonus points!) and enjoy the weather. 

We waited about 10 minutes before our food arrived. I ordered The OMG sandwich which sounded so interesting I couldn't NOT try it. It included prosciutto, marscapone and figs on a tasty ciabatta bread. I was delighted with my sandwich. Yes, I said \"delighted\" because it was that great of an experience for me. I don't even like sandwiches usually....really, ask my husband! He had the Early Bird sandwich which he said was absolutely delicious. His only complaint was that it was small on the portion size and he could have eaten two more of those things. We were both quick to point out though that we could have gone to Denny's if we wanted quantity and mass production. This place has high quality ingredients and gourmet concoctions. We will definitely be going back! 

This place apparently is also great for some evening drinks so we look forward to seeing it in that type of setting too."}
{"text":"I usually don't review a place after only going once, since being burned several times in the past, but I was so impressed by the quality of the sandwich, I had to say It was very, very good. I will be back next time I am in the area or go out of my way if I really feel like a fresh, delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"Guess where 32 Shea is?? Yup, geniuses, it's 32nd Street and Shea Blvd! Yet, I somehow managed to pull right next to it, and still had to ask a pedestrian if they knew where it was. \"That's it. You're right here!\" she said. LOL Well, who could see it with all those trees surrounding it! 

Despite my ability to get lost at my actual destination, the aforementioned trees actually surround a rather lovely little patio café where one could easily get conveniently lost for a short time, quite happily. The interior is small but kitschy, hip and cute. The tables are nestled closely together so don't plan on much privacy. What you can count on are some inventive drink flavorings. I asked my nice barista for a recommendation and she mentioned how they make many of their own syrups for flavorings. I followed her recommendation with a house made honey-rosemary syrup infused chai tea latte, dirty. It was delicious! I really love it when any eatery makes their own blends of anything. It sets a business apart and is greatly appreciated!

Now, I didn't have any food, so I can't speak to that, but I am looking forward to going back on my next trip. It's a little bit of a drive but that's a great area for trying out little places so it could easily be coupled with other restaurants and outings. I highly recommend asking and taking one of the barista's suggestions. It certainly worked for me! Then take it out on the patio. Come on Phoenicians! In this weather, we Chicagoans would be eating up that scene outside. ;)"}
{"text":"I've been eating at 32 Shea for years and I love the food, especially the breakfast burrito. If you go for dinner, try the bruschetta, it's the best I've ever had. HOWEVER, while the food is consistently amazing, the service and attitude of the staff is consistently terrible. I don't get it. I still go because your interaction with the staff is fairly limited so you just have to sort of suffer through placing your order and you're off to enjoy the food on the patio but it would be really freaking rad if you didn't have to suffer through anything."}
{"text":"1 star is being generous after our last experience here.  Cant say enough great things about the bartender Josh, and servers Rachel and Darcy.... Its too bad that we wont get to experience their services because of the owner.  The owner may know how to light up an open sign, hire great employees, and set a great atmosphere... but she lacks class and needs to know what customer service stands for.  Im all about supporting small business and local businesses at that... but I will not support a classless piece of trash.  We were regulars there bringing in friends family and referring this place to anyone we could.  I will never go there again and dont think it is appropriate to treat customers the way she did us.  Not only did she eavesdrop on our quiet conversation, but then she butts in to tell us that we are being rude talking about how we disagree about her not advertising that only the 1st bottle is half off wine night but fails to tell us until after we have ordered 2 bottles.  Common courtesy would have been to tell us that the 2nd bottle is only $5  off when we ordered the 2nd bottle.... not wait til we question later and she wants to point to the menu stating the fine print says otherwise.  Im sorry, but i didnt look at a menu to look for the fine print when i see your Half off bottle wine night posted all over facebook.  But besides the fact,  after the disagreement, she proceeds to tell us that if we dont like it, we can leave.  Fair enough.....  let us finish our wine we bought and we will never be back.  She then threatens to call the cops if we dont leave that moment.  Unnecessary!  we werent causing a scene.  She made the scene on her own.  I will take my group of 7 that visits there 2-3 times a week and support another business.   In an economy like today, a business owner like herself should really take a step back and see where she will be if she continues to treat loyal customers and/or new customers like she did us.  I work with small business owners on a daily basis,,, and they arent successful by treating their customers rudely.  She should take this feedback as a gift."}
{"text":"This place is one of the only places that at reminds me of LA.. truly a great eatery but a great place to take a date to grab a few drinks. They have wine bottle night discounts which are great. They have a pretty different menu as fair as drinks. Bloody Mary's are 5 bucks all day, and is a the place to day drink."}
{"text":"Always loved this restaurant and the food. However had the Bloody Mary for brunch and it tasted like the sole of my shoe (don't ask how I know what my shoe tastes like).  My wife tried it and said it tasted like cold-cuts gone bad.  I told the folks at the front that the drink tasted off and asked for a different drink.  They refused to exchange the Bloody or give a refund saying the owner will not allow that specific drink to be exchanged and it is, \"hit or miss with customers.\"  Customer always right?  Not here.  You are warned!"}
{"text":"Lovely night!!! 
Perfect weather outside now, and you have the option of inside the cafe or outside in their lovely patio!! 
We picked the patio area, open aired, and not noisy at all, being that it's close to the street. Great customer service!! A++
_ Delicious food, we ordered the Mango Shrimp!! Oh soo delightful with well proportioned mango squares, avocado, cilantro and lime!!! YUM!! 
** Oh and we also went with the Tuesday special, which was Bruschetta and your pick of Wine, for the Bruschetta, you can pick three and we chose, the Fresh Mozzarella + Basil + Tomato, also the Brie + Apples + Honey and the famous Prosciutto + Mascarpone + Figs + Honey!!! OH SOO YUM!! An explosion of full flavors inside your mouth, everything from sweet to sour!!!  :) 
What a Great Combo, as for wine, we went with their ever soo fruity New Age, Torrentes!! Which was indeed a great pick!!! 
Fully satisfied!!! :)"}
{"text":"Had an \"A-OK\" breakfast here after a charity walk a few weeks ago.  After all the rave reviews on yelp, and since we were in the area, we gave it a whirl.  Can't say I was wowed by anything, but it wasn't bad either.  I can see how sitting on the patio having some breakfast when the weather is nice would be cool, but for me, not worth the drive it would take to get here.

I sampled the breakfast burrito and the croissant sandwich... both were good, but I like the sandwich more.  I had an iced chai tea, which was pretty darn good.  The Hubs had a coffee with no complaints.   All in all everything was \"A-OK,\" but nothing life shattering..."}
{"text":"They just added few items to the menu, tonight I tried the braised short ribs.... They were delicious!!  Great place to hang out. Outdoor patio is dog friendly. Good wine."}
{"text":"Relaxing, fast, and good portion sizes to fulfill your breakfast needs. What do people crave for breakfast? For me, it's good coffee, either a savory or sweet entree, and a place where people enjoy conversations. This place meets all that and they have happy hour mimosas, bloody Mary's, and craft beer. Do I even have to add it's a 12 hour long happy hour? Oh yea, that just happened!

There's plenty of places to park, but you'd think this little place would not be able to pack all the goodies food and drinks have to offer. Well, if Reno is the biggest little city in the world, this has to be the biggest little breakfast place in Phoenix. They also have a drive thru. Can I get a woo woo?

I was not too fond of my wife's choice of the  Nutella Coffee even though many people on Yelp rave about it. I did enjoy my soy chai latte. The New Mexican burrito was flavorful on the initial bite. With the egg, spices, and meat, wow this thing is good, and it's a great portion size. My wife ordered the lox, which was salmon on top of a bagel. Lightly salted cured salmon with tomato and a fresh spread of cream cheese. Very light and tasty.

The staff looked very busy on a Saturday morning. It was our first time there, and no one greeted us or asked us to check the menu. We waited for a couple minutes and accidentally asked a customer (assumed he worked there as he fit the hipster kind of look) if we could sit ourselves down. After he said you can go ahead I realized he didn't work there, apologized, then finally asked one of the busy baristas, and was able to finally order. I will say the barista was very helpful, but busy during our order. As a result, I had to knock off one star.

Overall, what a great morning hanging with our neighbors and enjoying a meal where I felt satisfied and not over stuffed. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This is a true neighborhood cafe.  I've passed this location for years and noticed some time ago that the effort to promote and build a real cafe had taken shape.  

Great spot if your getting on or getting off the 51 at Shea, or you can simply pop off the freeway for quick service.

Now is the time to sit outside.  Dog and people friendly.  

Try the Nutella Mocha-chino!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with the BF after a day of shopping and errands last night. Took advantage of the Happy Hour specials, and I can't say enough about how good our experience was!

The food was incredible from the superior spinach artichoke dip and amazing bruscetta to the rosemary lime martini. We shared 2 plates and could have gone for more, but it's so rich and unctious we decided to wait and come back again (and again, and again)

Super attentive and knowledgeable wait staff will definitely make you want to check this out! An oasis in the middle of a parking lot at 32nd and Shea...will be the perfect winter patio place after the summer furnace dies down!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but I can't say the same about the service. 

My boyfriend and I went with our dog. The sign said to go inside and get a hostess to seat us, so my boyfriend went inside while I waited. I guess they were too busy inside to even answer his question. The woman told him that she would be \"right\" with him, but we waited for ten minutes. I'm guessing she forgot about him even though he was standing right there, so he went up to her again and asked about being seated. When she finally got to him, she told him that we could sit wherever we'd like. It's pretty confusing for people who haven't been there before. I also agree with a previous reviewer, it would be a lot easier if they took our order at our table.

My boyfriend and I split the caprese sandwich and New Mexico burrito (minus the bacon). Really good. Their salsa was the best that I've had. I had an iced Nutella mocha and my boyfriend had a hot one. We both liked our drinks although I didn't really taste the Nutella.

All in all, it's a cool place. I will return to try different things on the menu like the \"veggie-tarian\" sandwich. The service could be better though. Maybe update that sign."}
{"text":"Update. Tonight the owner of this place saw my hubby and I at a Thai place and remembered us apparently. Thought it was funny after 8 months she recalled my bad review even called it entertaining. And paid our bill for dinner and added 10 straws. Guess she misses us!!!!!   Thanks for the dinner Rebecca. 


until today I would of given this place 3 to 4 stars, I liked that it was a local business. My husband and I went to this spot once a week for almost a year now, even made this the place to go to start my 40th birthday. despite having to send my food back once and getting the wrong drink once or twice I came back and chalked that up to basic mistakes.

Today the owner came out of left field on me using 2 straws and that it was costing her a lot of money and as a business owner I should respect her and only use 1 straw. my hubby even joked ok we will go to Dunkin Donuts then and she said you should. At first I thought she was kidding, but she wasnt. 

Really you would rather loose 2 loyal customers who come to you and have recommended you to others over 2 extra straws per week? if that hits your bottom line.. 

I am totally schocked at this and will NEVER go back now. 

Too bad Iove supporting local companies and such but apparently you would rather have the 2 cents than the 20 to 40 we spend there a week plus tipping your staff."}
{"text":"Got the Nutella mocha. It wasn't as sweet as I had thought, which I do prefer. The drive-thru is very convenient. The croissant sandwich was good, but I'm not a fan of fluffy eggs."}
{"text":"32 Shea is not the place for large parties.  Went with a group of 10 people.  Was very excited based on the menu.  The location is not the best, but once you are inside, you can't even tell you are in the middle of an old strip shopping center on 32nd street.  It was very nice on the patio and had a great ambience.  When we arrived, the hostess was rude and kept walking by us with a scowl on her face.  Took quite a while for them to get a table together and even then it was too small.  Luckily, most people were sharing food so we had enough room.  The waitress was impatient and forgot to bring one drink (which we later had to have removed from the bill).  I ordered a tuna salad with house made blue cheese dressing.  It was very good.  One of our group ordered a delicious coffee drink and another ordered the moscow mule and said it was great.  One person went to the bar for a margarita and it literally took 20 minutes.  She did like the drink and said it was the strongest she ever had.  When it came time to pay, the waitress said she could not do separate checks and even asked the owner, who also said no, not for big groups.  Would have been nice to know when we sat down.   I asked if there was an ATM and she said no.  I asked if there was one in the shopping center nearby and she said she had no idea.  Instead of giving us any options she simply walked away.  About 10 minutes later, we learned from the owner that while they would not do separate checks, they would allow multiple credit cards.  Again, just tell us and there is no problem.  I really want to try some of their signature cocktails, so I may go back."}
{"text":"Ok I'm gonna be honest with my yelpers, I was a little disappointed that a few were highlighting the New Mexican Burrito. Except for one that called it a formed egg burrito which made me laugh but was the most accurate. I finally took the time to drive out to 32 Shea after being excited about it for so long. I honestly went for the coffee but recent reviews were highlighting the food. I ordered the Nutella mocha &
New Mexican burrito. I give it 2 stars for the mocha because it was just ok. Nothing special from my standpoint as I'm always looking for that distinct flavor of espresso but it was not to be so. However the New Mexican burrito was just SAD!!! A formed egg, bacon that looks like its from Wendy's bacon, and potatoes on a store bought package of tortillas. Seriously yelpers the McDonald's burritos have more flavor than that! Ok I'll get off the New Mexican burrito because the salsa was actually pretty good. The mocha wasn't bad just didn't really standout. I probably won't be back. Cartel, Echo, Nami are better spots."}
{"text":"Nice little place tucked away in a shopping center.  A real hidden Oasis.  The patio is surrounded with greenery and masters which help hide the shopping center.

As for the coke.... $1.25 for a can of coke is a little pricey.  I was expecting unlimited refills on my soda, thinking it was a fountain soda.  Lesson learned.

Ice Chai tea had the perfect blend of ingredients. Definitely not completely homemade but delicious, nevertheless. 

The feta, olive, tomato, & pepperoni night bruschetta was pretty good but a little on the dry side.  We asked for a little olive oil to drizzle over it to give it that little extra pop.  Outstanding.

Salami, pesto, tomato bruschetta was a little odd.  Large slices of meat and tomatoes, like one would put on a sandwich.   Still tasted yummy but everything slide all over the place.  Would get it again. ;)

Service was outstanding.   I liked that the waiter gave suggestions and variations to the menu.  Couldn't have had a better experience.   :)"}
{"text":"I want to love 32 Shea. It is locally owned, has an awesome atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a good happy hour. I love sandwiches, coffee, and a good glass of wine- so it should be the perfect place! The reason for my two star rating is directly related to a recent experience I had with my husband and son when we went for lunch. First, we walked in to the restaurant and there was a line leading up to the cash register (normal). Initially, my husband, holding my son, stood to the left of the line. However, he was in the way of waitstaff, and had to move out of their way several times while holding a baby. No big deal- we just moved to the other side of the bar, where we would be out of the way of the waitstaff while we waited to get to the front of the line. When the line cleared up, the bartender pretty rudely told us that we needed to move to the front of the cash register in order to order because the bar was unopened. It was just kind of weird, because clearly we had just been in the line and had only moved to the side of the bar because we were in the way of the waitstaff. His attitude was just a little bit snotty and not at all understanding that we were holding a baby while trying to move out of the waitstaff's way. After we ordered, I asked if there were any highchairs. The cashier told me that they were only available outside. I get it, it is a very small space inside, but that is a total bummer when you live in a place that is over 100° for several months of the year. So, we were a little disappointed, because it was 95° and we have a one-year-old, but we went outside anyway. This is where the rating really comes in. There were three plastic IKEA highchairs, stacked sitting underneath a tree in the corner of the patio. They were filthy. I mean absolutely filthy. Caked in dirt and old food filthy. Fortunately, I had a pack of Clorox wipes with me and I got to work while my husband went to find a busser. However, even with an entire pack of wipes and the busser wiping down the highchair, it still had black dirt marks all over it and caked food. I even asked him if he would be willing to eat off of something like that, and he shamefully said, \"no.\" Husband and I were both pretty frustrated at that point but were determined to not let it ruin our day. We enjoyed our sandwiches and a glass of wine and everything ended pretty smoothly. Unfortunately, the experience just left a bitter taste in our mouths, and it will be a while before I'm ready to go back again."}
{"text":"Just raised prices. Food preparation is inconsistent.
$4.25 for a half filled cup of soup.
I'll never go back"}
{"text":"32 Shea is our new neighborhood favorite!  We've had both breakfast and dinner at 32 Shea and both meals were delicious. 

We loved sitting outside while we dined - the misters and umbrellas made for lovely Friday evening dinner atmosphere.  Tables are close together - so be prepared to make new friends - we did and had a blast getting to know the table next to us!

Bar service was a little slow on Friday night - but the drinks were mixed to perfection and worth the wait.  We will be regulars at 32 Shea!"}
{"text":"I need to start by saying this- I'm not even a huge fan of Nutella, and the Nutella iced coffee is to die for!!! I have yet to eat here, but at night they turn into this cute little wine place. Nothing but good things to say about this place. Oh, and the patio is super dog friendly! :)"}
{"text":"Just waited 20 minutes for a muffin and ice water. Paid $3 plus a $1 tip and never got served. When I finally got up to leave, I told the cashier I was leaving and to cancel my order. She said, \"Okay...\" and didn't make any attempt to give me a refund or apologize. Definitely won't be going back!"}
{"text":"5 stars for cold brew
4 stars for friendliness
2 stars for drive-thru

I have yet to go inside or order food, but based on my total drive-thru experience, I'd give 32 Shea a solid 4 stars. Everyone who I have encountered is upbeat and friendly, my coffee is always awesome, and if I hit it just right, the drive-thru is quick and painless. 

32 Shea was suggested to me countless times since I drop my kids off at school up the street everyday. After waking up one morning and deciding that I was done with my usual Starbucks routine I figured I would give them a try. I pulled up to the drive thru and it was four cars deep. Not a big deal one would usually think, but when you are someone who orders food and need to pull forward with nowhere to go, it gets a little tricky. Thankfully I got my coffee and only had to wait a few minutes for the other cars in front of me to be on their way. I almost didn't give this place another shot after that, but I'm glad I did. Every other experience has been much quicker.

Be sure to ask for a punch card. Buy 10 coffees or teas, get one free."}
{"text":"Tiny little place but I was very impressed. I've passed by this place 100 times and finally got to try it. My boyfriend and I went for breakfast. I got the Early Bird Sandwich and he had the New Mexico burrito. Both were great, but the burrito was the stand-out. Seating inside is a little cramped. There's a big patio which I'm sure would be awesome during cooler weather. The service was great. Staff was friendly and willing to answer questions, explain the menu and offer suggestions."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great food, staff are friendly and attentive and the ambiance they have created outside on the patio is like a whole other world - gorgeous! I wrote them to ask about a private event on their patio, hoping to hear back soon! Try the pistachio coffee!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place! The bruschetta is great. The OMG sandwich. The lobster Mac and cheese is great, a little pricey but OMG is it good. Great specials and a good happy hour. The customer service is always on point. Music is good as well. The patio on any day is a place to just sit and relax."}
{"text":"Hipster but nice change of pace. Loved having lunch outside by the zen garden. Definitely a cool place to try. Good local beers!"}
{"text":"Holy Lavender Latte!!!  I hope this isn't seasonal!! I loved it!!  

This place serves the best coffee ever.  I have never heard of a Lavender Latte.  Last time, I got a Rosemary Honey Latte... I think that's what it was.... Rosemary something... anyway it was great too.  This one though... wow, started my morning off right.  A little aromatherapy while I work!! 

I may have to go back for another tomorrow.  

Thanks Ms. Barista for recommending this!!!"}
{"text":"Hooray! We finally made it here for lunch. It felt as though we were in Downtown Phoenix again due to the hip and locally owned feel. I wish there could be SO many more places like this in the neighborhood.
The building is small and charming. You can certainly tell a lot of love and effort were put into making this establishment a success. 
They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Have soda's, Italian soda's, coffee, tea, beer, wine and hard liquor. It's small inside with about 6 tables and a bar with seats around it as well. Cute dog friendly patio with umbrellas outside.
Multiple Veggie options available! I had the Veggie-Tarian sandwich and it was great. Seems like they have varied menu options and special dishes that change from day to day. The ingredients were fresh and quality. 
32 has done amazingly with a concept that is very difficult for restaurants... To excel at ALL 3 meals, keep up variety, have a spectacular coffee bar, innovative menu, and now have a full bar as well. 
There is even a drive through window! 
I felt right at home and cannot wait to come back for some wine. The wine list looked extensive and varied. 
Keep supporting local and get here! It's amazing. I kind of want to live in a little loft above it."}
{"text":"If you haven't been there, you are missing out. Locally owned restaurants are my favorites and this is one of the best. Great menu with great service at a good price. Loved it"}
{"text":"This was the perfect place for a lazy, Sunday brunch. Ample light coming through the big windows, the easy-going duo at the register, and the self-service water station (?) with copper mugs hanging on hooks all contributed to the calming, relaxing effect that permeated the relatively small joint (it sits maybe 20?). I had the OMG - prosciutto, mascarpone, and fig on Ciabatta bread. The combination of sweet & savory with the layer of creamy mascarpone and honey to blend the flavors was fantastic, and the texture of bread was really incredible. I would have been happy with just the bread and some soft butter on the side. I wonder if the bread is baked in-house? In any case, I'll definitely be returning for more \"wichcraft.\" Looking forward to trying their dinner menu too, and supporting a local business while at it. A couple of things I think it can improve on: Unkemptness - it adds to that \"hanging out at a friend's house\" vibe, with crumbs hanging out here and there...but it was a little off-putting for me. And no, I'm no neat freak - I used to troll around east bay eateries all the time, and God knows they're not the cleanest of establishments to say the least. Oh, and the temperature - a tad bit cooler, and it would have been perfect. Maybe it was because the to-go window was being open and shut constantly, but I didn't feel cool enough to want to stick around."}
{"text":"32 Shea is a fantastic little place for a quick bite or you can sit outside and people watch for hours.  It is just about the best place in North Phoenix for less expensive food and a cool environment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops! LOVE the atmosphere. Has the best ice toddy with nutella & delicious breakfast foods! I love coming here with friends and my fiancé for coffee dates."}
{"text":"We've been here for both breakfast and lunch and both were delicious!  The waitstaff  is always friendly and full of great recommendations.  The Nutella latte is super yummy so give it a try.  And right now they have a wonderful pumpkin soup.  Go to 32 Shea!"}
{"text":"It was okay I guess. I asked for a heart in my latte and it was tiny, it was also bitter and there didn't seem to be any sugar. The lox bagel was pretty good, I just wish there wasn't so much onions and carrots. The outdoor seating was really nice and relaxing, especially since the weather was nice this morning. I think I'm going to come back though and try the Nutella mocha next time!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I get my morning coffee here almost every day. The staff is wonderful. They remember my name every time I come and I have established a great relationship with all the employees. I highly recommend 32 Shea!"}
{"text":"Help!! Our fav neighborhood place to ride bikes to for Sat morning breakfast is staring to feel a little worn out. Patio and tables were dirty- monsoon perhaps? Nothing a good scrub and replacements couldn't fix. Also consider a few kid friendly items- plain pancake or eggs would help. Otherwise my New Mexico Burrito and Nutella mocha and were awesome! Your presence is part of what makes the  North 32  enclave of the best places to live in town."}
{"text":"I am always disappointed when the hyped dinner specials sell out, however, the atmosphere and ambiance on the patio at night is unbeatable. This place turns into a full-blown restaurant at night, something I had never quite realized until going to dinner there. My friend and I were very impressed with our waiter and his timely service, refilling our waters after they were mildly low. Also- the food was delicious! We took leftovers home and I was eating lobster mac 'n cheese for days! Yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place - especially on patio at night.  Great food and service.  Staff so friendly and attentive.  Dog friendly place to catch a bite and have a drink."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place today and so glad I did!!  The food is fresh and wonderful, the coffee is just as amazing as everyone said it would be, and the patio is gorgeous.  You couldn't ask for a more relaxed, hip, friendly vibe. Support a great local business - check this place out!"}
{"text":"Always geeat food and drinks.  Sweet little spot in the middle of the concrete jungle. You wouldn't know it but its super cozy and quaint inside and a very nice patio. They have a killer happy hour to.You won't be disappointed. Dog friendly too."}
{"text":"I like the outside patio at Shea 32. Very pleasant with a Buddha for relaxing 
The blueberry smash cocktail is good as is the artichoke dip."}
{"text":"Great little spot.  Stopped for lunch. a crowded place inside but many open tables outside, just a bit hot today for us.  My wife had the OMG sandwich (prosciutto, mascarpone, fig and honey) loved the blend of flavors in this one of a kind sandwich on toasted ciabatta.  The turkey, cranberry and cream cheese was also excellent.  Busy spot, busy time of day yet very quick and friendly service.
A return to this fabulous little corner is in my plans."}
{"text":"Lovely place, beautiful outdoor seating. It's very popular for a reason. With this, it's important to know that there will be quite a wait for food and drinks depending on the crowd. 

I got the toddy cold brew (yum) and the Stacked Turkey sandwich (even more yum). The drinks and food servings are large and filling, which I think is worth the buck here :)

As a person seeking a cute place to study with some background noise, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"From food to the coffee, I've loved everything I've had here. The ambiance isn't the greatest, especially if you want the coffee shop feel but for a date night it's great! They also have drive through during the day for the coffee which is great"}
{"text":"I gotta say I've been here 10 to 20 times Nd hit the drive thru for a burrito. Which are delicious. Recently however I decided to come and sit down to some brunch. First off, they ask you to order at the counter fast casual style but make you pick up your own drinks(and somehow they expect tips). My fiancés burrito was cold so she had to spend 5 mins waiting in line to ask for it to be reheated. No apology. No humility whatsoever. No more than an eye roll and a spin in the microwave her burrito came back with a \"here you go.\"  The food is not bad here not overpriced. The breakfast burrito and egg croissant are delicious. The roast beef sandwich had good flavor and a decent slick of horseradish sauce. Even worth dealing with the hipsters that think that you're lucky to be in their establishment. I would give the place at least 3 stars for the food but the awful service and holier than thou servers make me want to only grab a drive thru bite next time."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends. Awesome coffee, creative sandwiches and all day happy hour!!! Best $5 mimosas anywhere!!!!"}
{"text":"I am GRINNING and SIGHING with each sip I'm taking of my Iced Decaf Vanilla Latte with almond milk. This replaces my interest in any other valley coffee shop. And now that I've found this place I am contemplating moving closer than my current city which is 30 min away!!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little modern place off 32nd street and shea. Hence the name. The plaza has definitely got a update from prior years. The positive aspect is that it has a drive through. Went there to get the New Mexico burrito. It was a average burrito and their salsa verde was homemade. Prob wouldn't get it again... however most Mexican food restaurants are closed on Sunday's so it was good alternative. Overall, I've been here a few times and food is okay not great... not life changing. They do have a cute patio."}
{"text":"UPDATE!  IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER!!  Not only does 32 Shea have THE best beverages in town (my new fave is a slow, gravity dripped iced coffee toddy) and killer pastries & food....they now have a liquor license and serve alcohol; a true bistro!  The outside patio is complete and looks amazing!  These guys are really hitting their stride!  Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"Love, Love this place! Consistently wonderful food, ambience is unbeatable. Newly expanded patio with waterfall and lighting. Excellent coffees and daily specials. Quality food and great waitstaff!"}
{"text":"Super cute place!  We had the OMG and Stacked Turkey wichcrafts.  (sandwiches).  I actually caught myself saying \"Oh, my, god!\" at my first bite."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate an event & apparently during the day you can order a drink at the bar but have to get up walk around to the front & order food & they don't give you water at the bar either. I understand if I was sitting at the table, but I'm right at the bar!! I couldn't even get bartender to say hello or tell me initially what their daytime policy was for food ordering. I had to walk around to the counter to ask for a napkin!! Martini was yummie is only reason this got 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best strip mall parking lot wine bar in Phoenix!

Lots of complaints about service, but I didn't see it. I got seated quickly and the waitress was regular johnny on the spot. 

The brochette was out of this world good. Surprisingly good. 5 star good. Would go back many many times for their brochette good. 

So why no 5 star? Well.. the wine was terrible. The wine list is small so I figured everything would be a grand slam. But the pinot I ordered was flat and the red zin my date ordered was vinegar. I hope we it was an oddity and we came on an off night.... **cough cough ** it was a busy Friday.

Oh I'll be back for the brochette (and beer)."}
{"text":"Awesome espresso and the owner, she works her butt off! Probably my favorite small coffee shop in the valley!  It's a Friday morning regular part of my routine"}
{"text":"Always busy but worth the extra 5 minute wait! Drive-thru, walk-up, indoor/outdoor dining. Delightful, shaded, well-planted zen garden with a fountain and plenty of space! Amazing teas! self-serve water, small plates."}
{"text":"Who knew this small, almost overlooked little building had potential to grow up and become so sophisticated? The owner really did a wonderful job transforming this place - I went to high school right down the street and remember not stopping into the place it was previously because it made me feel so claustrophobic. This is a perfect example of making the best use of a small space. It's beautiful, modern, and surprisingly bigger than expected inside.

My boyfriend and I are regulars here - and even though we've moved out of the area we still make the drive up as frequently as the price of gasoline will allow us. Last time I stopped in, the barista greeted me like I was his sister who just came back from a year abroad - never have I felt so welcomed to a place. He showered me with compliments and expressed genuine happiness and gratitude for stopping in knowing that I no longer live near by.

In addition to great staff, the food/drinks are DELICIOUS.
I'll just list off my favorites:

- open face grilled cheese (hot, open face caprese sandwich)
- 3 diff types of bruschetta: brie + apple + honey
                                                 tomato + basil + balsamic glaze
                                                 gorgonzola + banana peppers + sun dried tomato
- nutella cheesecake for dessert (and I don't even like cheesecake)
- Shea Breeze (cocktail)
- Iced chai w/ almond milk (their chai is very unique - so good)

Bonuses: Wednesdays are $20 for a bottle of wine + bruschetta, and sometimes they do \"Free Nutella Fridays\" where you can add Nutella to any drink for free. Also, if you \"like\" them on Facebook they post their daily dinner menu - they have a solid menu but they feature a new dinner entree every day. Including a veggie option as well. If you like to be involved with places and keep track of specials I'd highly recommend that!

32 Shea is BY FAR my favorite restaurant/coffee shop in North Phoenix. Truly a gem to the area that lacks a lot of independent/local options."}
{"text":"Staff is unprofessional and disorganized when the place is busy. I like small and cozy spots but this place gives a new meaning to the word. It's extremely cramped. Despite all of that the food is good and the drinks are great. Just be prepared for long waits on the weekend and a frustrating staff."}
{"text":"I was still sitting talking to my friend and the waitress brought us the checkout bill without us asking for it yet! So Other than that the place was great and great drinks"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Kind of in a weird spot but that's OK, I think if it was, there would be a lot  more traffic.  Awesome decor, atmosphere and patio. Nutella cheese cake is the the bomb. Only negative is that it's very small but I think that kind of adds to its appeal."}
{"text":"Really really cute place!  Awesome patio area and food is very good.  Bloody Mary ... not so much .... hence 4 stars.  Also don't love that you have to go inside to order. Otherwise really great and would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is so small that it's really easy to miss despite being literally right next to the road.  It's very small inside so be prepared to play footsies with your neighbors.  

Upon walking in, there's a distinct feeling that you're supposed to know what to do buf if it's your first time, you just stand there feeling awkward and hope that someone helps you.  Eventually someone did and we were seated for lunch.  The food was good.  

It's not a bad place but I wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"So, as far as the service goes, wasn't very professional. I was scoffed at for trying to upgrade my smoothie to a large after already swiping my card (gladly willing to pay) they though I was crazy. Finally they said they'll get it taken care of. NOW ABOUT THE SMOOTHIE.... they claim its a fresh made Green Smoothie with a long list of healthy superfoods. (See bottom of photo) This smoothie was LITERALLY Naked Juice Green Machine blended up with some almond milk. I saw them pour it into the blender, $6.50 for a 10oz glass of naked juice is what I bought. I also had the \"southwest burrito\" sounded delicious and hearty when described. It was a tiny taco bell size burrito with egg, potato, and hard bacon bits. Sad. The only reason they still get 2 starts is because it didn't taste bad. But I could have just stopped at Circle K and had the same meal for a lot less than $20."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit. Even when you don't know what you want, they will help you decide. The baristas always have great recommendations. Often times I tell them what I am in the mood for, often times I let them know I love Nutella, and they give me suggestions. They also will make just about anything on the menu and mix it up for ya! This past time they mixed up a mocha freezeacino with nutella. Pretty darn good, tasted less watered down than sbux.

I have gotten a S'mores coffee (not that great) but you know what? Its the thought that counts, what other coffee shop has a drive thru, local bakery items, friendly and helpful baristas that dont rush you in ordering, and unique drink ideas? HMM 32 Shea does. 

Come here, check out the variety, and the local flavors. You wont be upset that you did.

Located over on the Northwest Plaza on Shea and 32nd just past the 51 freeway. Go there. Tomorrow morning.."}
{"text":"They say their patio is \"dog friendly\".  Yet, then the waiter comes up to me and explains that my dog can't sit in my lap though.  She has to be on the ground.  She's a 5lb yorkie.  So give me a break.  Such bullshit.  Either you are dog friendly or not!  Not to mention service was also terrible.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"We love 32 Shea! Everything I've had on the menu is great. This is my go to place for breakfast once a week and I usually have the New Mexico burrito, which is my favorite. Everyone knows my wife and me by name and always have great service. 

On Saturday night, we attended for restaurant week. We were quickly seated and ordered drinks. The place was packed but I thought the staff did a great job of attending to us. I ordered the artichoke dip,short ribs, with mole sauce and the chocolate mousse for dessert. I didn't plan to eat much of the artichoke dip, but it was so good my wife and I ate the entire appetizer. The bread served with it was perfectly toasted with a drizzle of olive oil. Next up was the short ribs, which I thought was wonderful. I like to try new things during restaurant week and the ribs did not disappoint. We finished up with the mousse, it had what I think we're candied almond pieces on top. It was creamy and delicious! We love how the chef is so creative with her dishes, echelon the specials every day.

Great atmosphere and great food! Well done."}
{"text":"Best Green Smoothie Ever!  And they were so helpful to have it waiting for me when I called all in a rush.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Just stood at the bar for 10 mins, 2-3 servers and baristas standing right there, and weren't greeted or asked if we wanted to place and order. Wake up."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite neighborhood places to pop in... stopped in last night 3/29 with 3 friends to whom I had been bragging about how good this place is. Well, to my disappointment, while the food was good the service was slow slow slow. We felt ignored, waited a long time for our drinks... never received our 2 round (decided to cancel and leave instead) and then waited a long time for our bill.  It was clear that they were overwhelmed by their popularity and not staffed adequately. My 3 friends probably wondered why I bragged so much about the place... but I will chalk this up as an exception and will give it another chance."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! We found it about two weeks ago and have been there about seven times already. I love getting the daily entree/lavosh pizza on facebook (wish it was posted earlier in the day) and heading in for dinner. I've never been there for morning, only dinner but I love their 1/2 priced wine nights (Mon and Tues) but the best deal is Wednesday for their $20 wine and bruschetta deal. SO worth it! I love the vibe. It is definitely not a place to go for a quick dinner which is actually perfect for us as we like to take our time to enjoy our food and enjoy the ambiance. I simply adore this place and will miss Jen when she makes her move."}
{"text":"Cool place, cozy. Great atmosphere. Coolest bathroom. I had the OMG sandwich which was OMG. It was Prosciutto, honey, marscapone, and fig on a well toasted ciabatta. Great wine/beer selection and reasonably priced. Def coming back"}
{"text":"Gave 32 Shea another shot today as we heard it had changed management. We were disappointed. We went inside to order food and coffee to go. We stood at the counter to wait. After 15 minutes of watching several cars go through the drive thru and people receive orders from the counter, we asked about our order. The response was \"oh, it must be sitting in back\".  So while we waited for our order, it sat in back getting cold. 

Upon eating the breakfast we ordered, we were sorry we had tried this place again. The breakfast burritos are just not good. The coffee is ok, but not worth the price. 

Too bad this neighborhood joint can't get it together. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Always love 32 Shea!  Great food, drink an atmosphere!  It is the best addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place! Their food is very good and fresh. They offer happy hour almost all day long and the outside is pet friendly. I def would recommend their bruschetta! Only con is that it's small, hopefully they will expand!"}
{"text":"This is a very special place in the neighborhood and the food is incredible.  A local establishment with a big heart!  Not just for locals but everyone should pay this unique eatery a stop.  My dog loves lounging around in the patio, which is richly decorated with lush greenery.  A little oasis away from the hustle and bustle of city life."}
{"text":"I love this place... it's great to have a neighborhood center with good food and great coffee!!  The patio is great all year long."}
{"text":"My husband and I have really liked this place in the past.  We don't live in the neighborhood, but we decided to stop in for lunch on our way to an event.  Even though it wasn't real busy, we had to bus our own table. The general manager, Karyn, was sitting at the bar, and after I put some of the dirty dishes next to her, she didn't offer to help with the rest. When I asked a server for something to wipe the table with, she did wipe it for us, but she commented that she would let us get away with bringing coffee with us \"this time.\"  We told her we were just finishing these up and we had ordered drinks with our lunch. The rude comment was bothersome, and I didn't like feeling like I had to explain myself. 

We sat patiently for quite a while, but commented that the food was taking quite a bit longer than normal. We noticed that 3 people who ordered after us were served, so we figured ours would be out soon. Then we saw that another couple who got there well after us were served. When my husband asked, they said ours was going to be made next.  Between the long wait and the rude comment, we were frustrated, so we asked for our money back. We won't be coming back any time soon. 

In looking through other comments, I see that we were not the only ones finding the service to take way too long. I hope they figure this out because the place is cute and we've always liked the food."}
{"text":"In a seemingly abandoned strip mall, my girlfriend and I found this little nook planted right in the middle of it.  We were looking for breakfast after a morning hike and this seemed to get some pretty good reviews.  Really fun little find.  It's not quite a coffee shop, but not its not quite a restaurant, and its not quite a wine bar.  The menu isn't very expansive, but what they do have they do pretty well.

For breakfast I got their croissant sandwich with egg, bacon, and cheese in a baked croissant.  Also couldn't resist trying one of their blueberry muffins.  And decided to wash it down with a nutella hot chocolate.  The croissant sandwich was fresh, simple and delicious.  The nutella hot chocolate was awesome and perfect on a cool fall morning.  The muffin was actually a little disappointing as it tasted a little dry.  My girlfriend got their New Mexico Burrito as well as a nutella mocha.  And they also had a brie and apple turnover in the pastry display so she got one of those.  She loved the mocha nutella and the brie and apple turnover was an awesome combo of flavors.  The burrito was scorching hot, but good and the salsa was a nice accompaniment.

As mentioned, its pretty small.  You order from the counter when you walk in and they bring your food to you.  There's a small seating area inside as well as a nice patio outside.  We sat at the outside high table area which looks down on the patio tables.  The atmosphere is very casual but has a modern feel that attracts locals from the neighborhood and hipsters alike.  And the outdoor patio is dog friendly (at least three couples we saw were taking advantage of this today.

Overall prices are right and the atmosphere is super relaxed.  Total cost for the two nutella drinks, two pastries, burrito, and croissant sandwich was $23.  Food wasn't perfect and the selection was minimal, but we'd definitely come back to sample more of their menu."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed, I have been asking the organizer of my twins mom group to do a night out at this place.  Finally, she sets the date.  My husband was going to be out of town, so I had the nanny come, since I didn't want to miss it, this place being my suggestion.  I got there on time as usual, so I was the first one.  I asked the lady inside if we had a spot reserved since we were a group, and she confirmed and told me I would be seating outside in a minute.
I sat down on the bench outside to wait to be directed to my table.  Five minutes later a couple arrived and went inside.  What do you know, the server was guiding them to a table outside.  That was a little rude, but I decided to just walk myself to the table.  My friend who organized the event got in just then, and I had only one menu for me.  The server again, said she would be right back.  I ended up going in and grabbing another menu. By the way, there were only 2 other tables with customers besides ours.  Not really a happening night, it was St. Patty's day after all, so people where drinking somewhere else.  We ordered our drinks.  They are really good.  A few other friends arrived and again we were struggling to get her attention and more menus.  One of the ladies ended up going inside to order her drink, she said the server was rude to her inside also.  We ordered a few bruschetta.  Mine was pretty good, but I wish it would have been a better experience."}
{"text":"I love this little diamond of a place!! The bread is fresh, their ingredients, tasty and their garden, despite it's location is relaxing for lunch! My favorite is BLT, no mayo, add avocado--check out their soups, too! 

I had to drop two stars. They are so awesome to eat at but for the third time, my order has been wrong on to-go orders. I always pre-tip thus, this is the equivalent of taking back my \"tip\".  Fool me once... three times? C'mon! 

Bottom line. Don't leave until you check your order."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place! The small menu is great, the food is delicious, and the tea is incredibly refreshing. Love this place."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp after searching for a light breakfast/lunch before heading over to Paradise Valley Mall. 32 Shea is located in the middle of a barren shopping center a few blocks off the 51.

I went for the Early Bird Sandwich and a large cappuccino. The portion size was perfect, all of the ingredients tasted fresh, and it was priced well at $4.50. I loved the cappuccino, but next time I have to try the mocha with nutella.

Attention tea-drinkers: there is no black iced-tea, only green. My mom wanted black iced-tea, and had them make one of the premium loose-leaf black teas and pour it over ice. I'm not sure what the brand was, but the tea tasted amazing! A little expensive if you're used to standard iced black tea.

We ate on the patio with our pup. Nice ambience, you almost forget you're in the middle of a parking lot. If I lived closer, this place would become one of my regular breakfast spots."}
{"text":"My husband Michael and I are beyond thankful for this jewel of a restaurant in our neighborhood! It has truly brought life to our area. At the end of a long day, we look forward to meeting there at least 1 to 2 times a week. (in addition to breakfast and lunch at times) The food, as well as the service is amazing! We recommend it to everyone we know...Rebecca, Chef Teresa and the staff just finished restaurant week and it was fabulous! It was (and always is) a delicious \"date night!\""}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great to hit after hiking, perfect for lunch, and great for drinks after work.  Great food and service.  Love the patio seating area."}
{"text":"+ Atmosphere
++Coffee
+ Food 

A small little place with awesome patio seating. Unfortunately it does get crowded around the counter when you have to wait for your drink. Ample seating but I'm sure on busier days it can be a hassle since it is smaller. 

Food, um yum... I ended up getting the Lox Bagel, not super amazing but I was satisfied with how it tasted. I wish a little more cream cheese or salmon was on it because my first couple bites were just bagel. I really liked my Nutella latte though! It was delicious and had a nice hazelnut Nutella taste to it. I would love to come back and try more from their menu because it looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! This building was first a drive-thru photo mat in the 80's, then a coffeehouse and now an urban cafe. I love the cool designs and colors of the building itself. They have a great oasis patio area with trees for shade and misters during hot days. The modern hip feel of 32 Shea gives it a lot of energy and the place gets hopping during peak hours. The lobby area can get a little tight, but at the same time it's nice to feel up close to the people who are making the drinks. They are dog friendly and occasionally host dog adoption events. I got the New Mexico burrito and really liked the green sauce that came with it. My Iced Toddy was perfect to combat the warm weather outside. An enjoyable experience and I look forward to stopping in again."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but plan to be back! 

I had the OMG and all I can say is OMG. That was probably one of the best sandwhiches I've ever had IN MY LIFE! If I wasn't there on a date, I would have made out with it. I'm not scared to admit that. 

I also had a Mai Tai which was so good as well. Strong enough to be fun but not so strong so that you have to wait for the ice to melt. Maybe if I had a 3rd Mai Tai, I would have made out with the sandwhich. 

Would be nice though if the staff frequented the patio and took your order. Was kind of a buzzkill to have to go back inside and wait in line to get another drink."}
{"text":"I had the turkey apple brie bacon sliders and was greatly disappointed.  They had no flavor which is amazing since those toppings should be bursting with flavor. My husband said the same thing about the roast beef sliders.  Oh and the chips? Stale ruffles...just sayin."}
{"text":"Love 32 shea! I used to live by this location and it was a great go to! The people are very nice and the environment it super chill and a great place to hang out at! Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"We checked out 32 Shea for lunch way back when they opened...haven't been back in quite a while.  

Biggest gripe is the traffic flow while ordering - no matter where I stood, I was in the way of another customer or one of the workers - the 'dance' to stay out of the way got kind of old.

Other than that - great experience!

Got the beef sandwich with a side salad.  Side salad was mixed greens and the sweet and tangy dressing played nicely against the more bitter of the greens - good stuff.
The sandwich was nice.

The expanded patio is a pretty cool place to eat your lunch - and the way it was designed was really neat - liked the decor!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my new favorite spot! So cozy, comfy, and incredibly cute! My husband and I went for brunch Sunday. You order your food and drinks inside, pay and seat yourself in or outside. Stay to get your drink and food is served to you at your table. We got the Carmel Macchiato, and Nutella Coffee, both iced. Both very creamy and yummy. For breakfast we split both the OMG Sandwich (Prosciutto, fig, honey, and mascarpone) and the Tomato and Lox( w red onion, capers, cream cheese on and everything bagel). Also both very scrumptious!! 

The atmosphere was cozy and tranquil! Happy Bob Marly tunes played in the background. Friendly people and pets around. You've got to love the Buddha/Water/Succulents shrine! 

Tips: Try and know your order before you step in the door. It is very small inside and the staff is very busy and running in & out. 

If there are 2 of you one should order and another find a seat. 

If you have a dog they are welcome on the outdoor seating area and they have a place to get water for them. 

If you follow them on Facebook you can see what their daily dinner specials are!

They have happy hour from 6am-6pm plus daily specials like 20$ bruschetta & wine on Tuesdays!! Awesome!! 

All in all its a must try awesome spot and your supporting local business! What's not to love?!"}
{"text":"Best cheese cake I've ever had, hands down.

Funny enough, it has the coolest bathroom I've seen in a place. Turn out the lights!!"}
{"text":"What a cool place!  I stopped in this week for a hot tea and a bite to eat.  The staff was super friendly, the decor is quaint, the atmosphere is really relaxed and the food/drinks were amazing!  Can't wait to come back and check-out the pet friendly patio when it gets warmer."}
{"text":"We have been there twice now - once for breakfast and once for lunch... This place is the best, little corner dive!! The food is fast, healthy, inexpensive and delicious!! And you absolutely MUST try their green salsa. OMG."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm impressed.  I've driven by for over year and finally stopped at the drive-thru.  I have ordered the New Mexico Burrito which was the perfect combination of eggs, potatoes avocado and expertly done bacon - creamy, crunchy goodness.  I also tried the OMG which is the proscuitto, marscapone fig and honey. YUM!  The bread really is what makes it.  I'll be going back again and again to try more things on the menu. 
Glad to have such a great place nearby and a drive-thru!  Sure beats fast food chains for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"After my second experience with the rude owner of this establishment,. I will not be back, Buh-Bye"}
{"text":"32 Shea is a hidden gem located in the heart of Phoenix. Located at 32nd Street & Shea Blvd I've been coming to this cute little joint for a few years now! It's seriously the cutest cafe with an urban/hip feel. It's quite the oasis! I love their zen garden and outdoor patio they have! Super cute and cozy!! Their menu offers breakfast + lunch + dinner, happy hour, coffees/teas, cocktails, beers, wine, etc. 

Breakfast 
On my days off I enjoy coming here for breakfast instead of the usual ihop, Waffle House, or The Good Egg. Their mimosas are delicious and I enjoy getting their Early Bird Sandwich which comes on an English muffin with a perfectly cooked egg, tomato, avocado, mayo and you get to pick your meat! I have a sweet tooth so I also enjoy getting the Yummy in my tummy which is Nutella on a toasted bread with some sliced bananas. Also super tasty with strawberries too! Yummy!! I also LOVE their Nutella iced Mocha which I get most of the time or if I'm on a coffee run! 

Lunch
The OMG sandwich is one of my faves!! Comes with prosciutto, mascarpone cheese, figs, and honey. So yummy!! Their chicken raspberry salad is also a super popular menu option. The Granny Smith apples and vinaigrette ties it all together. 

Dinner
I absolutely love doing the bruschetta. You can pick 3 out of the few ones they have. I usually will do that for an appetizer and for my main course The Lobster Mac & Cheese or the open faced grilled cheese! They're both super simple dishes, but they add their little touch of flavor to make it even that more amazing!! Very indulging!

Desserts
I've had their Nutella cheesecake once and it's TO DIE For! It has mascarpone cheese filling with a Nutella topping and almond crust! 

Yes, they're a super small cafe, yes sometimes it takes a while to get food so this isn't the place to go if you're in a hurry! This is perfect for date night or brunch with the girls. Take advantage of the patio before it gets hot out and enjoy the ambience and AZ sunshine!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and absolutely loved the atmosphere.  Today was a little different I had an encounter with a rather rude staff member.  I had a few choice words for her but I didn't want to cause a scene.  Needless to say I most likely won't return to this place. To the ignorant white female with short stacked dark hair working the drive thru today do your job correctly next time, it's called customer service!"}
{"text":"SO CUTE!! Great coffee , great breakfast burritos and great environment. There is a little outside sitting area and it's very trendy. The bathroom is very fun as well"}
{"text":"The service here is non-existent.  We were seated 6 inches away from another table, after being told we couldn't sit at a different table, because there were only two of us and this particular table had 3 chairs. Then we waited for a long time for a server to come, which never happened.   Finally just got up and left.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Coffee quality is great! Capuccino with almond milk was excelent - no bitterness, that's usually comon for such bev. elsewhere. I tried Gluten free version of BLT from lunch menu. Very delish. Ouside garden is simple, but qute. It's simple hipster coffee place with friendly staff and quality coffee. 
One improvement suggestion: to put less sause on a side salad or serve it on a side.
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Meh  
Had lunch here and found to be ok but not remarkable.  Food quality was good. Atmosphere ok and enjoyed the outside patio.  It is very tight space wise inside.  The menu choices are of wide variety however after a sandwich and salad I left hungry.  My partner had the butternut squash soup and shared with me and I found that to be the highlight of the lunch visit.  Plan to bus your own table and order up front inside.  Not a bad place but with so many outstanding restaurants in the area unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Had the White Chocolate Mocha and Blueberry Muffin. Taste: Pretty Good.  Coffee Variety: Good. Breakfast Items: Fair.  Environment: Excellent if you like the coffee vibe! Overall: Great place to come for a cup of Joe!"}
{"text":"We are new to the neighborhood so checked them out for happy hour. It was so fun! Loved that the patrons all seemed to know each other, great food, service and atmosphere. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been there several times for lunch and the food has been consistently wonderful although their chips are a bit too salty for me.  The place is small but efficient, you see no waste of space.  Yes sometimes you get your own water and clean your own table- no big deal!  Outdoor seatings are great for Phoenix weather. Overall, It's cute and friendly.  Nothing luxurious but intimate space and modest establishment.   We need more places like this one here."}
{"text":"Yesterday was one of those days. After work, I told myself, \"B*tch, you need a drink!\" So I've been dying to try the Nutella Espresso Martini at 32 Shea...this drink is fantabulous! I had two along with a Chicken Raspberry Salad. Delicious. If it weren't for a group run later that same evening I would have stayed and tried a slice of the Nutella Mascarpone Cheesecake.

It's not even Noon and I'm craving a Nutella Espresso Martini -- give me strength Patron Saint of All Things Nutella!!!!"}
{"text":"Cool and cozy!  Great patio, great service and great food not to mention this place is dog friendly.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"It was an uncommonly rainy night when I met a friend here for dinner and drinks so the patio area was closed.  I was sad that I couldn't enjoy the patio because it was honestly the one thing that really drew me in from the photos I saw here from other yelpers.  The interior was as packed as a small place this could be.  At this point I'm a little unsure about staying, no patio and tight quarters. 

The staff was immediately very happy to see me and showed no signs they were at all put out by the weather.  

I ordred a beer and the pizza of the day.  The waitress tried to tell me what was on the pizza of the day but I really wanted to be surprised so I asked her to stop.  All she got out was \"it's called black and blue\".  I was told the beer I wanted wasn't in stock or going to be carried anymore so I said surprise me with a random beer that is similar.  They brought me one of my favorites so I was very happy with their choice.  The pizza took a lot longer to come out than I would have expected but I really didn't mind.  The atmosphere was so comfortable that had I not looked at the time I wouldn't have realized so much of it had passed.  

The pizza was great, I had fun figuring out why they called it Black and Blue and the waitress asked me if I had figured it out.  The blue cheese flavor wasn't overpowering nor was the blackened steak.  It was a very well balanced flavor over all and I enjoyed every bite.

I'm sure I'll be back so I can explore more of their menu and hopefully try out the patio area."}
{"text":"Talk about an angry owner complains about customers and employees in front of everyone extremely rude. Breakfast was meadioker. Employees are very nice and try to compensate for the owners rudeness.  She should stay behind the scenes maybe bookkeeping!"}
{"text":"I came here with my dog and my kid and sat on the nice and good patio. Very good place to relax and hangout for a long time. Their drink menu is very good too.
I went with my friend Susan who had the salad. We both thought this is good place to sit and talk and hangout on the dog friendly patio in Scottsdale
The Buddha patio was very good & zen. Very good"}
{"text":"Love the drive thru and gluten free bread. Got a chop salad and Turkey stack to go. Didn't have to get out of the car. One of the rare places that offers gluten free items in menu. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is such a cute little concept. The actual building is quite small but they have a larger patio area and a drive-thru. I've heard great things about it so I wanted to try it, I went around the lunch hour. I ordered the BLT with avocado and a side salad, it came on Chibatta bread which is one of my favorites, it was very good I just wish the bacon was a little bit less cooked so it wasn't quite so crumbly, it kept falling out of the sandwich. Otherwise very tasty. I also got a Nutella mocha which was amazingly decadent! I will definitely return, very quaint."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe/restaurant.  It's TINY yet the menu pretty much has pretty much everything you could want (espresso drinks, chai, breakfast, sandwiches, and more).  The decor is modern yet cozy, with plenty of large windows.  The people working there were nice.  The prices were very reasonable.  I enjoyed my veggie-tarian sandwich and appreciated that I was able to substitute whole wheat bread.  The only issue I had was the air-conditioning, specifically the seemingly total lack thereof.  Sure, there was a ceiling fan lazily spinning along, but in August in Phoenix it takes a lot more than that to keep a place bearable.  Just saying."}
{"text":"Terrific local coffee shop serving real coffees, espressos, plus great breakfast and lunch items. No Starbucks burned bean taste!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, cool place, highly recommend for lunch or an afternoon meeting place."}
{"text":"A work associate asked to meet at this place - I had never heard of it.  It's located in a somewhat deserted strip mall. It definitely stands out though, with it's vibrant colors and proximity to 32nd Street. It has a quaint patio, although you do get a bit of street noise. 

So... I met my associate and to my delight, they also had a full bar (including a great selection of vino). I think the coffee / bar concept is a great and unique one - definitely worth a visit.  The staff and owners were very friendly too.

Not sure about the food - only because I didn't order any."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and finally stopped by for check this updated coffee shop and I am so happy that I did. 
I had a latte with Almond Milk (yes, finally a place that has something more to offer than soy milk) which was delicious and I felt even better that knowing my dollars were going to a local business. 
Then I had to stop by today for lunch. The Le Grande Tuna sandwich was great. I had a lot of food for not a lot of $$ and it tasted great. 
I will be back and often, especially when they start serving dinner. 
Thanks 32 Shea. I am so glad that you are here."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! It is small but has so much character. The menu is small but the items on it are done very well. The staff is very friendly and I noticed that they knew several customers by name. It is very comfortable with seating at the bar, table or on the patio. It is a great place to swing by after work for a quick drink and convo or dinner. I could see riding my beach cruiser here on the weekends with my dog in tow for an app and drink in the patio. This is a great place and much needed in this area. Well done!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place:  the owner is awesome, the people are helpful, the food is very yummy, the cocktails are strong!  It's a great place during the day, too!  We so lucky to have 32Shea right in the neighborhood!!  Yaaaa 32Shea!"}
{"text":"This is the type of coffee shop that should have its own TV show. *******REAL BARISTAS WORK HERE****** only true coffee lovers understand the importance of that!! Food is delicious and fresh every time, the cocktails are great, Nina kicks a** in the morning and if you get a chance to sit at the bar be prepared for the free funnies!! #realneighborhoodgem"}
{"text":"I've been going here for over a year, every visit I am greeted with a smile and a conversation which goes really nicely with the fantastic coffee they whip up. I am from Australia originally and I have brought many Aussie visitors to 32 SHEA and they loved it. I will often get texts messages saying how they wish we could go grab an iced Nutella Mocha on the weekends! I love supporting non chain small businesses and 32 Shea is probably my favourite one to support in the Valley! :)"}
{"text":"I don't know if I'll be coming back. 

I got the early bird sandwich with turkey and it was slightly better than a chain breakfast sandwich. There wasn't much flavor and the egg was square... Like a microwaveable sandwich. 

The Bloody Mary was not my style either. Very thick (which I normally enjoy) and almost fishy. It sort of tasted like a shrimp cocktail. Definitely different if that's what they're going for.

I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the outdoor patio with colorful umbrellas, plants lining the fence, and a modern Buddha rain fountain with succulents around it.

The price is decent, the location is convenient, and the staff is kind of nice."}
{"text":"We love this place, morning, noon and night.  Although the food is always really good, the nighttime entre done by Chef Teresa is the best.  Although there is only one entre (as well as many other items that are sides or to be split) the imagination by Chef T makes the entre great.  Go local.  Go 32 Shea."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go a few times per week. Food is all awesome. Coffee is great. Breakfast lunch or dinner. Good drinks. Friendly service!"}
{"text":"They have a good New Mexico breakfast burrito... I love their verde salsa! BUT.... It takes AWHILE for a simple burrito. Not to mention that I came 1 min after breakfast ended and they wouldn't make it. Ok no big deal there is a reason for a time constraint but then the other two things I wanted weren't ready yet. Then another time a server forgot an entire sandwich and I had to go back. Decent prices but an extremely ditzy and not accommodating staff makes for a 3 star review."}
{"text":"Great little place tucked away on a corner parking lot. Very small inside but the fenced patio looks spacious. It is full of wonderful plants that shield eaters from the parking lot traffic and view of the strip mall. 
I went there for happy hour and tried their house Merlot and Cab wines as well as the tomato & fresh garlic bruschetta on french bread. Absolutely amazing! Their menu is avant garde and eclectic, with a nice selection of wine and beers. 
A must visit to experience all that this little place has to offer."}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times, but every time everyone here is so friendly. They have  a great happy hour, I had an excellent grapefruit martini for $6. The menu is small, but its all really good. I love their lox on gluten free toast. The patio is great for brunch and the evening."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Tucked away in a corner of North Phoenix,  the atmosphere is something one would expect from a downtown restaurant. They have a large,  open, dog-friendly patio, and simple but modern decor. A great place for a gathering,  a study day,  or a date."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times before. Food is just okay, and usually sounds like it would taste better than it actually does, but would rate food 6 out of 10.
The one star is for attitude and atmosphere, which caused us to leave without dining here tonight.

They advertise this place has a dog friendly patio, and we thought we'd take our dog with us (primarily because we were feeling a bit guilty with both of us working long hours).

When we arrived, the patio was full of diners except for one bar height table for six, which the host said he could clean for us. We were tired after working and really didn't want to go anywhere else with our small dog, so we agreed the high top table would be OK. (We debated this because our dog is very small, and their posted rules do not allow him to sit on the chair.)

After standing for a while waiting for them to finish cleaning and resetting the table, a woman brazenly yelled out to the waiter that she really wanted to eat on the patio, and although she was already seated at an open window table inside the restaurant, told the waiter she expected to be seated at that table outside. So, without a word of apology to us, the waiter gave her our promised table. Then, after the waiter seated the woman, the host said to us, \"the table is really big enough to share.\"  Share???  Who said we wanted to share?

Needless to say, after a long weekday of work, and with a dog in hand on leash who was also expecting to eat, we weren't looking to share a table for six or make dinner conversation with a  stranger.. So we said, \"thanks, but we weren't planning on dining communally tonight.\" Then left...disappointed, tired, hungry, and with dog in hand. 

I admit I'm not a fan of trendy communal dining, although I have nothing against it for those who may like it.  This, however, was not a communal table, but only a table for six.  This was also very poorly handled by both the waiter and host, and extremely presumptuous of the restaurant to expect two parties to be okay with sharing a high-top table for six without even asking either party's permission first."}
{"text":"Do go here for the atmosphere. Do go here for Happy Hour. Do go here for a tiny selection of yummy sandwiches and salad, and some signature drinks. 
Do not go here for consistency or remotely decent service. 
Every once in awhile you can get a smile and hello out of a server, don't count on it. 
I've watched countless newcomers arrive and not know how seating works so they stand around trying to find anyone who can help. Just last night I watched two servers and the owner walk past potential customers several times without so much as a nod or \"we will be right with you.\" and I won't even get into all the wrong orders dished out. 
Breaks my heart because I want this place to be as amazing as I keep hoping it will be. 
I give this place way too much of my business because I love the atmosphere and location. But I really don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that their Chai Thai Latte makes Starbucks looks like they're in training...and 32Shea should be their headquarters. (That's my full star). I was on my way to the burger joint just right across when I couldn't resist stopping by for a drink, simply because I've heard nice things about this place. I gotta say, the chai tea was cool... What was not cool was a boss who thought it was ok to nearly scold her employee in front of the patrons. A dirty floor does not look worse than a humiliated employee. This woman, which I am going to assume is the owner of the establishment thought it was acceptable to 'instruct' her employee how to clean the floor but could care less to use that same passion & fervor to tend to my order. The other employees said hello, but she didn't even bother. She took my money like if it was her right. Granted it was only 2 drinks but did that mean I deserved less? I actually saw servers bringing up food and drinks to all tables, and based on that alone I thought that was the norm for all orders, but when I finally realized the drinks were not coming I just got up to find them deserted at the counter. Not a call nor anything. I get very fustrated with this kind of service, specially when I am with friends, because when it's my turn, they trust I can pick a nice spot for a nice experience but at times It's embarrassing. I am just thankful I ordered my drink cold to begin with. My friend did not complain, so there was no fuzz over there, but seriously!"}
{"text":"The food was great! Came here for appetizers everything was amazing. I highly recommend their bruschettta, they were all amazing !!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Dinner, breakfast, coffee, lunch.... everything is delicious.  Service is fast and professional.  The Nutella mocha is my favorite!! The patio is peaceful and the bruschetta is perfect!!  I visit at least once every week and sometimes twice a day!!  Love!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, not expensive food. Simple menu but delicious food. Breakfast burrito is bomb! Haven't checked it out yet but apparently they have a full bar too."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE:
The people are very friendly and make you feel like you are a regular customer. The atmosphere is great. Quite frankly, this place seems a little out of place because the shopping center in which it is located is quite worn. In that sense, 32 Shea is like an oasis in the desert.

The owner was training 2 new people that day. So, things were a little slow. However, I was impressed with how they handled the lunch rush. They communicated well about the expectations, but I did not hear any excuses even when someone's order was incorrect (girl's 1st day). Still, they resolved the issue, and the guest seemed pleased with the resolve."}
{"text":"Glad I rediscovered this place. Conveniently off the 51 and on my way to work. Great location for Business meetings. Cozy vibe. Great music. Vined trellis fenced patio blocks some of the traffic views and exhaust. I had tropical iced green tea- delicious! They need some gluten free food options (I see many stopping in after workout or hike). I'm not one to take bathroom pics but got a kick out of their multicolored lighting effect! I'll be doing some writing here!"}
{"text":"Nice, hip little joint!   If you live nearby, please give it a try and support this great addition to the neighborhood.  If you live not so near, it's just a short hop off the 51at Shea and worth it!"}
{"text":"Love love love 32 Shea! I just tried their seasonal pumpkin pie spice latte with almond milk. Delicious!!!! I normally get the one from Starbucks, but after trying 32 Shea's for the first time yesterday it is my new favorite. They also have really good happy hour prices for food and drinks. The patio is super cute and really great when it is nice out. This place is great all around. Be sure to go check it out. :)"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try place for a while. It's a stone throw away from my old high school, Shadow Mountain, so I was happy to see a new restaurant breathe life into this strip mall. I've now gone twice in the last month and each time I've been pleasantly delighted. With the weather finally cooling down, their patio is nice and serene with trees and shrubs surrounding it.  For a brief moment you forget you are in parking lot. It's also nice that their patio is pet friendly as well. So on the first visit I got their OMG sandwich. Oh my was it good! It's a combination of Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Fig  and Honey. Need I say more ;) . On my second visit I got their tuna sandwich, the tuna salad was good. The only thing I wish is that they could offer another type of bread besides Ciabatta, since it seemed like the bread to tuna salad ratio was a little off. Other than that I'm a firm believer in local businesses and I hope this one continues to thrive!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch for the first time on 7/26. There were 6 of us. When we arrived at 10am, there was only one other table seated. We all ordered - my husband and I both ordered the breakfast burrito without bacon as we are both vegetarian. Time passed and everyone received their food except us. Our friends wanted to wait, but after about 10 mins we insisted they eat, as their food was getting cold. Another table seated 10 mins after we arrived also ordered two burritos, and received their food while we were still waiting. We asked the server multiple times and were told they were on the way. We think maybe they got ours by mistake. 50 minutes later (after the other table had eaten and left a while ago) our meal was finally delivered. At that point, everyone else at the table had finished their meals. My husband and I are both vegetarians - he took a bite and got a mouthful of bacon. We sent them back and then had to wait another 15 minutes for our meal and ended up getting them to go. All in all, we waited for a total of 65 minutes for 2 burritos with eggs and potatoes.  We were really hungry at that point, but neither of us liked the burritos, finding them bland. At no time were we offered any compensation for the error and only received one rushed apology - the server said the kitchen was really busy (but as we were the second table there after a 2-top,  our order should have gone in before the rush). As a former server, I was appalled at the lack of customer service and empathy when, not only did we wait a ridiculous amount of time for a simple dish, but the dish was not made correctly and violated our diet. Thank goodness it was not something more serious like a food allergy. I understand that things happen and would have given them 2 stars (they have great coffee) but no one working there seemed to really care. Needless to say, we will not be returning to 32 Shea."}
{"text":"Love it here and the ambiance is quite charming and cozy! Love starting my day with their rosemary honey latte and for lunch all of their sandwiches are delish - especially the roast beef and the OMG. Happy hour is great with different options each day - my favorite being the wine and bruschetta! This place is close to my office and home so I love bringing clients here for a quick meet over coffee, lunch or happy hour - sometimes I'm here twice in one day! The service is great and the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Just came back Arizona after a long time in California and the only thing I want is my \"Shea 32\" 
Used to be there all time 
It's a cool local restaurant/coffee place with nice food 
They are dogs lovers so me and my dogs go there a lot 
The 4 starts is bc most of them are super nice but one server is not friendly everytime I go
A cool place in the middle of no where"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The happy hour specials on brochettes keeps me coming back. Seriously Brie honey and apple? Yes please! They also over a great selection of local beers. The ambiance on the patio is great, complete with an eclectic selection of music."}
{"text":"Great coffee and fantastic baked goods and pastries!"}
{"text":"I had a green smoothie and the turkey cranberry sandwich for lunch. It was very good and tasted fresh. Might be one of the best smoothies I've had!!"}
{"text":"Such a cool experience. The food was amazing, the drinks were amazing. It gives of a small town coffee shop feel and a sophisticated semi-busy black tie restaurant feel at the same time. The mood completely changes at night, in the best way possible. As soon as the sun goes down you can really feel the black tie aesthetic come out. Not the type where you feel like you have to dress nice and act perfect, but the type where you feel like you're the boss of a big business and you're meeting with a similar successful colleague. Boom."}
{"text":"Finally a first rate coffee and sandwich shop at this location.  After years of mediocre coffee shops at this stand alone location a real stand out!  The entire place has been redecorated and updated in a contemporary urban 21st century design.

The indoor seating is limited, but there is plenty of outdoor seating available.

The shop is promoting evening wine and beer and a dog friendly patio - not sure of the concept?

The coffee prices are reasonable between $2.50 and $4.00.  Breakfast fare and sandwiches are available for well under $10.00.

The place looks great.  I live nearby and am happy to see this new establishment brighten up the hood!"}
{"text":"Adding another 5 star review to this little place.  It's hard, in a town like Phoenix, to find a neighborhood spot. 32 Shea is it.  Great place for breakfast and a good cappuccino, but even better for a cocktail and a bruschetta at the cocktail hour.  

They've recently renovated the patio which now has a Morrocan/bohemian feel with brightly covered umbrellas and funky brass lighting, Toss in a very dog-friendly patio and awesome custom service (they know how I like my cocktail without being reminded which tells you how often I go/embarrassing) and you can not beat it.

The prosciutto bruschetta is sublime."}
{"text":"I found this place on the Local First Arizona website and 32 Shea is quickly becoming both my local hangout and my stop for an afterwork cocktail.
I really love this place - especially their outdoor patio. The way that the owners have worked to convert an old photomat into a spot of relaxation and good vibe is amazing. It's small but I've always been able to get a table and their outdoor patio is dog friendly.

I've been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and all three have been a good experience. They even have a drive-thru for coffee in the mornings. For breakfast, I like the egg-white bites. Their flatbreads change daily and they also do some specials during the week that my family enjoys like burgers and milkshakes.

Their cocktails are innovative and delicious and its a great relaxing spot for connecting with friends after work.

There was recently a fundraising campaign for an elderly gentleman in the area and when I went on the website to make a donation, I saw that 32Shea had made a generous contribution for this man. This is the type of business that I want to support."}
{"text":"This place is really cute....pretty close quarters to be honest. I was happy to see a bar on our first visit. We sat down with mimosas on the brain. The staff was buzzing behind the little bar, people saw us, but not one \"hello\" or \"how can we help you guys\". One of the chicks working told us, \"we don't have waiter service during the day so you have to come to the iPad to order\". How were we supposed to know? I thought she was a little rude and the fact that no one greeted us didn't feel like a very  \"friendly neighborhood hangout\".  That being said the burrito I ordered was delicious and my boyfriends meal was yummy too (the early bird sandwich).  I have been back and the food is really yummy and consistent. It seems pretty popular and we will be spending more time there.  The only reason I knocked off a star was because of our initial few steps in the door on our first time."}
{"text":"I am so glad my friend took me here on a whim. You could drive by it daily and never know this little gem you're missing. Excellent atmosphere with a killer pandora station playing. The food and cocktails were outstanding and well crafted. The service was perfect. Check out the bathroom- it's a total trip. I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming my very favorite restaurant in the Phoenix metro area...what a gem! The service is friendly. The food is phenomenal. The atmosphere any time of day is warm and inviting whether it's crowded or a little on the slow side. The Nutella hot chocolate is a must...best in the valley by far. Try any one of their sandwiches, their variety of bruschetta creations, and the lobster mac and cheese. Just typing this review is making me hungry! :-)"}
{"text":"Very cool little place.  All of these years my husband and I thought this was just a coffee shop and were surprised that they had survived.  Last night we were on yelp looking for a wine bar and this came up so, questioning whether it was categorized correctly, we stopped in.  Wonderful intimate atmosphere, nice patio, a unique menu for both food and spirits.  The reason for the lack of stars, they were out of the wine we wanted, the second choice was a light beer and they only have those rich beers. When I decided on a cocktail, they offered a Jalapeño margarita on their website so I inquired to find they don't make them anymore because people complained they were too hot. She did however offer to make one if they had jalapeños which was nice. I went for the mint lemon drop martini to keep it safe.  Very good!  I ordered the chopped chicken salad.  It was large And came with generous amounts of bacon.  SOLD me right there. My husband ordered roast beef sliders which were delicious.  The service was a bit slow but we weren't in a hurry and they advertise that they take time for preparation.  Everyone around us seemed relaxed and really enjoying themselves!  I would definitely go back.  Oh, and their happy hour looked very decent."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I really liked the coffee, the food was okay. We both ordered a Nutella mocha and New Mexico burrito. The mocha was delicious and good either hot or iced. The burrito was pretty basic, nothing special. I really enjoyed the patio area. It had a really homey feel to it. The wait for the food wasn't too bad either considering it was slightly busy at the time we went which was around 9:30. I will consider going back for the coffee."}
{"text":"I hate to do this, 32 Shea has been a favorite of mine for a long time, but our last two visits have been a total disappointment.  I get when a restaurant doesn't choose to offer gluten free options, it's extra work for the kitchen and it's more expensive and that's fine.  But when gluten free options are offered, the kitchen needs to get it right.  Too much is riding on it.  32 Shea started offering gluten free bread for its sandwiches about a year ago and at first it was great!  The staff was careful and my beloved stacked turkey was fabulous!  Lately though, the bread has been burnt or so cold it's obvious my sandwich was made first and left to sit while the rest of the order was assembled.  The sandwich has been missing avocado or had lettuce I had requested left off.  Today was a deal breaker.  The kid at the cash register couldn't have been out of high school and although I asked him to repeat my order, it came out on regular bread (45 minutes after I ordered it!).  The person who brought it to me told me that the gluten free bread wasn't on the order, but she did take it back.  My husband was done with his sandwich, his muffin, and his coffee by the time my order finally came back...with no avocado and with lettuce I had specifically asked left off.  Look, I know I'm picky, I really have to be, but I try hard to be nice about it and I tip well!  Come on, 32 Shea!  I don't want to give up on you!"}
{"text":"I love the Nutella mochas and breakfast burrito. Staff are always friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming. They have a nice outdoor seating area. At night this turns into a 4-star restaurant with wait-service and a skillfully crafted menu created new each day."}
{"text":"Love the drinks and food and of course the outside patio! The \"The omg\" is my favorite thing on the menu"}
{"text":"My pregnant wife and daughter each got food poisoning at 32 Shea this morning. The food poisoning was almost certainly Staph (Staphylococcal) which the CDC says this about, \"People who carry Staph can contaminate food if they don't wash their hands before touching it. Staph can also be found in unpasteurized milk and cheese products.\""}
{"text":"This is my favorite local coffee shop. Staff is generally friendly, the place is really well put together and it's just an overall great atmosphere. The food can take a little bit to come out but I am satisfied by what they produce. I recommend the caprese sandwich, it's a long time favorite of mine."}
{"text":"I'm currently working on getting in contact with the owner to change the name of this establishment to \"JESUS CHRIST\" due to the fact I exclaim that after each bite of their delicious culinary delights .  The menu item in particular I am referring to is the OMG!  I never thought OMG would be something I would say on the regular or even adapt into my daily vocab but this sandwich could be called a \"shit sandwich\" and I would still rave about it.  So basically no matter how dumb the name is the sandwich, its glory overshadows that.  The OMG for those who don't know is \"Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Fig + Honey\" now what that does is create a flavor explosion in your mouth similar to a pinata but less violent and more delicious.  I cant speak for breakfast or dinner items yet although the \"Crispy Lavosh Pizza of the Moment\" catches my eye cause I love that its named that, I will be going back to try more items.  The only reason I gave this place 4 instead of 5 stars is the coffee was good but didn't blow me away, I blame that on people building it up too much but that OMG sandwich will either change your life or save it, get it now!"}
{"text":"I love this place! This building has been a coffee shop for years and years and this is the best incarnation yet. Great neighborhood, good selection, awesome coffee shop and now a wine bar too. Ambience is relaxing, I love all of the plants. They have a fantastic patio, but inside is great too. Good music playing with a great atmosphere. The dog friendly patio is another plus!"}
{"text":"So me and my boyfriend live down the street and we LOVE coming here especially for there $20 dollar bruschetta and bottle special. The other night we came in, got our wine and enjoyed the beautiful scenery and relaxing music; we lost track of time and ordered another drink several minutes after they closed. The servers didn't even hesitate and gave us another glass even though they were about to close. I'd have to say there sincerity and kindness was much appreciated and we will continue to come and enjoy theM and YOU should tooo!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee (thanks barista Jeff), delicious food, yummy drinks (thanks bartender Josh), and super awesome staff (thanks Becca). 32 Shea is a hidden gem located in front of a very empty strip mall. They have indoor seating as well as a nice dog friendly :) patio that I can't wait to enjoy as the weather is finally starting to cool off. The owner and employees have put a lot of love into this local coffee shop/cafe and I hope for its continued success!"}
{"text":"Happy hour here is one word: GLORIOUS!  The $5 wine and their gimlet make me smile. The spinach artichoke dip is way too delicious to be fair. Although my thighs say no, I can not avoid that dip. The nutella cheesecake completely rocks my world and brings me joy. The place is deceiving from the outside as it is tiny and in the parking lot of a strip mall. However, don't be deceived. Relax on the patio and enjoy all that 32 Shea has to offer."}
{"text":"Really close to me, so had to try.  Last place here was only so so.  These guys rock!  Now a few times a week stop for me....great drinks and innovative food choices.  I hope they add live music on the patio!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot located in a small shopping center.  Nice cafe menu -- had the chicken raspberry salad, but subbed with their tuna -- excellent.  Patio area is comfortable and perfect for that sunny day.  Nice selection of bottled beers and other beverages."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood coffee/wine bar/restaurant. Roast beef sandwich is scrumptious. Comfortable and unassuming meeting place serving an eclectic menu and very good coffee. Food is consistently good and reasonably priced. The drive-thru window is a boon when you're in a hurry!"}
{"text":"No stars for the air conditioning in 32 Shea. I was sweating like the day I got married throughout my visit.
The beer selection is limited, but if you like a good pilsner, they serve Grand Canyon which is a fairly decent brew. I paired it with the bruschetta. 

Upon entering, you'll marvel at their ingenuity....getting fifteen or so tables to fit in a space smaller than a Catholic confessional. Kudos to you guys. I felt like we were all part of a human sweat-lodge experiment.

My server was friendly, and patronizing. I like that. 
\"You're cute\" will get you a nice tip. I'm not cute and I know it. So did everyone else at our little table when eyebrows raised, signaling she's out of her fucking mind. 

If you don't mind being pressed nuts to butts with strangers, I strongly recommend this place if for no other reason than to try their bruschetta combo plate. It's divine.

Four solid stars for someone telling me I'm cute. 
If she only knew, I'm shallow too."}
{"text":"Great food, and nice small place to chill out. Not a large setting, but who needs a giant lobby to get some good grub!"}
{"text":"lemme tell ya this, I had some high expectations with this place. beautiful patio space that puts off a great vibe and a friendly environment. i was impressed with the menu when it was first presented to us and decided to get the green smoothie. once we watched them make them was when it went downhill... it was just green machine naked juice blended into a smoothie! this was a disappointment quickly followed by what we thought to be microwaved eggs in our burritos. on top of this, staff went out of their way to use \"hip\" lingo to the point where I felt uncomfortable and needed to step outside. Only thing redeeming the spot was the cashier with the white framed glasses, she was absolutely gorgeous. Not all heros wear capes !"}
{"text":"Their breakfast sandwiches were piping hot and yummy! Loved sitting on the patio, service was quick and the vibes were very relaxing. Healthy eating with lots of options."}
{"text":"Been here twice and it is always good.  Not a huge choice on the menu, but everything on it is good. The atmosphere is comfortable/cozy and the service is good!"}
{"text":"This little spot is charming! Great little patio to dine with furry friends! The food is wonderful! We had several goodies! I had the OMG sandwich and it's on keeping with its name...cause you do think OMG this is delicious!! Friend had salad that looked fresh and pleasing! Another had the tuna salad which made me jealous it looked so yummy!! The staff was friendly and helpful as well! Give it a try....you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"My favorite little restaurant around my neighborhood! The best turkey sandwich EVER (turkey stack). The staff always greets us Sunday morning when we come grab our usual!  Mocha is great too!"}
{"text":"Met some friends for Happy Hour. Great food and they have a dog-friendly patio.  The service is also amazing.  Someone is always making sure you have water or checking to see if you need anything.  We had the sliders, hummus and spinach dip all of which were delicious."}
{"text":"Deceptively delicious!  This interesting little place looks like an off brand drive thru coffee shop at first glance, but oh no!! When you go in (bike and pet friendly) you find a great outdoor dining space small bar and a small dining room.  The sandwiches and salads are amazing. Eclectic crowd, interesting decor. Think hipster cool. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I've been going pretty regularly for over a year and a half. Here's what I think:

PROS: 
- The quality of food and drinks is vastly superior to any other coffee place you'll find in this area. They have very a very creative coffee drink selection.
- The New Mexico breakfast burrito is a revelation. The salsa that comes with it is inspired.
- Every cocktail, wine and lunch/dinner item I've ever had has been great.
- The was once a young guy who worked there in the morning that was sweet and wonderful and totally brightened my day. 

CONS:
- I get a ton of attitude from almost everyone that works there, despite the fact that I tip 20% or more every time I come. I generally feel like a burden to them. Depending on who comes to the window when I pull up, sometimes I'll just order a regular coffee because I think it will be quicker and less burdensome.
- There is something about their regular coffee that  is just WAY too acidic for me. I ask for a dark roast, but it doesn't taste anything like a dark roast. It is so acidic that I often question whether someone could have actually slipped lemon juice into the coffee.
- Too many times, they have not gotten my order right. They have given me the wrong muffin several times and just generally don't give me what I ask for. For example, today I ordered an americano with an inch of almond milk in it. I would never expect anyone to measure exactly, but I can tell you they put less than a tablespoon of almond milk in there and no where near an inch, leaving me with an overwhelmingly lemony, acidic americano that I'm just barely choking down now.

This place has a lot of great qualities, but ultimately, I'm tired of paying and tipping just so they can get my order wrong and treat me like a piece of trash."}
{"text":"This little coffee shop off of Cactus and the 51 freeway is similar to finding a ring in a Cracker Jax box. It's totally unexpected. The surrounding area is so \"ho hum\" and almost sketch, you would never think you would find a cute coffee hangout. There is a small patio area surrounded by greenery and small tables perfect for conversation. The benches against the fence have colorful square pillows lining the entire back and umbrellas provide perfect shade for midday sun. The ambiance is peaceful and inspiring.

Indoors is a little darker and more intimate setting since the shop is not as spread out as the patio. There were sandwiches available and some pastries to accompany whatever coffee you may enjoy. I tried a dirty chai latte. Although I asked for it cold, I received a hot one, but I didn't bother to have him change it, because I didn't really care one way or another. It was really good! I am just curious to have it cold next time. Or maybe I'll try the pumpkin latte... They had quite a few choices and the menu was very clear on their chalkboard overhead. The staff is really friendly and talkative as are the people who seem to be regulars here. There is really nothing bad to be said about this place at all, except for that one minor mistake. I do plan on returning again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Randomly read about this place on Yelp and I'm glad I was able to check it out! The hummus was EXCELLENT and my food (Turkey Burger Sliders) were as expected, though nothing to write home about. My friend had the Open-Faced Grilled Cheese and after having a tiny taste I wish I would have gone with that instead. 

The staff was very friendly and communicated continously about the timing of our food and beverages, which I always appreciate. I will definitely be back again! 

Just a tip... when you have specials \"moments\" that change daily, maybe limit it to one or two. Our server read off, I believe, three and I could barely wrap my head around what she said before she proceeded with the next item. If you do have multiple options it would've helped to had a visual reference to review."}
{"text":"The place itself is really cute and the ambiance is just right- however, the wine is questionable and the food is not great. I explained that I am primarily vegetarian, although I eat some fish on occasion. They recommended a salad on the menu and when I got it, it had bacon- that was not cool. I could not stand to see the pigs body thrown in the trash, so I ate it- but it was not good and I did not feel good afterwards."}
{"text":"32 Shea-Yay!!!
Love this place. Great atmosphere and we've had nothing but great service during both lunch and dinner. 
Everything was great but the creamy artichoke and spinach dip is amazing. The caprese salad was also delicious."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  Great food, great drinks, great ambiance and locally owned. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here this afternoon, I did not like the girl that helped us she was just arrogant. I had never been here before and she treated us like we were stupid,   I had the Turkey stack and it was good however I did get a black curly hair on my plate under my sandwich, kind of lost appetite after that. I had to serve myself out of the water jug on bar and water was room temperature, its 97 degrees outside can I at least get some ice? No one came to ask us how things were?! No customer service what so ever. I probably will not be back!"}
{"text":"It is rare to find a drive-through that actually serves healthy food. Thank you, 32 Shea, for bringing fast and nutritious food to those in a hurry in the north Phoenix area.

I've never actually ordered food from the drive-through myself, but every time I've observed a sale, it seems to be delivered quickly. The menu consists of coffee drinks (and a full bar, though alcohol can't be ordered from your car), as well as salads and sandwiches and a daily soup. With the sandwiches, you get a side of chips or a side salad. I've always gotten the salad, but I prefer swapping the house vinaigrette with ranch. As for the sandwiches, the veggie sandwich, which comes with cream cheese, tomatoes and greens, is tasty - just go light on the greens, unless you'd like a second salad on your sandwich.

32 Shea has a lot going for it - a really cute patio with comfy seating, and eclectic design inside that creates a funky, relaxing ambiance. I really like the restaurant has a bar area. The space can be anything you want - eatery, coffeehouse, bar, patio, or drive-through -- which is awesome.

Every time I've dined in for lunch, though, ordering has been an awkward experience. The ordering space is tiny, barely fitting two people comfortably, while anyone else is left to hover over them as they order. It'd be nice to just be able to pick a spot to sit down, then have a server come and take your order. The crampedness of the front ordering space is not a fun way to start your meal."}
{"text":"Really good food, great ambience. Had the lobster mac n cheese and the special - pasta with mussels. They were both excellent!
One thing though is service was super slow.  So bring your patience."}
{"text":"What a great spot in the middle of a strip mall parking lot. I love the simplicity of the menu. We had great service and good food and wine. The price point is right. If I lived closer I'm sure it would become one of my regular stops. 
The outside patio is adorable and comfortable. Server and bartender were friendly and knowledgable and not the least bit stuck up - which can happen easily in a trendy place like this."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last night for early dinner and wine. Really cute outdoor patio and food was good. Liked it so much, I can back the next morning for breakfast and a Nutella mocha. The drive thru is a little bit of a wait....but I'm just happy they have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Here from out of town . Found this place on yelp. Great ambience! Awesome mimosas and Very Friendly staff. A+ all around."}
{"text":"Order a stacked turkey, but didn't get turkey... very disappointing, especially after waiting 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Loved this new spot!! Tuesdays they have 1 bottle and Bruschetta plater for 20...hummus is to die for. cute spot with great music and outside patio is nice must check out."}
{"text":"Great coffee and deliciously inexpensive breakfast with prompt service in a relaxed neighborhood hangout. Doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"Cute small place ! Love the vibe ! Very laid back and we had a great dinner ! The honey, Brie, apple bruschetta is yummy yum yum ! I had the raspberry chicken salad for dinner , also very yummy ! Over all a great place for a low key, nice dinner :)"}
{"text":"Great change from the chain restaurants. Small but cozy atmosphere, 
Great patio, Great menu for wine & cheese, sliders are the best! Had a FUN relaxing time and great food. The patio seating has lots of green and umbrellas to hide the other businesses. We will be back Stephanie!
Tks"}
{"text":"Came hear a few times when previous owner was here and thought concept was great and product excellent.  New owners have kicked it up a notch as to hospitality. Kudos"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fantastic cocktails, and a killer patio. One of our favorites in the Valley! Their bruschetta is awesome on happy hour, and the New Mexico Burrito is my favorite breakfast item!! A must-try place!"}
{"text":"READ THIS FIRST:  If you are looking for a high volume, quick place to get a massive quantity of coffee, and a huge indoor space to stretch out and sit for hours using their WiFi, this is NOT the place for you.  

For the past 2 years my husband and I drove past the little place at 32nd Street and Shea wanting to try it.  However, we were addicted to the green mermaid and her infinite helpings of caffeinated drinks.  We could get in and get out without much interaction from the staff or clientele.  After speaking to several people who work in the area, we decided to stop in one Saturday morning for a mini-date.  It was the best choice we've made with regards to restaurants in a very long time.  

This place is small, dark and cozy, with an eclectic menu, music, vibe, and customer base.  Now, reading other reviews, we noticed that there was a common theme: people who sat themselves and waited for employees.  When you enter the establishment, there is a bar and cashier where all ordering is done.  No one will come to your table with a menu.  When we entered we were greeted immediately.  The menu is behind the bar, so we stood checking out our possibilities.  The space is small, so people patiently wait in line inside and outside.  We ordered the Mexican Burrito, the Croissant Sandwich, and the green apple and brie danish to split.  The burrito was flavorful, as was the croissant sandwich.  But the green apple and brie danish blew our socks off.  We had two drinks: the hot mocha and a cold white chocolate mocha and lavender freezachino.  Yes, I said lavender.  It is an incredibly refreshing summer drink.  

We sat ourselves and waited for our food.  The restaurant was about half full with regular patrons whom the owner and staff greeted by name.  Within a half-hour it was packed. People sat both inside and on the outside patio.  When the customer migration slowed, we had a chance to talk to the owner.  We complimented her food and ambiance.  32 reminds us of some of the coffee places we stop at in San Francisco:  great food, great vibe, great people, all local.

The second time we came for lunch.  We ordered the Le Grande Tuna and the Juicy Roast Beef.  Both great sandwiches, but the roast beef is now a favorite.  It is a warm roast beef with melted Munster cheese, creamy horseradish sauce on a Ciabatta roll.  To die for!  I had the lavender white mocha again and my husband had the caramel freezachino.  So far we can say  we have not been disappointed with any of the food or drinks.  The coffee never tastes burnt!  I can't say that about other places.  They have a local roaster where they get their coffee and he does a fantastic job.  This time we sat at the bar.  There were 4 or 5 of us.  Pretty soon we were all talking to each other and the wait staff.  Human interaction?  Who knew it could be that good?

We are now regulars.  We have realized that there are limitations to the order and serving process, simply because of the size of the establishment.  Once you get past that, you will realize what a little gem this is.  32 also has a drive through.  It is nothing to see 2 cars patiently waiting for some one to run their order out.  I think the key word is PATIENCE.  If you want something quick and snappy, please don't punish this place with your bad review.  The second word to consider is LOCAL.  If you want the quick menus with prepackaged food, move on.  The food is really good and meant to be enjoyed. Why only 4 stars, we have not tasted everything on the menu nor have been there in the evening. Also, it is tiny.  I can't really fault them though for that.   When we return for an evening date and finish the menu, I will gladly switch my rating.**

So, sit down, relax and stay a while.  Order first though and be reminded that good things come to those who wait.

**Added 8/2013  Yesterday was my birthday.  With the least amount of personal detail, I shall say that I have a history for sucky birthdays. I have come to avoid them as much as possible.  For this birthday, however, we were going to start a new tradition and try make them better.  I began my day at 32.  Once again, the food was fabulous.  The honey, apple and brie danish causes me to have cravings even now.  What made me change my star count wasn't the meal itself, but what I experienced.  Barista Luke first greeted me with a big  \"Happy Birthday!\"  Apparently, my husband told him the day before and he remembered.  Then, as we were leaving the owner, Rebecca, and Barista Paul came out from behind the counter and gave me a great big birthday hug.  I was so touched. Two of my siblings failed to contact me on my birthday, but I got a group hug at 32.  These people have become my friends. They watch out for me.  The know my children. Every meal is filled with greetings, good conversation and friendly banter.  The food is great, but the people are amazing!  If that's not worth a 5th star, I don't know what does."}
{"text":"A tad disappointed with my experience. There were some pros and cons, but I'd be down to give it another try. 
The restaurant is super tiny! But very cute, I love the patio area too. The bar area and decor is neat and I really liked that aspect of 32 Shea. There were some bugs flying around inside which was gross but the doors were open, not anyone's fault or anything ha.
We were seated pretty quickly. Our server informed us that it was his first night serving, and I totally wouldn't have known if he didn't say anything, because he did an excellent job! 
The menu looked to have some good options on it. The bruschetta caught my eye because there were so many kinds, and they're $3 each which I think is pretty reasonable because they are big. I ordered 3 and it was a good amount. I got one with tomato,
mozzarella, and basil, one with Brie, apples, and honey, and one with Gorgonzola with figs. Generally they were pretty good but not great, I thought there was too much bread. My favorite was the tomato mozzarella basil one. Though the middle of the bread was completely soggy with balsamic. The Gorgonzola fig one was my least favorite, too much cheese and not enough figs, the cheese was too strong to have so much on there. The brie apple honey one was in the middle, there wasn't enough Brie, but it was pretty good and I liked it. My sister got turkey burger sliders and she did not like them very much, said they made her feel sick. We also got spinach and artichoke dip which we all liked! My mom liked her salmon salad as well. So I'm glad I tried this place, but I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be!"}
{"text":"I think it's an Arizona pandemic - crappy owners who employ awesome staff. 

Exceptional environment. I mean, they nailed the coffee shop/mid-tier restaurant theme with zeal. The outdoor patio is an oasis in the barren, skid-mark stained landscape, known as Phoenix. 

The staff are stunning. Energetic, enthusiastic, engaging, informative, very talented. Great mixology, great cappuccino, great latte art, great integration of figs into so many culinary delights. 

So what's the issue with this place. Straight up, the owner. I think her name is Rebecca? You'll know you're talking to the owner because she's the one who's stressed out, operating in a state of chaos, rude to her staff, rude to customers, and overall, just very short & unfriendly. I don't know if her posture and attitude is intentional or not, but it affects the customer experience in the most unfortunate ways. Like a ripple in water, it affects the entire lake. 

We have had groups there, we have taken our closest friends, my wife and I have gone and worked there for several hours on our laptops pounding out work, we have recommended it to so many people in our massive network - and without question, when the owner is there, everyone who has experienced it, agrees that the owner is detrimental to the success of the customer service experience. 

An example? I listened to her chastise one of her employees in front of other customers for letting my wife and I sit at a 4-top inside. The employee tried to explain that we had been there for a coupe of hours and had spent well over $50 in our time there, but she did not have time to hear it. She approached out table, asked if we wanted a refill, and told us that if they needed the table they would be asking us to leave/relocate. Very abrupt with resting bit#h face the entire time. 

We suggested that we would be happy to move outside, but recognized that the outside was the most popular place for her customers, so we opted to stay indoors to alleviate taking her most popular seats. She suggested we go sit on the dilapidated outdoor couch (out of sight, out of mind so it seemed.)

I grew up in the restaurant business. My father has owned and operated many casual and fine dining establishments. I have worked FOH & BOH in my early days. I understand restaurant ethics and expectations well, and it's not that she was even wrong in her desire to have us relocate to accommodate a larger group, if one showed up - it's that her delivery was so retched, that it steered us out the door shortly there after. We felt unwanted & undervalued as customers because she choose to operate with a lack of socially acceptable communication (both verbal & non-verbal) skills. It's very unfortunate. 

As a former corporate executive of a 500+ employee organization, and now multi-business owner, I would deeply encourage the owner to take note of this review. Hire staff for their expertise, train them on your expectations & policy, and then give them the slack that they need to do what it is that they do best, their jobs. Leadership is not a position or a title, it is action and example. For 32 Shea, after reading so many other customer reviews that validate our experiences, I would recommend the immediate decapitation of owner/customer interactions. 

Here's hoping things change. Maybe if we know the owners schedule, we can plan our visits around when she'll be there? That seems ideal for now, because I've got lots of money to spend at local, owner operated coffee shops - but 32 Shea ain't gonna be one of them as long as this woman continues to employ the \"No Fu#!s to Give\" customer service approach to business ownership. ;)"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Phoenix! Small and intimate with a beautiful dog friendly patio. The staff is so nice and helpful. They always have the highest excellence of coffee and pastries. Love all the Staff here. Such a comfortable great place :) My favorite is their Carmel macchiato!! Oh and they have almond milk!"}
{"text":"Great for happy hour or coffee! Either way a great spot in the neighborhood for quality food and drinks! Their patio is very private and dog friendly.  The inside is kinda small so it's a great place for when the weather is great!"}
{"text":"After driving past this place so many times and not even noticing it.  A  friend invited me to join them for a cup of joe, stating \"you have to try 32 Shea, they have the best coffee ever!!\"  

I'm glad to say I found it and I've been back a couple of times since.  I'm not a fan of how they are set up with the order counter right at the front door, so when a lot of people are wanting a caffeinated beverage they have to squeeze in or wait outside.  

The place is nicely decorated in everything IKEA, if you like that their stuff.  The service is OK, a bit stretched a times and could use more help to handle the rushes but they are very friendly bunch of baristas.

The coffee is A-OK.  Better than at most \"chain type\" of places but not at the 4 or 5 star level."}
{"text":"I understand being busy but worst place ever. First asked for lemon 3 times for water. Then spilled a glass of water which the waiter saw but offered no napkins or help in cleaning up. Never refilled the water. After 45 minutes we finally asked about our food to be told their iPad went down and our order was never put in. As a server you should notice food not out for 45 minutes. Nothing was offered to make up for this and they just let us leave. No apologies or anything. A server forgets to put our order in then lies about it and we are out the time and leave starving. Very disappointed and will not ever be back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for sometime.  Today was the day and I was very pleased with what I found.  I ordered a chicken salad with bacon, egg and avocado with a balsamic dressing. The price was less than most places charge so when it arrived I was shocked to see that it had a lot of bacon not just a few bits a large slice of avocado as well as half a boiled egg. 
The patio was small but very well shaded and I look forwarded to going back and trying their dinners as well as the happy hour."}
{"text":"i love this place. i had a \"dirty\" chai tea latte... yum! and i am not a big chai fan too. why did i order it? i dunno. 

had the fig/proscuitto sandwich aka the OMG ... which is exactly what it was. the proscuitto is cured in garlic? and the combo of figs and i believe mascarpone... mind blowing. HUUUUGE fan! and their hours are quite impressive, considering phx businesses propensity for closing when the sun goes down.

the only downside... i now live in Tempe. but still worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Very cute and decent food but the employees are rude every single time, without fail. I don't know where management finds these clowns but they are always rushed, sassy, and bothered by the fact that you're ordering from them. Go home and take a nap and come back when you're ready to work and provide customer service! I live right across the street and would prefer to drive out of my way to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Seriously, I almost don't want to write a good review so I can keep this place all to myself. First off the menu is adorable and perfect options. Homemade everything and daily specials. Service staff is friendly and upbeat, I hate a caprese Salad and they keep it simple and traditional which I love, dont mess up an already perfect item. Prices for drinks are very reasonable and wine choices are good. I liked it so Much I decided to go the next day for a coffee. I ordered a latte with honey and it was perfect.  Perfect temp and flavor. The gentleman at the window was up beat and happy which is great for a Wed am."}
{"text":"One of our favorite on-the-go places. Conveniently located near the 51 freeway and 32nd street  (you can also get off at Shea), this place has a unique selection combined with common favorites  (like a breakfast croissant or BLT). 
I love the green smoothie and homemade soups and muffins. If you get a chance, try the watermelon gaspacho or white mocha lavender muffin, made fresh daily. But once they're gone, they're gone, so go early! 
There's a cool funky vibe and wonderful staff. Worth stopping for sure!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is definitely a local gem. I loved the variety of quality teas. I had the OMG sandwich - it was prosciutto, marscapone, and figs on a ciabatta panini role - it was totally amazing. The staff were friendly despite the crowd. It is a busy place. My food came out in about 10 minutes from the time I ordered. There is a very small cafe. Larger groups can sit outside on the shaded patio. Plenty of parking in the strip center. Cool music, and high speed wifi. I would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"So, fact-good food (not sure where products come from?) Fact-great atmosphere. Fact-placed in a mediocre shopping center complex that looks like half of the suites are closed. If it were 1/2-3/4 mile east in the new Frys shopping center it would be an outstanding area. 

Overall a MUST try."}
{"text":"Food and Drinks: 5 stars
Service: 2 stars

I would have given this place 5 stars based on the food and drinks and laid back-hipster atmosphere and music, but the service makes me want to give this place a poor rating!

I usually just come here for coffee beverages in the morning/afternoon weekdays and weekends. I love their iced toddy (iced coffee), I get it all the time and drink it black, or an iced quad soy latte. Sometimes a strawberry nutella muffin or Turkey Cranberry sandwich, delicious and I highly recommend them!

However the baristas always appear super busy and never smile or say thank you to customers for their business. I'm also a barista, so i don't understand how hard is it to be friendly to customers, even during a rush... However they are usually busy so its possible they are understaffed. But i'll ask for a packet of butter and be waiting ten minutes and have to ask again!"}
{"text":"I've come here for coffee, lunch to go, happy hour and dinner for a large group. All have been great experiences. I love how this little place has transformed over the years. When the weather is nice you have to sit in their outdoor area. The staff is always attentive and friendly. I don't live in the area but whenever I am nearby I always make a point to go. Bonus points for being dog friendly!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Iced Chai Tea Lattes I've ever had and I've had A LOT! Lol, but honestly every time I go to this place they are very nice and the food and drinks are always amazing. Also very cute atmosphere. Love it!"}
{"text":"After a busy morning and playdate at Imagination Avenue, my friend Jane B and our two almost two year olds had worked up quite an appetite... We wanted a quick lunch before their naptime, so logically, we checked Yelp for nearby lunch spots.  

We didn't have to look far as 32 Shea is literally right across the parking lot... we decided to check it out and we were both very impressed.  32 Shea is a tiny little gem of a restaurant  on the corner of (you guessed it) 32nd Street and Shea.  It's colorful on the outside and inside both literally and figuratively... the staff couldn't have been friendlier - and that's even with 2 toddler boys making a mess as Jane and I tried to order and scarf our food down.

We each had \"the chop\" salad and shared two muffins with the boys.  The salads were fresh and a good portion size, and the muffins were delicious... (we had a carrot muffin and a raspberry muffin).  They actually tasted more like cupcakes, so I don't know how healthy they were, but I'll tell myself they were healthy ;)

The menu has plenty more to choose from as well:  all kinds of coffee drinks, smoothies, breakfast including egg sandwiches, burritos and oatmeal (served until noon), lunch and even dinner!  It sounds like at night the place becomes more loungey with candle light and table service (as opposed to the order at the counter style they have during the day).  I'll have to check that out!

32 Shea reminded both of us of the type of cafe you'd find in a more urban environment like NYC or perhaps even Europe.  The building used to be a drive-thru photo mat and was then transformed to another restaurant before the current owners took it over in 2011.  They've done a fabulous job with it, and it still has a working drive-thru and a nice patio too.

I have one request of the owners: please get some lemonade on the menu!  I wanted an Arnold Palmer but was told you don't have lemonade, so that is something I'd suggest.  Other than that, it looks like you've got something for everyone and I can't wait to return to try more from the menu!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Great coffee. The breakfast sandwich was great but smaller than I thought it would be."}
{"text":"This place is great especially when the weather is nice because I love their patio. They have fun different weeknight specials that they will feature on instagram that have made me want to stop what I'm doing at home and just head over there. The spinach artichoke dip is very good as is all their bruschetta options. A very generous happy hour and then a drive through option for your morning commute to ran your coffee or in my case, iced tea. The servers are awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood spot. It's perfect for breakfast, happy hour or dinner. I think their bruschetta rivals Postinos and it's such a great atmosphere. Love the staff and patio, they even have a drive through for those mornings when you're running late."}
{"text":"This place might be a hidden gem- I was super excited to go and get my morning drink on, this lovely Sunday morning, after driving by it nearly every weekday on my way to work. 

My 'large' tea was more like what a Medium would be over at Coffee Bean. My husband said the same about his Pistachio-Mocha Latte. I thought his latte tasted like... milk. He loved it though because he thinks flavored lattes are usually sickeningly sweet. 

My Tropical Green Tea tasted pretty good (best ever is Cartel Coffee's tea), I just wish I had ordered two of them (basically- I wish the sizes were more generous, as prices are right in line with Coffee Bean.) 

I WILL be back though- this place has such a cool vibe. Overall I am certain it's worth a second trip, I just hope it blows my hair back next time."}
{"text":"Good place to get a coffee or tea.   Assorted. Angels and muffins.   I tried the nuttella strawberry muffin and it was very good.  Enjoy the place.  Very friendly and affordable"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Very similar to Postino! I loved the dog friendly patio and the convenient location. The price was right too for 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks under $30!"}
{"text":"Went here mid morning on Saturday and was pleasantly surprised with the trendy fun ambience.  It's a comfy coffee shop atmosphere. 

There is a very cool little patio with plenty of shade and it is dog friendly.  There is a small seating area inside that is very modern and comfortable.  There is a good size espresso bar where you can watch the baristas do their magic.  

We ordered two breakfast burritos and the Nutella banana sandwich.  The breakfast burritos were extremely good.  The ingredients are very fresh and there is no need to add anything.  Although there was a very yummy green salsa that I choose to add.  The Nutella sandwich was amazing!   Perfect for a small snack!  We also ordered a vanilla latte and a Bloody Mary.   The latte was very good - not overly sweet and very light.  The only downside I experienced at this place was with the Bloody Mary.  It wasn't good at all and I wasn't able to finish.  

All things considered it was a cool place to grab a quick bite and enjoy some socializing.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I found this place while looking for a somewhere to kill time at for an hour and a half before a Drs appointment after work. The place is quite small but nice and cozy in the inside. On the day I visited, it was cold and rainy, so it was the perfect atmosphere. 

I had explored the menu a bit before actually going in so I would be more prepared to order. I ordered a Nutella hot cocoa and the OMG sandwich with the soup, which was chicken tortilla on that particular day. 

I had a few minutes to enjoy my hot cocoa before they brought my lunch to me. When I started on my lunch, it didn't disappoint. The OMG was delicious. There is a ton of flavor and the mixture of the salty prosciutto with the sweet honey, fig and creamy mascarpone was fantastic. 

I'll definitely visit here again when I am on that side of town!"}
{"text":"Shea isn't perfect, but pretty nice little spot. Their food and coffee were good. I came there with my son and we ordered New Mexico burrito and Nutella mocha, both were ok, but honestly, nothing special. The best thing about this place isn't their food, but ambiance and patio area! Even though, 32 Shea may get a little crowded the service is pretty fast, so you don't need to wait in a long line. I think this place is good enough to consider it for our next coffee break!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing! I've been a few times.. However the waiting for your drink inside is a little silly, to wait 15mins in the little walkway is ridiculous.. Also the girl who attempted to bring the food out stated she was busy and couldn't find us, yet didn't even look. Also, our food came before the drinks.."}
{"text":"Beautiful, dog-friendly outdoor patio with fountain. An oasis In the city. We came on a Saturday morning and got he cheddar bacon waffles with rosemary rosemary syrup. This weekend only special was so tasty! They also have $5 bloody Mary's and mimosas- cannot go wrong. When we got the Bloody Mary, they warned us it was extremely spicy and garlic-y and they do not refund what you cannot handle. Did not disappoint and true to that warning! Friendly staff, free wi-wifi. We will return"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for a Saturday morning breakfast spot and stumbled upon 32 Shea. Loved loved loved the atmosphere and will go back just for that. And while I wouldn't rave about my coffee or my egg white bite (my bad), we loved the energy and the fun crew behind the counter, and with other diners as well. We will have to come back to try the happy hour. A solid option for sure!"}
{"text":"Unique and quaint!! I am hooked on the Nutella mocha (iced or hot) and the lobster Mac n cheese was a yummy delight.  Dogs are welcomed and my four-legged munchkin loves getting a treat in the drive-thru!"}
{"text":"Coffee, Tea, Soda Pop, vodka PLEASE!  Yes, it is true; Josh is a rock star behind the bar and is super sweet to-boot. I was in the mood for something muddled and citrusy and his recommendations were spot on.  I really dig the vibe this little gem has to offer. It's intimate with a punch of coolness and although not an unfamiliar concept, they definitely deliver it in their own unique style. Great menu, various drink options, dog friendly, great staff and a drive up window....I like it. I like it a lot. 

Will return- Most def!"}
{"text":"32Shea used to be a drive through coffee business.  The coffee is still yummy and the drive-in  remains open through lunch.  
The kitchen and eating area inside are tiny - maybe 8 tables. The menu includes homemade baked goods, sandwiches, many on fresh ciabatta, salads, and a single entree each night... it's a tiny kitchen. 
I have tasted about half the menu items, including caprese, bruchetta, different daily flatbread pizzas and haven't found one I didn't like.
One unexpected aspect is a bar with an excellant selection of alcohal. My favorite is a a minted lemon drop martini. My friend enjoys a manhattan or Crown Royal.  They serve an honest pour.
Outside is an enclosed patio which is dog friendly. It's a great place to relax, listen to the occasional band, or read a book.
When you go in, it's easiest to order at the register. Then they bring your food to you. The staff is friendly and informed. You do have to get their attention once in a while, but it is worth it.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been in about four times and I don't know why I bother coming back . The food Is okay but pretty slow coming out of the kitchen. The staff has an attitude And are not very responsive to their customers at all. I wouldn't go again and I don't recommend it"}
{"text":"Great location, great innovative menu, great barista/bartender, excellent service  OUTSTANDING patio!! (Downside: the interior is tiny, so the traffic pattern can be chaotic if people are arriving, paying, leaving simultaneously. But - what the heck - enjoy the patio!!)"}
{"text":"Quality coffee and sandwiches...no frills but clean and fast.  Cant go wrong with anything really.  Its nice to have a quality joint like this nearby."}
{"text":"Good food, great vibe, excellent attitude. Had driven by here several times after it converted from a drive-thru coffee kiosk, but never stopped in.  Dined there last night on the reco from our movie-and-dinner partners.  It was a little chilly to eat on the outdoor patio by 8:30, but it's nice to know it's there.  Inside was cozy (maybe seating for 30 or so), and funky/hip without being pretentious.  Menu is compact - a handful of foodie-oriented salads, sandwiches and entrees and a daily special entree and lavosh pizza.   Our flatbread appetizers were nicely done.  My gumbo was absolutely delicious. The fresh basil leaves (from the garden outside) were a thoughtful, unexpected and delicious touch. Wife's roast beef sliders were also good. Great selection of local craft beers available.  Server was uber-friendly and helpful. Owner walked over and chatted with us. We'll definitely put it in the rotation.  I wouldn't drive a long way for it, but its a great neighborhood joint for a 5-10 minute drive."}
{"text":"North Phoenix's perfect little secret. Breakfast drinks are amazing, my personal favorite are the lavender and rosemary-honey. Can't go wrong with any of their fresh baked goods - I always order a muffin (new flavor every time.) The green smoothie is also amazing and chock full of flavor! Don't even get my started on lunch and dinner, everything on their menu is perfect. If you ever find yourself cruising along the 51, be sure to stop by 32 Shea - any time of the day, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"32 Shea is a local business we visit 2-4 times a week. The bartender, Josh, is the best in the valley (in my opinion). His mixology skills are amazing and his attentiveness to his customer exceeds most. The food, cooked by Chef T, is unique and unexpected, but the mix of flavors are better than perfect. The servers are superior for a small joint, and the wait can be longer than most places in the area but well worth the time. The owner, Rebecca, gives extra care to her business and customers. 32 Shea is always on our radar when we are looking for quality local food and bar! The music and neighborhood patrons add an irreplaceable touch! AND we can bring our dog to the patio!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried something new at 32 SHEA. I have been stuck on the roast beef sammie for a while because it is so good. I tried the BLT yesterday and it was awesome as well. Thanks again 32 SHEA!"}
{"text":"This is a hip little spot to bring a date. Good news for them, the shopping center behind them looks great. I could see some cool concepts coming here in the future.

I want to come back to try some of their unique menu items."}
{"text":"I was very excited to discover this new coffee shop last Saturday!  A friend had suggested meeting there, and I mistakenly assumed it would be nested into the strip mall (in typical Phoenix fashion).  Instead, I was surprised to find this stand-alone structure in the parking lot of the NW corner of 32nd St. and Shea.  

You can tell just by pulling up that this place is cool:  contemporary and fun signage, an intimate little patio, and bowls of water set out for dogs to enjoy.  Further indoor signals of this place's cool factor and unique character:  coffee drinks with Nutella (file that under \"why didn't I think of that??\"), a fantastic music playlist that reminded me of the Garden State soundtrack, day-old scones discounted to 50-cents each (love how unpretentious that felt), and boxes of matzoh displayed on top of the espresso machine (when I inquired about what they use the matzoh with, she explained that it was Passover so she thought her Jewish customers might enjoy the matzoh options for sandwiches -- so fun and sweet!).

My iced coffee was fantastic, and I definitely intend to come back and explore their \"Wichcraft,\" AKA, Sandwich, menu.  The description of the OMG sandwich will be enough to get me to come back -- fig, marscapone and prosciutto!

Overall, this independent little shop has potential written all over it, and I can't wait to increase my cool factor by adding it into my portfolio.  Watch out, Luci's Marketplace -- you have some new competition!"}
{"text":"Almost three years after my initial review, I keep coming back and loving 32 Shea more and more. For me it really is as good as it gets. Coming from place where coffee shops are staple of human relationships, sterile Starbucks cafes were easily to bore me to death. I love the vibe 32 Shea has, I love the breakfast burrito and nutella cheesecake, I love meeting my friends there... It is not just another corporate kiss-ass place where everyone give you fake and empty smiles. I see myself coming back here for years to come!"}
{"text":"This is a new favorite place for my husband and I.  We were craving some coffee one day and were feeling nostalgic about the drive through coffee joints in Portland, OR when we drove past 32 Shea.  My hubby ordered an Americano and he loved it.  I had an iced chai that was creamy and delicious.  
A second time, we stopped here for a quick breakfast.  We both had the breakfast burritos that come with little cups of homemade salsa.  The salsa is so flavorful, and really enhances the flavor of the burrito.  It causes a serious case of heartburn later in the day though, so be ready with the tums!!  I would chance a little heartburn for another cup of salsa!"}
{"text":"Much better coffee than the big chains.  This is a great place for a quick lunch or breakfast and the drive through makes caffeine fill ups easy."}
{"text":"Love this cute little spot. Great breakfast burrito. Staff is always friendly and the owner Rebecca is a wonderful hardworking woman. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great skim lattes!  And they have a drive-through!!  One of our absolute favorite places.  Staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for breakfast, we had the breakfast burrito, lox bagel, green smoothie and lavender latte. The food was delicious! The portions seemed small at first but were the perfect size. The lavender latte was amazing! It's a cute spot; nice, green, dog-friendly patio. Be aware it's a little small, but very charming ... We're coming back for dinner another time!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous. They embarrass you if you dare bring your dog inside for one second to order coffee, yell at you, make you feel stupid and tell you to use the hook outside for your dog...guess what, no hook. So, \"dog friendly\" but you can't actually order if you bring your (seemingly unwelcome) dog friend. Rude, out of touch staff. This place could be cool under better management. Suggest pass until they get their S figured out..."}
{"text":"Just love this place.  Ride your bike or bring your pup.  The food is off the hook.  Happy hour rocks"}
{"text":"Fell upon this place because we wanted to go to a restaurant for dinner where we are allowed to bring along our Chiweenie puppy!  Little did I know that this place is AMAZING! From the outside it looks like a little shack and nothing special, once you go inside it is super cute with patio lights and lanterns all around.  Super urban and a perfect casual night to get a glass of wine and food.  Strongly suggest getting the creamy artichoke dip, and the roast beef sliders!   Split both those with a friend and was fully satisfied.  I absolutely love it here and the customer service was superb!"}
{"text":"I love this little oasis.  The service is always friendly and the food and drinks are great.  My favorite right now is the crispy BLT.  SO good!  I've had the iced tea, nutella mochas and blue van beer.  Yummy!  I love what they've done with the patio with the fountain and the buddha.  It's such a cool place to hang out and the indoors is nice as well.   Go check it out!!"}
{"text":"Can you say hidden gem! Great food&wine! Employees are awesome. Our first time there Tuesday are bottle wine and brushetta board for $20"}
{"text":"How can I not update my review to 4 stars when my husband and I are practically regulars? We both enjoy the coffee here. His go to- iced vanilla latte and mine is the iced Nutella Mocha with almond milk. 

Original: 32 Shea was a good place to have breakfast when you want something quick and easy. Our order: early bird sandwich, bacon cheddar waffles and an iced vanilla latte jumbo size. Hubby loved the fact they had 32 oz cups available. 

We sat down and waited patiently for our food. Our entrees come \"simple\" with no sides so the presentation isn't spectacular. The sandwich was ok, slightly slim. I enjoyed the bacon cheddar waffles. 

Overall, quick, easy and we left full."}
{"text":"This place is too darn cute! We came for dinner after an evening hike with the dog. The patio is adorable. They created an impressively cute and unique space in an ordinary strip-mall parking lot! And I love that they are so dog friendly. Almost every table has a pup with them. When I went inside I wasn't expecting the interior to be just as well decorated! Even the restrooms were unique with some super cool lighting. And of course the food was great too! I ordered a mimosa and we got some bruschetta, the chicken raspberry salad, and the roast beef sliders. All delicious! My favorite items were the prosciutto bruschetta and the roast beef sliders, which had some yummy horseradish sauce on them. I want to come back to try breakfast! I already know they have great mimosas!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times for lunch and love the place. I've had everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. 

I went for the first time for happy hour and was slightly disappointed. I was told after 4 pm it's a full service restaurant, but we had to keep going to the bar to get drinks. The bartender would act annoyed and tell us he would bring them to us. That was great if it didn't take 15 minutes to make a drink.

Anyway,  I'm going to stick to lunch from this point forward."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix we actually headed to a very well-known breakfast restaurant in the area, but they were closed for Memorial Day holiday. I quickly pulled up Yelp, saw this place was just a few minutes away and had high ratings and headed over. From my quick scan of the reviews, I somehow got the impression that this place was a full-on restaurant (perhaps based on the two dollar sign price range) that happened to serve breakfast, so I wasn't really expecting much. 

We followed the GPS and found the restaurant in a shopping center across from a Walgreens. The colorful graphics on the outside of the place looked cute and quirky and I noticed they had a drive-thru.  \"What is this place?\" I asked myself -- clearly, it was not a fancy sit-down restaurant... was it actually a fast-food joint?

We walked inside to find a little counter and a number of tables. The woman behind the cash register explained that for breakfast it was self-seating and that we just order at the counter, get our food, and pick out a table ourselves.  We walked through to the patio and found the most adorable outdoor space!  The entire patio has complete tree coverage -- essential for the unforgiving Arizona heat/sun -- and there's the gentle sound of running water thanks to a zen garden + fountain in the back.

The prices were CHEAP!  The very excellent egg, bacon, avocado, and potato burritos were only $5.50 and came with a green chili dipping sauce which was delicious and really hit the spot. We also ordered the Green Shake on their menu, which was under $6. My husband loved the shake so much, he quickly drank his down and went back inside to order another.

Loved the casual vibe of this place. Music was indie rock (Foster the People, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers). Staff was really nice as well. Everyone seemed to be having a great time and you could feel free to take as long as you wanted to eat there.

Would definitely recommend coming here for a cheap and pleasant breakfast/brunch with friends. Perfect spot!  If I'm ever back in Phoenix, would come back to try out their dinner for sure."}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood coffeehouse with flare! We had a dark chocolate mocha and a cold brew toddy...both were amazingly good and tasted like they were handcrafted. I'd give this a 4 stars if the food was a little better. We had the yummy yummy, croissant sandwich, NM burrito and an egg Sammy. All were good, but lack a ton of flavor. The eggs were really thick and pretty bland. Reminded me of sheet tray eggs from a buffet. There was also not a lot of bacon in the sandwiches. We will be back, but most likely just for drinks and a pastry. Cool coffeehouse!"}
{"text":"After seeing this on my yelp searches I finally decided to visit and I've been back a few times since.  It's not that close to the house or it'd be my daily stop before work.  Yup.  The coffee/lattes/chai are that good.  I've eaten breakfast and lunch and the food was good, too.  One of these days I will go for their dinner and try their mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood spot for coffee, drinks and desserts.  We still haven't made it in for an actual meal but we hope to change that soon.  I have tried 4 different coffee/espressos and they were all great.  The 2 desserts they offer were tremendous.  The staff and vibe is very friendly and relaxing.  Very lucky to have this place so close to home."}
{"text":"It's small, it's quaint, the food is...ok, but the patio is super cute. I would come here if not just to kick back and enjoy a nice warm day. I had the breakfast burrito and it definitely required the use of salsa as I found it to be a little dry. It was tasty (with salsa) and of a good size. The menu isn't very extensive but again, I think people come more for the atmosphere than the food."}
{"text":"I love the food here, the beautiful patio and how the vibe totally changes at night time. And I love that it is in my neighborhood. What I don't love is being told it would be easier for them if I paid with a card instead of cash, and being left on hold for 15 minutes last week to order takeout. I'm kind of horrified a business THAT ACCEPTS CASH would ask me to pay with a credit card instead. And I'm equally horrified that calling at 11:10 am would result in a 15 min hold, and then when they finally got back to the phone they hung up on me because I didn't respond within a split second.  Needless to say, I ordered takeout elsewhere last Monday. 

Like I said, the food is great. Love the green smoothie, the chopped salad with chicken, the house dressing, the bruschetta, I could go on and on. But I don't love the attitude =("}
{"text":"Edit: I am adjusting the score of my review. The owner contacted me after the fact and explained in detail what happened and the steps taken to take care of it. The problem was solved and in the end this place has a cool feel and is definitely a spot to have a nice drink in the evening away from the normal bar and club scene.

Original Review: 
Quick review. Ordered an Irish Coffee. Charged $7 and had to ask multiple times about if it was an Irish Coffee or not as there was absolutely nothing but coffee in the cup. Attitude here, could be a better place if the staff would be more attentive and less concerned about themselves."}
{"text":"They cannot have a Lobster Mac this good without a \"Buy 10 Get One Free\" deal. It's completely unfair. Please, I need help. I bought an Entree (large) size and a smaller size \"for my friend\" but honestly I'm going to eat them both myself"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos were so-so, especially for the price. Glad we tried it but wish we had made our own at home instead."}
{"text":"Small, yet busy coffee shop with delicious breakfast options and a great atmosphere all around. Very cool patio vibe."}
{"text":"I really want to give a better rating because I love the vibe and the food is great. Unfortunately the service has been so awful 90% of the time. I always get ignored for a while when i walk in then the feeling i am irritating them by ordering . Also I have waited 30-50 minutes for a sandwich most times I've gone. I really wanted to like this place. Really hope management can get the rude too cool for school employees in check ....also I have never been compensated for waiting almost an hour for food . One guy has been very friendly though ."}
{"text":"REVIEW UPDATE:

Ok, I've been here many, many times since I first wrote my review, and the place just gets better and better.  Dinner is now regularly served, the outdoor patio is open, and the Baristas and Bartenders have clearly hit their stride.  Let us hope that Barista Jeff and Bartender Josh continue to rule the beans and the booze for many years to come.  These fellas are seriously at the top of their game, and extraordinarily personable.

I originally complained a bit about my lattes being a tad too \"wet\" with milk, but those concerns have completely evaporated.   In fact, all coffee drinks (save one) are downright splendid, and I really appreciate the uniformity of quality I get from one day to the next.  The one and only coffee drink that lies south of perfection for me is the frozen/blended mocha-ish one.   I taste some granulation in there.  Its not unpleasant at all, but detracts from the smooth \"blendiness\" that one hopes to experience when buying a drink to stave off the imperial Phoenix summer sunshine.

The place continues to avoid pretentiousness, trendiness, kitsch and gimmicks,  and that \"institutional confidence\" in their atmosphere and product is reflected in both their staff and service.  Now THAT is rare, and worth a trip from wherever you may be in the Valley!

The prosciutto-fig-marscapone sandwich?  Yeah, that's really good.  Where's the button for 6 stars for that?"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 5 stars! Don't judge a book by its cover! When I pulled into the parking lot I was like whaaaat-- because it's the size of a Taco Bell and literally does have a drive through too, haha, but the inside and outdoor patio garden are SO cool!! It's all painted black inside with cool hippie bohemian decor! This place is pretty hipster. The patio has string lights, lanterns, water bowls for dogs, and tons of greenery! Also, I'm a bit of a bathroom snob and this bathroom is really neat. There is a disco ball reflecting colorful lights on the black bathroom walls, and vintage green chair and chandelier in the bathroom!

Food: 3 stars. I ordered the early bird sandwich for brunch and it was okay--basically, a really fluffy plain egg on toast. Would have been better with more of the avocado spread and tomato for increased flavor. 

I also got the Nutella iced latte and it was really chocolatey and cold, not overly sweet either--perfect! 

There's also a good selection of booze, sandwiches, soups, salads, and gluten free options. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I loved 32 Shea in the early days, I loved it during its growing phase and I love the place today! The food is amazing! The Nutella mocha is my go-to drink... No place in the valley makes it better than the baristas at 32S. I can't even find words to describe how delicious the pastries are! Of course the place gets busy... REALLY BUSY. Why?! Because everything about the place is F'ing awesome!! The staff gets a little (sometimes a lot) frantic, sure... Because they're trying to serve you. Sit down and relax (all you 1st time visitors who leave bad reviews). If you don't have time to hang out and enjoy the ambience, maybe go another day when you do. Don't expect fast (Shit) food because this is not that place. The line out the door isn't because the place is mediocre... Au Contraire! I'll say it again, it's Amazing and worth the wait.
Sincerely,
Tried, true and returning customer
p.s. The owner is pretty frigin cool, too!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito I've tasted. So delicious. Cute area to sit outside in the shade."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE 32! I posted a review about 2 years ago and am still fairly regular there with my friends. We go less frequently now because we've all moved further away.

If I could, I would go here everyday (and have in the past for all three meals!).

Everybody is friendly and professional and the food is AWESOME! So is the atmosphere! This is my favorite place in the Valley for food, coffee and just a nice relaxing time."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and enjoyed a peaceful meal on their beautiful patio. I ordered a breakfast burrito and iced coffee. The Tortilla is fluffy, warm, and fresh. The eggs are piping and the bacon was cooked not too hard just how I like. My wife had some of the Fresh Orange Juice which was delicious and fresh squeezed. Great place for breakfast, I'll definitely be back to see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Perfect place to meet up with friends over coffee, cocktails, appetizers or a meal!  Place is a little small l, so as long as you don't mind tight quarters then you're good.  I recommend the bruschetta... they're all scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Unique to this part of town.  A little oasis that is great for Friday evening happy hour.  Friendly customers and wait staff.  Its cozy and funky.  Grab a beer or cocktail and order up a cool starter.  Pretty clever business that I bet is busy all day as a coffeebar, winebar  and solid dinner establishment."}
{"text":"If you are a) in a hurry or b) claustrophobic, just turn around. Turn around now and RUN. 

You will be sitting close enough to hear the wisdom of neighboring randoms in love with the sound of their own voice. (A favorite quote from the next table: \"If you want to be CEO, you gotta get your MBA.\")

You will wait. A long time. A disproportionately long time. Your server is super friendly and kind, but harried and unapologetic, even when shrimp end up in your dinner uninvited. (\"Oh, oops, good thing you're not allergic to shellfish.......... are you?\")

The wine and beer list? Meh. Abbreviated.

The menu? Bruschetta, salads, light sandwiches: your typical wine bar fare.

So why in the eff is the place so successful? Location, location, location. What would be average in Arcadia is novel and exciting in 85028. Really. There is nothing else like it in this part of the valley and for that it wins. Its patio is big, decor is cute, food is decent, and it is god damn chic and exciting if you are used to Applebee's. 

So why does 32 SHEA garner four generous stars? BECAUSE THE NUTELLA MARTINI IS PROOF THAT GOD EXISTS. Pure. Genius."}
{"text":"Upon my arrival to this part of town, I was soon acquainted to this little coffee shop. After my experience at big chain coffee shops, I was surprised at the warmth and friendliness that radiates from every single employee. From Their fresh new menu items (made to order) to their awesome 12 hour happy hour, there is something for everyone even if coffee isn't you cup of tea, they make a tropical green tea that keeps you coming back for more. If there was any higher rating than 5 stars, believe me I'd be clicking them. So I HIGHLY recommend this one of kind coffee shop, a true gem in the North Phoenix Valley."}
{"text":"Unfortunately rude service. I am working right next door and thought it would be convenient to buy my water, lunch and ice tea from here, so I walked in for the second time today(first time I got lunch) and the cashier looked at me and goes, your back again..? As she rolled her eyes. So I apologized, and asked for an ice tea and a water, and I would pay extra for the water. She kept my change, took my order with a snooty attitude and I had to remind her for the water I paid for. Unfortunately, even though the food tastes good, the service won't get my business again."}
{"text":"I waited forever to try this place! Me and a gf went one evening. It was quite busy. I got some kind of Croissant sandwich. There menu wasn't huge. It matched the limited seating in the small restaurant. Usually that means, prepare for something special! I expected more I guess. The food was ok to me. They did have some craft beer available. The staff wasn't very welcoming though. One girl literally just stared at us as we entered the restaurant and waited for us to order. Not the greatest position to be in when it's busy and you have a line behind you (especially when it's you're first time here). One guy seemed very optimistic working though. Anyhow, I wasn't overall amazed. If I find myself in the area...I will try this place again and update this review. Perhaps it's the breakfast, alcohol, or mimosas that they are known for."}
{"text":"I really want to keep coming here but the last couple of experience haven't been great and if they were my only experiences I wouldn't be back.

I stopped by after the lunch rush a  couple of weeks ago and sat at the bar where other guests were seated.  There were 2 individuals behind the bar area, after several minutes....10+.....of their being so engrossed in their own conversation and ignoring me, I left.

Stopped by for happy hour the other night.  Service is normally a bit slow as its a  small prep area, but the yummy cocktails were always worth the wait.   Guess what, the yummy cocktail is gone....instead mixers have been changed and the cocktail that was so yummy now tastes like a melted creamsicle instead of tart and tangy.

The new outdoor area is cute though.

I am giving a 4 vs a 3 due to the past...let's hope they regain their old form."}
{"text":"Just had a latte it's above average in quality
Express is on the lighter side of roasts
Milk is just shot into the cup or poured quickly. Still a lot better then the local chains around This area solid"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere bad service. Seemed good at the start but once a couple other people showed it got worse and worse. Drinks were weak and we didn't even like one of them and the server didn't do a check back to get a different drink. In fact ordered another drink from someone just walking by and left the full drink on the table. Literally melted as we got our tab and left. This was my 2nd time in and will not be giving them another chance."}
{"text":"Disappointed lately - I come here daily, sometime multiple times daily, this morning they were dead and a staff member asked me a question about how to say your welcome in Italian after I said Thank you in Italian - I had an app I played it for her and the general manager literally asked me to not distract the staff - will probably start to take my business elsewhere - Generally great staff, disappointed in management - great coffee, great environment, great food, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Just want to throw in my support of this place. Only been once, wish they were closer to home. Price is a little above my budget, but everything we ate and drank was good, so I'd say it was worth it. Love the patio area design and wish it had been cooler out the day we were there. I think we will go back just for that. The interior atmosphere was nice too, if the tables were a tad crowded together."}
{"text":"Really neat environment, even though it's in the parking lot of a shopping plaza, I love that sitting in the court yard makes you feel like you are somewhere tucked away in a little garden of some sort. 

The food is nice, some items are very unique. The drinks are great, happy hour is awesome and it's dog friendly! 

Service is great, I do wish I have had more of a personal experience and I didn't feel just like another customer but the staff was nice and helped explain the menu if needed. Just prefer not to see drama between the employees or just an inconvenience. 

Note. Go during cooler months so you can sit on the patio."}
{"text":"It seems like there aren't a ton of great restaurants in this section of town (I could be wrong!) but I was pleasantly surprised when our friends took us to breakfast here. It's a super cute coffee shop and café by day and wine bar and restaurant by night. Or I guess by afternoon.

Their breakfast menu isn't huge but good if you're looking for a simple, smaller meal. We all opted for the breakfast burrito. (we each got our own, of course - haha) It was a decent size - not Chipotle-size but big enough for a meal. The tortilla was nice and soft and it was full of eggs, bacon and potatoes. On the side was a green sauce that added a nice little kick without being overwhelming. I thought it was very tasty and everyone else enjoyed theirs as well.

The place isn't very big, they do have a patio but in the summer that might be pretty hot. But it's got a good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. I would love to go back to try one of their lunch or dinner options."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a while. The food is great & so are the coffee beverages. The prices are a bit high, but the drive-thru is convenient - just be prepared to wait for a while for your order. The reason I gave this 2 stars is that they have been fairly consistent at messing up my orders, and the service isn't very good. (I finally decided to stop going there as of the most recent incident.) Also, as an FYI to parents, they don't have high chairs because the dining room is too small.

Update: I spoke with the manager, Rebecca, who was very professional & apologetic. She informed me they have a \"call-ahead\" option for those in a rush: 602.867.7432. 

Second update: I used the call-ahead option, and my food was ready  - & correct - within 15 minutes. I have thus upgraded this review to 3 stars, perhaps more over time should this become a pattern."}
{"text":"Love love love! Great location, perfect for a post-hike quick bite, and so enjoyable during the beautiful winter months in Arizona! I enjoyed a breakfast burrito, which was the perfect size, and my mom really enjoyed her salad (turkey, walnut, fruit, etc.). I also got an Americano which was very tasty. The crew was very busy, but still polite and fun! Couldn't recommend this place more for friends looking for a great stop before or after a hike! They are a wine bar at night, and I'd love to experience that."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee cafe. The patio was great and the wine was decent. Most importantly, the staff was attentive and friendly. What I do like about this place, is that it is setting its own agenda and not trying to be mirror other cafes or wine bars. The owner obviously took a chance on the location and it has paid off. The place is always busy and seems to have a great deal of loyal customers."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! I was recommended to visit and try the caprese sandwich, which I did and fell in love! I sat and waited at the bar and talked to a really nice blonde bartender who seemed to know and run everything. Her service was outstanding and some how managed to check on my food, run the bar and help serve. It was insanely busy so I waited a little while for my food but it was well worth the wait! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"When I moved into my apartment, I couldn't understand why this adorable little restaurant was sitting empty.  My husband and I were very excited to see people working on it and even more excited when we found out it was a coffee shop.  

The staff is beyond friendly.  The assortment of drinks and their creative specials are always tasty.  I haven't tried anything on the sandwich menu, because the breakfast is so good!  My fav is the Early Bird Sandwich - egg, avocado and bacon.  

It's a great addition to a neighborhood I've grown to call home."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in here to grab two coffees before heading to an appointment we had at 10am. We got to 32 Shea at 8:50am and walked inside to order. It wasn't busy and there were two people ahead of us. We watched people come in and out with drinks and so I went inside and asked about our coffee order. The not to happy lady working the front counter said that the ticket didn't come out and needed to take my order again to give to the baristas. I then went back outside thinking she would have them make the drinks right away knowing that we had been waiting. Another 10 minutes go by and I see customers walking in and out with drinks. I went back inside for the third time and they were still not making our drinks and she then proceeded to tell me they were making them now. A few minutes later, still nothing. I went inside and they were continuing to make other customers drinks. It was 9:30 and we needed to leave to make our appointment on time. I told the not to lovely or caring front desk girl that we don't have time to wait for our drinks and they all just turned around and looked at me and didn't say a word. No apologies, no money back offers. Nothing. We went in there knowing we had 40 minutes to order two cappuccinos. I would not recommend this place due to poor customer service and lack of communication and respect for their customers."}
{"text":"It's about time we got a modern cool hang out at Shea and 32nd st.  The coffee is fantastic and it's a fun place to spend a Sunday morning"}
{"text":"I grew up in this neighborhood, but just moved back after several years away. Holy crap is this way better than the 1 hr photo moto that used to be there when I was a kid. They have done an incredible job with the inside. It's limited in space, but well utilized. The patio is great (dog friendly!!!!!). Great prices, awesome/creative drinks, and tasty food."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. We love the bacon egg croissant sandwich and the green smoothie is out of this world good! The service is always great!"}
{"text":"I always get the special-which it is!  Healthy and delicious house salad, too. Fantastic smoothies and coffee. Why are the staff so happy all the time?  Because they eat there!"}
{"text":"The food is disgusting and the owner and staff are soooooo RUDE! 

I order the the lox $8.75 the salmon was translucent, oily, stale and inedible  don't even want to know how old it was.

I also ordered the early bird sandwich $5 which included a microwaved square of pre frozen eggbeaters, 1 small piece of microwaved bacon, a soggy tomato, topped w a scoop of brown avocado squished between two tiny pieces of old bread. 

The staff is extremely unorganized, the kitchen is dirty and the food is awful. Will NEVER return!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute restaurant. The owners have done a marvelous job of creating an atmosphere that makes feel more like you are in a garden than parking lot.

The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. Even though it was our first visit they made us feel like old friends.

The food is good. It is very reminiscent of Postino's before they became a chain.

My only complaint was the Nutella Cheesecake, which is something they are noted for, was very poorly presented. It was a nearly frozen slice of cheesecake plopped on a plate swimming in a watery chocolate sauce that was dumped on top.
Really? Do something. Put some shaved almonds or a dab of whipped cream and drizzle the sauce on top.

They almost got 5 stars. They just need to fine tune the presentation."}
{"text":"great pet friendly patio. fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"First time going today. The atmosphere is excellent and the prices for breakfast are extremely reasonable. Although, the employees had a luke warm attitude with a hint of confusion. I got the New Mexico breakfast burrito, it was tasty and filling but the potatoes were soggy. The homemade green chili sauce definitely saved it. Decent Cold Brew. I'll be back again because it's close by and local."}
{"text":"This place was great! There were quite a few people in there who seemed to be regulars, and I can tell why. The food, green tea and atmosphere were excellent, plus the owner who took my order remembered my name when I was leaving over an hour later, and took the time to make excellent meal recommendations. Customer service like that is rare (unfortunately) and I was impressed. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! First time here and I'm really pleased. It is dog friendly so that's why we came. Very peaceful environment and my puppy is sleeping on the bench next to me! I plan on coming here weekly to help get my puppy out and grab some yummy food."}
{"text":"32 Shea is awesome! The food and drinks are amazing and the atmosphere is great both inside and out on the patio. I love the laid back vibe and the fact that dogs are welcome!"}
{"text":"Awesome environs. Misters, fountain, sweet patio. Great spot to get some laptop work done during the day and groovy food in the eve. Love it."}
{"text":"Oh i hate to do this, (food and drink quality is still good). 32 has been my favorite spot for awhile now for coffee.  Now where do i start on my new review... I struggled between 2 or 3 stars, but i am being biased and letting them live with the 3 instead.

I haven't been to 32 in 2 weeks, and decided to stop by and get some drinks with my wife. When we get there it is all new people working there, that is a little depressing. I will reminisce that the first baristas i met here have been hands down my favorite and none have filled the shoes they left.

Back to my experience.. I have my loyalty card with one punch left. That means my wife and I only need to pay for one of our drinks! Yay! Sounds like my day is going pretty well. The next event was waiting for this girl who was just tinkering on the Ipad to get done and greet us and get our orders. We order or drinks, 

and she says \"I can't give you your free drink.\"

I was just honestly confused and stunned so i didn't say anything.

girl-\"You are doing this in one purchase right?

me-\"yes....\" at this point in my head i am thinking...WHAT!?!? it has NEVER been like that..for the 3 or so years i have been coming here it has NEVER been like that...

girl-\"well you can do it in two transactions\"

me- \"yeah do that.\" ... at this point to prevent me from being over involved in this conversation i flip open my phone and wait for her to figure this all out

The girl turns to the person working on the bar and asks some question about the situation. YAY it's the manager working at the bar, finally a familiar face. She was as confused as i was about the situation.

girl- \"well i don't want to give them a double discount, a punch in the card and a free drink\"


At this point i just space out because this is the most ridiculousness i have heard. NO WHERE does that,  or acts like that...let alone in front of a customer. Granted i did not say anything else and just got my drink and left. 

WOW...i just don't even want to express how sad this is for me that 32 is starting to be one of \"THOSE\" places"}
{"text":"I had actually heard about this place from Yelp a year ago but only recently got around to trying it. It's close to our house, but out of the way when we are driving to work, which is a real bummer because I want to grab lattes and breakfast here all the time now! 

11/21/12: Driving by this place, it could be a little hard to miss the turn, but they have an outside patio and a drive thru that becomes visible once you get closer. After debating if I wanted to eat alone outside, I decided to use the drive thru so I could take it home and eat. I ordered the New Mexico Burrito and a medium iced vanilla latte. The latte was crafted quickly and I drove forward to wait for the burrito. One sip and I immediately knew this latte was AMAZING. I am a coffee snob who can't stand bitter coffee/espresso or exceedingly sweet syrups, but this was neither. The vanilla flavor was strong, but not too sweet. The espresso wasn't over powering and mixed well with the milk and vanilla. Overall, one of the best latte's I've had. Within minutes, my burrito was ready and an employee walked it out to my car. Once home, I cut the burrito in half, slathered some of the homemade green chili sauce that was included on top, and dug in. Mmm, it was good. I even took a pic and emailed the husband, just to make him jealous! Thrilled with my drink and delicious burrito, I promised to take him here next time.

12/2/12: My mother-in-law was in town, so we stopped here for some early morning coffee. I ordered an iced vanilla latte, a blueberry muffin, and she ordered a regular coffee. Again my drink was fantastic and super quick service. My mother-in-law enjoyed her coffee and the sip she had from my drink. The muffin was delicious as well!

Overall, this place is truly a gem! It's small but the décor is nice and welcoming.  The staff is friendly and the service is quick. I'm really looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the food. Service isn't good. They actually seemed careless. Don't plan on coming back here because I don't want to be paranoid about flies getting in my food or beverage. I sat inside but they keep all windows open always."}
{"text":"32 Shea, is the most adorable restaurant.  Not only is the food and drinks amazing but they have the cutest patio to enjoy your meal or drinks on.  They play great music and have wonderful daily specials.  If you have not been to 32 Shea add it to your list, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very cute little place. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but when you go in, it's very nice. The service is attentive, the drinks are great, and the happy hour is 12 hours long (6 am to 6 pm)... Need I say more? OK, I will say more: the bruschetta is $3 a pop, with plenty of delicious options, and they have a nice selection of wine and beer for $4-5, and mixed drinks for $6 during HH. It's not a beer bar per se, so they don't have everything, but they have a respectable selection. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Fun little place!

We went on a weeknight with our pooch and it was surprisingly busy. I love how they renovated and decorated the place. They have a beautiful patio area. It's nice inside but a bit cramped. A loooong time ago it used to be a coffee shack that I used to go to before I went to high school down the street. Definitely a nostalgic area! 

We started out with the bruschetta and some wine. Wine was decent and the bruschetta was awesome. I was a bit disappointed with the portion of the bruschetta though. I'm used to Postinos board of bruschetta with the same price but twice as big. Barely enough for 2 people to share.

We both ordered the entree of the moment which was a shrimp pasta dish, sans shrimp for me. It was delicious. The sauce was so creamy and garlicky. The portion was perfect. However the price isn't listed on the menu and I didn't think to ask. It was a little pricey for a cafe type of environment. 

Service was warm and friendly. They were great with my dog which always wins brownie points for me. The food did take a very long time to come out though. The bruschetta took about 40 minutes, entree about an hour. Long time for a weeknight. 

Overall we had a great time. I can't wait to come back and have a leisurely brunch with my hubby and pooch. The breakfast items look amazing (reasonably priced too!) and they have mimosas!"}
{"text":"Amazing food Outstanding service! Great atmosphere! Great patio! Free Wi-Fi ! Pet friendly! Breakfast sandwiches are Amazing! Coffee NOT so good!!"}
{"text":"I got a large Americano to go from this place. Price is about right, coffee was good. Better than Bucks, but to me, everything there is burnt. 

I didn't order food, but many things looked good and the pastries looked great. The service was good, a bit slow. But you know, they used espresso machines where you didn't just push buttons and stuff came out. So, that happens. 

My only complaint was that inside the cafe it was hot. I'm sure the air hadn't kicked in yet. 

I'll head back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. Walking in you see what you'd expect from any city coffee shop, busy baristas but don't let it fool you they were very kind and helpful and always had a smile on their face. That emotion is then expressed in their coffee. I had their nutella mocha. Personally I don't care for nutella but I had heard great things about it and it did have a distinct taste without obstructing from the coffee so it was a great wake-up for my hike at Piestewa that followed. Their food is great and their back patio area is wonderful. A great tranquil spot to meet at all day with the perfect amount of shade in this Arizona heat. Loved it."}
{"text":"This is a nice small place to grab some breakfast on the patio.  Their coffee is great and I usually get their breakfast burrito.  The breakfast burrito is on the small side but definitely plenty enough to get you going.  It's served with a fresh cilantro sauce.  The patio is very dog friendly which I love if your pup is a friendly one.  Leave the grumpy ones at home!  Nothing worse then trying to enjoy your meal and a dog fight breaks out right next to you."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed this morning. Ordered my usual Dirty Chai (they make the best) and was handed my drink by someone with less than clean hands. Dirty nails and stained hands, probably by coffee... I get it. I can get passed that... But then the lid and coffee sleeve looked like they had literally been plucked from the garbage.  The lid had splashes of dried coffee and some mysterious black smudges. The sleeve had coffee stains all over it. Totally turned my stomach and ruined my latte craving. I understand that they're working with the morning rush, and making hundreds of drinks in the morning... And that might be their only sloppy cup served that day. I was really looking forward to a yummy comforting chai, and now  afraid to drink it."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Bring your pups and hang out in the great outdoor patio.  The vanilla iced latte is amazing and I love the breakfast sandwich.  Ingredients are fresh, quality is great.  The staff is friendly and the music is relaxing.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great little gem hidden near a parking spot. I sat outside in the patio and the awesome weather helped immensely.
The servers were friendly and quick. The coffee was good and so were some the cocktails I tried- Moscow Mule !!

There were other things on the menu which I will be back to savor.."}
{"text":"The menu is a bit narrow, but the quality is pretty good. I would classify this place as a bit of a \"hipster\" joint, but it doesn't fall squarely into that category. The service was good, the food was good, and the atmosphere was relaxed. I will be going back. The Nutella cheesecake was awesome and the patio is dog friendly."}
{"text":"I was so surprised when we pulled up this adorable little place.  From all the pictures I thought this would be a HUGE place, but remarkably, it's small, quaint and unassuming.  The people that greeted us when we walked in were very kind; when we told them we had never been here before they took the time to tell us about the place and about the food.  We made our decisions and sat in the zen garden under a full shade umbrella.  They brought our food and beverage and we had a foodgasm!  The Watermelon gazpacho was A.MA.ZING!  I indulged in the OMG sandwich which was to DIE FOR good and my friend indulged in the Capreze (sp wrong I'm sure) and she didn't talk much while she ate.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this little place and even though I live in Gilbert, AZ I will make the trek back.  Thanks so much for a wonderful lunch!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stop in here about once a week and the staff are always friendly.  Great local place to get a good cup of coffee, tea or baked goods. Quality and quick service.  Nice patio area for when the weather is nice and a drive-thru for on the go service."}
{"text":"I came here with my dog one afternoon I had off of work to try out one of their facebook specials- a turkey and cranberry sammy with cream cheese, tomato, and lettuce. The sandwich was seriously phenomenal and the employees were very sweet and happy. I can't wait until they start staying open later and add music to the patio so I can sit out there one of these cool nights with a glass of pinot and maybe the OMG sandwich. Definitely loving this neighborhood restaurant, even while they continually grow."}
{"text":"Unique - Tiny - Charming. 

 Literally a tiny box building plopped in the middle of a parking lot. Not connected, just there... like it used to be a water jug fill-up place, or could have been a tiny drive through of some sort. Hmmm.. I was honestly surprised how petite this place is. Not a hang out and do work sort of place. I could see enjoying it more as an after work, grab a glass of wine - sit at the bar and chat with the baristas and other locals. Sitting area was super cramped - and careful as you walk out - you are walking in front of the exit of their drive through. Mind the traffic! Don't get smushed. 

Very nice staff :) 

My sweet tooth of a man had a Nutella Mocha - and he devoured it happily."}
{"text":"Love this place! The sandwiches are amazing and the bruschetta at dinner time is so yummy. The Nutella Mocha is my favorite drink and the staff is always super friendly. Their outdoor patio is so comfortable and I love that they're dog-friendly!"}
{"text":"I went in today and the service was really good. I'm glad they've made improvements.

I've said before, I really want to love this place. The ambiance is just great. The coffee is REALLY GOOD. The food is good. The outdoor patio is AMAZING. You dont feel like your sitting in a parking lot. But every time I'd come in, the service was either extremely ride or just shitty. But I tried it again and I'm glad I did. There was a staff of 3 working and they were all great. Fast friendly and personable"}
{"text":"Owner Rebecca is rude and saves 4-top tables for some reason even if a couple shows up and explains that they will order a bottle of wine and appetizers while waiting for another couple to show and multiple tables are open.  I get you want a full table but if we're ordering $45 worth of food/be upon arrival isn't it worth not upsetting us to save a 4-top?  We won't be back, which is frustrating considering we only live 3 blocks away."}
{"text":"My friend and I live just seconds away and go by all the time. Finally on a nice early Monday morning after a visit to the doctor we said- \"Hey lets try the 32st Street place for breakfast\" 
Very good. We both had the New Mexico breakfast burrito . I had the cold drip coffee and my friend had regular coffee. Wow I had never had the cold drip - a new favorite of mine now. As for the burrito- we both took half home for the next day. 
Next we are going to do lunch for the roast beef sandwich or the special and a martini. Can't wait. 
A real gem in our backyard."}
{"text":"I have been for breakfast and dinner and it has been such a great experience every time."}
{"text":"We found this little gem after an early morning Sunday Peak hike. It's a small little place with a dog friendly nice size patio. It looks and feels like it came straight from Venice beach. The burrito was very yummy . . . Special ordered with no cheese and crispy bacon.  The rosemary mixology was yummy and I'm now an official Chai coffee fan. Seriously the best chai I've ever had the pleasure of sipping.  The service is top notch and I don't say that lightly. . . Attentive, up beat, and they are moving with urgency yet creating a calm vibe.  And if that wasn't enough . . . The prices are really good.  Cocktail, Chai coffee, and breakfast burrito for under $24 with tip. The cocktail was the most expensive thing on the menu. I will be a regular here.  

P..S. Rocking Drive threw that is packed yet moves professionally. There is a reason this place is thriving!"}
{"text":"32 Shea is a cute little building. Its patio is covered with trees and it feels like you're somewhere secluded in the middle of a forest. I really loved this spot and how they use local ingredients and make great food. 

The bacon cheddar waffles are only available on the weekends. Usually I don't order waffles because I don't like them too sweet. This was perfect for me because it was a savory waffle with rosemary infused syrup. The waffle had big hearty bits of bacon that would gave a satisfying crunch. 32 Shea was a really fun place- I suggest going for breakfast after a good hike on the weekend."}
{"text":"Great patio, killer Nutella mochas, service is hit or miss. All in all, a great little neighborhood joint that has been around forever."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times the service was great. Quick and no bullshit! My favorite drink is the nutella mocha, iced!"}
{"text":"Locally owned, so that is immediately a plus for me. They have the cutest atmosphere and great coffee.  I love coming here for their late night drinks as well. It is small, so sometimes the service is slow. But that is expected for a small place. This is definitely a great spot ro just rewind and I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I worry about the competency of the staff here. Irish coffee with Jack Daniels and no fresh cream on top?? Quite an expensive drink to not be made correctly. 

Also, the only \"hot sauce\" they provide is Tabasco."}
{"text":"Very cool little cafe for food and coffee bar. Located right in a parking lot type of area but a seriously cool hidden gem. Definitely a trendy vibe with young and fun atmosphere. 

The patio area is decorated nice with a relaxed atmosphere. They have heaters, a small water feature, nice greenery and plants, and a cool statue head. 

Inside seating is small but fun mom-and-pop vibe of a good coffee bar. 

Drive thru is also available. 

Order at the bar then take a seat. After 4pm it's apparently more of a restaurant style where they serve you. 

Definitely a cool spot to check out."}
{"text":"Updated 7.02:
5 stars!! Love this place for breakfast or dinner. Lovely and lively staff and the best decaf. Try their Nutella mocha (iced) with almond milk and their house-made orange syrup! So good!!!! Their bruschetta, sliders and drink options are great as well ;)"}
{"text":"We love this place, the food is so good.  It's a small and very charming place that is very popular with the regulars; everyone is friendly and the staff puts up with all manner of BS from rude people, dumb dog-people, kids, etc. all with a sincere smile on their face...  very professional and kind.  The owner is a smart and very classy lady.  She has brought a cool edge to our little neighborhood, we are so lucky to have this gem!"}
{"text":"Friends who live nearby took me to breakfast here on Sunday, I now daydream about the pumpkin spice latte on my drive to work everyday and wish I lived closer. Great food and drinks and good service.  If another locations ever opens Gainey Center could use it. :)"}
{"text":"We were driving down the 51 and needed a caffeine fix, sure enough 32 Shea was 2 minutes out of our way! I hopped on Yelp and started stalking the photos to see what the regulars order. 
Again, we stopped to grab coffee and $20 later we are eating a breakfast burrito, pineapple coconut muffin and I'm chugging down my Nutella mocha.

The service is quick and they sure do hustle, I don't feel rushed ordering either which is nice because at some coffee joints they are so anxious to move onto the next guest. 

The breakfast burrito is not anything to write home about, it does seem microwaved and the guacamole store bought, just my opinion and didn't stop me from eating it! 
The muffin was delicious and coconut packed! 
If I ever return to the area and happen to stumble upon 32 Shea again, I would re-order the Mocha which isn't too sweet of your worries about sugar. 
Thanks 32Shea for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I saw this spot strolling through town this morning and thought I'd give it a shot!   Wow what a pleasant surprise!  The guys were super friendly and offered me almond or soy milk as a dairy substitute!  It was clean and nice.  The coffee was brewed well; the beans were full flavored; not burnt.  I love this place.  My new favorite coffee spot!"}
{"text":"Loved this place for a quick lunch. The staff were very friendly and helpful when I asked for recommendations. The sandwich was so tasty and tasted fresh. The outdoor patio was also very pleasant and had a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love my neighborhood cafe!! I walk from my house for seriously yummy desserts. The Nutella cheesecake and the Afogatto are the bomb!!! Our server Rachel is always very nice. It's great to be able to go to a locally owned restaurant for a change. Yeah 32 Shea!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice
Wine and beers. Had the sandwhich it was ok. Patio
Is
Cool but a weird spot in the middle is 32nd and shea. Wanted breakfast but it's only
TILL noon. :("}
{"text":"If only I could keep 32 Shea g-14 classified forever! It's that rare gem you don't want to share because you would rather keep it a secret. The coffee is on point every time, my favorite is the rosemary honey latte. The staff is uber friendly, so friendly you wish you can give them a hug for their awesomeness. Breakfast (try the lox) lunch (must have roast beef) , or happy hour (try lemon drop) you will not be disappointed. Dog friendly too which is an A+! Last but not least the patio is remarkable. It's the perfect ambiance to enjoy reading a book or catching up with a friend. 32 you are worth the drive from Scottsdale every time! Other coffee shops need to drink your \"kool-aid\" because you are awesome sauce!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my husband and father in law as soon as we left the airport. This place has delicious sandwiches and friendly service.

I ordered the OMG with the soup of the day, broccoli cheddar. I took a seat outside on the beautiful SHADED patio section. The sandwich with soup was $10 and one of the best cold sandwiches I've ever had. This sandwich has fig, mascarpone, and prosciutto .. what more could you ask for. 

Small ish downside, I'm not from around here and it is HOT. Most of the seating looks like it's outside. Probably fine for a cooler day, but less comfy on a 100+ degree day."}
{"text":"The New Mexico bfast burrito w/o cheese, add basil - not bad for $5, although it's a bit on the small side.  The homemade green salsa is very good.  I'd love an option for more veggies.

The espresso leaves a LOT to be desired, however.  It's an unusually light espresso roast, nothing memorable, a tad bitter.

Very helpful and friendly servers/barista.  

They were running a music class for toddlers on their patio on a Wed morning.  Cool."}
{"text":"Been here several times it's got a nice patio but they made a HORRIBLE dirty martini. Pure olive juice. Couldn't drink it. I asked if they could fix it...solution after 15 minutes is, \"we'll have to charge you\" wow after an $11 charge the least they can do is make it drinkable. But no. They lost a customer forever here. And all the bad word of mouth. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Arizona by far beat lattes and mocha of all kind everything was simply perfext , great staff and they have alcohol and drive thru!!! Wow be back weekly for sure"}
{"text":"My husband and I did not have a good experience here. I saw on the menu online that they have bruschetta, and so I was craving it for about a week. When we walked in, the place was small and very dark.  We seated ourselves, ordered waters, and looked over the menu. The waitress had a bit of a 'tude, and kept asking what drinks we wanted to order. Um, sometimes people just don't want to order a drink. Sue me. So we ordered a plate of bruschetta and the chicken salad to split. The bruschetta was so-so; not quite what I wanted. We got the salami and pesto, goat cheese and cranberry relish and feta, olive and tomato. They were a bit sparse with the toppings. The salad was actually very good, but I wish they used chunk chicken instead of sliced deli meat. Overall I will not be back. I will stick with Postino's."}
{"text":"This little place is perfect for enjoying a morning beverage or an evening drink. The patio is fantatsic, truly a little oasis is a very unexpected location."}
{"text":"32 Shea is so damn cute. We've been here twice for breakfast and it's been delicious.

My husband and I have ordered the same items both trips: The New Mexico burrito for him, the Early Bird sandwich (sans mayo) for me. The homemade green salsa they serve with the burrito is to dieeeeeeeeee. The sandwich is so tasty--I love the combo of turkey and avo on it. The toast can be a little dry without the mayo, but I'm willing to make that sacrifice. Mayo, blech. We always enjoy their very delicious iced coffee. We've also split pasties and muffins and they are choice.

The inside is a little cramped and ordering can be hectic, but once you find a space on their idyllic patio (seriously, so zen and dreamy), it's a breeze. We had our pup in tow on our most recent trip, and the patio is so dog friendly. Lots of head pats and other friendly doggos.

We aren't in this area a ton, but when we are, we love to stop by!"}
{"text":"I love this place for its unique atmosphere in a pretty run - down strip mall. I love the variety of coffee drinks, alcoholic beverages, and awesome bruschetta. Staff has gotten friendlier. The lavender Chai is my favorite coffee/tea drink in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"My neighborhood actually has a top tier cafe! I'm very excited about this place. It has everything: Great decor, unique menu, hi-quality food and beverage, too-cool-for-school hipster staff. I really have enjoyed everything I have consumed there. Every Saturday morning I get an iced chai latte, large, DIRTY! (double espresso shot). It gets my day going. They don't get 5 stars, solely because the hipster attitude comes across rude sometimes. Not a major deal, but 5 stars equals perfection to me. Keep up the great work! FYI: 32 Shea has a liquor license, so their drink menu is just as awesome."}
{"text":"What a wonderful oasis in the area. I love to stop in and have wine and tasty appetizers after work. This is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Met a friend for beers at 32 Shea recently and was really charmed and impressed with the place. It's clearly more of a coffee shop, but really just an all-around nice little neighborhood gathering spot. I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I just have to write a review for this place because I love it here! The sandwiches are so delicious and I love the bread that comes on them. They taste so flavorful and healthy. The location is a little sketchy but the food is so worth it. The coffee is VERY good too. I love the outdoor seating with the trees shading off the entire patio and the fountain which adds a nice feel to it. Not to mention it's a drive through!"}
{"text":"I've visited this place twice, both after work. I've enjoyed bruschetta and happy hour cocktails at the bar as well as on the patio. I've also sampled their pizza of the day. Everything I've tried has been phenomenal. Our service has always been excellent, very attentive and good at making recommendations. The vibe of the place is great and the patio is quite happening.

My only critique is that it is so tiny, but I guess that adds to the cozy feel. And to be fair, I've never had to wait for a table.

I want to try everything on the menu. I can't say that about a lot of places. If I had the money, I'd definitely be a regular at this place.

P.S. They make a mocha with Nutella in it. I haven't tried it yet, but I find myself pondering its glory often."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast burrito and lavender latte! Very cute seating area. Definitely recommend to check out!"}
{"text":"I love the outdoor patio and the great service :-)

Great coffee and such a good energy."}
{"text":"Checked it out because of the dog friendly patio.  We had the New Mexico burrito which was ok, nothing to rave about but nothing bad.  I didn't like the Bloody Mary at all it had a greenish tint and tasted like cilantro."}
{"text":"My sisters and I decided to do lunch here this past Sunday. It was freezing (for Az) outside and the windows were wide open. We sat at a table that still had not been cleaned yet, by the open window. 1. No one ever came over to clean up and we had to bus it ourselves 2. we got yelled at for closing the window. We closed the window b/c the wind was blowing in. The guy actually yelled across the room to yell at us...\"ummm... could you not touch our window's?\" Really??!!! Shut-up geek.  3. $1 extra for a piece of lettuce and paper thin cucumber 4. I could have had a better sandwich and experience...well anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Incredible food, drinks and prices. So welcoming and comfortable. Everyone here is so friendly.  Great neighborhood joint, but worth the drive if you don't live nearby."}
{"text":"32 Shea is a very delightful place to get something to eat and is also a great choice if you are looking to have an alcoholic beverage. The outside seating is ample if you feel that it's a bit stuffy to be indoors. They keep it dark inside, mood lighting for sure.

I ordered the charcuterie board ($15), nutella cheesecake ($7) and their special expresso, ice cream, liqueur drink ($8). It did take more than 20 minutes, but I did ask for everything to show up at once, so fair is fair. The specialty drink, wasn't even all the way full? Either use a smaller glass or fill it all the way up. 

It's kinda funny, but I spent 32$ at 32 Shea (with tax) lol but seriously, it's not the cheapest place, but the quality of their food is really superb. I recommend their charcuterie board as it had a good Mediterranean vibe too it (a touch salty). The nutella cheesecake was mediocre at best and their Specialty drink was decent.

Solid service, decent food, great ambience: this is an overall 4 stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"Another great happy hour place.
Good wine, good beer, and good happy hour foods. Love the bruscetta  (sp??). There are several kinds to choose from. I have to go back on a Tues for that special of 3 burscettas and a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Food was great but the owner was very rude to her staff and that was off putting from the start.  They forgot my daughters bagel so I had to wait in line, order was screwd up again so I had to wait in line again to have it fixed.  I then waited in line for five minutes just for a refill of water so I don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the atmosphere! Drinks are great, patio is lovely, and employees are wonderful. It can get a bit loud at times but this is generally my favorite place to study in the morning! Only downfall for me is the lack of vegetarian/vegan options. I'd love to see one vegan option on the menu without having to drastically modify my order."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on my visit there yesterday morning for ice coffee. Worst ice coffee ever. The coffee was WAY to old or something because it was to bitter to drink.  3.00 plus a 1.00 tip wasted."}
{"text":"Came across this cute little coffee shop early Saturday morning.  I was so impressed when I walked in.  Very warm and inviting inside with a hip, urban design.  I only bought a banana and americano (which was fab!) but I can't wait to go back and try their food items.  They serve also serve Nutella infused Hot Chocolate. Wow! Definitely going to try that next time."}
{"text":"Brought my daughter in this morning she had a blueberry muffin and I had a breakfast burrito, okay, how can I say this...AWESOME. Coffee is fantastic and fresh, the muffin was great, and I think my new vice may be their breakfast burritos!!! Been here many times and this place is just fantastic."}
{"text":"Tonight's special was amazing! Chef \"T\" is awesome! Her ability to make original plates that are extremely well thought out and very satisfying to the palette is brilliant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food is great and so are the drinks. I ordered the bruscetta and the moscow mule, they were great! This is a great place to sit on the patio. I wish I had known about this place sooner."}
{"text":"What an amazing little place! I got the turkey and cranberry sandwich with a coffee today from there and it was to die for! I will definitely be going back for more! We need more little local cafes like this one."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to have a few drinks and food and fun go elsewhere. They have a\"strict 3 drink maximum policy\". We were not rowdy, loud or \"endangering the safety of the staff\" in any way. Our server was excellent in every way. She told us that, unfortunately we would not be allowed to have any more to drink. I heard the general manager tell the staff we would not be allowed any more to drink. The general manager came out to talk to us. She  lied to us and said \" I can't believe your server treated you that way\". It was not the server's decision to enforce the policy. Again, I heard the GM tell the staff we were done. Yet she lamely attempted to blame the server. The service was great. I understand the reason for the policy. However, again, we were not loud or rowdy or dangerous or even inebriated. So, if you plan on having fun go to OHSO's or the Dubliner. Stay away from 32Shea."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I do love this place and we come here often. However I must bring up the fly problem happening in the inside dining area. Horrible. My husband killed no less than 25 sitting at our table with a menu while at dinner tonight. What does the kitchen look like? We did tell the server, he said good job you get a medal the next time you come in. We handed our menu back saying put it in the dishwasher for sanitation. You need to address this issue."}
{"text":"Delicious food, delicious drinks, wonderful customer service, and reasonable prices. I've been through Phoenix twice and I must confess that 32 Shea is one of my two favorite restaurants in the greater Phoenix area.

There was a chance that I would have to move to Phoenix for work in the next year or so, but I've been accepted elsewhere. 32 Shea was one of those places that made me slightly regret my decision. For anyone visiting Phoenix, it's a must-eat place. For anyone who lives in the Phoenix area, shame on you for not trying it sooner.

It's not a rowdy place. It was relatively quiet and relaxing when we were there. There was a cute and charming ambiance. I'll probably be driving through Phoenix again in May and I will definitely stop by this place at least once."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood joint. They even have a drive-thru! The Nutella mocha is a must try. I also like the Caprese, Veggie-tarian, and Turkey Cranberry sandwiches."}
{"text":"Rude/slow service, bland food and when I was served the wrong coffee I was publicly humiliated by the bartender/drink maker behind the bar. How it was my fault I took a sip of a drink that was served to me is beyond my comprehension. I will never go back. I can find better places to spend my money, thank you."}
{"text":"Two words: Lavender Latte

Holy, thank you Lord for this delicious concoction and for this homely place called 32 Shea.

Looks like a bar ... but let me tell you it feels like home- without a doubt. 

I had a lovely cashier who was just a sweetheart and was sporting a leather hat that I was mirin', he was quick to take my order yet made it feel unrushed and was sure to answer my questions. I got the Lavender Latte and Steel Cut Oats with fruit. My order came out in a timely manner and was absolutely perfect. The Lavender Latte was out of this world and had beautiful smooth latte art. My biggest thing with Lavender and Rose (floral) flavors in food or coffee is the balance, too much and it's like you're eating soap though when it lacks it's underwhelming. 32 got it spot on in the middle, it was amazing. The oats were good, typical steel cut and more on the wet side. It came with slices of banana, berry, cinnamon and brown sugar. It also didn't cost an arm and a leg, so you can bet the portion is about a cup or so. Prices aren't too bad either!

32 Shea has a spacious open patio, that is secluded enough to make you forget you're sitting in a random plaza parking lot. Serves up great coffee and provides killer food, also they have a twelve hour happy hour. Did I grab a craft beer at 9 in the morning? No, but now I know that I can without some kind of judgement being passed here. Limited space indoors, but airy and open enough to get fresh air and light with a view of the bar as well. Really great vibe here, everyone seems to be in the best mood and looks like there are tons of frequents ... which isn't surprising.

Can't wait to try out their Rosemary syrup, Nutella Mocha, Green Smoothie and Toddy next!"}
{"text":"I love this local coffee/winebar! I was introduced to it a few years ago and have frequented it since. It has an urban quaint atmosphere inside and a serene, relaxing, and zen outdoor patio. Dog friendly too! If you find yourself driving by and wondering what this place is, it is definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"The best lobster mac ever!  Every time we come we have it and will again and again!!!  We always sit at the bar and the staff are the best.  Great for date night!!"}
{"text":"Pricing is good, service is good, the coffee I got was good, and the atmosphere was great. Has a nice smaller relaxed coffee shop vibe to it with some real character. They have comfortable indoor and outdoor seating with some misters and a well decorated patio outside. They also have a drive through and are pet friendly! It is a great spot for a first date (my reason for going there)."}
{"text":"I am writing this for my son and husband.  They don't have Yelp accounts so I am yelping for them.  

My husband had a sandwich that he said was delicious.  He even noticed how cool the place is!  This is saying something, from a guy who rarely notices his surroundings when chowing down.

My son walks to 32 a few times per week.  He's really into good coffee and claims this is the best!  Loves the outdoor seating and the fact dogs are allowed.  Yay!

There you have it, a review from a couple of my loved ones.  You can bet I'll be going there soon."}
{"text":"It's just ok here. They charge for iced tea refills (we were dining in). I can afford to pay for a refill but it left a bad taste in my mouth, won't be back. Seems like they nickel and dime you."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It fulfills my study/coffee shop needs during the day and transforms into a lovely wine bar with a dinner menu at night. I would recommend the toddy with Nutella and the raspberry salad with chicken. Great atmosphere with a beautiful, dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"I found this local spot a couple of months ago and I have now found myself to be a regular.
Their service is unparalleled! Everyone that works there is genuinely happy and welcoming.
Everything I have tried had been excellent and I enjoy the unique spin they add to their menu!
One thing that bums me out is they have a limited amount of bacon cheddar waffles on the weekends so if you want them get up early!!!"}
{"text":"This place was cozy and cute. We sat outside at a table for two, and it was perfect. I loved the atmosphere and the ambiance. the only issue I had was that when loud cars and motorcycle drove by, it completely drowned out the conversation. (That's why I have given the place 4 instead of 5 stars.)

I ordered the Nutella Espresso Martini because I love Nutella, espresso, and Irish Creme, and as promised, it was worth the wait. I also got a chop salad, which wasn't really anything to write home about, but the martini was definitely worth going for. Definitely go for the drinks, if nothing else!"}
{"text":"I had the caprese and a coffee for lunch. It was quite good. My partner had a pastry and an Italian soda. We visited during the summer, so we had to sit inside. ThE inside is a bit cramped, but usable space. I didn't like that I could hear our neighbors conversations. The patio looked inviting and chill though.  I love that this is a cafe that serves alcohol. It is also very close to our home. We'll definitely have to come back to try out more things and hang out on their wonderful patio space!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, friendly people. Not the most comfortable patio area but it's nice."}
{"text":"A great local neighborhood spot with a nice atmosphere. Coffee, food, beer, and wine; they got you any time of day. Eat on the patio if the weather is nice; it is enclosed and has a misting system. Inside is small with a coffee bar and tables for 2 and 4 people.Delicious menu with a daily special that is always outstanding. Whoever chooses the music has great taste."}
{"text":"Love this little gem of a place. The often changing menu specials are creative and always delicious. Great service and a cozy patio."}
{"text":"If you're looking to linger over a glass of wine with a friend, or are meeting up with a special someone for a date, this is an excellent spot. 

If you're lucky, you'll catch a live band playing some mellow tunes on their spacious and unique patio. 

Check it out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a mimosa, breakfast burrito, and coffee. Delicious!
You order at the counter, get your drinks, and grab a seat either inside or outside on the patio. Really cool vibes on a Sunday morning for brunch. 
Soft music, friendly staff, and cool diners. FYI - Dogs welcome on the patio.
Can't wait to come back for happy hour and dinner. I hear the bruschetta is to die for."}
{"text":"I have frequented 32 Shea for years now, going back for the food and the laid back vibe. Unfortunately, I have had horrendous customer service experiences the past few times I've gone. Being that I serve tables in the area, I have quite a bit of patience when it comes to these things, but my experience today was absolutely unacceptable. Called the restaurant to put an order in ahead of time before work this morning. The girl on the phone seemed to be confused when I ordered the bagel and lox, thinking I wanted the lox as well as another bagel- fair enough. A misunderstanding is one thing, but the tone she gave me was appalling. Although being a little turned off at how I was spoken to, I headed over to 32 Shea to eat my quick breakfast. Upon arrival, I go up to pay for my order and the male cashier very rudely explains to me that they are out of the lox. Okay, then why didn't the woman who took my order know that? And why is it that I am being presented with an attitude when you guys messed up? Was given no apology, just the option to order something else instead- which I didn't have time to wait for. Waste of my morning, would have just eaten something quick at home had I known. Take phone numbers next time if employees and kitchen don't know how to communicate food count."}
{"text":"I absolutely love 32 Shea. I work and live in the area and have fallen in love. My coworkers and I come here at least once a week for lunch. It's simple, quaint, good service, nice atmosphere, and the price point isn't bad at all. We sit on the patio and enjoy the sunshine while we eat our O.M.G. sandwiches - to DIE FOR! Jeff is the guy behind the register most days when we go - he's awesome!

You might be surprised to learn where 32 Shea is located. It's in the parking lot of a strip mall that appears run down and deserted at the corner of 32nd Street and Shea Blvd. Prior to the 51 highway, this little section of town got quite a bit of traffic. However, since building the 51 not much traffic gets down to that corner - causing many of the businesses in the area to struggle the past 8 or so years. I'm hopeful that with the success of 32 Shea other businesses will follow suit: great service, good food and good atmosphere creates a successful business. 

Can't wait to see what's in store for 32 Shea. They're doing their own marketing, creating their own vibe and successful in their efforts so far!"}
{"text":"The only reason for the three stars is because of the personnel. I went there last night for HH with a friend and really liked the atmosphere (5 stars!), the patio was so cozy and quaint. The wine was good and the HH food was also pretty good. I like to have choices that are healthier (caprese salad vs fried everything!). 

So, for the personnel - I witnessed some pretty unprofessional behavior between, what appeared to be a manager, and a young man who was seating people and bussing tables. He was showing some ladies to a table on the patio when I noticed this manager (short dark hair) grab the menus from his hand and pull him aside and start scolding him about something - loud enough for others to hear and while leaving the ladies standing there waiting, then she leads the ladies to their table, which was right next to ours. A few minutes later this same woman came up to the ladies at the table and said something unkind about the young man. It was so unprofessional and I'm not sure how a business can have repeat business with shenanigans like this. I won't be back solely based on what I witnessed. If you're going to be in the people business, hire \"people\"people!"}
{"text":"I am so in love with this adorable little hole in the wall. First off, the atmosphere is perfect. I can sip on my delicious iced almond milk dirty chai outside in the tranquil little garden they have which is shaded by trees and umbrellas while I read a book or catch up with some friends. I wish I remembered the name of the guy at the front taking orders and making drinks, he's funny and makes pretty damn good drinks. By the way the food is delicious. I got the vegetarian sandwhich so I can't say much for the other stuff but mine was pretty great. And if I want to come back later in the evening with my friends and have a couple drinks and some dinner it's a great spot for that as well. 

So overall, great service and good people!"}
{"text":"What a great place. Nothing else to say, you've got to check it yourself to understand. Trust me, you should!!"}
{"text":"The owner is very personable, a woman, and the service is great.  Hope to visit more often!  Friends referred me here who live in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Great Basil Gimlet!  Nice intimate atmosphere and great patio!  A number of good food choices and just a great local hangout.  Get away from the standard stuff and give local a try."}
{"text":"I wish they weren't so selfish on the flavor a in their coffee's. I have to ask for extra and if I forget to ask, I am drinking milk basically. :("}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. Breakfast burritos, pastries and an assortment of drinks. Nice courtyard that makes you feel like your not in a concrete jungle."}
{"text":"Ahhh 32 Shea! I came here for a first date (yes it was Tinder lol) and it is a great little spot! I found it randomly by searching \"coffee shops\" on my Maps apps and was very intrigued by the decor and vibe I was seeing. It definitely lived up to my expectations! I wanted a place that both my date and I could enjoy so I liked that they offered coffee/tea AND beer! Haha. Just in case I needed to switch from coffee if ya know what I mean ;) ... just kidding ... The place is in a random location, but quaint and cute and they've done well at making it seem zen and not like you're in the middle of some random plaza and on a major street. It's very small inside but cozy. The patio is great, so pretty visually and birds all around chirpy and happy. 

Pricing was very reasonable IMO and although I'm not much into (or know about) coffee I enjoyed mine! I didn't try the food and haven't been in the evening so I'm definitely looking forward to exploring this unique find a little more.

Great vibes all around! We both really liked the place so needless to say I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"In a town where big chains like Starbuck's & Pete's are covering pretty much every neighborhood, here comes \"32 Shea\" with a great variety of fresh coffees, teas, and delicious food. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.
As I understand it, they are applying for their Beer & Wine License which I think will be one of the first steps to rejuvenating this old run down corner. The intersection of 32nd St & Shea used to be such a major thoroughfare before the freeway extension of the \"SR-51\". This area is still home to a wide variety of individuals who need a fun place with great eats that's not too far away.
After living in Ocean Beach San Diego for 6+ years one becomes a little picky about his or her coffee shops. I was really pleased with the service here and the quality of the coffee. It will nice to see the menu as it grows as well as  having a beer on their awesome patio..."}
{"text":"i love it!  the OMG sandwich is amazing and i often have cravings for it...their nutella mocha is awesome.  well.. anything w/ nutella is awesome :)"}
{"text":"I haven't had a bad meal yet in my dozens of trips, however, the iced coffee needs a bit of work... 

The food is AMAZING! Incredible how they can produce such quality food in such a tiny kitchen. They have skills!

Service is awesome.

Atmosphere is cool.

Is there a chance they'll make this place a bit bigger one day???? But then again, if they increase the size they'll lose the charm."}
{"text":"Cool modern place and friendly staff. A little crowded but mostly because they are busy, so that could be considered a good thing. I always get the southwest burrito and my girlfriend gets the croissant. My burrito could be slightly bigger and come with more verde but delicious. Girlfriend says croissant is good most of the time, no complaints. Drinks vary but typically either a chai, green smoothie or coffee and they are all crafted perfectly. 

All in all I would say is that the place is very cool and a nice weekend spot. The food is good, not over the top but good."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place! It's so out of place in a run-down mall, but we are hoping it will help revive the area. The food is so delicious - we have never had anything bad! They have a different dinner entree and flatbread pizza every night, we actually love that! This way, we get to try new flavors all the time. They have a great patio (dog friendly) and a charming (but small) indoor dining area. The food though, we come for the food. You should too!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the heart of Phoenix. Great ambiance and menu. Service was the best part of my experience with Ericka taking such great care of me. She was welcoming, outgoing, well versed with the menu and absolutely charming. I will be back and look forward to bringing my friends next time :)"}
{"text":"Artichoke & spinach dip was best I've ever had. Lobster mac & cheese was delicious as well. The food is very very rich, but so good.  Also, the place is tiny and adorable!  Great outdoor patio area too. The only unpleasantry I can find is the snobby server who said a total of 9 words."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood coffee house! I think they have the best hot latte I only want theirs, great for breakfast and dinner too!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time to 32nd Shea and it's always great.  Cozy indoor atmosphere and great outdoor space. I don't know how they do it in such a small work space but they do and I would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I have been coming to 32Shea since they opened in 2011. There are a bunch of great things to say, but my main proposal for why you should check them out is that you will be blown away by the design and construction of this business. The building is TINY and they have managed to make enough space for you, your family, your extended family, and all of their close personal friends. 

Pro/Con: The food here is great, though I little pricy for the amount you get. BUT you must splurge for the bruschetta at least once.

Pro/Con: The cafe drinks are usually remarkable, though the consistency has been challenged by (what I attribute to) high employee turnover. BUT NUTELLA. Also, their chai. YUM. 

Pro: The evening drinky drinks have been spot on every time. 

Pro: 32Shea has every single coffee shop in Phoenix beat when it comes to atmosphere. It is extraordinary what they've done with their patio in the last few years. And whether inside or outside, SO romantic in the evenings. It's truly an inspiring space that I love to be in both alone and with company.

Pro: dog-friendly patio

Con: Service, like I said, is spotty. There's been some really cool baristas over the years, but for the most part I've had a hard time keeping track of the ever-changing staff. 

Pro: drive-thru and call-ahead orders

Con: due to space their entry/line system can get a little confusing. 

Pro: Their bathroom has dancing lazer lights, so you don't get bored when you pee like you might at other coffee shops. 

GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I would totally expect this place on Campbell or in Old Town Scottsdale, but just West of the 51 on Shea this is a gem in front of a strip mall. Not knocking that part of town, just saying that this place doesn't fit in! That's a good thing. Awesome atmosphere without the pretentious Scottsdale crowd! Sorry Scottsdale. Hell I'm probably pissing everyone off with this review. 

32 Shea has a great intimate feeling with a great shaded patio and smaller indoor dinning area. Had the perfect burrito coupled with the best Mocha Latte ever! This place has great service as well! Give this place a try, just look for the one place that's not like the others on the corner of 32nd St. and Shea!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved into the neighborhood west of 32 Shea. We have already been there 3 times in two weeks and it has become one of our staples. Excellent selection of wine and beer plus a 6a-6p Happy Hour. The food and desserts are delicious. I really like the bruschetta, roast beef sliders and Nutella cheesecake. Rebecca (sp?), the owner, is very friendly and fun. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was fine. My 2 star review is due to the fact I sat inside on the Sunday morning I was there- the staff were an incredibly loud, ADHD, disruptive, spastic bunch. Five of them were packed behind the bar. The girl seemed overwhelmed with four guys just bouncing off the walls. I highly recommend sitting outside unless of course you're working on a thesis paper entitled \"Observing the Highly Caffeinated Antics of Millenials.\""}
{"text":"This place is nice on a sunny day. The outdoor patio is very comfy and the ambiance is perfect.

My friends and I ate there for lunch and the bread was amazing. This ciabatta was the best ciabatta I've ever had. Crispy yet soft. I recommend a hot sandwich for this type of bread as the bread gets tough when it cools down."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Good coffee, breakfast and lunch options.  The staff and management are great and I'm rooting for this place to keep doing so well."}
{"text":"Unremarkable. 3 of us ordered coffee extra hot. It took forever for the barista to make and came out tepid. He actually took longer to make 3 drinks than it took the kitchen to make our 2 burritos and a sandwich. Food was terribly plain. Burrito came in an awful dry tortilla. Turkey meat was excellent, but the rest of the sandwich left a lot to be desired. Lettuce and tomato contributed to making this sandwich look and feel like a McDonald's sandwich. The patio is beautiful and the inside is clean. This place could be amazing, but the coffee and kitchen need some help."}
{"text":"Hey all! I wanted to write in because my hubby and I moved close by 32 Shea and just love it - the food, wine, the dark but cozy atmosphere and even the service. I don't understand the reviews that go on about the servers having poor attitudes. We've never felt a negative vibe. On the contrary, the servers and owner know our names and even our baby's name. It's so great to have a place that's not the typical chain in your neighborhood. I recommend 32 for sure!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and cute cafe. Was cozy and crowded inside, so it seems to be a local favorite. Nice breakfast; the lox was superb!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place.  

My girlfriend and I were in the area for an appointment and had our Great Danes with us.  We were early for the appointment and hungry for breakfast so when we happened upon this place we were all about it.

The main building isn't that big but they put out some great products.  I ended up with a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich (which was very tasty) and my girlfriend had a bagel with lox, cream cheese, capers and a few other things.  She enjoyed it.  They have a decent selection of coffee and tea drinks that they make.  They also have a drive through, which is very convenient. 

The patio area is dog friendly so of course we brought them over.  This is a pretty chill place and I would recommend it if you are in the area.  I will definitely be back if I am in that part of town again."}
{"text":"I often go to 32 Shea for a pre-work pick-me up, whether it's an iced flavored latte or a Nutella inspired baked good. What I've realized is that their iced flavored lattes are for the latte adventurous- I've tried pistachio, lavender, and mocha, and mocha is still my favorite. I've also tried their hot menu and baked goods, including their New Mexico breakfast burrito. I prefer the baked goods, but that may be because I have a solid sweet tooth, or teeth, if I'm being honest! But the New Mexico breakfast burrito holds its own with avocado, salsa, potatoes, and bacon for morning goodwill. The ambience is very zen, and they have a full bar as well as fountains outside with lots of plant life. If you're looking for a place to hang out, get some work done, or just zone out and day dream, 32 Shea is the place to be."}
{"text":"The coffee and chai tea is awesome here, as are the people who work here. What should be revisited is the entire work space and ordering process. Customers get bottle-necked at the front door and this makes for a frustrating customer experience.  Again, this is not meant to take away from the awesome menu, but this whole restaurant/coffee bar could be rearranged to make for a better ordering experience. This restaurant should also consider adding a back door to the patio for more congruency in the layout of the coffee shop. Last note: Excellent chai with soy!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Horrible bloody marys and wait staff had no clue what they were doing."}
{"text":"Outstanding in every way..,.it was my first time there. The service was very warm and welcoming, and the bruschettas were superb. My friend and I enjoyed a nice glass of Pinot noir. Lovely setting, easy to get to. A must try! My favorite was the prosciutto bruschetta with figs and honey."}
{"text":"I really liked 32 Shea! Kinda wish there was a place like this in my neighborhood. It's a really cute place in a pretty random location - smackdab in the middle of the parking lot of a strip mall (it used to be a drive through coffee shop). They've remade it into a cool, hip little spot and managed to fit quite a lot into a small space. There's an outdoor patio that they've surrounded with trees, which, once the weather cools off, will give the outside area a little more ambiance. Inside, there is a small bar and maybe eight 2 top tables (not the type of place to take large groups). Luckily we were able to get a table right away. 

32 Shea serves breakfast, lunch, drinks, and coffee (they have a drivethrough). I heard the coffee is excellent. We went there for happy hour and I ordered the Mint Lemon Drop Martini which might be one of my favorite drinks around! Very fresh and lemony. I also had the Shea Breeze (muddled pineapple, vodka, cranberry, soda, and lime). It was good, but I had already fallen for that lemon martini. My boyfriend enjoyed a couple of their local beers. 

We also had a few bruschettas: the salami/pesto/tomato, the proscuitto/marscarpone/figs/honey, and the mozzarella/tomato/basil. I'd say they're on par with the likes of postino's and I'd definitely order all three again. We also really enjoyed the roast beef sliders. A little horseradish and some good au jus."}
{"text":"I went to this neat little coffee shop after I went to a consignment store in Scottsdale and the owners of Hidden Closet said you want good coffee in our convo go to to this neat coffee house at 32nd st,. Shea. I had an Iced coffee great and much better then Starbucks and more reasonable. Some should thank the owner at Hidden Closet they send all there customers there"}
{"text":"Great place, fair prices.  Outdoor patio is nice, you would never know you were in a parking lot.  Kids enjoyed as well, especially the bathroom.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I spent Christmas with family in Phoenix, and after taking a walk with the dog at Dreamy Draw Park, we went looking for a place we could go to lunch without dropping the dog off at home first. We found 32 Shea through Yelp, only 1.5 miles from where we were, and it was just about perfect.

It was not easy to spot for those of use who weren't local, despite the fact that it's right out there by the street. Once we found it, though, we knew we'd picked a good spot. The enclosed patio was lovely, with a cute little fire hydrant water tap and bowls set up for dogs.

We had glasses of wine and a table that got a little sun. For a northerner, eating outside in December is quite the novelty, and I was going to get as much sun as I could in the process. The sandwiches and salads hit the spot.

My one \"if only\" concerns the lunchtime menu options. There was veg stuff, but it looked like asking for it without cheese would make it uninteresting. There were hummusy things on the dinner menu but not on the lunch. I ended up getting the tuna sandwich without cheese and figuring I'd pretend it didn't probably have mayo. I suppose I could also have asked if substituting hummus for cheese on the veg sandwich, but I may never know now."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the last several years.  Funky and tasty.  But I am currently craving it as I recollect my most recent visit. First of all they have an amazing tuna sandwich.  Apples. In the tuna.  Yum!  And they have a grapefruit martini that is totally incredible. Odd combo?  Maybe. But so good!"}
{"text":"I've had bad experiences at this cafe in the past but I hear it has made some good changes over the years. Might be worth checking it out again"}
{"text":"OMG! I'm a huge breakfast fan and this place has nailed it! The food was delicious, fresh & done right. The Early Bird Sandwich is so freakin good, the egg nice and fluffy (made me a little worried when I seen it), bacon nice & crispy, the perfect amount of avocado & mayo! My son had the New Mexico Burrito it was also really good! For coffee I had the Nutella Latte and it was the perfect balance of flavor, not too sweet so it was perfect for me. I can't wait to go back for happy hour (6am-6pm) WOW! A little tip if you are going when it's extremely hot outside, they have very limited indoor seating but a very nicely shaded outdoor area. Be prepared to sit outside no matter what time you go! Overall I really love this place!"}
{"text":"The drinks are amazing. The food is fabulous. They are always so busy and usually the servers are running around. Like any where, some seem pretty uninterested. The chef fortunately makes up for the table service. Which, I think table service doesn't even start till 4p. Before that it's a multi-tasking bar/barista. Great spot. The owner surly know how to design a place, make good drinks, and good food."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday for lunch with my mom and dad.  I'm pretty sure this used to be one of those photo huts when I was growing up.  The place is tiny inside.  Cute, but a bit noisy.  If it was cooler outside, it would have been great to sit on the patio.  

The sandwiches were good.  I had the turkey which I thought was a bit bland, but you could tell it was made with good ingredients.  My dad had a BLT that he said was excellent, and my mom had the roast beef sandwich with the horseradish cream sauce.  I wish I had gotten that!!!!  It was delicious!  Next time I go back, I will have that for sure.

Their coffees looked nice, and I would like to try them as well.

I will be going back for that sandwich.  It's a very cute little place.  Nice addition to 32nd Street!  Good to see a little gem in the old neighborhood."}
{"text":"Oh hey, everything likable about Phoenix cafes.

- dope hipster tunage 
- cafe-to-speakeasy shapeshifting abilities from morning to evening
- better coffee than most coffee shops
- the awesome tuna sandwich on great bread official third-party seal of approval
- high quality ingredients, but very simple fare
- a virtually unlimited supply of Nutella (okay, not in most Phoenix cafes, but should be)

Yes, 32 Shea, just yes."}
{"text":"The Buddhist-peace theme on the patio was kind of wrecked as I had to listen to a song by a black musician railing against \"mother f#&ker's\" and \"niggers\". Huh? What kind of lunch is that? Who picked that station?

Also, I have to admit it is over priced by about $1.50-$2 per entree. At least mine was."}
{"text":"I love this little place! They have done some great work on their patio to up the aesthetics. It very nice out there with the trees, lighting, and little waterfall. A great spot to go on a beautiful AZ spring or fall night. 

I've been there both during lunch and dinner. They have signature sandwiches and salads to chose from, I like their caprese sandwich. Super yummy! It's a nice spot that offers some healthier options and good ingredients. 

I would recommend coming here during their happy hour and sit to have a glass of wine and some artichoke dip on their patio! Perfection. Their staff is always incredibly friendly and accommodating. 

Another great thing about their patio is that it's pet friendly. They even have hooks for leashes and water bowls on hand for your pups. It's locally owned and I love when you can feel the warmth and dedication in a spot and 32 Shea exudes that."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm not a yelper whatsoever! But I couldn't not post about this place!! I'm in the hospitality industry so my standards are very high!!! This is Such a little gem, I go weekly! So consistent with there food, the patio is amazing and I take my puppy all the time! The staff are ahhhmazing as well!!! LOVE THIS PLACE  

Get the lox bagel!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so versatile. There's a drive thru that's open until 4pm. Their coffee is delicious! The patio area is beautiful and also dog friendly! It's a great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner! It's even great for just enjoying some drinks on the patio! I just visited this place for the first time about a month ago and I've been back at least 4 times!"}
{"text":"What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT !!! Went here for lunch and I have been excited to try this place very cute and quaint , the menu sounded delicious and the staff was friendly enough . My review is based solely off of portion size and quality of freshness . I ordered the lunch caprese salad and asked the guy if it was a big salad or should I order something else to go along with it he said no that salad was big enough . I got it to go and when I got home I was very surprised with what they call a salad ?  there were 4 slices of mozzarella which was an ok portion but there was 4 tiny shreds of lettuce on top that did not even cover the cheese not surround it oh And some rotting tomatoes ? It was not even edible besides the cheese I really wanted to like this place but don't think know that I will be returning :("}
{"text":"\"Let's have coffee!\" Amanda B. said.
So I got there early. I hooked myself up to super fast wi-fi. I cursed myself for having stuffed myself already as the menu looked delicious. After hugs were shared I watched enviously as Amanda returned to the table with wine. At lunch time.

Apparently Happy Hour is a twelve hour thing.
TWELVE HOURS.

Did you hear me?
(Dine in only. This is stipulated on the menu. Who tries to take HH to go? Apparently SOME PEOPLE. 32 Shea does have a drive thru.)

So from 6AM to 6PM folks can enjoy the following:
$4 bottled craft beer
$5 wine, mimosa, bloody mary
$6 martinis, cocktails

AND then (!) they have a 2-hr munchie hour
4pm-6pm (again, dine in only kids)
$3 bruschetta
$5 munchie menu (which they put on the chalk board)

See here's the thing. If you're a writer, this place is dangerous. You'd never get a damn thing done. You'd show up bright and early for breakfast (which is served until noon), enjoy coffee, move onto a smoothie and then lunch. (The green smoothie is *excellent*.) At some point a beve would make sense, right? And then, well, it's drinking time?

This is an adorable cozy space. You will fall in love with it. Oops! I got all sorts of excited and left something out. You place your order up front at the cashier and food is brought to you. Tables are cleared for you. 

I took a menu to keep in my car. YES, I did that. This place isn't in my neck of the woods. However, I cannot wait to grab food the next opportunity I'm up here again!

UPDATE: While you're here be sure to try the New Mexican burrito. The green salsa is to die for. (I'm hoping they start selling this to go soon.) Garlic, jalapeños, cilantro, tomatoes, onion, and some other heaven. I can't remember what else Rebecca, the super cool owner, described with zest. She's currently sporting purple short hair. All the employes rock. There's a punky and fun vibe going on here. Good times :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Bonus points 'cause it's in my hood.

What's not to love about a 32 Shea?  Not just anyone can turn a vacant fast food restaurant in a strip mall parking lot into a top notch coffee shop.  But the awesome doesn't end there.  By day, they are a coffee shop that serves delicious food, has a full bar and some of the coolest, most fun baristas in the city.  By night, 32 Shea is the perfect place to grab a glass of wine and some amazing bruschetta, or the dinner of the day with an delicious craft beer or even a lavosh pizza and a mint lemon drop martini (holy yumminess). 

The homemade green salsa and bloody mary mix are not to be missed!

**Friend 32 Shea on Facebook or follow them on Twitter to make sure you never miss out on the awesome daily deals they offer.  Another bonus is that you will always know what the dinner of the day is!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for a drink and a bite. I always like to go at dusk on warm evenings and sit outside on the patio, which is truely wonderful. This is a small place, intimate and welcoming and the food is lite and excellent. The edibles are perfect with a variety of sandwiches and salads as well as bruschetta, everything fresh and savory. The bruschetta is wonderful and the variety is impressive. While my husband and I have gone for a light dinner and to split a bottle of wine this is not somewhere to go if you are looking for a full blown or heavy dinner. It is however a perfect place to go for a first date, coffee date, drive through morning excellence, nightcap and light desert. This is an impressive neighborhood staple and has made an impression far and wide. It just kinda feels like your sitting in your best friends living-room listening to music and sipping a martini."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast, brunch or dinner (never been for lunch yet).  Love their dog friendly outside patio and the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, food is great, coffee is great.  Service is usually good, but there are no high chair's, so its not really \"Good for Kids\".  I know the inside is very tight, but the patio has room."}
{"text":"The coffee here was really good.  The food was \"okay.\"  I've tried the turkey sandwich and the early bird sandwich.  The early bird sandwich was good, but not sure it's worth the price since I could probably make it myself.  It comes on regular old sandwich bread and you don't get any sides.  I bet this place is more fun at night when it's a wine bar."}
{"text":"So yesterday I had a training right near this little place and I went here....twice.....whoa. I went in the morning and had the nutella mocha....now, I don't even really like mochas that much, but this was a completely different story. It wasn't too sweet, but it was sweet, and it had that nutty and delicious Nutella flavor.....oh my. Thank god I don't live near here or I would be spending a lot of money and calories on this delicious drink. Anyway, I came back for lunch (but they were still serving breakfast). I got their New Mexican breakfast burrito and it was alright, but not as good as many say. I really like the green chili sauce that came with the burrito, but the burrito itself was pretty generic. Anyway, I would like to come back and try their lunch or dinner food and I will definitely be back for a nutella mocha (but not too soon!)."}
{"text":"Love it! It is close and convenient. The food was good. The staff was very helpful. I like the atmosphere.

It is very small so we sat outside. I would go there again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant in the past. Good food and good service. Went there tonight and sat on their patio with our dog. Only 3 other tables occupied. The waitress walked in and out of the restaurant 5 times without so much as a mention that she would \"be with us in a minute\" Left after being ignored for 35 minutes. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I can't really add anything to the exceptional reviews 32 Shea has earned. I'll just say that I wish I lived closer so I could stop in more often. Integrity in service, great vibe and local. Keep doing what you're doing, guys."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Initially I thought this was a drive thru coffee stand. To my surprise they serve breakfast, lunch dinner and happy hour. An adorable pet friendly patio that was busy what look like with local patrons. Inside tables and bar seating. Cozy fit and counter service for lunch. Check out the unique bathroom. The entire staff was extremely friendly and going the extra mile to make every guest welcome."}
{"text":"I love Shea 32 for the amazing patio and laid back vibe. I was surprised to find this little gem in a half empty strip mall at the edge of a residential neighborhood. I have now been there a number of times- both for lunch and dinner- and have liked everything I tried. They have a killer sandwich called the OMG that I just can't get enough of - figs, prosciutto, mascarpone and honey on perfectly chewy ciabatta. For dinner they have excellent Bruschetta as well as revolving daily specials and an excellent wine selection. This is the perfect place for a romantic dinner outside on the Patio in the cooler months."}
{"text":"Such a cute coffee shop with good vibes and good drinks! Their nutella coffee and lavender latte are my favorite!"}
{"text":"The food is always top notch and the so are the drinks.  Come to think of it so is the vibe and the service, so I guess that makes it a no brainer.  It has some constants on the menu that are all good and everyday there is a new entree which has always been awesome.  Go check it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"What!? Yelp weekly didn't mention 32 Shea...THEY HAVE S'MORE LATTES!! So yummy. They have great holiday drinks. I also love the peppermint WHITE mocha!"}
{"text":"I love locals.  I love anyone who will go through the trouble, and hard work, to open a place of business.  Let me tell you, seeing the condition of this building when my wife and I first moved into the neighborhood; the owners wanted to REALLY open this place because they had to put A LOT of work into it.  But, no surprise, it has paid off.

First off, I am more of a tea (Chai, yum!) than a coffee person, so I can't speak to the taste of their coffee drinks, but they smell fantastic!

My hot chai from here, is ALWAYS great.  Always hot, without being too hot, and has a consistent flavor each time.  

The food (sandwiches, salads, and coming soon, soups) always look and smell very fresh.

I have had the:

Early Bird (Egg, Tomato, Avocado and Mayo on English muffin (with your choice of bacon or turkey)

New Mexico Burrito (Egg, Potatoes, Cheese, Avocado, Bacon) and a side of homemade Green Salsa (not a lot of heat, which I like, but still very taste),

Stacked Turkey (Tomato, Lettuce, Avocado, Provolone, Mustard+Mayo)

I would recommend all three, and will recommend other foods too, as soon as I tear myself away from the above. :)

I am looking forward to when they get to have beer/wine dinner events, and I don't want to forget to mention the retro Pepsi (in glass bottles!).

Please visit this place, you will enjoy the pleasant interior, or gorgeous outdoor seating and the very reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"Always solid. Been here for happy hour, breakfast burritos, and coffee. Everything is top-notch and the service is fantastic. I love the attention to detail that they put into all their work--especially the breakfast burritos! Check them out. (You can even call ahead, plus they have a drive thru!) Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have only been by for coffee and breakfast and it is one if my favs! The coffee is great and the lox bagel is AMAZING! You must at least stop by to try their coffee."}
{"text":"Very interesting place especially in the afternoon great crowd good customer service highly recommend you may have to spend a little extra but I think it's worth it give it a shot I don't think you will regret it"}
{"text":"Really cute but unorganized. Not a lot of room to stand if ordering takeout. Coffee was very good and service was friendly."}
{"text":"32 Shea is a great place for a meeting, casual brunch, or laid-back dinner. We come here often when we want good food in a relaxed atmosphere. It's also great for a casual work meeting place, as there's plenty inside and outside seating and the noise level is low.

Staff is always friendly and the food is pretty good. I wish there were more neighborhood-type restaurants like this around."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito is AMAZING! Outstanding service, delicious coffee, and the place itself is super cute and unique. Definitely recommend this spot, its a gem."}
{"text":"As a Phoenix native, back for the holidays, I was looking forward to enjoying an old favorite of mine. I I used to frequent 32 Shea when it first opened, and since moving away, make an attempt to eat there at least twice whenever I am back I town. I was looking forward to a quality meal in a lovely atmosphere. The restaurant was a little empty, so I was expecting maybe a softer atmosphere, but to my surprise, the manager seemed to just talk louder at her employees. My cocktails were prepared incorrectly by the same manager who seemed more eager to close up early than to pay attention to the patrons. I was unclear as to who I should order from as people informed her she had a diner and she just ordered the others to do tasks for her, while she reminisced about drinking and talked about leaving for her new job. She infantilized her employees as though talking to small children, when some of them seemed to be older and more mature than her. The food, per usual was amazing, but the single individual who seemed more than happy to be gone and starting a new job while brushing all responsibility off onto her employees, all but ruined my meal. Next time I will stick to the outside seating area. Thank you for continuing to provide quality food!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Excellent coffee, great food, and the people that work here are awesome! Love the atmosphere and they have a drive through!!"}
{"text":"Love our favorite local coffee shop, 32 Shea. Everything here is amazing. The cocktails, the coffee, the food, and the service! I recommend calling ahead if you're going to go through the drive through. The lavender white mocha is my favorite coffee drink - I highly recommend! If you've never been here, you must try it!"}
{"text":"Cutest little coffee shop that turns into a bar on the evenings. I met a girlfriend here for brunch and coffee. It was delicious and I just love the look of the place. It's a fun date night or a good spot to bring the laptop to get some work done. Love little gems like this!"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed to leave a negative review. I have been a regular at 32 Shea for almost 4 years. I fell in love with it when I came here for lunch, and decided to come back for breakfast and coffee. Their coffee is amazing and their food is really good, for good prices. 

However, the experience and service is extremely inconsistent. I ordered breakfast this morning and waited 45 minutes for it. 3 other couples that ordered after I did; they received their food, ate it, and left before I even had a chance to ask them where my order went. 

When it was brought to my table, it was placed in front of me with no, \"sorry about the wait,\" or explanation as to what happened. 

I know you are a small, local business trying to make it work. Consistency is what builds a brand and builds success - I think you need some help standardizing the expectations for your employees to ensure guests receive the same, great experience time and time again. 

I invite you to visit 32 Shea for great food and even better drinks, but it'll be hit or miss on timing and guest service."}
{"text":"The restaurant has been sold, so I will reserve judgement of that for 6 months to see what the new owners do. Good things I hope."}
{"text":"I arrived at the funky lil joint this morning, and was pleasantly surprised that I did not have to sit in the long stream of cars in the drive-thru line. The gentleman at the window was friendly and patient, he suggested the Vanilla/Honey Latte Iced, this was my first experience here so I was grateful for the suggestion. It was FANTASTIC! I also ordered the breakfast burrito which was delicious, (their home made salsa was perfect) & it did NOT weigh 10lbs so I still feel fantastic after devouring it, not like I want to curl up, clenching my stomach, and sleep for 10 days. The service was also prompt, and the gal who walked my order out to my car was super friendly! Prices were very reasonable as well! This experience sure beats out the long line, hasty service, tiny over-priced cups of joe, and hard pastrys, at your local chain Starbucks. They also serve a great variety of craft brews and wines and, have a comfy, dog friendly, patio! I will definitely be back when I am in the area again! Support LOCAL, check this place out, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place but they'll have to step it up for that to happen. For you speed readers, here's the nutshell: GOOD FOOD, pleasant but *very* slow service, smallish but tasty menu, good beer list, okay wine list, awesome dog-friendly patio with a fountain, great music and vibe. Great features on certain nights of the week (see photos). So tonight, my first time here, I came at 6:30 in the evening, in time for a gorgeous AZ sunset on their awesome little [less than half full] patio, but sadly too late for happy hour. Next time... First and foremost, service was so so so slow. I've been in the industry for twenty years, as a server and manager at places from Chili's to Chelsea's to Mary Elaine's so I totally know and consider all the little cogs moving inside a restaurant \"machine\" during service. I even took into consideration that I was alone, thus more sensitive to the passing of time. My server was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, but he simply needed more support. From what I could tell, he had the twelve table patio all by himself with only one other gentleman bussing and refilling waters. That is simply too much to balance in order to give proper service (but remember I mentioned it was less than half full when I arrived...? No good reason for such slow service). That being said, the food was very fresh and tasty, and worth the prices. I got the daily lavosh pizza and it was TO DIE FOR. Crispy prosciutto, almond slices, diced apples, mozzarella, and arugula. Wow. They have a nice beer list, a few fun craft cocktails, and an okay wine list, which needs to be updated. I ordered a bottle (1/2 off bottles on Monday -- yes please!), but twenty five minutes later when it finally arrived (yes, 25 min, I actually clocked it.. my hummus app arrived first, which was 23 min after ordering) it was a completely different bottle than listed on the menu. I actually only noticed bc the vintage was different. Nbd as by that point I just wanted a flipping glass of wine already and it was actually quite good. 
Inside is super cute and I can tell they have good decorating sense though it needs some sprucing up (new paint, at least in the restroom). *Love* all the plants hanging around. Overall it's a quaint little local spot, but I'll just keep it in the back of my mind that I should come here expecting service to be slow. That way maybe I'll be impressed if it's better next time."}
{"text":"I'm a huge espresso coffee drinker and their \"Nutella Mocha\" is, by far, my favorite espresso drink in the Phoenix Metro. Plus, it's the cheapest around way below Starbucks' outrageous prices!
A highly recommended place with a nicely decorated patio and very friendly service."}
{"text":"I really liked this place but the last three times I've come here the price of my beverage has changed each time.  I always order a breve with baileys and it's gone from around $5 to over $10 this time.  Over $10 for a coffee with baileys is insane especially when you sell mimosas and bloody Mary's for $5!  The most expensive coffee drink is $4.75, just don't get it.  I've been here 3 times and come out of my way to go to this place.  Sadly this will be my last time here."}
{"text":"Lovely place with a friendly, easy going and prompt staff.   My friend lives in the area and assumed it's just a coffee shop so the \"is she serious?\" look she had as she walked up was priceless.  The moscow mule I had was perfect and the bruschetta was very tasty.    Will definitely return for more, am very curious to try the nutella mocha."}
{"text":"Our fave neighborhood hangout. Hike the preserve daily and often end the morning with coffee and a breakfast burrito (large enough to split).  Dog friendly patio works for us. Nighttime is relaxing, food and atmosphere great. We love being here."}
{"text":"I love this little place! They have amazing sandwiches and salads. My personal favorites are the roast beef sandwich, chopped salad, and passion fruit iced tea.  The atmosphere is great with a nice little outdoor patio for a beautiful day, which we have many of in AZ! If you're in the area you must check it out for lunch!"}
{"text":"It's not the size that matters when it comes to food . 32 Shea will knock your socks off. Fresh ingredients but together in innovative ways . The salads and baked goods are amazing . I had a peach and rosemary muffin this morning and omg was it ever amazing . I will be back for a cocktail or two ... I hope !"}
{"text":"32 Shea is my go-to place for coffee, lunch and happy hour. I work nearby and stop by a few times a week. It's such a cute place. The decor is fabulous and the patio is delightful. Such a great place to hang out with a glass of wine.


 The coffee is excellent and I've never had any issues in the drive-thru. I've tried a few of their limited/ seasonal lattes and they've all been great. The lunch menu is excellent- the salads and sandwiches are incredible. Try the tuna and the omg.

I've never had any issues with long wait times. In fact, I'm amazed at how quickly they get food out- the kitchen is miniscule."}
{"text":"Cute spot.  Actually exactly what I was looking for, a coffee shop that wasn't a Starbucks.  Enjoyed the lavender latte and steel cut oatmeal with fruit.  Small, but yummy.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Stop in for a bite pretty good made fresh the people were friendly and nice ambiance they have a nice patio area to sit in outside. 
The only draw back is the outside patio has several spots without shade."}
{"text":"What a great transformation this establishment has made and brought to this shopping center!

I'll always remember the original building and how 32 Shea looked when it first opened. It is now extremely unique, beautiful iron fencing, the landscape has grown in so well; the patio area just looks phenomenal! The young woman who had the dream of opening this place should be very proud!  

I ordered the Juicy Roast Beef & it's unbelievable! I highly recommend! The horseradish is not overpowering and the cool tomatoes are a nice pairing with the warm roast beef... Love!!!"}
{"text":"This place is elite. With very small square footage Café 32 delivers the most satisfaction per square foot of retail space as any place I've seen in Phoenix. The lovely owner takes great pride in her café and it shows. The lovely female baristas are very polite and so are the male baristas. The seating inside can be cramped but not bad, outside seating is very nice.

I had lunch there today and my sandwich was exceptional ( roast beef).

I will try dinner after I find a nice GF.

So, if you like good espresso made the right way, Café 32 is it."}
{"text":"We went to this place several years ago and stopped for some reason I really don't remember why. So we discovered it again and loved the atmosphere so we stayed coming back, had good food and friendly staff the first two times we came but not today not even close. We sat close to 30 minutes after we ordered waiting for our food, people were showing up ordering and getting their food and we still weren't getting our order. (A burrito we were splitting) After I was thoroughly annoyed my wife went in and asked, bla, bla, bla they'd have it out as soon as they could a few minutes later we got an over nuked disgusting chunk we couldn't even eat after a good try though we left what was left of what some third world country folk would maybe accept on the table and walked out. Perhaps this is why we stopped coming before. Maybe in a few years when I forget this terrible experience I'll try it again ."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant/ coffee house, food was delicious, staff was super friendly. We happened to be in the area and noticed it was an unexpected surprise. We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are someone that is interested in immediate service and subpar coffee then 32 Shea isn't the place for you. 32 Shea has a little bit of a wait but it's more than worth it! I have yet to have a cup of coffee that was anything but exceptional. My only qualm with the place is that it's pretty small and crowded on the inside, but they have an outdoor patio that is quite accommodating. So if you have the opportunity to stop by here in the early afternoon that's the time I would suggest!"}
