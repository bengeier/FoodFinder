{"text":"I had lunch there today.  I have fruity puris and channa bhatura.  Along with gulab and chai.  The service was okay the waiter wasn't so great and very slow.  The food was very salty well At least the bhatura was or the Channa I couldn't quite tell. The mint water with the puris was unbelievably salty I was shocked.  The dessert and chai was absolutely amazing.  So really I would give this restaurant 3.7 stars.  My dining companion had butter chicken and rice his rice was hard and seemed like it had been sitting out for a while and the butter chicken was very good but a bit seeeter than I like and slightly too much cardamom.  Oh yeah the grossest thing was the curry or grease marks on the water bottles and menus.  They need to disinfect the bottles or something. So Actually on 3.0 stars. That was gross"}
{"text":"We came here on Christmas Eve. Thankfully we had made a reservation a week beforehand because many people were turned down. Reservations can be done online, very convenient and practical.   The place was full and no surprise there; celebrity chef name, it's a branded restaurant.  Service top notch.   Ambience perfect.  Food was on the bland side. And it does bring the review down by many points. Food is what carries through and matters most. The menu looked so promising, very different so we ordered a bunch of curries and lots of appetizers. Sadly there wasn't any one item that made us feel like wow this is delish. It was all pretty basic and I was disappointed that certain food didn't have the right flavour and tasted bland. Bland food especially when in comes to Indian delicacies is personally a big let down. I don't want to reach out for salt and pepper while enjoying my paneer.  I wouldn't recommend for a second visit. People do go due to the name/reputation but sadly it does not live up to it."}
{"text":"Good service ! Decent Ambiance ! Little over priced food, taste was good but missing the wow factor ! Chef needs to be consistent with the dessert ingredients and plating :( I went with my family for dinner. The food we ordered was made heavy and rich so felt heavy after eating. The Lalla mussa dal had good flavour but needs more texture to it as it had too much of liquid consistency.  The Pooran singh Chicken lacks the flavour and had a very basic curry with three boiled pieces of chicken- not happy ! The other disappointment was the dessert which took long after we ordered and the plating was not how it looked in the picture we saw. Actually, I noticed that the pictures posted online had different style of plating. The fruits were laid out differently on the plate and some plates were missing the fruits as in the other pictures. I would expect consistency and perfection without any excuses for a celebrity chef restaurant.  My kids wanted the Kulfi with an umbrella as in the picture but the glass was different and umbrella missing and overall looked different so do not expect to have the same appearance as you saw or had last time !!  The grill and Tandoor items were perfectly cooked and had a very fresh taste. Full marks on those items.   Starters are really good and unique  Chutneys and dipping sauces were also unique and flavourful   Quick Summary  Service - 4/5 cant be better for me :) delayed our dessert and dessert plating was not upto the standards  Ambiance - 4/5 (I prefer little quite place and don't like to see Hindi shows on all the TV's)  Taste - 3.5/5  Value for money - 3/5 expect   Price per person : $30-$50 per person depending on what drinks you pick"}
{"text":"We had very high hopes for this restaurant...I've watched Sanjeevs shows and admire his style. The ambience of the restaurant was good, the decor pleasing.  We went as a family of 4. Our teenage son has a nut allergy and we always ask which dishes we can order. The initial server was quiet, didn't make eye contact and mumbled a hello AFTER I engaged him. It was not a good first impression. He me mentioned a couple of dishes that he said were the only ones nut free (like 4 off the whole menu) and left.   Thankfully another server who was more welcoming came by and took our order...he was a bit more helpful and friendly and basically gave us some more options than the precious one.   Food was good, but I wasn't wowed."}
{"text":"We came here for our parents anniversary. When we entered in a Wednesday evening the place was barely a quarter full. First thing I realized was that it was really quiet and the atmosphere wasn't alive - seemed dead.  I went here with some expectations and it started out well. The chicken appetizers were great. Fresh white meat. However I found it odd that our apps came within minutes of ordering them.  In fact they came while still ordering our meals within 3-5 minutes of ordering the apps! Apps were delicious but in that time they had to be precooked and heated.  We had the lamb chops as well and they were nice and tender. They also have papardum free on the table - tasty as well with their yogurt dips (mango achar flavor and green chutney flavor.)  However everything was way overpriced and downhill from there.  Bottles of beer were $8 each. The naans were expensive but tasty. My issue was with the main dishes. We ordered 3 of the chicken dishes and one mutton curry. The meat used was not good quality at all. Brown chewy meat with no white meat in sight! Portions were comparatively small.  I expected better.  Curries were tasty but without the good meat it was just not worthy. Ambience was just mediocre. Staff was great but seemed like they were up selling stuff even though they gave us some lentils to try for free. Overall I've had better food for cheaper and with a variety of other places in the area I don't think I'll return.  Wanted to give a high rating but can't :-/"}
{"text":"True to the expectation. I expected the food to taste something new and definitely got a few good surprises.  The gulab jamun with paan filling should not be missed if you have a sweet tooth.  Dum aaloo taste different and amazing.  Service was ok but nothing that would stop us from going there again."}
{"text":"Went with Family for the 1st time: here's the good bad and ugly!!  Good Ambience. Good Service, it's fast and polite. Food lacks flavour, quality and variety. Everything is relative, compared to other restaurants the food is just not good,  irrespective of the elevated price. The ambience and service really doesn't help if the food is not up to par with fine dining. It doesn't do justice to good Indian food. My expectations were high given that they have a famous chef backing them but with due respect it's like most other Indian joints pre made gravies spiced up very generic, but not for the discerning palate."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  They catered an event at my house over the summer. It was a fiasco: cold food, untrained wait staff, food was terrible-filled with cream no matter which dish. It was one of the worst catering experiences of my life, and I regret wasting so much money that evening; beyond the bad taste that my guests had.  There was no apology, but they gave us a $200 gift card even though I wanted a refund for the worst food ever catered.   Booked a table of 15 with a preset menu for this past weekend. Once again was met with the worst service ever. The food was late, the drinks were late. They have an obese staff member who audibly made a remark the moment our party of 15 sat down down that we did not deserve good service because we were only paying $40 per person.   I was so totally offended but I had guests and we were there to celebrate an achievement. So we went along with the poor service and attitude. I paid in full and vowed to never return again.  I hope the restaurant team reads this, and know that you truly cemented what awful restauranteurs you are. We had guests who own tens of restaurants in the group and all they could comment on was your terrible service. It was embarrassing."}
{"text":"My parents and I have been trying a bunch of Indian restaurants in the Brampton/Mississauga area, and I was recommended by a friend of mine to try out this restaurant.   Here's my break down of the review:  1) Ambiance, service, seating area - Excellent  2) Food:  Knowing that this restaurant is owned by Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, we expected it to be great. However it did not meet our exceptions. Mind you, we are vegetarians, so we do not know how the meat dishes taste.   We ordered the following:   a) Mixed grill veg b) Lalla Musa Dal c) Anglo Indian Zalfreize (the worst dish out of the all by the way) d) Mutter Jeera Pulao e) Butter Naan, Roti, Mint Paratha f) Shaam Savera  Out of the above, the Shaam Savera which consists of spinach and cottage cheese. There was no flavour to it, it was bland. You can also tell that the cottage cheese was very dry, despite it being in gravy.   The Anglo Indian Zalfreize was the worst. If Chef Sanjeev Kapoor came to know of this, I assume he would be in shock. The chefs did not use fresh vegetables. They used frozen vegetables, and for the gravy, they added tomato ketchup. My mom makes the same dish, and traditionally speaking, you do not use frozen vegetables for this. I don't know if the chefs got lazy or not, but this is unacceptable.   3) The total price we paid including the sweet lassi which by itself is expensive compared to other restaurants, and it was not the greatest, it came to $90 before taxes.   Overall, we would not recommend this place, and for the price paid, its not worth it. It is definitely a hype, as I've been to better places such as Tavva Indian Bistro, and Avani Asian Indian Cuisine which are far better off in terms of food quality and pricing."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner the other day with very high expectations. We ordered multiple apps, panner (basil cilantro tikkas), Tandoori Aalo Nazakat, Harippa Paneer Tikka. All were great but nothing spectacular as we were expecting.  The service was average, I had to ask multiple times for a lime for my drink. Our server was courteous but spead thin between tables.  The apps were better than the entrées, so maybe wants to fill up on apps.  The ambiance was nice, but the large room lends to a lot of noise.  With some training and a bit tweaking of the menu this could be a great restaurant, until then may want to try someplace else."}
{"text":"Loved the flavors.  Service was wonderful. Only negative was seeing the mall around the location.  I'd block off the windows better and we would be truly transported to an exotic place. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, though they have an impressive menu, not all the food items mentioned are available. Its an expensive place to eat out considering cheaper alternatives available in few kms radius"}
{"text":"Incredibly inventive Indian food! Gives Toronto Indian food that comes close to the quality that you experience now in Indian. Excellent presentation and high quality with superb service!"}
{"text":"Pretty busy place...weekend is always house full...service is bit slow but food is amazing...price is high!! Overall give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad to finally have a good Indian food destination in Brampton! The food is delicious and there are some unique items on the menu.   Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I am a sucker of good and bad restaurants reviews by the likes of Chris Nuttal-Smith, Joanne Kates and Amy Pataki. Pity there is no Zagat rating available for Toronto. Zagat rating is done by the diners and not by professional food critics only. Canadian restaurant reviews are provided by professional critics who bring in their expertise of the food they know well but not the Indian cuisine.   Based on an excellent review in Toronto Star, we went on an excursion to KHAZANA on Airport Road. KHAZANA operates under the banner of Chef Sanjiv Kapoor who may be likened to Gordon Ramsey of India. He is a successful chef but operates from remote. He is not physically present in the restaurant. Such franchised or licensing operations have always disappointed me like Cafe Boulud at the Four Seasons in Toronto. KHAZANA was no exception. Now to the review of Khazana.    I will start with the welcome ceremony and the service. It is probably the best of all Indian restaurants in Toronto. The wait staff is pleasant and caring. The food ordered by us was a total disappointment. This review qualifies the dishes that we ordered and not a blanket for the whole menu. We ordered 3 dishes on the menu and garlic Naan and Lachha Paratha ( unleavened bread  ). The 3 dishes are:   1) Baingan Ka Bhartha with green Peas and spices ( Mashed Eggplant and Peas ). I know this dish well as I make it myself regularly. This dish was a total disappointment, including the look. One could hardly taste the flavour of an eggplant. My friend thought it was a turnip mash or a mushroom mash. The dark colour threw me off. A good egg plant mash is smokey and semi blonde colour and slightly grainy. The Bhartha obviously was put through a blender depriving the true texture and the flavour of an eggplant.  2) SHAAM SAVERA ( Evening and Morning ) is billed as the signature dish of the restaurant. The dish has a beautiful look. Spinach Koftas, served half, float on a red/ orange creamy sauce. I believe there were total of 6 halves. The spinach Kofta was filled with cottage cheese. The spinach crust was hard and did not taste like spinach. The creamy sauce was overwhelming and did not allow any breathing to the flavours of the spinach and the cottage cheese. Good looking but disappointing.  3) Kuta Gosht Mutter ( Minced lamb and green peas in spices). This was a total disappointment. The minced lamb was overcooked and dry. There were no garnishes of any kind excepting a scallion. In fact, there were no garnishes on any of the dishes. Normally Indian dishes are garnished with tomatoes, sliced ginger, onions and cilantro. Without these garnishes, the dark brown colour of Kuta Gosht Mutter and Baingan Ka Bhartha looked unattractive.  Oh yes, why drown the flavours with heavy creams, heavy sauces and heavy oils? That's not good food and that's not preserving natural flavours.  KHAZANA is neither fusion cooking, nor the traditional Indian cuisine. Chef Sanjiv Kapoor should be on a mission to protect his culinary brand. Cheers Suresh Chawla  Toronto."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. So good that I hardly got through the appetizers. Didn't have enough room for the main meal. I ate with a group of colleagues. I'm now going to have to bring my wife to enjoy what I just did."}
{"text":"One of the top Indian restaurants (Recommended by an Indian friend). Famous Indian chef is the owner of this chain and the master chef of each restaurant was chosen after being appointed winner one of his top chefs competition shows.   The food is definitely reasonably priced for the atmosphere. I'm not a huge fan of Indian food but this place was good and each dish had a unique taste unlike other venues that serve Indian food. Their single malt Indian whiskey was also fantastic + they have specials on all their drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic on Thursday!  Want to go somewhere fancy for Indian food and not pay the hefty cost, this is your haven."}
{"text":"This restaurant is spacious so it's perfect for big group/family dinners. The ambience is nice. The food is good- but nothing to rave home about.  When we order curries, we always order family style(you gotta share the curries with the group- is there any other way?) but we order a mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. For my family of four we were ready to order 3 dishes and the waiter stopped us at two curries, stating that the quantity was huge. We still ordered three curries and I'm sure glad we did! The sizes were average, barely any for leftovers.    The naans were a tad overpriced. If I'm paying more than 4.00-4.50 for a special bread you're pushing it. The food was good.   It's a different atmosphere, it kind of reminds me of the style of fancier restaurants I've been to in India, but with mediocre food. It's a nice place to have a group dinner for a special occasion , they have a room that looked really nice!"}
{"text":"Different branches same item... yet so different! The first picture is from Sanjeev Kapoor's Khazana in Milton and the second one is from Sanjeev Kapoor's Khazana in Brampton. This surely represents that how careless the staff is in Brampton branch of Khazana! We reached the Restaurant at 9:15 pm because of Holika Dahan we got late and the manager said that they'll close the Restaurant by 10 pm but we can eat our meal upto 10:15 pm(which is good!!) and we have to place our order until 9:40 pm. We placed our order around 9:30 pm because by heart I know every items which I love but still we got our food at 10 pm. And yes we were strictly told that they will serve our starters and main course at the same time. So I felt like a cow or something that we have to eat all at once.  They were so desperate for closing the restaurant that they didn't had the courtesy to ask for a dessert (which we ordered while placing our order) before presenting the bill.  I'm a big fan of Sanjeev Kapoor and I've tried almost every restaurant and this one is the worst one! Didn't had such experience until now. Why you guys are doing this to Sanjeev Kapoor's Wonderchef and degrading his reputation.  I was so happy by my experience in Milton's Sanjeev Kapoor's Khazana but now I'm thinking to avoid such experience which we had in Brampton yesterday night and hence we'll not recommend this place to anyone!  The Mirch Pyaz roti was \"tight\" maybe they didn't make it fresh and served us the old one otherwise you eat and eat and eat because it's usually soft. Tikka Trio was cold without any presentation, in Shaam Savera the koftas seemed like they have been cooked in hurry because of the closing time.  We not be the great chefs but we do know the differences. Stop making fools and looting our money!  It's \"The Sanjeev Kapoor\"... the name is huge! So our expectations will be like that only. But the staff... they don't care at all!  And thanks for ruining my BIRTHDAY!!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE service/ quality of food. My family and I traveled all the way to Canada from buffalo to enjoy a nice dinner as my mom is a big fan of chef sanjeev kapoor. However, we were highly disappointed. From slow service to overrated price, it was not worth the hype at all. The server was just waiting to wrap up and rush us out as it was getting closer to closing time. That is not how you treat customers at a fine dining resturant. I would not recommend this resturant to anyone. It will be a waste of your time and money."}
{"text":"It's Sanjeev Kapoor's fusion like cuisine....it's a bit pricey but the special combo menus are filling and value to the tastebuds.  The black dal, veg platter, paneer dishes were tasty and enough for two persons for under $15.  It's open straight from morning to evening and that's why we ended up going.   The other places were closed for lunch by 3pm."}
{"text":"This is a fine dining Indian Style restaurant. Run by a top chef, everything is as you would expect from a fine dining experience, but a bit pricy.We were a bit intimidated by the menu, but our waiter Pritpal was fevers patient with us. We ordered some lamb appetizer and butter chicken, mixed vegetarian plate, and rice. I must say I enjoy everything. The spices, the taste, and the presentation was wonderful. Compliments to Chef Sanjeev Kapoor and his crew! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for a quick Friday lunch with the co-workers. The place looks great on the outside and inside. We got the rice, naan, and a few meat dishes. The food tasted on par with the rest of the Indian food around, maybe a little bit better. The food was seasoned very well. The service was great, nothing to complain on that point. The only point of complaining is the price. Their lunch prices are quite high. We shared two rice, a single naan, and two meat dishes, and the total cost came to almost 100$, that's before the drinks. It's quite pricey for lunch, for dinner, it would have been fine. The previous restaurant, had all you can eat lunch for 20$ which included tax and tip."}
{"text":"Having watched Sanjeev Kapoor and used his cook books I wanted to try this place for a while.  I live downtown so it took a bit of planning to get all the way to Brampton to try it.  I was surprised that the restaurant is located in a suburban mall/parking lot (while dining you see the neon lights of the RBC next door).  The restaurant is well decorated and does not smell like Indian food when you walk in - however we did notice papad crumbs under many of the tables.   The restaurant is trying very hard to be fine dining but it just misses the mark.  The staff is very friendly but could use some fine tuning.  We were a party of 2 and seated at a table set for 4 - no one removed the extra china on the table.  A glass bottle of water was placed on the table and it had grease and dried curry of some sort smeared on the side of the bottle.  We got the Shikanji to drink and it was delicious - however it came in very cheap looking barware with multi coloured bendy straws in them.    Our papad basket was refilled constantly and it came with 3 tasty dipping sauces.   We started with the Ajwan Prawns - by far our favorite dish, the prawns were perfectly cooked and it was a generous portion.    We got the \"lamb curry and shaam savera.  The lamb curry was describe as lamb shank but instead it was small cubes of lamb and no marrow bone in a tasty gravy.   The Shaam savera was tasty but the curry was too sweet.    Both dishes were presented well - however the copper serving dishes needed a good polish!   For dessert we got  the cardamom and condensed milk cream, which was very pretty - it looked like it was tumbling out of a matka.  However the matka wobbled when it was placed on the table and in trying to steady it, the waiter stuck his finger in the dessert!  The cream was garnished with crushed pistachios, strawberries and baby beet leaves ( Im hoping this should be flower petals and the kitchen had run out).    The cream itself was delicious but EXTREMELY rich - 2 big dessert eaters could barely make it through half the dessert.    I would go back and hope that Khazana irons out its kinks and becomes one of the GTA's few fine dining Indian restaurants"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this spot is next level for a Indian joint . Food is ok in taste but not extraordinary. Good for occasions  but a little pricey so be prepared to take a dent."}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambience. Amazing deserts. Always worth visiting - never fails to live upto fine-dining standards."}
{"text":"Low on quantity, high on price but the food was delicious. Butter chicken was little sweet, good for kids, Mutton was great along with tandoori murg."}
{"text":"Arrived at the restaurant and had to wait for approximately 10 minutes for them to get a table ready even though the restaurant was half empty. Once they did find me a table they did not get me the menu and I had to ask two different waiters to get it for me. They got it after 5 minutes and only got one when there were 7 adults at the table. I had to ask the waiter to take my order. The food arrived after 20 minutes and it was really good. The butter chicken was amazing. I had ordered Biryani and they completely forgot to serve it. We had finished the food and decided to not tell them about the missing Biryani and even though the food was good the service was horrible. They forgot a dish and when asked to pack the food I had to remind them again to bring the packed food so I could leave."}
{"text":"I actually found out about this restaurant while I was on uber one day. I asked the driver which one is his favourite Indian cuisine. And he told me about this restaurant.  Reshmi seekh chicken kebab. It's hallow and very flavourful.   The butter chicken, I find it a little too sweet. Wasn't a huge fan of it.  Magalorian Fish coconut, it is quite spicy, but very flavourful. It goes well with the basmati rice.   Service was great and very attentive.  After dinner, you get a hot towel to wipe your hand. Will come back when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here. The food was flavorful and well presented. Our server Arun was polite and patient. We enjoyed everything from the tandoori platter to kulfi and pan. I like the names of the dishes in the menu. I appreciate the staff for doing justice with Sanjeev Kapoor's name."}
{"text":"After a lot of anticipation and word of mouth I decided to dine in. This restaurant is owned by one of the most celebrated chefs from India. The building looks pretty nice from outside. As soon as I entered, I was seated. Great 1st impression of the customer service, and ambience of the inside of the restaurant. Very elegantly decorated, and it seems a thorough thought process was placed on the seating, comfortable furniture and overall look. I honestly wished the food matched the anticipation. Pretty average in taste, even though the presentation with which each dish was presented was nice, the taste compartment left me with a lot to be desired. Nothing special:( Overall a good place to get together, mediocre food ( can't believe I have to write that). I went in with a lot of expectations, sadly I didn't feel the food did justice to the brand name brought by Sanjiv kapoor\"s Khazana."}
{"text":"For a top chef this was horrible food. If this was by a no name brand in Kansas I would give it a 3 star."}
{"text":"Ok so Sanjeev kapoor is to India, what Bobby flay is to America, he is a quintessential celebrity chef, first one in India at that. He has a long running television series called khana khazana, hence the name.   I've been there 3-4 times, I must say this is one of the classier looking Indian restaurants you will ever visit. But sadly I've been there with my parents and uncle all this time and they are all strictly vegetarian.   So I wasn't able to order anything meat, but I read the menu and I want to go back now and try their non veg items.   In my visits I've tried, dal makhani (lentils cooked in cream tomato sauce and butter with ginger garlic. ) This was the best dal I've ever had, amazing.   Palak paneer( spinach and Indian cottage cheese) Shyam savera( which literally means evening-morning) this dish has a rich creamy tomato sauce. But the start is the kofta( balls, made of spinach as outer layer and paneer as inner ball or layer, so when you cut it is green outside and white inside).  I've also tried their delectable breads, the service was good, they are extremely busy so calling ahead is not a bad idea."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience while eating at the restaurant. Greeted by a friendly hostess. Was seated promptly, food and drink came out fast. The atmosphere went above and beyond for a fine dining restaurant. Great quality of food, best of all, didn't leave a big hole in my wallet. This is more of an experience that has to be lived and cannot be explained online. Definitely do recommend it and will be going back with my girlfriend so she can share the experience too."}
{"text":"We traveled an hour to get to the restaurant on a regular Sunday, at 12:45 in the afternoon, after checking their website at home, only to be told that the restaurant was closed all day today for a private function.  There was no information to indicate this otherwise, they don't ask you to call ahead and check first, so there really is no way to know that this could also happen.  We are big fans of the food, but such unprofessional behaviour is very disheartening and disappointing.  Will rethink going back again.  There are plenty of really good Indian restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"Let me start off positively. The restaurant is gorgeous. And the staff were polite, except our server who was cold and only came to us once. We had to call on him to pack our left overs.  The Lawrence road chicken as the starter had a lovely spice but was incredibly over cooked. The breast was almost chalky it was so well done. The pickles and chutneys were flavourful and large in portion. The chicken korma and aloo gobi came shortly after the appetizer. We told our server at the start that I had a severe gluten allergy. The byriani came with bread baked on top of it. The Korma was super rich that you could only eat a spoon if it. And the aloo gobi was standard. The bill for two people was over $100 and that's with water to drink.  Overall it was a nice place but when it comes to dealing with people who have allergies, they are not capable of understanding the importance of the situation.  I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"It's tough for me to rate Khazana. The place itself is upscale, with modern decor and white tablecloths. It's also owned by Indian celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor. Based on those two factors alone, you know you're going to be paying a premium.  One thing that's undeniable is that the food here is good. I've been here 5 times now and I've never had a dish I didn't like. Having said that, it's difficult for me to justify coming here more often because there's just so many other more affordable alternatives for Indian food in Brampton. The food gets pricey and is definitely targeted more toward special occasions.  The menu itself is a little complicated to the casual diner as many dish names are in Hindi. For example, you won't find butter chicken on the menu, but rather, you'll find murgh makhani. Because of this, it took us longer to order because we were reading through every single description to find the dishes we wanted.  One thing that I'd say is a must-order is the garlic naan. It's by far the best garlic naan I've ever had. It's super garlicky and super buttery and is consistent with every bite. The only catch? It's $5 per order. The meat dishes weren't outstanding here, but I did like nalli rogan josh (lamb) a lot. The chicken biryani is also a great option as it comes with a decent amount of chicken and is served piping hot, and covered with fresh bread. You'll find that main dishes will run $15-20+, and that your naan will be about $5.   The food here is a solid 4.5 stars. For the price, though? I'd have to dock it down to at least a 4. At $30+ after tax and tips, there are many other places I'd rather dine.   The service here is spotty... It does take quite a while to fulfill requests, especially when requesting the bill. You really have to plan ahead with your requests when you're working with time constraints, such as an hour lunch break. Also, one time I visited, the waiter was very pushy and constantly trying to upsell us in terms of our orders. Once we stood firm with our order, he no longer came back to check on us for the rest our meal. Coincidence? I think not...  The thing that initially drew me to Khazana in the first place was their summer lunch deal. While the restaurant is otherwise quite expensive, the lunch deal they had through nearly the end of last year was amazing. For $10, the deal included 1 veg/1 meat curry, garlic naan, and basmati rice. For $15, you could add another meat curry. It was a lot of food for the price, and at half or less than half of what you'd pay for a normal experience. Unfortunately, it seems they've gotten rid of this deal now.  Overall Khazana is a restaurant embodied by great food at above average prices, which make it less justifiable in a city abundant with options for Indian food. The ambiance is great, however, making it a good option for occasions. The service is spotty, but this can be overcome if you plan ahead. Lastly, look out for them if they ever get another lunch special, because the previous one was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Half the menu has changed and they are changing more in July or so.. I hope its better.. right now its ok... n the service is little slow.."}
{"text":"We brought my BF's mom and his family here for her birthday celebration.  The food was very very good, no complaints there.  We ordered a bunch of different items to share - my faves dishes were the veggie tandoor platter, the pistachio naan (so so good!!) and the chili coconut fish curry.  Downside : Our waiter however seemed possibly inebriated, and even more so as the night wore on. We ended up waiting 15 awkward minutes to pay the bill as he wandered away while we were trying to use the debit machine and it stopped working.  Not a great way to end what was mostly a fun night.  Pro tip : try the sanf (spelling?) on the way out!"}
{"text":"I've never heard of Chef Sanjeev Kapoor before, but since he's apparently some hotshot chef from India, I was excited to try this place out.  I had the chicken biryani and stole some butter chicken/roti from my friends who were dining alongside me. None of us were big fans of spicy food, and the restaurant really toned down on the spices at our request. Big points for that. The chicken was amazingly tender and flavourful, as was the butter chicken.  Now that I know this place is quality, I'll be sure to be a little more experimental with my menu picks next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We enjoy Indian food. We frequent a number of strip mall restaurants. Artisan cooking is fun to eat. Then last week we had lunch at Khazana. No more strip malls. There is a difference between cooks and chefs. We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered. I am no pretentious foodie, I love good food and expect value (quality not quantity). The spicing was layered and fantastic. The food was prepared well and came to the table hot. There were chunks of chicken that were juicy. The naan was plentiful and very well made (another pet peeve of mine at some places). Initially the server started off a little stand-offish, but became really pleasant and attentive once the food arrived and we started eating. It's a bit of a drive from home, but we will be back to work our way methodically through the menu."}
{"text":"i picked up tandoori chicken take out, was undercooked and gave me food poisoning. I missed two days of work and had a horrible experience. What kind of place cant even cook chicken?? this place is a joke."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a ZERO star rating- I would! The service was slower than slow, very unorganized, curry dishes are served before the naan and the jeera rice has a pungent spoiled smell at a ridiculous price of $12.00!!  My family of 5 went to this restaurant all the way from Thornhill for my mother in laws birthday. We were seated at a table that was catching a draft from the front door so we kindly requested a booth that was already open- the server said she would set it up and have it ready in 5 minutes. Twenty (20) minutes later the table was still not set up and we were left there freezing and staring at the empty table still. They got the point eventually and got help to set it up and let us know it was ready. We sat and waited an additional 10 minutes to order drinks and another 15 minutes to order appetizers. So 45 minutes in and we still haven't eaten. We ordered the mushroom caps and some sort of tandoori chicken- both were decent however the mushrooms seemed a bit under cooked. When we finished the apps, the waitress then realized she didn't take our dinner order.... 1 hour in now. We ordered garlic and buttered naan, which clearly came about 8 minutes after the three meat and one veggie dish came out....the three meat dishes were disgusting!! One tasted like water and Unmarinated chicken pieces, the butter chicken tasted nothing like butter chicken and the other chicken dish the waitress recommended tasted like a blend of the other two dishes- all the same colour, similar tastes and each dish contained about five large pieces of chicken, THATS IT!! About 14.99 each dish!!! I didn't taste the veggie dish. The naan were the only thing good: fluffy soft and buttery! Now let's talk about the rice.... I wanted rice to eat my curries with and asked if they had basmati rice, the waitress replied no and explained it was plain white rice (whatever that means) and she suggested the jeera rice. We all agreed at the table that the jeera rice might make things more tasty and we will all share some as it was recommended.... Little did we know that we just ordered a dish of rice mixed with an abundance of cumin seeds and other spices, tinted yellow with haldi (turmeric) and a strong odour of something spoiled!! This thing smelled horrid!! We couldn't believe they served it to us! When we brought it up with the waitress, she returned from the kitchen saying that she is unsure of the reason but the kitchen staff said its the spices they use to cook it... Something with onions.... It smelled more like onions had spoiled... The waitress even agreed with us that the rice had an unpleasant stench!! She even further agreed that the food itself was horrible! All for the price of 12.99!!! We barely eat out dishes and were turned off completely by the food. We requested for the bill and could not believe how horrendously overpriced the dishes were!! They even charged us for the rotten rice!! We asked to speak with a manager and the waitress said unfortunately he was gone for the evening.... What?! We were so furious about this experience that we agreed a Yelp review was necessary- maybe it would save a few ppl from a horrible evening.  P.s the experience may have been lightened up had they acknowledged it was my mother in laws birthday... We only hinted them three times...."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the food for the first time and decided to do takeout. The prices are reasonable but wish they filled up the container all the way instead of 3/4 full. The curries were good but very mild. They should have added some more spices to them."}
{"text":"Sanjeev Kapoor is a legend in India and it's the name that will draw foodies to this place. It's a franchise  and is the first in North America. The first question you ask is \"Is the food really different from all other restaurants here in Toronto?\" And the answer is a resounding YES. The food here is pretty awesome - I tried out both veggie and non veg stuff.  mushroom, Baigan or even the Biryani. I love the style with which they serve food here. The food leaves you wanting for more. The ambience is super - you will love it. The staff makes you feel comfortable and take care of all the small details. It's one of the most stylish Indian restaurants out here. Try it out for business lunch/dinner or special occasions. It's a pricey restaurant and I'd reserve this one for special occasions."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best Indian food, then you have found your place. We ordered around 9 different dishes and each one was so unique and delicious we couldn't pick a favourite. Make sure to try both the non veg and vegetarian dishes. The paneer tikka masala was my favorite. Even the masala chai and the dessert platter are just as good as the main courses. The ambience is great. My only issues were that we came during a wedding party and the service wasn't up to par and the guests kept on interrupting our private area. I'm giving it a 3.5 but would come again and up the score perhaps when it isn't busy."}
{"text":"I usually don't give 1-star rating but I'm afraid I will have to on this occasion.   I actually didn't even get a chance to order food here - that's how bad the service was. Upon entering, there was a small crowd of guests. I couldn't find anyone responsible for taking orders and reservations. Eventually found a waiter and asked him \"hey do you know how long the wait is?\"  I was rudely told \"I don't know. Wait here and talk to someone else\". I waited for another 10 minutes and then decided to go somewhere else. What the heck? I get better service at a McDonald's. Don't bother coming here. It's just another fancy looking Indian restaurant that lacks basic manners (I say this as an Indian)."}
{"text":"Made a reservations to have dinner here tonight. I was seated promptly and began to admire the beautiful interior - very modern. When my family arrived, we order several dishes from their menu and hoped for a delicious meal. We started off with their prawns and chicken from their tandoor. Their prawns were delicious however I wished they gave more than 6 pieces. Their dishes are pricier ($15-30) and are smaller (feeds 2-3 people per curry which is what the waiter suggested) than what you would receive from a traditional Indian restaurant. After our appetizers, we then had to wait 30 minutes for our mains. We noticed that the tables around us who were seated after, were receiving food before us. When we asked a sever to check on our mains, he said \" the other table is just receiving their appetizer and that mains take more time.\"  I then asked him to check anyways and he said he would. About ten minutes after our conversation, the rest of our meal arrived. I found their butter chicken flavorful, their dal wasn't anything special and their meat biriyani was very spicy. Their vegetarian biriyani was more mild. Overall, I agree with other Yelpers. For a fine dining establishment, their service could be improved to match the beautiful ambiance they provide."}
{"text":"A nice place for a fine dining.... though our expectations were much higher about this restaurant. The foods are ok, as expected from a master chef like him. But comparing quality-quantity-price, I would give it 3 star. Do keep in mind about the quantity, it's much smaller than other restaurants. You need to order about 1.5x more than what you usually order in other restaurants. Overall, the ambiance is good, a decent place, but it's bit pricey."}
{"text":"I love food. I travel for food. I am here from USA.  This place looks upscale. I ordered chicken and veg for entire family. We were super hungry so eating anything can taste good. However, my senses were pretty open to taste of this so called yummy food. Just disappointed chicken taste. It has some heavy flavor to it. Gravy was not good at all. Sourrrrrr.    Now for veg. I had ordered malai Kofta. Well, they had put in cheese balls and once again sour grevy. Not the same malai kofta you would be used to.  Papadam was not in stock and couple other items were out of stock. Wow. Really.....    No white rice is served with your order like normal restaurant. I get it that it's unique restaurant. However being Indian you would expect that to part of your true indian meal.   I would give 4 star to their biryani as it was pretty tasty.   Decore is nice and some musician singing Indian gazals and bollywood songs made the night little better."}
{"text":"EDITED: I've left the original below. I was asked to come though for lunch by the manager to make up for my previous experience as was reviewed here earlier. That was a nice gesture. For lunch I had the Chicken Kebab for appetizers, Chicken Biryani. Lamb in a Yogurt Gravy, Dal Makhani (Lentils in a cream base),, Garlic Naan. Starting from the beginning, the Chicken Kebab's had one flavour profile (just masala no others) some dry considerably some quite nice. We thought it was chicken breast (tasted, looked like it, confirmed with the manager there, but when we brought this to the attention later on to the gentleman he said it was chicken thighs. That's a conundrum). The dal was just butter with some lentils thrown in. The lamb technically for $20 was relatively nice, about 8 1\" cubes of Lamb in a gravy which didn't remind me of the dish it was supposed to be, but was quite soft and nice. The quantity was extremely minimal though. The Chicken Biryani (again the conundrum or the breast vs the thighs), the rice itself didn't have flavour but the chicken / gravy near the end was quite nice. All in all a better experience when compared to the last two times. But sadly still not memorable. Which is what I really hoped for.    PREVIEW REVIEW: Second time heading to Khazana. Possibly last. The first time was 1/2 decent I think (or I hope, it was a while back and considering I don't recall usually means it wasn't exciting).   Pros. Beautiful ambiance. Giving a high end feel. Great service. Price is apt for the high end Indian restaurant that it's meant to be. No issues with that.   The food though is a quite a disappointment. I got myself an assortment of items from their menu. The lunch special with Adraki Dhania Paneer (Ginger, Coriander Cottage Cheese), Butter Chicken, Goat Curry (Nalli Rogan Josh), a platter of Mangalorian Fish Curry, Keema with peas and to drink a Jaljeera (soda, spices supposed to be refreshing). The server quickly left some roast papadams at the table which I realized that they were raw in the middle and over done on the sides. The drink was the saddest excuse for a Jaljeera. No taste.   The Cottage Cheese and the Mangalorian Fish Curry has the same gravy. Like literally. The servers admitted it. There were no South Indian spices as one would expect from a South Indian Dish. The butter chicken was super sweet gravy with over cooked chicken. They told me that butter chicken is supposed to be sweet. Really? When made incorrectly it's sweet. All of the gravy dishes had too much cream, low to no salt and were sweet. The goat was tough and overly salted. The awesome server did try to make it right by giving us a new Fish curry to take home. But besides adding spices it was the same. The ground meat with peas was nice. Pointless and nothing ground breaking or exciting for Sanjeev Kapoor but yea. The Roti's given were hard :( this Is sad. The Naan was nice though.   All together The service and ambiance are the only saving grace. (Hence the 2*) Not enough to keep discerning customers though. For an establishment that would like to present itself as high end Indian Cuisine it falls considerably short."}
{"text":"This place is an absolutely first class experience! And when I say that, I truly mean it. It's akin to flying First Class on a commercial airliners. The service is absolutely superb, the dishes are absolutely delectable, and immaculately presented. Your server is with you through the entire experience of the meal, and never misses a beat. The have an awesome selection of wines and other alcohols, should that be to your appetite for the night. The decor is absolutely amazing as well; the entire place exudes a type of Buddha-bar-mixed-with ultra-high-end-lounge-type ambiance. This restaurant is less of a restaurant and more of an experience. Which brings us to the next point, how much exactly is this experience going to cost?   Should you wish to titillate your palette, the 5-course dinner option is best for you; this experience will cost about $50-$60/person excluding the alcohol. Otherwise you can order from the à la carte meal which will cost about $30-$40.   In summary, this is an excellent experience that transcends the sole pleasures of the palette, and reaches a level where all your senses are catered to. Should you only be able to visit this place once, I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, clean place, excellent food! Service is slow but other than that a great place to try out for Indian food."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my friends. The ambience was nice. The staff was courteous. We were 6 of us and had ordered 2 appetizers which were good. I don't remember their names but one was like a paneer roll and the other was a mixed platter. Later we ordered malai kofta and paneer chilli with naans in entree. The taste of malai kofta was good. But I dint like the presentation. It is a big giant kofta with gravy. The paneer in paneer chilli was very hard. Lastly we had ordered yellow dal with jeera rice which was fab. I would definitely try out other dishes too here."}
{"text":"Sanjeev kapoor.. the name is huge.. and that raises your expectations to a certain level, coz you have grown up watching his recipes. And, then there is a restuarant by that name. We traveled 2 hours to get here. That's ok, if it's worth it..Let me break this down... Pros: Ambiance is beautiful. Highly sophisticated. It will give you a feel of a high end restuarant. Price is fine. It's the way it should be. The food and service is quite a disappointment. We went there to celebrate my brother's birthday.  We started by ordering tomato soup. For $6, they gave me warmed up butter chicken gravy.. I mean is this some kind of a joke? It was just warmed up sauce. Then, we got \"Aam ki khatti meethi seekh\". I would highly recommend this appetizer. I have tried their other appetizers, and this one was unique and I liked it the best! However, that didn't last long.. For the mains, we got Paneer Tikka Masala and Mushroom Hara Pyaza.  Jeez, the size of bell peppers in paneer tikka masala was huge. You would put those size of peppers in tandoori paneer tikka, not in a gravy dish. It was really huge. And to top that the paneer pieces were really really hard.  Mushroom hara pyaza.. it was just green peas all over the place. And it was too creamy. Too creamy!!! It had no taste at all.  We hardly ate anything.. The naan and lachha paratha was nice though. It is quite sad. You would expect a descent food with the name attached to the restuarant. Food was very bland. But it's very disappointing.  Also, the wait time between appetizer and main course was around 15-20 minutes. There should be a subtle flow.  Slow service! Over rated! Bland food!"}
{"text":"Ordered small party combo for take out only cause it was the one place I found while I was quickly searching that would offer such a deal for my large crew visiting from out of town. Had very low expectations since I basically picked the first place I found, but was pleasantly surprised by the amount of food that we got and the quality. The combo came with 6 dishes, 10 naan, rice and dessert for $75 and that was plenty to comfortably feed 8 adults with leftovers. Food is North Indian, so not on the spicy side, but very tasty! If I ever come back to the area again I will strongly consider paying this place another visit.  Also props to the staff who were handling orders coming via phone and counter, and packing up food  like pros during the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Food was great! Excellent menu and great customer service focus! Aaron our waiter gave us excellent suggestions and options based on tastes for the day. Will definitely be back to try different parts of the menu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I'm tempted to go so far as to call it the best Indian cuisine in GTA.  Customer service is exceptional. It does feel like a fine dining experience as advertised or rather expected.  Food is constantly delicious. We've been here over 6 times in past couple of months and never left with a bad after taste.  Appetizers: Aloo Nazakat is my 'must have'. Being avid potato lover, this sumptuous dish with spinach filling sets the course. Pudina seekh kebabs are a relish. Soft, tender and juicy to send shockwaves all over your palate.  Main course: Puran Singh da Murgh (chicken) & Gosht Marchwangan Korma (Mutton/Goat). Every.Single.Time.   My friends & everyone I know love their Lalla Mussa Dal but for some reason I find it odd. But oh well!  Don't forget to pair above with the Pyaaz Mirch ki Roti (Bread made together with onions & green chillies).  And, the Paan Kulfi to finish the guilt trip!"}
{"text":"Appetizers are the best, the main course is good, ambiance and service is great, and the price is a bit on the high side. Some of the recipes are unique which you will not find anywhere else which is great.   They currently have a special price for lunch from Mon-Fri till 5pm that is for $20 you can have 3 dishes, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert and 2 garlic or butter nan bread. Definitely worth trying!!   I would go back here again."}
{"text":"Disappointing considering all the hype.  Ambiance is nice, however the food combined with the exorbitant pricing is a let down."}
{"text":"The most glaring issue with this restaurant is that it has no real identity as either an authentic Indian restaurant or one pandering to non-Indian palettes.  It has weird fusion-like cuisine that would likely please a small proportion of people.  For example, masala papad is never roasted, always fried, and even a novice would not serve it without cilantro.  It was spicy with no flavour.  There is no curry lamb or any form of goat on the menu.  Seriously?  Salmon with wasabi is not an Indian dish, though it was one of the better tasting items.  Neither are most of the other ridiculous sounding dishes like pani puri filled with pineapple and cranberry juice?  Again, what are you smoking?  One should be different only insofar as one improves upon taste, not makes it worse or go rogue just to be different!  The service was excruciatingly slow whereas the place was sparsely occupied at the 2:45 PM-5:45 PM we were there, yet I tipped a generous 18% plus change to arrive at a round number of $200 for 3 people.  That is a ridiculous amount of money for less than ordinary food.  I am terribly disappointed not so much by the food because I expect very little from high profile places in terms of taste and authenticity, as I am by disrespect for the customer, whether it be by way of the unshakeable feeling I get that they think the customer does not know better, or that they expect people would patronize them despite their offering, for those portions and at gouging prices.  I may not have the tandoor or be able to cook the variety, but I can certainly cook better!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food was amazing, that's what people really want to see first. I ordered Non-Veg Delight (Bhati ka Murgh Boti Kebab, Pakhtooni Burra, Tandoori Wasabi Salmon Tikka, Tandoori Aloo Nazakat) which was a treat. The chicken melted in my mouth, probably the best i have had other then having it in india. My only downside to this place was the service but again i would take great food over great service any day of the week."}
{"text":"We drove from Toronto to checkout the food here. It was completely empty in the afternoon but the service was great and the food was really good! Especially the 24K Dal."}
{"text":"First. Time trying it , good food and ambience , service was good . Bathrooms could be better maintained ."}
{"text":"A little disappointed, as many of the items on the menu were NOT available. Ended up ordering mostly appetizers, service was OK. The food tasted good. I noticed many of the menu items listed were actually things that were prepared by contestants on the Indian version of the show 'Master Chef', such as the pani puri, etc. Tried the lamb chops which was good.  I guess they are relying a bit too much on the name to carry this place, but maybe it will improve over time to merit being top class."}
