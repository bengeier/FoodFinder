{"text":"I work near this Showmars and I've been eating at Showmars in general for decades. This one is usually on the solid side. Order correct, food hot, no mess or fuss. So, the service may have contributed to my want to post a review a lil bit. I'm one of those guys who eats a little bit of everything that's non-meat. Read: I eat vegan and vegetarian ish a lot and I enjoy it, but I ain't necessarily vegan or vegetarian....ya dig? Annnnnnnd, I travel a bit...internationally. So, I've tried a good bit of that vegan and vegetarian (non-meat) ish. 

Let me give it to you straight, this black-bean and sweet potato veggie burger I ate there today (not a mish-mash, soy based, bland flavored buster of a veggie burger).....yes sir. Thank you....carry on."}
{"text":"Portions are getting smaller and smaller for the prices. Watched a manager remove a small piece of fish from a customers plate, stating to the cook, that it was too many.  How inappropiate to do such a thing, and especially in the eyeshot of customers. More than likely, I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This Showmars is near my work and I eat here often. As with all the other locations in the Charlotte NC area, Showmars delivers both great seafood and burgers at a affordable price. They also have a selection of salads and chicken items, however I usually come for the flounder and shrimp combo. I definitely recommend this place, however if you don't like the mall setting, you should checkout one of their other locations."}
{"text":"Mall food is pretty formulaic; :enter name here: Chinese, :enter name here: Japanese, :enter name here: Cheesesteak.  And then there's this gem: Showmars!
Consistant quality brings me back once  a week.  The cashiers are always pleasant, and the food is hot and fresh.  
One of my favorites is the Gyro, smothered in Showmar's signature Pita Sauce (an interesting take on the traditional tzatziki!)  Try it with feta, and you won't be disappointed.
Each day, Showmars offers a different special.  My favorite day is Big Salad Thursdays for the win!!
Good food, great service, decent prices; a great change of pace from ordinary mall foods!
Noosh!

Decided to grab a quick bite to eat while the rest of the family went shopping, so I popped over to the food court to see what I could find.  Among the national food chains, such as Chick Fil-A, The Great Steak & Potato Co., Sbarro, Orange Julius, and Subway, I spotted Showmars and recalled reading a few good reviews on it, so I made a beeline and checked out the menu, which proved to be quite extensive: gyros, souvlakis, burgers, pita burgers, seafood platters, including fried flounder, hot dogs, and even baklava by the silce ($1.99, fyi)!  Service seemed very friendly and eager to help.  

After a few minutes and a few questions, I decided to go w/ an Old-fashion Jr. pita burger (chili, cheese, coleslaw, onions, and mustard), hold the mustard, and a side of fries, for a grand total of $6.  (FYI, Jr. burgers feature one patty, regular has two.)  Combo plates were available, but I didn't want anything from the soda fountain.  Paid for the meal and was given a receipt and a buzzer.  Thought I'd check out the buffet spread at Maki of Japan (right across from Showmars) in the meantime, but I hadn't even crossed the path of chairs and tables to get to the other side of the room when my buzzer started to vibrate-- that was fast!  

My platter looked very nice, but I lamented that my pita burger lacked surface veggies, not even lettuce (!), and the manager told me that only the original burgers had lettuce and tomato.  However, he offered to add lettuce for me- very nice!  I enjoyed the chili-burger-coleslaw combo; however, I did find the whole sandwich a bit sweeter than I'd prefer-- most likely from the sugar in the coleslaw.  Also, I would've eaten more of the pita had it been crisped/toasted.  No matter, as eating less of the pita allowed me to enjoy more of the crinkle-cut fries- the best part of the entire meal!  Those who like saltier fries may want to grab a salt packet or two, as my fries were a bit under-salted, even for my taste.

Was happy to find something local in this mall's food court, and I wouldn't mind coming back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. I think calling it Greek food is a stretch. Maybe Greek inspired. My experience wasn't bad. But it wasn't great and it wasn't the Greek fix I was searching for."}
