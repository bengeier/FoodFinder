{"text":"We visited at around 3 PM on Wednesday, and what a disappointment. After my friend's good recommendation of other locations, Brookfield and First Canadian, I was excited to try, but the service was horrible, salad area was dirty, not sure if the server reuse dirty gloves after taking payment from customers.
I ordered First Canadian bowl, but they don't have quinoa, the very first ingredient listed for this bowl was not available! Unbelievable! Cooking quinoa is not very complicated and very basic; it showed laziness of the staff to cook more, and care about what they were selling to the customers. So I asked what are the substitutes, he said kale or brown rice, none of them peaked my interest. I was exited for quinoa, so I asked what about tofu, he said it will be extra. I was very disappointed, no accommodation what so ever. Then he moved to the salad containers buffet area, and ewww....! Can't the staff spend a few minutes to clean up this area, it looked very dirty.  Mixed up salads In between containers, very messy and dirty, very unappetizing! I could understand if it's a busy lunch hour, but at this time, there was barely any customer. Staff should be able to clean up and tidy up the area for hygienic and presentation purposes. With the cost, I felt this was inappropriate. In chipotle for example,  they always clean up the salad bar area. It didn't take a lot of time to do this! There were about 3 people working behind the counter, but they looked very disorganized. 1 person, he took the order, made the salad, handed to the customer, took payment, no smile, non- accommodating, unprofessional. My friend ordered in front of me, she complained her box is nearly empty, but instead of adding to make her happy, he argued that her portion was perfect. After took her payment he took my order, made it, etc, all this time, the line has started to form, but 1 staff, she stayed in the back the whole time, immersed in whatever unimportant tasks, 1 person, she was busy playing with some displays. I didn't think it was more important than taking care of customer. Overall this branch is very disorganized, messy, non - accommodating, bad customer service, snobish staff, slow, non - hygienic, and disappointment. I didn't feel it was worth of my money with the level of service I received, food quantity and presentation. I didn't expect something extra ordinary, it's a fast food in a food court setting, but I'm sure they can improve to give a proper service and cleanliness, they are basics. I hope management can re-train staff in the area of customer service, food presentation, and hygiene. 2 points I gave is for the freshness of the salad and taste."}
{"text":"This location is not great, it was much better when it opened but has been downhill since. I have found that the portions can vary greatly depending on who is dishing it out and very often I have gotten very hard/crunchy rice (not what i am looking for). I love the food and particularly the Almond Lime but with these issues it just is not worth 12 bucks. Fix up these things and I would definitely make it a regular staple of mine as I literally work in the same Metro Hall building."}
{"text":"This is the worst Kupfert & Kim location so I'm impatiently waiting for the new Spadina location to open so that I don't have to walk to Metro Hall for half empty $11 salad boxes and non-existent steel cut oats (guess the employees weren't getting along that day--somebody decided to play hide and seek with the ingredients). I miss the First Canadian Place location and even have to walk all the way to Brookfield sometimes."}
{"text":"I had the \"almond lime bowl\" and it was yummy. It was a light lunch though, normally I cannot finish these type of bowls but I was able to in this one, which says the quantity wasn't to much. It sells over 10 dollar plus tax which I think is pricey.. It is healthy and delicious for sure."}
