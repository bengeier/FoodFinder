{"text":"Pizza on my side of Pittsburgh in general is not that good especially in my delivery radius. I think many would agree the North hills in general just isn't great for foodies. I've lived in NYC, Buffalo, Caribbean, Columbus, and yes even NC had better pizza. But lupis famous is good pizza and the buffalo chicken pizza is excellent. My guests really enjoyed it and they are pizza snobs from buffalo. I have tried getting pizzas from different places in my delivery area and this is the first time they complimented the pizza.  Thank you it made me happy to finally for once impress my friends."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza Fresh ingredients  Friendly service Reasonable prices  Fast hot delivery Close to my house.   I love Lupi's if you live in the area this is the best pizza and hoagie place around  I recommend the steak ranchero hoagie and any pizza they offer. The wings are great too"}
{"text":"I moved to the Pittsburgh area about a year ago, and have been a customer of Lupi's for most of that year. Most of my orders had been great! Food was good, driver was always kind, etc. Then I had an order this evening that absolutely turned me from their establishment. I had called in and ordered around $50.00 worth of food for myself and some friend that were over. They took my order and all my information down to my payment, but never once asked for my name, which I thought was a little odd. We put in a movie and had figured the food would arrive about 30-45 minutes in. An hour into the movie we realized the food had not arrived yet. I called to check on the order and they said it was out for delivery. It arrived fifteen minutes later. I live less than 4 miles from the establishment, so the fact that the food took an hour and fifteen minutes to make and arrive was a little frustrating to me, but wasn't that big of a deal. I received the food, tipped the driver (Who was very kind to me), and went inside. When I began unpacking my order to serve my friend, I realized there was a mistake with half the food I ordered. I called back to try and resolve the mistake. A person answered and I explained that some of my food was not made the way I ordered it. I heard lupi's employee say to \"Hold on,\" and then I heard a conversation in the background while I was \"Holding.\" I heard the person who answered the phone speaking to someone else, \"this person is saying their order is wrong.\" The other person responded, \"Did you enter it wrong?\" The original answerer to the other person \"I don't think so, possibly, I don't know.\" \"See what he wants to do.\" The original person came on the line again and spoke blankly, \"What do you want to do about this?\" I explained that we would like our order corrected to what I originally ordered. The person then said, \"What like exchange the food back?\" I then said, \"do you want the food that was made incorrectly?\" The lupi's employee said yes he wanted the food back, so I agreed to \"exchange\" the food and they would send out the correct order. We decided to nibble on the food that was correct, and kept the food for the lupi's employee that was incorrect. An hour and thirty minutes went by, and I called a little more irritated at this point, but remained a calm stern voice asking to speak to a manager. The man who was on the phone was a manager, I calmly explained my frustrations and asked where my order was. He rudely and frustratingly stated to me that they were, \"Busy and it took time to make the food.\" I told him I understood that, but I had called two hours and forty-five minutes prior asking for an order and still haven't received my proper order. Then the next thing he stated to me completely threw me off guard, \"Look, we are busy. We are getting phone calls with other orders in. I cannot spend time on the phone with you. I need to go make other orders.\" I was completely taken aback by this. They do not care at all about their customers. I was not rude to them despite my frustrations. They came about 20 minutes after my last call with the rest of my order. I asked if they wanted their incorrectly made food and they told me no. I was completely disappointed in my transaction this evening [6/29/2018], and the way I was treated. I will not be ordering from them for a very long time. I hope no one else has to go through a similar ordeal I went through."}
{"text":"Great pizza, but the winnngs!! Some of the best wings I have ever had before. Always the go-to for wings. Introduced pasta dishes about a year ago, a lot better than you would expect. Taste/texture of a restaurant/home cooking, not the usual pizza shop pasta dish. Friendly service always given. Try it out!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eaten here, but a discussion thread about great sandwiches (http://www.yelp.com/topic/pittsburgh-the-best-sandwich-in-the-universe) sparked my recollection.    The pizza is not fantastic.  I've had it on several occasions.  It's decent, but nothing to write home about, but the Omnivore. . . that IS something to write home about, and the letter would read something like this:  Dear Mom,  I just had the most amazing sandwich of my life.  It had bacon and hot peppers, eggs and onion rings, cappicola and steak, cheese. . . and and. . . more stuff!  I ate the whole thing because it was too yummy to stop.  I am now in intensive care after going into cardiac arrest from eating the damn thing, but it was WORTH it.  If you and Dad decide to get one, you should split it, but if you don't, leave the house to me, my sister will just trash it.  Love, Jim  Something like that.  Bottom line, you can buy one of these sandwiches and cut it into quarters and feed four people.  Can't recommend the pizza (it's fair. . .) but definitely try the sandwiches.  Take out only. . . there's a table or two there, but mostly just for people to wait in the AC-less Mercury-like atmosphere while they finish your food.  Oh, I almost forgot. . . the wings are good too."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good. The best thing to order is the breadsticks. So tasty. Service and delivery are always really good as"}
