{"text":"They do one thing and they do it well.  Instead of waiting for a street festival, you can get lamb kabobs here.  7 sticks for $10  Very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is great at what they're known for, which is lamb skewers freshly grilled to order at any spice level you desire. Order and pay first (cash only) and wait somewhere close but not too close - it gets quite smoky near the grill - for your skewers to be made.   Sadly prices have gone up recently from 3/$5 and 7/$10 to 3/$6.5 and 7/$12 so docking a star but I'll Still be dropping by each time I'm at p-mall from the nostalgia of street vendors back home."}
{"text":"Was at Pmall today, and I was craving skewers (oddly enough)!  My first time here and the menu is very simple. 3 skewers for $6.50 or 7 for $12. They offer lamb, chicken or beef. They also had a speciality section where you can choose lamb ribs, liver and heart or something like that but that was too complex for me hahaha.  Sharing with the boyfr, we decided to go for 7 skewers - mixing beef and lamb options for our 7. The lady also asked if we wanted our skewers spicy but we opted out.   It took about 5-7 minutes for the skewers to cook and she gave it to us in a paper plate, without any tissues.   Piping fresh off the grill, the lamb tasted amazing. The beef... Not so much. My advice is just to go for the lamb - it was chewy, had a lot of taste, and the stuff they sprinkled on the skewer made it taste really good! Somehow the beef skewers lacked of this for some reason...  The lamb skewers was awesome but for that price and the amount of meat they gave - it is not worth it for me. The meat was puny (compared to some other places that I've seen) and that price did not justify the amount of meat given. Plus, no tissues given at all..  I might come here again only if I'm really craving skewers but as of now, I'm on a hunt for a really good skewer spot!!!!!"}
{"text":"Seasoning was very delicious, the meat quality was nice. BUT a little expensive!!! The meat cubes were kinda small and a little on a fatty side. But it was simple delicious"}
{"text":"What can I say, I don't even bother with the other skewered meat they sell, just the lamb. Sure, the lamb has uneven fatty spots, but it is the feel just the way I remembered and go after.  Though, for the same expectations on quality of meat, I find that the price is a bit too expensive.  I also wish they did sliced potato on a skewer like this with cumin spices and chillie powder as well. It almost makes me want to run to the grocery store and cook (almost!)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I went here every month at least for the past 2 years until today. As I ordered my 7 lamb kabobs for 10$, the lady that was making them sneezed all over the raw lamb.. As the other lady was handing me back the change about 10 seconds later, I asked if they would be at least giving the meat a quick rise or soak since she literally sneezed ONTO the meat without covering her face or anything. The change lady mumbled something that they will after some persuading, and I walked away to wait. The biggest thing that got me was that they didn't bother to until I mentioned something about it. I don't know if they even did after I walked away, and I would assume that it's common knowledge not to sneeze on the food prep in front of the customer who's ordering it but one thing is certain: I won't be going back.. As much as I love lamb kabobs and have never found another store that sold ones with the similar seasoning in Toronto, I'm too mortified to go back."}
{"text":"Great lamb skewers to satisfy cravings when there are no night markets to serve these!   A little more expensive than the night markets, but I noticed this had more meat than fat. The seasoning was delicious and they also serve other meats."}
{"text":"Great little snack shop and yummy. Some peices were quite fatty and had to be spared.  There is a little wait time as each kabob is prepared fresh and the spice level can be adjusted according  to your tastes.  There are many canned beverages but with all the drink shops, decisions really challenge you.  I just wish they had an option for a pita bread to wrap the meat in to enjoy, than to just eat off the skewer. Hence good for just a quick snack and not a true meal."}
{"text":"Went here along with friends in the pacific mall  food court. According to my friends, they are famous for their lamb skewer, the wait is long but you get to see the whole works, from beginning to the end. The smell is enough to drive you wild or perhaps I'm just so darn hungry. I'm not much of a lamb fans, but this, my friend, it was great! The flavor is amazing! Will definitely come back."}
