{"text":"Hands down the best wings I've ever had and the pizza is the only one in Pittsburgh that I don't have to blot with a napkin to absorb all the grease. Top it off with the nicest delivery guys on the planet and I can safely say that I will always be a customer. :D"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and entrees. I have tried the eggplant and chicken parm and they were both good. The pizza is also very good not over the top but very good. The staff and delivery personnel are also very nice. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Our family favorite pizza place, they put a crazy amount of cheese on their pizza and they have fast delivery. I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Venice is a good pizza place with decent prices and pick up specials.  We ordered pizzas and pepperoni rolls to take to a party.  I am not a huge fan of pepperoni but their rolls were very good.  The pizza was good.  Very small location. 

The location is a little tricky to get in and out of."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their hoagies. Huge, greasy and cheap. Pizza so-so"}
{"text":"I don't know why I never ordered from here before.  I was looking for a good steak hoagie so I gave it a shot.  My order was a Large Pepperoni pizza, whole Italian hoagie,  and Supreme Steak hoagie. I was not expecting the pizza to be this good. The sauce was sweet, the cheese was salty, the pepperoni has great flavor,  and the crust was soft and great taste. Italian hoagie was excellent, my daughter ate most of that. This was the steak hoagie I was looking for, juicy steak, fresh toppings,(mushrooms, peppers, onions,banana peppers,tomatoes and lettuce ) salty cheese. Soft bun not hard and burnt. And the hoagies  are big. Should become a regular delivery for us."}
{"text":"Wings are great, just wish you could order smaller sizes of them. Hoagies are huge but need more meat. The pizza is always good- only pizza I like around here!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in the area! The pizza is SO good and they deliver fast. You can order online and apply your tip, making the experience much easier. Only downfall is their pasta and fried foods. Not great. Everything else is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Note: This restaurant is 2-3 doors up from E.M. Pizzeria. I took the little woman here before she whisked me away to her Chippewa abode. 

Hmmmm. I'm struggling with how to rate Venice Pizzeria.

In terms of pizza alone, E.M. wins the duel, slightly. Both are about even in terms of crust (Venice's isn't as puffy or textured), cheese, and toppings. Venice is very stingy with their sauce, to the point where you can barely taste it. It's still a very good pizza however, my girlfriend turning me on to the bacon/black olive/pineapple combo, which particularly worked wonders on what might have been a somewhat bland pie if I had ordered it my standard mush-n-pep way. 

We also split a gyro hoagie since the g/f doesn't like tomatos or lots of spices and wants gyros any which way she can get 'em.

Man, are they cheapskates meatwise. 

And I should know better than to order gyros at pizzerias. 

It wasn't terrible mind you. The bread was terrific. I just HATE when pizzerias give you one slice of meat and stuff wads of lettuce and onion in between it to trick you. 

They didn't give us plates either. They must be used to everyone else getting takeout or delivery. Psst. Get a load of those weekend hours! 

E.M. gets the duke. Sorry."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Venice! Their food is great, the service is fantastic. Everyone is very friendly and we've felt like regulars since the first day we ordered!"}
{"text":"With no close competition, this is definitely the best place for local pizza. The delivery is always super quick and always hot and fresh. The pizza always comes with a side of ranch, which is clearly homemade and amazing! The men who work in the pizza place are always so nice and polite. Tonight I chose to finally leave a review because I picked up our normal order: the large carry out deal with half hot sausage and half plain and a half veggie hoagie with no mushrooms, dressing or cheese + banana peppers. Well, I got home and sadly there was cheese on my hoagie. My husband called and they were very apologetic and brought a fresh new one to our house literally within 15 minutes. 
Support local, not the big names which are also located pretty close to this location. Quality is key and they will not let you down or left hungry :)"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  I recommend the gyro calzone. The gyro meat is delicious, so is the tzatziki sauce. I can tell that they use fresh, high quality ingredients. My kids ordered burgers today & they both loved them! (They can be picky, so this is a huge bonus for us). I called to thank them & they were very polite on the phone as well. The delivery arrived promptly. This is definitely our favorite in the south hills!! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved into the area, and while waiting for our kitchen to be put together I decided to try some local pizza. I chose Venice because they had the most fliers in my mail.

So far I have tried:
Standard Pizza - they don't quite get the concept of adding \"extra sauce\" when asked, but it's ok, the pizza is delicious. I have crohn's and usually pizza ranges from GI Cautious to Gastric WMD. This pizza though has NO bad side effects, the few times this happens it is because the place uses quality cheese.

Perogie Pizza - Sadly this was bland. Could have used more garlic. PP is hard to make as most of the ingredients are bland to begin with.

Chicken Broccoli Alfredo Pasta - Ohhhhh this was delicious, and in a large portion! This is better than most \"Italian\" restaurants. Totally recommend!

Club Hoagie - After eating this I had a terrible feeling. It was so good that it felt like I had cheated on my wife. I couldn't look her in the eye for two entire days..."}
