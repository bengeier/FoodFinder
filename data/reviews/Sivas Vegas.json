{"text":"This place is really cool.  When you walk in, the environment is really unique and kinda sucks you into this strange Mediterranean world.  I usually go to a restaurant not just for the food but also for the environment, and this is a place I would probably take a client to.  The owners really went out of their way to find unusual furniture and make the setting stand out.  I'm a pretty big fan of that kind of effort.  I didn't really try much of the food, but I did go to the Hookah lounge and I think that place looked really cool.  There are a handful of hookah lounges in town, but most are pretty much the same and this one is really memorable.  I'll have to come back and try more of the menu.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to visit while I'm in Las Vegas!! Their combination of amazing Mediterranean food, hookah, and drinks is my number one go to. Their food is unbelievable so don't pass up on some amazing lamb chops! After definitely have some desert.. Baclava is to die for!! They have a great selection of hookah choices and a variety of cocktails to go with any occasion. My friends and I enjoyed the classy atmosphere and setup of this spot. They know what they're doing when it comes to food, hookah, and drinks. On top of everything service was amazing... they took care of me from the moment I walked in and they're so welcoming!!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant / bar tonight and it was amazing we tasted SivasVegaskebab and lamb which were great but l think my favorite one is Sivas Vegas kebab  for dessert we tried Kunefe which one was  tasty and crispy. They have a wonderful design and great atmosphere.Definitely l will come this restaurant again"}

{"text":"The food is great and the hookah pretty good.  The staff was exceptional.  beautiful cozy decor, with good music, but quiet enough for you to hang out and have conversations with friends.  If you're looking for good food and hookah, you gotta give siva a try."}
{"text":"I don't normally leave reviews unless I am blown away. Since I'm blown away I am writing one for this place. What an exceptional customer service but more importantly amazing food and classic drinks! The place is very clean the food was 5 stars for me. Thank you I will be back with the rest of my family and friends"}
{"text":"I was there and I could say this is the best place if you want to have best night. It's really good food and good hukkah. The quality of everything is the best. Staff really friendly and care about customer. Very clean and nice. We order hukkah , chicken kabobs , fruits, falafel...
Everything as really perfect. 
DON'T FORGET ORDER KUNUFE"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I had just had ramen at Jinya and weren't quite ready to leave but didn't want to take up the table. I was looking for a coffee place/lounge type of establishment within the strip mall behind Jinya when we came across Sivas. Looked it up on yelp and it had a whopping 5 stars. 

We were greeted immediately and told we could sit anywhere. Right off the bat the decor was very inviting. We went further inside to discover large tables where two were occupied with hookah patrons. Very luxurious attention given to detail and easily a perfect ambiance for date night. Great ventilation in place as we didn't get a strong whiff of hookah upon entry. 

We received our menus and saw there was a martini special for Tuesday's. Our waitress came and took our orders. I excitedly ordered the lychee martini because those are my favorite. After a short wait she returned with our drinks at which point she decides to let us know that not all the martinis are part of the special. And how were we to know that? There's no astrix, she didn't make any mention to this before. Seeing that we are visibly perplexed and confused she agreed to give us the special price but FYI'd us for our next round. There was no mention made of which martinis exactly are part of the special. 

Finally it's time to drink our drinks. One word - robitussin. Yuck! Literally all three were horrible! We struggled to have them go down. I wouldn't recommend ordering martinis or any cocktails for that matter. This place seems best for food and those that smoke hookah. 

I don't know that I have any reason to return but it's a cute little joint that plays throwback hip hop and R&B. They did change it to elevator music shortly. The waitress needs training both on the menu and bartending. 

UPDATE: My craving for ramen again called for another visit to Sivas. This experience was much better all around. We sat on the porch this time as it was a nice, warm day. They have comfy seating. Our drinks were much better than the last time, caution to anyone getting the mango jalape√±o drink it has a major kick. We were attended to frequently, music was on point. The smell as we walked in this time (potentially from hookah?) was just something else. I considered this place a gem last time because that was under control but it was awful this time around as was the bathroom upkeep. Which are minute things that I take very seriously. Sivas has great potential and I am hopeful they continue to grow. I was happy to come across their billboard across town, definitely going big or going home approach. I appreciate it and will recommend it to my loved ones!"}
{"text":"Went for a girls night out. The ambiance was very nice as well as the service.  The hookah was smooth and delicious and the food, it hit the spot. Overall it was a great experience and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here late last Saturday night for food and drinks and I am really impressed. I don't go out often so when I do, it's definitely a bonus when the service, food and drinks are killer. 

I had a Chicken Gyro Platter with Hummus and it was so damn good. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the hummus was the best I've ever had, the rice was flavorful, and the pita bread was soft. My friend had a beef and lamb gyro sandwich and she loved hers too! I've always thought Hummus is just hummus but theirs was so good I definitely over ate. haha. 

The drink was great. I think it was called a Berry Drop Martini. It was late so I only had 1 but I would have happily ordered a 2nd. And honestly, probably a 3rd. 

The service was great. Our server, Kate, was very welcoming and friendly and answered all our questions about the menu. I was stuck between a few options and her recommendations were spot on. Even tho the place was really busy, we always had everything we needed and she checked on us often. 

They do offer hookah, and many people had it at their tables but we did not order any so I cannot say how it was.

Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place. The atmosphere was great and lively and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great new spot. Love the vibe. Good food and good hookah. Taz is a chill dude and cares about service"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved from California and we were in need to find a new hookah spot here and we stumbled across this gem thanks to trustee yelp. What can I say, were ecstatic that we found it, because this place is amazing. From the friendly staff and owner, to the amazing DJ playing some bomb jams, to their delicious plates of food. My husband had the lamb and beef kabobs with rice and salad and I had the salmon with brown rice and salad and it was nothing less than finger licking good. We also ordered the calamari and hummus app and they did not disappoint either. Had some very yummy cocktails but I don't remember the names but they were yummy to say the least. Hands down, our new spot here in LV."}
{"text":"Came to this new place to check out the Mediterranean food.  The staff was very welcoming.  The food was excellent.  My husband had the mixed grill and I had vegetarian.  Both were very tasty.  Not hookah smokers and we're in a different area so it didn't affect our dining.  Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Not bad if you like hookah. Good DJ. Feel like it needs more of a booth then the tables takes a little away from it. Food was tasty but small portions."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this restaurant on Yelp during a weekend trip to Vegas while looking for a place to eat off the strip. It has a really comfortable lounge-like ambiance that I immediately appreciated. Our server, Taz, was welcoming and friendly and walked us through the menu. We ordered the Sivas kebab (a mixture of beef and lamb) and a falafel plate and waited for our food while sipping a very tasty mango cocktail that was quite spicy and absolutely delicious. Taz came back frequently to check on us and chat with us. I highly recommend ordering their kunefe for dessert, it's a perfect blend of savory and sweet with a terrific texture. The food was all very good, we really enjoyed our dinner here."}
{"text":"Really great drinks!!! I had the Mexican mule and my friend had the Ginger Lemonade. The bartender was literally cutting up fresh ginger, limes, mint etc. The owner was really nice. I have been to this establishment previously when it was a dive raggae spot. So when i say the renovations are incredable. The furniture and the fixtures throughout are beautiful. The bathrooms are beautiful as well. The hookah was great. I Really enjoyed my time and will definatley be back"}
{"text":"Top notch ambiance, quality food and superb hookah. Must try place. We ordered Sivas Kebab, Ribeye, liver and many others and all were awesome ! I will be back for sure.."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to this restaurant. I had the gyro beef and lamb and my husband has the chicken gyro place. It was the best Gyro I have ever had, light, good spice. I had the bulgar rice, nicely spiced. The hummus was the best hummus I have ever had, I typically do not like hummus, however after eating theirs I might have to reconsider. 

My husbands chicken was very tender, well spiced and delicious ingredients.

The salad was great, very good ingredients and dressing which is homemade.

The service was outstanding, we were attended to the minute we walked into the door and the service continue to be excellent  and the portions were very generous!

Hip place with good music, not to loud . They also have a hookah bar, well it is probably more hookah bar when you walk in but done be fooled their food and service is outstanding. 

We will be back and intend to bring our family as I am sure our boys will find this place a good hangout."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in Las Vegas so far. Very friendly services . Sivas kebab is perfect. Thank you"}
{"text":"They treat their customers amazing drinks are good and hookah is delicious come and check them out! Check in and get a shot!!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool new hot spot. It definitely has potential to be a hit. It's located in a good area. 

We decided to come here for a little girl bonding time. I saw this on yelp and knew it was a relatively new spot considering it only had 4 reviews. Upon entering we are automatically greeted and seated in the back. We ordered a large hookah ($5 off with yelp check in). We went with a popular flavor, watermelon mint. The hookah came out and it was huge! So big it couldn't even be put on the table had to stay on the floor which I didn't really like. So if you come here get a small hookah instead! 

Speaking of small hookahs they actually gave us a small one on the house! We got melon mint, honestly the smaller hookah was a bigger hit than the large one. 

We ordered many drinks one of my fav was the Berry drop. It legit tasted like juice. It's a creeper. We also ordered some appetizers, calamari and hummus. Nothing crazy but it did satisfy our munchies. 

And when we were paying, they brought out on the house shots! that was appreciated. The owner came out and greeted us. Everyone was nice there, very attentive. The restaurant was spacious and had a good atmosphere. Will probably return."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere! Drinks are great! The guys that work here are super kind and make you feel very at home! Completely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a fun place to hang out!  Great food, and a nice staff.  They have a few Mediterranean options that other places in town don't have and it was nice to try it out.  Everyone there is very kind and professional.  I'll probably come back the next time I'm on that side of town.  Maybe even try out the hookah"}
{"text":"We come here all the time!! Love this place! So amazing and service is so wonderful! Ask for taz!!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to hang out. They are super clean and way way better than the other hookah places. Their food is super tasty also. I wish I could give 10 stars."}
{"text":"Love me this hookah lounge!!! They have different stuff going on every night along with deals. Ask for taz or Kate! The small hookahs are the best and for some reason the mango flavor has you extra litttt.. plus they have dance floor  #twerrrkteam"}
{"text":"Came into this place with no expectations or no information. I left this place blown away, the owner ertan was extremely kind, knowledgeable and welcoming, we ended up staying for about 3 hours and invited a bunch of our friends to come join us.
We started off with a large hookah with a mint/strawberry flavor, and ended up getting another hookah as well as a refill.
I'm excited to come back and try the food!"}
{"text":"I wish if i lived here so i can come enjoy the good food, hookah and drinks and honestly wonderful service i wish u guys the best whenever am in the area ill make sure i stop by"}
{"text":"Best place evvvvvvver I come like 4 days a mfffff week tazzzzz is amazing Kate is amazing the owner is amazing this place shits on every single hookah place thank you so much for the owner and everybody else that opened this place you saved my life I love y'all thank you taz thank you for always being the shit thank you"}
{"text":"Great service; the owner and our server were very attentive and took care of us very well. Establishment is beautiful, hookah was amazing, and drinks are just as good. Well definately be back here. Thank you guys so much for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been by this place is golden... absolutely great lounge to chill, get a bite, drinks & hookah. Very clean with luxury seating and tasty drinks. They really know how to care for their guests. Experience much more then a typical happy hour place but with Happy Hour! Definitely recommend for large groups as they have many tucked in areas that can be private. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Fun place! Great service and amazing food! Found this based off the yelp reviews and they won't steer you wrong. Got a smaller hookah for 10$ since that's one of
their Monday specials!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very comparable to many hookah spots I've been to but bigger. The venue is immaculate. If you want to smoke some hookah and have a drink this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great vibe!! 10/10 would recommend! Came here with a friend and had the lamb chops and white chai hookah and everything was on point. I also recommend trying the Berry Drop cocktail :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Really great service by Liz the bartender. Great ambience. Awesome prices as well. Especially with it being so close to the strip."}
{"text":"I do not go anywhere near any Hookah Lounge. This place is not only a Hookah Lounge... I am surprised with the level of detail and furnishing. 

It's a cross over between casual dining and fine dining.

The reason i am hooked up with this place they are doing the best authentic Turkish Mediterranean cuisine in the town. Staff is top pro, environment is not noisy so you can chat with your friend but still nice house music on the background, Food is really tasty...

It's brand new, do yourself a favor, check it out, you will thank me for my review later :)"}
{"text":"You must check this spot out!  I was there last night with a group of friends and I had a blast!! 
There was a DJ playing music while we enjoyed our drinks, danced, and mingled.

This is a good place to hang out with friends and family.  The ambiance is very classy and upscale (good for hosting parties and celebrations). They also have huge screen TVs so you can catch the game and have a drink. The decor is very elegant. You can get dressed up or come casual. 

They have delicious Mediterranean food (best bread I've ever had!) My favorite dishes are the Spanakopita, Hummus, Babagabush and the Kabobs. They also have amazing lambs dishes. The Greek salad had one of the best dressings I've had. The plates range start at $7 and go up.

They have the best Hookah in town.  They have daily specials, especially during Happy Hour (half priced appetizers and drinks specials) and Hookah + Food specials for $25 (see restaurant for details). Hookahs start at $10 depending on the size and refill.  There also have music and a variety of drinks. 

It is located inside a shopping center strip with plenty of free parking.  The staff is awesome and service is great. Everyone there is very kind and professional.  I had a great time!I definitely recommend this placewill be a regular spot for me!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, super clean, affordable hookah and drink specials. Tahz was a great server and had some great recommendations. If you like hookah, drink specials, or Mediterranean food then this is your place :D

Ps. Sivas kabobs are legit"}
{"text":"My Uber driver suggested this place and I'm so glad he did. The ambiance was amazing and the food was even better! We had a great server named Tez! And the hookah actually gave me a buzz. Coming back definitely!"}
{"text":"Came here late night on a Monday with a party of three and our waitress Kate was very attentive to our needs and honestly provided the best service I had received in a long time! I just moved to Las Vegas and found my new go to spot to smoke some hookah and relax."}
{"text":"Was amazing. Nearly perfect taste and wonderful service. When k visit Vegas again I will totally come back."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone who loves hookah and drinks. Best hookah lounge open late. And let me tell you this place is beautiful!!!!"}
{"text":"Food and hookah was amazing And so was the bartender Liz! Everyone was so friendly and accommodating. It was pretty busy!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to have a night out and we were looking for food, hookah, and a bar.  We looked at what was near to find this new restaurant called Sivas Vegas.  No one objected so we checked it out.  When you walk in, the first thing you notice is the dark, beautiful scenery.  The room has low lighting, and high focus  on lots of great artworks that are of a vaguely middle eastern/European motif.  This adds a lot to the experience if you go out looking for cool environments to spend time with your friends.  Seating was comfortable, and the servers were attentive to us as we sat down.  The menu was pretty vast and had a lot of great options for people who have dietary restrictions or preferences like I do.  So if you're a vegetarian, you'll have plenty of choices.
Everything we ordered was pretty tasty, but we headed to the bar soon after so I can't really say that I remember much of the food specifically.  The drinks in at the bar are really strong.  I'm happy about that.
After the dinner, we made our way to the hookah lounge part of the restaurant.  The owners really spent some time to develop the space.  The only way to describe it is cool.  You just feel pretty cool being in there.  It's almost like a members only club of some kind but of course it's open to the public.  I will definitely go back again soon so I can try more flavors."}
{"text":"The first thing I can say it's a little different.  The d√©cor is really cool and gives that laid back, European vibe while somehow staying pretty hip.  The staff are all very nice, and no one had any problems with my order or the fact that I made special requests.  So that was nice.  
Everything I ordered was really tasty.  Easily some of the best Mediterranean food I've had in town, and I go to a lot of those places. I also really liked the faint smell of all of the different hookah flavors they had going in the other room.  Overall the place had a really nice and luxurious feel to it without being too pretentious.  I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean food. Their Sivas Kebab is well seasoned and delicious! Friendly staff and great service. The Hookah was really good too!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant and hookah place ever with the best service and friendly staff. If you ever want to feel home, go there. Thank you Sivas place for the good time!"}
{"text":"Food: Food is barely ok and it is very overpriced. Their happy hour menu is a joke. 

Customer service was appalling. Possibly one of the worst I ever experienced worldwide. Our server forgot EVERY order both food and drinks wise! 

Place smells and try to smack on the chairs and you'll see so much dust.

Disgusting. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Awesome local shisha spot. Outstanding service by Taz and the staff! Great food on the menu as well. Very luxurious atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night for the first time for dinner and this place was amazing. My server Kate was phenomenal. I was stuck on what to order and she gave amazing recommendations. I ended up ordering a lamb and beef gyro and when it was made wrong she had it fixed immediately.  The drinks were strong and she gave great recommendations on that as well.  The vibe in this place was really kool . Great music playing and a nice patio outside.  I didn't try it but they also offer hooka. If you are looking for great Mediterranean food absolutely check this place out."}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for a good, meaty low carb meal. All I can say is wow! The food was fresh and delicious. The steak was honestly better than most steak houses we've been to lately. We appreciated the attention to detail from our server and really enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Found this place on Instagram and it was definitely a great choice for date night!!! They just recently opened but they have great potential! Liz at the bar made great drinks and the owner is SUPER NICE! I will definitely be back and can't wait to bring my girls for HAPPY HOUR! The patio seating will be great when the weather is consistently nice! Thank you SIVA!"}
{"text":"This place is so nice inside. Great place for locals. Great for a date night or night out with the girls. I enjoyed the food, service and hookah!"}
{"text":"Came in from out of town for a weekend in Vegas. Ended up at this Hookah spot. Never did hookah before but I loved it. Good drinks, great music, and great vibe. The place was extremely clean and the guys working there were real cool. 
I'd definitely comeback. Next time I'll try some of the food. If I lived in Vegas I'd probably be here often just as a kick back spot."}
{"text":"People, do yourself a favor and give this place a visit. THE BEST Mediterranean food in town!, the best cocktails too!. Went here with hubby, and had awesome time!. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"One of the nicest and most relaxed hookah bars I've been to. Excellent service all around from the bar. Food is amazing and atmosphere wants to bring you back for more. Thank you to the manager and Tez for the great experience!"}
