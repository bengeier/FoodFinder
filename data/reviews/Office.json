{"text":"Awesome pizza selection with the ability to not only select toppings but sauces and crust! Fabulous! Nice Sunday stop!"}
{"text":"The bartender Judy only gave me a customer copy of my receipt when I asked for the merchant copy to ensure the tip was placed in correctly ...she refuse to give it to me, we had to have a friend refuse to sign her receipt to get a copy no doubt the bartender Judy planned on writing in her own tip. not a way to treat a regular customer who brings in new business regularly, done with the office."}
{"text":"This is a typical Parma area neighborhood hole in the wall bar. There are not one but two lottery machines you can play while you are drinking. There are a couple TVs so you can watch local Cleveland sports. The bartenders are friendly and it seems like everybody knows their name.   The unassuming front continues into the unassuming inside. This is not the Taj Mahal this is a neighborhood hang out and it's perfect for that.   It's easy to miss this place it's in a small strip mall. I hear you can get pizza from the place next-door that is also good but we did not try it. The drinks were priced pretty reasonably and the service was prompt.   I would definitely come back again if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We spent the night before our wedding here and had an absolute ball! The bartenders are friendly and this hole-in-the wall pub is a local joint. Always a friendly face and great karaoke on Saturdays. Also, they are joined with A Slice Above which had the best pizza in town. Hard to beat this place!"}
