{"text":"I first came across a Scores while staying in Montreal by the airport and left wishing there was one in Toronto...Guess what I found today! This is a new, clean restaurant that is a well established chain in Quebec, basically Swiss Chalet on steroids. Bigger chickens, more crispy fries and the best part is the all you can eat salad bar - even has soup.
Drawback is the not so central location and no deserts in the salad bar besides the fruit.. But at $25 to $30,- for 2 I think it's a great deal"}
{"text":"Horrific.  Even my kids wouldn't eat the chicken and they eat everything.  The place is a bad copycat of Swiss Chalet.  Dry chicken, cold fries, nasty salad bar.  the stuffing was soo dry, it was comical.  Do your self a favor and drive the extra 5 minutes to Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off-night, but tried the chicken dinner at Scores and wasn't particularly impressed.

Chicken itself was very reminiscent of Swiss Chalet, just missing the wonderful flavor.  It was a little dry, and the gravy it was served with was overly salty.

They got a huge salad bar, but it's filled with a lot of non-salad things (well, like potato salad and fruit). Not much to actually build a 'normal' salad with (like, uh, mushrooms?).

These guys are supposedly known for their ribs - maybe I just made a mistake ...

Willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, but if I'm in a chicken mood, I'd head for the nearest Swiss Chalet."}
