{"text":"Loder's is a staple in North Royalton. It's been around for at least 40 years that I can remember.   They've added different ice creams over the years and serve food as well. I haven't had the food but can certainly say the quality of the ice cream is very good!  The only suggestion I have is that the dining area is not that comfortable. I'm not a fan of the molded plastic seats."}
{"text":"After driving past this place for years, we finally decided to stop for dinner. What a gem! Their food was a surprise: One of the best burgers I've had in a long time (double cheese) and the kids chowed down their nuggets and fries. My wife raved about her burger as well. Then came the 'main event'. Ice Cream! My son had the strawberry shake, but only after wrestling it out of my hands, my daughter had a scoop of strawberry with sprinkles and it was all very good. We'll make this a regular stop from now on."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place but now the food gets lost and the large fries are half full. Many workers interested in talking with their friends versus serving the customers. Wont be coming back, HAD been going for years. This is why small businesses are failing."}
{"text":"This place is undeniably good-- I've been visiting it since I was a kid. If you order food there will be a pretty decent waiting time but I always enjoy the end result. My only complaint about the Shake Shoppe is that they always employ young girls who seem to have an attitude. They have no problem making anything with ice cream, but will most likely roll their eyes if you order food. If you can stomach teenage girls, then it is worth trying! I always get excited when it opens back up in the spring :)"}
{"text":"I like the ice cream, but the service usually sucks at the drive through"}
{"text":"With this being in my hometown, I don't think I've gone a year without stopping at the Shake Shoppe for some ice cream.   I've had many fond memories here, from elementary school all the way through high school. Now I bring my 4 year old and he absolutely loves it.  Sentimental value aside, their ice cream selection is pretty good. They're sundaes are HUGE! I saw this little girl there this evening who had a banana split and it was the size of her head, haha!"}
{"text":"I got the \"beef burger\" off the menu at drive through. It was about 3.20. What a rip off! All it was was a choppy looking beef patty on a bun. No condiments, was I supposed to ask for those? Maybe those are more? Maybe they don't have condiments? It would have been nice to have been asked or informed. The burger was maybe worth 1.00 in my opinion. Next time I would go down the street to Burger King or McDonalds...   Also the ice cream was freezer burned!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  I have came here a few times, because it is very convienient for me as it is close to where I live. After my past two experiences here, my boyfriend & I will never go back.  The second-to-last time I came here, they forgot to make my ice cream. My boyfriend got his and we sat and waited for mine for a few minutes, finally looking over to the counter to see two employees chatting and doing nothing. He went up there and mentioned they forgot my ice cream. They made it, but had no care for it at all.  This past week when we went again, we ordered and sat to wait for our ice cream. There was hardly anyone in there, not busy at all. The girl who took our order took her time talking to other employees and basically doing nothing until she decided she wanted to start making our ice cream almost 5 minutes later, it was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Please beware that they fry the french fries, onion rings & SHRIMP in the same oil. I asked an employee & she confirmed that they are fried in the same oil. The problem is I am allergic to shell fish and  didn't notice they served shrimp until I was eating my last onion ring. Next time it will just be a shake for me."}
{"text":"As an ice cream fanatic I was disappointed by the lack of milkshake options that were offered. When advertised as the \"Shake Shoppe\" I imagined millions (well, maybe not millions) of options for shakes. The two times I've gone the choices left little to be desired so I've opted for the mediocre ice cream cones. However, I will say that the boy has gotten a shake both times and after a small taste I could taste a superior homemade flavor. The blueberry and peanut butter were awesome. However, overall I've had better."}
{"text":"Best sundaes in North Royalton!!! Large selection of ice creams also...never tried one of their famous burgers though"}
