{"text":"Only been here once, but the food was excellent. I tried their pizza and salad, and my taste buds were on fire! Original taste, fresh and homemade Italian food. The staff were awesome too. Love the quaint location and atmosphere. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Straight from Sicily! Don't miss this hidden gem in the middle of a residential neighborhood.   Great food, and great service all with a New York style attitude. 
The pizza, pasta, eggplant parmigiana, and desserts are not to be missed! 
Basil & Garlic's subs are delicious and generous...WOW!  Treat yourself to a fantastic lunch instead of those all too familiar chain deli sandwiches!

We just had my wife's and daughter's birthday celebration in the restaurant with 35 guests and it was a huge success. 
Claudio, Nadine and their staff are passionate about what they do and you will not be disappointed!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Let's first correct a few inaccuracies in the Yelp information - they DO accept reservations and they DO have outside dining. Beyond that, Basil & Garlic was excellent in every respect. They have a small dining area inside and slightly larger area out and the waitstaff works hard to provide the best hospitality and service. They treat you like family. We passed on the starters and went right to the pasta which has to be some of the best in the entire valley. The flavors and portions were ample and overall a great value. They don't serve liquor so BYOB and the corkage fee is only $4.50."}
{"text":"Friday is Pizza night. We've been coming in or taking out almost every Friday since they open.We love the Sicilian pizza and the Shrimp parm hero's. We even had couple of family get togethers there. My kids love their meatballs and penne pasta. We're on our way now, see you there!"}
{"text":"Somehow Basil and Garlic, which has the worst service I've ever experienced, has such good reviews. 

We had to ask a very sassy waiting staff three times for water--water! The calamari had no taste. The pizza, which took forty-five minutes to come, fell apart when we lifted it up.

I would rather go to Dominos."}
{"text":"My man Claudio did it! This food is top notch. The Pizza is the best I've had and I can say the same for everything else I've had here. If your looking for great quality Italian food than you have to go to Basil & Garlic Bistro!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a visiting friend, which was okay, but not as expected.  I guess I was a bit misdirected as I thought it was a nicer, higher end place, and it turned out to be an older place, sort of run down, not a destination, but the pizza was good, salad average, prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Authentic, yummy and wonderful staff!  This place is the real deal!!  Sauce is great, sandwiches awesome too.  We gotta go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Chose to celebrate a birthday @Basil & Garlic w/ friends and family. We sat outside in their quaint patio area surrounded by herb garden plants and lights. It was perfection with sweet and attentive service. 

The food was TO DIE FOR! Super fresh and served hot, which is a must when eating Italian food. I asked for extra garlic on virtually everything and they obliged en force.

And no Yelp, they did not have 'Gender Neutral Restrooms' you freaks."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place based upon the other reviews, but alas it wasn't meant to be. We were greeted and told to choose a table, and after 15 minutes we left without ever receiving a menu or another glance. The food may be great but the service, or lack there of, does not meet a minimum standard."}
{"text":"Have come back multiple times often ordering seafood pasta dishes which are always generous and tasty.  Their daily specials are almost always worth ordering."}
{"text":"We went for the first time as it's in our (new) neighborhood. The food was very good and certainly reasonably priced, however it took FOREVER for us to get the food - over an hour for a calzone and spaghetti dish.  This is a lot of time to wait for an adult, much less our seven year old. Will try again based upon the food and prices, but another slow experience like this one and it will be our last!"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing food. After living in Italia for some time, I've come to know proper Italian food - not an easy find here in the states. This menu was perfect. The white pizza I had was delicious with real flavors and not greasy. Great crust.  I was full, but had to try the pasta the rest of my family had - that too, best pasta I've had in Scottsdale.  I'm so excited to have found this place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service. Very down to earth place where you can spend an evening and enjoy delicious food!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but this family-run restaurant tucked into the northwest corner of 92 and Poinsettia is exceptional.  The pizza is perfect and reminds me of real Brooklyn pizza with a perfect crust, the right amount of cheese and served hot.  I recently had the mussels in red sauce.  It may have been the best I've ever had!  My prediction is that we'll be hearing more about Claudio and Nadine."}
{"text":"Love supporting local family owned restaurants! We had a great dinner here tonight and we will certainly be back. Excellent Bolognese sauce!"}
{"text":"We ordered garlic bread with cheese, battered mushrooms and a pizza for takeout.

The mushrooms were the highlight.  The batter was crisp and light without being greasy and the mushrooms inside were tender and delicious.  The garlic bread had much too strong of a garlic flavor and I wasn't able to eat more than a few bites before I gave up.

We ordered our pizza with pepperoni, mushroom and sausage.  I expected it to be a little greasy due to the toppings, but it was so greasy it overpowered the flavor.  It's not something I'd order again.

Basil & Garlic may be a victim of high expectations based on the reviews here, but I don't think we saw enough to come back for a second try even though the mushrooms were pretty decent."}
{"text":"Came for lunch during the week. Sat outside next to an Italian speaking family..... Hmmm this has potential! We split a lovely small calzone, which we couldn't finish, and a side salad. 
Very low- key, family place in a little strip mall (everything is in a strip mall in Phoenix).   I am PICKY PICKY with food and would absolutely eat here again. Good service and yummy food."}
{"text":"Dinner this evening was superb. Although I ate alone due to a cancelled date, the service was impeccable. 
I ordered a side salad to begin with. Full of so many different fresh vegetables. Along with the homemade baguettes it started what was to be an unforgettable dinner.
The entree I ordered was Chicken Florentine with a side of Rigatoni. Two big chicken breasts grilled in a wonderful buttered garlic sauce topped with provolone and fresh sauteed spinach. It was DELICIOUS. This was not on the menu as an entree, but I had this previously as a sandwich, so Claudio (the owner and head chef) made it up for me. I barely had room to finish this scrumptious meal . . . but I did.
Wonderful experience. Highly recommend this off the wall Italian Bistro. Try it"}
{"text":"This restaurnat just opened this week.  The owners are a young couple who recently relocated from Europe and converted a closed pizza shop into a great bistro.  As I approached the opened door early one morning to see what was going on, I was overcome by a wonderful aroma of sauce cooking on the stove.  I picked up a menu and told the owner I would return.  I placed an order a couple of days later and I have to say the food was just great.  The pizza was probably the best I had since leaving NY many years ago.  It certainly was better than anything I have tasted in Scottsdale.  The taste was unbelievable.  The salads were large, fresh and were big enough to share.  There were several people eating at the tables and the pasta dishes looked delicious.  I was sorry I only ordered a pizza and salad.  That ok since I know I will be back there in a couple of days with my family.  The prices are very reasonalbe and I want to try everything on the menu.  Best of luck to the new owners and I will see you soon."}
{"text":"Great food and even better people at this charming little spot. We were treated like dear friends. Everyone else in there seemed to be regulars, being greeted by name, etc. We waited forever for our dinner, but it was well worth it. We can't wait to become regulars, too!"}
{"text":"Quiet, little neighborhood spot. Food was great and portion sizes were large. I like the  family owned atmosphere.  Will definitely go back, i really want to try a pizza next time."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend so we gave it a try for dinner on a week night. Loved the fresh made pizza crust and service, but not much else. The decor is sadly neglected, drab, and cluttered. We sat at a window table overlooking a dog run owned by the groomers next door. The window shade was stuck and could not be lowered, the window glass was cracked. Half way through dinner, a large dog came to the window and barked at us then proceeded to do his business a few steps away. 

A very plain Caesar salad arrived with dressing on the side. Toss it yourself? Never saw that before! The calamari was tasty but chewy. The pizza crust was delicious but covered with an overload of bland toppings. We both think there is a great potential here, but for now, we will not recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, especially if you like comfort food Italian style.  The decor and furniture leaves something to be desired, but BYOB is great because there is a mini-mart that sells wine next door.  This is a bargain to be sure."}
{"text":"WOW. We drove by this place hundreds of times but never stopped in until a friend recommended we try it. It has now become a regular \"go to\" for date night, quick bites, or nights we're lazy and don't want to cook. The food is absolutely phenomenal. Probably one of the top Italian food joints in Scottsdale, if not the state. The staff is always helpful, polite, welcoming and very knowledgeable about their entire menu. If you go I strongly urge you to get the Boscaiola. I've tried pretty much everything on menu but I keep coming back to the Boscaiola. The dining atmosphere is 'intimate' and very casual. It's also BYOB so we typically show up with a bottle of red. If you forget to BYOB, their is small market next door that'll get ya through ;)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Homemade bread and marinara are delicious.  We've been here a few times and have always had a wonderful meal.  Need to get them on DDD - Diners Driveins and Dives."}
{"text":"Excellent little family owned restaurant tucked in the corner at 92nd St and Poinsettia.
They have been open 7 weeks and seem to already have a crowd of regulars dining in and picking up.
Delicious pizza with an amazing, light and crispy crust. Had the San Daniele white pizza with fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, tomatoes and arugula. They have medium or large. The medium is huge! The antipasto salad is large enough to share with 3 people. You can BYOB but there is a $4.50 corkage fee."}
{"text":"Went there with my family. It was amazing! We had the lasagne, mozzarella sticks, pepperoni pizza, and the meatball sub. All of which were delicious! Being a Nutella lover, I had to try the Nutella pizza (made with the pizza crust, Nutella, and topped with strawberries). As everything else, it was amazing! Will be going back many more times! Everyone at the restaurant was so friendly and welcoming! The owner, Claudio was genuinely nice."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome mom and pop joint and they make yummy food. I ordered take out and everyone was so kind and helpful. As I waited for my order Tony was so sweet and helped entertain my 16month old. He was so kind and sweet. When my order was up he offered to help cary to my car as I was carrying my little one. I am so glad this place is close to me, we will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I want to start out by saying it was my first time coming here and definitely not my last. This place by far has the best pizza in AZ. 

I tried the Quattro Formaggio (4 cheese) pizza and the blend of taste along with the dough texture made this pizza lights out. I also ordered the basil and garlic pasta with linguini which was delicious. 

This place is a great family owned business where they treat everyone like family. This is a hidden gem and eventually it will become everyone's favorite."}
{"text":"My daughter raves about this place and I thought it would be a great Friday to try it since I didn't want to cook.  I'm so glad I got lazy. We had to wait a bit for seating since all the tables were filled. 

The restaurant is a small quaint place with about 9 or 10 tables (I recall 8 tables which seat 4 and 1 or 2 that seat 2).  We ordered our meal family style so we could try several dishes.  We started out with the Calamari. It was a nice plateful that was easily shared with our party of 6. The calamari was fried to perfection with a very light batter and a side of marinara sauce. It was served with fresh baked homemade bread which gave us a way to 'sop' up any extra marinara sauce.

Our entrees came shortly after. We ordered Vongole on spaghetti (they ran out of linguini) in white sauce, Quattro Formaggi penne, Rucola e Gamberetti on sedani, and the Quattro Formaggi pizza with pepperoni on 1/2 of it.  All I can say is WOW! WOW! WOW! I'd be a fat cow if I lived by this place... Each dish was so flavorful and portioned for this family of 5 adults and a kid. You could tell there was no shortcutting on any of the ingredients that were placed into each dish. You can taste the love, pride, and warm hearted delight that the owners want to share with each and every bite. We topped off our evening with homemade spumoni, cannoli, and tiramisu... Well worth ALL the calories - no regrets!

My daughter and her boyfriend are regulars to this restaurant since moving just under 2 miles away. Claudio and Nadine recognize them and made sure they came by the table after dinner was done.  Claudio did visit each customer table through the time we were there too. The husband and wife duo were so friendly and down to earth.  I love that they like to make their customers feel valued and appreciated for visiting them. I can easily see how my daughter fell in love with this bistro and the people that run it. 

All in all, the rainy day excuse (aka lazy) was the BEST reason NOT to cook last night. 

HIGHLY recommended and I WILL be sharing this little diamond in the desert."}
{"text":"We visited this little restaurant last week and it was great! It is a family owned business and everyone working was super nice and eager to please. The pizza was delicious and fresh and some of the best I have had. Everything is made in house and you can tell. We also got the pasta bolognese which was good. While waiting for our takeout I saw a plate of spaghetti and meatballs go by and it looks amazing, something I will have to try next time. The only cons would be that it lacks in decor and is very small, but something that is easy to get over since the food is outstanding. It is also very clean (which is a must) so if you are looking for a casual place to grab dinner, or just to get takeout, please give this place a chance!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. I'm so happy we did. The food was amazing. The menu didn't have a specific vegetarian pasta and the chef created a dish based on my needs. My husband had one of the speciality subs and that equally excellent. They served fresh bread right out of the oven that was awesome too!! You must try this place. Great and super friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"This place is small and it was not a great experience.  We had six people and was told   that the wait was 15 mins for dinner.  It was actually 25 mins.  The place seemed to have plenty of help, but had a help wanted sign in the window.  Since it probably only holds 40 people max, I'm not sure how any people were needed.  It took us 5 mins to get drinks.  And another 5 to order.  After waiting another 45 for our food, we told the waitress we were in a hurry and had to get our son to the Ice Den for hockey.  My son ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  How long does it take for spaghetti and meatballs???
So, his order comes out fast and everyone's else's except mine comes out 10 mins later.  Since we are in a hurry, I start eating my son's spaghetti while he has to leave.  I asked the waitress where's my food (a calzone) and the kitchen and waitress start a commotion and panic blaming that it went to table 6 (we were table 7).  However, I didn't see a calzone on any table.  Well, the kitchen never made my food.  I have never, ever been to a restaurant where my food was never ordered or the waitress never saw that my food was there.  Or even checking up.  We never got drink refills either.  Even after removing the drinks from the bill, it wasn't enough."}
{"text":"Total family owned neighborhood gem.  They use your name when speaking to you as if you're really a guest in their home.  The food is fantastic....fresh, made to order, authentic....just delicious.  The interior is a little dated and simple but you're focused on the food and service which are above and beyond.  This is the kind of place that makes you want to support local businesses!"}
{"text":"We were visiting in town and tried this place. The Stromboli was fantastic! The pizza was greatand portion sizes were big. Friendly employees too!! Any chance you could start shipping your yummy food to California??"}
{"text":"Best meatball I've ever had! This Is my first time eating here and I'm very impressed with the service and the food"}
{"text":"Fabulous. Thought the first time might have been an anomaly so went back and now we can't wait to get back! Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Go with one of the specials everytime! The chef here is amazing! Just had the bruschetta chicken pasta and it was so good! The chicken was moist, the tomatoes and fresh basil with mozzarella cheese tasted so fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"If you like family-owned, authentic Italian, you will love Basil & Garlic Bistro.  The San Daniele pizza is phenomenal, and the pastas are great.  Start with the antipasto salad and finish with the Nutella pizza.  

Wonderful place, nice owners."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The ambience is fantastic.  Staff is friendly.

It's BYOB, which works great for people like me who love great vino, but hate paying 300% more for it off the restaurant's list.  

Ordered the white Sole pizza for take-out...has spinach, ricotta cheese, artichokes, sundried tomatoes and garlic.  Really well done.  

Can't wait to get here and dine-in with someone special.  

Well done.  A hidden gem in the neighborhood.

Don't tell TOO many people!"}
{"text":"The best italian I've had in so long!! It's family owned, everything from scratch, flexible and accommodating for how you like your dishes! The brandy cream sauce is the BEST thing you'll put in your mouth, I promise. Shannon was an amazing server, all around fabulous experience. Oh, btw it's BYOB! Oh AND best cannoli in town"}
{"text":"Omg, I'm so glad we found this place and I can almost walk to it (if I weren't so lazy), otherwise I would have to move closer.

This is the kind of place you look for when traveling, an unassuming, down-home, authentic hole in the wall that only the natives know about.

I took my Mom here last week to celebrate what would have been Dad's 94th birthday. Kinda a sad-happy day, but aside from the great food we found Claudio the owner-chef who is from Sicily and of course speaks Italian...this thrilled Mom having someone to speak Italian with. I also enjoyed listening...it was great and took our minds off the day.

Forget the decoration/decor...un-important...you are here to eat real Italian food.

We both had eggplant parmigiana, Mom had the ciabatta sandwich and I had the plate with rigatoni. The ciabatta was huge, seriously big enough for 2 people to share and was only like 7 bucks.

The dinner plate was also huge, I only at half there, at some for dinner at home and the rest for breakfast the next day. Yes, folks...that's one of my tests for good food, if it tastes too the next morning for breakfast...it gets a star.

Why was it taking so long to cook? Well I gotta think Claudio cooks to order, because this was the absolute BEST eggplant parm. I've had (except for mine :-). The eggplant was sliced thin and lightly breaded, the sauce was to die for, and the cheese was excellent. The rigatoni was excellent as well.

Plenty of parking
No liquor license but 30' away is a deli you can buy beer or wine and you can byob.
Out-Door Seating
Credit Cards

Definitely going back and has replace my other neighborhood Italian restaurant. I will be working my way down their menu for sure!"}
{"text":"Basil & Garlic is one of those great neighborhood places that I hope too many people don't find out about. The service has always been good and the quality of the food served is top notch. I especially recommend the antipasto salad and their large 16\" inch square pizza. Additionally, their dinner entrees and desserts have always exceeded our expectations. Lastly, this establishment is a BOB place so your bill is much more reasonable for a good meal."}
{"text":"The chef got mad, when I sent Lasagna back as it was overloaded with sauce.
Then a different waitress, not Danni who was great,
asked if we would take Lasagna anyway?
After, I sent it back twice.
Asked to speak to Chef/owner, he was irritated as i shared that too much sauce gives indigestion.
My friend, who is a goof..paid for the Lasagna.
Not the first time, I have been here..food is usually good. But this was really bad business!
WILL NOT RETURN EVER!!!
The posted pic is a Master Chef at Steak 44..he would be very disappointed by the service and handling of the situation! SO DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted. It is operated by a very nice couple who is a great chef and they provide great service. A friend and I found this place via Yelp!!! We had no idea this Hidden Treasure was located in the edge of a neighborhood. They do not not serve wine but you can BYOB."}
{"text":"Small, neighborhood spot. Checked it out because of the reviews. Being 50% Sicilian, sauce is critical. It did not disappoint. If you want a big, corporate Italian restaurant, don't go here."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and we finally went to check it out. 
The food is delicious!! 

We ordered a 14\" cheese pizza that was very good, (I am from NYC and have had better). Not really a knock on Basil and Garlic. 
We also had the shrimp and pasta which was excellent, lots of Garlic, yumm! 
One of us had the Lasagna and I had the Chicken Parm which is very good.
They were short handed that night and service was pretty slow. 
The owner Nadine came over and apologized and explained the situation about finding good people to work there.

We went back again 3 weeks later and the place was packed, it took 30 minutes to get seated. 
Again the food was great and the service was much better, it looked like they hired a couple of additional people to work the kitchen end of the restaurant.

Now if they could expand in that small shopping center to add more seating, 
because Basil and Garlic is a real Gem of a find in a industry littered with franchise junk restaurants.

Pro's, Great Food, moderate prices, Not part of a chain, a neighborhood place.
BYOB-The market south of them has an extensive Beer and Wine inventory.
Outside seating area


Con's- Unassuming décor, small seating area, can get noisy when there is a large party in the room.

I have driven by this strip mall 40x over the past 2 years and never knew it was there,
I am thrilled I know that B&G is tucked in there now."}
{"text":"Wow. We ordered the 4 cheese pizza and it was FANTASTIC!  Chatted with the owner, he is from Brooklyn and so funny.  I love finding local places like this to support."}
{"text":"It have been on a personal streak of leaving 3 star or less reviews (2 in a row) so I felt I needed to wrangle up a 5 star review. The first spot I could think of was this place. I came here a few months ago and had a great time. It is extremely bare bones but the people and the food are what make this 5 star. I had the best pizza of my life here by some guy walking around in pajamas--it was one of the owners. This is a small shop where you feel like family. Delicious food and personal service make this an easy 5 star."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time I had the shrimp in wine sauce special dish for the night. I was asked what pasta I wanted and I chose rigatoni.  After a long wait for our meals the waitress came out and said something about not having enough and a longer wait but I could have penne now. It takes less than 10 min to cook pasta so I'm not sure what that was all about. The meal came out and it was so bland - no flavor- not worth the wait at all.  They forgot the name of their restaurant - because had they put basil and garlic in the dish the dish might have gotten a higher score.  When I told the waitress it was bland, she didn't seem to care or she has heard that before.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"First time there.  We had a cheese and veggie pizza, meatball and their basil, garlic, and shrimp pasta, and the chicken Marsala special.  Overall, the flavor profiles were Ok.  The pasta was cooked just right but the ratio of pasta to sauce was way off.  The pasta was basically drenched in sauce, and there was frankly not enough pasta or way too much sauce.  The pizza was Ok - would not go there just for the pizza.  

It's a very casual and small spot, but the prices were a bit higher than they should be for that place.   We won't be back again."}
{"text":"Small, neighborhood restaurant. The service and employees are nice. I have had the lasagna multiple times now and it is quite disappointing. It isn't very flavorful."}
{"text":"First, It is in a small stripmall tucked in the middle between a vet and a convience store. Don\"t let that throw you, food is awesome. It is BYOB with a small patio outside and dining inside. We pasta and a meatball sandwich. Pasta was fresh and full of flavor, the meatball sandwich was the best I have eaten in Arizona. I am from Chicago and this sandwich rates right up there with all the one's from back home. The service was great. Will be going back."}
{"text":"I would like to try this neighborhood spot again...the caprese salad was good, the pizza my mom ordered for herself was good (except for the blue cheese-not my thing!) and above all, the Nutella pizza was delicious. Still, I was disappointed by my alla vodka pasta dish--it was not even pink, as it tends to be, it was orangey. In summation, I did not love my own dish, but other dishes we had were tasty. So, I'd like to return and give some other dishes a shot! :)"}
{"text":"the BEST Pizza ever. Freshest dough and perfect toppings. This is a great Sicilian restaurant. Very casual atmosphere. Chef Claudio is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Went twice since we were staying at a nearby hotel....
First night was fantastic, great service,
Very attentive and Friendly.
Prices very reasonable 
Second night horrible service, slow x10,
Not very friendly and not attentive at all.
4 tables near us were not cleared and were never cleared during our visit, gross to see nasty plates of leftover food while your trying to enjoy your dinner.
 OMG, this is suppose to be an Italian Bistro and they have the most irritating JAZZ in that it actually makes you want to stab yourself with your butter knife.....Change the tunes!! Jazz is only good in a Jazz bar, most people find it offensive and over powering.
Food was great the second night as well, service BAD, waited way to long for our check...then had to locate someone to get our change back....
Gave them a 100 bill for a 64.00 tab.....
Don't assume your tip!! That's still our choice, tipped our regular 20%....
But, again never assume your cut!!"}
{"text":"We found this place through yelp. And I have to say, when we first arrived we were a bit surprised because of the strip center ambiance. Wow! Were we happy we stayed. The food was phenomenal and the service was perfect. The BYOB caught us off guard? But I walked next door and bought a bottle of wine and the corking fee was only 4.50. We had a party of six and all of the food was fantastic!! Definitely worth a trip and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! This is a small, authentic italian restaurant in an seamlessly unpretentious strip mall. We drove by it many times never realizing it was there till we found it on yelp and decided to visit.

Service was excellent. The eggplant parm was as good as what I ate in Italy and the East Coast. My husband loved the chicken parm.

During our 2nd visit it was for takeout. We ordered pizza (delicious sicilian style) and chicken wings (not recommended. Very small). 

I want to go back and try more on their menu!"}
{"text":"We tried out this place because of the positive Yelp ratings.  And who doesn't want to try out a new italian place?  It was packed on Saturday night and for the life of me I didn't think this was the kind of place that required reservations.  Someone had told me it was a little, family owned hole-in-the-wall that served good italian food.  So we had to wait for a table for about 15 minutes--not too bad.  It took a while to order because the place was really packed but we were quite patient.  Ordered chicken parm with angel hair plus one combination chicken & eggplant with rigatoni.  The server told us it would be a while so we were ready for a wait. 
We were provided a basket with two small rolls and butter.  They were really, really crispy & delicious.  ( I overheard someone at another table saying that they make their own bread.)  We added olive oil to our dishes and dunked the rolls for a yummy experience.  We were hoping they would bring more since a previous reviewer said that they keep the bread and water coming but such was not the case.  We were too polite to ask for more and perhaps that was a mistake.  
While waiting we noticed that people bring their own wines and get charged a small corkage fee.  Good idea.  Maybe next time.  We chit chatted and chit chatted anxiously awaiting our food.  Plates came and went but not our dishes.  When the waitress said it would take a while, she wasn't kidding.  Alas, after one hour, (yes, one hour) our food arrived looking mighty beautiful.  (too bad I didn't take a photo).  A mound of chicken with sauce and cheese alongside some beautiful looking pasta.  Tasted the pasta first to try the sauce and it was great---not too sweet and not too vinegary--a nice fresh taste especially with the freshly chopped parsley on it.  The chicken was thicker than most as it was not really a cutlet, but it was perfectly cooked with a crunchy outer crust.  I was happy.  Hubby was enjoying his as well and after such a long wait I was really relieved that he was loving his food.  However, there is one issue that I have to bring up despite the loveliness of the food.  Keep in mind that this is a small place with an open kitchen.  Diners are literally a few feet away from the kitchen operation.  The clanging of the clean dishes being stacked,  the dropping of large utensils and the throwing of pots when cooks are not happy with each other is NOT a good thing.  They have to figure out how to disagree in the kitchen without throwing pots and without certain words being used.  We are very upbeat and flexible people, but it got to the point where we couldn't really enjoy the meal because of the excessive kitchen noise.  I'm not talking about diners having a good time who get louder and louder the more wine they drink.  No, no.  People enjoying their food and wine is to be expected.  But what should be contained is the kitchen noise.  There has to be a way of placing dishes whereby you don't feel that every dish in the place has crashed to the floor.  
Figure it out guys.  Have your differences after the customers leave 'cause we really loved your food and want to come back.  
Looking forward to our next meal with you with just a little less noise.  
Thanks."}
{"text":"Phenomenol about sums it up. Everything fresh and homemade. The bread by itself could be a stand alone business. In addition to the amazing food it was a great value. $20 for two to eat lunch in Scottsdale is unheard of let alone for the quality of food we got. A year from now this place will be looking to move to a bigger restaurant!"}
{"text":"It is great to have a local restaurant that is not a chain. All four of us enjoyed our meals immensely. I would highly recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"Tonight, I needed a calzone. After consulting my handy-dandy Yelp app, I was down to two nearby options: NYPD and Basil & Garlic Bistro. Since I've never been to Basil & Garlic, since it was very highly reviewed by other Yelpers I've learned to trust, and since it has two of my very favorite ingredients right in its name, my conclusion was an obvious one.

Turns out, Basil & Garlic Bistro is less than two miles from where I live, so the trip was unexpectedly short and memorable. The storefront itself is unassuming and, unless you're specifically on the hunt for it, very easy to miss. I've driven by the plaza it's situated in dozens of times before without noticing its existence. (I'll need to level up my observation skillz...)

Upon entering, I was immediately greeted and invited to sit anywhere. Looking around the small dining area, I realized I was the only one there. (It was a little after 3:30p on a Saturday afternoon - an admittedly inconspicuous in-between time.) I was very ok with being alone to experience this lovely bistro for the very first time.

My server's name was Ruth. She was a wonderfully sweet and polite girl with a pleasing sense of calm humor about her. I felt instantly at ease. Ruth was excited to tell me about the Chef's Choices for the night, rattling off an impressive and detailed list of three distinct (and delicious-sounding!) pasta options - enough to make any mouth drool from anticipation.

I remained stalwart in my plans to consume a calzone, however, and ordered mine with pepperoni in place of the usual ham, as well as an addition of house garlic. The calzone and stromboli both come in \"small\" and \"large\" sizes, but Ruth assured me that the \"small\" calzone would, in fact, be quite large, and likely more than enough food for me.

Taking her advice, I ordered the \"small\". Not long afterward, the food was served and Ruth was NOT kidding. The \"small\" calzone here is easily comparable to the \"large\" calzone at NYPD, if not just a smidge bigger. It also comes with a good-sized tub of house-made marinara, which is something I always look for, because I like to use a lot.

Judging simply from the smell of the calzone, I knew it was going to be delicious, and I was not the least bit disappointed. Very honestly, the Basil & Garlic Bistro calzone was one of the very best I've ever eaten. Not only that, I had nearly half left over to take home after eating my fill. Asking for a box, Ruth was quick to bring one and even boxed everything up for me!

When I gathered my things to leave, both Ruth and her coworker were on the phone taking orders, so I wasn't able to wave goodbye as I would have liked, but one of the chef's caught me leaving from all the way back in the kitchen and made a point of calling out a heartfelt, \"Thank you - have a good night!\" Such a small thing... But it actually meant a lot to me.

CONCLUSION

For a quiet, somewhat lonely, winter night, I could not have been any happier with my visit to Basil & Garlic Bistro. The setting is intimate and warm, the service was BEYOND exceptional, the food was spectacular, portions were significantly larger than expected, and prices were more than fair.

If you've never been to Basil & Garlic Bistro before, bookmark it! Make an excuse to come experience some wonderfully authentic Italian fare in a truly homestyle setting and be sure to tip well - the staff deserves it, many times over. If you're bringing a larger group, I'd recommend calling ahead for reservations since space is somewhat limited.

A NOTE TO THE HOSTS

Basil & Garlic Team - THANK you for working so hard to provide such an inviting atmosphere. Ruth, thank YOU for being my friend for the night. Mr. Chef, thank you for catching me on my way out. You all made me feel right at home, and I couldn't be more pleased, or more grateful. Keep up the good work, and I'll do whatever I can to send more hungry folks your way!"}
{"text":"This family owned business is my go to recommendation for anyone in the area. The pizza is absolutely delicious, and you can taste the freshness in each bite.

Today, we treated our selves to a half Basil & Garlic Pesto Pizza w/ half Diavola. I knew I was going to be in for a treat when I tried one of the peppers and bit into them. It was super moist, nicely grilled, and simply delicious. This is before I even dove into the pizza, and I was already happy."}
{"text":"Best family owned place!! The most amazing pizza my husband and I have had. Will be back many times"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner with some good friends last night. We had the sauté calamari   appetizer with lemon and capers Yum! And finished it off with a large vegetarian pizza :-)
The toppings were so fresh,tender and tasty. I can't wait to go there again. Almost forgot. I am not a cannoli expert but it was the best  I've ever tasted, and I also recommend the spumoni, both are awesome! Thanks  Chef Claudio!"}
{"text":"Today we moved from beautiful San Diego to Scottsdale to live near our children. My husband found this gen of an Italian restaurant near our home. Our waitress Shannon was the best. Great customer service. The pizza was excellent. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Thank you yet again Yelp for helping us find another hidden gem...  Definitely wouldn't have just stumbled upon this place.  This isn't your typical overpriced Scottsdale chain garbago restaurant... instead it is a casual, no-frills, family owned place that makes quality food- Quite a refreshing surprise that you would imagine to find in Little Italy in San Diego or LA.  Enough of my ramblings... Overall - Great tasting food at an even better price!"}
{"text":"Amazing place at reasonable prices. Everything we have tried there is OUTSTANDING.  Love it so much that it has become a regular."}
{"text":"My Chicken Parm sandwich was great -- tasty sauce and lots of cheese.  The bread was delicious and tasted fresh/hot out of the oven.  I loved the family-run atmosphere.  The owners are very nice.  I'd definitly go back."}
{"text":"Scottsdale has a ton of fancy restaurants (which I don't mind) but we were looking for something more \"local\" and stumbled upon Basil & Garlic Bistro thanks to our handy Yelp app.  To get to this one year old restaurant, we came off E Cactus Rd, and we had to drive right into the residential neighborhoods. Once we saw the small plaza where Basil & Garlic Bistro was located, we said to each other that there was no way we would have found this place just by driving by because you just don't \"drive by\" the area where Basil & Garlic Bistro was located.

Onto the food. it was all amazing.  The chicken steak deluxe has a wonderful mixture of meat, veggies, and cheese.  There was a HUGE chunk of pepperoni in each half of the sandwich and my fiancee commented that \"this is the amount of pepperoni some places put on an entire pizza!\"  My fiancee's Vongole pasta with red sauce and clams was one of the better pasta dishes we've ever had, anywhere. And it was only $14, definitely a great deal because you're at a family owned establishment in a local neighborhood.  We finished off the meal with homemade tiramisu which was not overly sweet and did not have an overdosing of rum.  It was decorated with drizzles of chocolate sauce and cocoa powder with bits of whip cream on the side.

I come to Phoenix every so often for work and would definitely count Basil & Garlic Bistro as the place I'd try to come out to for dinner when my schedule allows me to make the drive out there."}
{"text":"How long have we lived in the area and never knew about this place?  Nice patio. The evening special was excellent. Pizza was also very good. Brought our own bottle of wine. Minimal corkage fee. We will be back and we don't say that often."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza slices for lunch.  Super nice husband and wife owners.  Bring your own wine and dine on the new patio.  Will be going for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Tucked away in a small shopping center and it's byob which is a nice perk!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I went to try the place 
Salad and breadsticks was ok 

Then came the dinner 
Let's just say it tasted frozen out of a jar 

We took one bite and told our waitress 

She came back and said that they wouldn't take the money off our receipt 

We had a bogne pasta and Marsala 

Then we asked for the owner and the rude manager came out and said he was out of town 

Then she accused us of eating half of it and we didn't 

Finally after waiting an hour for our receipt 

They end up adding a 20% charge to the bill 


Do  not EVER go there 

Worst service 
Rude manager."}
{"text":"I checked this place out based on reviews online. Did not disappoint...tremendous flavor from the first bite; the calzone with sausage, peppers and onions was magnificent. The pizza gets rave reviews. Crust just right - not too doughy, not too thin. Also the special of the day; sausage, tomato, white wine, lavender, peas and marinara over pasta. The bread was a little disappointing after reading rave reviews.  But the crusts on the pie and calzones were home runs.  Claudio, the owner, (Born in Palermo, raised in Bensonhurst) was hands on (literally, coming out to serve pizza at one point). This is a place that should not be missed.  That coming from a New Yorker who takes food seriously (especially pizza!). Bravo, Claudio! BYOB for a small charge."}
{"text":"It's a good place for a pizza, the ambience is informal but in my opinion, it gets a bit noisy as the seating is cramped, it can be worked upon, the mushroom fritters were bland and lacked seasoning, the eggplant parm had nothing going for it but the four cheese lasagne was good, the pizza is generous..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dropped in for lunch. We were seated immediately. Placed order soon after. We waited minimum of 45 min for a medium size pizza, and although food was prepared from scratch 45 minutes is a long time to wait. After the food was delivered no one came out to refill our waters or check on how everything was going. We had to go inside and look for someone to close out our tab. Overall not the lunch we expected. We live in the neighborhood and if we consider returning to dine at this restaurant once again we hope to have a better experience."}
{"text":"Very small and quaint little place that is tucked away in a very small little strip mall next to a convenient store. So glad we found this place. Great food and service. You can bring your own wine (which I will do next time). I you are up on near 92nd between Shea and Scottsdale check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  It is exactly what I look for when I want to eat out.  Wonderful family owned place!  We had the Stromboli.  The dough was light and baked to perfection.  The tomato sauce was just like my grandmother's sauce.  Lovely owners as well.  I am going back on Friday with more people so we can order pizzas!  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"the yelp online ordering system is a mess. orders not received and pricing outdated. however its a cute little italian restaurant, good is good, owner is a nice guy"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant reasonable prices with great food.  So glad we tried it out."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since moving to Arizona. We ordered take out and I only had 2 slices out of the whole box before my boyfriend ate it all. It was that good! Owners and staff are friendly so that's a plus too."}
{"text":"Nice mom and pop restaurant. Don't be deterred by the lackluster interior - the food is delicious. They have outside seating not necessarily for the view, (it's in a plaza tucked away in a residential area) but more to enjoy a nice outdoor meal."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood gem. We've taken lots of friends there and love sitting on patio on a nice evening. BYO is always fun. Reminds us of East Coast mom/pop places we love. Bruschetta is great, pasta with clam sauce, salad with shrimp, lasagna....  you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"A greatl local family owned restaurant. with delicious food.  It's intimate with tables inside and out. BYOB and bring some friends and have a wonderful evening.
  Make reservations to be sure you have a table.
  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"ordered take out from here today, and it was delicious! we had penne with Alfredo sauce and chicken.....kid approved! Penne ala vodka with chicken....delicious. The next time we are in the mood for italian, we are only going to come here!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the onion rings and pizza. Amazing pepperoni, ham, olives and peppers. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Not surprised the buzz has started about this place. I've been there twice already and the food is excellent.  Quiet location, neighborhood  feel, friendly and family owned. Afraid to post how yummy everything is because it will be too crowded next time we want to go. The only drawback of this place is that there aren't enough seats, and once word gets around about the homemade bread, robust stromboli, and delicious Bolognese sauce, the line will be out the door all the time."}
{"text":"Thursday night - The wait for our food was very unreasonable.  I was with family, otherwise I would have left.  An hour and a half later, my lukewarm food arrived.  I was extremely underwhelmed for it being a \"special\".  The shrimp was overcooked, the asparagus very soggy, the pasta stuck together in clumps, and a watery sauce.  My mother had a salad and another family member had chicken.  Cannot understand why it took so long when the restaurant was only 1/3 full.  I was expecting at least a little more based on all the reviews.

One word - \"meh\""}
{"text":"Service here was great - maybe they checked in on us too often ?  Is that possible ?  Pizza was great and plentiful .  Recommend the calzone - definitely too much for one person but great flavor. Chicken Parmesan was good but a little too much tomato - healthy size portion for sure. Prices in mid range .  Would definitely visit again.  Make sure to have reservations if going on a weekend ."}
{"text":"Best hole-in-the-wall restaurant in the city. There is just something about going to a family-run place like this versus a focus-grouped, corporate-style restaurant. Claudio, the Sicilian-born owner personally prepares nearly all the dishes himself. He delivers unbelievable, authentic Italian dishes in a warm and inviting atmosphere. The entire staff is tremendous, the food is reasonably priced, and it's BYOB, so you can save a ton by bringing your own bottle of wine. Can't think of enough superlatives about this place. I have brought several people over the years and not one has been blown away."}
{"text":"Excellent casual family restaurant off 92nd Street north of Shea -- if you blink you will miss the strip center they are located in -- hint -- look for the convenience store -- this restaurant is in the crotch of the retail center.  Fantastic food, my husband asked for something not on the menu and Claudio was sure to not disappoint.  I am very picky about chicken marsala and this was excellent with an abundance of mushrooms and delicious sauce.  The portions are extremely generous for the pricing.  Tiramisu was delish -- Nadine makes it, as was the cannoli - crunchy with delicious filling.  No complaints from us -- and we will be back.  We have finally found an Italian restaurant near our house that has the quality of food we enjoy.  I also like that you can bring your own wine for a $4.50 corkage fee -- that is a deal.  Everyone at the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their food and the hospitality from Claudio and Nadine -- great job guys - keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon we were looking for a place for a late lunch, and based on the Yelp reviews, we picked Basil & Garlic Bistro.  I've driven by the little strip center hundreds of times, and never given it a glance.  What a gem!!  Fantastic little italian bistro, we've been back virtually every weekend since!!

Claudio and Nadine and their staff are very friendly and welcoming.  After that first visit learning that they were BYOB, we bring a bottle of our favorite wine with us for a great little dinner out.  Love their Pizza (grabbed one to take home and watch the Super Bowl!!), their Stromboli's ... the Chicken Parm sandwhich ... were both fantastic.  We are working our way through their menu, really enjoyed the Pasta dishes I've tried too.  

Just reading through other reviews as well, and realizing that we weren't the first to stumble upon Basil & Garlic!  I agreed with all the positives I was reading in other reviews!  If you're in the area, don't hesitate!"}
{"text":"What a fun find.  Tucked into an unassuming little strip center in a neighborhood...took the chance and so glad.  Not a big place, but I felt like we got there before The Food Channel.  The vibe was fun, the staff all were having a great time and it made it entertaining for us.  All of the specials sounded amazing, but my eyes got stuck on Quattro Formaggio.  Oh wow.  I'll be working off those fat grams for weeks, but it was an amazing gourmet comfort melting in my mouth.  My date got penne with Bolognese and it was relish.  In fact, it would be good to split them and mingle the flavors.  You can just walk to the store a few steps down to purchase a bottle of wine as they don't serve, but will open and pour for you.  Oh, and both of us had a small garden salad with their house balsamic dressing.  Loved all the little piles of condiments on the sal"}
{"text":"I can't begin to explain in words the magic that comes out of their kitchen. I had a Stromboli and my wife had a chicken with pest sand which.  The food is amazing the two owners and very kind and clearly care about their customers. This is a small place with amazing food. If I could give 10 stars for food quality, taste, and service I would. 

Great job!!  They are going to need a bigger restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this little place. It served some of the best Italian I've ever had. BYOB too! I just buy some wi r from Convenience corner next door and enjoy my meal!!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service. I overheard the guy say they make their own bread, i thought it was very good. I had a steak and cheese - meats (they added pepperoni) were also good. Would definitely like to come back and try another menu item."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see this place have a five star rating on Yelp.  It must be the owners posting over and over again because there is no way it should be rated that highly.

We got takeout, thank God, because the interior of the restaurant reminded me of a 7-11.  No offense to the owners, but the dining area floor plan is a mess, complete with garbage bag table cloths and a massive Pepsi machine in the middle of the room.  

I ordered Chef Claudio's Favorite.  The sauce and pasta weren't bad but the ham was basically cold cuts you would get from  Safeway...not what you would expect from a 5 star Yelp restaurant for close to $20.  My wife ordered the Quattro Formaggi, very much overkill on the cheese and had a very chunky consistency and gritty texture.  

Again, I hate to bash a place but this is a 2 star restaurant and these 5 star reviews are absolute nonsens"}
{"text":"Back again, and maybe happier than after the first visit.  Great team, food and service.  Simply plan on eating outside on their well maintained, quiet patio.  Pizza is particularly good, bruschetta is great and fried mushrooms were very good."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I can't get over how amazing our experience at Basil & Garlic was! From the warm, friendly service to the incredible food, this place is a definite hidden gem in the Valley. If you live far away, trust me, it is worth the drive!! The best part, it is BYOW (Bring Your Own Wine). 

We ordered the bruschetta to start, it was incredible. I then had the side salad that was cold and crisp with fresh ingredients. Their creamy Italian dressing is a must! For my entree, I ordered the Chicken Marsala and added artichoke hearts (because I couldn't decide which pasta dish to get and I LOVE artichoke hearts!). Not only was the portion size HUGE, but it was SO delicious. I was going to take half of it home but I ended up eating it all because I couldn't stop! 

Believe it or not, I saved a tiny bit of room for their homemade tiramisu (the owner's wife's recipe) and holy heaven, my 'only one bite' turned into 5! Yum Yum! 

For the portion sizes and quality, the prices are extremely reasonable and you can taste the love in the food. We will for sure come back again soon. I want to try EVERYTHING on the menu!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place to eat! The food was so fresh and delicious! Everything tasted very homemade and fresh!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best pizza I have had in the greater Phoenix area.  

My wife and I went here a couple of nights ago after an event in the area.  We had a very friendly and attentive waitress take care of us.  When I asked for a wine menu, she informed me that I can buy a bottle at the liquor store next door and that she will charge a cork fee of 4.50!  This is WAY better than actually ordering a glass of wine...I bought a bottle of chianti for 11.00, so ended up with an entire bottle of wine for 15.50!  We took over half home.  

For the food, my wife and I first shared the fried mushroom appetizer -- delicious and huge portion, with a huge portion of marinara sauce as well.  We then shared a large pizza with a bunch of veggies.   The restaurant was EXTREMELY generous with the vegetables; we made a couple of substitutis at no charge, and the veggies were literally piled on like I have never seen,  We will definitely be back at some point..."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening here last night after sitting outside in our heated car for forty minutes. LOL

Well as you might known, it's been cool here in the valley lately. And, sitting outside for a table to free up wasn't an option. Which BTW, I believe sums up nicely our thoughts of Basil & Garlic. Who would wait forty minutes in the cold, for a table unless it was something special?

And special it was, owner Nadine came over and welcomed us.  She was sweet and warm, both to us and everyone in the restaurant. That was how the evening went and you can understand why so many people flock here. 

We started with a salad with a home made Italian dressing for only $1.50.  For dinner we ordered the Chicken Parmesan with Angel Hair for $15.95 (photo) with a side of Sausage ($2.85). The cutlets were huge and very flavorful. We also ordered the Lasagna for only $13.95. It too was huge and meal for two. 

I cannot convey how wonderful the evening was and how pleased we were with the food and the warmth of our host.  The food was Four Stars plus and the value over Five Stars.  Our bill came to a very fair $36.75. 

Enjoy!  We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Am torn about giving this location only three stars but given the competition in the Scottsdale area for restaurants I think this one would only be 3 1/2 and I can't give it four.

We arrived at about 6:30 on Sunday night to find no one inside and only one table in the courtyard with patrons. It is in the inside corner of a tiny mall at Poinsettia Lane and 92nd with nothing but subdivisions all around. It seems like not many people know this place is here. They were doing a fair amount of carry out business however.

We sat inside only because they had the misters on in the courtyard and it was really getting too cold when we walked by. Inside however the ambience really lacks warmth. Perhaps they're trying to save money given the low amount of traffic they have but the lightbulbs in the 10 streetlamp looking fixtures are steely-bright fluorescent style and gave a really cold light to the room. Also although the table tops are wood the chairs and table legs are metal which adds to the cold unflattering appearance of the inside dining room. There were no table covers and the carryout register was in the middle of the room across from the door which gave it an extremely casual feel. The pictures of various cities in Italy on the wall and the streetlamp pictures themselves were cute as it appeared they were trying to make the dining room look like a courtyard in Italy. Unless you can sit outside this is not the kind of place you want to go to for a romantic dinner given their current lighting and table set up in the dining room.

We ordered fried calamari and the two specials of the day - chicken piccata and a baked creamy pasta with chicken, broccoli and bacon mixture topped with cheese.

The calamari were extremely crispy however they really lacked flavor. We squeezed lemon and added salt and it still didn't taste like enough so we added more salt and finally a third sprinkling of salt brought it close to where it needed to be. The marinara served with it was fine but nothing special.

The chicken piccata was very well-balanced with just enough garlic and lemon. Another reviewer or two mentioned that the pasta dishes were served with either too much sauce or too little pasta and I would have to agree for this dish as well. There were 2 pounded out thin pieces of chicken breast which didn't have any kind of browning from the sautéing process but the caper sauce was very good. There was a small amount of pasta on the plate and it did look funny - they either needed to serve less sauce or more pasta.

The baked pasta special with creamy chicken, broccoli and bacon was the bomb however. The top was bubbly and brown with plenty of cheese, the rigatoni were probably the wrong pasta to use as many of them dried out as they stuck out of the sauce. The chicken, broccoli, bacon and cream was very flavorful and not mixed well enough with some of the rigatoni so there were some dry pieces of rigatoni on the edges of the dish while the bottom of the dish was super creamy and flavorful.

The bread service had nicely salted butter, balsamic vinegar and olive oil options and two pieces of a dense triangle shaped bread. One of them was moist and the other one was definitely dried out and seemed like a leftover from yesterday.

Given the ambience and the couple of issues with the entrées I think the prices are just a tad bit too high. The entrées were delicious so if you want a fast, flavorful meal I would recommend it for that."}
{"text":"This little Italian bistro is an unassuming, tucked away gem. We went there after looking at the other reviews on yelp, and were not disappointed. My coworkers and I ordered the vegetarian sandwich, a calzone, the cheesy fries, and tiramisu.

First of all, the portions are VERY generous. The calzone, for the average person, would be enough for 3 meals. I was with a 20-something man who never has an issue clearing his plate. Well, this time he did. 

The fries were covered in what was the tastiest, garlic-infused mozzarella. It is also a big helping. The vegetarian sandwich came on beautiful bread and was overflowing with marinated and cooked veggies, topped off with that delightful mozzarella again. 

Then there is the calzone. We ordered a vegetarian calzone (made to our specifications). I already mentioned the size (epic!), but the flavors involved are a beautiful combination. Many times, a calzone is pretty straightforward. Cheese, sauce, other fillings, etc. This was such an intricate pallet of flavors, it's clear a lot of thought, and skill, went into its creation. 
Last, but certainly not least, was the tiramisu. It's a big piece, creamy, great flavors-none of which overwhelm the others. 

Seriously, this place is great. The owners, Claudio and Nadine, are charming and welcoming (Claudio is the Sicilian chef, and talks to customers while bustling around in the kitchen). Make sure to not be in a big hurry, because this quality (and quantity) of food can't be rushed. The prices are very reasonable, and it was an overall delightful experience. We plan on going back very soon!"}
{"text":"The food was great. It was strikingly fresh. As if the were pounding out the tomatoes just before we arrived to make the sauce. The only thing is location they are so far off the beaten path you have to be a, not only local but neighborhood local (or yelper) to know about this place. Now that I think about it that is the only reason I haven't been back. Fixing that soon, soon..."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Veal Saltimbocca, Veal Limone, and Pasta Boscaiola were what we ordered. The deserts cannoli and tiramisu were very good as well. The service was excellent and the owners treat you like family. Don't miss out on this cute neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall restaurant!! Take your bottle of wine with you!  If you forget to bring your own wine, their is a little shop in the center to buy a bottle. Great neighborhood spot!! Their portions are very generous and sit outside on the patio and enjoy this cooler weather!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Basil & Garlic based on yelp reviews. We have lived in north Scottsdale for a year and a half and have found most of the local food not worth going out for, so we usually go to Old town or Phoenix for good food. Our first clue that the food would be good was the aroma when we opened the door. it smelled like South Philly or  Little Italy in NY. The food was delicious. The garlic bread had a subtle garlic flavor, and nice crunch, Perfect with the garlic basil pesto shrimp and pasta. Being from the east we couldn't resist trying a calzone. The  dough was firm but not heavy and soft but not soggy. the  sauce was tasty without being too strong for the ricotta filling. Will  definitely go  back. BYOB is great for a casual place ."}
{"text":"Claudio and Nadine, we want to thank you for such a pleasant meal last evening. The Chicken Cacciatore and the Chicken Marsala were outstanding. I enjoyed being able to watch Claudio work his magic in the kitchen. The aroma's coming our way were outstanding. We will be back and we will be bringing our friends.

{"text":"Having grown up on Long Island and having lived in New York City, I know my pizza. And by pizza I mean New York style pizza. Basil and Garlic Bistro is the closest thing I've had to New York pizza. I wonder if they import the water for the dough? It is seriously good. The bottom is crispy and not burnt.  And the place has an air of authenticity in that the owners are bonafide New Yorkers, complete with Brooklyn accents. The ambience is ok, it's a little dark and cramped but there is something so New York about that too. Go and experience the cheesy deliciousness."}
{"text":"The recommendation and reviews were rather misleading. The food and service was ok, the atmosphere terrible. We could hardly talk without everyone hearing every word and the \"chef\" staring at us. Very small, dirty looking, fluorescent lighting but not all worked and silverware impossible to cut the pizza, had to ask them to cut smaller slices. Also would have loved a glass of wine, they don't serve alcohol. Plenty of better places in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! The calzones are super great! The antipasto salad is fantastic, went with 2 other couples for Friday night dinner & all 4 loved it wanting to come back on and share great food & BYOB!! I have had the food at least 10 - 11 times always excellent. Love is a place you wine lovers can bring your own wine to!!!! BYOB Corkage is 4.50 very very cheap, super to bring your own wine for 4 1/2 bucks and not pay those ridiculously priced wines at other place for cruddy wine! The homemade crusts, the homemade items to order that are priced very reasonable too! Had Clams & mussels dish was of the hook! Patio outside perfect in good weather tables all have linen tablecloths not usually at places this reasonable priced! Great owners Claudio & Nadine on the premises have built a fantastic local little hangout for traditional Italian dishes and pizza for lunch or dinner!
I enjoy the BYOB & the bargain prices for excellent food with wonderful owners!! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great! Super laid-back and excellent food! The staff was wonderful! The Sicilian pizza is awesome - and huge."}

{"text":"My mom found this place and it is a hidden gem!  We went for dinner with my two year old and everything was amazing.  My mom and I split the grilled chicken salad and between the two of us we couldn't finish it.

Everyone that works there is really friendly and we have already been back for round two!"}

{"text":"A quaint restaurant and great place to take a friend from out of town. Good Italian food. The waitress wasn't as attentive as I'd like, but overall the experience was great. Good Italian food. 
They do not serve liquor/wine/beer, but if you bring your own or purchase it from the convenient store next door, they'll charge you a corking fee and you can drink."}
{"text":"Just found this place, just in a residential neighborhood.  For some reason I really felt like a meatball sub today, so I searched Yelp for \"best meatball sub\" and b&g showed up. The 5 star reviews are not a mistake.  I got a hot meatball Parmesan Sub for me and my wife, we both loved it and want to go there for dinner this weekend."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great family place to eat. Wonderful owners. Will be going every spring training and when we come visit family!"}
{"text":"Meatball sub was delicious, as well as calzone oozing with cheese and wonderful dipping sauce! So affordable, excellent value!"}
{"text":"We went to Basil & Garlic for lunch.  We heard about this place through a friend.  It turned out to be a great recommendation.  The only bad place and I feel bad for the owners is the location.  They are hidden in the corner of a strip mall in a neighborhood.  That being said, you need to seek this place out.  Very good service, the owners are very kind and thoughtful.  The bread served with your salad is fresh baked and ohhhhh sooooo good!!  The sausage parm with added onions and peppers were very good!

The chefs special is light, fresh and also very good.  I would have added more mushrooms, peppers and onions with the dish.  Lat lunch is the best time to go.  If you go during dinner, especially on  a Friday,expect a decent wait as there is not enough staff to handle the crowd.

Overall, still worth a look!"}
{"text":"Amazing little find in the middle of the neighborhood. I was having a rough day and was stranded with vehicle troubles. Decided to go eat while I wait and found Basil & Garlic Bistro. This is a truly authentic Italian restaurant with great food that was so fresh.  Must make a  trip back here."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite locally owned restaurants in north Scottsdale. Every dish we've ordered there is outstanding. My favorite is the chef's pasta.  And another good thing is that you can bring in your own alcohol for a cork fee.  Reservations are a must due to the small size of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of checking out this place yesterday. It's a small little family run place tucked in the corner of a small strip mall. When you walk in you are greeted by the 2 owners who run the place and seem to do all the cooking. They know what they're doing.

We ordered the b&g special sandwich which is baked chicken, roasted red peppers, fresh mozzarella, and pesto. Awesome flavor. I'm craving it right now just thinking about it.

We also ordered a slice of cheese pizza for my little guy. It's was his first time having pizza and he loved it. I loved it as well because I got the leftovers.

My wife ordered a \"personal\" pizza. It was more than enough for 1 person. She added artichokes, broccoli, and eggplant. The eggplant was strips of fried deliciousness. I'm a carnivore but I loved it. The wife was very impressed.

All in all this place is great. Non-assuming family run place with amazing food. The pizza is as good as any pizza I have ever had. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just finished my second time at this restaurant.  I had to change my rating from 5 stars to 4, for a few reasons.  I had previously visited and sat on the patio and had a great experience and have really been anxious to return.

This place has great reviews but there are a couple things that deserve noting.  First and foremost, the food is very, very good which is obviously the most important thing and why I still feel they deserve 4 stars.  However, we waited a long time for bread that was hard with cold butter and no knives to spread it with.  We were absolutely starving and so we devoured it anyway.  I did not know it was BYOB-I'll have to note that for if I return.  We had to sit inside as it was extremely busy.  The inside is bustling with activity.  It does remind me of a little trattoria you might come upon in Italy.  But the staff is a little too casual-we heard more than a few curse words coming from the kitchen (with small children in tow).  Also our waitress came in from the patio and was loudly telling the chef about a customer who was complaining about the way her chicken was cooked and they all proceeded to roll their eyes and bad mouth the customer, in front of us who were dining.  That is completely inappropriate.  We also had to ask for water numerous times.  And the bathroom hadn't been taken care of, lacking paper towels and what not.
As mentioned, the food is great but at this price point I feel they could improve on a few things.  I think they may have been understaffed but the paying customers shouldn't have to suffer by not having appropriate silverware and having to ask repeatedly for water.  I guarantee that wouldn't happen in Italy!

The bottom line is the last time I dined here I wished I lived closer so I could be a regular, and this time leaves me wondering if I will come back."}
{"text":"excellent food and I love you can bring your own alcohol! I bought some wine next door and the food was outstanding.  Small little place but so good.  Will go back again!!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant with big flavors and highly recommended to everyone looking for classic pizza, calzones, stromboli's, sub's or Italian favorites from an east coast style pizzaria. The owners are extremely engaging, husband is from Palermo, Sicily, Italy (probably the capital when it comes to Italian pizza makers in America and his beautiful wife is from Germany---should be interesting this summer for the World Cup). They check a few times with customers to ensure quality and complete satisfaction while dining. Once you try their food you'll probably quickly become a regular, as I recently did.

They offer house made bread that is unique, served for meals and used for the sandwiches offered. The pizza dough is expertly prepared and cooked to a nice crispness, the pizza sauce is not sweet like you find at many other local pizza establishments and the mozzarella cheese is the highest quality that melts perfectly on your pizza and sandwiches.

The Bistro is a little hard to find but located in a small strip shopping center off 92nd street between Shea and Cactus (formerly 2 Men and a Pizza). If you don't live nearby, it's well worth the trip from anywhere in the Scottsdale area if you're looking for the pizzaria you remember from anywhere east of the Mississippi. 

I have not tried the entrees yet but they do offer quite a few on the menu and have seen numerous satisfied customers. I hope you get by to meet the new owners soon. Please remember, this is a BYOB establishment that does not serve alcohol.

Enjoy, DeLaurentis"}
{"text":"Woooow! It's like I was in a real Sicilian kitchen. Don't get fooled by the strip mall setting and the simple decor, the food is delicious! Best Italian o have ever had. The ingredients are so much better too-- it's not all the grease like at some places. It's just deeelicious. Family owned as well which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Bring your own wine here. Call ahead for larger groups .
Delicious meatballs and pasta. This is a tiny place that has a few tables and is cozy inside. If we had known be could bring our own wine we would have, apparently almost everybody else knew to BYOB. I had a  chicken garlic bruschetta  that was tasty but had too much bread. Fresh and delicious. We will visit again!"}
{"text":"I am a self proclaimed foodie and I don't mess around when it comes to food. Basil and Garlic Bistro is the real deal. I have been here three times and have ordered three different dishes, all were fantastic. 

The first time I was here I ordered the meatball sandwich and it was so flavorful, lightly toasted on the outside, the meatballs were perfectly seasoned, the cheese was flavorful and of great quality. I was so full after eating the first half that I saved the other half for dinner. I didn't want to ruin the delicious sandwich by reheating it in the microwave so I turned on the oven and patiently waited to once again experience the intoxicating scent of an almost fresh meatball sandwich. It was just as good as the first bite!"}
{"text":"I've had a half dozen sandwiches from Basil and Garlic as well as a couple of meals and have been satisfied with all of them.  The bread and rolls are homemade and very good.  In short, you get a real sandwich; the portions are great, if you order a chicken parm. sandwich there's plenty of chicken, it's more than enough for a full meal.

That being said they need to go onto grubhub and update their site.  All of the prices on grubhub have not been updated and are approximately two to three dollars lower than the actual price.  They show a meatball sub for $6.99 on grubhub when the actual price is $8.99.  Not a major issue but simply not good business to keep the actual pricing on websites up to date.  

This is not the type of restaurant you go to for the ambience.  The decorating is marginal at best, it's your basic run of the mill setting with generic tables and chairs and harsh lighting.  The food I would describe as slightly above average but still in need of fine tuning.  It's a husband and wife setup and on any given day you can find the parents and kids having a meal before the evening starts and patrons arrive.

If your looking for a casual meal that doesn't disappoint you're in luck; if you're out to impress a date and looking for a romantic setting you've made the wrong choice."}
{"text":"Solid! Saw the reviews and it was close to where we were staying. Busy as can be so reservations are needed to streamline but a small local place which represents quality. Service was good as well!!!"}
{"text":"A true find. As a transplanted New Yorker, I have to say this is the best Italian Food this side of the Hudson. Yes, can be a tad slow when busy but worth the wait! I hope it stays this way.... a hidden BYOB worth every calorie!"}
{"text":"What a great little find. We split a penne vodka & meatball sub. Both delicious. Super friendly service & cute little spot. Tiramisu was on point!!"}
{"text":"Omg, omg, omg. If you are from the east coast like I am, you will understand all the omg's. East coasters are always on the eternal search for food that is \"just like home\".  I am from NY and so are the owners of Basil and Garlic Bistro. There was an immediate connection. To say the food was \"just like home\" is an understatement. Fugettabouit. 

Now don't go in expecting anything fancy. This is a tiny little joint pizzeria style. Just a few tables with extremely minimal decor. In my opinion, that is part of the charm. No airs about so the food needs to stand on its own. I had the linguine and clams and it is just like I used to get in queens. Just right. My mother had the chicken parm dinner, which is not actually on the menu but they advised me that most heros (sandwiches for people who don't speak NY) can be made into dinners. To say it was excellent is also an understatement. Dad had the meatball hero which was perfection and we took pizzas home which are exactly what we are used and long for. All heros are served on their delicious bread which is also given to the table when you first sit. Amazing.  For dessert we ordered the cannolis as you can't fully judge a place without having their cannolis. Did I say OMG? Oh yeah, I did. 

I can't wait to come back to Basil and Garlic Bistro. I will be dreaming about it until then."}
{"text":"I took some friends to Basil and Garlic for dinner because someone had given me a recommendation. To our surprise the dinner menu was incomplete. That is to say that there were limited offerings. For one thing, we were not able to get a sandwich. Our only choices were dinner or a salad. One of the main disapointments was the pricing. The restarunt does not warrant such high pricing. We go to Magiano's and get get surroundings and the pricing is a lot less. The food was good, but the pricing need to come down quite a bit for us to even consider going back. I felt bad recommending we go there for dinner. Usually price is not a problem, but we do like a nice atmosphere if we are paying so much. Not even table cloths."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a small strip, a small neighborhood place which has reliable good food. It's byob and the service and prices are good, nice patio also. Been here a few times, never disappointed. Last night I had the chicken parm. Large, great sauce and very tasty. Everyone enjoyed their food. Not hip, low key, and always good."}
{"text":"I simply never leave five stars, but that doesn't mean four is best. It's just rare to get a five

Bottom line: cozy local Italian joint for local regulars. They make most of their own ingredients, it tastes good, and is reasonably priced...if you can overcome some weird interactions which may not be common

Okay, look, this place weirded me out right from the get go, but I had a positive overall food experience. So, I'm no stranger at all to local Italian joints. I went to Dominicks pizza in Glendale for 20 years till they shut down, and they knew my family by name--so I totally get the hometown family-run restaurant vibe 100%. That being said...

The moment I walk in, this kid (who really needs to shave) greets me and says \"how can I help you today\"? I responded that I don't usually get greeted with something like that when I come to a restaurant. Usually the greeter asks, 'table for 2', or 'where do you prefer to be seated'? He said that they get a lot of to go orders, that's why he asked. So then he told me I could sit anywhere, and I sat at a table. 

Then came weird interaction #2. He comes up to my table and informs me that they don't have alcohol here, but if I wanted to, I could \"go to the corner, get a drink (alcoholic), and bring it back here\". I shitchu not! So I'm thinking to myself, I just sat down, and now you're offering me to leave, buy something somewhere else, and then come back here with that product? Dude, are you kidding me? Look, this guy is terrible as a greeter, otherwise he must have taken one look at me and decided to get weird for other reasons (as in I don't fit the profile of their regulars and he wants me gone--but I prefer not to take that interpretation). These two interactions alone should be enough for me not to come back. But wait, there's more

Less than a minute after that weirdness, a lady with glasses comes up to tell me about the two daily specials. The thing is, the entire time, she gave me an intent stare, without blinking. Doesn't seem weird? Be on the receiving end of it and you'll know what I'm talking about. Then she got weirdly defensive when I simply told her I didn't want the menu anymore after I ordered. She asked if I wanted to keep the menu, and I literally just said no, and she gave some strange but defensive reply

But you know what, the people and service aren't primary to me. They may be to others, but the food always comes first and foremost in my experience. If there's good food, I'm willing to endure weirdness (after all, we're all a little weird, aren't we?) in order to come get it. So keep that in mind when you read my stuff

So I ordered the lasagna, and I gotta say, it was pretty good. 
The pasta was al-dente, the bolognese wasn't too sour or acidic (I'm very sensitive to that), and the ground beef tasted good. It was also hot. Believe it or not, I've gotten cold lasagna in the past, and it tastes terrible. They don't make their own ricotta, but what they put in there tasted good, and so did the mozzarella to top it off. All in all it was a good, warm, flavorful lasagna. 

I will also give some UPs to the home-baked dinner rolls which were light, fluffy, tasty, and when buttered/oiled/vinegared-up, were a winning combination.

My total bill was around $20 for a coke and a lasagna with dinner rolls. Fair price

When you go to an Italian joint, there are two dishes you need to eat in order to establish if this is the kind of place you're going to return to or pass on: 1. lasagna; 2. chicken parm. This place passes test #1, so despite the weirdness, I will return some day in the future and give them another shot"}
{"text":"I was looking for a sandwich for lunch in the area and stopped here after finding it listed on Yelp. I'm so glad I did. The owners are a husband and wife and are very nice. I ordered the Florentine sandwich (chicken, spinach, garlic, and provolone cheese). It was huge and delicious (I'm saving half for later, it was so big). Now I have to come back here sometime for pizza because the bread my sandwich was on was SO-O good. I can hardly wait to check out that pizza crust! Authentic Sicilian food--you can't beat that :)"}
{"text":"I am beginning to see a trend here.  First Pesto Prima Café.  Now this.  If Yelper Max A says it is a 5-star restaurant, then a 5-star restaurant it is! 

And B&G Bistro's food is exactly that.  The wonderful smells greet you at the door. Add to that a very hard working, charming young couple, Claudio and Nadine, who are at the helm, and frankly, what's not to like?

Simply put...at the time of this writing, this place has barely been on the map more than 3 months.  It already has the whole neighborhood talking and supporting it.  I saw person after person come in, pick up their food, and tell the owners that they heard about them from somebody. They don't need to advertise but I shall Yelp regardless. I can already see longevity and expansion in their future.

Antipasto salad. Decorated with attractive rolls of excellent tasting meats and cheese. Add more shredded cheese and very crisp romaine. Top it with still warm, freshly grilled red bell pepper in olive oil. Then top it with his house balsamic dressing. Get it!

Then make sure you sop up the dressing with slices of his own freshly baked bread. And try not to roll your eyes into the back of your head while you moan in delight.

Chicken Marsala. Tender, generous, moist chicken breast, pounded then seared to perfection, then topped with copious amounts of sautéed mushrooms in a Marsala sauce. You get to name your pasta, Mr. B chose Angel hair.  An excellent choice.

Cheese Steak Deluxe. A sandwich that is destined for fame. Start with thinly sliced, tender beef and a touch of pepperoni, add well sautéed mushrooms, onions, some of those magnificent grilled red bell pepper slices, and some great melty cheese, then drop it and all its juices into one of his freshly baked Italian rolls.  Juicy, flavorful, huge. Wouldn't change a thing.

There is no pretense to his food. He cooks with simplicity. He cooks it fresh. He loves his customers and already knows them by name. There is a very special vibe here.

Plenty of left overs to revisit tonight's meal. And we will be back.  Maybe to try a pizza from his stone oven.

All I can say is, if you dropped everything and ran over here now, it will not be a moment too soon, and you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Pretty solid hole in the wall Italian place. As someone who does not eat Italian as much, I could not make a judgement regarding authenticity, however the place seemed inviting and the interior had a comfy feel to it. The food was served in satisfying portions, and quite tasty. I ordered the alla vodka which came with a basket of bread. As far as the bread goes, it was nothing fancy, however I was told that the bread was home made. I'm not sure how fresh the bread was, but it was mildly warm when served. It felt almost as if it was microwaved. The wait time for the food was not long, granted I went during after lunch hours and the food was presented nicely. My one complaint was that the pasta was very saucy which made it a bit soggy, however it was not too much an issue for me. As far as prices go, the pasta prices for more premium dishes were competitive with those at more well established Italian restaurants which, considering the causality of the place, felt a tad bit pricey for me. Overall, there was nothing outstandingly bad about the place or the food and the pros outweighed the cons. With friendly staff, a family run environment, prompt service and tasty food, it was an overall positive experience."}
{"text":"We arrived in Scottsdale this June from New York.  Coincidentally, the owners of Basil & Garlic Bistro - also from NY - had arrived here this Spring.  

Allow me to say this local Italian Bistro is \"pure heaven\" - fresh, clean, superb food, incredibly excellent Pizzas, marvelous congenial service AND the real deal.  Economical and excellent prices, great menu variety + Italian Food as it should be.

Lucky for us it's only a few mile drive and WE will be regulars.  Take note - there is only seating for 34 and at times, there will be a wait = well worth it!  Better yet, just drop in on a weeknight - as we did yesterday... no wait - just BIG smiles.

To date, in my first 3 months here, Basil & Garlic Bistro is the VERY BEST value I've found and I'm certain you'll be as equally pleased here!

{"text":"Quaint little neighborhood Italian restaurant - it felt like home to me.  The owners, Claudio and Nadine, are a delight.  Friendly and aim to please - I was so impressed by the fresh ingredients and they bake their own bread - I had the B&G special hot sub sandwich and was so impressed by the size of the bread - not overwhelmingly big - thin and just right.  And a lot of meat (chicken)  how nice to see the generous portion of meet to peppers to cheese - how many times do you go to an eatery and there's hardly any meat in the sandwiches. I also ordered the calamari. Came with lemon wedges and red sauce on the side. Exactly the way it's supposed to be served. The calamari was really good!  As soon as you sit down, they serve you with homemade bread and butter.  Don't fill up on it, but it's worth trying because it's really good too.
Complimenti Chef Claudia - it was so nice to meet you and Nadine and I know I'll be seeing you again soon!  Oh and I took a canoli home - can't wait to try it!"}

Byob! Can't wait to take advantage next time we go. 

Our table shared pizza, lasagna and Stromboli. Really excellent crust - and very generous portions.

{"text":"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!

My wife went here with some friends a few months ago. We live pretty far away so it took a while to stop by to try out the food for myself. My next trip will be MUCH sooner!

I had the Chef's special, my wife had the vongole. We brought our 7 month old son in, he tried pasta for his first time and loved it :) The Chefs special was so flavorful! All of the ingredients used seemed to be top notch. In the valley we are plagued with awful franchise restaurants, this is anything but! Top quality all around! Very well may be the best restaurant I have been to in my 5 years in the valley!

The menu has something for everybody. My wife loves seafood, I do not! There were plenty of options for her and plenty of options for me. They have the 'classic' pasta dishes like Spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna etc. and pizza so it's great for kids too!

The owners were running the restaurant when we went in and were very nice and charming. It's easy to see why the restaurant is so highly rated. Amazing food, great, friendly service and a charming setting."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and bookmarked it right away, I was very excited to try this place out today! As a vegetarian and a fairly healthy eater, pizza is my guiltiest food pleasure. I know my pizza..and the pizza here is absolutely delicious.

This is definitely a hole in the wall type place, kind of oddly placed in a neighborhood. The restaurant is very tiny, as other reviews said, nothing fancy decor-wise. My boyfriend and I were the only two people at the restaurant, but we went at a weird time.  The two people working there were very kind and welcoming to us, I was happy with the service. 

I had a hard time deciding what to order because the menu is massive, I will have to come back and try out the eggplant parmesan sandwich. I followed my pizza-loving gut and went for the individual size cheese pizza and added tomatoes as a topping. Beware: the individual size is huge. I usually eat a ton, and I wasn't even able to get through half of this pizza. One great thing is that they make their own dough for the pizza and bread. The crust was incredible. My meal tasted very authentic, this is up there with some of the best pizza I have enjoyed in the state of Arizona. 

The price is great too, got a ton of food for a very low price. Was probably the least expensive sit-down meal my boyfriend and I have ever enjoyed together. We very rarely go to the same restaurant twice, but we are certainly adding this place to our very short list of restaurants to revisit!"}
{"text":"Was taken here for my birthday and was our first time in. Couldn't have been more disappointed in almost everything. While true it is a small place they had a table of about 8 which seemed to overwhelm the staff although our server, Ruth, did an admirable job.

We started with the $10 Calamari appetizer. Took awhile and when it came out it was tasteless and rubbery. Our server apologized and graciously offered to replace it. An offer we accepted. Second time, no better and we weren't charged.

Then we shared a small dinner salad which was nice enough although when they say small, they mean it. Served on a small side plate. Was tasty enough but hey, it's assembly and not cooking. Bread and butter were served with the salad. It was nothing special but ok. Hard to believe the bread was made in house as claimed.

Then best of all I ordered the Chef's signature dish, Chef Claudio's Favorite: Sautéed Fresh Mushrooms, Ham, Red Onions and Peas delicately simmered in a rosa cream sauce, baked in an oven with mozzarella cheese. $16.95

Chef's signature dish should be done right shouldn't it? And if you are truly a trained chef specializing in Italian cuisine you wouldn't use ham would you? Or if you DID use ham it wouldn't taste like it was cheap lunchmeat ham would it? It would be some sort of Italian ham like a prosciutto or maybe a capocolla wouldn't it? Nope, just plain old cheap tasting lunchmeat ham.

So mediocre to poor food and a very, very noise kitchen make for a poor meal which we won't attempt to repeat."}

Pretty solid traditional Italian eatery!

I came with my family on a quiet night.  We started out with breadsticks, onion rings, and some calamari.  Pretty much your typical appetizers, but what really popped for me was the marinara sauce that came with it.  It was thick, sweet, and had a strong tomato base.  We all shared the Basil & Garlic Pizza with sausage.  The crust was warm and doughy while topped with  mozzarella, sundried tomatoes, parmesan cheese, and pesto sauce.  I'm not a fan of pesto sauce on my pizza, but overall it was a subtle bite and very cheesy for sure.  

Since this is an Italian restaurant; I ordered an entree too!  I went for the Bolognese with linguine pasta.  I love the meaty sauce coming out piping hot as I can see the steam.  The sauce was sweet and robust.  I wish the pasta was handmade, but I understand not everyone has time for it.  

In the end, service was solid and on point.  The place is tiny and has a cute homey allure to it.  The place is kind of off the map from what I can gather, but if you need a quite home cooked bite; this is your spot! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere and delightful owners make for a great place to eat.

We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

Just stopped in to try a new place and we were very impressed! Adorable outdoor eating area, live music and great service was just the beginning! 

A large selection of Italian dishes, both traditional and new takes. We were even told they will make anything you want if they have the ingredients!

Everything is made fresh and on property with the exception of very few items. For example; mozzarella sticks, French fries, etc. 

Our food was incredible!! The Alfredo sauce was especially addicting... I ordered the Lasagna (which was amazing) but I finished with the Alfredo because I couldn't stay away!!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!

I came here for lunch the other day and enjoyed their food so much.

It's tucked away at the small strip mall in the middle of residential area. The decor inside is questionable with some pictures from all over Italy, so inconsistent, I wasn't sure which region's Italy they were from...

I ordered pizza with pesto sauce. First bite of pizza, I couldn't believe what I just ate, pleasantly surprised. Turned around to look at the person in the kitchen, and all I could say was \"you made pesto here\" with smile.

Turned out they make most everything from scratch, they only use natural ingredients. For example, if they want to make it sweet, they use carrots. Carrots natural sweet flavor is added to their food, not sugar.

I got to talk to the chef a little, his family is originally from Sicily island and his cooking style comes from there. Wouldn't have guessed from pictures hanging on the walls.

Their tiramisu is home made, never been frozen after they made. No eggs used. They add whip cream to mascarpone, creating such a delicate texture.

While I was there, a regular customer stopped by to make a reservation and asked for today's special. It was a fish (can't remember the name anymore). I love the way southern Italian fish is cooked. I thought if I could come back for dinner that night.

This is not a fancy place at all but this place sure will satisfy foodies' palete.  Can't wait to coma back to try more food."}

My friend is hard of hearing so asked her to repeat a few things. She almost yelled at him! We did like that you could bring your own wine but doubt we'll give a second try.....too many other choices. Very uncomfortable experience."}

{"text":"OK, Georgie M and I like the same restaurants so after his review of this place, e tried it today for a late lunch. It is busy even at 2PM. There are 9 tables in this restaurant, nothing fancy but cloth tablecloths on the tables. We had the steak Salad which is huge. It had marinated steak with roasted onions, red peppers, black olives, carrots and romaine. The meat was delicious and I like their balsamic dressing that had a good flavor without being too sweet. We also had the Meatball Parm sub. The bread is made in house and is delicious, the meatballs were SOOOO good. We also had a Chicken Parm dinner. The sauce has so much flavor and all of our food was top notch. The prices are reasonable and I just love that the whole family works there, speaking Italian. So authentic. I want to try the pizza and they sell it by the slice also. Glad Georgie told us how busy they gat. As we were leaving we noticed the restaurant was full at 3PM on a Sunday. We will definitely go back. Thanks Georgie, a special place it is."}
{"text":"It's obvious that whoever wrote 5 star reviews for this place has never eaten real authentic Italian cuisine. 

To start, the place is lit with fluorescent tube lights and is brighter than most convenience stores. Hardly the kind of lighting anyone wants to eat dinner in. To continue on about decor would be long winded so I'll say this, if yelp gave a decor rating it would be -1 star. 

My girlfriend and I enjoy eating out and this was not even close to what we expected. The antipasto salad was generic with under roasted peppers and deli sliced meats that were worthy of a grade school sandwich on white bread. The pizza, \"the chefs special\", was greasy and undercooked. Nothing fresh or authentic about this place."}
{"text":"HIGHLY over-rated. AVERAGE food. ADEQUATE service. NO ambiance or atmosphere.

This is nothing more than a carry-out pizza joint that decided to add a few tables, inside & out, and call themselves a 'bistro'. I went there with my Mom and Stepdad on a Friday night and the line for pizza pick-up was out the door at one point. We waited an unusually long amount of time for the waitress to acknowledge us and take our order.
My Mom and I ordered the same dish, the Sauteed Shrimp and Pesto Pasta and I had the Angel Hair and she had the Linguine. The dish was 'edible', but while mine was 'creamy' in consistency, hers was really 'oily'. Tasted alright but nothing to rave about. Best part of the meal was dessert. We ordered the Cannoli, which was pretty good. Why? Because it was NOT made there..that's probably why.
With SO many BETTER options for Italian in the vicinity, I say keep driving past this place and head straight to New York's Best Italian BISTRO and Cafe on 73rd/Thunderbird."}
{"text":"We LOVE this neighborhood place- the owners are adorable and the food is very good. The calzone with added ricotta is by far my favorite and there is plenty to take home. Sit on the patio now that the weather is nice!!!"}
{"text":"What's with all of the hype?  Basil & Garlic Bistro is an ok BYOB place in Scottsdale.  Everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) who lived around us raved about the food.  The fact that Basil & Garlic is BYOB is awesome!  We own a ton of nice bottles of wine and love to bring it as opposed to paying twice as much for the same bottle at a nice restaurant.  

The food is only okay.  The pizzas are large and the crust seems to be a bit soggy from all of the toppings.  I had this pizza at the restaurant one time & to-go another, both with the same results.  I've had better pizza - in the neighborhood you can try Fate, Il Bosco, or Pomo for much better pizza.  

It was pretty empty both times that we went to Basil & Garlic - I'm not sure why everyone who reviews it notes that they had to wait.  We had 0 wait and it seemed a bit weird that no one else was there.  

Overall, the food is fine, but it doesn't live up to all of the hype.  Maybe try the pasta dishes instead of pizza."}
{"text":"Really cute little Italian Bistro .. Katherine was our server & she really helped make our dinner great. Her recommendations were right on & I don't pay that compliment often !! 
We had delicious bruschetta ( they bake their own bread ) . 
White clam & garlic sauce over Angel hair pasta which was super. Meatball appetizer ( good not great ) 
Hubby had a sausage pasta which he loved. 
Plus you can BYOB !! Oh & delicious cheesy garlic bread ..( had to taste it dipped in their great marinara )
Win-win"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after yelp search nearby. Very impressed. Everything was so fresh. Four of us ate. 1 had shrimp salad. Perfect. One had meatball sub. Perfect. One had antipasta. Perfect. One had egg drop spinach soup. Amazing!

Great service, nice people. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food and the service were excellent.  My son just loved the Nutella pizza for dessert.     Would definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"We came on a weekday afternoon and sat on the patio.   They weren't too busy and the service was great!  We each had a salad for starters, then shared a huge and delicious calzone. Great!!  The filling consisted of the ricotta cheese, artichoke hearts , sun dried tomatoes.  Just great, perfect size for sharing.  Good food and great service, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been twice, amazing and fresh homemade food every time, tried three total dishes in fact. This is the kind of hole in the wall neighborhood treasure that everyone always searches for. If they keep making food this good, it will need a larger dining area. The only possible improvement would be better silverware/plates/napkins but who cares about that!"}
{"text":"I have to agree, the food is very good. It takes a long time but worth the wait. 
However, the server who rings up the check, touches cash, wipes his nose with his fingers, dips his hands into the ice dispenser and then cuts the sandwich and wraps it for you is disgustingly uncleanly. I threw away my food.
This restaurant needs to firm up it's food handling process. The guy NEVER washed his hands or used hand sanitizer. As well, many times he was in the kitchen talking with the chef, again wiping his nose with his hands.  Clean  it up, people vote with their feet. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Family owned business, it can't get better than that. Food was amazing! I recommend their pizza. You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Was in a hurry and ran across this place after a quick Yelp search. Service was fast and the pizza was outstanding! Excellent crust...NY authentic!"}
{"text":"Decided to make this our next choice for dinner after reading some reviews on Yelp. It's tucked away in a small corner just off of Cactus road. So I would have never found this place without Yelp. 

We went for an early dinner and was surprised to see we were the only people in the restaurant. There were only about 10 tables so the place was tiny. The decor was nothing fancy but when I go out to eat it isn't about the paintings on the wall. It's all about the food and boy the food surpassed my expectations. Everything on the menu sounded tempting and I decided on the sausage sub. It was a crispy sandwich filled with Italian sausage, onions, and peppers that just came off the grill. The staff offered me some marinara sauce and parmesan cheese to go with it. Fantastic! It was one of several other sub choices. I'll be back to try some of the others. My girlfriend ordered a pizza and it was tasty. The dough was made fresh and you can taste the difference. 

Another astonishing shock was the price! I can believe she got a 12 inch pizza for only 8 bucks. I thought it would be twice the price for something so fresh and authentic. Puts Papa Johns to shame. My sub was more than filling and I'm a starving 23 year old. I didn't even finish it. Here I was concerned there were no side choices. Probably the cheapest meal we've ever paid for and I appreciate that! The staff were extremely friendly and pleasant. Took time to start a conversation with us. This is now a personal favorite of mine as I love Italian food. Too bad I live in Mesa, but worth the drive! Especially to come back and try the desserts I've only seen pictures of."}
{"text":"Home-style Italian food. My husband and I are vegetarians, so the choices are ofcourse limited. We ordered Cheese Fries, Quattro Formaggi and the Chef's Special (vegetarian version). I was told that I could call in advance to order a vegetarian lasagne. We preferred the outdoor seating to the inside of the restaurant. Staff are very pro-active in helping you pick menu items to suit your taste. They also check on you often to make sure you are comfortable. Food was great and had a homely feel ... no fancy plating or over-the-top names! We'll definitely go back to try the pizzas!"}
{"text":"Always delicious & alway friendly. Close to my house so we often get take out & dine in on occasion."}
{"text":"The restaurant is tucked away in a small strip mall in Northern Scottsdale but don't let that deter you from have a great experience at this restaurant. They just don't only have pizzas and calzones but a wide awry of mediterranean food dishes as well.  If you care to bring your own wine there is a liquor store next door, how convenient can that be! The waitress was very attentive and suggested several items on the menu for us.  We will be back on our next trip to Scottsdale to try some of the other dishes on the menus. We had a fun experience here after a long trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this little gem of an Italian place until a mutual friend who works there introduced me and another friend. 

It was a perfect girl's night place. We brought a bottle of wine with us and we all shared a pizza and pasta. We ordered the bolognese with penne and 2 pizzas. I got my own personal pie of pepperoni and black olives and then we also got homeade bread made from scratch before the meal. 

Everything tasted wonderful and the atmosphere was so laid back. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for a quick lunch and we each had a great salad.  The bowl was overflowing and the ingredients unbelievably fresh.  Can't wait to come back to try some of the pasta dishes!  Service was awesome as were her suggestions.  Great neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"Basil and garlic caught our attention when it popped up in what used to be 2 men and a pizza. I wasn't expecting much more than the average pizza from their predecessors but they blew away my expectations. We have eaten here 4 times in the last month and have loved it every time. The pizzas are great, our favorite is the diavola. They are huge with lots of toppings. The menu says 16 inches but I measured it once and it was well over 17\". The crust is soft but chewy and one the best I've found in AZ.

The couple that runs the place are very friendly and the kind of people that make you want to go back. They have a small seating area so you can dine in or take it home. Either way the service is fantastic. Highly recommended if you are looking for something that is not a crappy chain (dominos, papa johns, etc)."}
{"text":"First time on a friend's recommendation and did not disappoint. Would recommend reservations though as the place is small. Love the byob part. I had a scallop and bacon special which was so amazing would definitely order again. Husband got the basil and garlic which was also good (but mine was better). Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent neighborhood Italian restaurant! Terrific sauces, entrees, starters and a wide number of options on the menu. We usually get a stromboli instead of a pizza when we're ordering to go - always good! When we eat in, we often get one of the specials. Had the scallops in white wine pesto cream sauce tonight -it was great! Good, team oriented service in a family owned and operated restaurant. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"This place triggered me to write my first review....

BEST GARLIC BREAD I'VE EVER HAD.

I fancy myself a pizza snob and this place is above and beyond standards. I only ordered pizza and garlic bread, but I can say I will be back without a question and trying out the entire menu over the summer. This is a must try place!"}
{"text":"Really, really, really good! It's a small place tucked in a little strip mall, but we went for an early dinner and were seated right away. We ordered a medium pizza and the spaghetti with meatballs plate and were very happy with our meal. Our new favorite Italian place!"}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! wow! The food here is simply amazing! My fellow helpers didn't steer me wrong! My dad had spaghetti and meatballs and he thoroughly enjoyed it! I had the shrimp and gnocchi in a brandy cream sauce and it was awesome! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a BYOB. There is a liquor store next door, but I prefer to have my server bring my drink to me rather than getting my own! Also, my gnocchi dish could have had a few more shrimp! The owners are great though!!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place I absolutely loved it, but the second time my pizza was burnt and nothing was done to rectify the situation.  The waitress just acknowledged that it was burnt, and asked if I wanted it boxed up.  I'm not one to complain and probably should have asked to see a manager, but figured since the waitress didn't do anything about it, nothing would be done.

I'll definitely try again, and will update my post with the results..."}
{"text":"Garlic and Basil was recommended to us by a friend. We split a pasta and pizza.  Both were satisfactorily but nothing special.  The pesto cream sauce waa laking pine nuts and any good parmesan flavor. The pizza was substantial, but too cheesy and not much red sauce for our tastes and was flavorless. The pizza crust was cooked a nice brown color but lacked flavor.  Overall, it is better than most deliveries but there are much better pizza and pasta restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"We finally went back and the waitress actually remembered us and the events of our earlier meal there! Needless to say, we had pizza and it was perfect. I expect we will go back again."}
{"text":"Love this place. My favorite dish is the Quartto Form....something....it's a white cheese sauce pasta dish that is to die for! It's in the most low key area, but there's something about the restaurant that gives it that \"authentic Italian\" feel. The waitresses are also very accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"I still havent tried Basil & Garlic Bistro's pizza, but I can't wait!! What I have tried is their chicken sandwich which was savory to say the least!! The chicken was juicy and made to perfection with the creamy pesto sauce! The antipasto salad was also super tasty! Definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, yum. Finally... we have found a new pizza place in Scottsdale!  We ordered take out, so cannot comment on the dine in experience (though it was quaint and quiet and had a nice patio that was far too hot to use in the current AZ summer!), but the food was phenomenal!  We ordered a pizza and bruchetta.  YUM. Pizza dough was delicious and my gosh the appetizer was flavorful and so pretty!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza and fried mushrooms are delicious. We did take out and they were prompt, the order was correct.  I would really recommend this place for small or large take out order."}
{"text":"Ok... Seriously not bad but I just don't understand the ratings here. The food was just ok for lunch and the service was alright. Very small restaurant that was Borderline dirty. It was not well kept and the ambiance was terrible. Fluorescent lighting and terrible silverware. I was put off by the location but pushed forward because of the ratings. If you go there with a low expectation I think you may be fine but it is definitely not a hidden gem :/"}
{"text":"Ok; I would like to keep this great restaurant a secret but it would not be right. The food made daily by Claudio is out of this world. I am always torn between a favorite or something new or special. Nadine and Claudio inject such a great welcoming atmosphere.

Can I give it 10 stars!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is also my favorite restaurant in all of Scottsdale. That's a huge step in Scottsdale has a plethora of wonderful restaurants. It's the neighborhood bistro on a husband-and-wife that work their little hearts out and make sure the customers are satisfied. This is my second time back I brought my own bottle of wine and I had chicken Marcella which knocks my socks off. I can't say enough good about this restaurant other than I'm going to have my mail forwarded because this is my new hang out"}
{"text":"During our trip to Scottsdale we frequented this small family owned restaurant multiple time. They have great food. Their pizza is cut to perfection and their homemade bread is great! If you love eggplant, try the Pasta A La Norma! Yummy! It's not on the menu and it has a spicy marinara with deep fried eggplant on top! Wowzers! Amazing food!"}
{"text":"With so many choices we decided to share the chef special which had a very nice presentation (see picture).  The food was hot and the sauce was wonderful when mixed in with the cheese, mushrooms and onions.  There was a $3 split plate fee.  The also had BYOB so you can get a bottle of wine a couple of doors down to have with dinner.

There was a screaming upset child and not sure why the mom did not take them outside, but thank God they soon left and let us enjoy our meal and the cozy low light candle environment.  

The staff was very friendly and made sure we had plenty of water and bread. It was a treat to have what tasted like filtered water.

We look forward to returning to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Great food from a fabulous couple.   You should go for Claudio's cooking and Nadine's delightful charm.  This is a find.  Bring a bottle of wine with you and order anything.  Love the pasta, subs and pizza.

Now I'm hungry.  Calling for a meatball parm sub takeout.  You should be so lucky."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new, so hit up Yelp with a \"nearby\" and stumbled on to this little gem.
In an area where it seems like Italian and pizza places are overflowing, we found what could possibly be the perfect spot. (It could be perfect, but I hate to call it that after one visit)

First the boring stuff - it's just south of Cactus on 94/92nd St (right where they change over) in a small strip mall with what looks like a convenience store, hair salon, and Vapor store). It looks smaller on the outside than it actually is - and I saw seating outside, that I assume they can use for busier  (non rainy) days. It was clean and bright. The tables had table cloths on themn which I appreciate for some unknown crazy reason.

I ordered the Quattro Formagio pasta and my husband gotta the Meatball Parmesian sub. He was quite pleased with his! Mine gave me a choice of pasta type (which I love because everyone has a favorite type, I love the thin Angel Hair). The 4 cheese included gorgonozla, which was an unexpected surprise (well unexpected until I saw it in writing on the menu). And, let me tell you that it worked. It. Was. Wonderful! The single best Quattro Formagio that I have ever had. The hubs used to go to Sicily every year for Reserve duty and he said it definitely rivaled that which he's had there.
They served bread, of course. Not sure what it was, but it kind of reminded me of sour dough and or was good. Saved mine for my pasta, and it was the perfect accompaniment. 

Serving size was perfect for dinner (we had lunch and I had to box about half of mine up).

I highly recommend them. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Picked up pizza . Pizza is on point . Small place , including outside maybe no more than 15 tables . Staff is jumping - quick to serve . Have to come back for a sit down dinner . Everything I saw coming out looked and smelled fantastic . In a corner of a small strip mall - blink and you'll miss it ."}
{"text":"Been to this bistro twice now, once for lunch and once for dinner. Very small family operated cafe with excellent food and tremendously large portion sizes. Service is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite Italian restaurants of all time. The chef and his family are from Naples and truly cook the best authentic food. Every dish I have had there has been amazing. They truly care about their customers and dishes they create. Try the basil and Garlic with chicken or shrimp! Amazing. Loyal customer for life."}
{"text":"Went here as a party of three.  One got the stromboli, one got the philly deluxe sandwich, and one got the grilled chicken salad.  Everyone was happy and everything was super fresh.  The portions were generous and the service was very kind and attentive.  We will be back.   This place is easy to pass by, so make a special note to check it out.  It's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and I was scoping out my new \"go to\" food places. This calzone was great and bigger than expected. I also had to have a slice of pizza so I chose the 'garlic & basil' and it was tasty. And since I read the reviews about Garlic and Basil before I went I read about the Tiramisu and being Italian myself and grandma used to make this, i had to try it - it was just simply Wonderful. I went back 2 nights later and tried a pasta dish, Garlic and Basil in a pesto and tomatoes base sauce, and shrimp over angel hair pasta (you can choose your pasta type). Personally I would have liked more shrimp, but I LOVE shrimp. A definite win win. Great food, the staff is friendly. Oh one point of inconvenience, the young gal at the register did not bag up my order and I had to try and balance everything to leave (4 separate containers), finally another woman noticed my struggle and asked if I would like a bag - ah yes! This should not be a question, this should be done automatically - common sense!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times. Always had excellent food and service. 
If you can score a seat on the patio, it is such a beautiful dining atmosphere. 
It is BYO beer or wine. I have yet to be charged a corkage fee... Not sure if this is a mistake ... But it sure is nice!
Can buy beer or wine next door at the little convenience store. It allows for a great meal with very little $$ for alcohol spent!

Occasionally it takes longer to get your food. Closer to 30-40 min sometimes. But we never go in a hurry, we go to enjoy a night out, so I don't mind this. 

The prices are very fair and the portion sizes are sure to leave you full and happy!
Try the cannoli-- it is amazing!
Basil and garlic special pasta and the baked chefs special are my normal \"go-to's\". Amazing!

We love the mushroom appetizer. You get SO MANY mushrooms and it is only $4.50!!
Give this place a try for great, authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"YUM!!

The homemade bread the sandwiches are served on is very good.

Loved the cannolis too."}
{"text":"Long long long wait on Sunday night. The owners were catering to their family members rather than customers. Waited more than 1 hour to get our dinner salad. ... very disappointed the pasta is not made fresh but comes from a box.. We ordered pizza & the special, pasta with shrimp & eggplant whivh was extremely overpriced. $19.50 for a very small portion of pasta.  The orders took close to 2 hours for them to come out. Never ever again. The pizza was a big disapointment nothing to write home about. Nothing special. This place needs more  waiters & they need to remember the customers come first...Very Very disappointing... They should either take pizza off the menu or get a separate oven just for the pizza which slows all the orders down..Very bad logistics @ the customers expense. Most restaurants would have deducted an entree for the long wait or apologized, they did neither. It was not a very good experience.  This place is Hit or Miss. They are not consistent in their food. Very Very disappointed. Also very very noisy."}
{"text":"Very glad we came here! Will be back! Had calamari, chicken Caesar salad, and namesake pasta dish- pesto and shrimp, all delicious and then homemade tiramisu yummy. BYOB and wine selection at corner store. Very friendly staff and owners."}
{"text":"This place is really cute. I held my monthly wine club here and they were able to accommodate my vegan diet with a delicious pasta dish! I will eat here again for sure.  Every one was pleased with their dinner."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Small cozy atmosphere and fabulous food.  Excellent service friendly staff.The sausage is amazing great flavor. Wish I was in town longer to come and try everything on the menu. This place would put some of the places on Taylor street to shame."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our second visit, after a great weeknight dinner experience at the restaurant,  was on a Friday at 6:30PM reservations.  We arrived to a full restaurant and our reservations had not been recorded.  They did have a table for us and were seated at 6:40PM.  My wife and I ordered the same menu item as our first visit (spaghetti, meat sauce, made with angel hair pasta.  Our dinners were served at 7:50PM.  The spaghetti and its sauce were  barely warm and poorly drained such that the sauce was watery.  Such a difference from our first visit!!!!.  I suspect the restaurant had far too many orders for take-outs plus the full restaurant to a quality job of anything!  

Don't go on a Friday!"}
{"text":"You might not like Basic & Garlic Bistro.  It is about as far removed from fine dining as you can get without being fast food.  The restaurant is small and simply decorated, but it is clean and it has tables with tableclothes and comfortable chairs.  The couple who own and run it are young and probably make mistakes from time to time.  But they are enthusiastic, they try hard, and the food is REALLY GOOD.

You can get pizza by the slice for $1.85 plus 35 cents (that's no typo) for each topping.  Get one topping - they put on plenty.  These slices are 1/8 of a 16-inch pie, so two will fill me up but I could eat three or four if I had to.  That makes for a pretty cheap dinner.  That's the best buy on the menu -- other choices are moderately priced but not ridiculously inexpensive.

The pizza is very thin crust, fairly crisp, and covered in a standard mozzarella cheese.  The pepperoni topping was the usual, the sausage appeared to be homemade and was mild but delicious, and the meatball was just about as good as it gets.  It all worked together to make a fine old-time pizza.  My wife had a sub which came on freshly baked and crusty bread that had her insisting that I try a piece because it was SO good.  When she got full, she ate the sandwich filling, which she said was even better than the bread.

This is a neighborhood affordable Italian eatery.  Cut them some slack.  For what they try to be, they are as good as it gets, and that is plenty good enough to have me coming back."}
{"text":"My family goes here every single Saturday. They will cook anything to order and everything is fresh. I can not stress enough how much we love this place. The owners are phenomenal and extremely talented chefs. Our favorite local spot. They have a great menu selection, ranging from pizza to seafood."}
{"text":"We just returned from dinner at Basil and Garli Bisrtro with doggie bags filled for another delicious meal. Needless to say, portions were plentiful. Filled and satisfied we were thrilled to fine a new neighbor gem tucked away off the main big streets. The atmosphere is small, warm and friendly. the owners are delightful.  We shared an antipasto salad (large enough fo four) that was very tasty. Two of us had eggplant parmigiana . They said it was the best they ever had. I had the Rucola e Gamberetti, a mild shrimp (large) pasta dish with fresh tomatoes and angula. Delicious.  Another guest asked them to special order a pizza and the chef was nice enough to accommodate his request.
It seems to be a great place for a quick slice of pizza , a sit down lunch or dinner,or best yet - take out and enjoy it at home."}
{"text":"This place is kinda far from me, but I stopped in to check the place out since it changed from Two Guys Pizza or whatever it was. I went in after lunch, and it wasn't super busy - but they still had a steady stream of customers coming in. Neighborhood locals who were apparently already all hooked on their food. 

The owners were an adorable young couple - both originating from other Countries before moving here. They were fun and charming. We had a nice chat before I got fed. I like them and hope they do well... going by the other reviews here, I have no doubt they will - even in the unassuming little corner location.

So I ordered a Cheesesteak because my diet lately has been pizza and cheesesteaks and I need to cool it and start eating more salads and going to the gym, but a cheesesteak sounded good and that's what I wanted, so shut up! 

Anyway, the sandwich was unlike any cheesesteak I had seen... they make their own bread for the sandwich, and it seems to be based on the pizza crust dough. It was one of the most unique cheesesteak sandwiches I've had and easily in my top 5 in Phoenix. The meat was tender and flavorful - perfectly seasoned. 

Now, I know that most cheesesteaks in the Valley are made of the same meat - most restaurants get their sliced ribeye meat from the same vendor. The reason some places taste better or worse is due to a number of factors - how they store the meat, how they season it (if they even season it at all), and how they prepare it. That being said - this is definitely a place not to be missed.

I asked another patron to see their pizza they were picking up as she was leaving and it looked and smelled amazing. If I wasn't so full and if it wouldn't have been ridiculous, I might have ordered one of those to go so I could eat it for dinner or breakfast or whatever. I'm glad I didn't because I was full until I went to bed. I didn't feel bloated or anything - just full as in not hungry. 

I also saw a calzone being prepared - gigantic/epic. 

This is a top quality restaurant. I'd drive out of my way to come back here... probably will."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night and were greeted immediately by the owner. We had been enticed by the reviews on Yelp and it lived up to the hype. I ordered the meatballs and my wife had the bolognese - both were delicious, large servings at a great price.

It's a BYOB with a very reasonable $4.50 corkage fee - and a convenience shop next door with a decent selection of wine. Garlic cheese bread was good as well (not on the menu) and the cheesecake was exceptional. All around great experience. If you like the atmosphere where an owner knows customers like they are family you will love this place and it's energy. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific food. We eat a lot of Italian food and this is some of the best we have ever had in the valley. Freshly home made bread. Good service. Friendly staff. Outside seating.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I just walked in to check out the place. I was craving bruschetta to have with my salad that I had purchased next door, and wanted to see if they had it in the menu. Unfortunately they do not have it on the menu, but the gentleman was so kind that he told me \"I will make it for you.\" What a great first impression. This is why I continue to support small to medium businesses. Keep it up and thank you."}
{"text":"Just tried this place as it is truly a local business. I've heard good things from people and read 5-star reviews on yelp. Maybe that is why my expectations were so high! 

Everything said in other reviews about the wonderful owners is true. They are very nice and friendly. 
However, the people raving about the food must be crazy. The flavors are very Americanized! And the pasta is not fresh but from a box. I ordered the Bolognese, the sauce had a nice taste but did not have the spice of a true Italian Bolognese and had way too many tomatoes. Moreover, the centers of the meat chunks were cold...a dead giveaway for a reheated sauce...
The chefs special pasta has cheap deli lunch meat ham, making a decent tasting sauce very cheap. 

I plan to try the pizza before making a final judgement, but at this point I am less than impressed."}
{"text":"I came here because my Ingress friends.  One of them was too busy catching a super rare Pokemon.  The other one suggested that I try Basil and Garlic. Basil and Garlic is a small restaurant located in a strip shopping center in Scottsdale.  The were not too busy when we arrived and were seated immediately.  

We ordered their vongole with a white sauce and a bolognese with a penne pasta.  Complimentary bread was given to us.  The vongole was the best dish of the night.  The flavor was good and had a decent amount of clams in it.  The daughter and I have had better bolognese.  We both thought that their bolognese was a too acidic (sour).  I finished it, while my daughter finished all their bread.  We didn't really want to ask for more bread since our dinner was already finished.  Luckily we had vitasoy and red bean dessert in the car.  

Service was good.  They kept us filled with bread and kept our cups filled with water.  It was an okay visit.  There is better food, according to the other Yelp reviews...if we had only took the time to read them.  But, with one visit, 3 star is what I can give them."}
{"text":"Great little spot with amazing garlic bread and the best eggplant Parmesan anywhere. I'm vegetarian so I get eggplant parm a lot and this was definitely a winner. The service was great and the wait staff was pleasant and accommodating. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really high quality cheesesteak served on fresh ciabatta. Good spice to the meat and tasty summer tomatoes. I had the deluxe hoagie, it has a little pepperoni in it and is totally delish."}
{"text":"You need to come here for the food alone. It is so amazing! We ordered pizza, pasta, and salad and everything was perfect. The pizza was BETTER than the ones I had in New York!!! It's a nice little family owned restaurant and the outside seating is beautiful. I would definitely recommend this place. Amazing food!!"}
{"text":"Oh this place is a little gem. The best calzone I've ever had is here. It's a cute family owned place and totally worth making a drive if you're  craving a calzone!"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE!!  Absolutely recommend!  My husband and I had the calamari (fantastic light batter) onion rings, fries, chicken parm sub (amazingly crispy bread, moist chicken and delicious cheese), sausage pizza (perfectly crispy and the sausage was amazing) and clam pasta with red sauce (lots of clams, great pasta cooked perfectly) - everything was fantastic!!  Flavorful and fresh!  The tomato sauce is out of this world - We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at this local restaurant. Food was amazing and I would definitely recommend. From pizza, salads and specials...everything was good. Also fantastic tiramisu. No alcohol. BYOB. Not a fan of the corking fee...the only reason not a 5 star. Love BYOB but fee is not warranted. Place was packed on Saturday night."}
{"text":"Tucked in a small corner strip mall may be unassuming...  
This is a little hidden gem of a family business that is making authentic Italian dishes...  
BYOB  makes it even more Special!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food! Small restaurant reminding me of Europe. A dozen table inside and a small outdoor area. We were there for Mother's Day. It was quite busy and thank god o had made a reservation . Both , pizzas and pastas are delicious. Good price and good portions. They bake their own bread and it is amazing. I would give them 5 but the service was a bit slow ."}
{"text":"My wife and I attempted to eat here last night.  We arrived around 7:30 PM as several tables of people were finishing up their meals.  The told us to wait and they'd seat us shortly.  So we sat there as we see people leave.  Yet, no one is making any attempt to clear any of the several unused tables of their dirty dishes so that we can be seated.  So we just sit there and wait.

After 15 minutes of waiting, the guest at one of the nearby tables apparently had a complaint about how long it took for their pizza to be made.  The cook came out and rudely cussed at them that he's very busy because they have takeout orders in addition to their order and they just have to wait.  Anyway, after witnessing this extreme rudeness from the cook, we lost the desire to wait any longer and eat there.

We likely won't be making another attempt to eat here."}
{"text":"Outstanding find!  Friendly and welcoming, food is great and prices very reasonable.  Their pizza is especially good - the best I've had in the Phoenix area, with only one exception - Pizzeria Bianco in downtown Phoenix.  Really the best little Italian restaurant around.  We've become regulars, as have a number of friends."}
{"text":"Meh.  The food was ok.  I tried the B&G sandwich which wasn't as appealing as it sounded.  Pretty good food, I'll be back to try something else."}
{"text":"They may have good food, however, they will not stay in business without presenting the total package.

I've eaten at B&G 4 times now and certain things have remained consistent...
- Most of the food is truly yummy although I can't speak for the non-pasta dishes.  
- Don't order the calamari...unless you are keen on tasteless and rubbery food.
- The service is NOT good.  Tonight, we were seated at the table that is closest to the mostly open kitchen and I both saw and heard our server give our order to the chef almost an hour after we had ordered it.  15 mins prior, I had asked her to check on it and now I know it hadn't even been ordered.
- They don't brew coffee!  My dad loves his coffee and three times he's been disappointed at the end of his meal when he's asked for coffee and been told, \"We don't have any that's been brewed\".  Tonight, dad thought he'd outfox them and asked for coffee when we ordered dinner, to be brought right away.  Remember what I told you about service?  She didn't remember to bring dad's coffee until the meal came and then had the nerve to say it had  to brew.  Does it take well over an hour for coffee to brew?  She forgot the sweetener, so I got up and got it.    NO APOLOGY.

A few words about my first visit...
40 minutes before closing,  they were mopping the kitchen floor which is mostly open to the restaurant, which only has nine tables.  We were trying to enjoy our food, but the overpowering smell of amonia wafting over the table and all around us, made it impossible.  I asked the server to have them stop mopping, which they did, for 10 whole minutes.  NO APOLOGY. 

I will get food from them again, but only as take-out.  I will not subject myself to the incredible noise level created by kitchen staff  who drop and bang pots, pans and dishes consistently or to servers who can't handle the \"pressure\" of a 9-table restaurant.  Customer service is a huge thing to me and they've missed the mark.  How is all of this acceptable to the owners?"}
{"text":"Unassuming little corner restaurant with limited indoor and outdoor seating (reservations recommended) in Scottsdale. We did not have reservations and the hostess squeezed us in. Servers very friendly and attentive. We ordered the garlic basil pizza which was delicious. You could see the cook tossing the homemade crust in the kitchen from where we sat. We talked to a local who said he picks up food for take out several times a week. \"That is how good it is!\""}
{"text":"I found Basil & Garlic Bistro on Yelp today and decided to try out this new place based on the reviews. I had the 2-slices of pizza lunch special. The food was really good. Loved the cheese and thin crust. Price was very reasonable. The owners are really friendly and I look forward to trying the rest of the items on their menu. While I was there a waiter from Grimaldi's stopped in to grab a couple of sandwiches to go. Interesting! The location is about 1/2 a mile north of Shea on 92nd Street, and currently there is road construction hindering traffic, but not too bad. I look forward to trying their homemade Tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Tons of free parking right outside the restaurant. The patio is so adorable with tons of lights. Really sets a nice vibe for a romantic evening. Service was really great as well! 

The pizza slices are huge! Three friends and I shared the Chef's Favorite pizza (large) and was not able to finish it. I think if you are not hungry, a table of four would be able to share a small. We also had a pasta to share. We tried the Boscaila and it was amazing. It had Italian sausage, mushrooms and spinach with brandy cream sauce. For appetizers, we had the garlic bread with cheese and the cheese fries. I wouldn't get the cheese fries again but would definitely get the garlic bread. It was served with marinara sauce!"}
{"text":"We came in kind of late (8:20 pm) yet they were graceful to find us a perfect table and make it super romantic and pretty. We ordered the specials (mine was delicious shrimp with sun dried tomatoes and poetic& tasty spaghetti made al dente just like 5 stars restaurants in Europe). My husband had chicken with delicious arrabiata sauce and egg plant graced by rigatoni pasta:)). We were impressed and are huge plates of food even though we both are thin people. We were blessed to order the tiramisu to go and enjoy it today. Amazing!!:)) I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food! This is our first time here and it was fantastic! Service is great too.  Try the antipasto salad. Lasagna and chicken parmigiano, yes please! 

We will definitely be back when we come back to AZ. The owner is from Sicily, everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"Today my friends and I tried this place out for the first time. My friend found it by doing a search for restaurants in the area.  As previously posted, the restaurant is small but there was a lot of in and out traffic for take out so we figured the food has to be good. 

As we waited for the rest of our party to arrive we had some of their fresh made bread which was really good. Our group ordered everything from pizza to calzones to pasta to one of their hot subs made with their fresh bread. All of the food was delicious and the portions are generous for the price. 

The staff was very friendly as well. We all enjoyed our dinner and we will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"One word: Cioppino 

(for two - one regular - one spicy please!)

By far our favorite place.  This place smokes any italian place we went to in Manhattan NY before we moved back home and we had some favorites to include Luciano Pavarotti's favorite, Cafe Fiorello's in Lincoln Center.  Claudio and Nadine invest in their business through a TON of hard work and the happiness of their clients by getting into the mix and interacting.  I can't believe that this restaurant is in walking distance from home.  Oh, and their pizza? .....WOW!!!"}
{"text":"What GREAT food!!  We drive here from the far west side of Phoenix because we like it so much.  The people are awesome and go out of their way to treat you right.  What a good find.  Thank you Yelp!"}
{"text":"We dined in the restaurant and recently picked up a pizza for home.  The food is delicious.  The pizza is always filled with lots of toppings.  Suggestion would be to cook the crust a little crispier and slightly burnt on the edges.  Overall, a fine neighborhood restaurant to experience and offers wonderful service."}
{"text":"Wonderful Pasta, Comfy setting, and Sweet Service.  Will be going back to try Pizza. Bring your own wine or beer."}
{"text":"It's official: their pizza is so fresh that it keeps a week in the fridge! 

And it wasn't our willpower that kept it there that long. It was a wacky travel schedule. 

I can't believe it's been over a year (9/21/14!) since our first visit to this casual little strip mall restaurant. I was ready to give the five stars then, but most certainly now, after our additional visits. 

Pizza, calzones, sandwiches, salads, pasta dishes and do you want fries with that? Weird! But perfect because our first visit here had my husband craving fries and me wanting pizza. He and I were also growly (not just stomachs) but mentally over a pool pump debacle. Food cures everything!? Well, delicious food and good company goes  goes a long way toward making a annoying circumstance a lot brighter and fondly memorable.

The owners are a delight. Nadine introduced herself and Claudio came over to say hello on our first visit. We got to talking about Europe, how those two met and so on.... It's always a treat to meet the owners and to hear the stories that make a place \"the\" place. Claudio also told us of his Sicilian heritage and how \"Basil and Garlic's\" logo embodies it. Cool! 

We have eaten heartily of: fresh bread, regular pizza, speciality pizza (El Diavlo), calzone, salad, and those fries. It's BYOB. The outdoor patio is set-up for those days when it's not 110. What this resto lacks in \"ambiance\" (i.e. your date may find it on the \"simple\" side), it makes up for via heart and flavor. Generous portions, too. Don't wait for a pool pump debacle, B&G is worth a visit all on its own."}
{"text":"This is a well kept secret! Wonderful food, mussels with spicy marinara sauce is outstanding. Claudio is the owner and really works hard and it pays off. Great food!! Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp when looking for Italian takeout. Gave them a try and fell in love. The garlic bread with cheese is amazing!! We also love the lasagna."}
{"text":"Small family owned restaurant.  The food is very good and always prepared fresh.  The decor is terrible but the great service and good food make up for that. I highly recommend giving this restaurant a visit.  Im sure you will enjoy it, unless Olive Garden is your idea of good Italian food."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this cute little restaurant for the longest time after reading such good things. I went with 3 friends and we each got a slice of pizza....This was most likely the problem. The slices were nothing special, but most likely because they, like most places at lunch, reheat slices before serving. The pizza may be really good when it's fresh, but it was mediocre reheated and served for lunch. The prices were outrageously cheap though, so that was nice. I'd like to come back to try their food fresh for dinner, I think it would probably be much better."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza homemade taste. Freshest ingredients and the best white pizza I have ever had. I usually don't like white pizza. We came from out of state and decided to eat here on a whim based on reviews. Customer service, especially given that we went around 3-330pm, was very good. They also took care of my 1.5yr old by giving her penne mixed with butter, garlic, and cheese."}
{"text":"A nice family restaurant! I had the basil  and garlic pasta!  Very good friendly staff."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place doesn't have some kind of national recognition for their sandwiches. The Stromboli bread so so light and thin with a tender crunch. The Fiorentino combination of spinach, garlic and thinly cut chicken was perfection. You'd expect the chicken breast to be overcooked and dry. Not so here. If it couldn't get any better the homemade bread its served on ties it all together."}
{"text":"Perhaps we hit the wrong night--perhaps the waitstaff was having a bad night...perhaps the moon was full.  Our waitress acted like we were putting her out--she  brought the check before we finished eating.. she seemed annoyed at our mere presence...one dish was cool in the center as if it was simply heated over by tossing some sauce on top.
I had been here before and it was good--will give it another chance.  This nite seemed to simply overwhelm them completely.
One flaw that will never change is the ambiance--noise level and 'outdoor dining' is actually in a parking lot."}
{"text":"My family loves going out for authentic Italian food. 
Decided to check out this local (hidden) favorite and I was more than pleased. 
Dishes were hot and fresh. Service was outstanding. The head chef even came out to introduce himself. 
They have a good mix of chef originals and just traditional meals. 
Fresh warm bread is delivered upon being seated. 

it's BYOB (wine) with a small and fair corking fee.  ($5) 

Come hungry and save room for dessert. The tiramisu is  


Next visit I plan on trying a sandwich or pizza! See u soon."}
{"text":"We just ate dinner at Basil and Garlic Bistro for the first time and had a delicious meal with wonderful service!  The restaurant is very small with spartan decor, but this family owned bistro serves up delicious entrees from scratch and everything we ate was wonderful!  Chicken cacciatore, ciopino, eggplant parmesan, and spaghetti bolognese were among the entrees we ordered and each was freshly prepared and so very flavorful!  The bruschetta, as an appetizer, was also plentiful and yummy!  I hope that someone from Diners, Drive- ins and Dives or, locally, Check Please Arizona, comes over to this relatively new restaurant to see for themselves how good it is there!"}
{"text":"Great little spot right down the street from my house. Clean comfortable and very good food. I've only had the by the slice for the lunch special 2 slices a drink for $7 but everything else looks very good as well. We'll be coming back. Also the two owners are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I have come here several times with coworkers for lunch and been delighted each and every time. The owners, Claudio and Nadine, are wonderful and friendly and their presence has always added to the experience--they are a young couple with beautiful little children and it is easy to tell how passionate they are about creating delicious food. I highly recommend the calzones--filled with amazing ingredients of your choice and HUGE. I've sampled many of my coworkers dishes including the veggie sandwich, which is loaded with an array of exquisitely roasted vegetables, and loved them all.

One note--to the person who found the Quattro Formaggi too cheesy--you may want to reconsider ordering the dish titled 'Four Cheese' if cheese is not your thing."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! It was our first visit and the staff was kind and offered great suggestions. Everything was great from the dinner rolls to the desert. Would suggest the Lasagna!"}
{"text":"Worst customer services I've seen surprising they are still open long time client not anymore it seems they don't care"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here multiple times in the past few months. On our first time in, we ordered the special for the night (fried eggplant over spicy spaghetti) and the owner visited with us after we had finished our dinner. She told us about coming over from Europe and opening the restaurant and sat down and talked with us about our family.

When we came back a month later, she remembered us - which is crazy for how many people come through that restaurant in a month's time. Even though the fried eggplant wasn't on the menu the second time we came in, she was more than happy to make it for us again.

We have been back a couple times since - every time has been enjoyable and delicious. The servings are large and authentic. The dessert pizzas are to die for too!"}
{"text":"Small strip mall location just south of Cactus on 94th (at Poinsetta cross street).  Very good crispy yet chewy crust on pizza slices, savory tomato sauce, and enjoyed the fried mushroom appetizer as well (large portion for the price).  Service was very personable and warming.  Prices were reasonable too.  Only about 8 tables here, so I'll go during off hours or just do takeout.  Would kindly recommend they get rid of the tablecloth condom covers - just clean the tablecloths or put glass over them.  The condoms don't exactly enhance the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Aaaaaamaaaazing 
Everything from the service, food, desert and location. 
We enjoyed our homemade pastas, pizza, fried mushrooms, mozzarella sticks and shrimp salad. 
The location is in a very small strip. We choice to sit outside in the little patio. Shannon & Claudio went above and beyond even carefully put away our left overs so it would fit into or small refrigerator in our hotel. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"When out in Scottsdale for spring training, we wanted to go out one night for dinner somewhere away from downtown and go somewhere where locals would tend to go. After cruising yelp, we found Basil & Garlic Bistro, and it did not dissapoint! 

Hidden away in a strip mall, we would have never known it was there by just driving past it. A true hidden gem. 

One of the cool things about this joint is that it's a BYOB restaurant, and even better, there is a store right next to Basil & Garlic that has a wide variety of wine to purchase.

We requested a seat outside to enjoy the nice spring weather and ordered up an appetizer of cheesy garlic bread. So good! I was unsure of what to order, but then I looked a table over and saw chicken parm, so I had to have that. 

The portions here are good sized, and reasonably priced. The food here is really good, quite surprising considering the quaint location. I could only have about half my entree before I needed a box. 

Service was top notch also. Very friendly wait staff and the wait for our food was not long at all. I do recommend making reservations as the inside is small, and if you want to eat outside there are not that many tables. 

When we do come back to Scottsdale next year, we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Lovely lunch on the patio this weekend. Our food from the bruschetta to the Vongole, clams were so good with white sauce and angel hair to Pizza then desserts it was ALL exceptional. I can't wait to come many more times to try everything on the menu. 
I love Yelp when we can find a true hidden gem, Thank You Again"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. Seriously. In my group, we had spaghetti, pizza, and calzones. The prices are very reasonable as well. My friend said it best when I asked him how his food was; ohmygoditisamazing & idonthavetimeforthespacebarimeatingthistreasure. Suffice to say, I will be back."}
{"text":"It was 2 o'clock in the afternoon and I had been up since midnight.  I drove 400 miles and just walked around massive antique sale.  Family was feeling Italian, I was feeling my patience drain.  The food at Basil and Garlic was personally responsible for the fate of all of Scottsdale.  If I didn't fill my gullet with good food, I was going to lose my s@#t.  This establishment laughed in the face of danger and packed our table with wonderful Italian food with amazing flavor.  We covered all our bases by ordering a few different pasta dishes and a sandwich.  I wont go into the idle details of who had what, cause I ate them all.  I normally bat clean up for our team, but this time they all tapped out early cause of the big portions, so I had an (happy) cavalcade of Italian delights.  I would like to say the sauces were to die for, but it was more than that.  The sauces were to kill for.  Yep, you heard it here first.  I could choke someone for a plate of their sauce.  So good, will be back.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Loved it!! We were staying in North Scottdale and wanted Italian/Pizza that wasn't too fancy schmamcy. I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try based on the reviews. I had the pesto shrimp pasta and we had a pepperoni and sausage pizza. Both were delish! I especially loved the pizza."}
