{"text":"Used to be a regular, unfortunately the quality of the food has exponentially decreased in the past year or so... While the prices keep going up..."}
{"text":"Love a good Cajun meal and this is the place. Friendly service, casual neighbourhood eatery at very reasonable prices! I could drink their Cajun sauce & don't even get me started on the desserts! yum, yum, yum, yum yum"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday. Service was excellent & we were served with a smile. My boyfriend had the gumbo as an appetizer but it was horrible, and lacking a flavour. But the shrimps in it were excellent. 
We enjoyed our main courses which were jambalaya and the shrimp pasta. The shrimps were the best part, but as much as we liked those, we wouldn't come back. It was average in our books."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the southern US and generally love Cajun food, so I was a little hesitant to have Cajun this far north. I was not disappointed. I like the atmosphere and loved the food. The shrimp creole was delicious and the bread pudding was awesome. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant! A must try! I've been to a few restaurants in Montreal and I mean it when i say this place has delicious food and great service! Try it!"}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful wait staff. Good selection on the menu, kicked our cajun experience off with yummy hushpuppies- tasted just like they make èm in Memphis :) Enjoyed a delicious grilled shrimp pasta. Wine list was extensive and yet still affordable. Overall lovely experience."}
{"text":"A favourite for some years now.  La Louisiane's quality of food and the professionalism of the young staff makes this restaurant a 5 star experience in our opinion.  We frequently make the La Louisiane our \"special occasion\" outing and recommend it to all of our friends who may be visiting the city. 

I've tried many of the dishes on the menu and have always found the dishes to be correctly spiced according to the recipes.  Cajun food is not for the meat and potatoes crowd. My personal favourite is blackened catfish, while another friend is a big fan of the Dino Ribs.  

The decor and the general ambiance is outstanding.  The staff always seems to manage to make us feel as if we are \"home.\""}
{"text":"My companions ordered fish and chicken and were well satisfied with both, as well as the soup.
I, unfortunately, ordered a prime rib steak. Because the order was badly timed by the staff, after waiting over 50 minutes for our food, it all arrived. My steak, while a generous cut, supposedly medium rare, had obviously been sitting under a heating lamp, because the thick brown \"sauce\" it was swimming in had a hard skin all over. And the medium rare had deteriorated to medium well. The taste was ok, but my meal was best described as \"chewy\". I explained to the waiter why less than half was consumed but did not get a refund or a free dessert. La Louisiane has been in business long enough to learn to time the preparations of various dishes  so they all are ready at the same time.
In addition my advise is to eat there early, as when the place fills up the noise is horrendous. All hard surfaces and the kitchen is very noisy too. I must admit that the chocolate pie was excellent and fresh. Too bad about my main course."}
{"text":"The crab cakes, although not Baltimore blue crab, were delicious. I didn't get that \" eating sawdust\" feeling that I usually get when noshing on inferior crab cakes from, say, such seafaring states like Vermont or Nevada.
I followed those up with a plate of Dinosaur Ribs that too were perfectly cooked and fall off the bone tender but, can I tell you; I'm pretty sure that those were beef ribs despite our server's insistence that it was T-Rex that was on the menu.
Try their Sazerac though; it's epic - I kid you not!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was in such a hurry that she didn't take drink orders and when our food was brought out immediately and  unexpectedly fast we had to ask if she would take a drink order. Her response was, \"You should have told me you wanted drinks.\"  ????? Although menu is extensive it is NOT authentic Cajun. And I know Cajun!  Blackened Arctic char was a plain sautéed filet swimming in a dark sauce that tasted canned. PEI oysters were a good choice but had to ask for spice."}
{"text":"Very comfortable place on Sherbrooke in NDG.   Always busy, always manages to find really great staff.
Our last visit was very much like all of the others - consistently good.
We started with some fun cocktails (Bourbon peach cobbler and a Sazarac cocktail), had alligator for the appetizer then had our mains (Cajun shrimp and crab cakes).    Everything we got tasted pretty terrific.    The rice was a teensy bit dryer than it should have been but it's really no big deal - the shrimp more than made up for it.
If you haven't gone, you should really try it.    Fun experience, great looking restaurant, you'll enjoy your whole evening."}
{"text":"We came here hoping to try their special for Mac and cheese week.  It was a Sunday night, but they had ended their Mac and cheese special on Friday so we were out of luck.  We ordered hush puppies and sweet potato fries to start.  The hush puppies never showed up (we weren't charged for them).  The fries were shoestring style and pretty good.  I had the red snapper special which came with the soup of the day, eggplant parmigiana.  The soup was really good and the highlight of my meal.  The fish was a little disappointing, bland and slightly over cooked.  My daughter had the crab cakes which were really good.  My husband had ribs which he thought were \"ok\".  There were hints of Cajun spices in the meals but no real serious heat.  Maybe you have to request it.  

The place had a nice laid back neighbourhood vibe and aside from forgetting one of our appetizers, service was good."}
{"text":"I've been here sooo many times, and am never let down! Nice little resto, with a small terrace in the summer. The little spiced cornbreads they bring with your bread basket are to die for, as are their sweet potatoe fries (totally worth the $2 surcharge to upgrade from regular fries - to be dipped in spicy mayo).
Blackened fish of the day (last time it was rainbow trout) and dinosaur beef ribs are my 2 favourites on the menu. They have regularly chaging specials which are always worth a try as well.
The only negative is that service is very variable. If you don't take an appetizer, then you'll have a wait for your main meal. And waiters tend to leave you alone for long stretches, but are never too far to be flagged down if need be. The open kitchen adds a nice atmosphere and delicious smells permeate the room!"}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant with a fantastic atmosphere. I went there with some friends after work for some cocktails and Cajun food. Tuesday nights they have a band, and on this occasion did not disappoint, with some mellow blues and grass roots music. The food was spicy but amazing. Thoroughly recommend their shrimp and raw oysters."}
{"text":"Went here again.
They gained a star!
Why?
Well for one the service was better, and secondly they offered me Blair's Ultra Death sauce when I wanted things spicier.

You won my heart with the ridiculous spicy sauce *high five*"}
{"text":"Visited here on a recent trip to Montreal. Ambiance was fun and welcoming. Great indoor seating in front of large open windows looking out on to peaceful Montreal street. Great Servers. Very friendly and informative. We found out the history of the restaurant and heard a bit about the current owners' effort to turn it into the stylish establishment it now is. We ordered from the specials menu which offered tasty dishes like roasted pork loin with asparagus and fennel and pan seared halibut with bacon. Wine list offered affordable quality options. To top it off they were playing 70's disco all night which was awesome. All in all a very enjoyable experience. We will return on our next visit."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. If you are not a fan of spicy food this is NOT the place for you. I would say that we enjoyed the appetizers more than the entrees. The ambience was great as well as the service. I would recommend the cocktails!"}
{"text":"Nice sitting outside on the terrace on saturday night, advised to arrive around 9pm to have a table for 3, since they didn't take reservations. The 9$ mint julip was over loaded with ice and the portions were not large, one of my friends from usa said he'd been there a few times over the years they've been operating. Lots of choice in Montreal so next time I'll try another resto on Sherbrooke street instead."}
{"text":"La Louisiane is one of the better options for restaurants if you live in the NDG area of Montreal. It's Cajun inspired food is really good but be careful when ordering anything spicy. It really is spicy but the chef can tone it down for anyone with a sensitive palette. I went in with some girlfriends and didn't feel like ordering a meal so I went with the shrimp cocktail and shared a plate of 12 oysters for $30. Both were delicious however I prefer traditional shrimp sauce with shrimp cocktails in comparison to their in-house dip. For the oyster dish, unfortunately they were out of horseradish but I love my oysters with Tobasco so I was happy. Paired with a nice bottle of red wine, the three of us were really happy with our meal and happier that we didn't need to go downtown to enjoy great food. NDG needs more places like this."}
{"text":"A bit pricy, but worth it in my opinion. Helpful service, nicely prepared food and an attractive dining area."}
{"text":"One of our only Cajun restaurants but at least it's a good one, and out in a section on NDG that keeps getting cuter. This place has been earning their reputation for over 20 years, not clichéd decor, just a nice, candlelit restaurant with buzz, good gumbo, and some awesome \"dinosaur\" beef ribs."}
{"text":"Mixed.  The food is unpredictable.  Sometimes it's been good,  other times oily.

Tonight, not so good.  Mostly to do with the service.  

The house wine was absolutely inferior, like two-buck chuck, told the waiter, but he didn't care much. 

My companion's dish was a $24 linguini mussel dish, where we literally counted 2 mussels.  Told the waiter, he checked with the chef who said he put in 6 ... Uh, we would have seen six mussels.  

Being from Los Angeles, I'm used to servers caring about what the customer says or feels.  This server couldn't be bothered, I felt like we were just nuisances - not sure I'd it's because of the coupon or just his style."}
{"text":"La Lousisiane is a favorite local NDG resto. I recommend you try the baked mussels appetizer and shrimp magnolia for main dish; can't go wrong. Well priced and welcoming."}
{"text":"Delicious ribs and crab cakes! One of my favourite southern/Cajun places in the city!"}
{"text":"If I close my eyes pretend there is some Louis Armstong playing while the smoke from the kitchen fills the air and open them slowly you could almost believe you are in the Big Easy!  

Tonight I had a great dinner here with my wife!  She had a Chardonnay, I had a Hurricane to get the evening rolling!  Very nice I must say!  We ordered a small green salad to start which was just greens and a nice light vinaigrette dressing! Then for the main course the waitress warned us the Dinosaur Beef ribs were all sold out for the night!  Dang, I was sorta feeling like them!  Que to second choice I ordered the Cajun combo and wifey ordered the Creole Shrimp!  Plus, of course we needed some sweet potato fries to fill up that tummy!  All came out in quick order and was delish, spicy and well presented!  For desert it was all about the Double chocolate chip bourbon pecan pie!  Afterwards we felt like we needed to un-notch the pants but were more than satisfied with the meal!  

I've eaten here 9 years ago and once in between and the restaurant still has that same great ambiance and look to it!  If I lived in NDG it would probably be a once a month hit up!  

Some notes to mention to the owners if reading:

Please try serving some better coffee!  It tastes like brown water!  

Also some N'awlins jazz wouldn't have hurt, but you may be sick of that from perhaps trying it sometime in your 20 years of operation!  Still, it would help fit the ambiance of the place and make me believe I was really in the Big Easy (sleazy!)."}
{"text":"First time there the other night. My initial reaction was that the restaurants atmosphere is exactly my type for a nice night of wine and food. I ordered three appetizers and a cocktail to start, of course. Our waitress Tina was so helpful in the deciding of what to try, as we wanted a bit of everything. She even went as far to bring a taste of one of the sauces and explain the textures and flavours. Our table was constantly cleaned and maintained. The cocktails were well made and the food was delicious. The food consisting of beef rib, oysters, and shrimp, accorded with wines that the server had chosen for us. After two/three bottles of wine, a few cocktails, and shooters, we were well on our way to an expensive bill, however to our surprise it wasn't shocking for everything we got to enjoy and a night out. The prices are what is to be expected. 

Service great, food great, therefore restaurant great. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We live literally across the street and have been wanting to come here for a year since moving in. We did last night, and it was great.

Before ever visiting, Louisiane has a really lovely vibe, candlelit seats spread along the sidewalk. It always looked very enticing, and it was, both inside and out.

The menu is southern/cajun food, which was a first for us, which was nice. We ordered a chicken soup, green salad, crab cakes, to start. And then we had the dinosaur beef ribs and sizzling firecracker shrimp as mains. We also got two bottles of wine.

Everything was really yummy, the chicken soup/green salad were good. The crabcakes / dinosaur ribs though, were amazing. The crabcakes starter comes as 5-6 small little balls which you can dip and eat. And the ribs, were honestly, some of the best I ever had in my life. 

Also, all of the staff were also super nice. I say all, because unlike other restaurants where if you ask another employee for something, they will say \"I'll get your server.\" At Louisiane, said person just did the task, happily. Which is how it is in the Europe/Australia, unlike North America etc. 

We had a really lovely dinner. Every aspect was great.

However, the one downside to this place, is that I find it is a tad expensive. Most things on the menu feel a little bit marked up than they should be, I feel. But that said, unlike many other marked up restaurants around the city, La Louisiane offers something that is incredibly unique, and executed very well. For a long time, we only stuck to going to BYOW restaurants if we ever wanted wine, because of the intense markup on bottles especially. However, because Louisiane is unique, and offers a great seating, atmosphere and food, it can be argued that the pricing is justified. I'd return for sure."}
{"text":"Cosy decor, nice staff, food is good (very spicy). A little disappointed with hushpuppies but the little bread biscuits were really good! The shrimp in jambalaya was also very good!"}
{"text":"This place has a super romantic feel, Candlelight with cozy tables. Its kept low and has big windows that look to the street, or you can sit out in the pretty terrase. The servers were extremely friendly, fast and polite. Sadly the food failed to impress me. This was my first time trying creole/cajun food and I guess I am not too big of a fan of this type, so cannot say anything about the authenticity either. However the place is right for nice romantic environment."}
{"text":"If this were an episode of Iron Chef and the secret ingredient was RUBBER, there's no doubt in my mind that La Louisiane would walk away with the grand prize. The chicken was overcooked and rubbery, the shrimp was overcooked and rubbery, the single piece of sausage in the jumbalaya was overcooked and rubbery, the sweet potato fries were overcooked and inexplicably rubbery - honestly, they'd have had the challenge in the bag! 

I could also talk about the sad side of veg or the gluggy rice, but honestly, they just weren't rubbery enough for my tastes. 

On the plus side, the service was exceptional and the ambience was top notch. And judging by the other reviews, maybe I just caught them on a bad night. Oh well, c'est la vie!"}
{"text":"Very cozy restaurant directly on Sherbrooke. offers outdoor seating in the summer time . This is a rare Cajun style restaurant in the area that offers some great dishes and great drinks as well as friendly staff and reasonable pricing. My favourite item on the menu is the dinosaur ribs , huge , tender delicious ribs that will keep you wanting more ! They also have some great chicken and shrimp dishes as well. Another favourite item of mine is the chocolate and pecan pie with ice cream , which we usually end up sharing because we're so stuffed from dinner but yet still can't resist the call of that pie !"}
{"text":"For all the variety of foods that Montreal's restaurant scene offers, I find that some of the regional cuisines of the United States are clearly absent or have next to no representation up here.

Thanks to La Louisiane at least Cajun food has a presence here, my guess is that it's due to the French connection Quebec and Louisiana both have, but even then it's always nice to see.

This place has been around forever and always seems busy. Even then, I've come here quite a few times over the years and have never walked away disappointed with anything I had. Gumbo, Jambalaya, fried alligator, Bread Pudding with Jack Daniels sauce, they've got them all here.

Service can be brisk and erratic at times but the folks are always friendly and the outdoor dining in the summertime is always pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is super cozy and really welcoming. We came for a Birthday party about nine of us and the service was very quick. Everything was spicy, I ordered the garlic spaghetti and it was spicy as well. I am not sure if I loved or hated it but everyone else's meals looked really good. I really loved the ambiance and our waiter took care of our every need. I think I would comeback again and try something else."}
{"text":"Yum! 

We ordered the sweet potato fries and onion rings which both came with cajun mayo and was delicious. The onion rings are very lightly battered and fried. I ordered Fedelinni Santa Fe with shrimp instead of chicken. It was SPICY! sweet with a kick to it.  The owner was kind enough to give me some cream's to put in it to reduce the heat a little. My sister had the shrimp creole which was good. Our friend had the ribs, I didn't try any but it looked like the meat was falling off the bone. For dessert we had bread pudding and the bananas foster. The bread pudding was so decadent, drenched in a whiskey sauce with a buttery soft texture and a crispy sugary top."}
{"text":"Good service , be careful with spicy rice ufff , all the rest was a delicious taste. Spicy smell that you will bring at home. I recomande the fried vegetables mmmm. The washroom was clean."}
{"text":"J'ai pensé que j'ai laissé un review déjà.

La nourriture est très bonne. J'espère que tu profites le cuisine épicé. J'ai eu le crawfish étouffe. C'était parfait. Très épicé. Mon ami avais le shrimp créole. Ce n'était pas trop épicé. Elle adorait ça.  Les cocktails sont populaires. J'avais le Hurricane. Très bon. Mon ami ne boit pas l'alcool. Il y a les cocktails sans alcool aussi.

Translation:

I thought that I had already left a review. I'm a few months late but remember it like it was yesterday.

The food is very good. I hope that you enjoy spicy cuisine.  I had the crawfish étouffée.  It was perfect. Very spicy (I love that). My friend had the shrimp creole which is a reasonable amount milder.  She doesn't like spicy food as much but she loved this meal. The cocktails here are popular. I personally wanted to try more but was off to drink at other places. My friend doesn't drink alcohol but there was mocktail options without alcohol.  She liked drink she had.  Also the vegetable sides are good and very fresh.

No complaints on this place. Nice atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"The outside is very discreet in a quieter section of NDG, but inside the restaurant is bustling with action, lots of tables crammed into an intimately room with the kitchen at the centre. 

Started with fried clams and hush puppies to start and had the dinosaur ribs as a main. I must say everything was quiteee spicy for my tolerance but very good."}
