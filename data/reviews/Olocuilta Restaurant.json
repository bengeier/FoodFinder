{"text":"Worst Salvadorian food I have ever had. Their service is horrible. I do not!!  Recommend this place to anyone. The waitress took our order wrong and she gave us attitude. I have been to many Salvadorian restaurant this by far, this is the worst one. They should be ashamed to call themselves a Salvadorian restaurant."}
{"text":"The chips in the beginning were a little soggy like they were a bit old. But overall the pupusas cant complain. Si pasan."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for pupusas in vegas and my family from out of state always want to come here when they are in town. The flavor is good and consistent and they are always cooked just right. The drawback is the actual dining room tables and chairs, there not too comfortable and don't fit/go along with the tables so its awkward seating if you have four people at a table. The service here is a bit slow and also inconsistent at times but the food is definitely great."}
{"text":"Wow on their popusas! If you're looking for a legit popuseria, this is the place. Can't believe we almost went next door to the taco place."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Not friendly at all and food was really bad.
They even wanted to charge me for extra forks. I don't not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had meat in a huge plastic container with a dirty bucket on top! Gross! We ended up not even eating here , the restaurant was EMPTY , but apparently the distressed lady working said sorry it will be like 35 minutes before you get food .. So we left~adios!"}
{"text":"I've been here here twice a d the food is great. This place is a whole in the wall so you don't expect 5 star service but the food is delicious. They make it nice and hot. I've had their pupusas and their spa de gallina India and both were tasty."}
{"text":"Second stop on Papusa crawl.... OMFG! Do they have magical cheese??? 10 star papusa, 4 star curtido. I had cheese y loroco. Friends had pork and cheese & bean and cheese. They have the dozen special everyday.... I so did not need to know that!!! LOL"}
{"text":"Their horchata is so good. Their bean dip and their chips are a great starter. Their pupusas are very flavorful. My favorite is the chicharron, or pork skin. They have two tip jars. One is for the mesera, or the waitress. One is for the cocinera, or the female cook. 

If you order their regular pupusas to go, you can get 6 pupusas for 99 cents each. Their specialty pupusas remain regular price. 

They make everything to order. It's delicious, flavorful, and simply good. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I like it. The staff was really friendly. They offered to explain the menu if I didn't know what anything was. I ordered for pick up and watched the staff with other customers - friendly and attentive. Cozy spot. Like any other neighborhood joint. Good food, good prices."}
{"text":"This small Salvadorian restaurant was in process of closing up so we ordered our queso spinach and queso chicken pupusas to go. These were packaged with a bag each of curtido, a spicy cabbage slaw, and a watery tomato salsa that tasted like tomato juice.  We thoroughly enjoyed our first ever pupusas in the confines of our room."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat pupusas in las Vegas can't believe how bad their food is.. they are very cheap with the amount of filling they put in their pupusas"}
{"text":"Pupusas are really good.  both orchata and tamarind drinks are delicious.  their beans dip is very nice and, one of my favorite, hen soup (soap de gallina)...very nice especially now in the cold season...
Salvadorian food can be found in many places but...THIS IS THE PLACE."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their bean and dip snack because I love chips and beans :) and the beans were delicious. But although the restaurant had only two other customers they took a very long time to bring us out one plate my bf and I were going to share. 

Once we got it the food was alright at best. It was not bad but it didn't make me want to come back again. 

Mon-fri they have a to go special but you have to order 10. 10 pupusas for $.99 cents each. Otherwise they are like $1.60 each. 

Would I recommend this place? No. Not likely."}
{"text":"Food good . But table are uncomfortable, the setting of the The restaurant is not that great. She said 50 minutes, there only 2tables with people waiting. I ask why she said there take outs too. The actual wait was 20 mints for 15 pupusas. Idk why we stayed."}
