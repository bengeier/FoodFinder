{"text":"So freaking delicious. 

Having lived in Korea for 3 years, this is the real deal. 

Shallot chicken  is my preference, but yum yum is great too. 

Not a large menu, but it is all quality."}
{"text":"I love yum yum and in my opinion has the best fried chicken in Calgary. I'm partial to the location in Airdrie because it's the original but since I was in the area I wasn't going to drive all the way Airdire. The staff are just as friendly although this location is smaller, less tables to dine at and not as clean. It's best to call and place your order and then go pick it up as they fry to order. It usually takes about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Good chicken. ..inconsistent quality. ... not a true calculation of half chicken ... they cut big pieces in half and call it a chicken piece ....overpriced for portion and quality .... will not go back"}
{"text":"Hot and crispy chicken. 
Korean food like beef bulgogi and rice. Everything is made to order. If you're in a rush, then I'd suggest ordering ahead. You can expect to wait at least 20-25 min. Just to get your food.
The restaurant itself is quite small only having a handful of tables. They have a large flat screen television inside showing hockey playoffs. (When I visited). 
Overall the food is tasty and the staff are okay. Not overly friendly, just seemed to be indifferent.
All that being said, I'll be back when I have a craving for some hot crispy tasty chicken."}
{"text":"They had a change of ownership and renovated. The new owner had zero customer service, zero idea of cooking food. This went from being the best breaded chicken to easily the worst. It took him 20 min to \"cook\" 2 thighs which he claimed was because there was a lot of bones, but clearly it's because he is frying them from frozen. It tasted of total grease, the inside was so burnt because of how long it stayed In the fryer. Then the twisted \"cheese potatos\" they should now be called the \"air and oil\" that's all you taste when you take a bite. I asked if we could get our potatos first since the chicken is taking to damn long to thaw. He simply said \"sit down please\" ignored the whole request. Also wouldn't give me an accurate ETA on anything despite us saying we are in a hurry. Will not go again and I went from advocating this place as the best chicken to avoiding it like the plague."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to place for good Korean fried chicken. Unfortunately with the change in ownership and renovation this is probably the worst fried chicken you can get. The inside of the chicken is overcooked tough and burnt. The outside is greasy and the \"fried\" batter just flakes off. I can't recommend this place anymore."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  Hubby and I walked in and I greeted the guy at the counter in Korean.  He didn't smile or say much.  We ordered a half regular fried chicken and half a shallot(scallion) chicken for takeout.  They stuffed and crammed our order into two inadequately small cardboard boxes and covered the exposed chicken pieces with red and white checkered paper.  However, the chicken is nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside (and not greasy).   I don't know what the hype about the shallot and the yum yum chicken is all about (more expensive, too)--I can slice green onions at home for less than $0.85 or $1.00 (and they'd be fresh, not wet and slimy) and the gochujang(red pepper) sauce on the yum yum chicken makes the coating too soggy to be enjoyed the next day(so it has to be eaten right away).  The best deal is to just order the plain fried chicken and add your own fixings at home."}
{"text":"I was recommended to eat at the best chicken in Calgary.  I liked the shallot chicken but the phone manners need some serious work. That's why the low score."}
{"text":"Amazing. I had the spicy chicken 3 piece meal with fries and a pop; it was perfect! It has a fantastic flavour to it. The quantity for the price was generous. The food was clean tasting and quick. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So, this place was renovated a few weeks ago and we decide to visit it. Sadly, it is no longer a 5/5. They have changed the chicken formula and the batter is not what it used to be. My friend ordered the beef plate with chicken and the beef was cold. On the quest to find a new fried chicken place.

---------------------------

5/5
Absolute hands down, the BEST fried chicken in all of Calgary. The skin is hot, crispy and spicy unless you order the original which is just as good but with less heat. I'm a fried chicken purist and don't like saucy meats. Have tried the Shallot chicken which was also tasty!!!  Tornado Potato is also fun for the kids to eat!!! It's a giant twisted Potato on a stick.... Fun novelty item!

The decor is simple. It's more of a take-out with a few small tables. In the Summer, we get our chicken and head to Bowness Park to relax and enjoy our chicken outdoors. Try this place, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Review: dine in.

Bottomline: no matter how good the fried chicken might be, the fact that we got sick after dining in there and the nonexistent service will prevent us from going there again.

Atmosphere: even though it was recently renovated, everything inside already appeared worn out. The tables were sticky and the floors were dirty. It was obvious the restaurant had no interest in maintaining its aesthetics or cleanliness. It didn't help that the guy behind the counter was absent half the time.

Food: The guy warned us about a 20 minute wait for the chicken and we should've walked out at that point. But we stayed and the food actually came out surprisingly fast. The chicken was cooked well and skin was crunchy and fresh. The yum yum sauce was good, just a tad too sweet. We also ordered the BBQ chicken combo, which was mediocre. At this point, everything would have been okay but soon after things turned ugly. Let's just say we are still frequenting the washrooms the following day.

Value: None. Paid for food that got us sick. Even if we didn't get sick, 14 dollars for half order of a whole fried chicken is average at best.

Encore? Yes but only if I'm accompanied by my nemesis."}
{"text":"I love fried chicken!!  And this place has awesome fried chicken... The best in Calgary.  Our kids rave over the shallot chicken (sadly, despite the numerous times I've taken out from here, I have yet to try the shallot chicken because there's never any left over).  I love the yum yum chicken but also have a soft spot for their regular fried chicken and their spicy fried chicken.  We've tried their spiral potatoes but the chicken is where they shine.  Not the most friendliest service but having the best fried chicken in Calgary easily outweighs the dour service."}
{"text":"The worst resto I've been to ever!!! It doesn't even deserve a star!!! Food takes like an hour to be cooked and customer service is just the worst!!! Also, the owner/manger is an asshole!!! He accused me of stealing $50 from his till and even called me late at night to threat me that he's gonna call the police on me even though he cant present an evidence that i took his $50!!! This place is trash if you want their chicken they have different locations around calgary just don't go to this one they suck."}
{"text":"Great Korean fried chicken. You can't go wrong w/ double fried goodness. Get the spicy one. Not too hot but a lot more flavour than the regular."}
