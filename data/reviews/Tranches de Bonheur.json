{"text":"Recently opened, simply great brunch place! It's in Verdun which means that you avoid the downtown area and that parking is not a nightmare... Service was very pleasant and always with a smile. The omelets were great and cooked to each one's taste. Prices are very reasonable which is always nice :))  This was a lovely discovery and we wish it all the best!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast perfection in every possible sphere. 5 stars for seriously every single aspect.   Don't let the offensively bright yellow entrance fool you: inside is a beacon of calm, warmth and comfort. Neutral colors with splashes of warmer colors to accentuate the decor meets big comfy chairs and tables of varying styles and heights. You are welcome to sit anywhere you choose and i highly recommend the low arm chairs by the cash which cradle you gently awake as the coffee sets in.   Speaking of coffee. NOT the usual typical shitty breakfast place coffee: quite the contrary actually! A beautiful delicious dark smooth java is graciously offered with each breakfast (and plate) indicating so on the menu. It is better than good until the last drop.  Service was equally impressionable with many more staff members than one would expect given the somewhat small restaurant. Friendly, well paced and welcoming throughout.   Now for the best part. The food! O.M.G. Must try everything here and I will be back again and again and again to do so. Today I had the Smoked meat Omelette plate which comes with coffee, potatoes, toast and fruit. It was so large I didn't even touch the toast and had to leave some of the deliciously seasoned potatoes with herbs behind. It was sooooooo incredibly delicious: the smoked meat was nice and juicy, the tomatoes warm but not soggy or overcooked, the peppers and onion also cooked to perfection and the omelette and brie as well, oh such a yummy blend of flavours! My friend had the breakfast poutine which was breakfast potatoes, cheese curds, bacon and sausage with fresh herbs, covered in hollandaise sauce topped with an egg and it was decadently amazing as well.   Reasonably priced for the quality and quantity of the meals, one could expect 15-20$ per person to brunch here.   Such an amazing experience, I can't wait to go back! Highly recommend! Counting on you all to help me make sure this place doesn't close so : Go check them out and support an awesome new brunch resto!"}
{"text":"What a great discovery! Had a breakfast plate with superb maple glazed merguez and exceptionally prepared home fries. So many restaurants cannot get the \"patates\" just right - crispy on the outside soft on the inside and perfectly seasoned. Coffee is also top notch. Food came quickly and served by the owner with pleasure. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The banner hung under their new sign read \"open\"(turns out was their soft opening). No matter as they seemed \"raring to go\". Their actual opening day is tomorrow - Saturday - so perfect timing for weekend brunch. It turns out they have table service so, I grabbed the high top by the front entrance.   They are located on a corner with lots of direct sunlight during parts of the day. It was a little warm next to direct sun on a hot almost fall day, but I shouldn't complain - winter is coming.  They have a nice bistroesque menu with coffees, egg dishes, waffles, salads, sandwiches, bagels, various combo plates, even poutines and desserts.   I had an excellent just right foam, just right strength, just right sized latte. The flower design was a nice touch, as I wasn't expecting it.  Warming up the semi-modern decor with super tough epoxy non-skid flooring (smart, safe and easy to clean so they say), was modern jazz. Some patrons chatted with the owners, and you could feel the vibe of this new spot (formerly Tire Bouchon) beginning to form.  My \"Nova style\" lox salad that came in a pretty large bowl (with thin sliced tomato, cucumber and white onion -  light vinaigrette, but no capers) was actually mentioned on the menu as grilled salmon. Perhaps they were out of it, though would have liked to be told as that's what drew me to order it. Hope that's just a first oversight (as I would like to try the \"listed\" dish).    The service was prompt, and attentive. The owner welcoming. I asked about the hours, and they will be standardizing them after the first days or so - in other words TBD - but surely will fit the neighborhood's needs.   With a wifi password right on the chalkboard Tranches de Bonheur is definitely shaping to be a little \"slice of happiness\", ie. a place for a good meal, or in my case a productive late lunch.   PS Boy was that a tasty latte with just the right kick - I believe it's their house blend of beans."}
