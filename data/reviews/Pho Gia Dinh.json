{"text":"I ordered tomato sauce rice and fried chicken. So good. Fried Rice already seasoned so I don't need to add side sauce. Chicken was fresh and crispy! Love!"}
{"text":"Pho was pretty good. The portions are larger than Saigon Max, PhoChandler, and Pho Saigon. The service was pretty good. We ordered spring roll and they came individually rolled in sandwich bags.  They didn't clear any of the used dishes between our appetizer and main meal. They were good about refilling our water. I will definitely come here hungrier next time. I didn't finish my pho. In fact, no one at my table finished all their food."}
{"text":"Ordered pho from 2 different waiters and my food never came out. Did nothing to make it right, won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was okay at best. Was not anything phenomenonal. The spring rolls I got were pre made which made rice paper hard on edges. Pho dac biet was expensive compared to traditional pho shops in the valley."}
{"text":"Incredible food! First time having Pho and it was delicious. This place is right accross the street from my office and I will definitely be coming back here. The chicken was Cooked perfectly and the flavor of the Pho was so rich. Service was fantastic and the place looked amazing. Everything is brad new and super clean. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"To be honest, the first time I came here was during their grand opening and I wasn't too crazy about the food. Since then, I have been back several times with friends wanting to try this place. This place is pretty good if you're looking for authentic Vietnamese dishes. Dishes here are not typical to most pho places in Arizona. In fact, these dishes are only available in Southern California or Vegas. If you are looking to try exotic and delicious dishes, do not order from their menu. The key is to order from their specials menu which is usually listed at their front door. Don't be misled by the water refill station at the counter; they will still come to refill your water. Their hot pot is great for sharing."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! The pho broth is beautiful and has such great flavor. The lemongrass beef is among the best I've ever had. Nice service, just a little slow. We will be back again...and again!"}
{"text":"I came here to grab a quick lunch before I headed out of town for some adventure. I got the vermicelli noodle with egg roll and meat. It was delicious and the young lady at the front was so sweet and also gave a 10% because it's their 1 year anniversary. The food tasted fresh and delicious and customer service was excellent! Thank you so much :)"}
{"text":"When a new Vietnamese restaurants opens up in the area I quickly rush to try it. I love different cultures and different cuisines. Especially Asian so it was a must for me. 

I would say that the location of the restaurant could be better. There aren't any major chains in the plaza. It is next to an automotive place. I would say that if they were in a busier area it would definitely get more foot traffic. 

Ambiance and Interior is simple. Very similar to most Asian restaurants. Nothing fancy or posh. 

The staff was friendly. Brought us waters right away. And took our orders.  No complaints there. 

I decided to try the Vietnamese egg rolls. The PHO and the vermicelli noodles with duck soup and bamboo shoot. 

Now I love PHO. And I thought this one was tasty. The broth was good and I would have it again. Now the rest is where the 3 star review comes from. The egg rolls were not very good and did not taste like what I am usually used to. The taste was just bland. The vermicelli noodles with duck soup and bamboo was also very bland. Just not something I would try again. 

My review is simply based on flavor. Perhaps I should try the place again. However at this time I cannot give it a higher review."}
{"text":"A friend told me the name means \"Family Pho\"...so please adopt me!

I tried the chicken with bone pho (bone = authentic baby!) and also the bo luc lac (cubed beef) over pasta (kinda strange I know but it worked!). The pho broth was bold and off the chart! Noodles were snappy and not too soft. The chicken was fresh! The beef over pasta was deeelish! Nicely grilled and not overdone. Tender and mild and the pasta had a nice sauce. The place is pretty big and good for groups. 

Service was pretty good and the waiter was very patient explaining stuff. Also, make sure you drive a Lexus cuz out front is Lexus Parking Only!"}
{"text":"I appreciate that this restaurant offers more variety than the usual pho and \"lunch plate\" rice dishes on the menu, but I would probably enjoy the food more if the bathroom is cleaner. On my last visit there, the bathroom was so nasty that I decided it really affected my dining experience and for that reason I won't come back even though I thought the food is pretty decent.  Hope management takes notice.  Pretty sure I'm not the only one that probably feel this way."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Literally the best PHO in town! Had lunch with the hubs yesterday and so glad we decided to check this business out! 

Customer service was great, the interior is decorated nicely, and there was many tables to choose from. We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and we were told to pick a table. The gentleman quickly ran over to our table and he took our drink order. (He was so nice) we looked over the menu and found what we wanted, PHO! We got the numbers 4 and 7 off the pho list and also a platter of sticky rice rolls stuffed with ground meat, tofu, and like a little side salad. 

The food? The pho tasted AMAZING and the broth was so tasty! The sticky rice rolls were really good as well and we were glad we tried it. The prices are very reasonable and the drinks are cheap! Portions are big and the food tastes GREAT! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here and the food was delicious! I'm a huge pho critic and you can always tell the quality of pho by the taste of the broth. The pho ga was flavorful and fresh. The goi cuon was quite tasty as well! Definitely a new pho favorite in Chandler :)."}
{"text":"Really never had a chance to draft them a review, but now I do. All I can say is every visit impresses me. I have tried pretty much everything in the menu sections, from Spring Rolls Appetizer to 2 people Hot Pot. Each dishes is prepared well with enough side veggies, sauces, and ingredients that usually come along with. The portion is usually big, and its big enough for me and my little one to finish.

Service is very attentive, or else you can always flag someone to ask for something easily. Prices are also decent comparing to other Viet joints"}
{"text":"Came with my father. I had Bun Mang Vit. The bowl was tiny and not enough ducks like other restaurants around town. The bowl of Pho that my dad had looked okay. Wasn't the most appealing in my opinion. The service was nice since we were one of the two occupied tables anyway. The price was around $8. I mean, for a price like that, you wouldn't expect greatest food like in Pho Thanh"}
{"text":"I ate here today for the first time because it was on the way to Jumpstreet and my nephew and his friend reallyyyy wanted to eat here.

My group of 4 was quickly seated, took about 10 mins for someone to give us a menu. There was only 5 tables taken at the time so it wasn't really busy.

The waiter and cashier were really friendly.

My nephew and his friend ordered the #1 in the pho section of the menu, I ordered the #3 pho (with beef balls) and my mom ordered some beef with rice and vegetables.

Everyone loved their food! I did notice I didn't get as much noodles as my nephew and his friend did when we all had the same size bowl.

Also for condiments on the table, they have fish sauce, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sriracha, salt and pepper. 

If I'm in the area I would go again"}
{"text":"We came from California, hungry from the 7 hours drive. Stopped in PHo Gia Dinh to rejuvenate, but the restaurant closes on Wednesdays. Owner said, come in and we'll serve you. Awesome!  Great food!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars just because the pho was some of the best I ever had. However I ordered spring rolls took one bite and they were NOT good. That itself still not a problem, after all I came for the pho, which once again was great. When the server came by and asked how things were i told him the pho was great but I would like to return the nearly untouched spring rolls for a more expensive rice dish. The server was nice and tried to fix the problem, unfortunately the owner was not. They said I had to pay for the spring rolls whether I liked them or not. I really enjoyed the pho and would have been a repeat customer, after all they are close to home, however after that I will never return. If that is how you want to run a business then post a no refund sign on the front door. So if you want to try this place I recommend sticking to the pho."}
{"text":"I've been to close to a couple of dozen Pho spots over the years, in several different states (though, many in the valley). Pho Gia Dinh is by far my favorite. Extremely friendly and welcoming environment. It's very casual and has that great small family owned vibe. The food is amazing. I've brought family members, friends and co-workers here and everyone has been glad I did. I highly recommend the Bun Bo Hue, the Ban Cahn Gio Heo, and the Pho Filet Mignon. This place is honestly one of my top three favorite places  I've ever been to eat a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Starting off, I've been eating pho regularly for about 15 years. I came here for the first time about 4 days ago, I have been back 3 times since, and was very impressed each time.
 I got the filet mignon pho, and my friends and I shared some of the sandwiches from the appetizer part of the menu. 
The meat itself was killer. Very tender, and there was a lot of it! 
Out of all of the pho I've had in Arizona, I'd say this ties for 1st place, next to un-pho-gettable. Unphogettable definitely has better tasting broth, but here, you pay anywhere from 1-2$ less, and you get a lot more noodles and meat. Now that's not me saying the broth here is bad by any means, it's very, very good. 
The bbq pork and grilled chicken sandwiches, which are only 4$, and very filling, light, not greasy, and in my opinion one of the best I've ever had. 

Highly recommend stopping by here if you're thinking about it. It's much more traditional (which I love!), and easily the best bang for your buck. Will happily be returning over and over with friends. 

Oh, and if you've never had pho before, you need to! A safe option for first timers is always the pho-tai."}
{"text":"I'm not a big reviewer, but considering this is a brand new place and I turned to reviews to make a decision, I thought I'd add my thoughts after having lunch here today.  I had the Pho Tai (#1) and it was really good, the broth was good, and the amount of beef and noodles is what I'd expect in a regular bowl pf Pho.  I can eat Pho nearly every day, and regularly have it  1-2 times a week.  I will definitely come back, and expect this place to gain traction the longer it's open.  My reason for 3 stars and not more, is the service was a little slow.  The service was not bad, in fact everyone was really kind, but it is apparent that they're new and still finding their groove.  No negative points here, just leaving a little room for improvement.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now on my parents' recommendation. They're picky with Chinese/Vietnamese restaurants and they come here a lot, so that's saying something! 

You can get iced tea (just regular tea with ice) or you can get it hot and it's free. I tried the pho the first time and it was such a big bowl! I thought it was good, but I'm not super picky when it comes to pho. The second time, I got banh cuon, which has rice noodle rolls with meat inside, fish sauce, a side of cha lua (Vietnamese pork sausage), and veggies. The rice noodle rolls were really soft and tasted fresh! 

The service was great and there's plenty of parking. There's also a decorated wall/area that would be good for photos/Instagram. Overall, the place looked very clean and the food was good. I would definitely come back and would recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"I live about a block and a half away. This location used to be a sad sports bar and lasted about a year.
Pho Gia Dinh has been a great addition to the neighborhood with the best pho I've ever had. I've tried all of the trendy places; ramen, pho... this place has the most tender tasty meat with a broth you want to dive into and stay awhile. They offer bean sprouts, jalapenos and greens along with their house-made garlic chili oil. I've heard all of their Vietnamese food is good but cannot seem to get away from the Pho filet or chicken pho. I do love the Vietnamese egg rolls too!
My neighbor friend and I end up there for lunch about once a week now and crave it more often.
Go there and get friendly, clean service with the most delicious food.
They are NOT open on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch. Not as Americanized as I like, which is why it gets 5 stars. I know it's great and my palette is just immature!"}
{"text":"So sad!! They don't know how they serve for customer. We wait for 20 mins without menu. I really get frustrated when waiters serve for another customer behind me.They don't work look like professional job."}
{"text":"Awesome. Friendly service and great food!  I will be back. There are a lot of pho restaurants in chandler but this one is a better choice."}
{"text":"I have never liked Pho, it has always been so bland to me, but I'm sick and was in need of something soul soothing. I ordered off of doordash and was delightfully surprised to open the bag to all of the fresh ingredients!! I got the filet mignon pho and it was absolutely delicious! The meat was raw, so I heated everything up on the stove and it cooked up perfectly, and the meat was beyond tender. The broth was beautifully flavored with anise, lemongrass, and basil. It was absolutely heavenly and everything I wanted and needed. Exceeded my expectations! 10/10 would recommend, and will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Took my family and they enjoyed the  authentic vietnamese cuisine. We got pho, the steak with over east egg and baguette, and some spring rolls. Everything was good and overall atmosphere was relaxed, service was very good."}
{"text":"I like this place better than all the surrounding pho restaurants.  It is clean and my Vietnamese friend recommended it to me over the others in terms of quality and flavor."}
{"text":"Ordered the banh hoi , and banh cuon and pho , banh cuon was awesome good texture and good amount ,banh hoi is rare to find other than at celebrations it was good paired with roast pork , pho was good quality of broth was sweet meat was good taste omg hopefully they can keep up the quality over time !"}
{"text":"Good , fast. Bit high for my price 10.99 ordered  dac  viet  ti go git home it does nothave that much meat . Very disappointed"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese restaurant in town .  I came here since they just open . I always get com chien hai San and it's amazing. Today , I ordered nui xao bo , i really love it. 
I would love to give them more then 5 stars ."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and nice atmosphere! Great selection of Vietnamese food and desserts.  Ran across it when I was trying to find pacific seafood buffet and glad I did. I would say it's the best Vietnamese restaurant in the valley.  Must try the basil seed and fruit cocktail for dessert"}
{"text":"Okay, I finally got around to writing this update and I am happy to say that they have definitely improved. There are so many places in this area for Pho so I was hoping the one right next to us would be our go to place when the spring roll cravings kick in. The pho is still full of flavor and everything always seems fresh when we order it. I can't comment on what it's like to actually eat in the restaurant since we prefer to take-out so I'll let other yelpers cover that bit. Staff is still friendly which is always nice and the restaurant is pretty clean so don't be afraid to try this place out."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty nice interior compared to other Vietnamese restuarants. It has a trendy interior, and this distinguishes it from a lot of other Vietnamese places. It offers a lot of the usual food options (com tam, pho) as well as few other unique items. I tried the pho dac biet, which is a pretty safe dish to order. It tasted average. My mother ordered bun bo hue, and it didn't come with huyet, which we believe is a staple of this dish! I came on a weekday evening so it wasn't busy and service was quick. Service was average for a Vietnamese place, meaning there is little interaction, but they got the job done and done quickly. The place could have been better cleaned."}
{"text":"Amazing. Come here least once a week for about a month now we have been to at least 6 other spots in the valley & this is our new favorite. They're so polite they greet you as soon as that door opens. They are constantly filling your water making sure you have what you need. The customer service makes the whole experience a hundred times better."}
{"text":"Big portions and  exceptional service and delicious food. Their place is clean too. Really good place to go to for a quick lunch as well. Definitely a regular now"}
{"text":"The pho was really good and affordable! The portion was huge and the flavoring was very authentic. They have a lot of vietnamese menu items that are for more advanced vietnamese eaters. Cant wait to go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Pho was good, but I've had better. The thing I did not like is I ordered chicken wings for my five year old and asked for no sauce and was still brought with tons of garlic sauce. The waiter said it's better that way. I explained this is for a picky five year so it is not better. I dislike when I spend my hard earned money on anything and I don't get what I ask for. I will not be coming here again. Chicken and french fries are the only thing available for kids that are picky."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since my last review, and the Pho continues to impress. 

Also, they have been making some changes to help bridge the cultural gap that led to confusion for some of the patrons (including myself). 

When I stepped inside, a server asked how many were in my party, but I'm pretty sure you can just choose a table appropriate to the size of your group if no one is near the entrance when you arrive. 

After my meal arrived, a server filled my water glass and asked if I needed anything else. They started adding less ice to the glasses to reduce the frequency of refills, and there is a server making the rounds with a pitcher of water. 

You will probably not receive a check at the end of your meal unless you ask your server or at the counter. If nothing else, you can just go to the cash register at the counter, tell the cashier your table number, and someone will ring you up without getting a check at your table. You can (of course) ask to review the bill before you pay. 

When I went to pay on my last visit, the head cook was near the counter so I had the pleasure of thanking her personally for the great Pho. She does not speak English but her daughter helped by translating. 

For those who have expressed issues having a relaxed and quiet meal with a group of friends or family during peak hours, you might want to give Saturday or Sunday lunch a try when it is not as busy. 

While I love the Pho, it is probably time for me to start exploring the rest of the menu, and I am looking forward to the adventure!"}
{"text":"Thank you for opening a great pho spot close to home! I struggle to find a place that has great broth before you add the mix-ins and this place definitely delivers. Not only do they give you a huge bowl, but they also give a heaping place of sprouts! Can't wait to try this place again!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I must be hungry or what, but the pho here taste really good. Very authentic and delicious. Fresh leaves and vegetables,
delicious broth, and tender beef slices. Awesome service and food. Spaces are very open and welcoming."}
{"text":"Wow! 

My husband and I came here late yesterday (they're open until midnight on weekends) and the place was PACKED! It took a few minutes to get our drink order in, but it was understandable why. 

I ended up ordering the Pho Tai Nam Bo Vein. The broth - my God- it was perfection! It's light, has that sweet anise flavor without overpowering the dish, and it had the right amount of salt. 

My only criticism is that it took almost 25 minutes after we finished eating to see our server again and get the check. I'm sure they will get faster once they are open longer. It doesn't matter, that wait was worth it for the Pho. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying a Pho bowl and it was great!  Nice and clean atmosphere.  Great service and great prices.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese food. To start off we both got coffees with condensed milk - so yummy. We tried the shrimp and pork rolls - I forget what they're called - and they were perfect. I got the basic pho with rice noodles and the hubby got one that had more beef in it - he is the pho expert - and he was very impressed with it. He described it as being authentic and flavorful. He and I will DEFINITELY be going back."}
{"text":"Very tasty Pho with everything in and service is very good apps ... Had the app sampler with shrimp and beef Grape leaves and spring rolls ..the grape leaves are new to me and tasty..will be back again"}
{"text":"So far so good, we came in today to try this place out since grand opening in June & wasn't so bad. We came in and wasn't busy at all. Customer service was okay, needs a lil improvement. The prices are a lil high, but overall the food was good. 4 stars for food, but 3 stars for customer service. Planning on coming back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"What a happy find- I brought my three sons here after a morning hike and we all left totally full and happy. We ordered a few of the bbq pork sandwiches and two different bowls of soup. The sandwiches were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of veggies to meat. Both soups were out standing and very flavorful. I will definitely be heading back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I hate here for the first time today I ordered the number two and she were the number six combination both bowls were less than $10 we also work with the spring rolls with pork and shrimp they were very good presentation was clean the vegetables looked wonderful the taste of the broth was very good"}
{"text":"We happened upon this place last week as we love pho and haven't found one that I was crazy over since moving to AZ from Jersey. Anyway, I was very excited to see they had food and drink specials as stated by their very large sign in the window! 

So we get inside, sit down immediately and are given menus. I look front to back and I don't see any drinks anywhere? I'm a cocktail girl, I want a lovely alcoholic beverage! So the young waiter comes over and I say, \"do you have alcohol here?\" He says, oh no sorry. So i'm thoroughly confused and look back at the window and point to it and say, that sign said you have happy hour drinks. He looks very confused now as am I when my fiance says, \" was that from the last business maybe?\" ...and the kid says oh yeah, we don't have alcohol here. So...that was a bit odd that this new restaurant has a sign up advertising daily food and drink specials.

Moving on to why i've given this 4 stars. Oh my goodness gracious, the food! Yum-O. I had the noodle dumpling soup and it was just to die for!  My fiance had a beef pho and it was equally as good. The portions were absolutely monstrous. This has now become our new #1 spot for pho. ...but please get a liquor license so I can have a tasty beverage!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pho that I've found in the Chandler area. The broth has that \"good for your soul\" warmth that just makes you feel fuzzy inside. I had the filet mignon pho, and the meat was so tender it fell apart in my chopsticks. 
The service was really friendly and fast, and everything was new and clean, but the dining room had kind of a weird chemical smell, so we will probably do takeout next time."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Vietnamese place. Food is delicious and the service is great. Just need to get the liquor license to be wonderful."}
{"text":"Went back again this week. 
Service was worse. We ordered three ordered of spring rolls, garlic butter wings, two pho tai, and one vermicelli noodles. We got the soup first. One order of spring rolls Then the noodles. About mid meal we got the chicken wings.  Then another order of spring rolls. Then once we were done, got the last order of spring rolls. So my guess was they were making rolls fresh? 
Garlic butter wings didn't have any garlic butter on them. 
Soup was still good. 
Vermicelli was good. 
Water refills are still hard to get and the cups are so small. Once we were done, no one brought us our bill. We finally got up and went to the counter to pay. 



----
New Viet place in Chandler?! You know I'm there. Walking in the place is nice and open. I saw they're working on getting their liquor license so I'm sure people will be happy. Another big thing is their hours! They're open early and close late! I hope it lasts.
Menu was large. Looks like they already made some changes because there is tape over multiple items. But I was excited to see they have the rice noodle and pork that I don't find at many places. Then of course we had to try the pho tai and we had the tamarind chicken wings. 
Chicken wings were crispy. I am not a fan of tamarind so I think I'll try the garlic butter ones or get real crazy and try the fish sauce wings next time. 
Noodles and pork was tasty. 
Soup was really good. You can just tell it was going to be good because of how clean the broth is. Not fatty at all. It was definitely one of the better pho Tai I've had. Trust me I've had a lot of bad ones. Lol. 
We will definitely be back. The only reason I didn't give a perfect five is service needs improvement. I had to ask for more water. And we never saw our server again. No one brought us our check so we finally just went up to the counter to pay."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that the broth in their mignon pho can cure sickness; it should be nominated for the Nobel Prize. The location is easy to get in and out of, the inside is clean and open, and the staff is friendly enough. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The best Pho I had in Arizona!   
I normally write reviews only if a place is really good or really bad.  I don't write reviews of 
in between service or food.     

I ended up here by mistake, I started a new job around Arizona Avenue and I was looking for 
a place to eat at lunch time.  I made quick turn to avoid traffic and ended up here.  
I was amazingly surprise, The place was clean, friendly faces and everything was already in 
the table, spoons, sauces, chopsticks. I was like  ok good.  
I asked for the Pho the number one beef Pho.  I got it in less than 5 minutes
Huge bowl, fast service and fresh vegetables.  Price was good.   
I give it 5 starts because the service was fast, the Pho was fresh and delicious, the portion 
was how I like my food, I don't like little tiny bowls of food, I'm an athlete and I burn a lot of 
calories, I can't be having little tiny plates.    So far this is the best pho I Had in 
Arizona.     I experienced something similar once in California and I love pho.  
I recommended,  Delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new pho place that surprisingly, my husband found out about before I did. I had my go-to, the Pho Dac Biet, and found the broth pleasantly satisfying, but a smidge on the light side. It was nothing a little lime juice, hoison sauce and sriravha couldn't fix. But....I have no idea how a bowl of pho could be $10.99....but that's another story. Bonuses: bright and clean place, prompt, friendly service, and there's a really cute bar area as well. Gia Dinh means family in Vietnamese and I can't wait to bring my kids here to enjoy it with me next time!"}
{"text":"Since I've been here few times & have made comments/complained, it has gotten much better.
Fresh veggies & cleanliness definitely improved severely.
Don't expect a great service or a conversation because of the language barrier.
I am impressed with the improvements!!!"}
{"text":"\"Pho was born in Northern Vietnam during the mid-1880s. The dish was heavily influenced by both Chinese and French cooking. Rice noodle and spices were imported from China; the French popularized the eating of red meat. In fact, it is believed that \"pho\" is derived from \"pot au feu\" a French soup.\" ? www.phofever.com/facts.php

Okay, the pho was excellent. It had great flavor and a clean broth but that was pretty much the only thing that was good. The egg rolls and spring rolls were okay and the bun cha was also average. The bun cha was served in a gigantic bowl but I miss the freshness of it. It still had good flavor, especially the char grilled meat, but I miss the clean feeling of eating a good bun cha on a hot as balls kinda day! It's Arizona! Give me some freshness and life!

Anyways, the place is super clean, the staff is decently friendly, and my water was refilled constantly. Prices are fair for the amount of food you're getting so I'll be back but only when I'm craving pho."}
{"text":"This is a well-run family business with a great attitude.
Their Pho Ga( chicken soup) is delicious and piping hot every time I order it.
The Mom makes a wonderful ban coun with just the right amount of seasoning and pork  .
Every time we go there it is busy ,but they always greet us with a smile and great service!
Try em out if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family because we saw it was new. We ordered their spring rolls for appetizer and it was pretty good but I noticed the lettuce was turning brown so I wondered how fresh their ingredients were. We also ordered their garlic chicken wings and it wasn't seasoned nor did it really taste like garlic. We were pretty shocked that their combination pho was like 10.99! That's probably the most expensive pho I've had in town so I had high expectations. The broth was really salty, none of us finished our broth and we all are known to finish our bowl of pho clean! There only seemed to be the round eye beef slices and there's usually another brisket or something at other restaurants but we didn't see it in our pho and I don't remember what the description said but we weren't too thrilled. We probably won't be back."}
