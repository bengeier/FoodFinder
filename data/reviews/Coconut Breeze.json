{"text":"Fried rice is better than other West Indian restaurants in Brampton. The pepper shrimp is also good despite the high price. Great customer service. This is my go to spot for West Indian styled fried rice."}
{"text":"Awesome fusion between Guyanese and Chinese foods (they mix very well.) Very reasonable prices with large portions. If I lived in Brampton, I would definitely come here often. Worth the detour if you're not from the area!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here today and hubby wanted to try it out as he heard it was good.  Overall rating on the food...not amazing but not horrible, kinda average for my taste buds.  I feel like if I went to the mall food court, could get the same tasting items there at the Chinese food stalls.  It tasted more like Chinese food than West Indian for me.  Customer service was very friendly from beginning to end.  The restaurant is more of a small diner feel than an actual restaurant.  My biggest disappointment was probably the lobster I ordered, but then again kinda my fault for setting high expectation for lobster at this kind of place as it is not a seafood specialty spot.  The spicy garlic flavour was amazing but I didn't get much meat for $28.99, got mostly fried shells.  For this reason, I had to give it a 3 instead of 4 stars.  I would still come here again for other things on the menu, just not lobster lol."}
{"text":"Inside the restaurant: very clean interior, quite modern with lively music and nice people. Came here on a sunday afternoon and people are starting to pour in. They also have a mini bar and the owner seems really nice and welcoming. Clearly, they have regular customers (they should write a review as to invite more people here)  Takeout order: mixed fried rice and special chicken fried rice. Both came to about $19, tax included  Wait: 20 minutes. Pretty long.   Taste: ive had their fried rice before and its pretty damn great though ima warn you on their hot sauce. That sht is the real thing. Its hella good and hella hot. Dont be an idiot like me and pour it all over without tasting it first.   Value: if you compare their fried rice to oceans or seasons, obviously those are cheaper. But theyre not good (seasons in general is pretty bad). Also they literally fill your container so yeah. Pretty worth.  Special: 1/2 price appetizers all day when you purchase a mix and match. Any 5 beer for $19 monday to thursday (thats a damn good deal okay)."}
{"text":"Best deal in town, 9 bucks taxes in for chicken fried rice, spring roll, chicken wings, chili chicken, veggies, and can of pop.   Great fried rice. Ridiculously good fruity hot sauce. Other food kind of reminds me of a Manchu Wok style Canadian Chinese food but whatever it's a great value and great customer service  3.5"}
{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday, and have to say the customer service is outstanding when it comes to explaining the dishes.  The food is very fresh and made to order, not reheated like some other west indian restaurants.  I ordered the chicken fried rice, wings and beef stir fry and have to say the beef stir fry was pretty damn good.  I didnt like the wings and fried rice only because im not a fan of all spice (chinese 5 spice). Although i know a lot of people like it so they may love this food."}
