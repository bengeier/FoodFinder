{"text":"This is truly excellent Chinese food.  Go with a group so you can get a variety of dishes.  Go for authentic Chinese dishes--better yet, ask your server to recommend dishes for you."}
{"text":"We are regular customers..but I hate to say they went down lately. 
Yesterday we picked chicken with Garlic sauce and Pork with Garlic sauce..literally there is no chicken or no pork in it. You can count the number of meat and need to swim through finding for the meat. They added all the crap left over veggies with it.
And they charge $8.50 for the dish. I am afraid when they are so stingy with the portion, what about the quality?
Its same-thing happened in the past few months back and but we thought lets give another try..and this time we learnt our lesson. We will avoid this restuarant"}
{"text":"Ruby's is a terrific place to go for terrific Chinese food.  I especially like their barbecue'd ribs and their seafood nest.  And plum wine!  The service is great.  If I lived in Wisconsin, I would want to eat there every week.  I for sure will eat there every time I go to Wisconsin.  Cleone from the Pacific Coast."}
