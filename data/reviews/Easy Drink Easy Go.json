{"text":"The tea is alright but the bathrooms are disgusting. Vomit-inducing, disease-carrying kind of disgusting."}
{"text":"Drinks weren't bad and came fairly quickly. I ordered a regular sized hokkaido milk tea with milk pudding for $5.20.   The cups were made of a thicker plastic so I assume they'd be good for take out if you were ordering several drinks to go.  The place was also very spacious and clean with plenty of booths for comfortable seating. Ambiance was quiet with super relaxing music almost to the point of lulling my friends and I to sleep but ideal for studying as some groups were already doing.   There was a small selection of board games and cards at the front for customers to enjoy and small snacks on their menu too.   Overall, drink wasn't packed with ice but was chilled and not overly sweet either. Pudding was smooth and tea had a nice aroma. Service was good and I would consider going again."}
{"text":"I come here to study because it's usually quiet, comfortable and usually empty.   Of course, I make a purchase every time so I've tried just about every drink on the menu.   The place is now Easy Drink Easy Go but it's the exact same thing. Nice ambience, friendly staff, good place to study, and absolutely TERRIBLE drinks.  I have never had a good BBT here, the flavours are all bland, flavourless and poorly made. You name it, original, matcha, chocolate, banana, honeydew, I could go on. Smoothie, snow cap, they all suck.   Don't come here looking for a good drink or food, order a small drink while you get zoned in on work for a couple hours with no distractions."}
{"text":"I hate to say it but this might be the worst jasmine tea bbt I've had in the city so far... the tea was very bitter and lacked any sense of a light, floral jasmine green tea (I don't normally add much sweetener to my bbt, but this one almost needed the full amount to mask the terrible burnt tea flavour). They were out of tapioca so can't comment on that, but the grass jelly is pretty meh also. I also found the service comparable to a joint run by a bunch of high school students, I literally was standing in front of the cash for a good couple minutes, none of the three people thought to address me (until one of them finally realized maybe I wanted to order a drink). The people standing next to me I think also had the same issue of these people on cash just not making any effort to ask if they wanted to order something.  Perhaps I'll give it another try with something else but skip the jasmine tea is you are used to the usual floral, green tea style ones."}
{"text":"A lot of bubble tea places have come and gone and Easy Drink Easy Go is the latest chain to open up a location in the Toronto core.  I've tried a few of their drinks which are pretty average.  I do like the number of different options available in addition to tapioca including noodle jelly.  Seating is plentiful and on a weekend evening can be pretty packed.  A lot of their games are in Chinese so we didn't end up trying them out.  The tables have buttons for ordering."}
{"text":"A nice place to rest. It's not very busy. I ordered the creamy snow cap mango green tea. The snow cap part was not very tasty. Sour saltyish. Strong green tea flavour. There is a faint flavor of mango however the drink is not very sweet. I also had the popcorn chicken 6.99. The dish was pretty small but tasty. I liked the small size of each piece. Crispy. The dark meat has cartlidge hidden in there as well."}
{"text":"I love easy drink, easy go... use to go to the finch location, which is a tiny place only for takeout"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of bubble tea, so I'd never been here before but some co-workers wanted to get a drink so we stopped by after dinner one night to check it out.   Simple and low key, and no frills decoration is the best way to describe this place. It definitely reminded me of the karaoke bars in Seoul in its decoration. We'd just eaten, so no food was ordered but from the plates stacked up to be cleaned next to the bar, it appears finger foods like grilled hot dogs and taters are on the menu. Sort of cheesy, but typically what people enjoy eating along with a sweet beverage so it works.  To get served you have a toggle at the end of your table, and the servers were quick and polite.   The soda was actually pretty good. I still can't get used to drinks with jelly in them, but flavor wise it was tasty and for a huge drink (which is described as a 'regular') it was $5. That's reasonable.  If you're a bubble tea type of person, check this place out, or drop by to try the taters and hot dogs!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came into this shop after seeing the \"special for $2.99\" signage on their store front. The shop's emptiness is a little bit turn-off, but we like to separate the experience of the product and atmosphere into two different categories.   The drinks, as mentioned in many other reviews, were bland. However, compare to the usual diabetic drinks we get from other BBT shops, this light taste was a relaxing and soothing change. Through the subtlety with light sugar, we were able to detect the aroma of their tea flavour. I believe most consumers are not capable of understanding \"good tea\" from the bad, and this is where Easy Drink Easy Go may lose many clienteles in this over-commercialized district of Toronto - an area filled with MSG and ultra sweet commodities.   If you are an avid drinking of BBT, then this place may not satisfy your conventional taste buds. On the other hand, if you're a connoisseur of TEA, then you could give them a try. Keep in mind we went for the discounted tea that may or may not be their standard tea selection for other flavours.   P.S. When you do go, please suggest having some music set up near the entrance for covering the awkward waiting in silence ambience."}
{"text":"I really like their selection of board games in this place, especially the Jenga if you can read Chinese...there are a bunch of kinda awkward questions, great to place with close friends!  The store is pretty big and they have plenty of seats, but they do get filled quickly, since the store is located in China and students like to hangout and study here.  The drinks and food are a little pricey though, which is why I deducted a star here."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner on a Friday.  When we walked in, we were just blown away by the smell of oil.  The place is pretty low key, with lots of seating.  Menu was pretty extensive, but overpriced compared to other bbt stores.  I ordered the sesame milk tea with tapioca.  They had run out of the large tapioca balls, and tapioca noodles when I ordered.  The drink was good, but nothing special.  I think I may have been put off by the lingering smell of fried foods while drinking it.  There were some games available to play, but many of them had missing pieces.  Towards the end, the smell of oil was suddenly gone, and was replaced by a floral scent.  Overall, large BBT shop with mediocre ventilation with overpriced drinks."}
{"text":"I went there on Canada Day. They had promotion for Canada 150 Anniversary which was $1.50 for regular classic bubble tea. It's a very good deal, and hard to complain anything."}
{"text":"Came here for a bubble tea fix as they had a special : $3.00 for passion fruit bubble tea.   Though the price was nice, I was thoroughly let down with their tapioca. There was absolutely no flavour in the tapioca and it was just squishy ball of nothing. The tea itself was okay. It was a pretty standard passion fruit flavour, so nothing out of the ordinary.   Their location looks nice and cosy. It could be a decent place to study with a drink in hand.   Though I was let down by the bubble tea, I may consider coming back and trying their dessert. I did, after all, get what I paid for."}
{"text":"First time trying Hokkaido milk tea- a bit too creamy and sweet for my taste, but maybe that's just Hokkaido :) read great reviews about this shop and it was cute! A great place to decompress with boba and a good book!"}
{"text":"I usually love easy drink easy go drinks! Glad to have discovered that this bigger location exists! I used to frequent the finch location. This location has seating, but most seats are empty! I'm so surprised by the lack of customers... But it means I get my order sooner lol. Oh and they have a button system so that you can have your waiter called to your table.  Anyhow today I tried the Hokkaido milk tea with pudding, snow cap mango green tea, and popcorn chicken. The tea flavour in the mango green tea is very strong and bitter! I really like that... Being able to taste the strong tea. But... the mango was sour, and mixed with the snow cap it tasted really weird...sour and salty! I do not recommend this drink at all.   My Hokkaido milk tea wasn't strong in tea flavour, but I really like the milky flavour! It's unique and is different from a regular milk tea. The popcorn chicken was tasty and the pieces were nice and bit sized."}
{"text":"this place is perfect for group hanging out or even Just with a few close friends. their drinks are AWESOME And looks so delicious. I especially love their teapot brownie."}
{"text":"not impressed! I would rather walk over to Ten-Ren, or walk a little further to CHATIME (best bubble tea in TO)"}
{"text":"Just okay. Overpriced In my opinion. Won't come back again. The signature bubble tea was okay"}
{"text":"I got the passion fruit bubble tea here and it wasn't bad. The inside is modern enough and  they have a lot of tables, some of which are big enough for groups. They also have a button on each table to call for service, which I liked. My biggest gripe is that they don't offer ice/sugar customization and they don't have nearly as many drink options as some of its competitors. I didn't get to try the food, but it looked very good on the menu at least."}
{"text":"Waste of money.   Don't bother coming here. Came here at 5 PM and it was completely dead - should have been the first sign to leave. I ordered a regular bubble milk tea (the original black tea flavor) and it was extremely diluted. It tasted like they didn't brew the tea for a long period of time and the bubbles tasted like they sat for a while because they were mushy, rather than chewy. This is pure speculation but if I had to guess they either used old tea/bubbles from the day before or continuously diluted the tea to save money since their business is dying.   Go elsewhere. $5 for a cup of tea and you gave me water with a hint of tea and splash of milk."}
