{"text":"Love it. Nice and fresh, and the sushi pizza is delicious. And I have to appreciate that they make California rolls without avocado for my too-fussy kids!"}
{"text":"BEST katsu udon boodle soup EVER. Nuff said. The secret is TRULY in the broth!"}
{"text":"The rice they give you in a bento box is the size of two sushi. You can finish it in two bites. Shrimp tempura is mostly flour. Service is really bad too. Don't even serve you water or tea."}
{"text":"Solid. Nothing really outstanding that I can think of but it's decent price for the quality of sushi. Oh, the kitchen closes really early so I've been there a couple of times and been turned away."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Friendly staff, EXCELLENT miso, good prices and portion sizes.  I eat here all the time, and only wish they were open on Sundays too!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was average but I find Japanese food mostly always pretty good and I mostly just eat maki rolls.  THis place was clean fast and friendly.  I had never seen the California roll wrapped with (what looked like) fish skin, but it was all good. Typical price, typical taste, very clean.  Go for it"}
{"text":"Great little Japanese restaurant. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The chef prepares everything with great care. By far the best sushi restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This was the worst food I have had in a while and could not eat 1/3 of my meal. The tempura and was soggy and limp, the rice was an overcooked goop. The bulgogi beef in the bento box was dry and seemed to be sitting in water (maybe it was microwaved from frozen?). The only good thing was the miso soup, which had generous seaweed and good flavor. I will never go back again though. The service was also poor, I was not offered water or anything to drink and no one came to ask how my meal was."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, price is decent, and service is very good.  The sushi is always fresh and tasty, and I love the green tea they include with every meal, even if you're just waiting for your take-out to be prepared (they serve it for you to enjoy while you wait). The green tea comes with something like rice in it, and I love it.  The price for the most part is less than a buck a piece which is my general bench-mark for decently priced sushi (unless it's AYCE aka All You Can Eat).  The service is quick and efficient, and the staff has always been polite, every time I've visited this venue."}
{"text":"Excellent little spot in Liberty Village. Biggest surprise: best miso soup I've ever had in Toronto. The sushi is pretty standard for a cheap sushi joint, and yes, like a previous reviewer, I was surprised to find my sashimi almost frozen. But to me, that's a small complaint. I plan to go back and make my way through their cooked menu, which so far I've enjoyed more."}
{"text":"Eek, I may get in trouble by my SO for writing this review as this is her go to spot on a weekly basis. I figured her patronage was more than enough reason to check this spot out and it's location is very convenient relative to Liberty Village (right at Atlantic and King W).  On a positive note, the staff are friendly and attentive and my green tea never went cold, and given the small space they're never more than nod of the head away. Also, the Miso soup was very good.  Aside from friendliness, convenience and Miso, the rolls stops here. I ordered a Sushi + Sashimi combination which came to about $24.99 all in. This came with 3- 6 piece rolls and 12 pieces of sashimi fish.  The rolls were standard fare in terms of taste, however my issue with them was in the size. The rolls were no bigger in diameter than a dollar coin. I'd expect this sort of size from a typical AYCE joint, but when I'm paying per piece I expect a little more.  Next up was the sashimi. Now for this, I had no issue with the size, as for the most part it was standard a la carte sized slices. I was happily eating the salmon and tuna when I came up on some of the other options. FROZEN. And I'm not talking about the adorable animated feature film... basically it was like biting into a frozen fish snow cone.   This furthers my opinion that a decent sushi joint in the city is hard to come by.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service and food , this is our favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto. It's a hidden gem"}
{"text":"This place is really only decent for its sushi selection. Better than the sushi boxes you get at the nearby Metro. Other than that the bento boxes are pretty forgettable. Staple place for everyone that works around Liberty Village. Might be good for team lunches because of their nice patio.  Also on Ritual."}
{"text":"To be honest we stumbled to this place cause the last 2 restaurants we picked were closed and we were too hungry to look for anymore places.  We weren't expecting much since the reviews here were meh.  Place was decent size with outside patio area.  Only 1 server, poor girl was running back and forth all day.  I got the Katsu Udon (Thanks Marc L. - you sold me) plus the $2 California roll upgrade.  In fact it was one of the better Udon I had so I was impressed.  Only thing is that they soaked my Katsu in the soup and it was all soggy after a while.  I really wasn't too confident with their raw fish. My wife however got the Sushi Bento she said the white fish wasn't fresh and didn't finish eating it but the salmon was good but the portion of the fish is smaller than other Japanese places.  Injapan is nothing to rave about but not as bad as people say.  Guess it is a hit and miss here. 3/5 stars"}
{"text":"This spot is located in the trendy neighborhood of liberty village. I ended up here as a last minute thing. It seems more like a takeout kind of place as they were surprised when we asked to be seated. Anyway the place was empty on Saturday evening (though the steady take out orders kept em busy) The menu was quite long and even had some Korean dishes.  I wanted to try both cooked and sushi items so went with a Ebi Tempura and rainbow roll. Dinning partners went for Bento Boxes (one with chicken teriyaki and other with vegetarian version of Agadashi Tofu as protein)  We were served tea immediately. I ordered a Sapparo for good measures :) My food arrived first and didn't look anything special.  I had to wait a bit till everyone got their food.  The tempura was dry and the batter was not up to par . This resulted in a much thicker batter than desired and I felt bloated after a few pieces.  The rainbow roll was just your run of the mill stuff with dried rice and fish. I would say its not much better than any food court iteration. I also tried the agadashi tofu and it was a disaster. The thick batter overpowering the protein and the sauce  just slathered over, just a gooey mess.  I think one can do a lot better for the price we paid."}
{"text":"To me is more like a 3.5 stars. The only reason why I chose 3* is because I find the menu doesn't offer nothing else that could make you explore a Japanese dining experience. Only sushi and very few sushi pizza and soups.   However, place is clean and staff is very friendly. Sushi chef and staff are all Japanese and not Chinese or any other region from Asia.   They offer dine in or take away service but not delivery.   Business hours are pretty much the same as other places with the exception of Saturday.  Mon - Fri: 11.30 am to 10.00 pm Sat: 12.0 pm to 9.30 pm Sun: closed  Sushi is pretty good, fresh and served fairly quickly. The service is prompt and very friendly.   So, overall, if you are in the neighbourhood and you crave for sushi, this is a safe bet for good sushi for a fair price if compared to the only 2-3 only options available in LV."}
{"text":"Their sushi is nothing to write home about. It's not bad but not great. But the prices are great, and I'm addicted to their udon. That's where it's at. For under 10 dollars get a bowl of sweet and savory soup."}
{"text":"I think they've updated their menu a bit over the last year as I hadn't been in a while and when I went last week I was really impressed. I always get take out, and their rolls are so fresh and tasty (better than I remember from about 8 months ago) and as others have said their miso is really good. I always have leftovers for lunch the next day and this is the only sushi I've ever had that is still just as delicious after being left in the fridge overnight. Their customer service is above and beyond, especially compared to other sushi restaurants. I'm always offered tea while I wait, and the chef usually comes out from behind the counter and gives me a freshly made hand roll (on the house) while I'm waiting for my order. These gestures combined with how delicious their food is keeps me loyal to In Japan!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to this neighborhood and we had a sushi craving.  The service was great and the sushi was delicious.   We will definitely be coming back and that in itself is the highest compliment for a restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the unagi bowl to-go. The unagi to cooked lettuce ratio was really bad - half of my meal was soggy cooked lettuce covered in teriyaki sauce and I only had five slivers of unagi. If it weren't for the friendly staff, I would've given this place a 1 star. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as people have made it out to be. We intended to go somewhere else, but when it was closed we opted to go here. They were great to my wife, two great old son and I. The food was pretty good, and while not the best sushi I've ever had, jut wasn't terrible like others have said. Their bento boxes, and tempura were good."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Very friendly staff, too. Lots of options to choose from and very convenient location!"}
{"text":"This place has probably the worst sushi (if you can call it sushi) I've ever tasted.  And I've lived in Tokyo, so I'd know.   I ordered 3 maki combo, yellow tail, scallop and spicy tuna.  They were all disgusting.  The rice was falling apart and was not properly cooked.  The fish was warm.  The scallops were Bay scallops, not Sea scallops, and there were very few of them in the roll.  The spicy sauce on the tuna was disgusting.  The tuna was chewy, rubbery and dark!  You might have better luck with their 'staple' bento boxes, but avoid ordering off their usual lunch fare as they have no idea how to make proper sushi."}
{"text":"I love this place. I probably eat here once a week (eat in or take out) and it's great.   Everyone is so friendly and helpful here, the atmosphere is great and the price is right too.   If you're in LV and want some sushi then I recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Sushi is acceptable. Nothing extraordinary, nothing bad either. Great place to grab a quick lunch but it does get busy during lunch hours. The restaurant is pretty small so if you want decent seats, go there outside of lunch hour! When we went, we ended up on the lower level underneath a stair case with low ceiling. It was an odd spot to dine.  Price wise, it's a little bit on the expensive side compared to other downtown Toronto sushi joints ($15-20/lunch). But they do make quite an effort to plate the food to make it look extra fancy. Taste wise, it's not better or worse than your average sushi place but hey, you get to take fancy shots for your instagram lol!"}
{"text":"I ordered a very simple sashimi, take out, for lunch. It's japanese cuisine 101. If you run a japanese restaurant, you should do that right.   The service was fast, so fast, SO FAST, something must have been done wrong. It was not the miso. It wasn't the green salad. I took it from the restaurant to my place, and found the problem: FROZEN SASHIMI.   I understand you have to keep your fish cold. But frozen sashimi? I MICROWAVED IT FOR 10 SECONDS TO EAT - and it cost me 15 bucks!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best sushi restaurant in Liberty Village, was my go-to when I was living there.   Not super expensive, nice portions and fast service.  Great for take out as well"}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi I have ever had in my life. Tiny, soggy rolls made with gummy rice. I had a dragon roll and couldn't even eat it. It was covered in a cloyingly sweet sauce and overly salted sauce. I felt robbed after spending almost $15 on this horrible 'food'"}
{"text":"A quick go to spot for lunch. There's nothing much to say about this place other than they serve good, quick Japanese food. If you're expecting anything more than a quick grab and go, then you're expecting too much.   They make the usual bento box combos, bibimbap meals, and of course sushi combo meals and a various assortment of maki rolls.   They mainly cater to the Liberty Village lunch crowd it seems, so best time to beat the rush is either 11:30am, or after 2pm. Although you get that cute, kitchy Japanese style vibe and atmosphere, service is semi cafeteria style, where you place your order up front, grab your seat, and wait to be called once you're meal is up.   Staff is friendly and very helpful and patient with the big crowds."}
{"text":"Every single time I get sushi here it is FRESH. Always.   I can't say that about too many places - so if you're in Liberty Village, this is the place to go.  They cut their sushi rolls into smaller sizes (YESSSSSSS!) and I'm so thankful - because I want to be able to enjoy it without it falling and crumbling out of my mouth.  They are always so great about any special requests I have, and every roll comes with a Miso Soup - how much better can it get?  Would definitely recommend.  I always keep going back.  Favourite roll: Philadelphia Roll, no cucumber with Raw salmon instead of smoked."}
{"text":"Located with a selection of other restaurants the place has a small patio out front that faces the street. Inside there is a takeout and sushi counter at the back of the restaurant with two small booths and a few freestanding tables. Decorated with orange walls and lots of Japanese inspired wood trim it also had an extensive menu that was popular as a take out place. We opted for a sushi dish and some noodles but sadly, the food was not that impressive. Given the takeout traffic we expected it to be a little better but it really was simple sushi like you would get from any fast food sushi place."}
{"text":"Decent sushi, if not the most inventive choices. It's on a lively little restaurant row in Liberty Village. Service was attentive and pleasant. The waitress knocked over a bowl of tempura sauce on the table and they gave us cute little crab rolls to compensate. Prices are competitive to other joints in the area, if not cheaper."}
{"text":"Good Comfort food.   We came here for lunch and had a wonderful meal with good service. Cute decor and clean bathrooms (in basement)  Bento Box- chicken teriyaki: big portion, came with very flavorful miso soup. Server kind enough to swap sushi rolls on my request. Tempura shrimp and yam too.  Finished it off with Green Tea ice cream (a staple).... Yum!  Don't believe all the bad reviews- its worth a try if you are in the Village."}
{"text":"I work in the W. Queen W. area, and there is a serious lack of places to grab sushi for lunch, so after some yelp searching I was excited to find this place, which was less than a 10 minute walk.  I ordered take out, and it was ready when I got there. They said 15 - 20 minutes, and it was ready after only 10 (when I arrived)... not a fan of raw fish hanging out in a bag with hot soup for too long... so that was a bit annoying.   It's about $15 for a lunch, which for sushi in Toronto is fairly high.   The food itself was fine. But, I'll be looking for another place to satiate my sushi cravings.   PS: Don't you hate when your raw fish mingles in a bag with hot soup? Don't you! yuck."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi.  Having only been there once they offered a great option for sashimi and chirashi."}
