{"text":"Very friendly staff, large tasty portions, reasonable prices, and its brand new, handy to Marlborough station so leave the car at home and have a couple of worry free pints!!!"}
{"text":"Woodys has excellent southern style bbq. It's a little bit different than your ordinary bbq food, but in a good way. The meats all are very tender and actually have a nice smokey flavor. The portions are quite generous and the staff is nice. 

If you would like a more reasonable meal go for a sandwich, if you want to try everything get the taste of Woody's. This take home won't go to waste!"}
{"text":"we went for lunch with a groupon. there was a restriction for the groupon but no biggie. the drinks were brought out and we ordered, seemed a longer wait than most for a lunchtime place. the food was very good. everything we got was right on point, so plan on this being a regular lunch stop. hopefully the timing was just a glitch that day. the happy hour and evening line up looks like fun, too."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ. The sides were tasty and the Corn Bread is spot on. Kinda did expect to get more on the plate but what I got was good good (Brisket and Pork; haven't tried the chicken yet). But the deserts....DAMN!! They do not skimp on the pieces and are delish. My buddy got the banana pudding and said it was spot on. A little annoyed that we were their at 11:30 am and we didn't get our food till 12:20 pm, especially since we were the only ones in their, but the waitress was super friendly and comped our drinks for the delay. 

Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Went back to give Woodys another shot.  This time I called to place a to go order.  Bobby answered the phone and put me on hold for literally over ten minutes.  I called back and spoke to a Nicole and asked if this was a bad time and she said no sorry Bobby is the bartender and must have gotten busy and forgot.  No wonder this place always looks dead.  So I went ahead and ordered my food.  

I ordered the baby back ribs specialty with a side of green beans and a mashed potatoes.  I arrived about 10 minutes later and am greeted by NO one.  I look into the bar area as I'm waiting like an uninvited burglar and there's Bobby chatting it up with one person at the bar.  Man it must be hard to be so busy.  Wonder what Bobby is going to do when this space closes again?  

Finally Nicole arrives and then leaves and comes back to tell me they have no green beans, not a big deal I will take some BBQ beans.  ~20 bucks later I'm home and ready to eat.  The mashed potatoes were old and on the cold side.  The BBQ beans were most definitely cold.  The baby back ribs should have been named preme back ribs.  Felt like I was eating an infant pig.  They also tasted like they had been made several hours previously.  

What a waste of money.  Our BBQ is in pretty dire straits out here.  Good luck woodys I will be shocked if you make it another year if this is your norm."}
{"text":"Worst bbq i have ever eaten. Dry cheap meat. Overcooked veggies and pinto beans with a splash of bbq sauce. Total hood bbq! H O R R I B L E!!!"}
{"text":"Update to my previous review, went back after receiving a groupon deal and was looking forward to my usual favorite sampler appetizer platter... well surprise, things have changed! The mushrooms were different from last time, besides the fact they were served scorching hot on the outside and ice cold in the middle! The once big onion rings are now small and barely any trace of onion and the portion size in general is now much smaller. When we questioned the server he says they are having to make \"cut backs\" so I guess quality is the first thing to go. It was just very disappointing since it was our 4th time going and it was consistently good until now. I will probably give it one more chance to see if anything has changed back... very disappointing!"}
{"text":"The food was good the service needed a little bit of help but it was late so maybe thats why it wasn't up to par. I liked the karaoke host and the owner was very nice too. This is a fun place to dine on Fridays for karaoke lovers. I will be back and if you go tell them Shortie sent ya!"}
{"text":"Bland. 
No smoke ring on the pork , chicken or ribs. 
Chicken had soggy skin .
Ribs were fatty and tasteless. 
Pork was good if slathered in sauce. 
Coleslaw was marginal , mac and cheese was cold , beans were ok , corn was dried out. 
Poutine was made from old fries and cold gravy. 
Definitely one of the worst BBQ places I've  been to."}
{"text":"The brisket was moist as advertised. The bbq sauces were not that great and the sides were hit and miss. The Mac and cheese was really good but the green beans were just canned and still in the juice from the can.
The cook was new and the food took FOREVER to get to us. We were pretty much the only ones in there so there's no excuse for that. The cook forgot to turn on the fryer so my friend could have French fries like she'd ordered. The desserts were fantastic and HUGE though, so they have that going for them!!"}
{"text":"Went to Woody's BBQ with my family on a busy Friday night.  The service was very slow and we waited almost an hour before the food came out.  The place was crowded.  We ordered a slab of ribs, onion rings and a combination plate with all the meats.  My wife enjoyed her dish and the slab of ribs were just OK for me.  The onion rings weren't that great.  I saw a manager yelling at a service from our table.  Don't know what the issue was but it was unprofessional.  He was really on her.  Don't think I will be back, I have a better experience at Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"The hubby and I have decided to branch out and try new places, so when i saw that Woody's BBQ offered a deal on Groupon, I thought \"Perfect! A new place AND a deal!\" I wish I could go back and slap myself. It was THAT bad. We had high hopes upon first entering. The establishment was clean and the kid manning the front was friendly and took us to our table. Our waitress came out and took our drink order and was back in less than 2 minutes with our pitcher of beer. We decided to try the Family Feast for 2, which included brisket, ribs, chicken, BBQ beans, grilled corn on the cob, fries, coleslaw, and Texas Toast. Our waitress wrote down our order and told us it would be up in about 15 minutes. We didn't see her again for the entire 25 minutes it took for our food to come out. She, along with the rest of the staff, completely disappeared from view. No one came by to check on us, ask if we needed a water refill, etc. When our waitress finally came back with our tray of food, I was instantly disappointed. It just didn't look good. The coleslaw was runny, the ribs were tiny, the chicken was BRIGHT pink, the brisket was dry, and the \"Texas Toast\" was 4 pieces of soggy white bread. We tried to eat it. We really did. And anyone who knows my husband knows he will eat pretty much anything. But after ten minutes of trying bites of each thing, we ended up just sharing the basket of fries. Another thing that bugged us was before our food arrived, we couldn't find anyone who worked there to save our lives. But while we were eating there were at least 5 employees standing near our table just WATCHING us eat (or should I say, trying to eat). It was like they wanted to gage our reaction with each bite we took. It was unnerving to say the least. After asking for the check, we gave the girl our Groupon, some cash and left. Once we got home, maybe it was that we had psyched ourselves out on how bad the food was, but neither of us felt good and we both went to bed with stomachaches. Or maybe it was just that we were still hungry since the food was inedible."}
{"text":"So we were going to La Cay for sub when we noticed woody's barbeque next-door. We went into check the menu they had a lot of lunch deals and happy hour so we thought we'd check it out she told us before we sat down it was all you could eat ribs for $27 but I decided to have Brunswick stew and Gerald had pulled pork with Okra! I should've ordered mine as a soup and sandwich deal as you get salad and cornbread with it, but I just ordered cornbread on side. Stew had corn, mushrooms, large kidney beans, chunks of meat and a nice kick, it was great and cornbread was fantastic too! Oh and had a Caesar to drink it was good too!
My husband had the pulled pork sandwich and for side he decided to pick okra as he read the health benefits on Google and they were amazing, it was good too nothing to complain about they have lots of TVs they have pool tables and it's fairly slow around 3 PM service was good and bill was reasonable. We will go back to try something else but remember $5 burgers on Thursday and all you can eat ribs on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"If this review was on our bartender alone it would be 5 stars, easy. Mike was great. Friendly, attentive, knowledgeable. This guy was everything a bartender should be. He wasn't standing at the register texting, or flirting with a waitress at the service well, he was actually talking to his customers. Mike is the reason I'll be back. 
The boy and I only stopped in for a beer and some munchies. Selection behind the bar is better than I expected it to be. They have grand canyon on tap, I always love to try something new, and I wasn't disappointed. Looking through the shelves it seemed like they had a nice selection of spirits too, surprising for a neighborhood bar. 
The menu looked nice, I don't know that I have ever seen fried okra. We had the sampler and a basket of fries. The mozzarella sticks are mozzarella sticks, they are good, but don't get too excited. All the fried fare was typical, the fries were soggy. However, the deep fried corn nuggets were new and different, I enjoyed them. We sampled their vast selection of sauces on our fries. Unimpressed. To quote my husband, since he is sitting here repeatedly asking me to do so, \"they all suck except for the Louisiana sweet\"."}
{"text":"My wife and I know the owner of Woody's. His son and our son had been friends for a long time. When they told us they would be opening a BBQ restaurant, we said would would check it out. I believe we went sometime in April. I can't remember exactly what we ate, but it was very good. The service was a bit slow. Took more then 10 mins to get drinks and then almost 40 mins to get our food. The atmosphere was nice. Wasn't a lot of people there at the time we went. Did get a chance to chat with Mr. Ken the owner. I would have loved to have gone back, but they are now closed. We saw Mr Ken with a U-Haul truck and the huge industrial stove on the flatbed. He told us why they closed, but I won't post the reasons here. It's too bad, because there are only a couple of decent BBQ places in the valley. Famous Dave's is one of them. RedRock BBQ in Sedona is awesome as well."}
{"text":"As a forever Glendale resident I too was looking forward to having a local BBQ spot super close to home. Let me start by saying there is  truth in a \"picture is worth a thousand words\". As I hung onto my comes-once-a-month-ValPac-coupon till the ink rubbed off, I took my chances even after my ooh-lets-pig-out-on-great BBQ [a favorite of ours] friend who happens to be an awesome cook told me \"don't bother\", and tried them anyway. This is America and everyone deserves a chance.

She said the portions were small and disappointing. I ordered the same and had to move a single okra to find my \"full lack of ribs\". True to the picture on my coupon, I shoulda' known then. We laughed tons about it.  She had mentioned the service was lousy, slow and non attentive, she didn't lie. I promise you, I am very patient and truly appreciate food service workers. I could never do it. Although very friendly and apologetic, our server returned what seemed days later to tell us what was now not available. Another apparent week went by before the food came, cold and incorrect at that. We kept it, didn't want to wait any longer. Couldn't really, too hungry.

The sauces on the table, four flavors if I recall, were all runny and mediocre. Meat was on the dry side and tasteless. Yay for the runny sauces. The two baked beans were pretty tasty. We ordered a to-go meal in plenty of time to coincide with our departure, that didn't work out either. I think a planet or two were discovered while we waited for it to arrive. Three of us dined that Sunday afternoon, nothing special day, very slow. Absolutely no reason for any of it. 

A.F. - We were on the exact same wave length. A single visit each and my friends and I knew they wouldn't make it. Sad really. 

Now all this may seem like a scathing review but it isn't. After one incredibly lousy visit [never had the chance to make it two] I would have definitely gone back!!!!  Even though we had to go to the bar to wait on ourselves after the first round made it's way to our table, each and every single pint was ice cold -- the world was right again and all was forgiven..."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday to try it out since the quality bbq places on the west side are few and far between.   Got the spare ribs with bbq beans and coleslaw and a side  half rack of the baby back ribs to go.  The baby backs looked good but were way over cooked, the meat was hard and tough almost like jerky.  The spare ribs weren't even grilled at all, they looked liked they were boiled, they looked gray and unappetizing.  The sides and the sauces were excelent, the slaw had a great tang to it and the beans were fantastic.  Definately will not be getting the ribs again anytime soon."}
{"text":"BBQ got to have it!  I had the half chicken tonight's special. It was delicious, moist and well cooked. Came with 2 sides so I chose fried corn on the cob & that was a new tasty experience. Other side I chose a baked spud, which was very good. Spouse had brisket and he really enjoyed it with his coleslaw & fried corn on the cob. We enjoyed a pitcher of Rickard's dark beer - which we remembered from Campbell River; on Victoria Island.  We would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
