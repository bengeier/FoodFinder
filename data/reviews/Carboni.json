{"text":"How this guy ended up in Montreal, I don't know. Seriously best slices available in Montreal. There are a handful of places in little italy with this quality of pizza, but none of them offer a slice.This guy is a serious pizza chef from Rome and has a European vibe. Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Shout outs to Laurent for brining me to this spot! The Mile End is filled with a lot of great hidden gems and this is definitely one of them. Great tasting artisanal pizza squares with a variety of flavours and ingredient combos. Great, friendly staff are there to serve you their amazing pizza. Also right next to Chez Boris if you are craving donuts as a post meal snack!"}
{"text":"This is a nice dine in or take out pizza place. It's very low key and inviting.   I found this place as I was walking out of chez boris. I almost missed it.   I got a slice of mushroom pizza to go and it was really good. Better than fast food type pizza and just as convenient. The crust wasn't too thin or thick. Sauce wasn't spilling everywhere.  Everything was good. Honestly, worth stopping by for. I don't think it's the best place to dine in because it is quite a small area and a bit dark. But for the counter pizza area, it's a go!  They also serve fresh pasta!"}
