{"text":"Barista doesn't know how to make a cappuccino. I got a full cup of coffee with a little foam on top."}
{"text":"Bleh! I only come here to get out the house when I want to use the computer. The internet speed is pretty fast and the ambiance is nice.  The morning server has yet to even smile at me, and has said as little as possible every time I come here. I've seen her be friendly with other customers. I don't drink coffee so I order tea. I've tested 4 different teas and it just does not steep well. I'm better off ordering hot water. The small selection of food that they do sell does not appease my eyes or taste buds. I just wish they sold fruit too like apples and bananas, how hard is that?  If I could walk to a Starbucks, I would go there instead."}
{"text":"I have no idea why other reviewers criticize baristas friendliness or niceness or \"chit-chattiness?\". Maybe the baristas are actually trying to do their job, serve customers and not chat all day?. Maybe some reviewers are not so much of \"people persons?\". I chatted with one barista for like 10 minutes on and off about random sh** while making sure not to disrupt other customers and orders flows. They are friendly and they brew fresh coffee. I'm not concerned about the food options here. This is a coffee shop and they use a good roast, medium and dark. I like their dark Colombian roast. All were nice. The place itself is spacious enough and perfect for some laptop work time. Comfy seats. While I'm a nerd on many subjects and lean left on many issues, I'm not a hipster. They don't bother me. I find the conversations amusing."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Sybil makes it perfect every morning. Can't eat a lot of the food there but there is a deli is next door. You can eat your sandwich in this crazy mocha and get a good coffee."}
{"text":"I love the working atmosphere of this store and the baristas are really friendly and great in my experience.  I've been coming here for years. The big windows, open plan, and bountiful power access make it a good place to park, work, and be caffeinated.  Its locally owned, which I like, too.   I'm not a fan of their \"flavors\" but the classic coffee, espresso, and tea drinks are good.    The reason this store doesn't get 5 stars is because this the can't reasonably set the air conditioning.  At any season, the store is frigidly cold.  I found myself bringing scarves and sweatshirts in the middle of the summer.  Where I would have stayed longer than an hour, I left so that I can feel my fingers."}
{"text":"Crazy Mocha should not be trusted with air conditioning.   Between November and April, this is a fine place to sip coffee and work via wifi. But sitting in this shop any time the outside temperature is above 60 degree feels like enduring some ice room challenge on \"Fear Factor.\"   The room is big, and there are plenty of windows and lots of sunshine. You won't want to leave. But eventually, you'll have to leave because staying brings the risk of hypothermia.  You think I'm exaggerating? Go sit in Crazy Mocha for more than 20 minutes without several layers of clothing and one of those aluminum foil blankets they make for astronauts and avalanche survivors. Do it. I dare you."}
{"text":"Cafe au lait was average.  What I'd expect from a local shop.  I think it was 2% milk and would recommend asking.  I don't see the point of drinking coffee with 2?.  It lacks body, mouth feel and flavor.  Had a cookie with m&m and it was huge but texture pasty and taste a bit bland and without buttery or Carmel notes.  Overall its mediocre.  Better than gas station coffee.  Not even close to top shelf coffee shops"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Crazy Mocha, and this is my favorite location. The quality of the drinks is consistent, the staff is friendly and helpful, and there are plenty of seats. The air conditioning is good inside, but there are also outdoor seating options which I really like. Parking is very minimal, but I tend to park on the street beside it right off of Baum; I noticed others doing the same. Definitely check out this location! It's very quiet and is right beside ALDI. I highly recommend the caramel iced latte - so creamy and smooth!"}
{"text":"It's not terrible, but the products are always too much sugar and the espresso is too weak. The baristas are always really nice though and always friendly. I don't mind stopping in here and there."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new branch of Crazy Mocha on Baum (opened in the last few months) located in the building right beside ALDI. I love the space. It's in a big, open building that looks somewhat industrial compared to the other Crazy Mochas. It's beautifully freshly painted with dark green and brown walls furnished with the typical chairs and small tables of the other Crazy Mochas. I've been here a few times to work with a coffee and bagel. A highlight here is that I can grab the UPitt Wifi from an office in the same building, which is particularly nice for me to be connected to. This morning I tried the Golden Pecan roast, and it was incredible! I hope all of the other branches start serving this coffee. If you're a Crazy Mocha enthusiast or simple coffee shop goer, stop in here sometime."}
{"text":"This is a very awesome place, and they feature a Monkey Mocha (traditional mocha with a shot of banana syrup), that us chimps just can't get enough of.  VERY friendly staff, and the atmosphere is open and friendly.  Prices a BIT high, and that's the only thing that keeps them from 5 STARS!!!"}
{"text":"Of all the coffee shops around Pittsburgh, this one ranks high on my list! As an avid lover of coffee and former barista, I'd be lying if I didn't say I have high expectations. Crazy mocha offers a variety of coffee, espresso, and tea options (something for everyone!) With lots of tables and more importantly, outlets, it's a great space to get some work done, or spend a morning chatting with your friends. I love the open space and natural lighting, too.   Pro tip: bring a light jacket. Sometimes very chilly!"}
{"text":"Picked up a chicken salad sandwich here for lunch, it was on an ice cold croissant, it was dry, and extremely bland. I don't recommend this place for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great coffee for great prices. Cost $11 for two large coffees (I got a mocha, my husband got caramel... something) and a giant cookie. Coffee tasted great, too! And service was very fast."}
{"text":"I like this cafe because it's a block away from where I'm staying (I'm disabled and have difficulty walking), and because the coffee is always very good and reasonably priced. The staff is also friendly towards me and my Service Dog, which is very much appreciated. I also like the mellow atmosphere. It's a very good place to meet with friends or surf the net and enjoy a hot beverage."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with the service received at crazy mocha. Sybil was the staff member who did exceptional work and went above and beyond to help me. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The staff is always so lovely, it's quiet and I love the way it's set up. Perfect for a quick stop, to work alone or to hold a business meeting."}
{"text":"Typical Crazy Mocha. Clean with friendly staff. I went on a Saturday and it was moderately busy so you could find a seat and there was also always a flow of people."}
{"text":"For me, Crazy Mocha is an ideal working coffee shop. The coffee is good and very affordable, there is no music that I've ever noticed or if there is, it is very low. It is also a large space with plenty of seating that never even gets half full. There is a small lot, at least one bike rack, and relatively easy street parking up along Fairmount and Roup. It isn't hip, and to me that is an advantage when meeting new clients because it is a very neutral space. There is a conference room that can be reserved upstairs that I've never used, but it seems to be almost always available (I'm in here ~2x/week)  On the negative: the bathrooms are of wildly variable cleanliness and there are very little drink options outside of coffee drinks (especially lacking in cold drink varieties).  If you want a more artsy coffee shop with music and exceptional coffee at the cost of things like parking and seating space, check out nearby Commonplace Voluto or especially Zeke's."}
{"text":"I came here for a meeting. I ordered a tea but something happened with the machine and the worker gifted it to me. He didn't have to do that so I really appreciated it.   There is a private meeting space upstairs that can be reserved.   There is a very small parking lot that can hold maybe 4 cars but there is also street parking.   It's a nice coffee shop with local baked goods available."}
{"text":"What a lazy barista! The condiment station was trashed. She refused to make more simple syrup. Funny that she wasn't too busy to count her tips. She seemed so unhappy!!! Worst java joint and such a shame since it's one of the only places in town. Need a Starbucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Of all the Crazy Mocha locations I've been to in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite one yet. Most locations vary by size, and this is one of the larger ones, with an array of different sized tables to work from.   Judging by the several times I have gone there, this is definitely more of a \"working\" coffee shop than a \"socializing\" one. Most people pull out their computers and work for several hours. Length of stay doesn't seem to be a problem though, size there's enough space to go around. There are some coveted long tables along the wall, but those are hard to snag.   The menu boasts most of the same items as other Crazy Mocha location, I believe they might have more prepared foods than some of the others. The coffee is nothing to complain about. I'm a chai latte girl, and they do use powder instead of liquid concentrate, which makes it very sweet.   I also noticed they have a large private conference room on the second floor. This could be really useful for people looking for a meeting space."}
{"text":"So no ice for iced beverages. I asked for a blackberry vanilla iced latte, as I have ordered in other crazy mochas and various coffee shops that carry Monin syrups .  She stared at me as if I had 2 heads and indignantly stated that there's no such thing as blackberry syrup.  I stated that this mystery syrup does indeed exist, and she then tossed the syrup menu at me and said \"oh, well different shops have different syrups\"  My husband also ordered almond syrup and he received caramel.    Crazy Mocha's identity in Pittsburgh is average coffee with consistently poor service from hipsters that could care less that you're there."}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee spot! Amazing biscotti's !! Everything is fresh and ambiance is relaxing !"}
{"text":"The coffee is ok. The space is cozy and interesting. They have a nice patio to sip on coffee and chat on nice days. I wish today was a nice day, I can't stand the cherry chapstick signature stench of Crazy Mochas. I thought it was an issue of the Shadyside store and one that's masked better in Bloomfield. In Lawrenceville it's 10X more potent. Ken, no one wants to drink their coffee in a place that smells like a restroom. Time to switch air fresheners."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many dislikes. Barista was super nice and we had 2 double shot iced americano! Tasted great so 5 stars overall!!!"}
{"text":"Only getting 3 stars because they don't have a bike rack! What's up with that??! Service is cool and the space is nice and pretty clean."}
{"text":"Cute place with a great variety of pastries and teas! There's plenty of seating (with outlets nearby) available! I hopped in here when it began pouring and had a nice ginger-lemon tea. The barista was super nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"The baristas are always nice, but they are not friendly. Does that make sense? They won't chit chat at all, and they never have a smile on their faces. That's fine, they make my coffee quick.  My biggest issue is the actual coffee. I always get a mocha, and I understand there is a fair amount of sugar in it, but it is always so damn sweet!! Actually hurts my teeth. Sometimes, maybe once a month, they get it pretty close. But most of the time, you can't even taste the coffee, just a mouthful of sweet. Gah!!! And the temperature is always lukewarm. NEVER hot enough.  I have business downtown 3 times a week, so I try to hit Starbucks there when I can. Often, I just don't have the time and have to hit Crazy Mocha once I make it back to the 'hood.  Can't wait for the day when we have a Starbucks here!! At least I always know what I'm gonna get, unlike this Crazy Mocha."}
{"text":"It's ok, nothing special.  Lackluster character, a little listless and drinks are average."}
{"text":"Amazing space. Very roomy and nice. Very friendly and laid back service. But the coffee really doesn't compare to some of the other places in Pittsburgh. My chai tea latte tasted a bit chalky... Starbucks makes it better- and that's saying something. The regular coffee is alright- they have a special where they'll fill your mug up to 20 oz for $1.40.   It's a great location as well. But if you care more about the coffee than the space I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. Colorful walls, friendly service, free internet. They are a great local coffee shop to support. I encourage anyone to try them out."}
{"text":"Now I am not a coffee drinker nor am I a neo-beatnik, but I do stop in here from time to time to get a dessert if Deli On Butler Street is out of sweets. I usually get one of their brownies which are as big as floor tiles or one of their pancake-sized chocolate chip cookies.  Each is a fine, fine, soft, chewy confection that will turn heads and invite stares. It's the pastry as conversation piece. Ingenious.  \"Where'd you get dat big ass cookie, man?\"  It always feels a little weird when I walk in here, however, as if I'm a vagrant that stumbled into a library. Aside from hearing WYEP or NPR on the radio, it's shockingly quiet. None of the customers smile. It appears that they're all trying to impress each other with what they're...reading? You know these people live for \"Missed Connections\" on craigslist.   Uh-oh. Let's hope someone didn't write about me. Nah. I don't stay long enough. I'm always in and out like a burglar."}
{"text":"Nice spot for grabbing a coffee and getting some work done. Not somewhere to stop if you're looking for food as their options are very limited, but their drinks are great! They have a lot of seating and it's always filled with lots of people on laptops or reading. Recommend the monkey mocha if you want something sweet!"}
{"text":"This is a nice location because it's bigger than most and if meeting with a group there's plenty of room. As with other locations the beverages are delicious and rival any big chain coffee establishment."}
{"text":"as the one time duke, I rate this in comparison to other crazy mocha, to which it is a rival in averageness. However, as a coffee house it is above par by a good degree. Go to crazy mocha over starbucks or peets; the coffee is great and I hear they sell other things that aren't coffee, but i wouldn't know, nor care. if caribou still inhabited the city, perhaps crazy mocha may have a rival in pittsburgh, but as it stands it's the best coffee in pittsburgh. also get go is terrible."}
{"text":"The major thing that this Crazy Mocha has going for it is the atmosphere/interior design and how comfortable it is to spend time here.  It's bright with lots of windows and sunlight (on sunny days of course) and plenty of seating in a central location.  They offer some unique options such as small sandwiches and pasta salads each week catered by Sausalito on Liberty Avenue.  The coffee is just okay - I've had better at many different locations in and out of Pittsburgh (RIP Quiet Storm) but they do offer almond milk as a milk alternative which is a huge plus and their Chai Latte (with almond milk) is divine.  I like that they offer a lot of different healthy options to offset the standard sweets and pastries such as gluten-free and vegan bars and snacks.  However I've notice that their costs have gone up since they first opened.  When they first opened I could get a medium latte (with soy milk) and biscotti for under under $5 (around $4.69) and now it's over $6 (with almond milk but it's almost the same upcharge as soy) so overall their prices have increased but I don't feel that their quality has increased with their prices.  I go here because it's convenient to where I work, but if I had a choice I'd go somewhere else on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This is their new corporate headquarters location on Baum Blvd. The menu is a normal coffee shop menu - house blend hot coffee, full gambit of espresso drinks, iced coffee, tea, ect. Food available included muffins, scones, biscotti, danishes, and a few other pastries. Some Crazy Mocha locations have gluten free pastry options, but I did not see any yet at this location. Since this location is brand new, everything is quite nice on the inside and very large, with a lot of space for quiet studying or working. It almost felt a little sparse and uncomfortably quiet, but I went pretty early in the morning so that may change later in the day or when more people are around for the school year."}
