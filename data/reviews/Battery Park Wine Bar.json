{"text":"Cool place. Awesome patio with great views of the water. Good wine, but this review is to highlight the great service. Stopped by to have lunch on the patio and when we were told that they weren't serving food yet PJ - the manager - made us a great cheese plate and picked out a fantastic Pinot Noir to go with it. Very knowledgeable and accommodating. The service alone will make you come back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I might be partial because I had my rehearsal dinner there though. They are great! I would recommend them for gatherings in the future if you need a cool space! The small plates are fun and great to share with friends. I love the atmosphere! They have a great outside patio that is amazing in the summer! I enjoy watching the trains go by and view the water."}
{"text":"Hung out on the patio one night with a bunch of friends - great sunset, great drinks, great food, great ambiance. Service was excellent. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"visited YOLO a couple of times and definitely enjoyed myself each time, the waiter/waitress was awesome, the owner came by to check to see if we needed anything and I even saw him working in the kitchen.  The bar is awesome and made my \"Special Long Island\" just the way I like......neet, extra long, light sour, light coke, salted rim with lemons....they even have a pool table for those who want to give it a go......try it you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"First time at  the Wine Bar.   Great stuff and two thumbs up on the Happy Hour prices.   Their nibbly Buffalo Chicken flatbread along with a Sauvignon Blanc was a great way to end the work day."}
{"text":"My three stars basically comes in \"value\".  The place *looks* like a 4-5star. Lots of exposed brick in an old factory, pleasing decor, lots of space.  The wine is priced a bit high. The food is actually tasty, but portions so small (even for a fru fru place).  And I'm not one of those guys who is always compaling about portion size. Example: The lamb sliders were 1/2 the size of a typical slider (1-1.5 bites each) and came only three on a plate priced at $8.  Loved the flavor though.  Service has been OK the few times Ive been. It feels like the staff is trying hard but aren't really experienced.  I hope that with a few tweks here and there this place will be a solid addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We went in there on a quiet Sunday on one of the remaining warmish days of the year.  (Cleveland's own brand of Indian Summer: sunny, fairly warm, windy as hell.)   I had the Groupon that other's ave mentioned, $14 for $25 worth of small plates.  The waitress had no problems honoring it and made so many wonderful suggestions as to which ones we should get.  The food was great, our drinks were fantastic and constantly refilled, and the view was outstanding.  I am yearning for summer to return so we can grab a seat outside on our next visit."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and location. The food was beyond horrible. Cold flatbread that looked like it came out of a box and mussles so stinky and bad that you could smell them before the plate was put in front of us. How they left the kitchen I'll never know. Never again."}
{"text":"Love the local and the view. Not exactly a food place but to their credit they don't really try to be. You won't find a great steak or blackened swordfish on the menu. The wine and cocktail selections are good and the appetizers are several steps up from \"bar snacks\" but are not a meal. Wonderful place to gather with friends for an evening or happy hour. Can't beat the lake views from the patio in summer and in the winter the indoor area is warm enough to make you not want to leave when the snow blows off the lake.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here twice only, for the monthly wine tasting dinners. OMG it was fantastic! Last night was the Veuve Cliquot champagne \"tasting\" dinner. Tasting? 4 full glasses of the best French champagne, including from a $200 bottle, plus 4 courses, for -- wait for it -- $40.  Not $40 per course, people, which is what I'd pay in Vegas for the equivalent, but $40 TOTAL. Mike (owner) and Dmitri (chef) must be insane. And YOU would be insane to miss the next edition of these Monday night wine dinners.   This is now my big date night of the month, guaranteed."}
{"text":"I'm torn! Great location, cute place, slow service and \"eh\" food. I guess that earns a mediocre three stars, right? My only experience there was for a colleague's retirement party. There was about 25 of us. Perhaps this is why service was slower but we had a reservation so I'd hoped they'd planned accordingly. The appetizers were just okay but the pizza brought out was not hot at all. The sangria was delicious and the prices were good. I'd certainly return and give it a try again!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, very cool. Almost left when I saw \"YOLO\" on the building... Trying way too hard there. But atmosphere made me stay."}
{"text":"Me and the bf went here on a Saturday night. We had a great time and amazing food. We started out with some drinks. I got a caramel apple martini which I thought was just ok but the bf really liked. The bf got a flower power beer that I liked so we switched. We also got sweet potato fries which are the best I have ever had! That adobo sauce and the sesame seeds plus the texture of the fries just brings these to a whole new level. Then I got a Maker's Apple Sidecar. We both loved this drink, just the perfect mix of Makers and the apple cider and bitters. It's all we ordered to drink the rest of the night. We also got a Special that was a beer cheese soup. It was very good with some cauliflower in it I think. We also got the lamb sliders that were just ok but the fries that they came with - wow. They were the perfect consistency and seasoning. We also had great and fast service."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service was great, the food was great and the wine was great. It's great! I think the bartender's name was Christopher and my group of girls were all in love. I can't wait to go back and enjoy the patio. It's a little out of the way for me, so I often forget it's even an option. I need to work on my memory!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give it 2 1/2 stars. Atmosphere was nice, but food for me was pretty bad. My husband had the lamb sliders with fries which he did say were good. I ordered the trout with green beans. The green beans were good, but the trout tasted worse than what you would get from a microwavable dinner. Bottom of trout was burnt, and definitely not worth the $14. We sampled the \"happy hour wine\", which was a disappointment because happy hour only consisted of one red wine and one white wine. The white wine was so-so, and the red was much better than the white. I might come back for the wine, but I will pass on the food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday after work for happy hour with a friend. The place is definitely off the beaten path in terms of location but the decor and setup was great. Very spacious and contemporary inside with a pool table. Their happy hour menu was pretty standard in terms of drinks with their house reds and whites for $4 and draft beer for $3. I ordered the potato pancakes and my friend the cheesy flat bread both were very good. She had been bugging me about getting mussels for a week so we finally got some and the broth was good the mussels themselves were not up to par. I would come back here with a date but would feel a little nervous at night given the surrounding neighborhood is not the most friendly. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on a Thursday for happy hour. They start 4-7PM and this place is basically located in the middle of Route 2 in the west side of Cleveland. You really need to know where you're going but it is literally in the back of the park. You can see the lake from their outside patio. Inside of the place is really nice. Very  up-to-date with their furniture. It's on the contemporary side; they also have a pool table in the back so nice place to just chill.   Due to my longing urge of mussels for weeks, my friend found this place with mussels so I had to go. The broth tasted good but they could have been a little more generous of the meat. When you open one, there was hardly anything but you can't really go wrong since it was only for $5. In addition to mussels, we also got their cheesy flatbread and potatoe pancakes. The flatbread had tomatoes and mozzarella cheese with the right amount of seasoning. The pancakes was crispy and it tasted delicious with their sauce.   Their rose wine called the Flying Monkey I think tasted subtle for a rainy day like the day we went. For $4, you can't really beat that either. They also have Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay as part of their happy hour wine drinks.   I'd come again only because it's quiet and different from all of the other places I've been to. It wasn't crowded so service was great. It's a wine bar so they had plenty of wine so that's a plus :)"}
{"text":"YOLO as others may refer to it has become one of my favorite spots. Spring through Fall I play volleyball on the courts next door so this spot has been frequented quite often before and after.   Great wine menu and food menu. I usually go for happy hour and Tuesday it lasts all day long. We have hit almost everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. I recommend sitting on the patio when it's nice outside but have had pretty entertaining conversations with the bartenders inside.  Happy Hour or dinner. This tucked away spot will get a thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice little patio with Lake breezes, friendly service, amazing wines and great cocktail specials. But ... the food needs to step up to everything else. I know it's an itty bitty kitchen, but if they could pull off just a few really excellent hot items that arrive at the table hot, this place would be jammed. I live close by and desperately want to want BPWB to be my go to place. Please!!!"}
{"text":"I tried reaching out to the management of this business about the indifferent customer service when I was there by myself, but none of my e-mail messages were returned.  I'm not surprised that they never gave me the courtesy of any response.  I left thinking to myself that I wished I'd walked just a bit further and patronized Reddstone, which always a welcoming, positive vibe and attentive customer service."}
{"text":"Easily one of the top ten wurst meals and service ever. Why is this place open in such a good restaurant city? Filet mignon only cooked on one side, steamed plain Brussels sprouts, salmon that tasted like it had Campbell's soup on top, potatoes au gratin that tasted like jalapeño and flour."}
{"text":"Catching the killer sunset on their great patio is truly something all Clevelanders must experience, and more than once while you're at it! Especially when you can hear the calming sounds of a train chugging by... it's picturesque.   So, I love wine. My Dad loves wine. My boyfriend loves wine. And my Mom, well, she's allergic (permanent DD!!! WOOO!), but still loves wine culture. We spend most of our family time out in Geneva scooting around the wineries and having a blast. But now, we have a great wine bar in our arsenal that brings them out this way for a similar, warm feeling.   We came two nights in a row, actually. Once on Friday with just my Honey and I, then again on Saturday night. Both nights had an overall older crowd with a speckling of young professionals. I'd say it was about a 70/30 ratio. And you know what? It was a relief! A place to hide away from newly-turned 21 year olds, hipsters and soccer Mom's from Mentor who don't get enough attention from their husbands. It's a great crowd. Saturday night boasted live music, a full house and a packed patio. I'm not sure if you can call ahead for the patio, but I'd try because in the summer months it's busy--with good reason.  Although I haven't tried much food here, I did manage to sneak a sweet potato fry from my  cousin, who was paying way more attention to scarfing his chicken sliders. I was divine and there weren't any complaints from him, either. It's likely known they have a great wine list, but I'm loving the integration of those great wines my family loves from Geneva! In fact, the owner works closely with a lot of those vineyards out there, so we get the best of both worlds!   This is just a great wine bar with an even better vibe, inside and out. And don't miss out on their insanely awesome happy hour prices. Cheap, delicious food AND house wine pours bigger than your face for $4. Melikey. Oh, and ample, free parking!!   Keep up the great work, Mike and staff!"}
{"text":"Tired of clichés?  Aren't we all.    Thankfully, BPWB is anything but.  What a welcome change of pace for a wine bar: high ceilings, cement floors, and several windows create an open and industrial setting.   I had been looking forward to checking out this semi-new wine bar for the past couple months and finally stopped by for a YP Event the other evening. Not only was this the perfect location for such an Event (there were approx. 50 of us in the side pool room), the bar is also great for groups or simply meeting up with a friend.    Oh yeah, did I mention that they have an incredible Happy Hour that runs til 7:30pm (Mon-Fri)?? $4 glasses of wine, $3 beers, and $2 off appetizers anyone?  Speaking of appetizers, I had the opportunity to sample a variety - including the pretty much amazing flatbreads.  I especially loved the arugula pesto, camembert, and grapes flatbread - yes, grapes on a flatbread. Delicious.  The BPWB is the perfect compliment to Reddstone and the growing residential community surrounding it. Basically, a win-win."}
{"text":"This past weekend I attended a bridal shower at Battery Park Wine Bar and must say I was very impressed. The space is urban chic and has lots of parking plus a patio.  The service (Heather and another girl) managed the party of 45 attentively and friendly. The food was some sort of penne pasta, cheese & baguettes, and flatbread pizzas. Everything was great, I can't wait to chill here one night with my husband and enjoy some vino, the selection looks great!"}
{"text":"There are 3 reasons you should at least make an effort to come by Battery Wine Park once if you are a Cleveland resident: (1) come play outdoor volleyball here, (2) enjoy a great happy hour or event gathering here, and (3) enjoy food!  I came here for the first time to play some outdoor volleyball. They have nice courts set up and every weekend, there are random pickup games to play. I love this play on a nice summer day for a great volleyball tournaments with friends or whatnot.  Then, my second and third time here were for different social gathering events. If you are finding a great location for a networking event, Battery Wine Park might just be for you! This place can offer anything a networking event is looking for: volleyball courts, outdoor patio, easy parking, bar, welcome/reception area, coatroom, happy hour menu, great service, high tables for standing, and seating tables!  As far as food, I've haven't had much here but here's what I can offer to you:  arugula pesto**, camembert cheese, roasted grapes, balsamic finish FLATBREAD (5): Whoever thought of this flatbread is amazing! Roasted grapes, arugula and balsamic sauce? This dish is healthy and delicious! Although my chef added a tad too much balsamic, I thoroughly enjoyed this plate.  Artichoke Dip & Chips (4): I believe this was the dish my friend ordered and it completely blew my mind! The chips were not your normal chips and the dip was not your normal dip. Regardless, the dip was so tasteful (and make sure you're a garlic fan to order this) that I am dying to order this next time I come.  Coconut Shrimp (3): It's okay.. your typical coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to the Detroit Shoreway area. They have great craft beer on tap (Roosterfish, Great Lakes, Victory and more) and the food has been great everytime. The staff is also very friendly and knowledgeable. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I learned about this place through Groupon. $14 for $25 worth of small plates. I'm a sucker for a deal. So off we went to try this place out last night with hunger pangs and a craving for a good bottle of wine.   First of all, I LOVE this space. Beautiful wine racks greet you when you arrive. Across the room at the bar, there's red brick wall, tall ceilings. It's a wonderful space to have. Surprisingly though, there weren't many people in here on a Saturday night around dinner. Hmmm...anyway..  We sat at the bar. I opened up the menu to find my favorite cocktail of all time- the Moscow Mule. It was a done deal. Wine can wait! Sadly though, this wasn't the Mule I was hoping to receive (the classic one in the copper cup). It was flat, and more like a martini. Epic fail.   Food items ordered were the Pan-Seared Trout with a side of vegetables, Scallops, and Chef's Mac and Cheese.   Like another yelper mentioned, the food came out way too fast. It was unbelievably speedy. Reheated much? I cannot prove this, and the kitchen is pretty closed off.   Anyway, the trout was ok. The veggies alongside were ok. It was supposed to come with a tartar sauce but it didn't. The scallops came with some sort of brown tangy (from lime juice) sauce over raw/half cooked spinach. Kind of odd and I didn't love the sauce. And the mac and cheese was also just ok. It was more like a creamy pasta and came with wayyy too much of that cream sauce. I was expecting some sort of Michael Symon variation of mac and cheese, but this wasn't even close. But still, it was edible. Nothing to rave about. It was just all edible.   On the plus side, we did find a new wine we liked and made note of it. I think it's worth a trip if you're in the mood to wine, not necessarily to dine. I would love to go back and check out the stellar patio that they have."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I can say for sure that the food and service is really good. They did a great job with the space (though not sure why there isn't a double door in the front because when that door opens, a rush of cold air blows in freezing all the patrons near it! This is Cleveland, remember!) Best part is when the train goes by....love it! Makes me feel like I'm in another city. Huge fan of the big garage door too that will be open, I'm told, come summer with patio seating, etc."}
{"text":"We go here fairly regularly for drinks and small plates during their happy hour.  The atmosphere is great and the patio is nice to sit on when it's sunny out. Their wine selection is a good mix of bottle and glass prices, and their cocktails are delicious as well. Food is okay, nothing to write home about., but it has always been consistently good."}
{"text":"I really dug this place.  It was my 1st time out to the Detroit Shoreway area and had I not been following a new friend I don't think I would have found this place.  It is beautiful inside and was happy we landed at a place with food since I was starving.  I got the mussels which were tasty but I have to say mussels should come with frites and I didn't want to spend the $6+ on a big thing of fries I just wanted a few dippers.  Luckily the people we were with shared their fries and they were mighty tasty.    My dude got the smoked trout which was ok, but lacked some flavor.  I didn't get wine (cause I was at a bar before drinking beer and I don't like to mix my alcohols) but the wine did look great and there was an amazing selection.  The beer choices were great too and got some IPA that I had never heard of before and can't remember now for some reason.  Our waitress was a doll and such a beauty and was seriously one of the best waitstaff people I have met in Cleveland.  Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Truthfully, my first visit to Y.O.L.O. (You Only Live Once, the bar's alias, I suppose?) was a bit rocky, but the bar had just opened, so I felt it was only fair to visit a couple more times after the expected kinks of any new concept have a chance to be worked out before forming a firm opinion.  I have been here four times, and  the past three have all been exceptional, so clearly ownership was aware of the shortcomings, and worked to address them!  First of all, one thing about this place is that the atmosphere is unique. Awesome and refreshingly unique. New wine bars are popping up a lot these days, and so many of them seem to almost be built from a template of dim lights, soft rock, warm colors. That is fine on an intimate date, but hanging out with friends at most wine bars borders on the uncomfortable. This spot has taken an awesome stand against wine-bar uniformity with a more modern, almost industrial feel, while still offering intimate areas for those looking to fall in love. The pool table on one side may seem out of place for a wine bar, but it's just another great indicator that this location is different. Losing a round of Conundrum wines over a game of 8-ball was some of the most fun I've had on one occasion, while bringing a date here to share a cheese plate on a first date was another great time of a whole different breed. Except my date, that went awful, which I can't exactly blame on the venue. \"Something for everyone\" seems to be a theme of this place, and it starts with the atmosphere, and \"sub-atmospheres\" of Y.O.L.O..   The wine selection is diverse, and manages to touch on all tastes. Some wine bars play a little too heavily into the whims of the bar manager or owner, but the selection here offers something from a lot of regions, and the selection of by the glass wines is not just a matter of \"this Pinot Noir is $8, this one is $9,\" but instead offers different expressions of each varietal. I am a big Pinot Noir drinker, and found that of their three offerings, they covered the lighter bodied, fruit forward cool weather style, a fuller-bodied, deeper warm-weather style, and an earthy, burgundy-esque expression. This holds true across the board. If there is one area lacking on the wine list, it's the lack of some of the Napa Valley higher-end mainstays, such as Duckhorn (although they carry Decoy Red Blend, which is a great value,) Caymus, Cakebread, Orin Swift, etc. This is a very small nitpick, because over all the list is spot-on, which clearly is an indication of the owner Mike's strong pedigree in the wine business. Also worth mentioning, is that the prices are VERY fair for such a great atmosphere.   The beer and cocktail list is progressive, modern, and definitely well-beyond a lot of other higher-end bars. Their draft list is especially solid, offering a good variety of micro-brews, relegating the every day domestics (Budweiser, Miller, etc.) to the bottle list, where, quite frankly, it belongs in a place like this, They offer some unique and well thought out mixed cocktails, using ingredients and liquors that are definitely contemporary and \"in.\" Once again, my very small nit-pick (and writing this review is making me feel prissy,) is that there is a lack of high-end whiskey selections, as well as imperial beers. I usually cap my meals/evenings off with scotch, and the single malt selections were a bit slim. As far as the beer, stocking some imperials such as Dogfish Head 90 minute, Stone Imperial Stout, and some strong Belgians such as Duval, Chimay, Delerium, etc. would add a lot to the list. I'll once again reiterate that for a wine bar, the beer and cocktail lists are extremely strong and well thought out.   The food of Y.O.L.O. is a large selection of large plates, which is great for because it not only offers a great selection of accompaniments to drinks, but can also form an excellent meal, since there is such a diversity of veggies, starches, and proteins. The aforementioned date was with a vegetarian, and she loved both the selection, and the food itself. She fawned over the squash lasagna and salad, while the meatballs and scallops made for an amazing surf-n-turf style meal for myself. The scallops themselves were  a GREAT price at $13 for the size and portion, and they were cooked PERFECTLY medium rare, which is very rare for scallops. Had I not still been under the impression that my date was salvageable, I would have ordered another round of scallops and buried my woes in shellfish.  Everything I have tried here has been good to great. Even the flat breads, which tend to be typical wine-bar fare, were unique, and topped heavily enough to be considered thin-crust pizza. Also worth mentioning are the house-pickled veggies, which I adore!  Overall, this place is a gem located in a great up and coming neighborhood, and gets my most sincere recommendation for something refreshingly different."}
{"text":"Stopped in here tonight, my gf and I had a living social coupon.   The atmosphere is awesome. Very dim and intimate. Super personal. They also have an area in the back with a pool table where we opted to sit.   They had a punch on special tonight, which was delicious. I highly recommend it. Only $5 all night.   We ordered a few dishes to share tonight; stuffed grape leaves, cheese mac, and an apple and Gorgonzola flatbread.   Flatbread=amazing.  Grape leaves=delicious.  Cheese Mac=noodles overdone.   All in all it was a good experience. And I would recommend it for drinks and some apps. It's definitely a cool spot if you are looking for something different."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love love love. Let's review:  Ambiance: Classy, intimate, romantic...great place to go on a date, or even go with a group of people. The patio is fabulous, with a view of the lake. Exposed brick wall, high ceilings...you can grab a table or a seat at the bar. I have never been here when it has been busy busy (which is fine with me), but there is always usually a group or two in there having a good time. There's also a pool table that's free to play, and some TVs so you can catch a sports game at the bar.  Drinks: Beer, mixed drinks, liquor, and of course, wine. Each season they change up some specialty drinks they have, and I usually try at least one each time I go. Otherwise, I'm a white wine drinker, while my boyfriend is a red. I prefer to go during happy hour, which is Tuesday all day and Wed-Fri 3pm-7pm ($4 draft beer, $5 wine, and some food is $6).  Food: I have never had a bad dish here ---the food is always so fabulous. Some things change every once in awhile. I love their cheese plate- you get several different types of cheeses with fruit, oil, and jam that I LOVE. It's pretty filling for just cheese and fruit too. Their buffalo chicken sliders: awesome. So good. If you're into fries, yolo fries are also good. I've had their smoked turkey ciabatta--so tasty, and I am usually reluctant try to ciabattas because it usually ends up being too much bread, but that was not the case for this sandwhich. I'm also a fan of their cheese bread. As I was writing this review I pulled up their menu to make sure I didn't miss anything, and it looks like they took something awesome off the menu---Latke. It was so good, if they did get rid of it, I hope the bring it back!!!  Service: It's all right. When they are busy, you can see how some of the servers get a little overwhelmed, but it's not too bad. Once while at the bar, I bought a round of shots for the group I was with. I told the bartender to make \"whatever\" for us, and he made the breakfast shot. I had heard about it but never tried one--take a shot, chase it with something else, and it's supposed to taste like pancakes with syrup. And oh boy, did it. It was so, so good. Cost about $35 for 4 shots, so ehhh, but they were good.  I def. recommend this place to anyone, even if you are not an avid wine drinker. There is a lot of construction on the surrounding streets right now as the city is rerouting the sewer system and connecting w. 73rd to the shoreway--so, at the time I write this review, you do have to take 74th or 76th to get to it. I hope the construction isn't hurting their business!!  I love this place."}
{"text":"It was my pleasure to dine here on a lovely Wednesday evening in August.  The weather was spectacular and the setting felt like the beach.  Busy, busy for a Wed eve.  The sliders were succulent and spicy and the grilled cheese sandwich was crunchy, sweet, gooey and comforting.  My compliments to chef Dimitr Ragousis."}
{"text":"When we finally managed to find this place on the outskirts of the Detroit Shoreway, we were kind of excited.  It was a cute, hidden place.  The crowd was a little on the old side, but it was an early Saturday, so we thought maybe we were the lame ones for eating dinner so early.  We ordered cocktails and waited.  And waited.  And our server felt bad and said the bar was backed up, so he brought us a glass of sparkling wine on the house, which was really nice.  We got our drinks and they were quite tasty!  We put in a food order - a flatbread pizza to start and sliders for each of us to come out after.  And then it got bad.  Like, thought I was on a testing-my-patience-for-$100 TV show bad.  We waited about 20 minutes for our flatbread.  Our drinks were then empty.  20 minutes later the server finally comes back around and asks if we want drinks and \"anything else to eat.\"  The husband didn't catch his phrasing and placed another drink order (expecting more food to be coming) and when the server finally gets back to our table - he admits that he forgot to put in the rest of our food.  He would do it now for us, but it would be another 20 minutes.  We tell him, no thanks, we're ready to go, it's been over an hour since we got our first plate of food! We're ready for the check and we want to go because we're meeting people and in a hurry.  Instead, he brings us a dessert on the house and waits another 15 minutes to bring us the check!  I understand, places get busy.  People call off. I didn't feel that that was the case here though.  The tables of dressed up old folks were getting plenty of attention from the server! And when he realized he screwed up he acted like he genuinely felt bad but hello! I've already wasted almost two hours here! And now I'm running late!"}
