{"text":"We came for the soft opening, so we knew that it might not the same experience expected from Guu.   We were quickly seated at the bar, and noticed that there was a strong hot air draft where we were seated. It was very hard to breathe and my eyes were getting dry but this was quickly turned off when the waiter noticed that I was trying to find the source of hot air. Sign of good customer service.   We ordered a variety of items on the menu including smoked monkfish liver, beef tongue and many different skewers. I really enjoyed the monkfish liver - it was actually my favorite dish of the night. The beef tongue was okay, a little chewy but good flavors. Very smokey. Upon tasting the first skewers that came out, my boyfriend commented on the temperature of the grill, that it wasn't hot enough. While I don't know much about grilling or temperatures, I trust his judgement in this area. As we received the rest of our skewers, each one had more char, and better flavor and texture.   Of the skewers we ordered, my favorites were the liver, pork cheek, and pork belly. My least favorite was the sasami or chicken tenderloin; I found it a little dry and not enough flavor.   I believe that there is great potential here at kintori, and will eventually live up to the standards set by its Guu counterpart."}
{"text":"I had really expected more of Yakitori Kintori.   The concept and the space is great but it isn't really well executed. Food is ok and the service is scattered. Portions are quite small (even for the price).   The high point of the night were drinks. I had a great white wine sangria and the Sapporo beer comes in massive steins.   We ordered a selection of skewers (some beef, pork, scallops, shrimp) to share (we were with friends but we shared in our couple). Shrimp was small and tasteless. The scallop was decent but certainly nothing special. Our beef dishes were also ok but uninspired. Tacos were boring. We had a bun sandwich thing (two different ones) that were also not very interesting. The meatball stuffed with cheese was ok but nothing that special. To be honest, there wasn't one standout dish.  Service was all over the place. I sat all night with an empty glass, hoping to catch the waitress to order another and food sort of got dumped on the table before they skittered away. It was also paced strangely - five or six dishes would come out at once and then nothing but a single skewer here and there for the next little while.    We dropped $100 on a few drinks, some food and a dessert (beer sorbet - that was NOT good). I left still hungry.   I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Extremely average, ordered the yakitori set that has the meat in it. Didn't find anything special in particular along with that expensive price tag. We liked it but not a place to come back second time."}
{"text":"Taking up the 2nd floor of Kinton Ramen's West-end locaiton, Yakitori Kintori is a small little place with just over 30 seats. Currently in soft-opening, service is still pretty snappy and food is coming out as fast as yakitori will come out. Which just means, go when you have some time to chill to some great old-school hip-hop tunes and want to relax with a drink and nibble away.  Tried almost a dozen skewers and favourites include the buta horumon (pork intestine), bonjiri (chicken tail, good in both salt and tare sauce versions), and the gizzards (salt). There's Asahi black in bottles and regular Asahi on tap, as well as a smaller selection of sakes and wines.  It's an uncomplicated space, serving some solid skewers of tasty animal bits."}
{"text":"Having visited Japan many times before, I can say firsthand that this restaurant is very authentic, it feel just like I'm in Tokyo.  The restaurant is small and on the second floor"}
{"text":"It's isn't often that I'm completely dissatisfied with the meal. Tonight we went to kintori as a party of four. Service was good as the waiters and waitresses were attentive. What is bad was the speed of delivering the food. We did an initial order of around a dozen types of skewers double orders. Each skewer took 5 to 15 minute to arrive. The food came at such a glacier pace the meal felt like small bites of snacks than anything but we were scared to order more. The entire meal took a little over two hours and the bill was only a hundred - just to show how little food we had ordered and how long the meal took. With the onigiri and shrimp skewer coming last at the 100th minute! Which isn't even a dish but some how shrimp skewer and rice ball with kelp inside warrants an almost 2 hours to preparation time. All 4 of us were still hungry we had to go to future bistro after for another plate of nachos, beer and cheesecake before calling it a night.  What a shame. The place was only half full. Not impressed and will never go back again."}
{"text":"Great food! Great ambiance! I've been here a few times now. Very reminiscent of yakatori places in Japan. The skewers are tasty. I prefer the tare sauce rather than the salt. Also tried the karrage. Fried chicken with jalapeño sauce. Very tasty. I would recommend the chefs selection for two for dates. It's fun and different. The service was great. Friendly servers always smiling.  Hipster places can learn a lot from these guys. Mediocre food with shitty service has no place in Toronto's restaurant scene.  Good job Yakitori Kintori"}
{"text":"Prior to visiting Kintori, I have only had skewers/yakitori at Zakkushi so this review will kind of be relative to my experience at Zakkushi.  I think Kintori has some specific items that they do better, especially for chicken: skin (not available at Zakkushi), wing, gizzard, cartilage etc. I also liked the pork intestine better here. The meatballs were also surprisingly tasty! I'm not usually a fan, but my boyfriend's sister wanted to try it and we ended up ordering seconds.  I personally didn't like the non-yakitori items as much. I found the rice balls to be too bland and their Kimchi bun was not very good (though I just checked and I no longer see it on the menu). We ordered takoyaki, but they brought out takowasabi instead which was decent. I also got the Chiki Chiki Don which was good, but I still prefer Zakkushi's.  Overall, an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Tried a number of the skewers and nothing was great. Most we tried lacked flavour and were not cooked particularly well. Quite a small room and the service was fine. I wouldn't go back. Much preferred Zakkushi on Carlton."}
{"text":"What a cool little place! It has a modern Japanese decor throughout. The bathroom even had a secret door built into the wall. I got a kick out of that!   I was able to try a number of new things here, including chicken gizzards and chicken liver (not my thing), and chicken hearts and beef tongue (surprisingly delicious!). I could eat the chicken wings, chicken meatballs and beef with scallion sauce all night long! The meats were char grilled to perfection.   For dessert I had green tea creme brulee which was devine!  The only let downs for me (besides the organ meats which was no fault of the restaurant, just personal taste), were the plum filled rice ball (it was quite bitter) and the Japanese omelette (it was fluffy but bland - the spices on the table helped save it a bit though). If you stick to meats you enjoy, you can't go wrong here.   All in all, great experience!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty small, and due to its popularity during the opening, it's quite busy even on a Wednesday night - reservation is highly recommended. Service is good and attentive, as per Kinton's service standards.   We ordered the Mango Mojito and Peach Fuzz. They're okay cocktails, but nothing to write home about. I agree with the previous review that the presentation was visually appealing, but I was expecting the stone plates to be hot to preserve the heat of the food. Guess they're purely for visuals. The food was just alright. The only dish I really liked was the beef tongue, but nothing else stood out. The chicken soft bone was really bland and kinda gross. To be honest, I can't even recall what else we ordered, and we just ate less than an hour ago - the food was THAT average.   Overall, not a bad experience, mainly because of the good service. The food and drinks are just average, much like the rest of the kinton chain. The bill came down to about ~$55 per person including tips and tax. Probably won't come again by choice."}
{"text":"I went here recently late on a Sunday night. The place was not even half full, which meant attentive service and only a short wait from ordering to food in my belly. We tried virtually every chicken dish, some pork and one beef. Overall, I was very impressed with almost everything (the one exception - the pork intestines had not been properly cleaned and were gross) and I'm excited to return."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of skewered food, I couldn't wait to try it out.  I made my way there for late dinner during their soft opening.  Tako Wasabi (marinated octopus with wasabi) - $5.00 I can't resist getting this every time I'm at a Japanese izakaya... Love the tender pieces of raw octopus and the kick from the wasabi!  Tako Ajillo (octopus in sizzling garlic olive oil) - $7.00 This dish is served with toasted slices of baguette bread.  I really liked this as it was rich and the octopus was soft and tender.  My boyfriend, however thought it was way too oily.  Dekitate Tofu (tofu prepared at your table) $7.00 This is very very soft tofu, served with pepper, salt and sauces right on your table.  Give it about 10 minutes to cook, then scoop it up in your individual bowls and enjoy with some seasoning.  It's a nice break from the meat skewers that is salted & sauced.  Kitsune Udon (deep fried tofu & udon noodle in dashi broth) $7.00 We both really enjoyed this udon dish.  Unlike typical udon dishes, the perfectly cooked noodles are INSIDE 3 dee- fried tofu pockets (aka yubu).  Such a creative idea and really delicious as well. I highly recommend this!  The food was great - not too salty or overly seasoned and priced well.  There's nothing worse than overpriced skewered meat... lol.  And as with all of KINKA family restaurants in the city, the staff is super helpful and attentive.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"I took my family here for Mother's Day  and it became my new favourite yakitori restaurant in Toronto! I instantly fell in love with every dish I ordered and I can't wait to go back for more.   I definitely recommend the kintori set (8 skewers of chefs choice) for $19 - it's way cheaper than ordering the skewers separately! None of the meat were chewy and they were all very tender! If you are into spicy food, the Japanese green pepper char-skewers will be your best friend (they are hot tho so watch out if you can't handle spicy).   The service was also phenomenal!  Can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"I would have given 4-stars but the extremely slow and forgetful service brings it down to 3.5 stars. We had a group of 8 people that arrived right when it opened at 5pm. This is not a good place for large groups unless you show up at opening and snag a seat.   The gave us a 2-hour limit for dinner and drinks, but they ended up forgetting a bunch of our skewers and not adding the alcohol to the bills (luckily we're nice and reminded them). This was my first yakitori experience and it wasn't bad (aside from the service mix-up)  Nice presentation with the stone platters and flavoured salts. The udon pocket thing was really neat; same the random chicken body parts. The sake selection is good too (tending to the fruity flavours) and I really enjoyed the super black sesame ice-cream for dessert. Ordering $40 worth of skewers is still not filling enough for dinner alone, but better as a fancy snack with drinks.  Amazing decor that matches the Kinton downstairs. There's even a secret unmarked \"ninja door\" that hides the bathroom.   I suppose the slow service was due to new resto wrinkles that still need to be ironed out...the entrance to the yaktiori place is hidden INSIDE the Kinton."}
{"text":"Kintori!!! Oh yes, it must be read with the three exclamation marks behind it. It's part of the Kinka Family chain group, you see; another sister restaurant to the raucous Guu Izakayas. Like, a darker & cooler Guu sister that smokes...meat on a grill.    Yakitori in its literal translation is meat, but Kintori has veggies and other proteins on charcoal-flame licked skewers too.  The most surprising veggie standout for me was the Tokyo scallion, where the milder tastes comes to life through the charred, black grill lines.    The meats still make up the major part of my meal though, since there's a much bigger meats menu.  They're all good, expertly and carefully watched over and turned over with precision.   A couple of things to watch out for if you're a somewhat squeamish eater: the reba/Mennonite chicken liver is served rare on the inside, so don't order it if the idea makes you wanna toss cookies.  If you like it though, it's pretty awesome, especially when it's cooled down and takes on a silky texture.   Second, the bonjiri.  What's up?  Chicken butt.  No, for realsies, it's the tip of the chicken tail slash literal chicken butt.  It has a sort of rubbery texture that only chewing on pure fat will give you.  I'm fine with it, but if you're used to a low-calorie diet, it may groce you out.   Last tip: You may want to sprinkle some of the sea salt served on the side on some of the skewers.   The only thing that deters me from giving Kintori 5 stars is the price.  I wish it were just a little less than the $2-3 per skewer range, considering the price of meats in Canada are not that high (in comparison to Tokyo anyway).  That said, you can literally see the hard work in the boiling hot kitchen though, so I consider it mostly payment for the service which is the case for eating out anyhow.  This won't stop me from coming back though.  See you there?"}
{"text":"Since I had such a great time at the tastings at other Kinka Family restaurants, I was happy to be invited to Kintori Yakitori. I mean....who doesn't love food on a stick?!    It is located above Kinton Ramen, just east of Christie Station on Bloor. It's got lots of seating in booths or at the bar that overlooks the kitchen. The bathroom is kind of hidden, you just push on the wall until you find the door. Heehee. Luckily, if you have any accessibility issues, you can order Kintori Yakitori food from the ramen place on the main floor! And if you get a ramen craving while upstairs enjoying yakitori, you can order there as well. Win!    The skewers and charcoal are imported from Japan and you can absolutely taste the difference. It has a menu with lots of variety, for those adventurous or not. There were some foods at this tasting I had never had, but I tried everything!  We started with Chicken Original Soup and Oshinko Moriawase. A delightful chicken broth soup with scallions. It was perfect for a cold day. The spoons they gave us were so cool, I wish I'd got a photo. The second appetizer were assorted homemade Japanese pickles. There were 2 varieties and they were crisp and delicious. The cucumber pickles were sweet and the other were more...ummm...for the lack of a better word...branch-y. I'm not sure what veg they were, but I ate them all!    Next up was our first foods on a stick. Negima(chicken thigh & tokyo scallions) and Zuri(chicken gizzard). The chicken thigh was tender, juicy and let the charcoal flavours shine. I will order this when I come back. Yum! Ok, so now for the chicken gizzard. It was a little chewier than I'd like, similar to steak grizzle, but not quite that tough. Other people there loved it though. They made me feel like a newbie!    The Nikumiso Kyabetsu(cabbage salad) and Tebasaki(chicken wing) arrived. The salad came as cabbage leaves with housemade chicken miso dip, it was a nice light course. We needed one like this, there's a lot to go! Then it came...the best chicken wing I have EVER eaten. If you order anything when you're here you ABSOLUTELY MUST order this. It's crisp, juicy, flavourful and the charcoal strikes again. I cannot say enough good things about this chicken wing. All you could here was Mmmmmmmm collectively over the whole crowd.    Back to food on a stick with Uzura Kuchi Age(panko breaded quail eggs) and Premium Gyu-Tongue(beef tongue). Some more new things for me to try. The deep fried eggs were really good! A little greasy and not too eggy. The panko breading was perfect. The beef tongue tasted beefy and was slightly chewy, just chewy enough to let you know it's not regular beef. It was quite tasty.    Still more to come, we were given Tsukune(chicken meatballs) and Hatsu(chicken hearts). The meatballs were great, nice seasoning and that charcoal flavouring just makes everything even better. Chicken hearts were not what I expected. They were meatier than I thought they would be. Had the chicken texture, but didn't taste fully chickeny. It's hard to describe. Again, everyone loved them!    Time for Reba(chicken liver) and Asparagus(deep fried, panko breaded wrapped in bacon on a stick). I've had beef liver before, so that's what I expected it to be like. The flavour was quite similar to beef liver, but the texture threw me. It wasn't as firm, not mushy though. The asparagus was a little greasy and I didn't really notice the bacon. The panko gave good flavour and the asparagus was cut in perfect, bite-size pieces. You really CAN put anything on a stick!    From here, we received Negi Shio Gyu(beef with scallion sauce) and Dashi Maki(Japanese omelette). The beef was tender and juicy. The scallions gave it a great flavour and they did not hold back on them. The egg was ok. Not special after all of the other dishes we tried. At this point we were so full and we still had dessert coming. Oh my stretchy pants!    For dessert, we had Yaki Onigiri(rice ball with plum) and Houki Cha Brulee(green tea crème brulee). The rice ball was too heavy a dessert after that tasting. I could only eat a few bites. The plum was sour and the rice was crunchy. Never had a dessert like this before. The crème brulee was perfect. Usually, the custard only has a hint of its flavouring, but this tasted just like green tea. The great finish.    The staff here, and all Kinka Family locations, are friendly, welcoming and provide great service. They're happy to answer any questions about the food. I will be back to this location to get more chicken wings and taste more of their menu."}
{"text":"The newest one of the kintori restaurants, came here when they first opened and came back with some friends after a Sunday funday around downtown, was lucky to get a table right away, and a nice table at that, perhaps it's cuz I got the bench side of the table any not one of the \"chairs\" (how do you even call it a chair) it's  good to come if u want to have a drink or two have some food to snack on, not really a place you go if ur super hungry. The workers are super friendly and really Japanese (as they are at all the kinton family of restaurants)  Place is small but it works for now, very nice decor and nice lighting. The selection is good and they have a special daily menu."}
{"text":"So I get it, this is a fairly new place and there are some issues to iron out. Service is very friendly, but definitely lacking. Had to call the waitresses over for every little thing and ask for water twice before finally getting it.  I waited with my friend for the other pair that was joining us, and ordered the brussels sprouts and okra. I understand that they're $1.90 and it's a really low number. But there were only three brussels sprouts halves on a single skewer and three little chunks of okra. Really, it's a brussels sprout and a half on a stick with some sauce, and I don't understand why you'd consider that an order of anything.   When our party arrived, I ordered the Kitsune Udon for $7. It's comprised of three fried tofu dumpling-type pouches filled with udon, which are perfect. They sit in a decent but tiny amount of broth. I would actually call this a fair price, but there's still just something lacking. My friends ordered some skewers, spending around $15-20 each, and were disappointed with the portions. The quality seemed fair, except for the chicken wing, which I was told was \"gross\". One would need to spend a lot of money in order to be full.   The bill came with four little teensy semi-frozen grapes. We popped over to Tacos Al Asador for a taco-treat afterwards.   I really want to like you, Yakitori Kintori. You're cozy and I like your ambiance, and everyone's so goddamn friendly, but the food just doesn't measure up. I'm sorry."}
{"text":"Located above kinton ramen, the place is cozy with a nice izakaya atmosphere. It has almost the same feel as kinton.  I was expecting a feast of flavorful skewers a la Japanese but I was disappointed to find only blend meat skewers only good because of the sauce or salt they came with. Also the lack of vegetable selection really lowers kintori appreciation as I would expect this from true Japanese yakitori.  I don't think this food experience is worth the money."}
{"text":"This place is the parody of a real restaurant. When the dishes come out, it feels like being on a prank show. I am unsure if this restaurant was intended for human customers because the portions are so freakishly small.   Perhaps this is a restaurants for hamsters.   By skewer they mean a toothpick with 2 or 3 slivers of meat. It just makes no sense to serve food in this manner. I ended the night with hundreds of tooth picks around me.   Maybe it would be worth the hassle if the food was awesome, but it isn't. It is boring.... At least I think it is.... Each skewer was so tiny you can barely appreciate the taste.   Five stars if you are a hamster. One star if you are a human."}
{"text":"My GF and I were in Korea Town the other night starving looking for a decent place to eat and we stumbled upon Kintori, Originally asked her if she wanted Ramen and surprised to see that we ended up eating sticks of meats. We couldn't decide what we wanted so we opted for the $35 chefs choice menu. be warned that you get a lot of food and the portions look small but when you think you're done the server just keeps bringing more food.   would I come here again? Yes I love yakitori because of the size it's more of a tasting vs a meal."}
{"text":"The noodle bar is on the first floor but the Yakitori is on the 2nd up the stairs.  I like this place and as far as yakitori goes I am a fan of these types of servings and choices.  The menu breakdown is by skewers, fuller dishes, other small plates and what makes it fun is you can mix it up and try different things without going all out committed on one type of food.  While I didn't have beef this time around I did go with a couple kinds of skewered chicken, a pork belly bun and a basket of boneless spicy fried chicken (kaarage).  Even though we split our bills if some of the orders happened to be in common they'd put them all on one plate even though one would be mine and another somebody else's at the table.  We'd find ourselves asking what some of the things were so we'd know we'd be taking our own orders as well.  Things were moving and plates kept coming so we were having to keep up with our orders and we had 6 at our table.    A couple things about the upstairs, if you sit at the bar you can see the chefs working right in front of you mind you there is a glass partition.  The washroom is through a \"secret\" door at the back that looks like a wall LOL... You can tell where to push because the handplate is there.  It is however for reasons of the law marked as an \"EXIT\" as well... you know through the door you can't tell is really there.  Next time I think I'll do a variety of skewers and maybe indulge in some Wagyu beef too.  The Karaage was ok, but I've had better.  I liked the pork bun a lot.  I like this place and I will come back here..."}
{"text":"Mmm chicken! @yakitorikintori  A couple of things I love about this place.  1) Head to Tail chicken (and some pork and beef) including fun things like knee cartilage, gizzard, and tail (aka butt)  2) Service was excellent. Seems like they have improved based on reviews from when they first opened.  Each order came at a really good pace just as we finished the previous one, Deep Fried things took a little longer 3) can make reservations! For both the tables or bar.  4) somehow with all the bbqing in such a small space the ventilation was amazing. Couldn't smell a thing unlike some places I walk in and it's a wonderful charcoal smell but get stuffy and hot.   Prices are good. At around $1-2 about skewer it wasn't heartbreaking to just order more whenever we wanted. Best is one skewer per type for every two people. More sharing makes the experience not very fun.   All the skewers we got were just with salt,  although good the charcoal flavour didn't really come through (supposed to?). Nonetheless, all really good.   We also got the Karaage. It was wonderfully juicy chicken piece doused in the perfect amount of batter. We actually got it twice because she mixed up my nonkotsu karaage with this one. We didn't resolve it because it was quite good.   They also have specials with larger plated $5-8. Got a grilled whole squid. Highly recommended. They also had my favourite fried kimchi udon from Guu.  Yum.   For dessert there is a roasted green tea brulee $5 which was everything you would imagine it would be. And ice cream including a sake vanilla (get this!), beer sorbet (tastes like beer slushie) , black sesame. (also favourite)  and match green tea. Ice cream come in two scoops. It was my friends birthday and they gave us a great dessert platter for $12 which had the creme brulee and one scoop of each flavour.   It quiet (compared to guu) in here but lively enough to have a nice vibe. For our meal 4 people we spent about 20-30 per person and was full up."}
{"text":"The concept is clear and perfect. Skewer pieces of meat, (poultry, swine, or bovine) hold them above burning charcoals, Crisp the edges and fatty bits, flip and turn until medium rare, set on slate and serve. The steps are undeniably simple, but the execution and creativeness is tricky. So when it's done right and in front of you, it's commendable.  Yakitori Kintori delivers on its promise of serving delicious and delectable morsels of meat and veggies on skewers. Perfect accompaniment to beer- the salty, juicy tastes of meat turn from good to great with every bite.  I ordered many things between two people and that's another positive about Yakitori, trading and sharing skewers. We tried different things like Japanese Yum (thought it was yam misspelled but it actually wasn't. It was still a potato-like-root), chicken oysters (aka. Chicken testicles), chicken tail (aka. Chicken ass), and etc. It can be a bit overwhelming as well because they serve literally every part of a chicken or pig from the menu, conveniently and anatomically illustrated with arrows to names-  balls are under here, ass back here and soft bone... here?  My favorites were the chicken testicles, duck breast, and tail. Lesser favs still worth trying were the Sasami mentei-mayo (which has nothing to do with sesame, in case you wondered), thigh and cheese meatball. On top of the yakitori are other options with rice and noodles or un-grilled like the octopus with wasabi. Everything I had I liked and the variety made the experience delicious. My advise is to try weird things and to see what is delicious before ordering doubles or triples. You'll be surprised with what you may fall in love with.  Pro tip: pass on the beer sorbet, as I mentioned in person while eating, \"Only somewhere like Guu can they serve this and have people accept it,\" otherwise it's just frozen shards of beer - bitter after taste with the only hint of sweet coming from the small dollop of whip on top.  Pro Pro tip: make a reservation because they take reservations.   Overall, I really like Yakitori Kintori. It carries the Guu empire in the right direction not only in atmosphere and space (which is similar to it's first floor sister Kinton) but also flavors and awesome traditional Japanese food done in a unique way. Delicious and affordable, new and exciting come to mind after eating here.  I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"\"Sitting down, we paid a bit more attention to the bar area overlooking the grill. The kitchen bar decoration included a few pieces of stacked charcoal and dark slates used as plates.\"  \"The plum wine reminded us of sherry - maple nose, a bit strong and alcoholic, slightly sour and perfect to lighten and soothe the warm atmosphere, especially as it came served on the rocks.\":\"  \"We really enjoyed our evening of skewer adventures. It was impressive that we had almost every part of an animal on a stick - heart, liver, tongue, gizzard, wings, you name it - a tad disturbing and at the same time rather sustainable. \"  Just a few bites of our full review.."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here on Saturday night. It's on the second floor above a Kinton Ramen location. Reservations can be made online either through Yelp or their website. We had an early dinner at five, but at 6:30 when we left, it was getting busy.  The space is small with table or bar seating options. Decor wise, it's minimalistic - black walls and floors, it's a lot quieter than other izakaya's in Toronto.   The menu is not too large, but they have a good selection of yakitori. I also ordered other items including a rice bowl, karaage, grilled squid and dessert. With our second order of karaage, I asked for the jalapeño sauce. The fried chicken is already flavourful so save your $0.50 and don't order it. As for the meat skewers, I really liked the tsukune and negi Shio Gyu (love the scallion on it). To finish out meal, we ordered the Hojicha Creme brûlée and gobo brownie; skip the latter as all I could taste was the gobo (isn't dessert supposed to sweet?). The yakitori is a little on the higher side so it can easily add up though.  Kintori Yakitori is certainly not a cheap eat, but a great place to try some Japanese tapas and enjoy some Japanese draft beer.  Good for: dinner, tapas, Japanese, groups"}
{"text":"Hmm....delicious meat on a stick and cold sake...there isn't much to not like about this place! You can definitely get carried away ordering $3 skewers but oh man are they tasty. We like to order the vegetable sampler plus a half dozen meats...that plus a bottle of Junmai sake makes for a great dinner. A few our favorites are: negima; chicken hearts; wagyu beef; pork belly; momo.  It gets super busy on the weekends, try and make a rez or you'll end up at the counter"}
{"text":"Really quiet on a weekday evening, we made a reservation but didn't need it as we were the only customers our whole stay.  I ordered the Wagyu Beef skewer (~$9), Cheese Tsukune skewer (meatball with cheese ~$3) and Yaki Onigiri (char-grilled rice ball with teriyaki sauce with kelp filling $3)  It was my first time trying wagyu beef so I didn't have a point of reference, but the beef doesn't melt in your mouth, it's still pretty chewy. It's somewhat \"spongy\"/ fatty because it's not overcooked, and has a slight charred taste. I don't know much about meats, but the texture and flavour is similar to tenderloin, tender and meaty. For me, the skewer was okay, I don't think I'll pay again for it, I didn't find it much different than your other cuts of beef.  The meatball and yaki were both super greasy! The cheese in the meatball was some sort of aged cheese so it has a bite to it. The rice was in an odd oblong shape, not triangular, and the texture is quite sticky. There wasn't much flavour inside, despite the kelp filling.  I'm not impressed with the greasiness of the dishes. I recommend going downstairs to the 1st floor and getting Ramen instead or go to Manpuku for better yaki   On the plus side, great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very nice and authentic place with decent selection.  We ordered two sets: the $35 Omakase and the $20 Kintori set.   If you are a \"fussy eater\" best to ask what is the chefs selection.  Some people may not enjoy liver, heart and a bunch of other internal organs etc.  Of course you can order individual skewers like less exotic chicken wings, beef, onion,  brussell sprouts.  The food is good but typical of these menus, not overly filling and the cost can rack up if you don't order a couple of bowls of rice (in my case Oyako Don for $7)  The decor, service and environment is top notch!  For me it was an added plus is that I can talk to my guests since it was relatively quiet in the restaurant.   Definitely recommended.   Suggest that you make a reservation since the seating area is not overly big."}
{"text":"Perhaps it is unfair for me to put kintori up against yakitori I had in Japan but lack of yakitori shops in the city and my yearning for that simple yet smoky and balanced taste of chicken pieces I once had back in tiny 'hole in the wall' yakitori shops in Japan forced me into kintori.   First I think $$ sign by yelp is quite miss leading. I'm a small eater yet for me to get full in this place with a pint of beer will easily cost me $30-40.  Items are cheap but you will have to order ALOT to get full for this reason.    This is by far the most fancy schpancy yakitori place I've ever been to yet highly priced items are not quite living up to its expected quality.  Wings probably were my favourite but the inclusion of wing tip was bit of a disappointment and big part of the skin being very soft and mushy was not impressive.  What happened to crispy skin from charcoal grill people?  A separate order of chicken skin was crispy but it had undesirable chicken smell to it and my wife was immediately taken aback.  Pork belly was little too dry considering how succulent it can be when cooked right,  which isn't at the level of rocket science and same as chicken thigh pieces.  Tacowasa was good though but being in a yakitori place,  I expected to be semi {at the very least} blown away by yakitori of at least few items but I left the place,  once again defeated with disappointment which led me to get online,  and order me an electric yakitori grill straight from Japan off of eBay.  I think when it comes to yakitori,  Ju Izakaya by j-town up in Steeles and woodbine still holds its own.  Little pricey but I still can't forget the wings I had there.  Simply amazing!   I wouldn't recommend kintori for anyone with slightly higher than average expectation from having had yakitori in Japan or at some decent places in major cities of North America.  But if you must try,  don't go here to get full,  but may be in half empty stomach.   If any of you guys know of good yakitory places in the city, could you please send me some recommendations?  Counting down the day I get my grill. Woot!"}
{"text":"I like this place! Came here to have some \"snack\" on a Sunday night and it wasn't so busy so we were tended by a really nice waiter and even escorted us out once we were done dining. For sure this place has awesome customer service!  The menu itself is quite self explanatory. You order how many per sticks of a type of meat you want and there is also alcoholic drinks to go with it should you want to indulge.  I'll be definitely coming by here again. I would give them 5 stars but I havent tried their other stuff yet. But good atmosphere nonetheless:)"}
{"text":"Not a bad restaurant. Everything came really fast (literally dish after dish), but then again, they're just skewers so that may be why. The food was delicious, especially the ox tongue! They specialize in skewers (yakitori) but they also have other dishes like udon. We were there early so it was quite quiet and empty, but it filled up fast. Reservations is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Kintori is the Yakitori joint of the Kinka group (which also owns JaBistro, Guu(now Kinka) Izakaya and Kinton Ramen). Kintori is located on the second floor of the building. Their specialty is yakitori, japanese meat skewers.  We ordered a combination skewers and tapas. Nothing really stood out to me and thus overall it is an OK. The bill came out to be around $30 per person."}
{"text":"My bf and I ordered pork belly yakitori along with bacon with enoki mushrooms and beef with scallion sauce to share. My boyfriend ordered Yakitori Don, grilled chicken skewers on rice, and I ordered Karage Tamago Toji Don, deep fried chicken with egg on rice. The pork belly and bacon with enoki yakitori tasted pretty good. The beef with scallion sauce was really tough and hard to chew through. My boyfriend said his Yakitori Don tasted alright, nothing special.   Everything came out on time except for my rice dish. I patiently waited until 30 minutes had passed (30 min after everything else came out). I asked our waitress when my rice would be coming out and she said shortly. Finally after 1 hour of waiting, my rice was served. My boyfriend had already finished eating and so I was eating by myself. On top of the wait, my food was so bland I had to ask for some soy sauce to give it flavour. We were extremely disappointed by the long wait and bland flavours."}
{"text":"I really like the whole package that Kintori offers.  It is about how inexpensive or expensive it can be, based on what you order.  There are options of inexpensive ($2) and expensive snacks (approx $10).  The rice and noodle, meal entrees that fill you up, are generally inexpensive.    I came to Kintori with a big group.  While I only had one premium tapa ($9) and one yakitori don ($7), other people ordered many things.  From what I could see, they looked well made.  The fried chicken wings looked so deliciously saucy.  The beef sashimi on salad looked healthy.  The presentation of every dish was pretty.  The two items I had were fresh and tasty.    The restaurant is nicely decorated.  I enjoyed my experience of sitting here with a group.  The waitress didn't bother us.  I think Kintori is a good place for a reasonably priced casual date.  Food alone: 3.5 stars.  Overall 4 stars."}
{"text":"Notes: Reservations are highly recommended; MUST get the dekitate tofu, sake cheese fondue and kitsune udon.  The space barely has more than 50 seats. We reserved a table at 5pm because we had plans in the evening and were laughing at how silly that seemed....Who even eats dinner this early? But upon arrival we noticed that every. single. table. was reserved and suddenly we were very glad that we had decided to book. While we were eating, we noticed many groups being turned away because reservations took up the restaurant - even bar seats were reserved!   As their logo is a chicken (while Kinton's is a pig for pork!), their main skewers consisted of chicken parts. Now, I say chicken parts because there is really no limit to what they skewer from the chicken. Rare finds include: chicken tail, chicken oyster (ie. chicken testicles), chicken gizzard and chicken neck. Most chicken and pork skewers range from $1.30 - $2 but the beef skewers range all the way up to $9 for a Wagyu beef skewer  Yakitori Kintori grills their skewers using Binchotan technique which is a traditional Japanese charcoal that burns at a very low temperature for a longer period. This results in less smoke from the charcoal which is perfect (and much more preferred) for indoor restaurants.  ON TO OUR FAVOURITE DISHES OF THE NIGHT:  - KITSUNE UDON ($7 for 3) deep fried tofu & udon noodle in dashi broth This was one of the most unique dishes of the night! We were really confused when the dish came because we ordered this expected a bowl of soup udon. Imagine our surprise when we realized the udon is actually wrapped in the deep fried tofu and served in a delicious dashi broth. Adored the presentation of it all and it was really odd biting into a tofu and getting a mouthful of noodles instead.   - CHICKEN KAARAGE ($6) skewered deep fried chicken  Guu's karaage never fails to impress and this karaage fell nothing short of our expectations of Guu's.  - DEKITATE TOFU ($7) tofu prepared at your table This is a MUST ORDER. We were really excited to try this dish because the tofu is prepared fresh tableside. Not only is the dish fun because they prepare it table side but holy cow, this tofu is the softest tofu I have ever eaten. It is served with a white salt and a smoked salt, which was absolutely HEAVEN. Give the tofu 10 minutes to cook, then scoop it into your bowls. A really nice break from meat and fish.  - NONKOTSU KAARAGE ($5.5) deep fried knee cartilage This is another of our family favourites - we LOVE chicken knee cartilage. While this was really good, we were missing the distinct crunch from the cartilage. But we would order this again in a second.. In fact, we were going to if we weren't so full!  - HOUJI CHA CREME BRULEE ($5) Green tea creme brulee A definite recommend! The tea-flavoured is unreal and does not taste like the artificial tea you typically taste in supermarket green tea ice cream . It really, really tastes like a cup of tea. Very enjoyable and ended our meal on a very sweet note.  - BEER SORBET ($5) Sapporo beer sorbet For beer fanatics, this is your saviour. It is a very strong taste of beer with the same bitterness. Very refreshing and enjoyable but it is not for everyone. If you're not the type of person to drink beer, you probably won't enjoy this.  There were some hits and misses but we will definitely be stopping by Yakitori Kintori again. Service is on point but it is more of an eat and go restaurant rather than a long lengthy dinner like JaBistro. This is NOT the place for a bunch of hungry men. Like Guu, while each plate is cheap on its own, it is very easy to rack up the bill. I actually overheard a party of 2 saying they were eating at YK for a light snack before heading to Kinton Ramen downstairs for their ramen!"}
{"text":"The 1 star reviews are plain ignorant and moronic. If you don't understand how a yakitori japaense restaurant works...you probably should leave your opinion out of a review. Yes, they are small dishes...that is the point. Have you hear of \"tapas\" or \"appetizers\" either? Anyways, this Yakitori is located right above the delicious Kinton Ramen (which you can also order from here), and is delicious. Everything we ordered was quite flavorful and extremely satisfying."}
{"text":"*You can order ramen from Kinton Ramen (which is downstair) *The skewers are grilled over binchotan (white) charchoal. Binchotan is extra special because it burns at a lower temperature than regular charcoal but lasts longer. *offers many other proteins and vegetarian choices as well - thus there is something for everyone here.   -Chicken Original Soup The chicken original soup was actually the same broth that Kinton used for their chicken ramen. Despite its simplicity, I thought the soup was a great way to start the meal as it was light and not too fatty.  -Oshinko Moriawase (assorted housemade Japanese pickles) This was my first time having pickled burdock root and I have to say, I'm a fan! With a pleasant crunchy and meaty texture, the pickle had a distinctive sweet flavor that was similar to lotus root.  -Negima (chicken thigh & Tokyo scallion) The grilled chunks of scallion provided a slight sweet and smoky contrast to the tender and juicy chicken thigh   -Zuri (chicken gizzard)  The chicken gizzard was lightly salted and well-cooked. To describe the texture of the gizzard can be quite difficult, I would say the meat had that irresistible chewy, bouncy texture yet crunchy at the same time.  -Nikumiso Kuybetsu (cabbage salad with housemade chicken miso dip) The cabbage itself was bland, however I thought it was the perfect vessel to hold the salty chicken miso dip!  -Tebasaki (chicken wing)  The chicken wing was done just right at Kintori Yakitory with a crispy charred skin yet still remained juicy inside.  -Uzura Kushi Age (panko breaded deep-fried quail eggs) With each bite of the quail egg, you are getting some satisfying crunch from the panko crust. The sweet sauce complimented perfectly with the eggs and I thought this would be a nice snack to pair with beer to combat the grease.  -Premium Gyu tongue  if you would like to try organ meats and don't know where to start, I recommend trying beef tongue! The nice thing about tongue is that it is less organish than liver. The texture is quite soft and if you really pay attention while chewing, there seems to be a slight taste that is distinctive to tongue, but I'm pretty sure if you didn't know any better you wouldn't notice it  -Tsukune (chicken meatball) The meatballs was \"fluffy\" and juicy, and with the sweet & salty caramelized glaze, the tsukune became incredibly addicting.  -Hatsu (chicken heart) Did you know that chicken hearts, although slightly high in cholesterol, are rich in essential B vitamins and minerals?! These were tender with a surprisingly subtle red meat taste. In texture, they're softer than you might expect, with a hint of bounciness!  -Reba (Chicken Liver) While the salty and sweet glaze was delicious, the texture of the chicken liver was a bit strange and I was not a fan of it. The liver became powdery and foamy once it hit your tongue.   -Asparagus (panko breaded deep-fried asparagus wrapped with bacon) WHO DOESN\"T LOVE BACON  -Negi Shio Gyu (beef with scallion sauce) While the beef was well cooked, the star of this dish was the strong scallion sauce which provided just enough heat and sweetness to the skewer.  -Dashi Maki (Japanese omelette) While I heard some people voiced how bland this was, I thought the dashimaki was the perfect way to end the meat-heavy courses! The omelette had a slightly sweet yet still savory flavor, and it still remained moist and soft!  -Yaki Onigiri (char-grilled rice ball with plum filling and sweet teriyaki sauce) Since the rice ball was grilled, the onigiri had a subtle smokey flavor that only toasted rice can offer. The texture of the yaki onigiri was almost crunchy, yet chewy on the outside and soft on the inside. I loved how there was a nice contrast between the pickled plum and sweet teriyaki sauce of the filling.  -Houji Cha Brûlée (roasted green tea crème brûlée) Is there anyone else who get so much pleasure in cracking that caramelized sugar to get to the smooth, rich cream beneath the creme brulee? I know I do! The roasted green tea taste was quite prominent in the creme brulee at Kintori Yakitori and it was also not too sweet either - love!"}
{"text":"Service is good like traditional authentic Japanese restaurants. That earn a star.  Yakitori is a bit disappointing because of the taste of most of them. I tried the eel, it tasted weird.  The chicken oyster was ok.  Chicken wings are by far the best, but you can do a outdoor picnic and grill as many as you like, it's good but it's normally good anyways. Chicken liver is ok, the 2 we ordered were different because one was overcooked the other was the opposite.  Pork belly was ok.  Lamb chop was not as good as grilling at home.  Overall the BBQ taste was not strong as expected.  When you order a lot then it adds up to be quite expensive.   Original pork ramen has so much fat in it, I'm not the only one who cannot stand the ramen.   The vibe is nice though. Having a sake or beer and ordering yaki whenever you like.  Good for eating and chatting with friends here."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to their soft opening today, and we were definitely looking forward to it.  We ordered their: Tokyo Scallion (salt) - quite good okra (salt) - it was ok, but might be better with \"tare\" instead chicken tail (tare) - very good and nicely charred chicken skin (salt) - it was ok, wish it was charred more, so crispier and less chewy chicken thigh with scallion (salt) - juicy thigh and sweet scallions chicken wing (salt) - crspy exterior and juicy interior (wished it came with 2 wings) jalapeño tsukune (salt) - juicy but bland :( cheese tsukune (tare) - juicy and much tastier compare to jalapeño tsukune wagyu beef (salt and wasabi) - juicy and nicely charred but lacking beef taste yakionigiri (konbu kelp) - the best of the night, the exterior is nicely charred like the ones you get from clay pot rice, while the interior was still pillowy soft and tasty  We ended our night with their green tea creme brûlée which was quite good and refreshing. Overall, the service was really good and attentive and hopefully they'll improve on their flavours and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp allows half stars as this joint deserves a little more than 3. I'd give it 3.5 stars. Been here twice specifically for Yakitori, which is located on the second floor of Kinton. I'll average my reviews based on the two visits. I do have to say if go on a Friday night, quality of service might be impacted since they tend to be understaffed. Once we were able to get someone's attention, the food didn't take long to arrive.   Their menu isn't as extensive, but will still have the yakitori staples such as chicken balls, gizzard, wings, beef tongues, etc. I find their seasonings, albeit flavourful, to be too salty for my liking. My personal favourites are the chicken skin, chicken heart, chicken wings, premium beef tongue, and takoyaki.   I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's perfect on days where I feel peckish and want some variety. And, I would say Yakitori Kintori is an accurate description of an Izakaya where the food comes second, only as accompaniment to drinks."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  $5 for a Stein of Sapporo Draft beer?! This might be the best deal in town if you are into Sapporo beer.   Here at Kintori Yakitori, not only you get the beer special but you can drink and eat some delicious skewers.  Sitting right at the open kitchen area and watching how the kitchen prepares the food is kind of fun. Here might not be the real Izakaya experience (quiet and zen) but it is great just to catch up with your friends.  Sake Sample ($14) is decent with good pour and of course I really enjoyed my Sapporo  In general: I found most of the \"meat\" skewer lack flavour but the braising sauce match much better with their seafood and vegetables  Momo (Chicken Thigh) Shimofiri Gyu-Tongue Kushi Kawa (Chicken Skin) Hizanankotsu (Knee Cartilage) Ton Toro (Pork Cheek) Ebi (Shrimp) Shlirake (mushroom) Eringi (mushroom)  Houji Cha Creme Brulee (Roasted Green Tea) Yuzu Sorbet   Service is polite and since it was not busy there on a Sunday evening, we can really take our time and placed order slowly.  Will I be back to have some more beers?! For sure! And of course some more of those little sticks of happiness!"}
{"text":"The Kinka Family has added another successful restaurant to their food empire earlier this March. Yakitori Kintori opened a little more than a month ago, and specializes in yakitori (grilled skewered chicken). The restaurant is housed on the second floor of Kinton Ramen 2 on Bloor in Koreatown. Additionally, the space is small so reservations are highly recommended if you're planning on heading there on the weekends.   We were seated at our reserved table (reserved card on top), and were each given the menu to peruse. The menu was a stand-alone, and printed on both sides with items such as skewers, vegetables, beef, pork, desserts, and drinks. I liked that the menu clearly illustrates the many parts of a chicken that customers can order to consume.    We started the night off with the tofu & kaisou salad ($7) [tofu & seaweed with ponzu jelly]. The portion was more than enough for the two of us to share. The salad was refreshing, and I really enjoyed the chewy seaweed in it. However, I am not a fan of tofu so naturally, I didn't eat any of it. In addition to their regular menu, they also have daily specials printed on a white piece of paper. On that Saturday, the daily specials consisted of 7 tapas dishes, and 7 yakitori dishes. We decided to go for the blowtorched salmon belly sashimi ($7.50), just to try it out. The sashimi arrived on a bed of white onion, and topped off with a slice of lemon.     If you're not too sure of what to order, it's best to go for the chef's selection. There were two choices, but we opted for the Chef's Selection 7 pieces ($14.80). This selection came with the following skewers; momo, sunagimo, sasami with mentai-mayo, tsukune, eringi, negi shio gyu, and ton toro. Apparently for the chicken, you have a choice between either tare sauce or salt on your skewers. However, our waitress didn't ask us for our preference, which was okay because we enjoyed the skewers that came out.   We also ordered the butabara [pork belly] ($2), negi shio gyu [beef with scallion sauce] ($3), and yakiniku gyu [beef with BBQ sauce] ($3). The negi shio gyu  was included in the Chef's Selection, but I liked it a lot that I re-ordered an additional skewer of it. Out of the three, my least favorite was the pork belly as it was fatty but wasn't as flavorful as I'd have liked.   Our last two orders of skewers before dessert was the mentai mayo tsukune [cheese meatball] ($2.30)  and enoki bacon [bacon with enoki mushroom] ($2.30).   The kitsune udon ($7) [deep fried tofu & udon noodle in dashi broth] was a creative dish, and arrived in a small bowl with three tofu-wrapped pockets. When you remove the sticks holding the tofu together; inside reveals the cooked udon. I absolutely loved the dashi broth as it was light, and perfect for after eating the skewers.  The night ended with Houji Cha creme brûlée [roasted green tea] ($5). It was a wonderful treat as the texture of the custard was creamy and explosive with the flavor of green tea.   The reservation indicated that if they're extremely busy, then you are allotted a 2 hour seating limit. I would say that is more than enough as we only took 1.5 hours. The washroom was clean, and they even provide mouthwash to rinse, and toothpicks.  Although the skewers are priced very well; it can really add up once you order the other items off the menu. Our bill for two came up to be around $77 (with tax and tip). Yakitori Kintori is a great addition to Koreatown, and I will definitely be back to try out the other items on the menu."}
