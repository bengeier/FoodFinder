{"text":"I've been looking forward to checking this place out since it opened. Finally made it down there and was not disappointed. The service was fantastic, the food was presented beautifully and delish. It was a real treat for a long time vegetarian/vegan like myself. Love to see restaurants supporting this lifestyle & dietary choice. It's a convenient location off of the freeway and the building it is in is pretty cool  to walk around and see the other artisans.   The only disappointment I have is that although they offer a wide variety of 'wheat free' (wf) food options, they are using oats & oat flour as the main binder for their recipes. I'm not opposed to the use of oats, but I was disappointed to find out that they do not use gluten free (GF) oats in their recipes. That would have made this place a 5 star review for me. I'll still visit and support, but it just limited my options dramatically."}
{"text":"Tasty food at this small eatery we found via Yelp.  The Quinoa breakfast bowl was quite delicious and a nice combination of flavors and textures.  Sweet, crunchy, salty, feuity and creamy with cinnamon undertone in a large bowl.   The Tempeh breakfast sandwich was a nice patty of tempeh and roasted veggies topped with avacado that gave it a savory, smoky quality.  Served on naan with smashed Yukon gold potatoes  (ummmm!) on the side and a small side salad.   Chad, who owns this with his wife, answered our questions about the journey from food truck to Agritopia and their vision for food and community. Ask him about the 11 concept words that are displayed above the counter.   For vegans, vegetarians, or someone looking for non-traditional fare, we would recommend giving Uprooted Kitchen a try."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! All plant based, vegan eatery here in Gilbert! Everything we tried was delicious. Ordered the sobe noodle salad with so many different yummy flavors, each bite was an explosion of pure yumminess ! Also tried the baked french toast and peanut butter cup....very tasty !!! Also had prickly pear kambucha, not house made but still very good ! Community style seating inside but they do have outside seating as well ! Met the owner, very nice man who came out to see how everyone liked the food too. I only wish they were open longer, say for dinner...even a couple of nights a week ! Cant wait to go back !!!"}
{"text":"The Uprooted Kitchen has it all! It's a must go to if in Gilbert! They have delicious food and personable owners. I love the soup and all the fresh ingredients. Life is better when you have The Uprooted Kitchen in it!"}
{"text":"I am delighted to write this review and equally delighted to have stumbled upon this hidden gem! I actually live about thirty minutes from Gilbert in Scottsdale and was lucky enough to have found this place!   First off, if you haven't been to this area of the Valley, I urged you to come! There is a beautiful community garden across the street and literally uproots you from the mundane suburbia into a rich fertile oasis of organic living! The actual restaurant itself is in a refurbished barn! It's super modern and very comfortable and inviting! Lots of young people and families around uniting and working! So cool!!  I ordered the tempe burger with a homemade potatoe bun and side salad. Wow, the dressing on the salad was soooo yummy! The entire meal was so fresh and enticing! The food was super easy to digest and I left feeling satiated within my cells!  Both the owners were working with their family and were extremely personable and friendly, they genuinely cared about my dining experience and were nice enough to tell me about the area!   Come to Gilbert and In-joy for yourself!:) it's totally worth the hike!:)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at their food truck several times in the Gilbert Farmers Market. So glad to see them as part of the new Barnone project.  Great food. Lots of locally sourced and organic ingredients. Kale power!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Had their food three years ago at the food truck and now it's even better at the restaurant! Had the Tempeh breakfast sandwich and the Soba noodles salad. Both delicious and presented very beautifully. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. Great service and delicious healthy food full of flavor! I like that they use minimal oil for cooking. I'm going to be a regular there!"}
{"text":"Great vegan desserts...many are wheat free. Excellent, friendly service by the male owner. Variety of main entrees and will customize as needed. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Still amazing - I leave here happy and satisfied every time! Best plant based option in all the Southwest"}
{"text":"You're probably sensing a theme in my posts--that is, where can I eat locally and healthfully but also conveniently on the go? I'm finding some surprising options, including a new food truck, The Uprooted Kitchen, which can be found at Food Truck Fridays in Phoenix, among other locations in metro Phoenix throughout the week.  While the truck is advertised as merely vegetarian, I was happily surprised to find that all options were, or could be made, vegan.  Choosing between two tempting salads, a cheesy wrap and the veg burger was quite difficult, but in the end, I gave in to my craving for something crisp and went with the cheesy wrap, made with tapioca-based daiya cheese substitute. (Mozzarella was also an option.)  The \"cheesy\" wrap was a guilt-free comfort food. While it felt filling and indulgent, the crisp wrap was stuffed with a wholesome medley of black beans, cauliflower, pureed butternut squash, corn, tomatoes and just a sprinkle of daiya. The decadent but light concoction was sided with a spicy but not heavy salsa plus greens and parslane.  I will definitely be back to sample the other options on this menu."}
{"text":"Had a short experience here but loved it! The atmosphere is welcoming both in the patio seating and the people who work here. Reminded me much of quaint shops you'd find walking through San Francisco.  I ordered the French Toast, I double checked with the gentle man taking my order that it would be vegan. He told me everything at Uprooted Kitchen is free of meat and dairy products but their menu says they have vegetarian options so just keep that in mind when ordering.  Wish they had more options available I'd be here everyday!  Dogs welcomed, outside patio, vegan."}
{"text":"This place is a vegetarians dream food truck. I ordered the cheese crisp and it's an all vegan option unless you choose the natural mozzarella. This food truck is at Agritopia on Wednesday after 4pm and on Saturday at old town gilbert.   Not much selection, but no complaints, it's a food truck, I don't expect a menu the size of Cheesecake Factory. Nevertheless, this place is definitely a try and I've recommended this to all my friends."}
{"text":"Amazing people cooking up some of the best plant based food!  Thankful to have this place close to home!"}
{"text":"Red lentil curry collard wrap was on point today. Packed with flavors and the lemon vinaigrette is to die for. As far as the portion goes, it was huge! Definitely filling only eating half of it. The uprooted kitchen sets the standard on delicious plant based lunch. This is a beautiful spot with a nice outdoor seating area. I had to buy not one, but 3 of the sun butter chocolate chip cookies. They were absolutely delicious I had to buy them all and save them for later!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS FOOD TRUCK (TRAILER), or Mabel!  Everything they serve is fantastic.  The pesto quesadilla is mine and my kids favorite.  Everyone I have brought to the truck (vegetarian or not) loves the food.  They have really added a unique element to GFM."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The food is delicious and the baked goods are decadant. There is a lack of tables and the price can be a little high."}
{"text":"I live in Surprise and we've driven out to Gilbert for them so many times. They are amazing and I can't explain how much joy we get from coming here. All the recipes are amazing !"}
{"text":"Started coming here because they have vegan pop tarts and now I'm hooked on their sweets. Their flavor changes depending what's on season but so far I've had a couple different types of berry pop tarts and apple pop tarts. I tried their hummus plate, french toast, and chocolate walnut banana bread. Everything tastes amazing and satisfying. A lot of seeds and nutty ingredients. I love that their recipes cater to tasting great and being really good for you. You order at the counter and you can sit inside the marketplace area or there is outdoor patio seating. The whole area is really beautiful. The restaurant is in the Barnone marketplace so beautiful space and surrounded by cool little shops and restaurants. The couple that owns the restaurant and make all the food is so sweet. They started out as a food truck and now they have their beautiful storefront. I'm not the only regular in the area, a lot of people are repeat customers because this place is so good!"}
{"text":"Yet another \"healthy\" place my wife has dragged me to against my will. Well, I liked it a lot and she LOVED it, so I guess we'll be visiting, again. Good stuff and it leaves you guilt free to enjoy the bad stuff (steak and beer) later. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here.  I got a salad and everything tasted fresh and yummy.  Didnt  even need the dressing even though it by-itself was so light and fresh,too.  We got the chocholate chip (version) of a cookie.  I didn't care for it....too many textures but my sister and daughter grave them like nothing else.    Its a little hard to find.  It's in Farmotopia or Agratopia...forget the name of the farm,lol.  It's in the same building as The Bar is in- at the end of the building-kind of hidden away.  We couldn't find it at first.  If you leave by the back road by the diner, you will see it on the left.  It will be a stable since I have 2 Vegan relatives.  Awesome new find.  Will go again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now and the food has been amazing both times. The owner and staff are super friendly and create a warm, welcoming vibe too.   This is my new go to spot for super healthy and delicious vegan food."}
{"text":"No creative juices today, but absolutely mandatory 5 star review.  Had a cauliflower scramble which was fine, but had a pea soup that was absolutely extraordinary, single best bowl of pea soup I've ever had.  I'd always presumed a pea soup had to be loaded with porky goodness to be supreme but I was astonished and delighted to be corrected."}
{"text":"Really delicious, can't wait to return. I had the cauliflower salad, and my mom had the french toast. Beautiful presentation and perfect execution of flavors."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you are in the area it is a MUST. The food is amazing, for vegans and non-vegans alike! They have seriously perfected both imitation meals (such as their amazing caesar salad) and their own specialties, like the fabulous tempeh breakfast sandwich! The staff is so great and welcoming as well! Not to mention the very cool Barnone atmosphere. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"I've been a vegetarian for eight years so a vegan restaurant within short walking distance to my house would be my dream come true, right? Not so much. I still have tastebuds, and the Uprooted Kitchen fails to excite them.  I have given the food truck now restaurant three tries so I think I can give it a fair assessment. The descriptions sound tasty, but the food is all pretty bland. The best thing I've had is their \"cheese\" crisp which is essentially a quesadilla made with hummus and sauteed veggies. It's very similar to what I make at home but with a $10 price tag.   I really wish I could give this place a glowing review because the service is very friendly, and I want to support my neighborhood dining options. However, I can't recommend the food to anyone, and that's the whole point of dining out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Family owned locally sourced makes it a great place for those who care about what they are feeding themselves and how it impacts the environment."}
{"text":"The owner was helpful and friendly. But as far as the food, my black bean burger was extremely dull and lacking flavor. I had to drown it in BBQ sauce just to get it down. Unfortunately I won't be back."}
{"text":"The chickpea scramble made my breakfast dreams come true! My husband had the Tempeh breakfast sandwich. I would highly recommend that choice too.   We often get questioned from our meat loving friends how \"we do it\"...not eating meat.... well this place is exactly how we do it! The food was so good, so tasty, and well presented.   The gentleman (I believe the owner) was super friendly and checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our food. We were greeted with smiles and friendly faces. Our meals came promptly."}
{"text":"WOW! The food is sooooo good! Never knew a black bean burger could taste like a home cooked meal! My food came out perfectly and was perfect temperature. Everything was made from whole food ingredients. Imagine that.   I will be back to eat again and I will be bringing my girlfriend!   Thanks for the excellent service and food!"}
{"text":"Simply the best plant based vegan eatery. You always walk away filling fill but not disgusting afterwards. They do weekly specials so some of the menu is always changing which is fun. The owners Chad takes your order and Erin the chef are always there and such a pleasure. I love that we can support a family run business locally. We are there once a week if not more. Love it!"}
{"text":"Killer plant based menu. Wife and I have been here a handful of times, tried several menu items, have never been disappointed. Owners are awesome, very personable and very hands on. We look forward to each visit with anticipation. If you are vegan/vegetarian or just want to treat your taste buds to some quality nutrition and bold flavors get your butt down here. We will continue to patronize this wonderful establishment time and time again!!!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian/vegan food. The employees are very nice. The restaurant is very clean and they have an outdoor seating area. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Loved! Especially since I had the pleasure of attending one of their classes and seeing exactly how the vegi sushi rolls, rice paper rolls and scallion pancakes were prepared. Bonus is their ingredients come straight from the farm across the street as soon as they are harvested. All certified organic crops. Healthy, delicious and couldn't be more fresh! The barnonaz building, area and vibe is something I wish we had more of around the valley."}
{"text":"Delicious and very friendly staff. Hummus salad is amazing. Not a big veggie fan but this doesn't even feel like I'm eating vegetables. So much flackr"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times & the quinoa cereal bowl is my favorite. It's a vegan menu with daily specials.  This place is located inside the barnone bulding in Agritopia. It has kind of a hippy vibe but what did I expect from a vegan place?   The food is great but it's a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"The cheese crisp is simply awesome! This truck is a must try in Phoenix metro whether you eat vegetarian or just like good food."}
{"text":"Very good food! I'm. It a vegan but I love eating here the food is delicious and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a new vegan restaurant in Gilbert! The food was amazing and even better it's a BYOB! Fair priced considering most vegan food is expensive. Took a friend for mimosas and breakfast. Had the French toast and the scramble. It was great! Only issue I had was they didn't have champagne glasses but cups did the trick!"}
{"text":"High quality vegan restaurant in Gilbert! The taste and the presentation of the food are unbeatable! The owner is always there to greet and talk to customers. I tried their cold brewed coffee which is good also. I wish they open longer hours!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this plant based eatery. Super friendly staff that kindly explained the ingredients in their food. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing people! I wish more people would discover this hidden gem! ~Aimee Takaha"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing! The staff was friendly, the food out of this world and the atmosphere was super!  There are not too many Vegan Restaurants out there that truly know how to make plant based meals taste so great. The cookies were to good to describe! I will most definitely be back when visiting AZ."}
{"text":"When I buy from a truck I assume it should be a good value as their overhead is low with out a building etc. However I think I am paying more because the are only open a few hours a day and need to be sustained on those limited hours.   This hold true with uprooted, I paid $8 for a spinach, and tempeh bowl, it had some walnuts and blue cheese. At a normal casual counter style place for this size it would be $4.50 for this salad.   Value aside the food was good, and healthy as I was hungry about 12 minutes later.  My cynicism is really directed at the food truck craze and not this trailer as they are on part with the lack of value"}
{"text":"So let me start off with I don't lead a vegan or vegetarian diet. But my daughter and her family do and we tried this place for a Sunday morning breakfast.  Everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered, I got the sour dough french toast. And it was really good, plus a snicker doodle cookie, it was the best. I little on the dry side, but the flavor was great.  All in all I would recommend this place to anyone that is vegan or vegetarian."}
{"text":"This place just wasnt very good.. The scramble was a big serving but just not tasty. Also this place is very expensive. 17$ for an ice tea and the scramble. Would not recommend sadly."}
{"text":"I love going to The Uprooted Kitchen! I'm lucky enough to live close by. Service is fantastic and he good is always amazing! When the weather is cooler I love sitting on the patio that overlooks the community garden."}
{"text":"Amazing place. We drive here all the way from southwest Chandler. Please go and enjoy the cleanest food I've ever eaten - it will not disappoint! Plus I love the location and surroundings of the place. Super unique!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. My wife loved the burger and my cauliflower scramble was awesome! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love to eat healthy but when I am out and about it is very difficult to stick to a vegan/ wheat free diet and that's why I LOVE Uprooted Kitchen! I go as often as possible to the Gilbert Farmers Market  for many reasons, but I always save time for breakfast  I have had some delicious food there and some that they are working on perfecting.  They have a creative menu and I can only see them getting better as time go on.  This is REAL food made with LOVE, and it's obvious to see and taste."}
{"text":"My best friend discovered this gem of a restaurant today.  I am a vegan from California and my friend was looking for a restaurant that offered a vegan menu in her area.   We choose the veggie burger on the menu and throughly enjoyed the burger.  The owners are very personable and the atmosphere was quit enjoyable.  If you are in the area, do not miss out on this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been a fan and a customer of theirs since the Gilbert Farmer's market days.  My go-to was always the quinoa breakfast bowl... so good, so filling, so healthy!  I was super excited to see them open in Barnone near Agritopia!  I've tried their \"cheese crisp\" and peanut butter cup, both were super tasty.  I love that they take such pride in the ingredients, the unique menu items, and their customers.  If you like healthy and tasty vegetarian food, definitely give them a try! :)"}
{"text":"We've been eating at TUK since the early days of their food truck. The new spot at Barnone is just perfect and the food as usual does not disappoint! My favorite is the cheese crisp which is different every week but always delicious. Do not be afraid of the vegetarian/vegan menu, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Very cute area! Everything there is very quaint and has a great atmosphere! Uprooted Kitchen is an awesome place for people who love healthy, local, fresh food! All vegan and a ton of gluten free options too! My mom who isn't gluten free or vegan loved it as well!"}
{"text":"First off, long before I went to Agritopia Farm's Gilbert Market, I was following Uprooted Kitchen on Instagram, desperately hoping for an opportunity to try it out. It was everything I hoped it would be! I am vegetarian, though I eat very little dairy, so this place is perfect for me. I got the Un-Bun Veggie Burger and it was delicious. All of the ingredients were fresh. It is nice being able to go out and get a meal you feel is actually healthy!  I was sad that the peanut butter cups were sold out, they look amazing. I have to go back and try their breakfast because that sounds awesome as well."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Great to hear their story and to support a local business. The food is great and healthy. Ask questions to best know what suits your tastes"}
{"text":"Perfect. A place that not only gets great food, but great service! The proprietors are awesome. They took time to go over every detail of their dishes. Their food is unique and healthy. And BOOM it tastes fantastic! A must try even if your aren't a 'plant based person'. One of my new favorites in the Phoenix food scene!"}
{"text":"I have been dining at Uprooted Kitchen ever since they have been a food truck. When they stopped food truck operations in preparation for the opening for their current location, I was sad but extremely excited by a storefront and increase in regular business hours where I could come and go as I pleased. Flash forward, they opened inside Barnone in 2016. It's located on the north end the silver, metal barn in Agritopia. Their counterfront design is very simple and mostly metal, carrying on the theme of Mable, their beloved food truck. It also matches the barn pretty well and fits right in with the Barnone vibe. They do offer both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor seating is a single, long, family-style table, with separate chairs, and rests in a large hall area that can be converted to an event space. Outdoor seating  consists of smaller picnic tables. I'm not entirely sure there's enough shade for a hot day, but for a spring day, it's perfect.   Chad and Erin are the people behind the operation. They've done such a great job at building up their business, from the food to their employees. They are the kind and accommodating. They have a can-do attitude that I appreciate especially on days when I'm running behind, and they'll still allow me to pick up my food even after they've closed. Their employees also share this type of attitude and appear to always work hard. They do a great job at keeping their space clean and fully stocked on items at all times.  One would order his or her food at the counter. If dining in, they will bring the you. They have items you can order from a menu, and there is also a cold case full of their pastries/food displays, beverages. They serve plant-based/vegan food. This is the BEST vegan food I have ever eaten. They do a very good job combining diverse ingredients and spices to create flavorful dishes and food pieces. They have dishes high in protein without use of vegan meat. I'm not sure how they make certain dishes but overall, they seem to use minimal oil when cooking. All the food is very healthy and clean. The food presentation is simple and appropriate. I could go on and on for days about how good and healthy the food is."}
{"text":"Awesome! I had previously bookmarked this place when I saw it on the Yelp weekly list for vegan and vegetarian restaurants. I didn't realize it was in Barnone. We actually went to eat at Joe's Farm Grill but the lunch rush line made it undesirable.  We wandered in and decided to check it out. Mmmmm, curry! They happened to have curry paper wraps as a part of the cold case items. I went vack and forth between this and the veggie burger. Obviously, I decided my love for curry was most important and a cold ginger brew. The Beau got the Cobb salad and a cold brew coffee.   Family style seating sort of weirds me out. With that said, we sat across from a lady working on her laptop and she didn't seem to mind. Mind you, the Beau and I are sitting there discussing choice cuts of beef at a plant based dining restaurant... hopefully we didn't effect the review for others (Ha!)  My dish came with what appeared to be horseradish but instead was some type of amazing coconut deliciousness to add to my stellar wrap. The portion initially appeared small but it actually hit the spot, which is a wonderful thing about plant based food... it's usually nutrient dense and quite filling. I believe it had curried cauliflower and was not an overwhelming curry flavor (although I like it that way), I believe it had mushroom, sweet potato, pickled red onion and an herbed quinoa. I could totally be wrong but it was good, so it doesn't really matter. My ginger brew was fabulous on my tummy.   The cobb salad was far from what the Beau was expecting and that is not to say he didn't enjoy it more than he thought he would, it just means he was likely expecting eggs and cild cuts. Packed full of seeds and nuts and beans and avocado and olives and beets, with a ranch style dressing. He was not disappointed and I heard him say more than once it was a very good salad.  Thank you Uprooted kitchen for allowing my guy to enjoy plant based food... maybe there is a chance of turning the whole family off of meat."}
{"text":"I am vegan and this is my favorite local vegan restaurant!!! Such a clean, and warm atmosphere. All the staff are sweet. I love that Chad always takes his time to get to know the customers and asks how their food is several times throughout eating. I've gotten the tempeh breakfast sandwich, the veggie burger, french toast, peanut butter cup, banana chcolate chip bread, and zucchini chocolate chip bread. All of it was fantastic. My favorite is the tempeh breakfast sandwich! It's bursting with flavor! You already know this is my go-to place for some great, all-natural food!"}
{"text":"The Uprooted Kitchen is now a restaurant at the Barnone project in Agritopia, near The Coffee Shop and Joe's Farm Grill. Formerly, it was a food truck at the same site.  With the new permanent kitchen, the Romanoff family has expanded their menu and their hours. This is great because their food is amazing.  What I like is that everything is bursting with flavor and variety and is always plated in the most beautiful way. It is all plant based and, even though I'm an omnivore, I've never had anything that wasn't outstanding. At breakfast, we've had their french toast, granola, scrambles, etc., but my favorite is the breakfast sandwich, which also includes a fresh salad. Lunch offerings include full cooked meals, but also grab n' go. The rice paper rolls with quinoa and vegetables (plus ginger almond sauce) are a must try.  The space is very inviting and they also have a patio. The restaurant is BYOB, so you can bring down wine from local winery Garage East or beer from 12 West. They also have kombucha, tea, coffee, kefir and other drinks.  Everyone is gracious and enthused about their work. They buy only great ingredients, often from local farmers, bakers and other makers.  We try to eat here at least once or twice a week!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite foodie trucks.  I am probably at this truck once a week at the Gilbert Farmer's Market.  The husband and wife owners are super sweet.  They also serve lunch at Food Truck Fridays but I haven't had a chance to get out there yet.    The portions are huge and I always have leftovers of my favorite dish.  It is the chilled butternut oats and it comes organic fruit and scone of the day (topped with coconut or almond milk).  It is almost like a baked oatmeal and it is so good.   The scone is always leftovers for me.  If I start my Saturday morning here, I always make better choices for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"I love uprooted! Everything that I have tried has been delicious and they always have new dishes. The service is wonderful, even when they are busy. I am also gluten free and they are very good at clearly marking things. I always feel great after eating here!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! Tried the breakfast sandwich with potatoes and it was delicious. The coffee was excellent as was the banana chocolate chip bread. Great little place with wonderful vegan food."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since they were a food truck! One of the best plant-based restaurants in the valley! They use fresh and local ingredients and ALL of their pastries are made fresh daily! Their food is clean-eating at it's best and it is always packed with so much flavor and love!"}
{"text":"Go eat here. It will change your diet and your life for the better! The ginger brew is AMAZING! Highly suggest the buckwheat crepe special as well if it is still available."}
{"text":"Looked up vegan restaurants while in the neighborhood  on yelp and found this gem of a place but It's more than just a vegan restaurant. It's located in a cool industrial metal barn with neighboring small pop up shops and boutiques and right across from a community farm.  The food was incredible ( we ordered 3 dishes and split them- crepe, tempeh sandwich and  burrito on their brunch menu). The owners are a husband wife duo, the wife is the chef. I promise you won't be disappointed. Worth the drive from Scottsdale   Also in the barn there's a winery and brewery!"}
{"text":"Holy no-cow wow! This vegan restaurant may well be the best in Phoenix. The menu is limited, and changes weekly, but the quality and taste are exceptional! We got a small bowl of white bean soup, a crepe and a salad bowl. It was way more than we could eat in one sitting. All the veggies were fresh and well prepared and the dressings were very flavorful. The pesto on the bean soup was especially great. The homemade crackers with the bowl and naan with the soup are not to be overlooked as well. The treats are not to be missed as well. We got a delicious coconut macaroon.   I also love the location. With its evolution from an airstream food truck to a quonset hut - Uprooted has solid style. Places like this are great for anyone looking for a healthy and tasty meal - not just vegans. It reminded me of our favorite vegan place in Austin - Casa de Luz - but without feeling like you were in a commune. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent, clean and healthy! This place is amazing! A new favorite for my boyfriend and I."}
{"text":"I'm so excited to finally have some time to visit uprooted! First time here and it was as good as I hoped.  Chad helped us out and was entirely friendly and welcoming. I know I have an awesome real food, healthy food, made with love food option not too far from home now. Thanks Uprooted for you passion and dedication to your craft - all the way from family owned and operated to reducing waste and supporting other local businesses.  You guys rock!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic spot for plant based food lovers! Erin and Chad Romanoff are the masterminds behind this delicious kitchen, and it is a gift from them that they have shared their recipes with us! Check them out! You won't be disappointed. This place is delicious. It feels good to support a local, family run business while eating clean, whole cruelty-free food. We will be frequenting this gem!"}
{"text":"Best, cleanest, friendliest food truck ever! Smart people giving others the gift of clean delicious eating. I love your desserts, and the vega cheese crips are always devine. Thank you for sharing your talents with the rest of the world! The @Gilbert Farmers Market is so lucky to have this food truck!!!"}
{"text":"We found the Uprooted Kitchen here on Yelp while looking for a lunch spot that my vegetarian son could take me to. The reviews were great so we made the drive from Mesa. I was pretty excited when we drove up and turned in to Agritopia. I had no idea this place existed although I've lived in the valley my whole life. :P    My son and I both ordered the tempeh breakfast sandwich and a cold brew coffee. The food came out pretty quickly and the breakfast sandwich was great!  On our way out, we purchased desserts! I recommend the snickerdoodle or the chocolate mint cookie thing. :)   The building, was a treat to walk through and if the weather wasn't so hellish, we would have taken a stroll through the garden as well.   All in all, it was a great lunch experience!"}
{"text":"I come here probably once a week because it's so bomb. They have different weekly specials and I'm just waiting until they have veggie sushi back on that list! I like the tempeh breakfast sandwich, the rice rolls, and any of the pastries but especially the chocolate peanut butter cup omg. I love seeing Chad at the front he's always so friendly to me and makes me feel welcome. I wish they were open for longer hours! I'd love to be there dinner time. It's one of my fav places to go"}
{"text":"We got the Buckwheat Crepe and the Veggie burger. Both were really tasty and filling. The Sweet Potato Blondie was AMAZING! As was their version of the chocolate cookie. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been exploring plant based food options lately,  to broaden my dining horizon.... and I stumbled upon this neat restaurant. I believe they once had a food truck, but now have this spot within Agritopia' s grounds. Everyone working was friendly and knowledgeable on the menu and food choices. I had a vegan burger, with a side salad, and a ginger brew to drink. I was pleasantly surprised. Growing up a carnivore, I was never into faux  burgers, but boy did I enjoy this one! I'll be back the next time I'm craving a healthy, plant based meal!"}
{"text":"This place is cute and clean and the staff is very very nice. BUT the food is the stereotypical health nut stuff. It's not just vegan (trust me, I'm vegan) it's ALSO undercooked and under-seasoned. EXAMPLE: dessert sweetened with dates instead of sugar. And it's just weird. \"French toast\" looks and tastes more like bread pudding, tempeh sandwich looks and tastes like a bean burger. I think people who aren't vegan eat here and mistake the guilt-free feeling of finally eating something cruelty-free for the feeling of eating something that tastes good. Skip this place and just go to Green instead. Edit to add: they guilt trip people into removing negative reviews."}
{"text":"Sunflower Chocolate chip cookie was about 2 inches thick and was loaded with yummy goodness. Enjoyed the cookie with a large mug of coffee(free refills).   I'll definitely be back for more.  Owner, Chad is very sweet and accommodating."}
{"text":"This cute little spot is always better than expected. This is a good place when you want a healthy option. To be honest, most of the time I read the menu and nothing really sounds good. I usually just pick something random and then when I eat it, I am pleasantly surprised. I have not been disappointed yet. It is more on the expensive side but you get good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fresh, healthy plant-based place this place is so worth!   First off, it's in Agritopia which is just an absolutely perfect location for this place considering how cute and intimate it is.  I ordered the Quinoa Breakfast Bowl with coconut milk (freshly made in the kitchen!). When I first walked in, I was greeted and immediately helped by one of the owners, Chad. He was incredibly kind and helpful and we chatted the entire duration of my wait for the food! I don't eat only plant-based foods, but I am a huge foodie and love to try new places. It's always a plus when owners make it a point to meet and greet new customers.   I am also extremely allergic to nuts so sometimes am wary of plant-based/vegan restaurants, but Chad was very confident when telling me the ingredients and did not forget any ingredient (yes, unfortunately this tends to happen at some places.. -.- Thank god because the house made bark is so yummy!! Perfect crunch and added sweetness to the quinoa bowl.   This place has healthy plant-based food and not just soy substitutes. The food is delicious (atleast the quinoa bowl was ;) ), the prices are not bad, and the customer service is excellent. I hope it becomes more popular because small business owners usually have the best food! I already suggested this place to my plant-based friends!  Plus!!! They host yoga sessions there too"}
{"text":"Wonderful little Vegan spot in Agritopia! The staff here is extra friendly and the food is extra delicious. The black bean burger is amazing one of the best I've ever tried. My mom and I also purchased a selection of pastries to take home (peanut butter cup, tiramisu, cake) all were delicious!"}
{"text":"The Uprooted Kitchen food truck parked at the Gilbert Farmers Market today. I hope they come back every week.   Unlike the several other food trucks that have visited and quickly given up at the farmers market, Uprooted Kitchen seems to understand two important points: 1) people want to eat breakfast (not dinner) at 8am, and 2) farmers markets are visited by people who like to eat plant-based food and not only meat-focused dishes.  The truck offers a vegetarian and vegan menu that would appeal to eaters of all types. The had oatmeal, granola, and quinoa bowls with fruit, a tofu scramble, and a variety of breakfast and dessert baked goods.   I tried the quinoa, which was warmed and served with cinnamon and fruit (kiwi, plums, berries). I loved it. It had a bit of coconut milk added but almond milk was also available.   On the side was a blueberry scone. At first I was a little put off because it was cold and not dry like the scones I've had elsewhere, but one bite reversed my impression. It was delicious.  I'd probably never track down a food truck, but if I see them again, I'll stop for a meal. And if we're really lucky, they'll get the Bergies coffee stand to set up next to them at future markets."}
{"text":"Great plant-based restaurant and kind service. I love their morning breads and breakfast items. Can't wait to try lunch. Definitely worth trying, vegetarian or not"}
{"text":"Tempeh breakfast sandwich was so good!  Great flavor combo. Terrific portion. Definitely will be my new favorite go to.!"}
{"text":"Our first time and we will definitely be back!  Super fresh ingredients, cozy atmosphere, and excellent service!  I had the tempeh breakfast sandwich and it was so good and very filling!!  My daughter had the baked French toast and it was amazing!!!  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We drove pretty far out of the way to make sure to stop here on our drive from Prescott to Tucson, and we were not disappointed! This restaurant is in a complex of other restaurants, stores, and businesses and they are all so beautiful. The space is gorgeous, the staff was super friendly and they all obviously loved what they were cooking up at The Uprooted Kitchen. My husband had the daily special which was curried cauliflower tacos. I ordered the black bean burger with just a side salad (although those sweet potato fries looked and smelled soooo good). My husbands curried cauliflower tacos were simply to die for good. They were just the right amount of spicy without being offensive to a sensitive palette and they were flavorful, warm, & filling. My black bean burger was a little dry. It had their house made BBQ sauce on it, which was really runny and mostly ran off the burger when it was served to me. I think a thicker sauce would have done a better job (mustard or mayo consistency), and I think the bun could be re-thought (very heavy and dry), but overall it was a great meal. OOH and to drink we had the ginger lemonade (I think that's what it was called, but if not it was very similar) and it was really good too. It tasted a lot like a lemon ginger kombucha, and was very refreshing and tangy. We also debated trying some of the desserts- they looked truly fantastic, but we were pretty stuffed after our meal. NEXT TIME we are coming for those desserts. I would highly recommend a stop at this place. It's worth going out of the way to get there. It's a great road trip stop, and it's pretty close to the Phoenix- Mesa Airport (AZA) for those who have some time to stop before their flights."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I am not vegan so this isn't my top option of food choices, but it was enjoyable.   We always love coming to Barnone and usually take a trip to the brewery and occasionally the pizza place here but have always been interested in trying The Uprooted Kitchen and, well today was that day.   At the end of Barnone you'll find Uprooted Kitchen with long community style seating as well as an outdoor patio. The staff was all friendly and there was a variety of vegan food options to choose from, most ranging around the $13 mark. The menu is split into three segments: Cereal, Sweet, and Savory.   We got the tempeh breakfast sandwich and veggie burger from the savory portion of the menu. We really enjoyed the tempeh breakfast sandwich and found there was plenty of flavor and it was easy to eat. It comes with a side salad, which the dressing was delicious and a smashed potato. The veggie burger was fine but it wasn't outrageously flavorful or bold it was a bit plain to be honest. It also came with the side salad and delicious dressing. We sampled the iced Chai Tea and loved it!   Overall, this place is unique and there are plenty of food options. I thought the prices were a bit high for what you get, but if you are vegan and this is what you have - it is probably pretty delicious and worthwhile. We'd come back here again in the future but it would not be our regular stop."}
{"text":"Very friendly environment from the various parishioner. The vibe is very trendy it's had a slight cafeteria feel to it as the space is shared with other retailers. I thought the menu was a bit limited, but fresh and innovative. I would go a bit heavier on the seasonings but overall a decent spot to stay green."}
{"text":"As I was out of the office traveling for work it was lunchtime. So, I took to Yelp and started looking to for the closest Vegan restaurant in the area, this is the first place that popped up. To my surprise, this place had 5 stars with 84 great reviews so you know I had to stop in for a bite.  I walked up to the register and was greeted by the 2 owners. They were very nice and I explained this was my first time here. He walked me through the menu and told me their story. As I looked the through the menu I decided to go with the black bean burger with potatoes. As I sat and waited for my food I watched other getting their food and I grew excited, it all looks so good. When my plate arrived I was eager to eat. The black bean burger was amazing and their potatoes were yummy. This is by far one of my new favorite vegan spots. The service was great and so was the food. I can't wait to stop in again when I'm in the area!   I just wish it was so far from downtown!"}
{"text":"This place is a vegetarian dream food truck. I already recommended it to all my friends not a lot of menu option but I'm not complaining, I'm not expecting a cheese factory size menu."}
{"text":"This thanksgiving cheese crisp was the best fall themed dinner EVER! U guys amaze me!"}
{"text":"Yummy vegan food! The tempeh burger and buckwheat crepe were delicioso! Save room for desert though, the chocolate mint date \"cookie\" is ooey-gooey-goodness. 6 stars, would go again anytime I'm in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Visited them at the Gilbert Farmers market Saturday. (What a great place with vegan/vegetarian things to buy!)  Had the Tempeh breakfast sandwich which was tasty and filling. (Would have liked a little bit more sauce and a whole tomato slice.)  Ya I am picky sometimes...  Loved the Un-Pop Tart!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of family owned business bringing character and something different to AZ. Chad was awesome sharing the history of the business. The location is awesome. The food is unique and tasty and of course super healthy. I am happy to see more healthy options for eating out!"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant may have converted me into a plant-based eater.  They've at least converted me to a regular customer when I'm in town.  (We're from Portland where there is a lot of great food.)  It is apparent how much, thought, effort and love is put into this food.  We ordered the buckwheat crepe dish, veggie burger, tempeh sandwich, french toast and a host of desserts.  (We were hungry and we wanted to try lots of stuff!).  Everything was super fresh and tasty and nuanced.  Apparently, they use veggies that are grown on property.  That's about as local as it gets.  Also, the facility (Barnone) is such a cool concept and well-executed.  You can get good craft beer in the same facility and bring it down to the Uprooted Kitchen.  (You can also watch a letterpress company do their thing and also watch various machinery being built; there is also a wood-fired pizza place.)  The owners were super helpful, kind and attentive.  I would recommend trying this place even if you are not a vegetarian, vegan or whatever.  Just great, healthy food that makes you feel good when you're done."}
{"text":"Always good. Lots of variety. Great service. I had been looing for the truck but found out tofay at the tour at Agritopia that it was on there property. So now I'm about to chow down. Make the trip. Its worth it."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Just had the Breakfast Tempeh Sandwich. First time having tempeh. Tasted amazing. Everything was fresh and very well made. First time here but will defiantly be back. Talked with the owners who were super nice and took the time to talk with me and encourage me with my new vegan diet. If you're looking for Vegan options in the Gilbert area this place is a cant miss! Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The southwest kale salad was awesome with the feta tofu, colorful vegetables, and seed crackers.  Everything was fresh and tasty, I highly recommend if your looking for great vegan/vegetarian food."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the people are some of the nicest folks I have ever met in my life.  For those who aren't vegetarian or vegan, the food may taste a little different, but as a former vegetarian I can't get over how amazing their menu is. Everything tastes so fresh, like it was dug up yesterday and served today. Their concept is so clever and their dishes certainly take a lot of creativity! Try the \"cheese\" crisp- you'll be amazed at how delicious vegan can be!"}
{"text":"The Uprooted Kitchen was so adorable, delicious and friendly! Everything they have is plant based! They are a small business inside BarnOne located next to Joes Farm Grill. My husband and I both had the Breakfast Scrambled Burrito. I didn't get a picture of it before we ate it but I snapped a picture of what the inside of the burrito looks like. Tip: the salsa/tomato sauce they put on the side to go with it made the taste pop!"}
{"text":"Recently a girlfriend and I ate lunch here on a Sunday afternoon, and we were nicely surprised, even though neither of us are full time vegans. We both try to eat healthy as much as possible. I had their walnut salad sandwich and it was very flavorful and filling, and the ice tea was amazing! We would definitely go back, and are planning to take friends here in a couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Wow!  I was not expecting delish vegan food from a food trailer!  OMG it was soooooo good!  I had the Vegan French Toast and the grains and fruit and everything tasted AWESOME and was all very hand made! I'm going to try to eat from this place as much as I can from now on!  If they had a restaurant nearby, I'd be there all the time!  There service was great!  They took credit which made it easier for us.  Even emailed me a receipt!  The prices are great for the quality of food as well!  I give it 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I had the breakfast sandwich with tempeh.  It was very good.  I especially enjoyed the BBQ sauce they provided on the side.  The sweet potatoes were also excellent.  It is on the expensive side, but I did feel like it was a good portion.  I think it said that it was spicy, but it was pretty mild to me.  Very good overall.  Excellent customer service.  I just need a raise to eat here on a regular basis.  :-)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The dish I got had such a great combination of flavors, everything was fresh and plant-based. Even something as simple as their potatoes were delicious. They've got a great bakery selection as well. The owners and staff were all super nice! Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Delicious beautiful food! I had the Squash Oat bowl at the Gilbert Farmer's Market. It was DEE-LISH.....  and very fresh tasting.    Just a warning....they use no sugar or much in the way of fats, so the food may come off as a bit bland for those not used to natural foods, but it is worth giving a try.  You will feel energized the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten at the food truck, not their new brick and mortar location, but it is amazing. I had the cheese crisp for breakfast and not only was it stuffed with so many yummy veggies, it was huge making it almost two meals. I can't wait to try their new spot."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat and I'm not even vegan or vegetarian. Their food is full of flavor and always made with high quality and a lot of local ingredients. Their baked goods are so tasty and again nutritious!! My favorites being the carrot bread, cashew snickerdoodle cookie, and sun butter trail mix cookie! The owners Erin and Chad and so friendly and I'm amazed that they remember so many customers names. I would eat here everyday of the week if I could. Thanks uprooted for providing Gilbert with delicious and healthy food!!"}
{"text":"I am so thrilled to have such a fantastic restaurant close by. Located in barnone, a place I had totally miss judged before entering, this restaurant is one of several small businesses operating inside. Their food was clean, fresh, with the Perfect Blend of flavors. All their dishes are beautifully presented as well. The Proprietors are the nicest couple. I wanted a meal that my body would feel good with, not just full. They delivered and I will become a regular."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan but I love this place! Clean comfortable environment. You can see your food being prepared. The employees are so nice and I always feel so relaxed every time I go to this restaurant. The food is so fresh and clean. The peanut butter cup is one of the best dessert I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I love this place and the owners. We have eaten here numerous times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and each time the food is delicious. It's also a feast for your eyes - you have to photograph it. Ingredients are fresh and the chef takes real pride in making the best use of those growing in nearby Agritopia. We also make regular use of weekly specials - we really love the sushi. If you are already plant based/ vegan you'll love it and if you're not you should give it a try. I have taken non vegans to eat there and they loved it too."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite food truck EVER!  Vegetarian, vegan, and lots of gluten free options.  All the produce is grown fresh and local.  Good for breakfast or lunch/dinner.  You really can't go wrong here.  Run by an amazing husband and wife team.  Everything they make is healthy, delicious, and filling!  For breakfast, try the quinoa breakfast bowl or chickpea frittata.  My husband loves the vegan French toast (and he's a rabid carnivore).  Their scones are to die for.  I've had several of the soups on their dinner menu and they are all great too.  My only complaint is that the Uprooted Kitchen isn't open every day...and I think they need to make a cookbook too!  ;)"}
{"text":"This place is very good! It was a little hard to find, but i was not disappointed! The person who took my order was very kind and all the food there is cooked to order and vegan, which i love. I had the breakfast quinoa bowl and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant. Wonderful customer service and amazing food!!! Everything was of the best quality. Even our kids and aunt who aren't Vegan loved the food. This restaurant was situated in a big building that housed other businesses such as a letter press shop, etc... the building sits on a farm like property with orange groves and lots of other eateries. The atmosphere is fresh and sociable.  You will not be disappointed with this plant based restaurant. It was such a treat! Next time in the area I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am not vegan or vegetarian, but do have a number of food allergies which worked well for this restaurant.  This was my first time to give it a try and was very happy with my food.  The owners are very friendly and helpful when making the food selections.  I love that they don't use much soy with their recipes.  I tried the special, which was the red lentil omelette with salad and sweet potato fries.  I loved this dish, it was excellent and I would definitely order it again.  I also tried the peach ice cream, which was very good.  I'm very excited to come back again and try some of their other options.  Definitely a keeper!"}
{"text":"Uprooted kitchen is near to my home and my work and it is such a blessing to have a healthy breakfast that is so creative nearby. I don't normally eat vegan and I also have an allergy to wheat and oats, yet I can still always find something that I can eat and is delicious. Chad, Erin and their boys (and the rest of the staff) are always helpful and happy to see you, keep up the good work!"}
