{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch before an appointment. Had a grilled tuna melt which was excellent. Loaded with a creamy tuna filling and tomatoes and cheddar cheese on multi grain bread. Had the flan and bread pudding cake. Moist and delicious. Great coffee too. Will happily go back when in the area."}
{"text":"I recently tried this place after wanting to for so long, and it was great! Their prices are typical for a cafe, and their products are absolutely delicious. I recently tried their smoothie and it was the best I've had in a long time! The service was also great, the woman who served me was a sweetheart! 
The place's atmosphere was awesome, the decorations are really cute. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to get a delicious Argentine empanada. The owner is from Mendoza, Argentina. (If that sounds familiar its because thats the spot where great wines are birthed).

They've been in Vaughan for 3 years and are located adjacent to the medical buildings.

Since they are a cafe they serve all kinda of specialty coffees, lattes and hot drinks.

They also make grilled sandwiches (panini).

I had two types of empanadas: the chicken and the beef. The chicken was full of flavour, served hot and filled with chicken mixed with onions and red peppers. 
The beef was typical: ground beef with traces of hard-boiled egg & onions. (Normally the beef empanadas give me a lot of heartburn- i still eat them cause they're so good- but I always pay for it later. Not this time. Very nice surprise)


 I added two dulce de leche ca√±os (pastry cannons filled with DDL) they were sitting out in the cold fridge and I bought them anyway because good dulce de leche is always a dark brown (not like the butterscotch/ caramel crap lol) and i could taste that they weren't fresh but they were still so good (imagine them fresh!!!) 

Over all really tasty food- i gave them 3 stars because they don't post the prices of their foods (i just ordered and never bothered to ask.) Four empanadas (smaller than jamaican beef patties) and two pastries came to $16!!!!!  

ALSO- they charge you if your order is under $5 and you're not paying cash (so sketchy when places do this) also it would be nice to see them advertise a little more: their location is hidden. 

Overall: decent place!"}
{"text":"I eat lunches here 4/7 days of the week ! Tastes like my mom made it. The staff is always friendly and the food is delicious !!!"}
{"text":"Full of delicious food and pastries. The breakfast sandwich is massive and will keep you full for hours. The empanadas are also worth a trip. It's more than you would pay for a crappy McDonald's breakfast but it's so worth it. 

The staff is friendly and accommodating. Lovely people and clean, friendly environment with plenty of seating."}
