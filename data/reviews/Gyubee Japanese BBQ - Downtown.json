{"text":"This is the new location the 1st location is in Markham, so decided to try this place out after seeing it from Blog TO if you do plan to go here either taxi or uber it as parking is pretty hard to find because it's right on Bloor st with limited parking spots available near by.

I called to try and make a reservation but they do not take reservations only walk ins, there was a long line up to the door we waited about 30-40 mins to get a table. The menu has a variety of meats from seafood: shrimp,squid,chicken,pork & beef they also have bibimbap.

Everything is ordered by pieces the pork & beef are sliced very thin which I didn't like.
We all liked the marinated Kalbi beef tasted really good & the peppered beef were thick strips & tasted good actually

Sides include lettuce,kimchi,mushrooms,cold noodles,bibimbap,brocolli,cold noodles there might have been more

Bibimbap was ok small portion rice with seaweed,sauce and a sunny side up egg 

For the meat options definitely order more if you have a big group because the size of the cuts won't fill you up unless you eat bibimbap with it

Dessert menu had only 2 items creme brûlée or melona bars ordered one of each, creme brûlée was good crunchy top shell and creamy & melona bar is only ONE per person

Everything came fast even though the restaurant was full.
Currently the beer size options aren't available on the menu so they only have Sapporo cans we ordered 2 mojitos lychee & the yuzu mojito which were really good

After eating here I can still see why other non AYCE Japanese bbq is still better because of the beef quality,portion size and freshness so in conclusion if you don't want to pay per order at other Jap bbq places this is the place to go with all you can eat & a la carte menu"}
{"text":"Good but Gyu Kaku is better. Not a huge selection of proteins here and the cuts can tend to be fatty. Vegetables don't come marinated. Not sure it's worth the $30 but it was okay."}
{"text":"The food was good. BUT there was a waiter who seems like want to flirt with one of my friend, he just walked around our table like all the time even just stood by and listening what we were talking. Asked us some very personal questions which was really annoying!!!! What makes us never want to go back again."}
{"text":"Pro: Excellent service, food comes quickly, amazing desserts, great variety
Con: meat a little too fatty

What a great location! Right outside of U of T campus, this restaurant choose the right place to open. All my friends have been raving about this place so I thought I would go and treat myself. We arrived at around 6pm on a Thursday night and had to wait for around 10 minutes. 

Service: I cannot describe in words how impressed I was with the service. The server we had was so attentive and came to take our order as soon as she saw us pick up the menu again. She answered all the questions we had about the items and even gave us recommendations. This is truly impressive for an ayce place.

Food: Portions are small so I would recommend getting one of each item for the first round and then order what you like for the second. The meat quality is very decent but it is a little too fatty for my liking. By the end, we felt very heavy from all the grease. The vegetables are very fresh and the inoki mushrooms were seasoned with garlic and butter which was a very nice touch.

I need a whole section dedicated to the creme brûlée and rice. Yes you read that right, the rice. Their rice was unbelievably good. I don't know how they cook it but wow it was delicious. Also the creme brûlée is absolutely amazing. It might not look like it but personally I could eat 6 of those. These two things are a must get! 

Overall, this is a wonderful restaurant that serves some of the best bbq in town. Do go visit when you have time but just know that your diet plans will go down the drain."}
{"text":"The location looked small but surprisingly was much more spacious than I thought. There is a back section after the kitchen that seats the bigger groups. This place takes cash and debit only. 

The portions were reasonable based on the number of orders you make for each item. The beef brisket, pork belly and kalbi definitely were my favourite. The chicken thigh and shrimp is good for the first round of ordering but you can do without it. I surprisingly enjoyed the cabbage salad which had a nice sesame dressing and the cold tofu (it was sweet and savoury). What caught me by surprised is the seasoning they have for you to dip with the sweet soy sauce. It had a smokey curry flavour almost that you would get with the skewered lamb at pacific mall. 

It was nice that you end your meal with a Melona bar. When we went they had coconut and mango flavours. Of course we got one of each. 

Currently it is holiday pricing so we paid $21.99 for lunch. Overall it was a good experience, they were fast with bringing out our orders and cleaning up empty dishes. I'd come here again to dine."}
{"text":"Went here a few times with some friends and then took some coworkers. Meat quality is very good, you definitely taste the difference when compared to other ayce bbq places. Price is a bit high to be honest, but again you're paying for better meat quality. They serve melona as desserts which is great for those who love it. Reservations is only for 6+ and there's a 2 hour eating window limit. They will rush and tell you to hurry up when you're reaching the 2 hour window. This would be a once in a long while kinda of eating."}
{"text":"Amazing experience!

I loved everything about this place. The only thing I can complain about is that they don't take reservations. 

Meat quality is excellent and the marinades are super flavourful without overpowering the meat itself. I love the sides that are available as well - the coleslaw is my favourite! Even the creme brulee was surprisingly velvety and creamy.

I really believe this is the best Japanese BBQ place in Toronto period. The fact that it's AYCEis just a huge added bonus."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday. The food was really good (creme brûlée was amazing) and the staff, especially Ryan was super awesome and friendly. Great place to check out!"}
{"text":"????????????????
??????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

I didn't like staff, they took empty dishes with saying anything, push inside to promote to eat. It was annoying.
Mushroom was not good and sprout looked old.
Bibimpap quolity was also low. I recommend gyukaku than here."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Amazing food and amazing service. I love that it's all you can eat and everything you get is so yummy! I recommend also getting the creme brûlée for dessert because it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Man, for 30 bucks you can have AYCE delicious korean BBQ till your stomach explodes.

The wait is no joke at about 45min -1.5 hrs on a super busy day, I mean they are still seating people at 9:30....BUT so far this has been my favorite BBQ place in Toronto. They give you nicely seasoned meat with different options to choose from including veggies. Their meat was also very fresh, nicely presented. 

The service is friendly and are quick to change the grill when it gets over-burned. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"TL;DR If you like really annoying servers and constantly undercut portions with unclean grease spitting grills PLEASE COME HERE AND EXPERIENCE THE WORST!!!

FOOD (1/5)
GRILL IS TOO SMALL FOR 5 PEOPLE!!! 
GRILL SPITS OUT GREASE AT YOUR FOOD!!!!!!!!!!
THERES PLASTIC IN MY FOOD?????????????????

I mean it lives up to the reputation of quality cuts similar to Gyuu on Adelaide BUT the method of cooking  and delivery of food are what ails me today. My food was greased up in black so many times I wasn't sure if it was safe to eat here in the first place. Please refer to the photos. The marinated cuts were not marinated but sauce was splashed over it - not even reaching the other 2/3 of the meat lmao.

SERVICE (-9000/2)
It consists of everyone saying: 

\"You do realise that if you order too much food we charge you for it right?\"
\"You do realise that if you order too much food we charge you for it right?\"
\"You do realise that if you order too much food we charge you for it right?\"

AND THEN (after ordering 50 portions of kalbi)
I recieved 25 slices...........
SO I ordered 100 portions of kalbi........ I recieved 25 slices :)

Good meme guys.
\"You do realise that if you order too much food we charge you for it right?\"

Thank you for the giant green piece of plastic in my mushrooms though guys love the garnish.


ATMOSPHERE is typical AYCE BBQ lets be real its loud and noisy and too many damn teenagers.

AYIKES VOID NOT WORTH X__X"}
{"text":"I have tried this Japanese BBQ couples time, and I think it is a good place for friends hangout. Their service is great and friendly. I love their black pepper kalbi and bibipbam (plz forgive my spelling..) it is worth to try."}
{"text":"I have been here for a few times already. A great place to have meat feasts. Comparing to other AYCE BBQs, this one is more pricey.
They have a wide selection of appetizers, beef, pork, chicken and vegetables. Also, it has Korean Bibimbap and cold noodles!!  I personally love their cold noodles, the texture is chewy and the soup is flavorful. 
Recommend to try beef short ribs, beef brisket and pork cheek. 
They used to have salmon sashimi as well, but now it has been taken off the menu. 
Cost for 2 people is approximately $100 if you will be ordering drinks, if not, then it's about $80 dollars. 
Best part about this restaurant is that you can end your meal with Melona and Creme Brulee !!!! No one shall be leaving without them!"}
{"text":"Omg I thought Markham was amazing , but downtown really is now my favourite location.

I noticed that they've got about 5 more meat selections than Markham has like their Miso Beef Brisket, & Basil Chicken Breast. 

We definitely enjoyed our selection which was the usual 
Starters: Miso Soup, Cabbage Salad, BiBimBop,Honey Butter sweet potato and Enoki Mushrooms.

Meat:

Boneless Kalbi, Marinated Kalbi, Miso Brisket, Basil Chicken, Sausage ( has a sweet garlic flavor), Shrimp, Squid, Chicken Thigh and Black Pepper Steak! 

We enjoyed the seating here as well. It is quite comfortable, staff is friendly, fast, and efficient. 

The overall ambiance is quite loud, good decor, and they do a good job maintaining cleanliness of the restaurant/ ventilation, which is important especially with BBQ. 

The meat is so fresh and looks to be great quality. And the grills are much more user friendly as they aren't as deep pitted as most bbq places so you can actually see your food your cooking and not forget. 

Overall I reccomend this place for the Dinner Time AYCE menu. And don't forget to order Lychee Mojito! That drink is the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Although they have limited options for lunch Not much seafood and desserts on the lunch menu. Make sure to order lots cos the portion sizes for meat are small. So we had to order like 10 pcs, the only Seafood that they have on the lunch menu is the shrimp.

Same food choices you may see if you dine in AYCE korean restaurants. It's comparable and  the only difference is the quality of meat.

The server is the one who is going to input your order on the tablet. So if you want more food, you have to call them again. Some AYCE restaurants will leave in on the table. We paid $27 per person, and also. They only take Cash or Debit.

The dessert should be AYCE. But no, you only get one."}
{"text":"We used to go to Gyu-Kaku for Japanese BBQ in Boston.  The other day I was looking up good foods in Toronto and found this place. It was near where we live so we decided to give it a try. The meat was very good, they are very fresh. I was not expecting this kind of quality from a AYCE restaurant. It was amazing! The services was amazing as well. Just hoping that the we can have this in Boston."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the price and long wait time, I would honestly be preaching this place as a 5/5 find. 

After experimenting with Gyu-Kaku and other BBQ joints in downtown and around Finch, Gyubee has won my heart.  I have never devoured so much meat in one sitting! The secret? The house marinated kalbi short ribs. They are a gastric journey that requires multiple return trips!

Frankly speaking, all the meats are show stoppers, as my friends and I had different favourites that night.  We couldn't find a  meat we didn't like. Fortunately, what's great is that they can start you off with a serving of all the meats for you to try.  Plus, the staff members are extremely attentive, friendly, and generous with the rounds of orders. We were seated for two hours and probably did 8-10 rounds of orders! This is a saving grace because, when I'm at other BBQ joints, I often get a warning for the last call by the 4th round of orders. 

Additionally, I was never a fan of BBQ-ing my veggies, but Gyubee has mastered this. When you order some of their vegetable varieties, they are buttered and served in foil tin cups. Don't put the veggies directly on the grill and instead heat the entire tin on the grill. After a few minutes, you'll have a buttery and juicy vegetable side dish! The enoki mushrooms were slammin' in this regard! We did 5+ orders of them and fought for them! Seriously, order them during your next visit and leave dreaming about them in your sleep. 

Now, after all the gouging, you'll get to finish off with a surprisingly delicious assortment of desserts. For an AYCE menu, the creme brulee was a creamy, caramel heaven! My friend couldn't stop at 5 orders! Also, everyone is given a Melona bar with their bill for a refreshing zing to end their meal. They've really upped the ante from the usual mint/guava candy you get with your bill, really.

So everyone, get your tongs out and prepare to have that food baby because Gyubee should be on your next meat trip!"}
{"text":"The variety and quality of meat was good, service was quick and attentive. Melona bars and creme brule for dessert which I loved. The place was clean. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I find this one much better than the woodbine location.

1) they do not rush you or enforce the 2hr rule (at least when I was there)
2) they didn't limit us to only 1 melona bar
3) service was friendly and our waitress was always smiling 

Really enjoyed my meal there with friends, the meats were great although the grill seemed a bit uneven in cooking. Also another BONUS point, I did not smell like bbq at ALL after. I came fully expecting to smell bad since you usually do after having bbq, but wow I didn't have one bit of bbq smell at all! Very impressive :)

Only downside is this location is far for me since I live uptown but I def recommend this place."}
{"text":"Woah! I had no idea what we were walking into but this was a great hidden gem. The taste of the food and the unlimited portions were just fabulous / little more coaching on how to cook would be appreciate but all in all it's a spot you should visit!"}
{"text":"I will reiterate other Yelpers that you will definitely encounter a line of some sort during the weekends. I recommend coming in on weekday evenings and if weekends are the only option, 1-3pm would be best, which was when we did this past Saturday.

While all AYCE spots are generally lacking in the flavour department, Gyubee is definitely one of the better AYCE barbecue spots I've tried.

As first-timers, we pretty much had every single meat and veggie on the dinner menu. My favourites would have to be the pork belly and beef brisket, as I like my meat to cook fast. I also enjoyed the corn and lettuce wraps. One thing I noticed was that almost every item was heavily seasoned with some sort of sauce, which did deter from the authenticity of the meat flavours.

The dessert game here was strong. The Melona bar does a great job of cooling your tastebuds off after a hot meal, and the creme brûlée is also not shabby. I saw a table of 3 order 8 amongst themselves!

Overall, better than what you can get in most AYCE places, especially at such a convenient location, so I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The quality of their meat is much better than other AYCE korean barbecue. The only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because when i asked to order more food the server said a straight \"no\". ? but idk, maybe she wasn't allowed to take orders yet(?) nevertheless, i don't think it's good to say a straight \"no\" to customers."}
{"text":"First time having Japanese BBQ, and it was pretty bomb! 

I went for lunch since this place can be a little pricey, but it was definitely much nicer than your standard Korean Grill House-esque BBQ places. 

The meats were seasoned nicely and much fresher than expected. I think the most pleasant surprise was the mini bibimbap that you can order in place of white rice. 

And to top it off, the meal came with melona as dessert! Unfortunately we were only limited to one per guest. :'("}
{"text":"full house on Sunday during lunch hours. service was quick and friendly. Ayce lunch is $21.99 on weekends but you can opt for dinner menu during lunch for $29.99. A lot more variety with the dinner menu. 

Lunch menu was pretty good since I don't eat that much in the afternoon since I wake up late.

The beef brisket was my favorite. It had the perfect amount of fat and flavor."}
{"text":"It's good and I like all you can eat. The service is sooooo gooooood!  The location is also very convenient."}
{"text":"Meat quality 4.5/5
Service          5/5
Atmosphere     4/5
Decor             4/5
Overall           4/5
If you plan to come here, come with a larger group and ask for a bigger table. A line starts forming usually around 6:00 so come earlier, the staff is great probably because they want to quickly serve you for the 2 hours so they can get the next customers in. All in all great place to go to for dinner with friends or a date"}
{"text":"It was not a bad choice, but as it says, it was A-OK. Recommend to try if you like Asian BBQ."}
{"text":"Have to wait for more than one and half hour. Servers are pretty rude too. You probably want to avoid this place if you want to eat soon"}
{"text":"This placw would of have been 5 stars if it's not the limited time slot to reserve for a group of 5 or more people. They only offer 5:45pm or 7:45pm for dinner. Would still suggest you to come in a big group so you don't have to wait in the crazy line up. The boneless short ribs is the best!! Our group ordered 85 orders. The miso marinated beef is also our second favorite. Is not really marinated they just pour the sauce on top.  In general their meat quality is amazing especially if your a beef eater, this place will satisfy your craving. The cold noodles was good, it was chewy. The basil chicken was well marinated. The beans sprouts for some reason is better than other Korean restaurant. Our group of 6 ordered 25 orders of beans sprouts becuz it was this good. 15% service charge was added to the bill and if you pay cash you get $2 off. I would rather pay $40 at this place then at any other bbq place."}
{"text":"My family brought me here for Father's day but of course I ended up paying for everyone :-)
I need to start by saying how good the service was. The servers were all so friendly, quick, efficient and so attentive. Service was always with a smile.
There was a great variety in meats, all seasoned well and tasted delicious. Their house sauce and spice really helped bring the flavours out as well. 
I was pleasantly surprized by their desert, a silky smooth crème brule and a refreshing Melnona ice cream bar. 
My only complaint is the music is too loud....maybe my age is showing LOL 
Will definitely come back for more even though we live all the way out in Oakville."}
{"text":"We just Got trapped into a whole lot of awesome. I've never been to a Japanese barbecue place but I will tell you I'll be back. It's an unlimited buffet in Toronto Canada. They have unlimited meets including but not limited to shrimp, beef, pork, squid and chicken. We called in advance because we were a party of 10, we arrived about 10 minutes late and they seated us quickly. They got us waters and service probably. Service there is excellent and very attentive. We came towards the very end of their working hours they were about 45 minutes from closing got everything we wanted. We also got unlimited dessert which included crème brûlée (small size) and Popsicles. Crème brûlée was pretty small so each of us had a few. Overall I would say the meat there is good quality. You do cook it yourself, they just serve you what you want and take away the plates. There's also sides, there's lots of them but some of them include mushrooms, asparagus, corn, kimchi, rice, miso soup and so many more. I cannot Raven up about this place. The only thing I would say is if you're coming from the US to eat here either have Canadian money or a Canadian debit card. Otherwise, everything is fantastic and we had a great time. I do believe that it's street parking only. I think it's in a pretty decent neighborhood, we walked around and everything was great. However, I've never been here before so I wouldn't really know but the people I was with were great company so we all had a great time :) such a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"The quality of meats is definitely better than other AYCE BBQ places. Going for the dinner and getting sirloin is definitely worth the premium pricing over the lunch price. Add in the creme brûlée and it's more than worth it. I actually came here 3 times in two weeks!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday afternoon around 3 or 4 p.m. with a relative for the all-you-can-eat dinner menu. We did not wait long, no line up. However, when we left around 5 the line up was huge. There is a 2 hr limit and no reservations for groups less than 5. 

4/5 - FOOD: It was my first time at this restaurant, so I tried a bunch of different dishes. For the appetizers I tried the miso soup, bibimbap, noodles, corn, cold tofu and the enoki mushrooms. I would pass on corn, cold tofu, bibimbap unless you like it cold, and the noodles which were too salty. The miso soup was a bit salty too but fine. The enoki mushrooms were nice, make sure to put the whole tin on bbq so it becomes very soft. 

The main dishes are really good and get that extra star. I tried the beef tongue, kalbi, brisket, squid, shrimp and chicken. I have to say the beef was marinated very well. I liked the marbling on the brisket and found meat overall to be nice and tender. Squid and shrimp were good. Chicken was okay but may need a bit of soy sauce. 
 
For dessert, I had the creme brulee that everyone raves about. Also tried the Melon coconut flavored ice cream bar (limit 1 per person). I thought the creme brulee was good! It is very much like a creamy custard with a small light burnt caramel topping. 

3/5 - SERVICE: Pretty slow. I tried to order just a bowl of rice to put it in my lettuce wraps and asked about three times before someone put it through the iPad device and delivered it. 

To avoid this, know what you would like to order beforehand when sitting down and order all the appetizers and main dishes all in one go. Otherwise you risk waiting a long time to get another order going. 

NOTE - We were seated right in front of this huge garbage bin with only a wooden partition/half wall blocking it. Garbage was teetering from not being taken out yet and made me kind of question the health or cleanliness of the restaurant.  

Hope management addresses this issue and hires more servers to improve service. Overall, I will likely return but go for an off time."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Ryan, our server, was great! He was patient, attentive and brought our orders accurately and quickly. Free ice creams too!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yup. A resounding 5 stars. For the low, low price of $28, you can eat all the meat you can muster for the next two hours.

Gyubee has the best selection of meat in any All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) joint in Toronto. Period. For example, they offer three varieties of kalbi: standard, black pepper, and marinated. Even I might a consider that to be a little overkill. Unless you're vegan, you're going to find something that you're going to love here.

The accoutrements that they offer are also no joke. They offer the kimchi, garlic, lettuce and ssamjang for the Koreans, a healthy assortment of other vegetables, including two types of mushrooms, and some other interesting side-dishes to compliment the meat. They take this seriously.

With that being said, the line ups can get incredibly long, even during the weekdays. If you're going for dinner, I'd recommend that you come before the usual rush starts at 6:00pm. Even with how busy it is, I received exceptional service from their wait staff. All of them are equipped with iPads for quick order-taking and are generally attentive to your table's needs. When my waiter noticed that my table was running low on kimchi, he took it upon himself to ask if we'd like to order more.

I can't recommend Gyubee enough. Definitely not something you should be eating on a daily basis, but for a treat every once in a while? It's perfect."}
{"text":"I have been there twice on my boyfriend's and my own birthdays and both visits were amazing. You don't have to wait in the line if you go there before five on weekdays. Of course the food and the service are worth the waiting during busy times as well. My favourites are miso beef, chicken leg, shrimp, and sweet potato. My boyfriend loves everything, especially the sausages. 
Occasionally servers are so busy that they forget about your order, but the service is always friendly.  On our first visit, our waiter offered to bring us every kind of meat on the menu (it felt like an adventure!). You can't expect the absolute best beef with such a fair price (At an average grade Japanese restaurant, a few pieces of wagyu will be much more expensive than the whole meal at gyubee), but you can definitely enjoy fresh meat with decent seasoning."}
{"text":"Yeah it's a little more pricy than your average AYCE kbbq but it's worth it!!! 

This is honestly the best AYCE korean bbq I've ever had!! All of the meat tasted DELICIOUS and the bibimbap pairs really well with the meat. The best meat items are the short ribs, sliced beef and chicken. Did I mention the bibimbap is AYCE as well?? End your meal with a nice coconut melona bar and I guarantee you're gonna be satisfied.

Note: the cuts of meat are on the smaller side so make sure you order large quantities of everything."}
{"text":"We went to Gyubee on a sunday, around 7:00pm. The wait time was around 30 minutes. It was busy there, so be prepared to wait. I think it was around 7:41pm is when we got a table for 2. The people who came after (7:30pm) had probably about an hour of a wait time, for their table. There are coat hangers in the front, where people could have the option of hanging their coats/ jackets. They do have a message saying they're not responsible for stolen goods, and so on.

The service was good, I'd give it 5/5.  The atmosphere could get loud, other patrons eating, and grilling. Enjoying themselves. There were some orders being left out, we had ordered miso soup in the beginning. It never came, but when we ordered the 2nd time. The 2nd one came. You might miss some orders. 

The food is good, I'd give it 4/5. The marination of each beef, pork, chicken did seem a tad salty for me. 

A key note: Gyubee only accepts debit or cash. We asked one of the wait staff if they accepted credit, he said \"yes\". I don't think he understood us. Another wait staff apologized for the confusion, which is fine. We weren't entirely deterred or anything. After we had left, there was a sign at the door mentioning \" Debit or Cash only\".  I guess it would have been nice to have an credit card option. Oh well. 

Overall 4/5 for me. 
We found parking around Bedford/ Bloor St. (Green P) parking. It's about a 3-5 minute walk from there to Gyubee."}
{"text":"A welcome surprise on a cold winters day - each table has a hot grill to warm up with! Food was quite good - a selection of meats/veggies/seafood to grill up - and it's all you can eat (AYCE) 
I had a hard time telling apart the various beef dishes because the servers didn't outline them to us when they arrived, and would have liked some more dipping/marinade sauces. Would recommend getting a a small amount of a whole bunch of things if it's your first time there, and then order more of what you like the second time round. Decor is lovely too - very modern, understated Japanese detailing. Will definitely visit again when I'm in TO."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect when I went to Gyubee. It was my first experience for Japanese BBQ. 
This place is great. I would definitely go back. The staff were friendly. The wait was a bit long but expected as it's recently opened."}
{"text":"I am almost always weary of all-you-can-eat Asian food... first that's not really a thing in Asia,it's a western concept developed by some amazing food marketer... which makes me wonder how authentic and good the quality of food being served is. THUS FAR, I had not been wrong in my assumption (Korean Grill house I am looking at you), until today.

I don't think I ever ate for 4 hours in a row until this day; yes, you can call me a piglet. my brothers will agree.
Even though the meat was going to just be grilled they came garnished and in perfect proportion you can try everything more than once. The marinades were excellent and they even offered lettuce (korean bbq includes eating the meat with rice and gochujang in a lettuce wrap) as a side but no gochujang so i just had kimchi with the meat...awesome combo. just foe offering kimchi as a side I would give it an extra star.
The service here was fantastic - everyone was actually working ,had everything you might need on hand. They appeared like food angels to adjust fire & change the grill so your food doesn't burn. My tea(extra $1) filled itself constantly. I almost died from the cuteness of the Japanese servers who couldn't stop smilbowing(smiling and side bowing ) anytime she saw us. dirty dishes were never on our table as if we ate nothing at all(this is how 4 hr dinner happened). 
MOST importantly though, you must try the creme brulee. The portion is small ( so u can squeeze it into your overcapacitated stomach) but I have yet to try a better one outside of fine dining...especially in an AYCE. They actually caramelized it with a torch and no bubbly top - just PERFECT.  if i knew it would be THAT good I would have skipped round 5 for more brulee.

after \"a meal\" here I made peace with my inner piglet. I really wishex I had a 2nd, maybe 3rd? what the heck...4 stomachs like cows do. But they probably will go bankrupt if I did. I feel like it was a touch more expensive for an AYCE but totally worth it for thed quality of food and service.

THE wss ONLY THING I DON'T GET IS... the menu is LITTERED with Korean food...even the name Gyubee is Korean...why is it called Japanese BBQ(that's not really their thing)?
not that  it matters. it could be called \"path to finding your inner piggie\" and I would still go back."}
{"text":"I came here last week with my friends and had a great experience so I came here again with just one of my friends today. Compared to last time, the service was extremely slow and the workers completely ignored us for 20 minutes at a times even though our trays of meat were empty. They also forgot a lot of our order and I had to stand up to ask our waitress where a certain dish was many times. Finally the bill came around and it was a completely new male worker who gave it to us. He gave me the debit machine. I get to the tip option and there was no skip option. Don't get me wrong, I typically always tip, but the service was really off today so I didn't feel like tipping. I ask the worker where the skip option was. He asks, \"why aren't you tipping? Was the food bad? Was the service bad?\" I didn't really feel comfortable explaining myself so I just told him didn't want to tip. And he grabs the debit machine from my hand and say \"I'll be back\" and storms off. At this point I'm very confused. 5 minutes later he comes back with the same machine and I come back to the tip option. I ask him once again, \"how do I skip this?\" He does it for my very with a lot of attitude. Next comes the actual payment. Typical I always swipe or insert my card. Right as I am about to insert, he grabs my card from my hand and says rudely \"you can tap\" and taps my card for me... umm who gave you permission to touch my card?? The receipt prints and the second it comes out of the machine, he rips it off and literally throws it into our grill and walk away without any sort of farewell or thank you. Take about shitty customer service. I was really disgusted by his behaviour. He wasn't even our server that afternoon so I don't understand why he was so pushy about getting a tip as if he even did anything aside from bringing me the debit machine with a side of his attitude. And last I remember, tipping was optional. The food was good but I am extremely hesitant on ever stepping foot in there again because of the way I was treated for not tipping simply because I didn't not think the service met my expectations."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best all you can eat restaurants in down town Toronto. Service is on point, friendly, and fast.  Food was of wonderful quality, and they didn't cheap out on the food portions.  Dessert was amazing too, creme Brule was delicious TIP:  warm it up on your grill   just dont drop it lol ahem...  Someone did in our party lol... or the Popsicle..   Yummy!  Make a reservation if you are looking for a table,  if not you will be waiting."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is top notch! The prices are comparable to most of the Korean-style AYCE downtown but I felt the quality of meat was generally better. I especially liked how many of the options were marinated in different sauces.

I probably would have given five stars but unfortunately, they misplaced our reservations. I called 3 days in advance to put in a reservation for 7:45, and was sure it was the right day, location and time (as I always try to have the person taking the reservation repeating the reservation back to me to confirm). However, when we got there they just added us to the end of the waiting list (which was ridiculously long, definitely try to make reservations a few days in advance if you are trying to come on a weekend night).

We felt a bit forlorn and ignored, but we ended up trying to be a bit more assertive and luckily I had the call in my phone history so I could prove that I called this store location for a few minutes three days ago and they were able to seat us about 25 minutes after our original reservation time. (Which I appreciate as I understand the walk-in wait times were crazy)

The service was incredible once we were seated. It was nice that you order all the meats individually by unit, and the waiters used ipads to accurately take the orders. They also came in super fast and no orders were lost (preventing the common over-ordering that happens when 1/4 orders get \"lost\"). This joint runs a tight ship and I could see that the booths were getting cleaned up and turned over in record time.

The drinks were all delicious (and only 5$, definitely worth it) and everything we ordered was fantastic. Our group was particularly fond of the marinated kalbi, enoki mushrooms, and sausage.

The melona bar at the end was a nice touch, a great sweet ending to our experience. 

It came to about 40$ per person for AYCE with a drink on a weekend night which was pretty worth."}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat bbq I ate in Toronto, also the price is reasonable (less than 30 after tax and tip). Close to u of t. The meat are delicious. Good price and will definitely come again"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Monday evening with a friend.  The space was decent sized and only got busier by the time we left.  The menu was decent and everything tasted amazing!  Really enjoyed the experience, would probably return if given the opportunity.  The service was decent, but we never really got everything we asked for.  Some items we ordered three times before we finally got it.  Also, every item on the menu is one piece.  So you have to order like 10 pieces of something if that's what you were looking for."}
{"text":"This second location opened up after the Markham one has been opened for a period of time.
No reservations on a weekend - you have to line up. Needless to say, took us about 40 mins before we got our table. 

I haven't been to the Markham branch to compare the two, but I really enjoyed my experience at this location. It's newly opened, and the building is under renovation right now since it's relatively old. Right next to UTS, I can see this location becoming busy with a lot of younger customers. 

There's a lot of different selections for the AYCE menu. NOrmal price on a weekend is 32.99 but grand opening therefore they lowered prices to 29.99. I feel that i would come here on a special occasion, but it won't be my regular joint (or else i need bigger pants lol). I tried almost all of their \"meats\" on the menu, as well as some of the sides:

Sides:
Edemame, your typical order, nothing special.
They ran out of cabbage salad, so they served house salad instead, with the sauce, pretty good.
Bibambap - i love this option, great pairing with the meats, and it comes with the kimchi and a fried egg!

Drink:
i ordered the lychee mojito and it was quite delicious!

Beef:
My first most favourite... Miso Beef Brisket. I think i ordered this dish like 4 times. Their sauce is ADDICTIVE. I don't know what's in it, but after trying it the first time, that's all I wanted to keep getting... the miso sauce does the trick - they have regular beef brisket too, which is just as good in terms of the cut of beef.. but in the end i dipped all my regular beef brisket into the miso sauce that's leftover :)

House marinated kalbi short rib is my 2nd favourte. LOVE the flavours. I kept ordering this too :)

The rest of them..... beef tongue, black pepper kalbi and the kalbi bonless short rib.. they were all very nicely marinated and flavoured, so in general I would say start off with trying all 6 of them and then decide which ones you want to keep eating :)

Pork:
Both pork belly and pork cheek were delicious! the seasoning isn't as bold but the textures of both were great! I re-ordered these as well.

chicken thigh - with the 2 hour seating limit, we felt limited to order this... but the seasoning is great on the chicken and we did end up ordering it twice, but it does take longer to cook.

shrimp - your usual grilled shrimp - nothing special. I dind't try the squid since rest of my table didn't want to eat it lol.

Veg:
zucchini - great for grilling and taking a break from the meats
mushrooms - they have enoki and king oyster. both were great, but the added bonus of the enoki is it comes in a foil pouch with some freshly grated garlic and butter... and the result is heavenly :) we ended up ordering 4 more of these pouches!

Dessert:
creme brulee - bite sized, and it's AYCE so you can have as many as you want... but for a bite size dessert, this creme brulee is quite flavourful and creamy... I did have more than one :)
Melona - it's only 1 per customer... and you get to choose between melon and strawberry. I did not like the strawberry lol... but I loved the melon one :)

All in all i felt the meat was quite well prepared, seasoned, and marinated. The staff did change our grills often when the fire start flaring up from the oils stuck on the grate. They ddin't rush us at the 2 hours, so all in all I feel i had a positive experience. At this price point.. it would be like any other AYCE place.. i would come here for a special occasion, but otherwise I don't think I will eat my money's worth, unless I grow into bigger pants :)

(FYI because they just opened 2 weeks ago, they don't have credit payment yet... only cash and debit, but they are working on getting credit card payment available soon)"}
{"text":"Dined here many times.always great experience and most times ends in food coma.
if u love meat and BBQ?this is the place to be?ingredients r fresh and tasty?the beef just melts in ur mouth.
some of my favorites include short ribs?miso beef brisket?house manrinated short ribs?enokimushrooms?bibimbap ?etc...
the service always good.."}
{"text":"Best quality food considering it's an all you can eat. All the servers treated us with care and friendliness. Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"I would give the food here a 3 star if I was being generous and the service here a 1. Stayed here the whole 90 min and only got our water refilled 1 time after we finished eating.....The grills here are also horrible, no oil which makes the meat stick. The only meat I really liked from the lunch menu was the kalbi."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!!! 
I  have dined here with my friends for so many times and I have never been down for any reasons. The staff always so nice and polite to us. Once time I had to wait for a bit long cause they were so busy and they  offered me a free drink after that :). Yuzu Honey Soda here is my jam,  highly recommended."}
{"text":"*Important: I don't eat meat only seafood, meat reviews will be from other person that joined me*

Came here for my friends birthday, the staff was very very welcoming and the seating is cozy and modern. It's a great place to chow down with a group of friends or to have an evening bbq with a friend. It was all you can eat and the waiter was kind enough to suggest what we order and she explained the menu. 

I personally loved the sweet potatoes (highly
recommended), enoki mushrooms, zucchini and the seafood. The food paired well with the sauce given to you. I also tried the bimbimbap without egg, it was a small portion but the sauce made it delicious.

My friend that ate majority of the meat enjoyed the variety offered, you might have to order a bit of everything to know which meats you prefer. The meats were sliced thin enough to cook quickly. 

The staff was also super excited to sing happy birthday and bring out a candle for my friend, I found it to be super sweet.

I would have liked if there was tofu to grill or more seafood options

Lastly, dessert creme brûlée was small but delicious and the melona bars were good too!"}
{"text":"First off, sorry no photos since we devoured everything before the idea of taking photos even crossed my mind! 

It definetely the most pricey AYCE bbq I have ever been to. It is also insanely busy! We came on a week night around 7pm and the wait was 30-40 minutes, and I imagine it will become even more popular as more people discover it.

Everything was crazy delicous, and nothing was seasoned or marinated too heavily. The cuts of meat were thin, and they offered an array of vegetables and side dishes that I have never seen before in any kbbq place. You order the meat by individual pieces, but if you don't specify the waiter will serve 5-10 pieces in a dish. Some of their most outstanding dishes were: miso soup, miso beef brisket, boneless kalbi, black pepper steak, and beef tongue. They also serve small bowls of bibimbap, which is a nice alternative to just plain white rice. The last praise worthy dish is their desserts! Which includes Melona ice cream bars and creme brulee which was surprisingly creamy and rich. 

The service was also fantastic! They were all super friendly and considerate, unlike most AYCE places where the waiters just throw food at you. They made sure to patiently explain how ordering works and were very prompt in clearing dished and taking orders. 

The ambiance is great. All the chairs/tables are set up like booths so there is plenty of privacy. The overall place is tiny, which really can't accomondate the traffic it gets!"}
{"text":"We came at around 6 pm on a Friday night and waited for 30 minutes before getting seated. The restaurant is super packed and the lineup stretches on for a while so you should consider coming here before 7 pm really. Most of the customers are students but I'm sure it's family friendly as well!

The menu is really quite diverse and yummy so you can't really go wrong with the dishes. I do recommend the beef dishes more though and it's up to 10 pieces of meat per person for each dish. The desserts were pretty good too, you can have as much créme brûlée as you'd like but it's 1 melona bar per person. 

Of course it's a pretty new restaurant so the service can be hit and miss at times. The staff was really nice but they messed up our orders a few times (gave us the wrong meat, gave us extra desserts, etc) which I'm sure they'll smooth out within the next few weeks. Anyway I would definitely come back on a weekday at a less busy hour."}
{"text":"Great service and food but it suck if you are visiting from another country. They only take Canadian debit card or Canadian cash. So if you an American visiting bring CAD cash from the bank. I didn't find out till the end of the dinner so I had scramble to the bank to get cash which was pretty annoying. This place is basically CAD cash only...."}
{"text":"Honestly, I usually cannot stand DIY BBQ restaurants. You smell like meaty smoke afterwards, the quality of the meats decrease after your first plate, they forget half your order, etc etc. BUTTTTTTT... Gyubee is actually none of the above! I actually enjoyed eating here!

We made a reservation on a Friday evening for dinner at around 5pm, and I totally recommend doing so. There was a line forming already at that time! 

The service we had was pretty good! Our server forgot a couple of things at the start, but after reminding him a couple times he stepped his game up. The seats for our party of 10 were TERRIBLE THOUGH. We were seated at a bench table underneath that cow sign, and there was not enough room at all for 10 people nor were there even near enough grills. The people in the middle basically have no space to sit since there's a huge metal box on the ground for the grills' heating units (? or gas whatever) - super uncomfortable seating. Also 2 grills on each end of the table for 10 people? NAH, there needs to be at least one more in the middle. 

Food-wise... The cuts of meat from Gyubee are definitely WAY BETTER than places like Chako or Korean Grill House. AND they are actually marinated with different sauces unlike the aforementioned. I love that they have a variety of veggies available too. The corn and enoki mushrooms are bomb, but they're not healthy at all - they're drowned in butter so def not eating veg for the health benefits here. However, the seafood here is definitely lacking. They only have squid and shrimp... so cheap stuff that overcooks extremely easily. They also have a pretty good variety of side dishes here - bibimbap, cold noodles, and salad. The creme brulee for dessert was pretty good too surprisingly.

OH... PRO TIP THO: SAVE the butter-filled tin from the corn/enoki, PUT it on the grill, then ADD food to the heated butter to cook = POACHED IN BUTTERY HEAVEN. 
OH... PRO TIP X2 THO: ORDER bibimbap, ADD grilled meat to bibimbap (cus it has no meat in it). 

Other than the not-so-good seats, I would definitely return with a smaller party so we are all seated more comfortably next time! 

FYI... the prices here are slightly cheaper than the one in Markham (at least they were when we went a couple of weeks ago)."}
{"text":"Out of all the table-top AYCE bbq places downtown, this is by far the best. The price is slightly more expensive but the quality of the beef is amazing. Also unlike the other places, the price already includes various vegetables for grilling and lettuce wrap, and a bar of Melona to round off the meal.

The grill is better than other places in that it's a thin wire mesh so not as much burnt bits from previous grilling will get on the new piece. They are also very quick to change them upon request. The beef tongue burns the fastest since it's sliced extremely thinly. One fun way to eat the beef tongue is to cook it with the buttery enoki mushroom in the foil tin; won't burn and covered in buttery goodness. The sweet potato gets much better after you grill it for a while and all the liquids reduce so that you get a super sticky and sweet coating. The black pepper kalbi is just covered in pepper, which was a bit too much for me. My favorite thing to grill were the marinated kalbi short ribs, and the asparagus. Don't skip on the asparagus! They are amazing grilled. The bibimbap and cold noodles were disappointing, but that's not their main focus so it's forgivable. 

I have no complaints about the service, other than one off phenomenon. When you first order, they are stickler for asking how many pieces of everything you would like to order since they count by piece rather than plated portion. In the later orders, they will stop asking and bring out larger amounts. I made the mistake of not specifying how many shrimps for our third round of orders expecting 2 or 4, but they brought out a plate of 10. I did end up finishing but with much regret. 

Overall, a great experience. But 4 stars because the sides were very forgettable, one of the 3 orders of lettuce we got was completely wilted and old looking, AND I was sad that they ran out of the melon flavored Melona."}
{"text":"Strongly recommend for bbq. Beef here is seasoned well. Good service. The only thing is everlasting waiting time."}
{"text":"Great service from the whole team!
Very quick, always filled our water, helped us out (first timers).
The server suggested for our first time a sampler platter they had. We got a little bit of every meat and veggie they had on the dinner menu. We dedicated not to try the appetizers. After that, we selected a few of the ones we liked best. That included the miso beef, marinated ribs, enoki mushrooms, and buttery sweet potato. (we also enjoyed the garlic spinach and brisket but ran out of room). We were a little confused with the veggies in metal foil, but once we got it, we loved it all!! Brilliant. It's a great addition to just plain grilled veggies. 
The sauce and seasoning on the table were both tasty. The sauce which looked like soy sauce had a very light/mild flavour which was not too salty. It tasted a bit like cooking wine. The red seasoning was a blend of spices that I think included paprika and Cajun.
I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THE CRÈME BRULE AND WOW IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!! IT WAS SO CREAMY. The top was still sugary grains but still had the classic crunchy top. We did have to wait 5-10 mins for it as they ran out. We also ate melona, they had coconut and mango.
The grill which is like a fine metal net is different from the cast iron grill at kbbq.
Note: the first time I walked in, we were turned away as there was already a long line and they said they weren't taking any more people because the line had to clear and the people in line needed time to eat. We came 1.5hrs before closing on a Friday. When we came on Wednesday at 6pm, we were told the wait was 45 mins. The venue is surprisingly big.
One star lost because some of the beef cuts had zero taste and were a little tough. The chicken was also not very unique or special. The spare ribs didn't have any bones though!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic place to dine out. I had at least one of all their meats, and they were all tender and juicy. You won't be disappointed. One problem we encountered was that they don't take reservations for less than 6 people, and we had to wait for around an hour after arriving at the restaurant. We went on a weekday night so it's probably even more crowded on the weekend. Make a reservation of you can."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is slow. 15% taxes is mandatory. Cash or debit payment only. 

The food is good and comparable to their location on Woodbine but I'd say service is much slower than their original location even when I came here for lunch on a relatively slower when not all tables were taken. The best are the house marinated kalbi, sausage and shrimp. 

What really annoyed me is that their gratuity is added post-tax and it does not say on your bill but they tell you verbally that they add 15% on top of the bill. I think gratuity should be based on level of service and if I didn't think that the service warranted a 15% post-tax (which is technically 18% pre-tax) gratuity, then it should be my option to pay what I think the service deserved. I think the fact that this is not specified on their bill is also quite dishonest."}
{"text":"Gyubee is a great place for affordable Japanese BBQ. So far in downtown, there aren't many truly great options so the entrance of Gyubee is highly welcomed! The service both times I've been was great. Lots of waitresses attending to customers and taking down orders. Food was also pretty good and came very quickly. The store is well decorated and comfy with its booth style seating. Dinner is priced at $27.99/person.

NOTE: They only take reservations for groups 5+. Also, If you're going with a big group of friends, try reserving / asking for the larger tables with 2 grills.

I have been to the location twice - when I went as a group of 6 friends, we had to squeeze in and share ONE grill which made it really inconvenient and not as enjoyable of a dining experience as it could've been. When I went as a couple, it was a much better set up.

In terms of food, there is a decent variety of beef (kalbi, tongue, miso beef) as well as pork (belly, cheek) and chicken. Seafood options included squid and shrimp.
The meats are well marinated - my favourite are the two types of kalbi. I think I've had better meat at other Japanese BBQ restaurants, however they were not AYCE and were quite expensive. For the price, I really can't complain about Gyubee's offerings. 

There are also a number of vegetables to compliment the meat (enoki mushrooms in garlic butter is great!) Appetizers include kimchi and bean sprout - which are good as palette cleansers. They also offer mini versions of Korean bibimbap and cold noodles which is nice so you don't have to get a full meal.

Overall, I know I'll definitely be back. The seating is booth style and it's a great place to share a meal with friends. There is a two hour policy in place which is fair but just make sure you get a table with more than 1 grill if there are more than 4 of you going."}
{"text":"I've been to Gyubee twice for dinner (last December & this January).

First visit, my friends & I agreed to order most of the menu, but kind of regretted ordering all of the vegetables. I don't recommend trying grilled asparagus, white mushrooms and zucchini only because I prefer more flavour. 

When you do order, I suggest 3-4 pieces for the seafood, and 4-8 pieces for the meat per person* ..first visit I had small pieces of meat for the first round, then the second round the pieces were bigger which surprised me. Second visit, they gave more than what was ordered for just 2 people so we only had one round.

My favourite meat was all of the beef (minus the beef tongue). Can you say, beef bacon because that's basically what it is! One bowl of steamed rice is plenty for me only because there was also lettuce that you can wrap the meat in. AYCE bibimbap is a bonus if you love spicy. 

The creme brûlée is small, but still good. Melona Bar is a great way to end the meal & cool off from grilling your food haha. It's only one bar per person & don't forget to ask what are the flavours (I love coconut and melon).

As for drinks, I tried the peach mojito without alcohol which is $5 (extra $2 if you want alcohol with it) & it was really good! There is also free refills for $3 soda drinks. 

So far this location doesn't take reservations so it is just walk in. First time I only waited 10 min on a Friday, second time I had to wait half an hour on a Thursday. 

Overall the service was good, no complaints both times. I prefer to go to here than Korean Grill despite the price because it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been craving BBQ'ed meat for quite some time now. My friend and I decided to hit up good old Gyubee - which is right down the street from our campus. 

Being professionals now at ordering at the AYCE restaurant, we went straight to ordering all the yummy meats. A huge shout out to the service at the restaurant! They really handled our orders accurately and in a timely manner. They were also kind enough to change the grill when it got really burnt. 

My favourite meat was Kalbi. It was sweet and very tender. The pork belly, beef brisket, and sausage were also flavourful. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the basil chicken. It tasted very bland and dry. I love to enjoy my meat with a bowl of bibimbap and kimchi and miso soup on the side.

One thing I do need to note is that there is a 90 minute seating period so I was quite disappointed when they eventually announced our final call to order. I really hate rushing to eat."}
{"text":"Awesome Japanese BBQ restaurant! The quality of the food is undoubtably great. The service is mostly good and the price is reasonable. The restaurant only accepts cash and debit and gives a discount if paying cash. Would recommend to make a reservation before going. (Ps: they charge at least a 15% service fee if 5 or more people are eating together)"}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese BBQ place. It was my first time experiencing Japanese bbq as I usually only go to Korean places but this is my new favourite spot. All you can eat for $33 per person for dinner and it is literally all you can eat for 2 hours. They bring out food right away and encourage you to order more. I ate mostly beef and pork but everything is well seasoned. The servers were so friendly and attentive- they asked if I wanted to order more before I could even finish my first round. I recommend this place to everyone and I will be going again very soon!"}
{"text":"It's simply the BEST AYCE BBQ. We went on a weekday evening around 745-800pm, only had to wait about 10 mins for 2 people. They had a notice asking you to \"check-in\" with the receptionist. You should stay put and wait inside rather than outside the store as if your name was called a few times and no answer, they would pass on to the next person. There's a coat hanger at the front to keep your jacket out of the smoke. We were seated at the back of the restaurant, the A/C was quite chilly. 

It required a bit of a wait once you ordered from a selection of meats. It was not a lot of choices but the qualities were definitely better than other table BBQ and they were also a bit thicker cuts too. The only issue was the beef tongue, they were paper thin!! I would like to taste the beef flavour, thank you very much. Also, the store has their special marinate beef with miso. The marinate was tasty and sweet, but I would much rather cook that on a Korean table BBQ as the sauce would not catch fire as it dripped and burn the meat. My boyfriend almost burnt his hand. 

I would definitely come back as compare to the Woodbine branch. It is a dollar or two cheaper, makes it weekdays ($27.99) and weekends ($29.99)."}
{"text":"This has been a pleasant surprise for date night. Food was amazing, staff was on point. Can't ask for anything different. Thanks Gyubee!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Wednesday evening. It's a 5 minute walk from our office. We were a group of 5 people. We started with the miso soup which is way too salty. Their bibimbap is basically just rice with egg and what seems to be like ketchup. Oh and guess what? There's only one grill. There is literally just one grill for a group of 5 people! We were here to eat and not just chitchat. They were pretty good when it comes to bringing your order though. It's the only good thing I can say but it takes forever to cook them. After a short while, the server seriously asked us if we're done because we're only allowed to stay for 2 hours.. we were surprised, we thought she was joking and we almost laughed. 

Anyway, I am definitely NOT COMING BACK here and I'm sure I can speak for my friends too. No matter how close this place is to my workplace, we'd rather go someplace else. Take note, there's a 15% gratuity for a group of 5 or more. We paid 37 dollars each for a few pieces of meat that we had to eat in a rush because of the 2 hour rule. Just a tip for Gyubee: add a freaking grill on the table and don't rush your customers because if you continue doing this, you're going to be just like any other restaurants out there who will be bankrupted soon."}
{"text":"Seen this place on blog.to and wanted to try it. Came here at lunch with the three girlfriends because we were at Yorkville. Overall the service was quick, price was $20 for lunch and had great selection for that price."}
{"text":"The service and food was good. Although, the meat slices were cut so small that when we put them on the grill it just fell through. This place would be much better if they served food in bigger portions."}
{"text":"Step aside Korean grill house, theres new grilling royalty in town! 

What can I say about Gyubee, the cuts of meat are excellent and that is what truly separates Gyubee from any other Korean or Japanese BBQ place. The pork and beef were clean and rich with fats and flavours. The marbelling on the beef made for a super delicious dinner. The pork cheeks were incredibly juicy and the marinated short ribs were sjsnfbejejndksmndjejdnndn..

Sorry..

The service was incredible, fast, consistent but not bothersom. We got there around 8:30 and sat down around 9:15, I'd go early if you want to avoid waiting around 5:30 or 6:00. 

Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"5 out of 5!!

I love it here. For those of you who love AYCE Korean bbq, you'll definitely love the Japanese AYCE bbq. 

+ The grill you cook with is different than the Korean bbq grill and I actually prefer it. It looks like a net and it allows the flame to cook the food faster. You can ask to switch it out whenever you want!
+ Portion sizes are small but it's AYCE so you can order as much as you like - if you know you are super hungry and want a lot of something, order a lot of it at once to avoid waiting
+ Ordering works by just calling over a server and telling them what you want - they have iPads that they input these into for the orders
+ The miso beef is amazinggggggg~
+ The buttered enoki mushroom is too die for - my friends and I ordered this multiple times. It comes in a foil container which you put directly onto the grill to cook the mushrooms to avoid them getting burnt. HIGHLY recommend!
+ Their mojito drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) are quite yummy and flavourful - be sure to ask for less ice before you order because they put a lot 
+ They have this red pepper spice that is straight up addicting. I kept adding it to everything I ate. I dipped my food into soy sauce and then the spice
+ The Crema brûlée is some of the best I've tasted from an AYCE bbq place - very creamy 
+ They serve Melona bars as the ice cream dessert - flavours vary by day 
+ Service is EXCELLENT
**15% service charge (tip) automatically applied for parties of 5 people or over.

Overall a great place and I'm a huge fan!"}
