{"text":"Owner doesn't care about service.
We had a reservation for Friday night. When we arrived they were understaffed. 2 servers, 1 cook, no hostess, no bus person, no dishwasher, for a restaurant that seated at least 70 people. 
We got there at 7:30 and waited over 40 minutes for a table. Then we waited over 1/2 hour for water, bread and to place our order. During this time I watched 8 tables walk out due to lack of service. Then food took another 1 & 1/2 hours (meaning we were served dinner just after 10 pm) the fish was burnt so I sent it back. I talked to Manny (the chef/owner) about our service and he didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"What a place our waiter was the cook, bus boy, dishwasher and valet. Food was good but I have never been to a one man show like this before.  Thank goodness we were the only ones there from 6-8 that evening.  It was  Monday night but enter with caution."}
{"text":"Great place. Excellent food, decent wine list. Priced right, four of us with two bottles of wine ate for $260. European style service not pushy, let us sit and talk. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch and everything about the place was wonderful. The food was delicious and filling. The caesar salad was served authentically with anchovies. I ordered the fish of the day, which was served with a lemon butter sauce and generous amount of vegetables. Other people in our group ordered a filet and raved about it. Service was exceptional - the manager (owner perhaps?) was very friendly, in a laid back sort of way, lots of jokes and laughter. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience - great for taking clients to, if you're ever in the area."}
