{"text":"The service was amazing and our waitress was always there without us asking or waiting for her. But the food is not the best. It is not the worst as well. But compared to Montreal having many specialty restaurants you can find a better Mexican restaurant either in downtown or mile end."}
{"text":"Trendy Mexican restaurant downtown. A great tequila selection! The banana peppers stuffed w chorizo are incredible. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The Al pastor tacos were amazing, then I asked for salsa verde to put on them. Now that was the finishing touch! Definitely going back when I come to Montreal"}
{"text":"A very solid, high-end Mexican option for Montreal. We were very impressed by a number of items, including the Enchiladas Verde and the chicken tinga tacos. Very chill, comfortable ambience and nice staff. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I had the Enchiladas Suizas and my sister had the Tacos Al Pastor and both were delicious! My one complaint would be that the music was so loud that we had trouble conversing. Regardless, I will definitely be returning here the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great place!! The guacamole is made fresh and tastes delicious! Love the atmosphere. Glad this place opened up in the Old Port. Brings a wind of fresh air to the restaurant scene. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Incredible food! Didn't try the drinks (was there for lunch..!) but they looked very interesting. Highly recommend the Del Muelle Fish Taco and the Carnitas Tacos. Loved the atmosphere and the service was great. Very nice spot."}
{"text":"Meilleur restaurant mexicain de tout le Québec  La nourriture est excellente, le service est impeccable et l'ambiance est parfaite !"}
{"text":"This place is super nice and has a really cool trendy ambience, which is something you don't see often with Mexican restaurants.  Came here with a big group friends and they were playing pretty loud Latin top 40 which was really fun for us but would maybe not be a great place for a date night The food and drinks were a bit pricey but the flavours were definitely there and from my little knowledge of Mexican cuisine it did seem pretty authentic! I got the stuffed pepper which was around 20$ I think but it was delicious and I would totally recommend it!  All in all a really cool and authentic place that I would recommend"}
{"text":"Tacos were very good, they use white corn tortillas... nice garnishes & fresh herbs.  Service was pleasant and the Mariachi band was a fun addition"}
{"text":"Cute place.  Very attentive staff. The margarita was interesting- in a great way- because it wasn't that sickly sweet/sour I sometimes get with margaritas but a delicious type of savory.  And the food!  We started with the crab guacamole and it was really good.  We then had the queso fundito with bacon and chorizo and the alhambre al the pastor.  Both were incredible. The meat was seasoned perfectly- not just spicy but flavorful.  We were finishing up a week trip of the area and this was one of the best meals we had on the entire trip."}
{"text":"Our first night in Montreal and we happened into Emiliano's. We arrived around 730p which ended up being the perfect time because we were seated right away without a reservation. (soon after, the space started to fill up). Here's what we ordered: Me:  Drink: Mariachi Ingles -- Refreshing gin drink, not too sweet Food: Fish Tacos -- I've had better and I've had worse. Fish was seasoned well. Him: Drink: Coco loco -- This was by far one of the best drinks I've tasted! Definitely sweet, so if you are not into sweet, stay away. Food: the whole fish -- seasoned extremely well and it melts in your mouth! Shared: Octopus Civeche -- also seasoned very well spicy and the octopus was perfectly prepared.  We'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Summary The place looks great however the food is disappointing.  Pros Place looks great Good atmosphere and music Soup is good  Cons 1- tacos bread is not fresh and falls apart 2- vegetables are not fresh  3- portions are laughable  4- prices are  exaggerated   Conclusion  Pass"}
{"text":"Great experience. We went for dinner. The guacamole was great. We also ordered the pulled pork tacos which were out of this world. Furthermore, the pastor quesadilla was phenomenal. In addition the coco loco was a really tasty drink. The only reason why this place doesn't get the full 5 stars is their service. It definitely needs more work. Also, the patron flan tasted like it was burned. Turn off. But great overall experience & will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Went here for my bachelorette party. Quick service and they could accommodate 9 of us with ease. Prices were fair and the food was tasty.  The guac and drinks were also a hit. I will say, I felt bad for the poor girls unconventional uniforms, but overall great time."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying Emiliano's. My friend and I both had the lobster and shrimp quesadilla. We got there at 8:15 and only got our dishes an hour later. We noticed neither of our quesadillas actually had lobster in it. We had to tell 2 employees before someone got back to us. They told us \"unfortunately there was no more lobster but we will give you a discount\". They ended up just removing 10% from my bill which we thought made no sense what so ever. So basically, they ran out of lobster but instead of letting us know in advance so we could change our order (I would have ordered something else had I known), they were just going to try and hide it and charge us for it anyways. Overall, we were very disappointed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Margaritas were pricey yet nothing special, soup was tasty (and huge!) but served barely-warm, duck breast and lobster tail tacos were really great (at around $25 for the 3 lobster tacos, they should be!). Service was professional and prompt but also cool and distant.  I found the bar-stool style chair really uncomfortable and too low for the tables. I'm 6' 1\" and felt like a needed a booster seat."}
{"text":"Wow this place is just A++++++ everything was mouthwatering and highly enjoyable. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good time"}
{"text":"Had supper here recently with friends and absolutely loved the menu, service & menu. The guacamole as well as the margarita is as good as it gets. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Très bons tacos et quesadillas. Excellent service, prix corrects pour le vieu port. A essayer!"}
{"text":"Take into account I'm several cocktails deep here. Also, let me say the cocktails are yummy and go down easy. Apart from that they really are wonderful here. The waiter was very helpful and knew the menu inside out. He could give recommendations and explain the menu very well. We got guac and queso dip. I had a veggie red sauce tamale. The others had a chicken mole and a quesadilla. Best Mexican dining in Montreal so far. Flavours are great, atmosphere is happy. Perfect spot to unwind and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience at Emiliano's, really enjoyed our meal and the service provided by the staff.   Visited on a Tuesday night for a quick meal before going to see some live music on St Catherine street. Sat up on the balcony and asked to move to the back area as it was quieter and the staff accommodated without question. Started with the shrimp ceviche which was light, flavourful and delicious, nice amount of acidity from the lime and the avocados were soft and perfectly ripe.   Had the chicken mole and my boyfriend had the enchiladas verdes, which we both really enjoyed. Service was prompt, attentive and warm, staff were pleasant and helpful gave good recommendations. Definitely recommend highly for a lovely Mexican meal, good sized entrees and wonderful flavours."}
{"text":"Food is overrated and servers are right out of an old Robert palmer video. Very nice but robotic"}
{"text":"Recently went to try this mexican restaurant in the heart of montreal and enjoyed the food. The resto itself is very modernly decorated with lots of lighting and high ceilings. Good for groups, 5 a 7 or dinner for two. The food itself was tasty and would recommend trying their spicy crap guacamole and pork tacos as well. I would skip dessert. As for the service..it needs some improvement as we were a group of 10 and they tried to squish us into a table seating of 8 so they could get another 2 seating ...so wasn't impressed with that aspect. Service also needs to be quicker, warmer and more accommodating."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! We had green and red enchiladas. YUMM! Beautiful white Burgundian wine offered by the glass. Lovely ambiance. Ask to sit FAR away from the door in the winter. Or upstairs. They could use a heavy velvet curtain to block out that cold Montreal air! Thank you so much for the lovely dinner and good service."}
{"text":"Les meilleurs tacos et la meilleure guacamole en ville!!! De loin le meilleur resto mexicain à mtl a mon avis!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations based on the menu.  I generally love Latin / Mexican food, so when I arrived I was really looking forward to a nice discovery.  Our first disappointment came when ordering drinks...  They had run out of something to do their Coco Loco cocktail... strike one.  It was a Friday night so you'd expect them to be ready for the weekend... but alas not so bad it only got worse.  When looking at wines, they had also run out of our first choice...  Not a great way to start but ok, we eventually went to plan B and went for food.  The Queso Fresco was a nice dish.  Fresh, tasty, well balanced (would recommend it!).  Their Guac with chicharron was also good.  I've had better, but overall still not bad.  The tortilla chips were not great however.  More like rice cakes than tortillas...    We then ordered enchiladas.  Again had to go for plan B (for some reason, no chicken enchiladas available) and ordered the green enchilada.  We were warned it was a little hot, which was exactly our hope.  Sadly, it was bland, tasteless.  I tiny bit of heat, but barely noticable.  The kind of heat you get for a cheap fast-food burger, not what you'd expect from mexican.  Lastly, we hoped the pork tacos would save the day... but alas that was probably the least satisfying experience of the night.  Bland pork, barely any seasoning (save for the lime we squeezed ourselves) and a bit of chopped radishes....  tasteless, lifeless...   The service was ok, the waitress was nice and did her best, the ambiance overall was OK.  But in the end it's the food I will sadly remember. So many great restaurant options in Montreal, this sadly was not one I will remember or recommend.  There's better Mexican as well, and for cheaper at that."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food in Old Montreal. Everything is worth trying, including the delicious flan for dessert. It has an open second floor which is nice and the service is exceptionally good and friendly. Try the chicken mole!"}
{"text":"The worst drink I have ever tasted. Please STAY AWAY!! $15.00 for a nasty so called patron Margaritas. They put 1800!! One tasted more like extremely sour lemonade than a margarita, and the other one highly creamy! On top of that, they don't have half the drinks on the menu. To make matters worse, they don't have half of the food on the menu either, even basic food like chicken tacos!!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place based on other reviews and having walked past it a couple of nights earlier and seen it rammed with people. The menu is really appealing and their website and instagram page suggest that this is mexican food that will be a bit different from what you would normally expect. We ordered the crab guacamole and the queso to start. The guacamole was average at best, which was really disappointing. For a restaurant that boasts 4 different types of guacamole on their menu you'd expect it to be exceptional. The queso was really tasty and really fresh. For main courses we ordered the fish tacos to share. They were well seasoned and spiced, but I suspect the fish was frozen. It tasted kind of like a fish finger hat had been deep fried. That's not a bad thing, but you wouldn't expect to pay $14 for it! The vibe of the place was a little off too. I think they were maybe short staffed tonight and they just didn't seem to have their shit together. I'm going for 3 stars to give the benefit of the doubt, given the staff shortages, but our experience on the night was probably nearer 2 stars."}
{"text":"Met up with my friends here on a Friday night for a drink...ended up being pretty hungry after a pint, so went a bit overboard ordering some \"snacks\" off the menu as were recommended by our super-sweet waitress! I just wish I could remember her name. Anyway, the service was great. Food was nothing to write home about, but not bad I guess. Just typical overpriced Mexican bar/resto (\"trendy\") fare. I don't know who else was sitting out on the terrasse with us, but it might have been the manager or owner because they kept giving my us free shots! No complaints there. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the Old Port. First off, molé is is one of my favorite foods so I tend to be very picky when ordering it. Emiliano's has the best molé I've had outside of Mexico. Great atmosphere. The DJ was playing the popular Latin trap, reggaetón, and bachata so the wife and I were very pleased. The cuisine is authentic Mexican, but not your typical cantina food(tacos, quesadillas, etc...). Don't sleep on this if you're looking for some authentic Mexican fine dining."}
{"text":"This is not your typical Mexican restaurant. For one thing, they do not serve beans or rice with a meal, and they also do not sell these items at all. We tried the fish tacos and the shrimp and lobster quesadilla. The fish tacos were ok, though be aware that they are extremely spicy (and that comes from someone who likes spicy food!). The quesadilla was delicious! The portion of shrimp/lobster was better than expected. The quesadilla was one of the best we have tried. I wish the tortilla had been made out of fresh corn though instead of the typical store bought flour tortillas."}
{"text":"We had reservations for Saturday night at this corner venue in old Montreal and I'm glad we planned ahead cause the restaurant was packed by 7:30. The restaurant itself, with its small open kitchen, is on two floors and is plainly decorated for a Mexican restaurant; dark chairs, dark wood tables, white walls with a nice tin ceiling. They have a few seats available outside by the busy sidewalk as well.   What impressed me most about this restaurant was the food. We had three different appetizers including the shrimp cocktail, octopus ceviche and the crab guacamole. Our mains included the pulled pork and fish tacos. The appetizers were all outstanding! Nicely seasoned, well presented and perfectly prepared.  The tacos were okay but not wow: the fish tacos were better, the fish was crispy and the dressing was tangy, but found the pulled pork tacos too salty and saucy.   The service was a little slow to start as they took time to take our cocktail order but was great after that. Speaking of cocktails, you need to order the coco loco made with rum, coconut and pineapple; it was delicious!   Warning the venue is loud, like really loud, due to the blasting music which went up a notch closer to 8:30 with mostly dance hits from the 90's which wasn't what I expected from a Mexican restaurant priding itself on authentic experience."}
{"text":"This is a gem! The most amazing Mexican food you'll ever have. If you think Mexican food is all about tacos or enchiladas smothered in cheddar cheese, you owe it to yourself to try this place. My wife and I feasted on lobster and chorizo-stuffed banana peppers, and a whole roasted fish served with the most amazing rice and puréed retried beans. The dessert - caramel and walnut smothered crepes with blueberry left us surreptitiously licking the plate."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the restaurant - the DJ and the staff service!! The food was a great too, form the sauce, to the preparation, to the portion size and just the overall taste was delightful!   As a vegetarian enjoyed the Red Enchiladas a lot! I like how there were pineapple chunks paired w/ the spicy sauce really brought out the best of both flavors. If we hadn't ordered the Queso Fundido as an app I would have prob finished everything on my plate. The queso app came w/ melted queso oaxaca and soft tortilla -- definitely different than the typical chips and salsa I'm used in a Tex-Mex spot. It was a yummy app but obviously too filling.   The staff was very accommodating and was able to modify the Green Enchiladas dish to be made vegetarian. It was also very satisfying and tasty!   Will definitely visit again if I'm Montreal!"}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for an hour and a half waiting for my food, so I cant tell you if it's any good. The ambience is nice. Or it was before my butt fell asleep in my chair. The waitstaff is polite but whatever is happening in the kitchen is not cool."}
{"text":"Had intended to try Robin Square tonight but had no patience for a no reservation, line-up in the cold on a Friday night.  Decided to try Emiliano's based on Yelp reviews and proximity to our hotel, Westin Montreal. The menus met our various needs and likes. Service was friendly and attentive. They take reservations.  Our group of six sat on the edge of the loft overlooking the main floor. What a beautiful place. Loved the ceiling and exposed brick wall,  We had: Regular guacamole - delicious Crab topped guacamole - I don't generally like crab, but this was excellent! Three kinds of quesadillas - vegetarian, pork, lobster and shrimp - all great Fish tacos - delicious Coconut cake - recommended by our server. This was the perfect end to the meal. Light, fluffy, coconut-y. Dulce Des Leches crepes were good but perhaps a bit tough and heavy at the end of the meal. Chocolate tacos - loved that they had an option for dessert that was eggless so everyone enjoyed dessert tonight. The kids loved this."}
{"text":"Came here with friends about a month ago and had one of the worst dining experiences any of us had ever had.   The ambiance - seems fun, maybe to celebrate a birthday. The drinks - pricey, but just fine.  The food - awful, awful awful. All of our meals were extremely greasy (in fact, a few of us felt sick the following day) and significantly lacked in flavor.  The service - THE WORST. Nearly 40 minutes to get our drinks, about an hour later to get our food, and we spent just about 2.5 hours in total at this establishment. Our server was sweet and apologetic and seemed just as frustrated with our dining experience as we were.   Bottom line - it's been about a month since this incredibly disappointing meal and I'm still angry enough to write this review about it."}
{"text":"Incredible food, service and high-end Mexican experience in Montreal.  Great group spot and intimate setting with excellent service, cool upscale vibe and atmosphere.  Margarita's were amazing, the Tequila list was well selected and the atmosphere was upbeat with a DJ who wasn't obnoxiously loud.  Highly recommend the Guacamole with Spicy Crab, Ceviche, Lobster & Shrimp Quesadilla and Tacos.  Deserts were also to die for.  If you're in Montreal Emiliano's will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Based on the stellar reviews of my fellow Yelpers, I found myself at Emiliano's for dinner, a Mexican restaurant in the French quarter of Montréal, drinking a variation of a Manhattan called 'El Caballero de Kentucky'. While that might all sound very wrong to the uninitiated, there was something oh-so-very right about all that!  Let's start with the restaurant itself - classic Vieux-Montréal on the outside, yet comfortably modern on the inside, with clean lines and an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs do their magic. The bar, while small, is plenty comfortable enough for a drink before your dinner or if you're dining solo.  Let's get back to that drink named after a gentleman from Kentucky - this is a great variation on a Manhattan, made with Makers Mark, vermouth, and Grand Marnier. It's amazing how the Grand Marnier adds a bit of sweet smoothness to the drink, making for a perfect cocktail. If you like your brown liquors, you should try out this drink.  Emiliano's specializes in a more upscale Mexican experience, and the talent of their chefs comes through in the flavor of their food. I'm a big lover of chiles rellenos, and the one at Emiliano's is an interesting twist on the classic, featuring a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with spaghetti squash, cheese, raisins and pine nuts, and a black bean hummus, topped with a nice crema fresca - a simply delicious combination of flavors inside a lightly fried poblano. This is, hands down, the best chile relleno I've ever had. The dish is also served with a lovely pineapple and corn yellow rice, rounding out the presentation nicely.   The chefs at Emiliano's have come up with some masterful takes on classic Mexican fare, and the staff is very friendly (and kept me on my toes, with me switching between English, French, and Spanish at different times during the evening). In any language, Emiliano's should definitely be on your food tour of Montréal. Bon appétit... y buen provecho!"}
{"text":"I recommend not going here at all! They do not believe in customer service at all, the service was awful. They did not open at the time it says they were supposed to open, they treat you as if though they are better than you"}
{"text":"We were just there today.. The waitress was rude from the beginning. We were sitting outside and a mosquito fell in my sangria. I told her about it, and her respond.. \"what do you want me to do? Want me to bring you an empty glass u can pour it in there without the mosquito.\" Seriously disgusting service."}
{"text":"I hate to give 2 stars, specially when the food was good and the ambiance was great. But the service... Even though we had reservations for 20h15, we had to wait until 20h45 to get a table. It took +20 min to get the menus. My friends ordered ceviche and aztec soups and got their food in 10min. Another friend and I ordered mole and tacos and they didn't bring them with the rest because they were \"main dishes\" (???) even though we ordered only one dish... My friends had finished eating when I got my plate. It was 22h10 when I started eating! Being very familiar with how a restaurant should work, this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Montreal by far. Great vibe, amazing service and delicious, authentic upscale Mexican food. Love their tequila collection and delicious margaritas. Coming from New York, was taken aback by the quality of food and service. Great for dates or groups!"}
{"text":"Red enchiladas are ridiculously good! Tacos were also very good. Lots of flavor that work together well."}
{"text":"We were a party of three and shared two entrees and three mains plus a dessert.   We started with the guacamole with spicy crab and shrimp ceviche. Both came with tortilla chips. OMG the guacamole with the spicy crab was the best thing we had that night! It was probably the best guacamole I've ever had at a restaurant! It wasn't too spicy so for those who can't handle spicy, so don't worry. It's a definite must-have!  The tacos came in threes so it was perfect for us. We shared the Al Pastor which is made with braised marinated pork shoulder, onions, pineapple and cilantro. We also shared the lobster & shrimp quesadilla. There were two on the plate so it was harder to divide it. It was good but definitely not enough lobster. We also shared the green enchilada which also came in threes and is basically a tortilla filled with chicken and topped with cheese, sour cream and cilantro.  Lastly, we shared the Tres Leches dessert which is similar to a sponge cake with coconut shavings on top. It was good and light.  The drinks were amazing! I had the Calaca Tropical cocktail which is made up of tequila, farlenum (sweet syrup) and mango puree. The drink was very sweet and it was similar to something you would drink on a on a tropical vacation. I then had the Perfect Margarita. It's a basic margarita made with Patron. Then I had the Mariachi Ingles cocktail which was also very good and probably my favorite of the night. It is made up of gin, fino sherry, and cherry shrub. I also tried the Coco Loco (Kraken Spiced rum, apricot brandy, pineapple and coconut) which my friend ordered three times because it was that good! It tasted like candy in a glass.    The ambiance was fun! Around nine they put the music louder and played reggaeton music!   I would come back for drinks and the guacamole!"}
{"text":"Disappointing at best. I tried to order to go and they told me they didn't do that; then someone else got on the line and took my order to go, but they didn't start the order until I showed up at the restaurant--there goes 20 minutes of my day, for no reason.  Oh, then they didn't give me any salsa or cutlery for my to go order. Awesome, thanks.  To top it off, the food was mediocre at best. Mole tamale was funky and the tacos were average.  I'd say stay away."}
{"text":"Great food, just not for the portion and price. The guacamole was delicious, but was $10 for a very small bowl. $12.50 for three tacos."}
{"text":"So I was expecting a confortable cozy family style restaurant... this is not it at all. It's more of a trendy restaurant/bar vibe. Mind you, we went with a child and they made us feel very welcome. The food was delicious. The melted cheese with mushrooms, the various guacamoles and the lobster quesadilla were all outstanding. I did not enjoy the green enchilada as the sauce was to sour for my taste, but some people at the table really enjoyed them, so might have just been me. The service is efficient and friendly. All in all, very good spot for an evening out in the old port.  The place is on the small side, so reservations are recommended. We went on a week night and it was almost full."}
{"text":"Was not really in the mood for Mexican but decided to try this place since the restaurant around the corner had outrageous prices.  Was pleasantly surprised to find a friendly staff and cool chill atmosphere.  Since I'm alone I chose to eat at the bar. Margaritas were excellent. Went with the queso dip with chorizo for an app. Served with freshly warm grilled tortillas, not the usual cold chips you typically get. Very tasty. For the entre I chose the filet mignon. Not your typical Mexican thing for sure. Served over a lightly fried plaintain and bean cake with lime salsa. Truly awesome. This place is definitely on my must return to list."}
