{"text":"Went to this location during their grand opening a month or two ago because we really liked the food at the original location. Was very disappointed. Took forever to get our food.. for a \"fast food\" place. At least a good 30 min when they barely have to cook anything. Our orders came out wrong as they gave us some weird cuts of beef while everyone else had normal beef cuts. These beef cuts looked like the leftover parts that they just threw on because they needed to use it up.  They forgot about my friends order until we reminded them. Then when it did come.. it was so overcooked that it was like rubber. What is the point of having it on a hot plate to cook yourself.. if the chefs are just going to turn the beef into rubber themselves.  No wonder it took so long to come out.  Told one of the employees that our order was wrong and the meat was overcooked and super dry. They did not offer any compensation or offer to redo any of the dishes. Its very sad because we really thought this location would be just as good as the original.. but its not."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out to see if it was anything like the sizzling plates we have had when we visited the Philippines. And it's definitely nothing like the awesomeness we had in Asia.  The service was awful. We came in the restaurant and there were 2 people waiting for their order. We weren't greeted even when we approach the cashier.  Tip: you have to pay for your order first and then your number/food order gets called and you pick it up.  The cashier/server barely spoke to us. We asked if the meals had drinks included and she said yes, then retracted it and said no. Then while punching in our order she looks at her other coworker and asks if the drinks are included and her coworker says yes. It was the most awkward food order I have ever had. The server did not smile at all so it made it more weird.  The food was too salty and oily(really oily). The plate was not sizzling at all. It was lukewarm and both my hamburger and my husband's beef were dry and overcooked.  The place itself is clean, but that's pretty much it. Sorry guys, but can't recommend you to friends and family at all.   This experience just makes me want to drive to Vancouver and eat a sizzling rice place there."}
{"text":"Food here is reasonably priced for good quality food that is prepared carefully. Service is very friendly, and the place is clean and well kept. Would definitely go back to try other menu items. They also are on skip the dishes!"}
