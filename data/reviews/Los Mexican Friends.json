{"text":"5 stars because Enrique was the nicest person to serve me food in months!! the food was standard cheap Mexican food. good, but nothing special. this is the kind of place where you feel good about giving them your money!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos made with fresh ingredients.  The arrachera was great, but the Al pastor was amazing.  The waitress was friendly, prompt, and attentive."}
{"text":"Why aren't there more folks here? Maybe because it's a Tuesday for lunch lol This is my new favorite hole in the wall gem for authentic Mexican food that isn't smothered in yellow cheese. I love the \"cenaduria\" vibe. The portions are huge, the food is fresh and well made, the service was awesome and the waitress offered some salsas for my take home box. Clean atmosphere too. Don't be scared by the area just park and go inside!"}
{"text":"Officially the BEST Mexican food pound per pound in the valley. Got to go to the \"Hole in the Wall\" places for good food.  The owner is still the main cook! He takes pride in his food! Got to go to were Mexicans live in order to get GREAT food. Just come for the food."}
{"text":"If you get the big ass torta make sure to bring friends i could only eat about 1/4th of this torta it was so filling super bomb #prop203"}
{"text":"Came back for a torta and it was awesome. I ordered the breaded beef torta.They also added a little salsa bar. I tried each one of the salsa and they were all delusions and fresh!"}
{"text":"Living in Phoenix, Arizona for 4 months now, and have tried out a number of Mexican establishments, looking for authentic dishes, how greatly I've been disappointed? with the exception of Cafe Rio and Los Mexican Friends. Both of these restaurants will have me returning for more delicious tastes if Mexico! On the first visit with Los Mexican Friends,  I tried the Pastor marinated pork w/ pineapple Burrito. When I say that in lifting the burrito, it felt like a soft brick! Paid just under $8. For it but after tasting and size of burrito, found it to be very worth the cost! Heading back today to try out a different burrito."}
{"text":"I stomped on three small roaches while eating there. I told the server and the cashier and they both laughed."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times I was impressed by the size of the torta it was actually good I do recommend this place its got long hours and the food is great"}
{"text":"I work literally a hot skip and a jump away from this place and never knew it was there. Everyday I would drive a few blocks to eat at other fast food places and on monday i used my phone to find something new. this place popped up, i was hesitant at first because of the liquor store right next to it but decided to give it a shot. I have been back 4 out of 5 days this week during my lunch. im from california and have been here about a year and have yet to find a good mexican restaurant, this place is the only place i have ever gone back to that serves mexican food. easy on my wallet and excellent food! loveeeeee it"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and Delicious, My favorite choice is the Chile Relleno Burrito! ( Chile, Beans, and Rice)"}
{"text":"look...1 tacos on Wednesday..what else?? but the shrimp burrito is delish.. I had the chili relando or however you spell that. it was ehh..but the chicken and steak tacos are !!!!!!good!!!!! the salsa bar is good but they never keep it full. it's in the hood but it's worth the time. the people that work here are THE BEST!!"}
