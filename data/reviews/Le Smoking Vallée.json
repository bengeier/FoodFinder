{"text":"Loud, and busy.  Not my favourite but you can bring your own wine.  It's nice to visit once in a while but i won't be back for the moment.  The service is irregular (sometimes good but often absent once the order is taken).  You might find your bill to be a little expensive for the quality but you'll get over it and then you might come back, or not -  I liked the decor and the ambiance will depend on other patrons since the place is on the small side.  It does bring the neighbourhood a well deserved uplift."}
{"text":"Just back from a very enjoyable dinner here tonight. Every bite of food was excellent. We had a large party of about 10 people and between all of us we probably ordered everything on the menu (except the horse- blech). Everyone loved the food. Service was also great, very freindly and bilingual. Standouts were the lobster salad appetizer and especially this little apple sherbert and bourbon palet cleanser that was out of this world (please offer a dish of this on your dessert menu). At $130.00 including tip for me and my wife with no alcohol, the price was at the upper end of comfortable for us but I definitely feel like we got our money's worth.  Maybe I'm getting old but noise level is getting to be more and more of a consideration for me lately. For a fairly small room, this place is LOUD. It would be ok for two or maybe four people but with our group of ten, I couldn't hear a word from the other end of the table all night. The crowd was not rowdy and there was no music playing but the noise level seemed to have something to do with the acoustics of the room.  The only other negative for me was the complicated pricing structure which required listening to a lecture by our server before ordering. There was Christmas menu but if we wanted that, everyone at the table needed to order it as well as table de hote and a la carte menu's with slightly different items on each. These two issues are kind of pet peeves of mine and may not bother everyone.  Reccomended, would defenitely go back."}
{"text":"This place needs a serious front-of-house makeover.  With a 9pm reservation, we finally received our mains at 11pm...with absolutely no acknowledgement of the excessive wait.   I was marginally pleased with my meal but my three dinner guests were underwhelmed to say the least.   The state of the only restroom in the restaurant was absolutely disgraceful.  It was dirty and reeked of urine (we are certain someone relieved himself on the wall - no joke). I've been in bathrooms at outdoor concerts that were better maintained. It was beyond offensive.    I've given an extra star here for the owner/manager who comp'd half our meals on account of our very disappointing experience in his restaurant."}
{"text":"This has somehow become our go-to place when we have friends come into town. It's BYOW, reliable, and has great ambiance. Food is also delicious!"}
{"text":"Bon petit resto de quartier, idéal pour une sortie en tête à tête. Le menu change régulièrement et est assez varié. Coup de cur pour la pièce de boeuf, il y en a toujours une sur le menu, la dernière fois que j'y suis allée c'était un onglet de boeuf succulent et cuit à la perfection! Un avantage: c'est \"apportez votre vin\"!"}
{"text":"Sweet servers, cute and modern decoration, good but not perfect (special) food, a bit overpriced but byow. One time experience was worth it but nothing special. It's best to make reservations."}
{"text":"The pros: Nice ambiance Great presentation Small, carefully selected menu BYOW Service   The cons: The food was disappointing.  Some items were great but the mains weren't noteworthy."}
{"text":"Great place , hands down the best restaurant I've been at for a while , very clean and never had to ask for water once  ( which is my pet peeve ) , a little dark but was not a negative , nice shirt menu . High quality of food , bring your own wine is a big plus , I gave it a 5 star rating because I can't think of anything to say bad . It's a winner in my book :-)"}
{"text":"I went for a family dinner at le smoking la vallée. The service was great and the food was top notch my only issue was that the food took slightly too long to be prepared but besides that no complaints.   I had a great salmon intro which had slices of apples and beets with some cream cheese which was extremely flavorful. As for my main meal I had a porc risotto that was very well cooked and seasoned. My last dish was a creme brûlé, perfect ending to my dinner.   I would highly recommend this place for a special occasion especially if you are not in a rush."}
{"text":"Fancy for the Hen, but wow, succulent!!!! Casual vibe, sweet servers, nice design, incredible food, and byow. They have two seatings @6 and @9 - so it is best to make reservations. We tried the trout, tuna, and risotto -- all perfect. Great for special occasions."}
{"text":"First off, I would recommend a reservation on a weekend night. I am glad we made reservations cause it was packed. Their daily menu is on a chalkboard so bring your glasses if you cannot see far away. They have an assortment of meat dishes which sound very tasty. We started off with some raw oysters which was nice and fresh. They were prepared well meaning there were not any shell fragments in the oyster and served over a bed of ice (not rice). The restaurant is BYOW so it is a great way to have wine with your dinner without paying a lot. We shared a bunch of dishes and they were all really tasty, and I cannot say one was a standout or one was really bad. They only have 2 bathrooms (and each is in a separate area of the restaurant). So, you have to time your visits accordingly. The place can get really loud as there seem to be a lot of birthday parties that happen at this place, so it is a not a place to go if you want a nice evening with the parents or to discuss future plans with your significant other."}
{"text":"Being an avid foodie, I relished the idea of trying a new restaurant. After perusing the reviews I was eagerly anticipating this hidden gem. I can honestly say, gem it is not and hidden it should remain.    Foodies of the world, run. Run away. The steak is the most overpriced pièce of meat I have ever had the displeasure of buying. It was like chewing grilled fat with nerves and tendons, and that's being polite.  The service is on par with La Belle Province and the fried mashed potatoes actually make McDonald's look like a 5 star paradise.  The vegetables were worthy of the frozen products section from your local grocer.  Overall, save your time, save your money and please encourage à restaurant that actually deserves it."}
{"text":"I went there with some friends and had a great night. Food is average but portions are pretty generous and price is decent. For entrée, I ordered the homemade sausage with rapini which is not bad. I personally really like rapini and they made it in a way they removed the bitterness of the vegetable. My friends ordered the torchon de foie gras with brioche which was the special of the day. They said the foie gras tasteed bland and they asked for salt. Main meal I had a Islandic cod and it is delicious."}
{"text":"Nice space, servers are very good & BYOB!  The mango curd cheese soup even though it's an usual combination it could have been seasoned much more aggressively, all texture no taste.  Had a weird blood sausage pumpernickel combination that was not good, dry granular blood sausage buried under a pile of indistinguishable ingredients."}
{"text":"Un bistro apportez-votre-vin ou vous pouvez déguster des mets sublimes d'inspiration française ? Oui monsieur, madame, par ici !  Les plus :  - Bon rapport qualité prix (50$ pour un 5 services) - C'est un apportez-votre-vin - Le service est génial -Le menu change constamment et offre des produits locaux et de saison -Huitres !!!!  Les moins: - Les tables sont placées à L'Européenne, donc si votre bulle est grande, évitez.  - Le quartier est un peu bof, a mon avis - Planifiez les extras lorsque vous calculez le prix de votre repas car ça peut monter vite"}
{"text":"The food here was really good !! We had the table d'hote that had an entre a soup, a salmon tartar which was amazing ! the flavours were there, everything was fresh ! super super good"}
{"text":"While expensive the BYOW is helpful, and the food is delicious. Staff were friendly and attentive and the music was ambient enough that conversation was easy and no one was yelling. Great little restaurant with plenty of places to go after the meal!"}
{"text":"Never again! Sincèrement, c'était tellement bruyant qu'on ne s'entendait pas penser. La carte, pas géniale...bien que ce soit un apportez-votre-vin, je ne comprends pas qu'il n'est pas une petite boisson sur leur menu...Bref...déçueeeeee. Je n'y retournerai clairement pas."}
{"text":"We managed to get a last minute table on Saturday night. We were told it would be loud as they had a bunch of large groups. It was loud but bearable and made for an ambience. We very much enjoyed our meals here, oysters, soup, sausage, fish and steaks."}
{"text":"All the food was delicious! We went for a friend's birthday, we were a group of 12. The place is loud, but if you are ok with that, then it's totally worth it. Bring your own wine is a plus. The oysters were great, the tuna tartare melts in your mouth. I will definitely return.   (The place is similar to the Wellington but younger and louder. Turns out it's the same owners.)"}
{"text":"Superbe découverte apportez votre vin, dans mon top 2 à Montréal avec les Canailles pour la qualité, la côté chaleureux et le prix. Cuisine française tendance comme on l'aime, en plein cur de Saint-Henri ce qui donne à ce restaurant encore plus de charme. Parfait pour un groupe avec sa grande table pour 20 personnes, tout comme pour les couples. Service plus qu'impeccable, service rythmé, présentation originale avec ses assiettes en carrre de céramique pour certains plats... Bref à découvrir et j'en veux des nouvelles!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the Taste MTL set menu which was $19 for an appetizer, main, dessert. Pretty good deal. Not sure if I would pay full price for some of the dishes (the bill informed us the meals are normally $40 each), but the dishes were quite tasty. The only dish I was unsatisfied with was the carrot soup, very light-almost no flavour but dad said it was smoky. Not against coming back but wouldn't be a restaurant I'm rushing to come back to. Restaurant was full but also VERY loud inside."}
{"text":"Amazing BYOW, great service and even better food!  I had the table d'hôte which came with an amuse-bouche of beef tataki (scrumptious), a mushroom tarte with a perfectly poached egg and truffles (divine), trou normand of strawberry-rhubarb sorbet and whisky, tuna tartare with roe as a main (wow) and to finish a lemon-rhubarb merengue with cardamom crisps. Everything was fantastic and fairly priced. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"OK. I've been to Smoking Vallee twice. First time was pretty good, good food, good service etc. Went again last night  with two friends without a reservation and specifically asked at the door if this would be a problem. We were told it was no problem at all and to take any table we wanted. We brought beer which they put in the fridge for us. After ordering appetizers, my friend took out a bottle of Rosé  and placed it on the table. And that is where the Rosé sat, untouched for the rest of the evening. When our mains were served, my friend who ordered the Bavette was given a butter knife to cut her meat. She waited around 15 minutes before the steak knife she requested was delivered, while our friend and myself had already finished our dinner. Finally, to top it off, the waiter asked to us to pay as soon as the plates were removed from in front us, before we were ready. Then, as we each poured ourselves a full of glass of beer we were asked TO LEAVE as there was a party of 4 waiting for a table. Shocked, we had to chug our drinks and leave the restaurant. My friend put her full unopened-un chilled bottle of wine back into her bag. Had the told us when we asked that we could sit without a reservation but we had to be done by 9 as they had reserved tables we would have totally understood. Had the waiter finally come around and opened our wine, would they have asked us to leave with a half full bottle?  I'm pretty disgusted and unimpressed and I DO NOT HAVE HIGH STANDARDS PEOPLE"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time going there. I generally couldn't care less about the price of food in a restaurant but this was the most overpriced streak I've had in my life. I could do better in 10 min at home with costco steak.  The entrees weren't good either.  Everyone at the table is disappointed with their food. The service is worth a C- note. They didn't even know how to price their off menu items they were offering. There is clearly a lack of training.  Terrible, terrible. But hey, at least we're laughing about it."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money at this restaurant. 2nd time I eat there, the first time I was disappointed. and now here's my 2nd time.   OVERPRICED. We had a reservation at 9, bad service took an hour to order. Waiter didn't mind bringing us bread in the meantime.  Specifically tells us that the TUNA TARTER isn't good. I ordered it anyway. But still who says that. If I was his boss i'd fire him.   Menu is written by chalk on a wall board. Most RIDICULOUS concept i've witnessed. I was sitting agains't the wall so was turning my head several times to try to read some bad handwriting. 5 items weren't written on the board(menu) so the waiter had to tell us a 10 word plate times 5, we made him repeat several times. Do you think we remember with all the noise in the restaurant plus we were a group of 6.   Food was good, but truly overpriced for what we are eating. Took us 3h30 hours to order eat and pay oh and since I was starving i finished my plate in 15 minutes. so I wasted 3h15 hours of my night. Costed me 35$ with tax and tip for a plate of tartar...  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés à plusieurs reprises et jamais déçu. La bouffe est excellente, le prix très très raisonnable considérant la qualité des plats, le service est chaleureux et courtois. Bref, nous suggèrerons grandement ce resto."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant. Bon menu complet, belle table d'hôte. Je suis très content de voir un restaurant comme ça dans le sud-ouest. C'est parfait pour un tête à tête ou en gang sur la table longue disponible.  Super bon service.  En plus tu peux apporter un vin!"}
{"text":"Ambiance sympathique cependant la qualité des plats est en deçà de ce à quoi on s'attend en entendant la description. L'entrée de saumon fumée m'a semblé fade et le tartare de thon écurant (dans le sens étymologique ). Cependant la serveuse était gentille et le temps d'attente entre chaque plat est parfait. Un petit conseil: peut-être faudrait-il mieux avoir un menu composé de plats classiques simples et bons plutôt que de plats originaux et fades.  Enfin les prix sont vraiment trop élevés pour des plats de qualité moyennes. Dommage nous n'y retournerons pas."}
{"text":"Time and time again I come back to smoking vallee for a memorable meal. It is always delicious with fresh ingredients, great service and did I mention that it's BYOW?? What more do you need!!"}
{"text":"Vraiment délicieux, raffinée! Service attentionné. Je recommande! J'aime le apporter votre vin ça réduit la facture!"}
{"text":"This unpretentious byob with it's warm wood tables, comfortable banquettes, and low lighting was a great discovery! Located in St Henri, the simple blackboard menu of entrees and mains was not disappointing; we took the table d'hôte of 5 services and everything was good; the blue marlin main was excellent! The friendly service and affordable pricing convinced me that I need to go back!"}
{"text":"Dined here recently with a group of rowdy anglo friends and had no problem with the service, very friendly if a little absent minded. The food I ordered was delicious - the math of the Table D'Hote didn't seem to add up for me so I went for an entree and app. The squash soup with deep fried breaded escargot and roast garlic on toast had me moaning and eye rolling and refusing to share. The tartar with the crispy fried herbs and caviar was meal-sized and amazingly delicious. Not West Coast fresh, but for Montreal, really lovely.   The decor is chic, maybe odd for the neighborhood, but not ostentatious, and definitely comfortable and romantic."}
{"text":"Very good food and BYOW. The neighborhood is not the best but the restaurant is really nice. The service was excellent and attentive. As for the price very good quality for little price. I recommend this BYOW restaurant if you love French food."}
{"text":"Was there for a friends birthday. Was nice that its a BYOB but the menu is extremely limited and there we no options for vegetarians. Everyone I was with loved their food (they arent vegetarian). With people increasingly adopting a meat free diet, all restaurants should have at least one option. There was a salad on the menu but it was not meal size."}
{"text":"You know when you read the reviews beforehand and still decide to go, but within minutes you know you're up for a disaster night? That's me, tonight. All I thought was: I should know better...... where to start?  Service: all said by others already, rushed, impersonal, insufficient, uninformed, unrefined, goes on. I poured our wine, I asked for bread half way through, we asked for salt-pepper, not asked if all was ok, rushed through services, etc  Food: the tastes you expect are absent (goat cheese taste like butter, beet in salad taste like vinegar, squash risotto taste only cheese) and ones you don't expect hit you in the face all evening (green onion, vinegar, cheese). Ingredients are not fresh and we are in full harvest season close to local market (pickled veggies, marinated beets, bland fish, imported strawberry, grapefruit pie.....)  Price: over over over charged for such a poor quality, this menu lacks veggies (not talking protein style menus, simply half your plate is missing and replaced by more rice or a spread of bland puree for deco) lacks love and technique in execution  A rip off, who in this staff has had great food? Who's there for the passion of their profession? Who know's what a trou normand is (suppose to be) or where Normandy is?? Peach ice cream and bourbon..... never again.  We're talking about a $140 bill for 2. Go to Bitoque for local byob or any other place for good food."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant as a group of about 8 or 9 for dinner. The decor is a nice mix of chic and laid back. Even as a group we did not have to wait too long for our food and they did not make any mistakes on our orders. However, the girl that brought us our coffee seemed slightly irritated at the fact that we couldn't hear what she was asking us above the loud music and loud ambience. The food itself was good , the tuna tartare with herbs tempura was very tasty, fresh and well seasoned in terms of the tuna , the tempura herbs on top were good but they put way too much of them on the plate and after a while it gets too heavy. However, others at our table had the lamb and said they really enjoyed it. The prices are a bit elevated but what helps is that it is bring your own wine. Most people at the table were not blown away by the dessert. I ordered the creme brûlée and was very disappointed that it did not have any form of crispy golden goodness on top that is characteristic of creme brûlée , it was more like lemony liquidy pudding. Overall though, we had a pleasant experience , but there were just a few aspects in my opinion that needed some improvement."}
{"text":"Nous avons passé une excellente soirée au Smoking Vallée !  L'ambiance était très festive et le service était impecable ! De plus les plats, en général de type bistro, étaient tous excellents.  Seul bémol serait au niveau de la facture. Pour le tout, on calcul 50$ la tête pour ce type de menu.   Reste que le tout fut une expérience très plaisante et nous y retournerons."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for the tuna tartare because it came highly recommended and we wanted a byob restaurant nearby. Everyone in the resto was eating the tuna.   We started with six oysters. The ones from Vancouver were fatty and were the best ones. I had to ask for more lemon because they only gave one little slice. The tartare was good but almost tasted like ham to me. It didn't taste like fish at all and was almost a bit smokey. They put tobiko eggs in it and they put what tasted like slices of yellow beets on top. There was also mayo and thai pesto on the plate. I did like the tempura herbs garnishing. We shared a side of fries but we didn't finish them because we were so full.   The waiter charged us $4 each for sharing the fries and oysters! That is ridiculous! At least advise the customers before you do that!   I will probably not go back!"}
{"text":"Un des resto que j'ai le plus détester, le décor pitoyable, le risotto à la queue homard (il y a juste 2 petit morceau). Le service est bon 2/10"}
{"text":"Market Fresh...In My Mind     Dined here last night and had a reasonable experience(B.Y.O.W helped) but the food assassins seem to have a say in the menu.     Be forewarned, English is not an option. Our server was polite, informative and completely uni-lingual. I don't think he can count to ten in English so if you intend on going, speak french or bring a Larousse.    I started with the smoked salmon/beet/pear/goatcheese salad, which was arranged nicely and was an interesting array of flavours. Great job.    Then the BS started.    Our uni-lingual server promised us a paella for two with an arrangement of muscles, shrimp, rabbit and scallops with a saffron foam. Now, the piece de resistance of paella, in my opinion and amongst 50 year old Spaniards, who will fight with you for the bottom of the pan, is socarrat. Unfortunately, there was not a trace of it, anywhere.    Another thing. The menu is littered with risotto options. Duck confit, asperge blah blah, hence, I sincerely doubt they are stocking two kinds of short grain rice. I would then advise they stop putting lipstick on a pig and just call it fuckin' seafood risotto, not paella. Paella has socarrat     Misrepresentation of fact.    Also, I appreciate the effort that goes into frenching a rack of rabbit but if it is the consistency of a shoe, you have missed the mark. Braise?    Finally, what is the deal with foam? It makes me feel like someone took a straw, blew in my sauce and then sent it out. \"Doesn't Soy lecithin compromises your health and flavour anyway?\". \"How about you get my rice crusty before concerning yourself with half assed molecular gastronomy?\". I'll take a white wine/saffron cream sauce, minus the bubbles.    I know, I am rippin' them a new one, but shit, where was my socarrat? And $56 for risotto for 2? Come on.    On that note, our friends ordered the bavette and the tar tar with tempura which were both reasonably priced, well prepared and I wish I had ordered instead, so another try is in order. In point of fact, the sauce Espagnol with the bavette was pretty out of this world. It parted and held its ground like estranged lovers.    But for the love of Christ, avoid the paella in risotto pants.  waka waka"}
{"text":"Contrairement à certaine critique, mon expérience chez Smoking Vallée fut impeccable! Par chance, le restaurant n'était pas à sa pleine capacité donc nous avons pu profiter d'un service attentionné! Coup de coeur: Onglet de boeuf....cuisson parfaite! Recommandation: Partager la table d'hôte à deux....elle est assez copieuse!"}
{"text":"Came here with my Monday BYOW posse (I love you guys, long time!)  The neighbourhood was dark and bleak that night, so this place definitely stood out as looking like 'one of these things is not like the other'. It is a really chic, minimalist looking place with a lot of variety on the menu so there is definitely something for everyone. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and given that we were pretty much the only people dining here, the service was extra snappy.  I had the mushroom tart followed up by the tuna tartare. Both were done well, but nothing spectacular about either of them: the tart was buttery and the tartare was nice and not overly seasoned. I agree with Risa D's comment that the  math of the Table D'Hote  didn't quite add up, so definitely go à la carte. I feel like the place was a tad pricey for what it was, but I wouldn't say no to going back again.  Love the vibe, handwritten menu and service, but the food didn't blow my mind."}
{"text":"Le Smoking Vallée holds a very special place in my heart. As a strict vegetarian with very specific dietary restrictions and intolerances, it can be disheartening to dine in a meat-heavy bistro with a seasonal menu. However, the chefs here are always willing to accommodate me and the wait staff will bend over backwards to ensure all my dietary needs have been met. That's not to say they just throw together a salad or other cop out meal, either. Every time I go to Le Smoking Vallée, I am amazed by how delicious and creative my meals are -- even when I only give a couple hours notice they're able to come up with something incredible.  My boyfriend is a diehard meat eater, so Le Smoking Vallée strikes a very happy compromise for the two of us. Because of this, I decided to throw his surprise birthday here as well. Despite our large group and late arrival time, the party went over without a hitch and the staff were so organized and even accommodated two vegetarians and a vegan in the group (each getting a different, unique plate!).  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious seasonal dishes. And! It's BYOB. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Montreal BYOBs are a very much a hit or miss proposition in a lot of cases. One particular group of restauranteurs have seemingly succeeded in establishing a BYOB template that works. Marc-André Paradis, George Blais, and Thierry Dufour and Co. have a large of collections of restaurants that now cover most of the different neighbourhoods in the city. Their names are synonymous with excellent in BYOB and yet, I have never been to any..... a blind spot of mine to be sure. Luckily, recently, I had a chance to visit their St-Henri local, Le Smoking Vallée and see how it stacks up.  Le Smoking Vallée is a simple space decoded sorta post-industrial - well lit, lacquered wood tables, wooden chairs. The only real 'pop' element is a large panorama mural of St-Henri as taken from the Lachine Canal. The space is not that big and yet got very loud once full. I honestly do not recall music or at least couldn't really hear it. The service was very friendly but honestly pretty slow. It took about one hour for us to see our first course which is outside reasonable delays.  The menu is market, slightly french in style. Your options are either a table d'hôte or simply ordering per dish. I was hungry enough that I went with the table d'hôte. The menu changes seasonly and there are daily dishes as well. First up, the bouchée of the day was a mushroom tartar with a mayo and crouton. Solid start.  As a starter, I went with the mushroom puff pastry with poached egg, lardon and truffle. Lovely combination of the earthy roasted sautéed mushrooms, the creamy poached egg, the rich lardon and the flaky pastry. Good execution and great flavours. Very enjoyable. I also tried the cod croquettes with cocktail mayonnaise. The cod croquettes were nicely sized and had a nice crunch. The cod meat was flavourful and plentiful within each croquette. The mayo added a nice creaminess as well.  Following the starters, a little strawberry, whisky and rhubarb trou normand followed to provided a sweet but strong palate cleanser.  As a main, I went with the duck breast served with papaya, sweet potato puree and spice jus. Very interesting blend of french technique and plating but with some south-east Asian flavours. The duck was cooked perfectly and had great flavour. The pickled papaya gave the dish nice heat and the puree had a nice creamy sweetness to it.  My fiancé had the special of the day which was grilled chorizo and calamari served with chickpeas in a Indian-style curry. Very different flavour profile compared to my dish but equally as well done. Both sausage and calamari was done well and the strong Indian flavours came through very nicely.  Lastly for dessert, a chocolate carré with sponge and pear and matcha tea purée. The chocolate was very rich and creamy. The puree was sweet with the hint of matcha that makes enjoyable and not overwhelming.  All in all, solid technique and plating, great flavours and a comfortable setting makes Smoking Vallee a solid choice as a BYOB within Montreal. Service was a little slow but otherwise no major complaints. So if you want a nice BYOB, look up these gentlemen - there is a good chance they have a BYOB in your neighbourhood for you to enjoy.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed with this restaurant. The menu is one that we see at any other bistro. Nothing inventive. It's nice the fact that it's BYOB but the food and especially the service could be better. Funny thing...the waitress that opened our wine bottle held it squeezed between her legs, managed to brake the cork top in half. Our bottle was 35$!! Our biggest regret was getting an expensive bottle for this meal. I think a 20$ bordeaux would of been just fine! Like i mentioned, the food could be better but it wasn't bad! Don't get me wrong. It was well executed but it just lacked originality. The manager though was very nice. I saw him walking around talking to patrons and he did come and talked to us. That was a nice touch. Our bill summed up to a little under 130$. I doubt that we will be coming back!"}
