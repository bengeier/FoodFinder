{"text":"Hands down the best gyros around, pitas are soft and fresh, gyro meat off the spit, and great fries.  Big menu when you are gyro'ed out, wing dings are a winner.  Hard to go wrong with this menu!"}
{"text":"The best gyros we can find around - legit even in comparison to the ones at various Greek Fests around Cleveland.  Great all around on everything we order and we will keep coming back for more especially the baklava and gyros.  Good cheap find that has never disappointed in taste and friendliness!"}
{"text":"A local favorite. Great atmosphere, awesome service.  Not a great place if trying to eat healthy,  most everything is fried but very tasty!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but the customer service was terrible the cashier I had was rude i won't be going back based off her attitude"}
{"text":"I wasn't satisfied with my Greek burger. The vegetables were fresh, but the meat tasted old. The wings looked and tasted like they had been refried. I go there often, but the last few times hasn't been so good. I think it will be a long time before I go back!"}
{"text":"best gyros ever! always fresh & hot...& the fried mushrooms are pretty good too, i get the same thing everytime i go there!"}
{"text":"Gyros and more....or to us who remember Mr. S....gyros and more has an excellent menu, the gyros are packed with tasty gyro meat and are very inexpensive for what you get...the deep fried mushrooms are some of the best I've ever eaten...from burgers to pork loin the food is exceptional...try the baklava, it's fantastic.. The milkshakes are fantastic.  The ladies that take the orders are simply customer service queens, friendly, polite and professional...  The cooks behind the scene are blue ribbon, all the way..  Try a jumbo gyro, lg mushrooms and a chocolate milkshake.... You won't regret it...happy munching..."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Lorain. I must make a stop to Gyros & More, AKA the Gyro House AKA Mr. S ( if you go back far enough ). I would put up the gyros as this spot against the whole city of Columbus, save the old Apollo in the OSU campus area. The really understand that a gyro with extra crispy pita means a gyro with extra crispy pita.   They've got a diverse menu from everything like the Mr. Broadway \" cheese burger to slabs of ribs on Saturdays ( they run out quickly so you have to plan to get yours ) to the best banana milkshake with an extra squirt of banana you'll find anywhere!"}
{"text":"It's one of the best places in Lorain to go eat at! If you haven't been here yet I recommend that you come here as soon as you can."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. I always leave a happy customer. Best Gyros in Lorain County"}
{"text":"If you know me. One of my first stops is to get my Gyro with cucumber sauce. I rarely deviate from my ordering. If I could, I would have it everyday.  I love Gyro house.  Before they remolded you would be able to watch them slice the meat to make your sandwich.  A beautiful sight.  I highly recommend you stop by & try their food. Delicious."}
{"text":"Great place for a foodie.  The gyros are good, the wait is good the service is good and the catfish is great.  Recommend this spot to everyone who enjoys great sandwiches and food."}
{"text":"When visiting Lorain, I make always stop by for a gyro or two and a cup of fries.  Their menu covers a lot of ground.  They've been around at least since the 70's in one form or another outlasting most things in downtown Lorain."}
{"text":"This place is very colorful the food is wonderful the Gyros are fantastic it's all about the sauce at the service you order at a counter you wait with a bunch of colorful people all walks of life go here the doctors lawyers Landscaping Cruise everyone because the food is so good enjoy this place"}
{"text":"If there's a fast food restaurant that you must visit, that would be Gyro House, downtown Lorain. THE BEST French fries.... not to mention spectacular gyros!! They have a great menu! Yummy.....p.s. Bring ur appetite!  Ambiance is very casual. Be patient, food is freshly made! #satisfiedcustomer."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Large menu. Reasonable prices.  Gyros are good any where. I love the white fish dinner."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good gyros, one of my tried and true Lorain stops."}
{"text":"This place is so good.  I love their chicken club pita.  OMG to die for.  And their fries which I'm not supposed to have are the best.  Their always packed and people come from other cities because the food is so good.  Everything is good."}
{"text":"I love their food. They have THE BEST MILKSHAKES EVER!! YOU'LL LOVE THEIR FOOD. I advise you call ahead and order your food so it's ready when pick up"}
{"text":"Best place to eat. Gyros, chicken pita club, Greek Burger, chicken strips, fries. All delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Top 5 restaurants in Lorain. The love for their food has been passed down many generations. Everyone of course loves their gyros but my go-to is their white piece chicken dinner. Obviously it's hard to mess up fries but for what it's worth, this place has my favorite fries as well."}
{"text":"Best quick food to get in Lorain. No, it's not in the best neighborhood but I've never had any problems.   The ladies behind the counter are seriously so nice! I've been here quite a few times just in the last month and I've never had a bad experience.  I really enjoy their broccoli cheese bite thingies, and their fish sandwiches. I've had all of the versions of them and liked every single one. I do wish that they'd toast the buns though! (I bet if I asked they would.)  Their cucumber sause is AWESOME, by the way. Goes great with their yummy fries!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with tasty food!  Their prices are low, but it's not in the greatest part of town, so maybe that's why.  Let's put it this way... I wouldn't go to that part of Lorain after dusk.  Their gyros and sammiches are very good and they cook pretty quickly!  They also have a nice little dining room too.  It's fast food style where you get your food on a tray and go sit down.  I'm not in Lorain very often, but when I am, Gyros and More is always a good choice!"}
