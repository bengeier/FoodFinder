{"text":"I've been coming to New Gum Do for years. The food is always good!  The service is excellent! We dine in and order take-out as well. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a Chinese restaurant close by, so I checked Yelp...I
have driven by this place hundreds of times! Do not judge a book by its cover! I ordered General Tso Chicken with fried rice...it was great!"}
{"text":"It was crap 30 years ago and it's still crap today. You have to wonder how they're still in business."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Want legit food in a very casual place at a low price, go here. No ambiance but good service and nice people. I was shocked at how good this place was. Old staff that is friendly and move quicker than you would think."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the condition of the restaurant or the food itself.  This place is right around the corner from my place but I probably will not be stopping by again.  With all the new building going on around the place, I am sure it is only a matter of time till we see something new in this location."}
{"text":"Never again will I order from here.  I got the beef and broccoli combo and it was very good but the egg roll I got I was burnt and did not taste good at all!  I got lo mein noodles and mixed in them was frozen peas and carrots and the sauce was very off putting.  I also got an order of crab Rangoon and omg ew it was over fried and the inside was hard and brown not creamy at all they were totally inedible! So disappointed, I don't see how any of these positive reviews add up.  Also the guy inside was sitting there coughing and hocking up snot and it was gross!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is they have a good selection of vegetarian dishes - and the imitation beef & broccoli dish is excellent! 

I went in for take-out. Service was fast and so very polite and friendly. Everything a chinese place should be :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I've ever had. Period. Nothing close. I don't live in the area but whenever I come I or even come close, I go out of my way. They are a small family owned restaurant with the same nice older couple greeting you. This place is worth every penny (which is crazy low priced as it is) and I pray that it will be around for years and years to come since it has been part of my life for so long already."}
{"text":"This special gem goes beyond a restaurant for me. Coming here over the years is more like visiting a larger than life family memory...  I've been eating Chinese here since I was a kid. The food has always been great and the wait staff has never changed!"}
{"text":"Really love there General Tsos chicken. We get it extra spicy and it's so good. The fried rice is good as well. I don't like the egg rolls, but I've never had an egg roll I truly like. I will say that the two times I ordered appetizers they were terrible. The crab ragoons had a weird texture and didn't taste like much. The shrimp toast was one of the worst things I've ever eaten. I paid like $7 and I couldn't finish a whole piece. The texture and taste and everything was so bad. I don't understand how a place the that makes such good dinners can make appetizers so bad. For dinner this place is wonderful, but don't order any thing else."}
{"text":"One word, GARBAGE!!!!! I wasted 28$ at this place Generals chicken garbage fried rice kno flavor garbage Egg foo young oily gravy Garbage.. Never Ever Again"}
{"text":"Order from Gum Do EVERY time I come home for a visit. Love the pork fried rice and mushroom egg foo yong."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 20 years and the food and service is always wonderful. They have the BEST hands down Wonton soup and Fried rice in Cleveland. It is family owned very clean. Chuck the owner is a great guy.They also have a cute little bar. Love this place. A North Royalton Gem."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was in Highschool, and try to come back whenever Im in town.  It is the gold standard for Chinese food for me, and Ive tried dozens of chinese restaraunts all over the place.  My favorite dishes here are the General Tsao's, extra spicy, and the wantan soup."}
{"text":"This is a place we have been coming to for many years.  Nothing fancy inside, but very neat and clean and always great service.  Their tea is excellent, their pork fried rice and their soups are the best I have ever had.  Many great dishes to choose from.  Their spring rolls and egg rolls are superb with a delicate crust; pot stickers and dumplings good too.  Never had a bad meal here . Often get take out, but dine in is nice as well.  Casual and relaxed.  They have a bar-lounge as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in NR, and wanted something for a quick dinner. Since my boyfriend is very familiar with the area, he took us all to New Gum Do Chinese, and I am very happy that he did! You can either carry out or eat in, and we decided to eat in. 

First and foremost, the place was empty (we were the only one there), however, the service did not make it seem that it was empty for a bad reason. The second we sat down, the server was very attentive, and made us feel that we were welcomed. Though this is not somewhere you would come for a romantic date, the place was clean and had a really cool fish tank off to the side. 

The food was really good as well. I am a sucker for dumplings, and these were by far one of the best dumplings I have had (besides the one I make at home). They were perfectly cooked, and the sauce was really good as well. I had the hot and sour soup, and it was very authentic -- not something you would get at a \"fast food\" Chinese restaurant. My friend got the Sweet and Sour Chicken, and she said it was very good as well (and it came with Fried rice and an egg roll). 

There is also a lounge on the other side which has a fully stocked bar. Since the Cavs were playing, most Sports Bar were packed, however, if we really wanted to stay and watch the game, this would have been one place we could have gone.

Needless to say, this place exceeded my expectations for Chinese food, and the place was really good. Though it looked like a \"hole in the wall\", this was us trying to get a quick dinner, not a 5 course meal. For what it's worth, I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The chow mein noodles were not even cooked and their steamed dumplings were pretty hard to chew on and the restaurant was absolutely empty. First time i had to spit it back out. I had the sichuan beef and asked for very spicy but wasnt spicy at all. I highly do not recommend this place. Ps
You dont even want to go in the restrooms."}
{"text":"Was driving down 82 with pooch and spied this out of the corner of my eye. I think the fact that it said \"restaurant AND lounge\" intrigued me. I've never really partied in a Chinese lounge. The nondescript face of the building has echoes of the VTR. You're not sure if there really even is a restaurant inside. This place...man...it was like a kind of pulp magazine fever dream. While the dining room was pretty standard fare, the lounge is probably one of the weirdest places I've ever been. Smaller than my basement bar(about three stools and a couple booths), it is surrounded on three sides by said dining room. Dude had Chinese tv on and was stocking the bar with ice. This was at 11 am. If this place was in Tremont or Detroit Shoreway, it would be one of the kitschy treasures of our ever more ironic scene. Think Tina's niteclub meets a vintage bar set for sale at Suite Lorain. Yet, here it sits, nestled away in sleepy North Royalton. I can only imagine how freaky this place gets at night. Magnificent.

Anyhow, had to rustle up some lunch vittles for me and the dog. Ordered spring rolls, ten steamed dumplings and a lunch portion of chicken subgum. Fourteen bucks total. The subgum had to be a dinner portion. Huge. The dumplings were fantastic. Tasted very fresh(we ate a few on the road). A very awesome surprise to find in my travels around the burbs."}
{"text":"Pretty good food from a family operated joint. I really liked the shrimp fried rice until I found out that none of the shrimp had been deveined :("}
{"text":"Been going here for like 40 years. They used to be on the other side of the street where the bank is now. Always get the same waitress. She's old and a bit cranky but somehow likable. Don't ask me to explain that. I generally get the same dish most of the time. Won Ton soup (delicious) followed by the Chow Mein combination (including rice and egg roll) they also bring shrimp chips. I only get Chow Mein here. Nowhere else comes close. The food is excellent and brought to the table extremely fast. The portions are HUGE. The prices are very reasonable and the tea is good too. They also do a robust take-out service.

PS:
Can't understand some of the bad reviews?"}
{"text":"It has come to my attention that some of the information in my initial NEW Gum Do review may have been incorrect. First of all the shrimp do not come from Bangladesh as I had stated in my first review. The shrimp \"...they come from the store! The store! The store!\" which may or may not be superior than that which I had stated. 

The shrimp stew may be excellent and in my haste to be both informative and erudite I may have jumped to the conclusion that shrimp from the Indian Ocean are not fresh in North Royalton for geographic reasons, freshness expectations and the intractable nature of the time/travel relationship.

Also, in the strictest sense of the word, I did not in fact 'fornicate' prior to consuming stew from NEW Gum Do and the person involved was not in actuality a cast member from Glee. As it relates to this matter, my only explanation is that people employed at Home Days two dollar games of chance are trained to be deceitful and are particularly effective in the art of seduction. That the woman in question was a talented singer and had surprisingly life-like dentures only added to the ruse, my inevitble deception and now my personal shame and humiliation.

It only seemed fitting that in my hour of discovery I would turn to my five star friends at NEW Gum Do to seek solace and comfort in a tinfoil tray of stew and carrots carved into fun shapes. Only in places like NEW Gum Do can a person, fallen as I may be, be reborn.

Sigh."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie egg rolls, general tso's chicken, and crab rangoon.  The super chunks of general tso chicken were too large and bad pieces of meat.  There was no crab in the rangoon, and had the texture of toothpaste, and the egg rolls were dripping in oil.  I have lived in North Royalton for 10 years and I never went to this place.  The time I did go re-confirmed my notion that this is a typical greasy spoon that has horrible Chinese food.  Never again.  After eating at Chinese restaurants in San Francisco and New York, they definitely need to re-evaluate their cooking ingredients and provide better quality food."}
