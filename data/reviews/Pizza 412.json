{"text":"We ordered a bundled deal with pizza, wings and breadsticks. Remember the Sodexo versions of food from high school cafeterias? If you liked those, you'd like Pizza 412."}
{"text":"I've ordered multiple times and while the food is good, tonight the delivery driver tried to give/sell me a necklace...wth??? It was super weird, uncomfortable, and obviously uncalled for. Won't be ordering again. Get a new delivery driver."}
{"text":"Ordered two hoagies and an order of Buffalo wings. The Italian hoagie was really good. The steak hoagie was just OK (they use Mancini's rolls which automatically makes them pretty good). The wings were terrible! I thought buffalo wings were pretty universal but these ones had yellow sauce that almost looked like cheese. They did not look or taste anything like traditional buffalo wings. When I called back to question that I was told \"Those are our buffalo wings. Sorry.\" So we threw $12 in the trash and we will never order from them again. I can get a decent hoagie anywhere."}
{"text":"Ordered online.  Originally said 45-60 minutes.  Soon after get message my order will take an hour and a half.  Over two hours later the food arrives cold an not even edible.  What makes matters worse is that my order was not even correct. If you want to try this place go pick it up.  I personally will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Pretty sure they thought I ordered a 5 sauce calzone instead of 5 cheese. The bare minimum of cheese they did include wasn't even melted."}
{"text":"I had ordered delivery from them for a dozen wings. They said it would be here in 45 minutes, but then updates their deliver time out another hour and a half. When I called to ask why they said they didn't have time to get me my food in time. I said how a dozen wings shouldn't take 2 hours from the time I placed my order. Ended up cancelling after the women on the phone was rude, not even apologising. Would never order from them again."}
{"text":"Remember how in the opening credits of Daria the titular character raises her arm to feign effort after the ball has already gone past her? That's what my ordering experience with Pizza 412 was like.   This meal hit the bare minimum requirements on all fronts:  Ordered a Pepsi? Get a 7.5oz Pepsi meant for mixing.  Ordered an Italian hoagie? Get a hoagie with 1 slice each of ham, salami, and cheese. Tons of lettuce. Technically it's an Italian hoagie, but just barely.  Ask the delivery guy to deliver to your floor? Nope- go meet him in the lobby (understandable, but a bit annoying).   Flavor-wise, the hoagie was meh. Nothing to write home about, except maybe the hair.   All in all, forgettable and bland."}
{"text":"Good food, pizza has a decent sauce and they don't skimp on the cheese like some places and the crust has a good buttery garlic taste I do enjoy, I did have problems ordering, I called and the person taking my order couldn't understand me yet I had perfect reception and full bars on my phone, and it was really difficult to make an order, especially considering she spoke very broken English, so I just ordered online which worked much better, would have rated it higher if the person taking phone calls could speak clear English"}
{"text":"They got bought out by someone else and the quality just isn't there anymore. I'm so disappointed! In particular they changed their marinara recipe. It used to be creamy and a little sweet. It was different and so good!! I hate it now. Unfortunately we started taking our pizza business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered through Grubhub, they said it would take 30 mins, it took over an hour. When the food got here my buffalo chicken hoagie was so over cooked I could not even bite through it. Called back to have another one issued and the worker stated that, \"most people order their fried chicken well done.\" I did not make such a request. The worker was curt and claimed I'd get another in 20 mins. 30 mins passes, no sandwich. I called Grubhub for a refund, Pizza 412 refused to issue it. I called and the worker hung up on me and said because I tried to get a refund, I wasn't going to receive my sandwich or a refund. I cook for a living,understand things happen, but this was unacceptable ."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. We ordered the large pizza special with bread sticks. The bread sticks were really good with the marinara dipping sauce. The pizza had a thinner crust, but was still pretty good, just not my preference. The bacon was crispy and the green peppers were fresh. Overall, pretty decent pie.  Just as a heads up, we ordered online and were over changed almost double for the toppings. Keep an eye out for that.  Will we order again, sure. I definitely want to try the calzone :)"}
{"text":"This is a new place that went in where Dicarlo's used to be on Saw Mill Run / 51. It's right down the hill from us. I have to admit, we were pretty bummed when Dicarlo's shut down. But, when one door closes, another one opens, and this new place bakes up some solid pizza. Good pizza delivery is hard to come by in this neighborhood. There are the chains, and a couple mom and pop shops that are passable. This is one of the best pies we've had delivered since we moved here in 2009.  As for the toppings - they are all fresh and high quality. We ordered two extra larges, one with pepperoni, mushrooms, and onion, and the other with sausage, green peppers, onion, black olive, and mushrooms. My only minor nitpick would be that they were a little heavy on the cheese for my taste, but I typically like a lot less cheese than 90% of folks, so take that with a grain of salt.  As for the delivery, we do live about 30 seconds away, so of course it was piping hot.   If you live in the neighborhood (Carrick, Overbrook, etc.), you should give them a try. Support a local, new business! Next time you're about to break down and stuff some more money in Papa John's pocket, think twice and call these guys!  So that's it - thanks for the good pizza!"}
{"text":"You know when you order from somewhere and honestly expect nothing then your like woah, great decision? Yep. Nothing really delivers to my house so finding this place was a huge win for me. I ordered deliver through Yelp, and the order arrived exactly when it was projected. Food was extremely hot and honestly I couldn't even eat it right away it was so fresh from the oven!   I got the pepperoni calzone and breadsticks. I thought about ordering extra cheese in my calzone but SO GLAD I didn't! That baby was stuffed!! I'm really picky on dough because I used to work at a bread bakery, and this dough was seriously amazing. Perfect density and slight crisp. Breadsticks were also very good and you could tell they were handrolled and not frozen breadsticks from a box.   I will absolutely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Ordered through Grubhub. Got the notification that was my food was being delivered. Half hour goes by, no food. I call the store, said driver is on the way. I call about 20 minutes later and was told again, driver on the way. Called a THIRD time after another 20 minutes and was told the driver wasn't answering his phone!!!! Called a FOURTH time ( which was over an HOUR after the driver was supposedly on the way) and said I wanted to cancel the order. Why do you have drivers that don't answer their phone??? Never again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I got a pepperoni pizza and it was definitely good, I also order a chicken parm hoagie and it was alright, I've had better, but definitely going to keep ordering delivery from here."}
{"text":"As I drive past here most days and live in the area I was curious to give it a try when I noticed DiCarlo's had been replaced. Their pizza is fantastic! The soft crust has just the right amount of crunch. The toppings were fresh and delicious. The sauce and cheese were excellent. They throw in a little container of ranch that the kids enjoyed dipping their crust into as well. The Italian hoagie was large (16 inches), but mostly average. I'd give it 3 stars, but the pizza definitely deserves 5. Certainly will be my go-to for pizza delivery."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, won't ever order from here again. ETA was 6:53 and didn't arrive until 8:05, the quality of food definitely wasn't worth the wait. Everything was cold and the breadsticks were hard and burnt."}
{"text":"Ordered from grubhub said food would be here between 5:40 to 5:50 at 6:20 called the restaurant.  Said it was on the way and got here about 10 minutes later.  First thing he pulled out was a regular Pepsi and I ordered diet. The driver kept giving me these looks like he was hoping I'd say it was ok but it isn't my grandfather is diabetic.  So he said he'd be back in a half hour and it's been over an hour and I still haven't gotten my $3 2 liter of Diet Pepsi. The shop isn't that far from my house at all. The food is ok nothing tastes that great."}
{"text":"Now I'm not one to complain, but this was absurd. I ordered my food through grub hub at 6:47 and did not receive it till 8:35. I called grub hub 5 minutes prior seeing if it was a driver problem, but the driver got there right on time to pick it up. When I called the restaurant I spoke to a woman manager that was absolutely rude. I tried explaining to her the problem and she was very smart with me. She tried blaming grub hub, but our food was fresh out of the oven hot... hot sitting in a hot window for an hour hot. Eventually she went on to say \"well what do you want from me, free food? What?\" At this point I just hung up to eat with my family since our food FINALLY arrived. Pizza is okay, wing sauce tastes like it's just pure red hot, and not worth the nearly two hours I waited and $45 I spent."}
{"text":"My review is based off of the buffalo chicken pizza. It was my first time ordering from Pizza 412 so I didn't know what to expect. I ordered online, it arrived about 45 min later which wasn't too bad. That's about average for places I normally order from. When the pizza arrived, it was in good condition. It stayed together well. It was very good and I almost ate all of the large pizza by myself. I would definitely order from again....."}
{"text":"I got an order of their fries and they were absolutely terrible. They were oily, under cooked, and limp. So sad I wasted the money on them only to just throw them in the trash."}
{"text":"I was SO SAD to see DiCarlo's go - a longtime favorite of my family's, both at this location and in Wheeling, WV. At least I still have Wheeling for when I visit to take in the lights at Oglebay or a Nailers hockey game - and now, we also have the addition of a very good new pizza shop here in the 'Burgh with Pizza 412.  This location is such a convenient stop when en route home to the South Hills from work, so we ordered from them recently, hoping it would be a good spot. And it did not disappoint! Very good pizza. Crust neither too thin nor too doughy, good sauce, high-quality and generous cheese. They even threw in some ranch dressing for dipping without request and at no additional charge.  We will absolutely order from them again, and look forward to trying their other items like the hoagies (which the website mentions come on Mancini's bread). Glad to see a good-quality new pizza shop here. Recommended!"}
