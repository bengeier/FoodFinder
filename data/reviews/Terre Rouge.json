{"text":"We originally had a reservation booked here for last Friday for 8 people - 6 adults & 2 kids. They called me to confirm on Thursday afternoon and I informed them that we could no longer make it. I asked them if we could change the reservation to Saturday instead and the gentleman told me he needed to double check and put me on a short hold. A woman came back answering the phone and asked me what the issue was so I asked her if it was possible to change our reservation to Saturday evening instead. She told me that Saturday was fully booked and then asked me \"but how many people is it for?\" So I told her for 8 people - 6 adults & 2 kids. She rudely replied with attitude \"well I need to give seats to the kids too right so it doesn't make a difference....\"  No sh*t? LOL I was just informing the restaurant in advance so that maybe they could get two high chairs ready for the kids. Anyways, we didn't end up eating here on Saturday but after reading the reviews below I'm glad that we didn't. Seems like poor customer serivce is the norm here....."}
{"text":"Please DO NOT put this restaurant as French bistro. I confirmed with the chef that this is NOT a French bistro but a \"restaurant using French technique and Asian inspired\". This restaurant is at most a fusion restaurant and stop insulting French bistro.  We went during their soft opening and the food was a disaster. We ordered bone marrow as appetizer to share and steak fries as well as duck confit for main course.  Bone marrow: the dish is lukewarm with no seasoning. We couldn't finished it because it's still bloody inside. Perfect as Halloween decorations but not too impressive to swallow it.  Steak fries: my hubby asked for medium rare and it came as medium well because the sauce on top of the steak keeps cooking the meat. The sauce is sweet and it tasted exactly the same as duck confit which I found very turn off.   Duck confit: the duck confit is tender but it's way over cook. There is a coat of sauce cover the duck leg which made it tasted like Asian braised duck. Again, the sauce is too sweet or it's what the chef claimed as Asian inspired.  We didn't even bother asking for dessert menu because I couldn't take anymore disappointment at that time.   It was truly a highly anticipated restaurant in downtown Markham but it fell short. At the end of the day, a restaurant is to serve food. Looking nice on a plate only get you so far."}
{"text":"If I could give Terre Rouge 0 stars here, I would. TLDR: I would not recommend going here whatsoever.  One dish I was looking forward to was the baked brie - and it was a major disappointment. At $14 I expected a sizeable chunk of cheese for bread to dip into, but what we received was 5 slivers of bread and a SUPER THIN layer of cheese (literally probably only 1mm) in a mini pan, topped with a few berries. To make it worse, after each of us 4 diners ate a portion, with 1/5 portion remaining, the waiter abruptly begins to clear our plates and cutlery. We thought he was clearing away for our mains, but after he also snatched away our appetizer. Two of us loudly said we were not finished with it, but he was in a huge rush to turn and walk away from us that we were ignored. That was extremely offputting and rude but goes to say how small the portions were that 1/5 of the dish looked like scraps.   We wondered how we could politely complain or comment on this matter and decided to speak to the chef directly since he was out talking to the guests sitting beside us and looked like he would make his way around to everyone. However, the Chef (who quite happily so) only talked to this one table and no one else. Given it's a new restaurant and he gave so much attention to them, it was shocking and disappointing he gave no glance to anyone else. And whether intentional or not, it felt discriminatory because that one table who happened to get special customer service were the only Caucasian looking diners in the restaurant. And this was not just from the chef but also from the same waiter.   Other than that there was general unattentiveness from the wait staff where my friends had no opportunity to ask for salt or ketchup for their fries, it was somehow also not offered to begin with either. Waiters seemed quite unprofessional, host having no idea whether my friends arrived or not, waiter loudly saying to the host they had no idea where a specific table number was to take me to, attitude on being asked to split bills - just not the kind of service you expect at the upscale price they are positioning themselves to be.   Food was average, it was not specifically good or bad for its price point. But for that kind of service I would not be going again, and obviously will be telling everyone to avoid as well."}
{"text":"Five of us for dinner. Restaurant isn't licensed yet and we should have been told that when making the reservation.  Growing pains with food and service. And they charged $3 for sparking water which the waitress told us they make in-house. Without the license they should serve it for free. Dinner menu kind of all over the place.  French Italian fusion. Need to get more focused."}
{"text":"Just labeled this place as my Favourite French cursine in Markham. Chef Forrest is no ordinary cook, he is an artist in making food. I had a very satisfied dinner at his restruant. Highly recommmed to try his Tasting menu!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  I've came here twice and I absolutely adore this place. I've heard from friends that they've received mediocre service so I'm surprised at the reviews.   Food is amazing. I've ordered from both the regular menu and their tasting menu and enjoyed both times immensely.     Beef tartare - good sized portion for an appetizer. Good flavour.     Bone marrow - interesting switch up with an escargot addition. Not a lot of places serve it in Markham and I appreciate finding another one in Markham     Steak is meh. Honestly, everything else is better. Maybe I had to step up to the Wagyu.     Dessert - must order! I had their lava cake with hydrogen seasme ice cream. The lava cake was made with excellent chocolate and the sesame ice cream was an interesting change to reg ice cream. Had to crack it open to eat.     Tasting menu - a group of us girls came to try it out and this was what I enjoyed the most. The food is excellent for both taste and visual. Variety was excellent. They were able to accommodate any changes or adjustments with a small fee. And very filling!   I also like the service here contrary to others. They have character and I think it comes across as genuine and a little spunky. They also make really good drink recos. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited when I first heard about this restaurant. I was promptly seated and up until my appetizers arrived, the hospitality was alright. However, the food was severely lacking:  Oysters: The oysters that arrived were very good. Just as the server described (and with most west coast oysters) they had a very light, clean and sweet taste with a slight bit of saltiness. The pear sauce that came with it, however, did not compliment the oysters as it brought out a very bitter aftertaste and was too overwhelming for such a light tasting dish.  Tuna & Salmon: The dish came out nicely presented, however you either had the bland avocado and salmon or the overpowering tartare and the sauce that came with. The avocado wasn't seasoned with enough salt and the red onions in the mix weren't blanched for the slightest bit long enough causing slightly too sharp of a bite. The salmon I believe (from what I could taste) was basted/seasoned with sesame oil and one other ingredient and was okay. I believe the aim of the dish was to balance out the two strong flavours with two other milder flavours, however, instead of accomplishing that the flavours ended up clashing. The texture was very mushy and to compensate (as it is raw) they added little bits to add a bite and prevent it from being too monotonous to chew which was a good idea but almost ended up as uncomfortably hard to chew. It was to be paired with fried wonton chips and was overall alright.  Lobster Bisque: The dish was severely underwhelming to put it nicely. My first taste of the bisque was that of something murky and unpleasant as I assume they started with boiling lobster shells to incorporate flavour and instead came out with a very murky taste that had a hint(?) of lobster. With a larger spoonful, the next thing that stands out is the fact that it has a very powdery texture and they've incorporated a spice that's very prominent/common in curry spice mixes. (You can tell because it reminds you of curry however it's lacking because proper curry itself is made of a mixture of various freshly ground spices). This is a LOBSTER bisque. I should not be tasting murky water first, then an overpowering spice second. The first bite of the tiny lobster meat was spongey and honestly by that point I had trouble swallowing it. I felt so sick I didn't want to look at it any further and commented that I was finished with this dish. They kindly took it off the bill.   Bone Marrow & Escargot: The bone marrow was slightly bland which was okay but the escargot that came with was completely flavourless. The sourdough bread had a slight kick to it that was actually quite pleasant. It came with some salad that was flavoured with two things (balsamic and olive??) and truffle oil. I was recommended to combine all the items together, which was alright, I suppose.  However, what I was unpleased with was the fact that the general manager and I believe our host and server of the night was the assistant general manager(?), in full view of guests, argued/complains/etc I don't know what it is but as a guest I should never have to see any sort of unpleasant discussion/dispute (whether was about me or something else) in full, clear view."}
{"text":"Visited on Friday night for a casual holiday dinner with a group of 9. Always wanted to try this place, given I live in the new building right across from the resto and my bedroom overlooks this place!  It was a busy night for them, they sat us right in front of the main door albeit cold airs coming through the door which was disappointing. The first waiter also had a condescending attitude - none of us were a fan. Luckily, further into the night, a sweet lady took over to serve us and she was much more pleasant! She's worth the 18% grat. The GM and lady at the reception were both friendly, I could recognize them from the website.   The decor and ambience is spot on, love the vertical garden and def a place to be seen/instagrammed.  Most of us had the prix fix for 2 and thought it was a good deal. The oysters are fresh (though they did not have cocktail sauce when I asked, which is a quite surprising), the beet salad was good, all dishes have a thoughtful and welcoming presentation.  The truffle pizza was delicious - a thin crust combined with cheese and mushroom flavors - if you're into that, no doubt will be impressed.  The duck leg was fairly tender, had a nice Thai sweet sauce to it. The black cod was delicious - mine was cooked to the perfect texture and flavors. The green risotto on the side didn't actually go well with the cod... how about a regular risotto with fried shallots?  Yummy desserts esp. the lava cake! Personally a fan of black sesame ice cream so it's an obvious winner. Didn't like the nitrogen texture tho so that wasn't necessary.  Overall, ambience 5/5, service 3.5/5, food 4/5. Terre Rouge is an ambitious take from the team, and though it is working at the moment, there's a lot left to be improved. Definitely a great addition to the Downtown Markham scene."}
{"text":"1 Star because of their service! Food was decent but nothing spectacular given the price point and with the bad service to start off the night, it's hard to redeem yourself when food isn't top-notch.  Came here on Dec 1 (Friday night) as a group of 4 + a toddler and baby. My friend called to reserve a table a week early and specifically mentioned that there will be a toddler and baby joining. No one bothered informing us that they did not have high chairs.  I arrived early that night and was greeted by the hostess. I requested for a high chair and at that moment she replied \"We don't have any.Don't you have yours?\" Ok... so if I did have one I wouldn't ask...so I said no and that no one mentioned this to us when we made our reservations. She didn't bother apologizing or explaining, she just rolled her eyes at me and brought us to our table. I also loved how she seated us upstairs when a) I'm 9 months pregnant with a 2yr old toddler and b) another mom is coming in with a baby in car seat. And yes, we had to haul ourselves up those steep stairs.  Oh and don't expect them to have a kids menu either. This place is not baby or kid friendly at all. So don't come here if you have kids.  I feel that their service is not attentive enough as the waiter asked me to look over the wine/cocktail list while waiting for other guests to arrive. Umm...hello?!? I could barely squeeze in between your tables with my baby bump. Also when I request for a non alcoholic drink list he seemed very unwillingly to go downstairs to get it. The waiter also kept asking us if we were finish with the calamari and when we were down to the last one, he suggested someone to take the last piece so he can take away the plate. Seriously?!? For a second I thought I was eating at a Chinese restaurant!!!    Anyways, like other reviews have said, 3 out of the 4 of us ordered the cod and thought the cod was good but too sweet. I personally thought the risotto didn't match the cod at all, it was like eating two separate dish instead of one. Desserts and free WiFi were probably the highlight of the night. conclusion: with the high price, mediocre food and poor service, I would not come back here again nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely terrible here. The waiter completely forgot about us and tables that came in after we ordered got food before us.   I had the duck, and it was smaller than a normal quarter leg size, so don't expect to be full. My gf ordered the steak frites, and it came 15 minutes after mine....like seriously? My food was cold by the time her steak came.   Overall, avoid this place. Service and food are both terrible for the price they charge."}
{"text":"First, and likely last time we'll be dining here.  Too bad because not too many fine/trendy dining options in Markham.  For the prices they charge, you would expect a much more refined experience.    Simply put, the place is poorly managed.  3 hours for a meal, forgetting one of the entrees, waiter as opposed to bartender making our cocktails, and lack of attention to details are all telltale signs of an inexperienced manager.  As for the food, average at best.    The only reason why I didn't score 1 star was because they at least acknowledged their poor service without me having to point it out.  They also gave us a complimentary dessert (but again showed their lack of experience because it included peanuts).    I sincerely wish them the best, so hopefully ownership can take some honest and candid criticism, and right this ship before it's too late."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend (5 total) for dinner on Saturday night. We reserved in advance so we got our table fairly quickly.   When we got our table, we were deciding where to sit as some of us did not know each other too well so we wanted to make it as comfortable as possible. The hostess basically just told us to sit down in a loud and satirical manner, which I thought was quite rude. I think as guests, we can take our time to decide where to sit as we weren't bothering nor affecting anyone around us. Thankfully, our waitress on the other hand was very nice and accommodating.   For the appetizers, we ordered the foie gras mousse, bone marrow, calamari, beef tartare and truffle fries. I would pass on the foie geas and bone marrow..both were lacking in flavour. The beef tartare was probably the best app - full of flavour and zest. The calamari was alright.   For the main, I had the black cod which was good. It was tender and the inside was moist. The green pea risotto was ok - just a tad sweet in my opinion. Others had the steak and frites. One person at our table ordered it medium rare but it literally came out well-done so we told them. They did switch it for us very quickly and the second steak came out alot better.   For the dessert, we shared the deconstructed cheesecake and chocolate molten lava cake. I really enjoyed the sesame nitrogen ice cream that came with the lava cake although I felt it was a bit of a disconnect from the rest of the plate as we were already given vanilla ice-cream with the cake. The deconstructed cheesecake was decent but it was literally just maybe 2-3 spoonfuls of it so from a price point perspective, I would expect a bit more for something that is $12.   Overall, this place was ok but I probably would not return in the near future. Given the price point and quality/service, there are better options out there to choose from."}
{"text":"Attention to detail seems to be the watchword of the day at Terre Rouge. I was very impressed by the ambiance of the restaurant, upscale and cozy. I love the open kitchen and the service and kitchen staff were obviously very invested in the experience they created. As far as bistro experiences go I was impressed on all fronts.     Service was prompt and considerate, nothing was 'pushed' on our table and the flow of one course to the next was well handled.     The food was excellent, I got to have their escargot, scallop carpaccio, pizza, foie gras poutine, salmon, and vanilla icecream. There was a great variety of options available for any taste however portion sizes from one dish to the next (of equal value) were not entirely consistent.       Overall if you are a fan of the French bistro experience and want a solid offering I would highly suggest Terre Rouge. Professional, unpretentious, and refreshing."}
{"text":"Finally got good French place in Markham! I ordered the Lobster and Mussel, fresh and tasty. love the Lava cake! It's definitely something different. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Date: Dec 2017  Went at lunch with a friend and got to try the prix fix meal for $22 (only get to select 2 out of 3 courses).   Duck confit: the duck confit is tender but it's way over cook. There is a coat of sauce cover the duck leg which made it tasted like braised duck. The sauce was too much on the duck skin and caused the outer layer to be rough/tough. The fries were on the cliff of burnt and super crispy. You can smell the aroma of the burntness.   Panna Cotta was very plain and simple.  Atmosphere was nice but for this price point, I was expecting more quality food. There are definitely better restaurants options available in the Markham/Richmond Hill.   For a restaurant that is charging a tasting menu with a premium cost, they cannot even get the basics right.... scary...  UPDATE: They got no backbone since they blocked me on IG."}
{"text":"Terre Rouge: while I did enjoy my dining experience tonight, I am disappointed to realize that an element of my dish was clearly missing. Comparing the photos on Yelp to my own, and reading your online menu now, can you address why my duck confit was missing the beer foam??  Place: nice ambience and view from the window seat overlooking the skating rink and carousel.  Location: within downtown markham but not that convenient or obvious to get to due to no left turn and no u turn signs on the street leading to the restaurant.  Parking is behind the restaurant where the Remington parking lot is.   Food: good, but disappointed to find out my $27 dish was missing a critical element!  For dessert I would recommend the molten lava cake with black sesame nitrogen ice cream. Calamari, bone marrow, and scallop aps were all good.  Price: on the pricey side compared to other markham restaurants, but would be a nice spot for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to dine at a restaurant close to home (hoping finally there's a great place I don't need to travel downtown for) but unfortunately it was a big letdown. I was craving for steak and instead of going to the keg, I thought I'd have a better experience here. The steak was dry and tough, it was worse than the $10 steak you get from Walmart! The only saving grace is a small piece of foie gras we ordered. It was so buttery, it practically melted in your mouth. To be fair, I scanned the room and checked out what other patrons ordered, the rack of lamb looked great and looked like a big portion - it seemed like they enjoyed their food. As for me, I doubt I'd be returning."}
{"text":"Came again for dinner this time. Got calamari and this time there isn't any batter that has no calamari so it is better than last time. However the food for me is still pretty overpriced than what the quality I get. Got their special of the day for appetizer, which is uni on fresh scallops. The scallops seem fresh and so is uni but the sauce overpower the taste of those 2 seafood and all I taste is some type of butter and egg. For main course is steak and I had it in medium rare, but the meat is a bit tough and don't have any steak flavors. Overall, I think their lunch menu is better than dinner and they do have good service, just the food is not what I would pay for this price; at least for the steak or maybe I just had a bad cut."}
{"text":"Best upscale, farm to table cuisine in Markham. Truffle pizza, marrow escargots and lava cake. If you're a foodie, a must try!! Fair prices and good portion sizes. Price fixe menu and tasting menus so you can try it all. Ambiance is perfect so you will never feel under or over dressed. Service is great, never an empty water glass."}
{"text":"A few of us had been talking about trying this restaurant since it first opened. Disappointed to say that it wasn't what we expected!  We were greeted at the door and escorted upstairs. Restaurant was packed on a weekday, which for them, I suppose is a good thing. Not sure if it was what we ordered that was a mistake but all 4 of us were disappointed! Two of us ordered the salmon which was served on a bed of chickpeas, soya beans and cabbage. The salmon was fine however the beans sat in a broth which was VERY lemony and tart which was not very pleasing to the palette. Another ordered the chicken which was just ok...nothing mind blowing. But the worst was the $28 signature plate which was the steak frite which was dry and tough! Fries were fine but then how can you mess those up?  When we asked the maître d' what the cut of meat was he said Pave, which sounded like it should be some expensive cut of meat but in essence, when I looked it up it's basically rump steak!  The toughest and cheapest cut of meat you can buy!  They had no issue taking it back and she re-ordered the cod which was pretty good.   On a good note, we had the charcuterie platter to start, which was quite tasty, however, they gave us 2 of the tiniest pickles which were half the size of my pinky. Would it have killed their budget to throw in a couple more?  After returning the food, the waiter only came back once to give us bill and the maître d' didn't even bother to apologize for the meal.   Would we return or refer this to someone else?  Absolutely not!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!!!  They charged high end price but the execution and delivery is so poor that the price for the dish is not justified . I don't mind paying extra for good food , but this is not delivering the expected results.  Service is poor and not friendly  Food is so poor .. pastry for the escargot is as hard as a rock !! Chicken is not really exceptional , not much taste to it and lack of sauce, I can cook this dish at home better than this . Duck sauce is too sweet and the beer foam is not doing anything for the dish .  Calamari ... oh my goodness... worst ever.  Sorry but our experience with this restaurant is not good , not very professional to my standard and with the price they charged ."}
{"text":"Ohhh boy, where do we even begin? I rarely give 1 star reviews. But honestly, the service was terrible for such a fancy restaurant. I really wanted to like this place. Especially because a friend recommended it, and she organized this whole fine-dining experience for our friend who just turned 30.  My husband and I were among the first guests to arrive. We had a party of 18 and our friends were slowly trickling in. Within 5 minutes of being seated, the waiter comes to our table and asks us to place our order. There were only 4 of us at this point. I informed him that most of our party hasn't arrived yet so we would rather wait. He seemed quite pushy so we ended up putting in our order. He then asked us how we were going to pay. I thought that was strange as we literally just sat down. But I said it would be most likely that all would pay by card separately. He seemed very displeased and said that that's not possible as it would take forever. I told him that most of our friends probably didn't bring cash for a fine-dining dinner. He argued saying that it would take 45 mins to settle all the bills if we were to pay separately. As I was about to repeat the fact that people probably didn't bring enough cash, he said that he'd have his manager talk to me. I've never been to a restaurant where it would take that long to process payment for a party under 20 guests, let alone a fine dining restaurant. I really can't see why this is a problem. But anyway... At terre rouge, you choose from a few menu set options at fixed price points. Our party got the $65 menu which included calamari and salmon tartare to start, black cod, pizza or steak frites for entrée, and a dessert trio to end things off. At $65 per person, you would think that each person would get their own appetizer, entrée and dessert. We thought wrong! The appetizer AND dessert were made to share between four people. Not to mention the salmon tartare was the size of a small tuna can - the kinds you'd get for your cat.  I really hoped that things would get better after ordering, but unfortunately it just went downhill from there. My friend ordered the black cod, and after a few bites, she found a piece of aluminum foil in her food. We learned later that 2 other people from our party had aluminum foil in their food as well.  For a $65 dinner plus 18% gratuity... I would say this was definitely not worth it. But hey, if you've got $65 to blow for a dinner garnished with aluminum foil, all power to ya!  All in all, I think my friend put it quite nicely: \"This experience was quite unique... Unique cause it will only happen once.\""}
{"text":"Came here last week to celebrate a birthday.   Just a heads up that if you bring a cake, they charge a cake cutting fee of $3 PER person.    The decor was very nice and modern. The first floor is definitely a lot nicer and brighter.  Upstairs was dark and had orange lighting which is not optimal for picture taking.  Food was expensive and portions were extremely small.  We had the calamari, beef tartare and charcuterie board to start.  The only dish I would recommend is the beef tartare.  My friend and I shared the burger and duck.  It was nice that they cut the burger in half and put them on separate plates for us so it was easier to eat.  Burger was tasty and juicy and fries were okay.  The duck was dry and was a bit bland. Overall, for the price, I expected better quality and larger portions.  Service also wasn't so great.  Our server tried to take our appetizers away when we weren't even finished and we had to ask him several times before he refilled our waters.  Probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This a really great place for weekend nights or some special occasions.  Great food, nice service, modern atmosphere, reasonable prices.  I have been there several times in the past 2 months. I have to say that, this is the best restaurant for western food near Markham area, and also the only place with the open kitchen concept. The dining atmosphere is really comfortable. But if you are looking for somewhere with more privacy, you could go upstairs. The second floor was decorated with orange lights, reddish brown rocks, and it is quite and darker than the first floor.  I almost tried all the items on the menu, and I really like its tasting menu idea. For the first-time customers, the tasting menu is a great choice that you can try most of the items on the menu with an adjusted portion. Salmon with Seared Foie Gras was my favorite dish before tonight. The salmon skin is so crispy, while the flesh is very tender. The seared foie gras served with crunchy baguette tastes so delicious. You could feel the protein and fat melt in your tongue. However, the healthy salmon reduces the guilty that the foie gras brought.  This evening, the manager Heuy(?) recommended the lobster soup and the wagyu steak, which are seasonal special right now. I noticed that there was some spice in the soup, but I didn't feel so spicy. The lobster was fresh and sweet. I hope that the bread cubes could be placed on the side, so I could still enjoy their crunchiness. At first, I didn't have a high expectation of wagyu in a western restaurant, because I prefer Japanese style more. But the wagyu steak tasted wonderful that I wished it could be a regular item. Although the ribeye is tasty as well, the wagyu steak tasted different and more delicious. And this dish becomes my new favorite.  I always order a mascarpone cheesecake for dessert. It's creamy and thick. It usually brings the happy ending of my dinner.   The servers are nice, and they always patiently explain the menu and specials to me. I will recommend this place to my friends, and come back again.  The parking lot of this restaurant is small. But it is ok for me, because there are several other parking spaces nearby."}
{"text":"It's a pretty nice spot for a fancy dinner in downtown Markham.  Comfortable dining space.  Appetizers were share plates.  Had deep fried calemari and a tuna tartare.  Both were pretty good.  Steak frites unfortunately was not the best cut of meat in my opinion.  BUT, it was cooked exceptionally well.  Black cod was phenomenal.  Probably the best thing I had that night.  The risotto with it as also delicious.  Dessert was also a share plate.  Not a fan of a shared dessert style personally but I guess it gives you more choices to try.  Overall I have to say the chef did a pretty good job here.  Maybe priced just a tad higher than what I thought it should be.    I would come again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy my dinner here. The food is very good. You can see that the chef has put alot of effort into adding new elements to each dish. We had the bone marrow with escargot in it. The fro gras poutine, black cod and various dessert. Nitrogen sesame seed ice cream, molten lava cake and the vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon with chickpeas. Too much sauce and it was way too salty that it was probably meant to be served with rice. The salmon was something you could probably make at home.. nothing special. I liked the decor tho."}
{"text":"Mains were pretty good. Appetizers weren't that good except for the beef tartare. Nice cozy spot to check out"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this restaurant and we only tried the tasting menu for $88 for two. I gotta say,  the food wait time is bad, so this would be a 3 stars review from me but because of the food quality and pricing, I give it a 4 this time.  Food - 4 stars The tasting menu has 5 courses: Raw Oyster - it's very fresh and served cold and it doesn't has the unpleasant \"fishy\" smell which I am quite sensitive to . I like this dish. Salads - I personally like the Caesar salad better (especially the bacon, lol) than the beet  and carrot salads Pizza- it's quite nice and served fresh from the oven with a very nice cheese and truffle flavour Duck confit- is a bit on the dry side but still acceptable. The beer foam probably helped abit to balance out on the sweetness of the duck. I think if the foam is somehow incorporated part of the sauce on the duck, probably better.   Cod- very nicely cooked and soft. But the risotto is abit bland, maybe for the reason in not trying to over power the cod taste.. but as it stands, something is missing with this combination of the cod and the risotto, IMO. :) Dessert- we tried both the lava cake and the disassembled cheese cake. The plating for both are pretty. The lava cake is excellent, soft and warm from the inside and rich with chocolate flavours. I would prefer this over the cheese cake if I have to pick between the two.  I think folks should try the tasting menu as I think it's good to try different dishes at the same time.  Service- ok- The waiter is trying hard to serve us but I guess maybe it's too many customer that night, he doesn't have much time for us until after I complain about the main course wait time ... but it's forgiving since we don't need much attention.  The food wait time: -1 star at least. Not sure what's going on, but the wait time is horrible. Especially when waiting for the main course. I guess what upset me the most is after some long wait, the 3 guests from the table who sat diagonals to us ( window table in front of the curtains by the open kitchen) who arrive at least 30 minutes later than us but got their main dishes first before my table... even when they are finished with the main course, ours still hasn't arrive. That's when I decided to ask the waiter on the status of my food and the response is kitchen are behind. I am not sure how their queueing/priority system works but definitely something is wrong.  Tasting menu price- +1 star - $88 for two, I thinks it's pretty good pricing   I don't think the menu item choices would make big differences on the overall food wait time, meaning I were to order regular menu items with regular price, I would leaning toward a 3 stars review but I did have the tasting menu- a 4 stars this time.   Hopefully they will improve the wait time and I am sure I would enjoy this much more. :)"}
{"text":"So, I'm not sure about the whole \"french Bistro\" because this place doesn't strick me as a french restaurant. Although I read somewhere they were going for the Asian inspire/french restaurant. Ok, so the food. I love the food! I came here for lunch with my husband and the service was fantastic, the place wasn't packed, but we came here during the first week of opening. He ordered the burger and I ordered the sandwich and truffle fries. Everything was delicious!!!   I loveeeee the truffle fries it was sooooooo good. The taste of the truffle was heaven! My husband had the burger, it was good, it was super juicy and I had the sandwich with avocado.. yum! It also came with a side salad.   It is on the pricier side, but not too bad since I did really enjoy the food. The decor was really pretty too!   Overall, I would come back and try out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Have you ever been screamed at angrily in front of an entire floor of guests by a high end restaurant owner/manager? If you would like such an experience, ask for Karan Tsoi of Terre Rouge! Read on for full details.  Been here twice now - first time for our 7 year anniversary and second time for Father's Day. Our first experience was decent. We got the beef tartare, black cod, and mushroom risotto. The service was poor - the waiter didn't even ask if we wanted dessert and just slammed the menus on our tables. He didn't smile once during our whole night. Despite this, I would have given them a 3 star because the food was great.  Today we came for Father's Day dinner with a reservation. You can tell they were having a hard time keeping up with the orders because they weren't used to being at capacity. I ordered the same dish, the cod, and it was definitely not as good as the first time i had it.   Here comes the worst part that warrants the one star. My father in law had ordered a trio of sorbet, but it came completely melted. We pointed this out, and her response was that it's humid, they scooped it first and had to wait for all the other desserts to finish before bringing it out. Um, does anyone else agree that for a restaurant at this price point, they should know to scoop the sorbet out last? It's totally fine, but she was so defensive and was very reluctant to give us a new one. This is still not the worst part. she saw me starting to write a yelp a review and decided to YELL AT ME, ASSUMING ILL WRITE A BAD REVIEW AND SCREAMED AT ME SAYING HOW INCONSIDERATE IT WAS OF ME SINCE IT WAS SO HOT OUTSIDE TODAY AND THAT I WAS DESTROYING HER RESTAURANT. And if you can believe this - SHE CLAIMED TO BE THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT. I wish I could have recorded her yelling at us. I was so shocked at her lack of professionalism and how such a person could run a restaurant. I really feel bad for the employees that have to work under her management."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely chic and polished.   I have nothing bad to say about the food. I dined here twice and tried many of their items. Overall, I thought they were cooked and executed well.   The price is fair. It is not cheap but I don't think I over paid. I mean, $30 for a cod dish is very reasonable nowadays.  For the service, I can't even say it was bad either. It was professional and attentive.   So why is this only 3 stars?   I feel while it delivered  on quality of food, it failed to deliver an EXPERIENCE.   The people working there didn't seem very happy to be there or excited about the dishes they are offering. and effectively that didn't make me feel very happy and excited either.   This is an up scale French restaurant, not a Milestone. Give us some warmth and personality! CONNECT us with the food we are eating"}
{"text":"So came here for my birthday lunch. Service was not attentive at all. Did not asked how my food was. Rude attitude! I asked my waiter if it's a different chef at night or afternoon, he said the cod at night is a risotto one. That's not the point. The quality went down. It's different. Bad attitude and I don't feel welcomed. The wagyu tasted worse than cayon creek and keg. I am not asking for Blueblood steakhouse quality. Not coming back myself. Totally not an enjoyable experience and not recommending this venue to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Probable the best restaurant in Toronto. Very family friendly and they make you feel like you are part of their family. Service is great and highly recommend the 18oz Aged Ribeye and Canadian AAA beef burger. I will be back?"}
{"text":"So I finally gotten to try this place. Came here with my foodie friend for dinner to celebrate the holiday. Anyhow, let's get down to business. I reserved the table using OpenTable, so this was smooth and I gotten my confirmation email yesterday. Came here 5 mins early, walked into the restaurant and the maitre d' said our table was ready. That's not bad imo. When I walked into the restaurant had a nice and modern feel to it. They got a nice clean feel to it. I like that.  Onto the food. So I was glancing over their menu, not bad choices. Then our server came by and told me about the Wagyu Beef. I was very tempted to order that. However I settled for the steak frites. Foodie friend wanted salmon and we shared the truffle mushroom pizza. The pizza came first and we started chowing down. Initially I couldn't taste the truffle as the cheese overwhelmed it. However, wait till the end of the bite near the crust is where the wonderful flavour of truffle. \"Save the best for last?\" Then I had my steak frites. Steak came out perfectly cooked and seasoned. Only thing I wish for was they didn't let the steak sit too long. My friend was okay with the salmon dish. Then we ordered the molten lava cake and that wasn't bad. I mean the cake wasn't bad. It's... alright?  Overall experience... 3.75/5? For one, the patrons gotten a bit too loud. So not the restaurant's fault. The other was the steak, they let it sit just a bit longer than my liking. The restaurant is new, so they are working on it to improve. Not a 4/5 yet, but they are near."}
{"text":"Taste is good. Portion is not big but Mussels are good for sharing! I tried the bone marrow escargot, it's favourable but not easy to eat it with perfect manner. For the service, it always have room to improve, as one of the server keep asking/comments \"can you finish all the food?\", should I order less food next time?"}
{"text":"We were a group of three and are at Terre Rouge last night.  The food, the service and the atmosphere was exceptional.  We're local to the area and will most definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"We came to Terre Rouge for a family dinner at 6 pm and were disappointed to find out that they had already sold out of the beef wellington. I can understand certain entrees not being available towards the end of dinner service, but if you haven't done enough prep to meet the needs of the first round of diners, then that's a problem. I haven't seen any pics of the Wellington so if it's not available, take it off the menu rather than lie and say it's sold out.   As we sat down, we noticed all our plates were dirty, and cutlery had fingerprints all over them. Even the replacement dishes we asked for were dirty and had to ask again to get them replaced.  We noticed other tables had bread, but our server never bothered to bring us any, so we had to specifically ask for some. The bread was so stale and dry, I would rather not have had any. For a French-style restaurant, this bread was one of the worst I've had. So not a great start to our dining experience...   We ended up ordering: - Carrots and Beets salad ($13) - the sweetness and crunch of the candied quinoa goes well with the rest of the dish. This was quite refreshing and a good starter.   - Calamari ($13) - the batter is too thick making the Calamari a little too doughy and not crisp. The tzatziki was also a little too dense. Had better Calamari elsewhere.   - Duck Confit ($25) - the duck itself was very tender and tasty, but the portion was a tad small and the sauce a little too sweet. The mashed potato and corn reminds me of the old hungry-man microwave TV dinners I used to eat as a child. Not very sophisticated and perhaps that's why they added the beer foam to try and elevate the dish. Sadly the beer foam just doesn't work. The beer flavor doesn't compliment the duck in any way, and within a few mins the foam deflates, and you are left with a puddle of beer on your plate. Not impressed.   - Black Cod ($32) - the black cod was very tasty and done well. The spinach risotto was also quite good. The portion is too small for the price though.   - 18 oz Ribeye ($49) - the steak here is a decent cut of ribeye, but nothing extraordinary (say Costco quality). Of course, you can't compare this place to a high-end specialty steakhouse like Jacobs. But let's compare to another French restaurant like Bacchanal with a similar price point. They have a 38 oz 60 day aged bone-in ribeye for $57 (if you subtract out the cost of the three sides it gets bundled with). So for a similar price, you get more meat and far superior quality of meat with better texture and flavour. So paying $49 for an 18 oz Costco-grade ribeye is overpriced in my opinion.   - Molten Lava Cake ($12) - the molten lava cake itself was quite good. But the liquid nitrogen black sesame ice cream is a total gimmick. Very lumpy and not well prepared. I've had better black sesame ice cream as a complimentary dessert at many Japanese restaurants. For better liquid nitrogen ice cream, go to Cool N2.   Overall, the food quality isn't up to par with other French restaurants at a similar price point (for example Bacchanal is better in every way except for the commute downtown). They try to impress with gimmicks like the beer foam and liquid nitrogen ice cream rather than focus on developing better flavor and food preparation techniques. The atmosphere is really nice, and I like the open concept kitchen. The service is a little slow, but decent. I wasn't too impressed that the head executive chef was busy chatting up all his buddies and delivering food only to them while the expeditor was busy doing all the real work. Rather than coordinating with the rest of the culinary team as a head chef should be doing, he was doing remedial tasks like putting leftover food in takeout boxes. Interesting...  Currently, there isn't much competition in the up-town area for French-style cuisine, so I suppose they can get away with running their restaurant the way they are now. But for the price they are charging, I would much rather make the trek downtown to experience much better quality French cuisine. They just opened, so hopefully, they can improve the menu and quality of the food to justify the price they are charging."}
{"text":"I was eager to try Terre Rouge, a beautiful cozy restaurant adjacent to the Pride of Canada carousel in the Downtown Markham area. I was able to get a same day (same hour) reservation via Open Table. Upon walking in I was impressed by the green feature wall. There are stairs leading to the second floor which has a bar. There is enough space upstairs to perhaps hold a private function or larger groups, with a terrace overlooking the carousel and what will eventually be the Marriott hotel.  We were seated at a window-side table for two with a calming view of the carousel. There were a few larger groups, but the main floor area seems best suited for groups of 8 people or less. I like that this restaurant offers a tasting menu option, something not offered readily in Markham. Tasting menu is $85 for 7 courses. We opted to select the pizza,  steak frites, and the salmon from the a la carte menu.   We were served bread to start with a small amount of whipped butter. The pizza arrived first. It was presented nicely on a wooden pizza board. Unfortunately it was a miss for me as it was served cold, looked fairly unappealing, and taste-wise was underwhelming. I enjoy mushrooms a lot but I felt that I would have preferred to enjoy them in whole pieces where they would have added textural component to the pizza. Rather, the mushrooms were puréed into an unattractive brown sauce that sat on my pizza and under the cheese with a random frisée salad on top.   Our steak frites and salmon dishes came together. The salmon had a nice crispy skin but was a tad underdone for my hubby's taste. It was served atop a bed of sautéed chickpeas and edamame beans. The steak was tender and cooked medium rare as I had requested. Unfortunately the grill marks were excessively charred, and thus each bite of steak tasted burnt. It was virtually inedible without cutting off the burnt areas of the steak. The fries were at least tasty, well seasoned, and crisp.   The service staff were quite attentive generally and to our concerns. It was nice of the restaurant to not charge us for the steak, and they seemed receptive to feedback. The food is a bit pricey.   We found parking in the lot on the north side of the carousel, or after hours, I imagine it one could park at the Remington presentation centre, west of the restaurant.   I really wanted to like Terre Rouge because I was excited about the prospect of a Downtown Markham restaurant that offers a tasting menu. Unfortunately I was fairly underwhelmed by this initial experience. Recognizing they are still in their soft opening phase (they are awaiting their liquor license), I would probably return again to see if food consistency improves after opening week kinks are ironed out."}
{"text":"Had such an amazing experience at this restaurant last night!  I had the calamari to start and I have to say the way they do it was amazing, the batter was not your traditional crunchy batter, it had crunch but also a softness to it that was perfect. For entree I had the wagyu steak and it was out of this world, melted in my mouth. I highly recommend the lava cake, it was like nothing I've ever had before. Very talented chefs here, finally something really high end and modern in Markham, will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Expected to be a classy new opened French restaurant, but walked out disappointed. We reserved few days in advance and got our table at the main floor. Not much space and we feel squeezed. We are literally only 2 feet away from the next table. No difference than sitting in a fast food restaurant. Lobster is tiny, probably only half of the lobster tail for a $33 dishes with a dozen of regular myssel together. My wife ordered the Duck confit, duck tasted great with the sauce. Marrow Bone & Escargot is probably the most special one I had. The foie gras Mousse is overrated, $15 for the mousse that taste like foie Gras...  Tasting menu was offered at $85 pp. Good that I did not order it. Most likely will not come back ."}
{"text":"Can't say much yet. They don't have a liquor license. They do have great staff. Menu needs work but what I did have was great."}
{"text":"Bone marrow & escargot dish was not hot/warm when it arrived; it was rather cold which was disappointing. Also, the steak was not cooked as requested. Three people got different requests: medium, medium rare and rare. The rare and medium were overcooked while the medium rare was undercooked. The size of the cuts were inconsistent. Also, the amount of fries on one's steak frites was significantly more than another at our table.   Automatic gratuity of 18% for large group (we had 7 but they counted us as 8)."}
{"text":"If you are coming here for food,  it's definitely not where you want to be.  However the service and scenery is great,  other then that, don't even bother.   Prices are on bar with downtown restaraunt but not even half as good.  Had the burger which was basically an imitation of a McDonald's Big Mac with Cole slaw in it....  The black cod was okay but the small size of it and the price tag was definitely dissapointing.  Goto ja bistro instead,  half the price bigger portion and tastier.    The pizza was okay,  was sort of like a McCain's microwaveable but with better cheese.   I wonder how long this will stay open for,  food is so bad and the renovations must of cost a Sigificant amount...."}
{"text":"Food was really tasty and flavorful but not worth the price point in my opinion. Portion sizes were small but that was somewhat expected. Service wasn't greatest - we waited for a long time to place our order and when longer to get our food. Having said that it was Fathers Day, so understandable! Anyway, dad enjoyed it (which I guess is all that matters today) but not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I pass by this place almost everyday but didn't get a chance to check it out...until Tues evening....there is sufficient parking behind the restaurant...   Upon arriving, I liked the chic design throughout, the washrooms were on the second floor, not sure if it is  for all for the 2 sets of stairs...  Our coats were taken and we were seated, the open kitchen idea is great, I always give kudos to places who dares to have open kitchen meaning the visible aspect of it must be clean as so many eyes are watching...   The menu was small but detailed, my friend ordered the duck while I ordered the chicken. We shared the scallops as a starter.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, wasn't over or under cooked. The service manager was nice and knew his stuff which is plus 1* because too many people  don't know whenever you enter a restaurant. I've asked numerous times at restaurants and most people can't tell me too much about the dish...  CSM also recommend to Chardonnay and it was pretty good! Our food arrived, service was good...they were attentive...in filling our waters and asking at all the right times...   All in all, will be back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"The portions are very tiny. We left feeling hungry. Dinner for two we Had two mains - black cod with risotto ($35) ( this was like an appetizer, tiny) and lobster with mussels ($30). Also had oysters and scallops (2 for $9) as appetizers. We will not return. Ambience was nice and service was quick but because the portions were tiny and it was very overpriced we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great service! Thanks to the server who made our bday night special. I'd call this French with Asian flare. I'm not typically into fusion but this was subtle. Great tasting menu value!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came to Terre Rouge for dinner. The interior is very nice and modern. We liked the open kitchen concept - mainly because you get to see the chefs at work and whether or not they keep the place clean! Service from the host was great, he was very friendly and amiable - the host brought us to our seats and checked in on us in good intervals. The service from our server, not so much. Our server wasn't very friendly.  * BONE MARROW AND ESCARGOT (2.5/5) (with Garlic Parsley Crumble) My friend who came here for their bone marrow told me not to order this because he mentioned there was not enough taste, but I wanted to try it anyways. I agree with my friend, there wasn't enough flavour! I understand if they're trying to make this dish more 'natural tasting' but unfortunately, I didn't think there was enough taste on both the bone marrow and escargot.  * COD RISOTTO (3/5) 3 points goes to the Cod fish! Loved the fish, it was deliciously marinated. The 2 points were deducted because of the risotto. It was so salty. It was suggested to consume both the cod fish and the risotto at the same time (in one bite), but I still think the risotto was way too salty.  * STEAK FRITES (3.5/5) (Herb Butter, Shallot Jam, Oxtail) This was yummy! I liked what I chose a lot! The steak was cooked to medium-rare, just how I've requested and the fries were also delish. I think the sauce was mayo, and I LOVE mayo! Best pairing ever."}
{"text":"WOW.....fine dining that's so close to home.  Who needs to go downtown for good eats when you can park for free, get attentive service and scrumptious food.  Seriously... everything we ordered was well executed.  The miso cod over a bed of creamy spinach risotto being the highlight of the night.  Chef Forrest was very personable and made sure everything was good.  He's so young and so talented.  I can't wait to see what new and exciting dishes he comes up with.  I look forward to my next visit soon!"}
{"text":"Recently had the pleasure of trying this place out. The staff was very polite and welcoming. The restaurant itself looked great with an open concept kitchen. The dining area provides a nice view of downtown Markham. I was able to try the tasting menu where we were able to try different courses. The host and servers were very knowledgeable of each dish and asked us how the food was.  One thing to keep in mind is that this is a French inspired bistro where some of their meals may have a fusion twist to them.    From the tasting menu one of my favorite dishes was the glazed black cod with spinach risotto. The fish was incredibly tender and had a bit of sweetness to it. The Risotto was combined with spinach and topped with bonito flakes which I thought was an interesting take on risotto. I felt like the fish went really well with the risotto and I highly recommend the glazed black cod if it's your first time at this restaurant. Overall this was the only dish that really stood out to me. I felt like the flavors of the other dishes did not really appeal to me as much and that there was a bit too much sweetness throughout the main courses.    Overall since the restaurant is still relatively new I would be interested to see what kind of changes or improvements that they'll make in the future."}
{"text":"Was here for Xmas party which was a set menu.  The main courses were the steak frite, the pizza, and the cod.    I did not try the pizza but both the steak and cod were made with a sweet sauce, which I didn't like.  The cocktail menu was extensive, but the Cane Flower tasted like cough medicine.  The servers were not attentive enough and forgot some requests made by people on the table.  The ambience was refreshing, but if the food and the serving could be improved, this could be a success."}
{"text":"The space is nice. Upstairs is dim & intimate.   The food was ok.  I had the black cod ($32) - tastes like what you get at teppanyaki, a bit too sweet for my liking. The risotto was a bit bland, but I could taste the spinach.   Up to this point, everything would be ok, but 2 things really shocked me:  1. Baked Brie was $14 down the drain. Expected a block of brie - nope. Maybe they just sliced a thin layer? - nope. It was like eating melted bits of cheese stuck to the bottom of the pan. It was a sad struggle to scrape the remnants to eat with my tiny toast. Very shocking to see a baked brie made this way; insignificant portion for this price.  2. Service - i) the server took away the unfinished brie dish even after 2 of my friends said (quite loudly) that we were not finished. Very strange. ii) most new establishments/upscale dining (if this is what it's positioned as) would have the servers/owners check on the customers to ask about the meal. Again, quite odd this didn't happen, or maybe I was expecting too much?"}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (4 stars) Not a lot of parking and the entrance was difficult to see clearly. We drove past it the first time around. The two story restaurant is new and modern, elegantly decorated and clean. When we arrived for our reservation, our table was still being prepared so we were seated at the bar with water while we waited. The restaurant was not very busy when we arrived on Friday night around 8:30pm, probably 4-5 tables seated. The second floor was not open.      SERVICE (4 stars) Courteous and attentive, if a little overbearing, service. The front of house manager seated us at the bar and notified us of the wait for our table. Not long after, another waiter came by to let us know they were still clearing the table. I did appreciate the coat check service (we were given number tokens to pick up our coats after). The waiter took our orders correctly but could benefit from a little more study of menu offerings. There were some specials and upgrades we inquired about but he was unable to give us a definitive answer without checking. (i.e.Q: How much is it to upgrade to truffle frites? A: $3) He was more than happy to split the bill for our group of 11 which we were grateful for.   FOOD (3 stars) We ordered a charcuterie board and beef tartare to start. Both items were well presented and delicious. I like that some of the ingredients were sourced locally in Ontario. For mains, I ordered the steak frites and upgraded to truffle frites. My boyfriend ordered the chicken. The steak portioning is smaller than expected and tough but cooked to the requested medium rare. Truffle frites were delicious. The chicken was cooked well but was missing a certain restaurant quality. I note that not everyone got the same amount of fries, some significantly less. My friend commented that the lamb chops were really good. I ordered their dessert to end the meal - a mixed berry pavlova - which I really enjoyed. Plating was beautiful.   QUALITY/VALUE (3) At $28 for maybe four ounces of steak, I think Terre Rouge has priced their menu too high for the quality and quantity of food. Dessert items at $12 - $14 apiece is also higher than similar restaurants in the area. Beers come at $9-10 a pint and cocktails start at $13, which is reasonable. The bill came to $115 for two people after 18% gratuity as we were in a large group.  OVERALL 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great addition to downtown Markham as I love French bistro myself.  The chef/owner has worked in many well known restaurants around the world and created an interesting French inspired menu.  I attended on a private night with a 7 courses tasting menu.  The star is definitely the miso black cod with spinach risotto!  Lots of their dishes uses liquid nitrogen and I look forward for their wine list to be finalize."}
{"text":"A new beautiful 2 floor restaurant behind the rink and the iconic Pride of Canada Carousel. Some parking spaces available as well. Inside was lovely too, and had the option of having our coats \"checked in\" which was really a coat rack behind the lectern.  Ordered the Black Cod for $32 which was described on the menu to be miso-glazed black cod on a bed of spinach risotto, garnished with bonito flakes + peashoots + slice of beat. It tasted very delicious and was cooked perfectly; flesh slid off easily. A bite-sized piece of cod along with a forkful of risotto melded in together quite nicely. I did not like the peashoots; it didn't taste good with the cod marinade.   Despite the overall dish tasting really good, I was surprised that even though we ordered from the non-tasting menu, it was still so small. Literally came back home and measured a piece of salmon fillet I had purchased vs the cod piece we received measured L =~3.8cm & W=~8cm. Good thing I had a big lunch so this size was perfect for me. Wouldn't recommend it to someone who was really hungry.  There's lots of potential for this restaurant to improve. My main concern is the tip automation option on the credit card terminals which calculates tip after tax--I wholeheartedly hate this option.   Because I liked this place, I decided to tip 15% BEFORE TAX. The pre-selected gratuity is like paying 30% to 45% on your pre-tax bill which is too much. In any event, exemplary service can warrant up to 20% but on my accord only."}
{"text":"This is a new open restaurant in downtown Markham. French cuisine. We have order oyster for appetizer, steak with fries, T bone steak and lobster tail with mussels. The atmosphere is good, service is ok, they are very pack and busy and I can tell they have not hired enough experience staffs yet, but they have tried their best to serve us. The waiting time of the food is quite long, the food is just ok, the sauce of the steak and fries is bitter. I will say it is a norm for a new restaurant. There is a lot of things still need to improve."}
{"text":"Overall experience 3.5 stars Came here for dinner on Valentine's day.  They have a special price fixe menu, regular menu was not available.   Atmosphere 4 stars  The restaurants have seatings on two levels.  Ground floor feels modern and chic with the open concept kitchen and big windows.  Whereas second floor feels more cozy and intimate. We were seated on the second floor, it felt more romantic with the lights dimmed. Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere.   Food 3.5 stars  First course: beef tartare and tuna tataki  I liked the seasoning on the beef tartare but it's a bit salty. Three small pieces of crostini came with the dish, I would recommend a few extra piece to go with the tartare   Tuna tataki was refreshing but portion is quite small.   Second course: scallops and escargots  Scallops - good flavour, one of the scallop was cooked perfectly but the other one is slightly undercook   Escargots - interesting pairing with the pastry. It was creamy and flavourful   Main: steak frites   Nothing special. But was cooked to the requested liking.  However the garnish/vege portion of the dish was missing from my boyfriend's dish.  Dessert: black sesame nitrogen icecream and molten lava cake   First time trying liquid nitrogen Ice cream.  It had a interesting texture. It was a good light dessert to end the meal   Molten lava cake was rich and paired well with the vanilla icecream  Price 3 stars  The special menu was priced at $75 per person which I find was slightly op. $60 wouldve been more reasonable.  Service 4 stars  Service was prompt and not intrusive. Desserts took a bit longer than expected to get served (around 20min after main course) but we didn't really mind as we were chatting."}
{"text":"It was fairly easy to get a reservation here for 2 on Friday night. We had an extra friend join us last minute and they were able to accommodate on the spot which was great.   Atmosphere: We were seated downstairs next to the kitchen area where the bar stools are. The design of the restaurant is beautiful however I do find it to be noisy and difficult to talk as sound seemed to stay within the dining area combined with the sounds from the kitchen. The view of the carousel and the small 'pool' was nice though. It's not downtown Toronto lake view but definitely still a good one.   Service: The servers and host were friendly and very attentive. They were knowledgeable about their menu and seemed to really take pride in the products of their restaurant.   Beverages: Unfortunately they don't have their liquor license yet so that was definitely a downside for me on a Friday night after a long weekend of work. Plus some of the dishes would've really went well with some wine!   Food: We ordered 3 starters and 3 mains for each of us and shared.  Foie Gras Mousse with Pistachio, Hawthorne Cherry Compote, Brioche - For me this was underwhelming. It tasted pretty good but there is nothing amazing about it that I would order again.  Tune & Salmon Ceviche, Yuzu, Ginger, Crispy Barley and Toast - I actually really enjoyed this dish. There's a layer of avocado at the bottom, then salmon on top and thick strips of tuna on top of that. I'm use to ceviche being a bit more tangy with the lime but this was a refreshing dish.  Beef Tartare - This was my least favourite starter. There was a lack of taste.  Duck Confit - Duck was great. Tender and full of flavour. Especially enjoyed the beer foam.  Black Cod - absolutely enjoyed this dish. The risotto was green and looks a bit like slime but it's delicious and looks different from what you'd ever eat. The cod was so perfectly cooked.  Salmon - I'm a stickler for perfectly cooked salmon and this was really perfectly cooked. The sautéed chick peas and veggies was lack a little bit of flavour. The salmon tasted just as a salmon would so I would hope the vegetables would've had a little more kick to it.   Overall it was an enjoyable dining experience but I can't say I would again."}
{"text":"Booked Terre Rouge for New Year's Eve dinner through OpenTable and there was no issue. I received a confirmation e-mail when I made the reservation and again the day before my reservation. My boyfriend and I arrived a few minutes early and were seated promptly after. The restaurant was not busy at all which was surprisingly on New Year's Eve at 7:15pm.  I initially had wanted to try their regular menu but as it is New Year's Eve, there was a set menu which was $80 per person. They did not offer the regular menu unfortunately in addition to the set menu.   We ordered the following (See photo for description): * Tuna & Salmon (Did not taste fresh, when tasting the salmon you could taste ice as well. My assumption is this was pre made, so this was very unfortunate.) * Butternut Squash Soup (Average at best, nothing special or worth mentioning.) * Seared Scallops (Scallops were NOT fresh! It was such a disappointment and felt the \"foam\" was used to hid the actual quality of the scallops.) * Filet Mignon (DRY! It was not cooked properly as a result it tasted awful, I was so disappointed I couldn't even finish this dish. The best part was the potato gratin which wasn't even that amazing to begin with.) * Miso Black Cod (The spinach risotto that came with the cod was under cooked.)  We ordered the Molten Lava Cake and Mascarpone Cheesecake for dessert. The cake was average and to be honest tasted quite bad. As for the cheesecake, it just tasted like it was infused with lime - an overwhelming amount of lime which made the cheesecake unfortunate.   Overall, for a set menu of $80 per person this was a disaster. We equally felt disappointed with the overall dinner and quality of food that we received. We noticed a couple of things and as a result we felt this place lacked consistency.  * The servers looked flustered (when it wasn't very busy to begin with)  * Other tables received complimentary bread and we did not (it was strange but meh)  * The quality of food was not there (clearly!)  * Service was average at best and took awhile for us to receive our desserts as well (even though she said it would be right out)   We definitely would not recommend. To be honest, we were so disappointed, we didn't bother making any \"complaints\" instead we wanted to leave."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews, but I think it's important that people understand what they are about to pay to subject themselves to.   Sure, it's new and it's cute because it's behind a carousel. But the food was awful. Either too greasey or absolutely tasteless. When I saw the steak, cut into it, and tried to taste it I was shocked--it was chewy and tasteless. I have had steaks (of various price ranges) that taste much better than this one. Our server was polite. The manager was walking around a lot, and was quite frankly constantly disrupting our dinner and making rude comments. I've worked in a restaurant before, and I understand why managers walk around. This one was different. He walked around like an arrogant, judgemental shark. My sweet, friendly mom was too polite to say anything and now I'm confident the next time my mom sees him outside the restaurant, he will definitely treat her poorly because my sister and I came on here to leave our honest reviews. To clarify, classifying someone as a \"regular\" customer doesn't give you the right to call them \"difficult\", or constantly make comments about her adding salt to your substandard food. Your response (saying your manager acted that way because he was treating my mom like \"family\") was nothing but an unprofessional attempt at masking the fact that you have a rude, counterproductive manager.   Try to remember that you are a restaurant that, at the very least, should be aiming towards providing quality food and service. Hold onto your defensive responses and focus that energy on improving your business. You weren't there watching my mom uncomfortably eat her food and take in his unsolicited comments.   We also sat beside some belligerent individuals (talking loudly into their speaker phone for a long time) that the manager saw and didn't do anything to MANAGE the situation, which really added to the awful atmosphere. Last but not least, I also got incredibly sick right after and even into the morning after eating here.   If you are looking to overpay for tasteless food, to be treated unprofessionally during and after your dinner, and to go home with a stomach ache, give this place a go. I cannot remember being so disappointed by a restaurant before. I feel nothing but regret for choosing to bring my mom here to celebrate mother's day.   We will not be going back, and you shouldn't try it either."}
{"text":"Mixed review here. I think the food here deserves a solid 4.5. The service is about a 2-3.  Let's get the not so great out of the way. The service was very spotty. Our main server wasn't very friendly and seemed to have an attitude problem. He also forgot my wine and then I can't hunt him or someone else down so I can remind them of my glass of wine. We also tried to get more bread and I waved at two people but they just turned away or didn't see me even though they were initially looking in my direction. Then finally got another server's attention and asked him for bread. We also had trouble getting ketchup since none of the servers were looking our way or making eye contact even though my friend was waving her hand. There's nothing worse than going to a restaurant and being ignored. Not by one person, one time but by four people and then having my request forgotten about. The only friendly face that actually also made eye contact with us was this one Asian male server. Everyone else was not smiling and didn't even look our way.   When the food did come, it did shine. Our party got the streak frites, the black cod, and I think we tried all the desserts. Food wise, everything was perfect. Steak cooked perfectly. Cod was small but very tasty. Home made gelato was amazing and so fresh and fruity! The sesame ice cream was very interesting and fun to eat. Price was decent for French fusion. Glad to have this addition to the uptown Markham community. If the food wasn't so amazing, I would never consider coming back but we really did enjoy the food. I just wish the service would be raised up a notch as well."}
{"text":"Lunch with co-workers - party of 8 ppl  Service - 1 star. Typical Chinese restaurant service - No service. No friendly smile and greetings. The waiter did not check on us during the meal. ** Note - we requested for separate bills and the waiter asked one of my coworkers to hand the bill to each person in the party. WTH??!! I am giving 1 star because the waiter refilled our water.  Food - 2 stars. BLAND and lukewarm food. I have ordered \"Lamb\" from the lunch menu. The dish is 95% store bought pasta with bland tomato sauce + 4% cheese with no cheese taste + 1% of braised lamb with no lamb taste. 1 star is for the presentation and 1 star is for No msg that I did not get sick after the meal. ** Note - you have to ASK for bread and butter. Otherwise, they won't give it to you. ** Comments from coworkers - Black Cod: too sweet. Duck confit: sauce is sweet. Calamari: TOO MUCH BATTER. Can't taste the calamari. Soup - bland chicken broth.   Price - way over priced. Totally not worth it. $3 for a very small cup of poor quality coffee (about 40% of a tall Starbucks coffee) - no refill. $ 4 for pop.   In conclusion, I would not recommend this restaurant. I will not return."}
{"text":"Dropped by Terre Rouge after its grand opening, all excited for date night at this new French bistro... but left with a lot of disappointment? Overall, I would give food 2.5 stars, service 2 stars and ambiance 2.5 stars. However, I do note that this is a new restaurant and is probably working out the kinks.   BEEF TARTARE ($16) The grass fed Angus beef tasted fresh with the quail egg. It was served with a couple slices of thin toast, and I thought the toast was a little too hard but this could be a personal preference. It was presented beautifully and a good starter - a try if you like your tartare!  LOBSTER & MUSSELS ($33) For the price of $33, I expected better quality seafood and better portion. It was served with a bowl of mussels and half a lobster tail. The mussels were quite small and a handful of them were sandy, and the sauce/chilli was thin and not very flavourful. I would not recommend this dish.   DUCK ($25) This was quite a confusing dish to me. The duck itself was cooked perfectly and it was presented beautifully; however, the sauce was overwhelmingly sweet. I ended up trying to avoid sauce on the duck and whipped potatoes. Also, I didn't really understand the beer foam on the side... Perhaps there was a special way to try it?  Throughout the dinner service, our table didn't receive a lot of attention. Our server didn't try to start up conversation with us, except for asking if he can take away the dish. There was a point where we weren't finished with our food, the server already tried to take away the dish. We noticed other tables getting more attention, and small talks with the manager. Overall, service was curt, and we felt like they were trying to turn our table over as soon as possible.   As for ambiance... We were seated on the main floor, in between 2 other tables of two, with a thin gap in between us. We were practically beside each other, and we could hear their conversations - to the point that I couldn't even hear my own boyfriend just across the table. (It almost felt like a lunchroom seating/the seating arrangement at Salad King...) The seating upstairs might be better, it seemed a lot more spacious and quiet.    All in all, would I come back? Perhaps a second try since I noticed other reviews complimenting the black cod and steak."}
{"text":"Firstly , the waiter's attitude is not patient at all. Secondly, the lobster and mussel are not make clean enough even though the smell not right. Thirdly, the manager isn't apologize and after that the waiter's action isn't gentle. I'm not recommend to my friends. We are not happy about this. B/c we are Asian?"}
{"text":"I really liked the warm duck salad and cheesecake...but was quite upset with the poor customer service on a supposed high end restaurant on three occasions. We were a party of 10 on Father's Day and I suppose this  restaurant clearly could not handle the volume of customers and snap  under pressure.  First incident: my nephew felt something poke him in his back on the padded couch seating. To our surprise we saw a nail about to pierce through the fabric. Our server apologised and advised there is NOTHING HE COULD DO. My husband became agitated and asked \"Do you have tape? Something to tape to the surface?!\" He replied I will see what I can do and came back with a napkin and a roll of tape.   Second incident:  Half our table ordered the scallop carpacio as part of the $60 fixed prix menu. The  server recommended that we dip our bread in the sauce (I thought that dish was too sweet btw) but he will get us some more bread since we have already the first basket. We almost finished the scallops and I waved him down to tell him we were still waiting for our bread. Instead of apologising and assuring us he will bring some more bread as quickly as he can, he said \"YOU ALREADY HAD SOME. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE TOO MUCH AT ONCE OR THE BREAD WILL BECOME SOGGY. THIS IS THE BEST WE CAN DO, OK?\"  Third incident isn't ours; read Vivian N's review. We sat across from her and heard the commotion. It was upsetting to hear the manager/staff raise her voice at her customers as she walked away. That did it for us. We will not come back."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night for dinner around 5:30 pm. My date and I had the whole place to ourselves. It wasn't until around 6-6:30 when it started getting busy. We opted for the tasting menu which was $85 and we had high expectations for such a high price.  Let's talk about the food:  Amusebouche (black truffle on toast with Parmesan cheese) - It was good except the Parmesan cheese overwhelmed the black truffle.  Tuna (ceviche, yuzu, ginger, crispy barley) - This was standard. I liked the yuzu but the citrus was a tad overwhelming if I was being critical.  Foie Gras (mousse, pistachio, Hawthorn cherry compote, toast) - I've never been a fan of mousse foie gras because I find the texture weird and it loses its taste.  Carrots & Beets (goat cheese, candied quinoa, maple tarragon vinaigrette) - This was good but not a standout.  Black Cod (mizo glaze, spinach risotto, peashoots) - This is the highlight of the night. The fish was perfectly cooked and the mizo glaze wasn't too sweet. I would come back just for this.  Panna cotta palate cleanser (bonus) - They were kind enough to give a palate cleanser that wasn't part of the tasting menu. I personally thought it was a weird choice to use panna cotta as a palate cleanser because it's almost a dessert. I was expecting something pickled but this sort of worked (but not really at the same time). I was just a bit confused.  Duck (confit, charred corn, whipped potato, beer foam) - I thought that the beer foam went well with the duck but my boyfriend didn't think so. The duck itself was done well but the teriyaki sauce was a bit on the sweet side. It doesn't help that the corn is also sweet.  Mascarpone Cheesecake (hazelnut brittle, balsamic reduction, seasonal fruits) - This was a very weird dish. I can't say I like it or hate it. The texture of the cheesecake is very much like melted cheese, it's very hard to pull apart (very cheesy and stretchy). The balsamic reduction paired with the cheesecake was not my favourite. I think the balsamic reduction would've worked if they put less on the plate.  The tasting menu in general is very Asian inspired. I feel like this restaurant is going for a French-Asian fusion. I also find the tasting menu to be very sweet and sugary. Five out of the eight dishes had some sort of sugar involved. I know it's a very weird comment but it really affected the overall flavours of the tasting menu. By the time we got to the duck confit, I almost couldn't finish it because I was so overwhelmed. The timing of the tasting menu was also quite fast. That's usually not my complaint at a restaurant but because we were the only people at the restaurant, they brought out everything a tad too quickly.  The service was good and the people were friendly. I think I'll give them several more months to work out the kink and I might go back to try their a la cart items."}
{"text":"Just got yelled at by the owner who tried to justify $12 melted sorbet by arguing that it's hot and humid today. Are you guys even running a business? I have never felt the need to write a review but this was actually ridiculous."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. We were super excited to see a new restaurant open in our neighbourhood, until we actually tried it. Unfortunately, the one star is for food, service, and value.   My mom, who lives downtown, was excited to see this restaurant and wished to try Terre Rouge bc it is so close to my home. We walked in at about 3pm ish, about a month or two after their grand opening. It wasn't too busy but they had a few tables leaving as we got seated and a larger group coming in for dinner as we were on our way out. -yes, that's how long we waited for our food...  We walked in, no one greeted or acknowledged us for a couple of minutes and then finally someone came by and seated us. It was all good until we ordered our food and only one of our dishes came out. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad and my mom ordered a duck confit. I thought my dish was ok.. and then I was almost done with it, I had to refrain myself from finishing it bc my mom's dish wasn't ready yet. (I'm a slow eater, btw) We tried getting someone's attention to ask about her dish, no one came around or bothered to see how I was doing with my salad and with an update to my mom's dish. Finally, her food arrived and she was sorely disappointed, as the protein was dry and tiny, over a bed of French fries! We were expecting mashed potato, as the waiter said but, French fries they were.   Anyhow, this is our journey as to how we saw the lunch crowd leave the restaurant as we were seated and then saw the dinner crowd come in as we asked for the bill. For such a highly anticipated, new coming, French Bistro in our 'hood, Terre Rouge was a sore disappointment, both to me, my mom, and even my friends who have visited the restaurant more recently.  Don't bother, take your $$ elsewhere. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"There's a lot of potential about this place, but unfortunately it did not deliver. The quality of meats and veggies are good, but their execution did not do them justice. The one dish that I was genuinely pleased was the Beef Tartare...other than that, other dishes felt a bit of a miss. There's always an incomplete taste to the dishes I order. And their duck tasted more like Peking Duck than what they are selling, which is French cuisine.  The biggest turn off was seeing our wait staff bringing our dishes and utensil and consistently accidentally have their hands touched the food or the tip of the fork where we would have to eat with. I honestly wanted to bring something up, but their attitude always seem very unpleasant and rushed. Maybe it's the fact that they were busy...but a little smile or gentle recognition would have gone a long way than treating us like we were getting in their way."}
{"text":"Only reason why this place got two stars is because it has really good appetizers!!  Would probably wait for Ruth Chris to open up next door for a steak...   There biographies in three website say they are experienced chef and service managers... didn't get that impression at all... the only service that was good was they kept feeding us wine  Table bread was served after all the appetizers were finished  Streaks were not seared at all and I think it was AA quality... also came precut.. it's was chewy and flavourless.. just look at the picture of the steak..  Didn't offer any fresh until I asked for it... I even waited for them before i asked them.. cuz I was testing their service professionalism... our table of 10 orders 5 steaks...  Steak was sooo garbage. I didn't even eat it all.. this has never happened to me before"}
{"text":"Great ambient, we booked table on Friday night for four of us. We had a great time here. Offer good selection of wine list. Great server help us to pick the great choice of courses though out!!! Definitely a must go place in Markham."}
{"text":"We visited on a busy Friday with my wife and a friend. The decor of the restaurant is modern. We liked the open kitchen concept from where we sat on the main floor. The service was professional and courteous. The carrot and beet salad was extremely good and fresh and reflects their farm to table philosophy. The calarmari was also nice with a generous portion. For my own liking, it was slightly salty and the batter a bit too thick.   The miso cod dish was nice with a very good taste to the fish. However, the portion size is of the dish in general is towards the smaller size so if you are very hungry this won't fill you up. My friend ordered the salmon dish which she really enjoyed and it was a generous portion.   Sitting beside the windows is a bit cold but I'm not sure what can be done about that.  Overall, we had a pleasant experience and look forward to trying other dishes and hopefully the menu will be seasonal."}
{"text":"We came on a Thursday night. The restaurant was about 3/4 full and there was a small party of about 10 or so people in the upstairs area. There was only the owner, a waiter, and a busboy working the dining room.  The decor was very nice.   The menu options were limited. The prices were higher than what we feel the food quality and quantity should be.  Our waiter was fantastic!!! Very professional & attentive. If we could rate our server alone, he'd get 5 stars easily. The owner, however, was absolutely terrible!!! He forgot about us, told us to \"hold on\" when we tried to get his attention, and when we finally got to speak to him and remind him that he had forgotten our water, he shrugged and walked away.    We witnessed the larger party complaining to the server that they weren't being attended to accordingly. So, the waiter took the initiative to help but then got yelled at by the owner \"Why are you touching my table? Don't touch my table.\" We couldn't believe how unprofessional the owner was. And, to have said that in front of customers was unacceptable!  We will not be coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"Terre Rouge is a beautiful restaurant conveniently located in downtown Markham.  It serves contemporary French cuisine which is hard to find in the area.   I came here for lunch with a client and she really enjoyed the experience. From the hostess to our awesome server Andrew, to the manager and last but certainly not the least, the chef, everyone made us feel really welcomed. It was truly a 5 star service experience.   In terms of the price, I thought it was very reasonable. We both ordered the lunch prix fixe menu for $22 which comes with 2 courses.  I ordered a salad and the black cod and it was delicious. The salad was simple but very refreshing with a creamy vinaigrette dressing, pickled red onions, roasted cherry tomatoes and a sprinkle of sun flower seeds.  I loved my cod on a bed of edamame beans and chickpeas.  It was juicy and uber flavourful.  The chef told us despite it looks like a simple dish, it's not. The cod was marinated for over a day while the vegetables are simmer in free range chicken broth. Healthy and delicious! My cup of tea.   This is a great venue for client meetings and private functions as they do have a second floor with a projector screen.  Lastly, I would be remised if I didn't compliment our awesome server Andrew. He is super professional, attentive, and accommodative.  My client didn't realize her duck confit was served with fries, Andrew offered to change it to a salad for her.  She was very pleased.  When we asked for the directions to the ladies room, Andrew personally walked us up the stairs.  This is a gesture that is only seen at high end restaurants.   I will definitely host my next client event here and bring my friends back."}
{"text":"Mediocre, at best.  Came here for their holiday/Christmas eve dinner (yes, this review is FRESH). Although I've seen some mixed reviews about this newly opened restaurant, I decided to come here to try for myself. Was I disappointed? In some ways. Would I return? Read on.  We arrived early for our reservation. The manager (I think it was the manager) was courteous and said our table was not ready yet, which was fine, and said we can sit and wait for a bit. He suggested we can sit by the bar and wait since sitting by the door might be a bit cold. That was quite nice of him, I thought. I then asked him whether we could get a seat upstairs; he said he'll definitely try should a table become available at the time, but if not we'll have to sit on the main floor. And when the time came, we sat downstairs by the window, which was okay since we could look out at the falling snow.  Onto the food first. The menu was set, similar to Winterlicious, except the price point was a bit higher. For appetizers, the salmon tartare tasted fresh, but a bit too sour for my liking. The colours were pretty nice and vibrant. The other app: carrots and beets were just a bit on the small side, otherwise things were fine there. The truffle pizza was pretty good; it would've tasted better if it was a bit warmer. The second dish: scallops, were cooked nicely; not over cooked at all. The sauce also gave it a nice finish. Onto the mains: steak frites - the steak was quite tender to my surprise. Not much effort was needed to chew it at all. We upgraded the fries to truffle fries, which we probably could've passed. The fries on its own did have nice flavours, though. The black cod by far was my favourite dish of the night. The texture was perfect; nice and tender. And, it carried a light sweetness to it. For dessert it was either coconut creme brulee or mascarpone cheesecake. The creme brulee was normal, nothing out of the ordinary. The 'cheesecake' surprised me (see photo), but it still tasted good, I was just expecting an actual piece of cake. The presentations for all the dishes were pretty nice.  What disappointed me the most was probably the service. To me, even if the food at a restaurant isn't as great, as long as the service is amicable, it makes up for the food that much more. Now, I can openly say I am less than a fan of the assistant manager here (she is introduced on the restaurant's IG in case you're wondering). I don't think I've ever received a borderline cut eye from an employee of an upscale restaurant before. But, I guess there's a first for everything *shrugs. When I made the reservation 2 weeks ago, I asked what they usually do if there's a birthday person at the table. They said they can offer a dessert with 'happy birthday' written on it and such, and proceeded to input that into the system. Fast forward to this morning, I called to double check they had that 'note' in their system and they said yes. You probably see where I'm getting at here. Fast forward some more to when our bill came (surprise, surprise) no birthday whatever was given, which wasn't the real issue. We paid our bill, then I asked the AM if there's anything they do for birthday guests. She said that would need to be requested at the time I made my reservation. I said I know... because I did that twice. She paused... then gave me a less than pleasant expression and said 'We'll handle it'. We waited and discussed among ourselves whether we should wait, or just leave it at that since she didn't seem too pleased about it. But, just when we were getting up to leave, the dessert came (no congratulatory from the AM of course). Having studied hospitality myself, customer service is the number one thing in this industry. It was unfortunate she didn't understand that. Just to round things off, our server of the night (not sure what her name was) was very nice :)  Very, very mixed feelings about this restaurant. It's a bit more than likely I won't be returning... at least not until the AM understands what 'customer service' is :)"}
{"text":"3 for the food, 2 for the service.  Beef Tartare ($16) Grass Fed Angus Beef with a Quail Egg, served with brioche. This was okay, nothing special.   Foie gras ($15) Foie gras Mousse topped with pistachio bits, served with brioche. This was okay, nothing special. The mousse had a very light foie gras flavoring. Not worth the price.  Bone Marrow & Escargots ($18) Of all the appetizers, this was probably the most bang for your buck. 2 pieces of bone marrow, each with 4 pieces of escargots on top. It was served with toast on the side, which i thought it was odd cause it was literally a normal slice of bread toasted. The bone marrow was really good, the escargot lacked a bit of flavor.  18 oz Aged RIbeye ($49) Cooked medium rare, it was a little more on the rare side but I didn't mind it. The meat wasn't as tender as I hoped it would be. Lacked a bit of flavoring and was a bit too charred for my liking as it tasted more burnt than well seasoned.  Truffle Frites ($9) I really liked the frites. When it said truffle frites I thought there would be a few shavings of truffle, but turns out it was just topped with parmesan. I guess they used truffle oil.  Not sure why but we didn't get much attention or service for the night. But the weirdest thing was, it was just our table! The owner walked around chatting all other tables asking how their meals were and checked in from time to time, but not a peep at our table. Two things bothered me the most that night. The first thing, our server would come and ask to take away a plate but knowing there's still food on it, he asked one of us to quickly take the food so he can take the plate away. Thing is, it's not like its taking up space and another dish was on its way. The second thing that bothered me the most was I saw our server noticing we wanted to ask him something but he purposely did not make eye contact. The table beside us sat down when we were in the middle of eating our appetizers but they ended up finishing their appetizers and were served their mains before we got our mains. When our server served them their mains, he glanced and was wondering where our mains were (me too right?), but he never came back to address it until we asked 5 mins later. After the server told us it would take another 3 mins he did come back with a tuna ceviche on the house. I appreciated the gesture given it was tasty too, but didn't quite change my perception of the service.  Don't think i'll be coming back."}
{"text":"The most amazing food ever. The service was amazing, the music was great, and the portions for the price were very decent for the quality. We had the fois gras poutine with ox tail jus (which they cook for 3 days!), the duck entree, the miso infused black cod, and for dessert the passion fruit sorbet and he liquid nitrogen black sesame ice cream chocolate lava cake. We wanted to lick the plates clean. Everything was delicious! Such an amazing restaurant! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeded my expectations. The food was outstanding and so was the service. The wine we ordered went perfect with our meal. Everything was plated very nicely. We were staying at the Marriott next door and it was a quick 3 minute walk. Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The WORST restaurant EVER!!!! my frd and I are both foodie, want to try something different. Find the restaurant on open table. The is the far most disappointed restaurant we have been to. The food is fishy, burned (all black) overcook, the claim is bad and it smells. To be honest, I hope right now i am not going to have food poison. The service is bad! very very bad!!! OMG i told them that the food is overcook and all burned they told me \"i don't think we can cook for you. We are not going to cook for you today \" !!!!! are you kidding me what can of restaurant treat customer like that. We pay for it and this is how you guys treat the customer?? One more thing, the knife they bring to me have leftover vegetable!!! ewww are you expecting me eating some random ppl's leftovers??  Super disappointment."}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant that turned out to be nothing else but a nice looking place. They charged high end price and provided barely half the value. The food tasted fine if they had charged 30-40% less. $27 cheese plate with cheeses the servers could not name or describe and tasted nothing more than cheeses you can get at Costco. \"Local vegetables\" as a side dish included kale and zucchini, when there's still snow outside, not sure if they sourced them locally in a nearby supermarket? Server couldn't tell you if the bavette steak was grilled or seared, and was condescending when she asked if we knew what anchovies were because they were used in Caesar dressing...  Unfortunate experience here at this restaurant. Don't encourage them by going. It's unacceptable to charge high price simply because the neighbourhood can afford it without proving the dining experience that's worth the price. You will be better off going to milestones close by.  Update: Just saw the response. Glad the restaurant still cares enough to respond. That said, if you have all these great information, then perhaps use the time you monitor reviews on Yelp and train your staffs first. Any restaurant can say the ingredients are high quality but if it doesn't translate to the food, then charge less or change your recipe. The cheese plate taste like it's worth $15 at best. One can easily find better steak frite for $28 in Toronto. $240 for 3 people can get you a very good meal at Aloette in downtown. And it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Their service is terrible, food is extremely overrated. People, DONT GO TO THIS POS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"The restaurant is French inspired as they never stated it is French bistro. The service was friendly, super professional and the waiters aren't Asian too so not sure why the other comments stated a typical Asian service. ( maybe the managements are?) my favorites are the cod and truffle fries. Some places either make it too salty or too crispy truffle fries but this place has the perfect one. Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"On Victoria Day, I thought to myself, time for my diet to take a holiday... wait, it was always on holiday. So here I am again chilling with pretty lady, and pretty me. We order the tasting menu, my friend said she just had it last month... but surprisingly they do change the content of tasting menu, it was different than what she had a month ago! This is what other restaurants are lacking, creativity and reinvention. And yea, we also get the full pairing along with it. They are pretty big glass, no kidding. The octopus ink fried oyster was especially well thought, crunchy and savory. The grape and scallop was really light, the grape was slightly too sweet. Then there's the famous foie gras... so Good and savory, this is where I was suppose to turn towards my date and tell her, you are too fat, let me help you, earning a slap on my face, with her possibly storm out and me finishing her plate too. But she saw right through me. Escargot puff pastry was interesting... never try escargot this way before. Then there's this plate of cabbage roll deception... it's actually a spin on the traditional Chinese cooking of cod. It's like going French French French and boom Chinese cooking then French again. Nice surprise. The motten lava cake was nice. The place is a cozy place with bar on second floor, parking was at the back with lots of space. I will certainly come back and try another course of tasting menus."}
{"text":"I use this part of my review to sum up the place. Here goes. Fat people and babies are hidden upstairs and the food both times i went wasn't very good anyway.    .  Actually the upstairs is way more comfortable than downstairs but I didn't like the woman at the podium looking me up and down, making a quick face then telling me I had to go upstairs. Super customer service. At least smile while you are judging me. Geesh.   I'm not even counting the slight in the two star rating this is based solely on food.    It's a mediocre restaurant that is pretending to be a high end French restaurant but has neither the decor or quality of food to reflect that. Oh nor is the service anywhere near anything you'd expect at any high end place. Not even lower end.  I've gotten better service and food at any Kelsey's I've gone to  The last time I went I spent almost 100$ on three over priced dishes. One tasted good the other two were not. I had never felt robbed before leaving a restaurant . I firmly believe that you get what you paid for and I most definitely did not.  The carrot and beet salad which was terrific. I noticed it's not on the menu anymore. Too bad. It was actually good, pricy for carrots and beets but so good  Truffle frites:  so salty I wasn't finished. When I said it was very salty, it was explained to me why I was wrong and it was fine. I had been before they  weren't so salty. What a waste.  Mushroom risotto: I love mushroom risotto and if it's on a menu I'll order it.  So I tried making risotto once and it was a disaster. That was still better than what I got.  The rice was wrong, it tasted bad, and once again it was so salty it was hard to swallow. I offered a taste to others at my table and they turned it down because \" the portion is so small if we all try it most of it will be gone\". It was a main. Once again when I spoke up was informed that again I was wrong that it was fine. Um.. ok. Everyone at the table agree it tasted bad and was salty. I guess we are all wrong.   Duck leg: One duck leg. Beer foam. Got the beer foam ten minutes after it was placed in front of us.    Scallop App of the day. They took one scallop, sliced it in 4 pieces and drowned it in sauce.  Disappointing. They sold it to the table as something spectacular.  Staff. Our one server was really nice the next one was so overwhelmed I felt like I should offer to help clear tables.  The upstairs section is completely full and one person serving the whole section. The one nicer person you could tell was experienced and was hustling but still, wanted another drink and couldn't get her attention. The time with the overwhelmed person. Same thing.I felt bad for them .   If you do end up going, order a whole bottle of wine for your table.  Chances of getting a second glass of anything is low. Also took 15 minutes to get our bill both times. I was surprised it took so little time considering how busy they were.  So I'll never be back ."}
{"text":"Heard about an upscale French influenced restaurant and knew I had to try. The decor on the bottom level is nice: dim lighting, wood finishes, and open kitchen. That being said I think the upper level is nicer with accents on the wall and ceiling.   Service was helpful and always ready to answer any questions.   Unfortunately they didn't have the tasting menu during holiday season so the menu we had was a mismatch of things. Shared the charcuterie board which had a good variety of meats and jams. I was impressed by the cured duck breast but the other meats were otherwise standard (salami, chorizo, etc.) I had the duck leg, which had a crispy skin, a sweet glaze and was cooked nicely. The whipped potato accompaniment was just mashed potatoes so nothing special there. Presentation on my dish was alright but the presentation of the fish dishes (the other in my party had) were noisy and disappointing to the pictures I've seen. Also had the cheesecake dessert which looked superb but tasted just like cheesecake. Hopefully the overall dish quality is higher for the tasting menu.  Would come again to try the tasting menu but the regular menu wasn't anything too special."}
