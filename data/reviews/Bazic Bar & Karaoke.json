{"text":"This place always has a great atmosphere and fun and friendly staff! The fried chicken is the perfect thing to soak up all of those Jameson shots ;) got the ramen this time and it did not disappoint,m, great broth with a tiny bit of spicy to finish it off. They also have karaoke in the back!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot to drink, eat, and sing.  The staff is super cool.  Can't go wrong, check it out if you're a local or visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"We order 14 pieces chicken Togo and the server was kind, but the food was worst.  The salad was dark looks like not fresh at all. And the sauce was not right."}
{"text":"This is the best noraebang we've ever been to! Will definitely come back when I am in town :) I forgot to ask the server's (or owner) name but he was very welcoming and he would come right away when we rang the bell. The food was very good. The equipment was very easy to use. The library of songs was very big so you never run out of songs to sing. Super great experience!"}
{"text":"I have lived my whole life in vegas and love to karaoke. I have been to a couple here in Vegas but by far Bazic is phenomenal! The  food is delicious and the selection of music is incredible. They have a lot of new music from new artist. The beer and prices are reasonable as well . This is definitely my one and only karaoke place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Its an OK.... Joint. Good service. The bartender is really nice and fast. And the menu is good for quick late night apps. The karaoke rooms need to be alil speuced up. But would come back again"}
{"text":"Bring back the old wings! Used to love this place but now they serve wings that are larger than life, might as well serve the whole chicken. No more deri-q. Sad face...  Only upside is that their corn cheese and kimchi fried rice are still tasty."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for my birthday and had a blast. I'm not a huge club person and I didn't feel like going bar hopping so why not grab some friends, get drunk and act like American idols?! Hahaha omg best decision ever. I called in advance to make sure I would have a room. Once we got in they showed me the medium and large room for me to choose and I decided to go with the medium room. I had around 15-20 and it was fine! My friends and I had a blast. We were here for about 4 hours and the price wasn't even as bad as I anticipated!! I definitely recommend to come to Bazic for karaoke!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just didn't come here with the right type of mindset- I wasn't here with a rowdy group, we weren't here to get drunk, and we didn't do karaoke. Regardless, the place was dead on a late Friday night.   Food isn't bad, but it's hella overpriced. It's just wings, and they're not even that great. They're not too small, but quality does not justify the prices here. No reason to spend $15 on 10 wings or $15 on a \"shareable-size\" shaved ice dessert.   Service is nearly nonexistent and doesn't speak much English. Menu is difficult to understand and looks like a middle school student put it together with ClipArt and forgot to use spellcheck."}
{"text":"Good place for karaoke night! 20 an hour, but if you spend over 50 you get 10 bucks off. This place has a nice song list and clean rooms. The servers are very nice and they are quick. We never had to wait to get a room. If you get the chance def try the monster fries!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times over the past 9 years and always loved it. I just left because it was almost 40 minutes and we couldn't even get one drink, not with a large group, just two people. I had to flag down the waitress and she said it was because \"the drinks I ordered were hard to make and had to be grinded\". I have ordered those drinks before and of course they did not take 35 minutes.  Also the place was near empty when we arrived. Any yelp users know of a good Korean bar for drinks? The advice would be greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Late night random karaoke nights are the best!   We decided to come here because Zizzy wasn't very welcoming. We did a small room for $20 a hour but when you spend over $50 you get $10 off karaoke.   We were here from 2 am til 5 am! It was a blast and the gentleman that was working was very attentive. He gave us two free sakes because he forgot. They have a extensive song list and sound system is pretty bumping too!   Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"I went to this karaoke place with some friends and I will be recommending this place. It's in the busy street of China town but I like the place. I love the room for their karaoke because it accommodated 10 of my friends. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place to come Saturday night!! Aside from the amazing drinks, the food is fantastic including the best Musabi I've tried in Vegas. Thanks for the great service as always Eric and Saehee!"}
{"text":"I come here often with various friends and family and it is by far one of the best karaoke joints in town. I also often recommend this business to many others as well! However, my last visit was very disappointing. I had visited their website, and there was a coupon under the \"Promotions\" tab that stated that if you have a $50 tab or higher, they will deduct 50% off the total bill. They did not honor this during my last visit, even though this coupon did not have an expiration date listed on their website."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the watermelon soju was always bomb. Also if you like something quick and greasy, the cheese corn is always a good thing to go for."}
{"text":"An evening of fun getting our celebrity on.  A night with a few celebrations and meanings.  For a first time at a karaoke joint where parties are given private rooms to belt out including laughter, this was plain enjoyable!  Simba was our courteous server throughout the event.  Actually another lady was helping too but didn't catch her name.  Apologies there... But Simba gave us a quick tutorial on the equipment, explained food items before taking our order, and checked on us frequently throughout the night.    For our friend Clarise's new job, he gifted her a watermelon paradise.  Really cool of them!  It was prepared so pretty and artisticly, the display is like a centerpiece (see pic).  I'd say we had a good 4 hours or less to eat, drink, and sing.  Pricing is per room by the hour; and not per person.  I think that's better.  Since this place also serves drinks, bar items, appetizers and food plates.  I like the idea that they offer it this way.  The establishment is also available for dining without karaoke and bar hangouts.  One thing I do question, as one of my yelpette friends pointed out, was whether the shells and rocks in the restroom sink were sanitary.  Similar thought I had while washing my hands was eeuuuw all the germs that wash down it - don't touch them - although stylish.  My friend is right... Looks like it needed to be bleached washed cuz around the edges inside of the sink looked a little filthy.  Anywhobees, new management here so the name is now a18.  Still recommending a chance for your few minutes of celebrity vocalist status behind closed doors here.  It IS really fun! Book a bunch of people.  Have some drinks to clear your throat and belt out those octaves! 4.5****"}
{"text":"Fun place! Friendly staff and soju for daaaays. Food is over priced IMO. Drinks are priced relatively good tho. CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Came here one night with a large group of friends for karaoke.  It was quite busy.  Drinks were plenty, especially yogurt soju and beer.  The song selection was entertaining and we had a good time!  Only got to sample a few food items like the fries and wings so can't really judge them on food, but it was good enough for a few hours of fun and service was excellent so we'd definitely return next time."}
{"text":"Staff was very attentive when we walked into the place. I went with a big group and they have these rooms where the karaoke is in. The song book is very extensive and rooms have a disco ball.  The food was really good , we had wings and other extras. They have a great selection of drinks to choose from at good prices. Would recommend this place for people looking to have a fun time."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided spur of the moment to have a karaoke night and ended up at Bazic. They only had the largest room available (which is more money per hour), but when it came time to pay our bartender gave us the standard rate! We all really appreciated that!   They have a good selection of songs (sadly no Ice, Ice Baby though) and the machine had more than what was even listed in the book. It was difficult to use the remote at first, but once you knew what you were doing, it was a breeze.   I would totally come back!"}
{"text":"Bazic is a pretty good alternative whenever Qkaraoke is fully booked, which happens quite often on weekend nights.   The song selection is up to par with the song selection at Q. It is pretty updated and includes both old and new songs in various languages.   The service is friendly enough. There is a buzzer in the room, so customers can get food, drinks, or technological assistance whenever they need it. Else than that, the staff are usually at the bar.   The downsides to Bazic are that the rooms aren't all too clean. In fact, I would go as far as to say some of the rooms are on the dingy side. The smaller rooms in particular are very badly lit, so it's difficult to read the song selection sometimes."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! The music selection is great it has not only a lot of oldies but goodies but also a bunch of new stuff!!! The staff is great,  the chef is awesome, and the prices are even better! Best spring rolls of my life are at this place!!! This is ny go to kareoke spot."}
{"text":"Great place to have fun with a group. About 8 of us got a private room and had a good time. Liked the soju. Drink prices were good. We didn't eat, but the food seemed a bit overpriced. Will defiantly be back again."}
{"text":"I reserved a room for karaoke for twenty for a birthday and I had a great time. We had people under 21 so we didn't really have a host, but everyone enjoyed themselves. No one showed us how to use the machine, but we figured it out. They served water which was nice. They had a great selection of music including newer stuff.  We did order drinks at the bar and I thought it was very affordable. I got a bottle of soju for like $20 which is 6 shots of liquor.   The room was affordable for the amount of people. I believe it was $40 an hour, but they do have cheaper rooms for less people.  Overall the staff was nice, the bathroom was clean, and I would definitely karaoke here again."}
{"text":"The rooms food and liquor are overpriced imo.  I like gambling at a bar and getting my drinks free and singing for free as well.  It's not a bad place at all.  If you prefer private rooms it's a blast!  I'm not one of those people."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  So I felt like doing a little karaoke for my birthday and my friend recommended that we try this place! This was my first time here and as soon I walked in the staff was so cheerful and friendly. They were attentive all night and made sure we were enjoying ourselves. Sadly I didn't try the food but people in my party definitely kept ordering all kinds of things... I believe I saw someone chowing down on Ramen? The Soju on the other hand ... yum, yum, yum!!!! My friends and I will definitely be back! TWO thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"No star!!!!!  It was the WORST experience and food ever!!!!   I ordered wings but they gave legs and it was uncooked so BLOOD was in the chicken. Also, the cabbage which comes as a side was very bitter so I couldn't even give a bite!!! I could't eat any from this place but i had to pay all the food!!!   If I fry a shoe, the taste will be much better than the food I got from this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place far exceeded expectations!! We went here on a Saturday and stayed for hours! Very cool place and the staff takes very good care of you!! The drinks are very good nothing was over saturated or anything! The song choices were amazing! Once you make your playlist you just sing away. I like that it scores you at the end good feeling getting that 100!!  Try the Yogurt soju, it was a favorite for everyone!! Seriously everyone tried it!"}
{"text":"I always have a great time here. And I don't always come here to sing. Surprisingly enough, the most of my visits happen to be after a long night at work, winding down with some bottles of soju and some comfort Korean food.   Both the Yogurt Soju and the Peach Soju are my top flavors above all. Be sure to sample those before trying the other flavors but BEWARE- For a drink so sweet and easy to shoot, be sure to keep yourself hydrated since you're more than likely going to feel it later (LOL).  The food definitely complements your palate after a couple hours of drinking, ranging from soups to rice dishes with everything in between- A pretty standard late-night Korean menu. I loved everything that I've tried so if you're eyeing that one item, order it! Chances are you'll be satisfied with your decision.  The karaoke rooms are clean and spacious while the song selections are quite up to date. The larger your group, the better. That way everyone can rent a room to battle each other karaoke style, order a ton of food like it's the last supper with massive amounts of Yogurt Soju to go around for hours. Good night indeed."}
{"text":"Bazic recently hired a new chef, Michael, and he is legit. The kalbi ribs are popular but the volcano corn that comes as a side is absolutely addicting."}
{"text":"There was a management change and with that are some pros and cons. I mainly went to Bazic for the fried chicken and karaoke (in that order). With the newer changes, the karaoke set up has been upgraded and they now have wireless microphones so you don't knock over drinks on the table with the wired versions. The fried chicken is subpar, though. Chicken should be floured and fried so it's crusty and crunchy on the outside, but the new chicken is dipped in what seems like a very liquid batter--the kind you would find on fish n chips. C'mon, no one should batter chicken wings like that. If/when I go back, I'm going to have to forego the chicken  and stick to other menu items."}
{"text":"Cool Karaoke spot in Chinatown. You have private rooms and plenty of booze to keep the liquid courage going. Only 1 person in the room knew how to work the remote so he was the dictator of the karaoke room. I didn't try the food, but everyone seemed to like it."}
{"text":"I've only been to Bazic for their drinks. I've never ordered any actual food here. The only thing I've eaten at Bazic is their sampler appetizer platter (fries, tots, etc) that they comped for us during one night of drinking. I think they gave it to us as an apology for not having anything we wanted (drinks wise). HAHA.   The owners & staff is really nice here. We sat at the bar one night and had an awesome conversation with the owner. We were planning a trip to Korea and he had some really good advice for us for when we go. He also told my Korean boyfriend that his Korean sounded foreign so we will probably get ripped off. Thanks boyfriend! HAHA.   I always tend to order some cocktail soju because it is yummier than regular soju. Also, cocktail soju can't be found in Korea. So I'm guess it's a very Americanized thing. We LOVE the yogurt soju, which is pretty much soju mixed in with yakult (those tiny yogurt drinks.) The lychee and peace soju are equally good as well. I did NOT like the watermelon soju at ALL! I've also tried their mixed drinks .. and a lot of them are really sweet so I would probably just stick with the soju.   He also lets you sample the soju so if you don't like the flavor, you don't have to take it! But it's okay. It's alcohol. Just chug it!   Great service. Great drinks. It's never pricey whenever we go either. Super thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My friend has been raving about how good the chicken wings are here since we got to Vegas...so of course we had to stop here. Sad enough, this place was a huge disappointment. According to my friend...the wings used to be huge as if the chicken has been on steroids but they came out to be tiny little wingstop wings. We ordered 20 chicken wings expecting a table of 4 to get full off but that didn't happen. There was 3 flavors available for the wings: original (no sauce), soy garlic (kinda tasted like Chinese soy sauce wings) and spicy (guchujang sauce). I personally preferred spicy out of all three flavors but they were all just okayy wings. Additionally we ordered watermelon soju but that didn't arrive till after everyone finished their meal.   Overall the service was incredibly slow and there wasn't anything special or unique about the food."}
{"text":"This place was alright. It had a terrible smell of smoke and the fan didn't have a protective cover on it. The words and beats didn't match up to the song consistently and we noticed a lot of errors in the lyrics. If you're drunk and can look past that, then I guess this place would be fun. They provide water. Also, when you pay, be sure to go to the front or buzz the host. It's easy to miss the check out area. I haven't tried their food and don't think I'll be returning to try it in the future but overall it was an okay experience."}
{"text":"Bazic has a very nice atmosphere and drinks always come on time. Rooms are almost always available and song selection is superb. Waiters/waitresses are always friendly and willing to assist.   7/7"}
