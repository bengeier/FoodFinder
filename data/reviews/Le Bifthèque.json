{"text":"Earth calling Le Biftheque (Cote-de-Liesse) or further referred to as CDL, if ever you decide to re-open your branch one more time, I strongly suggest have a go at the Boucherville branch to see how your customer's experience should be!!!  Going back 20 or so years ago when le Biftheque was a roaring night out for steak, long lines out the door were a true symbol of it's success. Of the three branches that existed at the time, CDL up north at St. Sauveur or Boucherville, the latter always won me over for the impeccable service that I attributed the customers who were most likely very particular and unforgiving of their expectations. So when these locations closed a few years ago I was disappointed but not surprised since my last time at CDL was not the best.  Fast forward to the re-opening of both CDL & Boucherville I was wanting a pleasant return. You can read my CDL review, er, should I say post mortem? With that in mind I could not wait to try Boucherville at some point which did happen a few weeks ago. Not sure if they are the owners of the previous location on the east side of highway 20.  A friend had helped a better part of the day moving furniture to and fro, so at the end of the day we were both tired & famished, no sandwich or salad would have been justified. Realising Le Biftheque was just on the other side of the Lafontaine tunnel I was salivating for a rib steak!! I am happy to say they nailed it on so many aspects. From the point of our arrival to the finish I kept shaking my head at the dichotomy of how a restaurant brand can differ so much between two locations. Foremost the décor is a world away from the dark CDL setting. The brightness of the lighting and colours gave an air of freshness and confidence. Our waitress, Lawrence was superb and charming having no issues switching to English when my friend was unsure of something, a far cry from what happened at CDL. We both ordered the rib steak special arriving tableside cooked to perfection with the best grill hatch marks I have ever seen. Only upon arrival did I have one regret not asking for the steak to be seasoned prior to cooking, but the 'naked' one I enjoyed allowed me to taste the perfect crust and tender pinkness au naturel.  My wine of choice was a glass of the \"William\" red from the Riviere du Chene winery in St. Eustache, a perfect option instead of my usual favorite Beaujolais-Villages from Georges-DuBoeuf.   I would not hesitate a return since not only my new residence does not allow BBQs on the balcony, but will come back since I know the chances of a good dining experience are possible."}
{"text":"If i could give -1 stars i would, the food is terrible the sides are terrible. The service is ok but i was disapointed, for the price they put n serve food like that is really outrageous"}
{"text":"My family was recommended this restaurant by a couple who can be considered real foodies. Firstly, the atmosphere was suitable for both family or couple dining. The customer service was professional and menus are available in frenxh and english.  Most importantly, the highlight of the night was the beef. I ordered the queen cut - 8 oz aged prime ribs with fries and italian salad, my mother ordered the 12 oz new york steak with mashed po In my opinion, the aged prine rib was succulent and tender and worth the try. I am a small eater so 8oz was mire than enough for me but I think the 12oz is a better option. Overall, it was a good dining experience!"}
{"text":"The food is great (especially the rib steak) a must try! The setting of the restaurant is great and the servers are friendly (always here when I needed something) and very professional. During the habs games you get unlimited ribs all game long! I mean that is given! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cette place est devenue franchement mauvaise. J'avais commandé une côte de buf médium saignant et elle m'est venue cuite de part en part. La serveuse a refusé de me remplacé. La viande était sans saveur et tellement elle était cuité. De plus elle avait l'allure d'une viande qui avait été tapée pour être attendrie. Les frites étaient trop cuites, probablement refrite une deuxième fois. La salade manquait de vinaigrette et pas fraîche, le petit pain toute molle et sentait le moisi. Malgré un discount de 30% pour s'excuser, le rapport qualité prix est beaucoup trop basse. Ne dépensez pas votre argent pour cette merde. Je suis nostalgique de la maison mère qui a fermée sur côte de liesse. Si vous faite un petit tour à Burlington, allez déguster un bon prime rib, rien à voir avec la semelle de botte servi au bifethèque."}
