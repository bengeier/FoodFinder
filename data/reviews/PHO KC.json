{"text":"Excellent small, family-run Vietnamese restaurant in Glendale on 59th just off the 101. Service was friendly and attentive but not overly hovering.  I ordered the Shaken Beef after the waitress said it was one of their most popular dishes. I can see why. It was delicious. The beef was tender and nicely seasoned.  The egg was cooked perfectly and I mixed it into the rice. My friend had the vermicelli noodle salad (bun) with pork. He said it was delicious. Serving sizes were perfect. Prices seemed a bit higher than other Vietnamese restaurants but so good!  Worth every penny. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite and the kids love it too!! Wonderful and kind staff who always have a smile."}
{"text":"Love the Pho Tai here! The staff is always friendly and very prompt. Establishment is extremely clean and you can see pride of ownership! 

Pro tip - Try the chili oil on the table!"}
{"text":"I eat Vietnamese food all over this valley, this one is being close to me is a good choice.  They have a limited menu especially when if comes to seafood.  I have asked a few times for squid, but they say that no one asks for it (except me, so I must be no one  lol) so that's why they don't have it on the menu.  I will still continue to go but I would go a lot more often if they expanded their seafood dishes."}
{"text":"It is a good one. #14 is good and also the spring rolls. The broth ishave lots of falvor and trip, meatballs and meat are tender. I will recomend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"The Best Bánh Mì ?ac Biet in town (Vietnamese Combination Sandwich) If you think Lee's Sandwiches is good, you have to try this. This is way better."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my husband and I found this place! We come as often as we can. Delicious pho at a great price, the Thai tea is really good too. The people who work here are wonderful, always remember our order, very friendly."}
{"text":"Such great pho! I've loved it the two times I've gone. Tonight I went to get pho to go because I'm sick with the flu. I told the gal at the register where I ordered that I was sick so I'd wait in my car right out front while they made it. I told her I didn't want to get anyone else sick. She was SO KIND! Within minutes of me getting in my car, she stepped out and gave me a ginger tea to sip on while I waited to help my flu. If everyone in the world was this considerate, the world would be an infinitely better place!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Pho around the Phoenix area and have to say this was some of the very best no question. Everything was very fresh and full of flavor. We also tried the papaya salad which was excellent. Their other dishes looked very good as well, can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE!

My husband and I came on 3/25 for a early dinner. It was our first time and excited to give it a try

About 10 minutes after leaving we both became violently ill. Turns out we both had food poisoning. 

Not sure which dish is the culprit. I had the Pho Special, my husband had the Bun Bo Hue. Together we shared: grilled pork rolls, Banh Xeo, and a Thai iced tea. 

It was completely empty when we went at 4 pm. 

Will not be back."}
{"text":"Hip hip hurrah for no-animal-product-pho! I'm so glad that this restaurant popped up when I yelp-ed \"vegan\" in Glendale. Their veggie pho is light, flavorful, and not overly salty. It comes with all the regular veggie fixings as well as fried tofu, carrots, cabbage, and baby bok choy (my fav!). My food came out quickly, so it'll be a great spot for those who are looking for a restaurant on their work lunch break. 5 stars for efficiency, staff, location, cleanliness, taste, and menu. Well worth the 8 bucks...I'll be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"Little below average Pho place. Good flavor. Good price. Good service. But very little meat in the Pho bowls."}
{"text":"What a great little Pho place to open up in just the right area! The service here was excellent, very friendly and informative. While simple, the decor was nice and the place wasn't too cramped or anything, just cozy. The prices were very fair and reasonable for what you get. Good, fresh tasting Pho, generous portions, fair prices and a great location. While not the absolute best Pho I've ever had it's certainly worth a visit, I doubt anyone would be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious spring rolls, reasonable prices for pho. Super Vietnamese authentic."}
{"text":"Excellent! Top notch service and wonderful food!! We will tell all our friends and family and look forward to many returns. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow I am so excited this place exists! I work in the area and go out for lunch once or twice a week, and while Cafe Rumba nachos are an absolute staple, sometimes you need a little variety. Cue a big fat bowl of pho -- I had just been complaining about the lack of good pho around here!

Pho KC just opened a couple months ago, and they're dishing out some fantastic Vietnamese cuisine straight out of the gate. You can't go wrong with the pho special, which is what I got, but if you don't like tripe or tendon (a texture thing -- personally I'm a fan) you may want to get the Pho Tai or one of the other options. They definitely make a great bowl: really beefy, flavorful broth and noodles with just the right amount of spring to 'em. 

After the pretty big normal sized bowl (there's a larger size if you're really confident), I felt the need to cleanse the palate with some Thai boba tea; also glad there's boba in the area now! Next time will have to try the banh mi."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very nice. First time trying pho and I was very impressed. Generous size bowls with lots of beef and noodles. Service is fast and place is very clean and nice atmosphere. Everyone there is kind too. Very good experience :)"}
{"text":"I came here soon after this store had opened...I've noticed that over time the owners/staff have been skimping on meat and noodles in their food. To be honest I love the staff, they have always been kind and provided prompt service...but I will no longer be a customer if this place due to the cheapness I have encountered."}
{"text":"Super great and fresh! I'm vegan and the veggie pho was delicious and flavorful (an important yet rare quality for veggie pho). Came here with my parents and they got meat options, and both were pleased with those as well. The service was fast and accurate, and I don't have a bad thing to say about it. Try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town. It has a really good facility and great customer service. If you're looking for a place to relax and enjoy a good pho bowl this is the place."}
{"text":"By far the Worst pho I've ever had in 4 years of living in Arizona. I got the Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) and the broth had zero flavor which is disappointing because Pho is all about the broth, the chicken was cooked well but also had no flavor. I'm not sure if this place is new but they need to reconsider their career because this place and food isn't it. 

Extra note - take out containers are also pretty cheap mostly all Pho places had their broths wrapped in a plastic bag and then put it in another plastic bag with the rest of the fixings but not Pho KC. 

To sum it all up - Terrible takeout experience, flavorless broth this place deserve zero stars and for the people who gave all the 5 star reviews you should really check out any other pho place in the valley I guarantee you'll forget about this place."}
{"text":"You have got to check this place out if you're a vegetarian and looking for something super healthy and super tasty. The service was above par and I couldn't believe there was a place in Glendale finally. This will definitely become one of my Staples of somewhere I go once a week.  Addicting to say the least"}
{"text":"I love the sushi and the staff here. The prices are great and i always leave happy. Try the tempura spicy tuna, its heaven."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018 - 14/100

Although slightly skeptical trying pho here in Phoenix area (since I'm from LA), I decided to give this new place a try rather than defaulting to some of the other vietnamese places in the area. 

This small little Vietnamese place offers more than just pho, however it seems like this is what most people are here for. I like that their portions are just right, soup is not too salty, and didn't taste like there was a whole lot of MSG in it. 

Not bad at all! Best part is it's really close to my boyfriend's school. - can easily come here for a quick fix or for a hangover cure ;)"}
{"text":"Pho KC Vietnamese Restaurant recently opened. The restaurant is casual but also is new and modern. They offer most of your usual Vietnamese Favorites. We wanted to start out with the Potstickers but I hit them when they were all sold out of them so we just went to the entrees.

I had the Stir Fried Lemongrass Chicken with Mixed Vegetables Rice Plate. The Chicken seemed like good quality chicken because the white meat was moist and tender and just melted in my mouth. The Asian flavored sauce was delicious and laced with lemongrass as promised. My plate came with a generous amount of fresh steamed rice and tender crisp vegetables such as baby bok choy, broccoli and carrots. It was a delicious plate there is no reason why anyone wouldn't like it. Some people might point out that fish sauce sauce should be served with this plate.  Other sauces are available on the table.

My husband loves Oxtail so he ordered the Oxtail Pho. He said the clear broth was delicious. He thought it was really good and was spicy. As delicious as the broth was the dish wasn't perfect and not all of the three pieces of Oxtail were edible. He could only chew the meat off of the small piece the two bigger pieces weren't ready yet. But this is a newly opened restaurant and they are still finding their way.

The woman who took care of us was very attentive and eager to make sure we were pleased.

3.5 (because of some undercooked Oxtail but bumped up to 4 stars because they are new)

Worth a Try!"}
{"text":"I had to come to a work site near here and I was driving through the shopping center looking for a place to eat and came here. 

I love eating Vietnamese food and have Vietnamese friends back home who cooked for me growing up, so moving here and not having as much was pretty sad. I try out every place I come across in Phoenix.

This place is legit. People are nice, service is prompt, and the food is great. First visit I got pho, and it was great. Broth was excellent, just everything you want pho to be. Next time I got a vermicelli noodle bowl and it was super good too.

I plan on stopping by here every time I'm nearby for work."}
{"text":"Delicious and so fresh! And our server Kim was so friendly and helpful. The shaken beef was perfect. A very wide range of dishes, easily accommodated everyone's tastes and dietary needs. Tee even offered suggestions and items that were not on the menu, for our vegan daughter. We'll definitely be back again and again. There's so many more things to try!  :)

Went back this week and tried the Crispy Noodle with chicken, beef and shrimps. And this time I remembered to snap a pic. So delicious!  :)))"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very clean and well kept, everything is new as well, seeing as it recently opened a few months ago. My son was given a pristine high chair. There seems to be only one server, which did not pose an issue until more patrons arrived. The server did not fill our waters once, as he was either too busy serving the other 2 tables, or filling napkins/ condiments on other tables. Immediately, we ordered shrimp spring rolls and egg rolls. No small plates were given, so we had to use our napkins to avoid dropping drips and crumbs. Both the spring rolls/ eggrolls were not the best... definitely have had better. I was hopeful there was a tofu pho dish, according to other photos I saw on yelp, however the server informed us they cannot accommodate... so I had to order the chicken pho ga. Upon arrival, the bowl was much smaller than most pho spots (only one size, no options). The broth SMELLED amazing, however the taste was nothing special. I may return on a Monday (as my favorite Pho spot is closed that day), however would more than likely opt to not. Sidenote, while leaving I ordered a Viet iced coffee-- which just may put the Starbucks beside them out of business- it was delicious. :)"}
{"text":"Very tasty pho. It is on the sweeter side and the size I would say is a small/medium, so it is not enough to share. For $8 it's definitely worth it. Comes out fast and the server was really nice."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho, great other dishes, too! Friendly, clean, fast service, great food, inexpensive! Love to go there!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  My daughter and I have been trying various pho throughout the west valley... one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Pretty great value. Great boba however the bang mi was really lacking a lot of stuff in the bread, even though the quality of the ingredients was pretty good."}
{"text":"Came here around lunch time on a Friday. Wasn't too busy. You can see yourself if you desire to. There is only one waitress working the tables. Service was pretty quick no issues there.

Location is close to Midwestern University. In a Plaza. Parking is easy due to parking lot. Inside is clean. Restroom was okay as well.

Price:
Price for most of the pho, were around $9 -$11 range, which is okay if you get the right amount for the price you're paying. Definitely not on the cheaper side.

Food:
I got these pho Tai with out tendon. Number 16.

Check photo for visualization.
So, quantity of the noodle is little. Quantity of the beef is even less. There was maybe six slices of beef. The amount of noodle is definitely on the Lesser side compared to other places. The broth was okay, it wasn't too greasy, but nothing spectacular.
The side plate with the bean sprouts in the men in the jalapeno, is like all the other places. No issues there.

Overall, for the price you're paying, I was expecting to have more quantity in terms of the noodle and the beef. However that wasn't the case here. But I may need to compare this place to other pho places in Arizona. Because I'm basing my comparison with California and Texas.

If this is the only pho place in this area, you could come check it out. However if you're really hungry, you probably won't get full.

The service was good though.
And they just open recently I believe."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic ! The waitress picked up on us being vegan quickly without having to be told and made sure we had a great selection of food to eat ."}
{"text":"Me and a couple of friends decided to try this new place.  YUMMMMMOOOOO.  I had the curry, another friend had a banmi sandwich, he liked it so much he had one to go.  Another friend is a vegetarian and loved what she ordered.   Great place, great prices.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Tried to call in an order today & the phone was disconnected."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is delicious and the employees are incredibly friendly. My friend and I have come here on different occasions when we've been feeling under the weather. The main waitress (I don't know her name unfortunately) went out of her way to offer us hot tea with ginger. You can tell not only does she care about her business but also the customers. My favorite pho place hands down."}
{"text":"Good Bahn Mi's, and good price. Can't be $4 sandwiches. 
We had 3 different Bahn Mi and all were delicious."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, food is really good and friendly staff. I highly recommend the \"bo luc lac\". Best Vietnamese restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Pho with beef was very good.  The broth was tasty and had good body.  Nice to know that this place is in this part of Glendale, AZ."}
{"text":"Amazing food, we got the tofu pho and it's amazing.  service and priced correctly. I will for sure return."}
{"text":"Very flavorful vegetarian pho. Lots of fried tofu and bok choy, broccoli, cabbage, and carrots. It was a little salty. I put the usual hoisin sauce and chili sauce but def wish I would of skipped the hoisin. The extra large was the perfect size to share with my daughter."}
{"text":"Excellent rare beef Pho. Quick service at a good price. Definitely coming back for another one"}
{"text":"Pho KC (oh how those Vietnamese love their inappropriate wordplay) is a brand new restaurant at the time of this review (October 2017). It's always nice to have more places opening up in such a bland area, although I'm certain we probably should have waited a few months before giving them a try.

We both ordered a couple of eggrolls and Thai teas. The eggrolls were decent, while the Thai tea, which took forever because they had to cook the boba, was just okay. I ordered a plate of shaken beef, which included rice and an egg that I could mix at my own will. My girlfriend's plate included noodles, veggies, and both beef and chicken (sans the shrimp). 

My dish, which the server said was one of their more popular choices, was excellent. Beef was well seasoned and great quality. Everything meshed well together. My girlfriend, on the other hand, immediately noticed that the chicken was pink and obviously undercooked. Not good. You get a bit of wiggle room with beef, but definitely not with chicken. It was one of the few instances where we had to point it out to the server. Not to kick up a fuss, but just so they're aware for future consistency purposes.

The server apologized and gave us an extra percentage off of our meal. Apparently, since my dish was prepared first, she took the blame for rushing the cook to hurry and finish hers so that there wouldn't be a long gap between servings - a common problem that I've noted in other reviews of similar places.

Overall, the place does have potential, but I think if we return, we'll let some time lapse in order to allow them to iron out their wrinkles."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here, the pho was pretty good, but there was only one server working and she was pregnant so it was a bit slow at times and some things were forgotten, but she was super sweet & workers like that make me want to come back, and I would because prices are very reasonable and the food tastes great, and that's most important."}
{"text":"Solid Vietnamese for Phoenix and Arizona. Nice people. Typical mom-pop Pho place you'd find anywhere. Nothing truly negative. Comfort food."}
{"text":"Food was just OK. Seemed like microwaved dinner. The price is OK. Just a one time visit for me"}
{"text":"Decently priced great broth and the spring rolls are fresh, not old  like some other places. Oh I got the beef broth.  If I'm in the area I'll definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Great pho! All I ask is that you get plastic chop sticks, wood is too rough when eating pho."}
{"text":"Great food and prices. Was a nice night to sit outside. There was only one server but we didn't wait too long for food but we weren't in any rush. Everything we ordered was great with good portions and hot temperature.  We will return."}
{"text":"Customer service is great I had Never eaten Pho before and all I  did was describe what I was looking for and the friendly girl up front was able to point to a dish that suited me ! I loved it . I brought my family back for some to try as well !! Thank you"}
{"text":"Saw the review by Pepper and had to try the oxtail pho also. I mentioned Pepper's review to the server and she assured me they fixed it son all the beef is very tender. And it is!!!!! I'm thrilled to have this place on my way home. We'll be seeing each other a lot more. And ordered a bahn mi to go."}
{"text":"I had the pho special for a late lunch and it was great. Soup was flavorful and they give pots of garnish. The iced coffee beverage I had was great too. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great, well priced food and service.  Tasty, well prepared, served right. You have got to try this."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the service was spectacular. It was so authentic. Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"I used a few other Yelp reviews to decide to go here. It's a little out of the way but it's totally worth it. So good. My daughter LOVES the boba.  The pho was so good and the waitress was the nicest lady in the world. Will definitely return many more times."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here today, the service was great. He was friendly, quick, and helpful when I asked what was in the veggie pho, he went to ask the chef what's in it. 
The veggie pho was amazing, the best by far I've had in the Phoenix area! Flavorful, not too salty, and with fresh veggies and jalapeños to go in it. 
My boyfriend enjoyed the shrimp spring roll things and his shrimp pho as well. 
We will definitely go back next time we want pho!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. Great location. The service was great, the pho was phenomenal, I will certainly be back here many times in the near future. The restaurant was not crowded, everything was clean, and everyone walked away from dinner full and happy."}
{"text":"Finally found a place for authentic Pho !
Service was fast and pleasant. Pho was delicious. 
Would be 5 stars if ambience was nicer, but price was reasonable, so there you go."}
{"text":"Vegan options were very good. The broth on the pho chay was amazing, and meatless! Veggie noodles and spring rolls are also tasty. Nice atmosphere, very clean, and friendly service. Our new favorite on this side of town."}
{"text":"Excellent food great service great price too. Keep up the good work!  I had the grilled pork with vermicelli noodle salad with spring roll it was so delicious I ordered more to take home. Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly and clean place ! Has plenty of veggie options!! Papaya salad and pho is great !! Their spring rolls are great . Thanx"}
{"text":"Good place to eat on the west side. I ordered a pho with sliced beef #17 with a grilled pork sandwich. It was good by most standards. Sandwich bread was better than most. I'm just glad to more varieties of places to eat here on the west side."}
{"text":"Great spring roll and pho. We got our food fairly quick which made it a great stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices and friendly services. I try pho and my friend have \" bo luc lac\". It's really good too. Definitely come back."}
{"text":"Called in after a long day of work and order some pho and a spring roll. They always get my order right and taste pho-king amazing every time. Thank you for the quick service and always getting my order correct."}
{"text":"At a time where my soul isn't happy, this veggie pho is definite comfort food.. amazing. My best pho place prior feels like a 7/10 to this 10/10 place hands down. The broth is rich  and hot and the furthest thing from watered down like some others tend to be."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times and tried the pho, banh mi, and banh xeo. All were super good. They have their own particular style of banh xeo that is different than I've had, but extremely good. They have an optional spicy fish sauce with it that totally makes it. Pho and banh mi are what you would hope for and are good with good portions that fill you without giving you broth belly. Staff is super friendly and helpful. I recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Grilled pork banh mi was very delicious! I think I could easily eat two of them and will definitely be coming back for more. We also tried the #19 pho beef with flank which was also good. It didn't contain a whole lot of meat but was still pretty filling."}
{"text":"Excellent special pho. Have had it many times here. Get it to go on a cold winter night.  

Call in ordering fast and problem free. Friendly employees. They have 10 min parking in front for pickup but sometimes people use them for long term parking."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my recent visit to Pho KC!! I was so excited to see a new phone place, especially in the area that I work! I was greeted promptly, seated and given water, the restaurant was clean, I loved that...I ordered the pho Dac Viet and egg rolls. I was really impressed with how quick my food came out. It's very flavorful and they had bigger portions too, so for the price of an average bowl of pho. It was a good amount I got for less than 9 bucks! What a deal! I went up to pay and the cashier had a full on conversation with me, which is very rare, knowing the Viet culture. She was very friendly!! I will definitely be back to support this business and try all my favorite Viet dishes!!!!!"}
{"text":"I picked up several plates via takeout to share with my family and enjoyed everything; a combination bang mi, the special pho, and a#42 plate.  It was a cold Friday evening and all the dishes were tasty and hot the spot.  The flavors were good, and the veggies and herbs were just what the doctor ordered.  Fast friendly service!"}
