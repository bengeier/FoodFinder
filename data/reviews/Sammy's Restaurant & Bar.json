{"text":"This place is the worst if you want fast service. We been there 3 times and 3 times the service was super slow the first time we had to ask for a awaited and end up the manager took our order and took forever to get ketchup and mustard for our burgers.second time we had to wait again for a waiter to come around. Third time we wait about 5-7mins to be seated and left so if u want extra slow service go here we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Went basic today. Its a cold wet day so I had the tomato basil soup and a caesar.
Both were okay hard to mess up soup and salad.
Waitress was very funny."}
{"text":"The worst chips I ever had in any restaurant. I Ordered Sammy's chips and Guacamole, cost 10 bucks. they serve u the grocery bag chips! Cold and salty. So disappointing."}
{"text":"We were there for a Christmas Party which Sammy's really isn't set up for those kind of events but we make due. Some sat at the bar which to me is a better place to sit if you want to keep your glass filled whether it be alcohol or not.

I had the Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta and it had artichoke hearts, carrots, and zucchini squash which tasted really good. I had asked for some garlic bread but the closest they could come to was their cheesy bread which is more like a small 10 inch pizza, either way very tasty!

My friend had the Chicken Hummus wrap, I looked over and the plate was clean so I have to assume it was really good! ( I mean the plate even look licked clean!!!)

Marcus was our Bartender and was doing a good job of keeping up with the demanding crowd growing at the bar, plus the wait staff coming to get drinks as well, he was busy!!"}
{"text":"So nice great atmosphere as well staff friendly and the food wonderful the duck tacos so good and the bar tenders are great! Service fast. Recommend this one:)"}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:50 pm, we were promptly greeted at and sat by a young man wearing glasses. There were about 8 people at the bar, the bartender said hello as we walked to our table. There were 4 tables dining.  We were told Heather would be right with us. After perusing the dinner choices on the menu Heather arrived. She asked if we would like anything to drink. I had flipped my menu over and as I was deciding between the house chardonnay and the Clos du bois Heather apparently grew impatient. She said I'll get you some waters in a clipped tone. Not more than 45 seconds had transpired since she had arrived at the table. We said water would be great thank you. She arrived back with the waters and said she would come back if we hadn't decided on entrees. We then ordered the crab and artichoke dip. She did not ask if we wanted anything other than water. I felt as though she was judging us, our appearances, and our financial status.  When she came back from placing the appetizer order I ordered a wine and we placed our dinner order. The appetizer was tasty and we enjoyed it while mulling over what Heather's issue might be. While waiting for our entrees we heard a plate clatter to the floor in the direction of the kitchen. We joked that it was one of our dinners considering the amount of time that had passed. 5 or more minutes later Heather comes to tell us it would just be a few more minutes. Ten minutes later she tells us my sliders were burnt on the outside so the kitchen was remaking them.  I work in Hospitality as a Supervisor for a large corporation and have heard every excuse for a long ticket time there is. Blaming the kitchen is a servers go-to excuse. Once the food arrived we were for the most part satisfied with it, but still slightly put off by Heather's demeanor. She was not friendly, nor did she attempt to engage in any manner. We were one of her two tables she was serving at the time. We ate quickly and when she came to clear the plates she asked if we wanted dessert. At this point I had decided against dessert not because I didn't want have dessert but because I didn't wish to be Heather's guest any longer. She brought the check, I placed my card in the book and she offered mini doughnuts to go on the house. Too little too late. I'm not saying we will not dine again because the food was enjoyable once it arrived, I am simply hopeful that should we dine again we get a server that enjoys their job and puts customer service first. We left Heather a 16% tip which was generous considering her service."}
{"text":"The only reason this is not a 1-star review is because the food was actually good. The service, however, was terrible. We had a reservation for our large group of 12 but still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. The manager was rude and told us that a reservation was not a guarantee for seating. After we were finally seated, it took over an hour for our food to arrive. It's unfortunate that something as easy to provide as service was so blatantly ignored and that customers were treated as a burden. Get it together or you won't survive the Vegas local's service expectations."}
{"text":"I ate the entire pizza. The whole thing. To myself. Then I shamefully googled, \"best juice cleanses\" shortly after. The pizza is worth the guilt. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"I really like Sammy's and have been a loyal customer at all the locations around Vegas through the years but that being said the last 2 visits have been not so good. The service has really gotten bad and the food is not as good as it used to be. It took over 15 minutes before a waiter came to my table. He was swamped and was trying to wait on too many tables. I noticed they didn't have any busboys or extra staff to clean the tables. The tables around me still had dirty plates and glasses from previous diners who had left. I understand the waiters were to take orders, run the food and clean up. It's never a good idea to cut back on staff when the patrons are the ones who suffer. It's not a great way to promote your restaurant. My family of 4 had wanted a quick lunch which turned into very long experience. After waiting 15 minutes to be spoken to add another 15 till we got our drinks and then 30 minutes till we got our food, which by the way was not what we ordered. My husband's order was not correct and it took another 15 minutes till they brought out his correct order. The prices have increased every time I have returned and I'm not sure its worth the price anymore."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice.  The first time our service was poor, tonight it was worse.  It's a shame for such a nice location / atmosphere.  Our waiter was extremely poor.  Service was slow or not at all.  The restaurant had a nice crowd, but not busy.  With the amount of other restaurants in the local area, I can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service. Dawn always made sure we were taken care of. The eggs Benedict are the best I've had, banana walnut
Pancakes were amazing."}
{"text":"Yum yum and more yum. I think I over ate but sheesh it was so good! It was my first time and I got the Mediterranean plate and was super happy, soft hot flavorful pita bread. I also went carb crazy and ordered truffle fries. The crisp white glass of wine was a great suggestion made by the bar tender who was very warm and respectful. Everything I ordered was half off and $2 off any wine at happy hour woohooo =)

I can 't wait to go back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants over the past 15 years. Great food is an understatement. Service is great, which is the norm. Nice atmosphere. 

One curious thing though, I started to eat at the Green Valley Pkwy bar, and I have to say this, they have the most UNCOMFORTABLE bar chairs/stools a human can experience. Seriously, PAINFUL. Please look into getting something that doesn't pain your customers to sit in!"}
{"text":"Ask for Zack!  He takes care if business and makes you feel at home without kissing your ass.  Happy hour here is a must.  Half off appetizers, cheap drinks.  I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my gal in Henderson and she raved about this place. We went on 11/17/15 and sat at tables to the right (as you walk in the door) of the bar. The food was terrific and I would not hesitate to go there again for that reason.  The reason for the low star is our waitress. She was curt to the point of being rude.  My gal asked for the Orange-Horseradish sauce as an addition to her salmon, and the waitress say it's not horseradish sauce, it's Orange Marmalade. My gal asked her (very sweetly I might add) to check for her as it's delicious and she's had it before with the coconut shrimp.  The waitress brought her Orange Marmalade with no horseradish mixed in.  We went ahead and ate, then my gal asked for the menu and she, sweetly again, showed the waitress what she was talking about and the waitress said \"Well, we call it Orange Marmalade\" and walked off.  I wish I had my receipt for the gals name, but alas I don't.  When I come back we'll go there again, but I will refuse service from this rude brunette."}
{"text":"We were seated right away but waited for a waiter to take our drink order. There were only 5 tables and after 5 minutes someone came to take our order. She was in a hurry and acted as if we were not important. Looking out the window while we were talking and asking questions and started walking away in the middle of the conversation. Service is terrible."}
{"text":"No soy sauce. The hostesses that work here are the worst. Waited 30 minutes for a table. I was informed I had to wait another 20. I gave an extra star for our bartender, Travis."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with the staff! I work in this area and I refuse to come back here. There are other reataurants within the vicinity with far better food quality AND excellent staff."}
{"text":"We decided to go here one day after work because we had seen it pervious day and wanted to try it. Boy am i glad we stopped in and tried them. We got the asparagus scramble, loved it. It's a new twist and some everyday, i couldn't get enough. For being not a huge fan of asparagus i couldn't get enough. But thats not the best part. Their french toast with filling and orange was amazing. Ill definitely be going back for it. The manager, and waiter were very kind. Thank you for making a long day end amazing. We'll be back soon.."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the location and vibe of this place. I sat at the bar on the restaurant side and I believe our bar tender was Caitlin. She was very personable and tentative. We had some of the happy hour appetizers, which were delicious. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We dined for Brunch on Saturday, It WAS EXCELLENT! The dining room area was clean, well decorated and quiet so we could visit. Our server Alisia was funny, friendly, helpful and very attentive. The menu options for brunch were great: three different types of Eggs Benedict. The food arrived hot and beautifully presented. What a wonderful place for Brunch. Excellent Service, Food and Atmosphere! We will definitely be back.. Oh and Not To Pricey!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 7, 3 kids. I wish I could remember our server's name. She was awesome. I appreciated her accommodating our large and high maintenance party. We did lose her a little bit near the end when the restaurant got very busy...that's why the 4 stars.
We ordered a lot of food from tapas, pizza, and dessert menu. Our server offered suggestions from the menu. All were great tasting. We got a birthday sundae too. The cotton candy was spectacular and a big hit with the kids."}
{"text":"The worst service possible and if you love everything drenched in olive oil please order anything cause there is no shortage there! Waitress cared less for the plates stacking on my table! Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to never wanna come back and recommend the same for anyone who reads this or I know!"}
{"text":"Update/January 2017:

After I had written my letter in June 2015, I reluctantly hoped that the level of service would rise and match the pleasant dining atmosphere and the great food that Sammy's has to offer. Indeed, we had not frequented Sammy's for over a year, thinking that instituting some necessary changes would take some time. Several months ago, we decided to return and were very pleasantly surprised that the level of customer service had improved a great deal. But, after several satisfactory visits, we found yesterday that things at your Henderson location had really not changed at all.

Yesterday evening, Saturday at 5pm, we were promptly seated at our table by a very friendly hostess, who recited the standard line that \"a server will be with us right away.\" This section of the restaurant was empty when we arrived and we were seated very near the hostess's reception desk and in plain view for all to see. During the 15 minute wait time, we witnessed some very astonishing events.  First, the hostess, who had seated us, seated an elderly couple next to us. As she walked by, she had not noticed that we had not been greeted by any server. Second, the busboy who was preparing a table for 12-14 next to us, walked by twice to move chairs and a table needed for the larger group. He also had not noticed that no one had greeted us. Third, and most disappointing of all, the manager on duty would never have noticed us because she was very busy displaying her new manicure to the hostess. After 15 minutes of holding menus and not being offered a glass of water in an empty section of the restaurant, we concluded that no one cared whether we stayed or departed. So, we departed Sammy's, disappointed once again. Our departure triggered a reaction that was totally unexpected. The manager with the fresh manicure ran after us in the parking lot. Apparently, someone had alerted her that we had left and she confronted us, mumbling something about inviting us back in, and taking care of something..... By then, we had decided to eat elsewhere.

I need not remind you that we have very many dining choices in the area. Our favorites are Elephant Bar, Black Mountain Grill, Pin Kaow Thai, and Kabuki. Please direct your attention to Pin Kaow on Eastern Avenue, which we started visiting recently. Their customer service is outstanding. The hostess is constantly attentive to the dining customer's needs. You should take some lessons from her.

June 2015

Hello Mr Ladeki:
Hello Mr Anthony Kulick,
Hello Ms Joanna Train,

It is again very unfortunate that we were sadly subjected to a disappointing dining experience as a result of the mismanagement and lack of training of your service personnel. My email with similar concerns which I had sent last year was apparently ignored by your executive team as my family and I have noticed no discernible difference in the quality of your service. This is not to say that the wait staff is in any way rude or unfriendly. They are polite and cordial, but they are at a distinct disadvantage if they are not trained properly and therefore robbed of the opportunity to sell more product, generate more revenue, and earn more gratuities.

How can it be that on a Sunday around 5:15pm, when the Green Valley restaurant is at my best estimate one third full, when there are at least 8 or 9 servers all running in different directions including past our table MULTIPLE times, when there is one very clueless onsite manager running all around, and within the entire 15 minutes after being seated and reading menus, that NO ONE, NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON, can take responsibility and assume the duty and obligation to greet us at the table and assure us that our server will be with us shortly? Within those 15 minutes, NO ONE even asked us if we wanted water on a day where the temperature outside was 108 degrees!! I am sure that your very inattentive wait staff was very, very busy doing other things in preparation for the evening crowd, but this lack of a simple greeting is unacceptable.

I know 15 minutes is not a long time in the scheme of world events. But some patrons know what they want when they sit down. At the very least, they know what they would like to drink. Perhaps you should convert the restaurant into a self-serve establishment and eliminate the need for staff and a clueless onsite manager.

Please do not offer your phone number to \"discuss my concerns.\" I do not care to be offered any special treatment because I raise these issues. When I walk into a restaurant and have minimal expectations, I expect them to be met without having to write a long-winded Yelp post. Certainly I have better things to do with my time than to bring these deficiencies to your attention. 

We left Sammy's and wandered over to the Black Mountain Grill, where we were greeted by the server within 60 seconds of being seated. What a world of difference!

Perhaps you should visit Black Mountain Grill yourself and observe their operations."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and were extremely disappointed. The food was awful and the service was bad. We definitely won't be coming back when there are so many great brunch options in town. I'd give this one star, but they had a fairly nice garden, so I'm giving it two."}
{"text":"I hosted a birthday brunch for 16 people yesterday (Saturday), and the food, drink, staff, and management were all excellent.  They allowed me to build a menu myself and printed off a copy for each guest with pictures of entrees but no prices.  Manager Paras and Assistant manager Tia responded to my email questions promptly and helped my daughters set up centerpieces, providing them with a small table for a powerpoint presentation and a cupcake stand.  The food  arrived for all 16 of us at the same time and was still hot.  Everyone said his/her selection was excellent, from the grilled asparagus omelet to the eggs benedict to the lemon and fresh blueberry pancakes.  Our server Jess checked in on us frequently and refilled coffees and mimosas several times.  I was worried because the restaurant does not have a separate banquet room, but for most of the 3 hours we were there, only a few other tables were occupied.  They did not rush us at all.  Thank you all for making my celebration top notch."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Amazing food....great ambience....wicked good white sangria."}
{"text":"Tonight I had the grilled mahi tacos - yum!!! Delicious, grilled perfect and the chipotle sauce was way good!!! We come here often and the lobster bisque is another favorite along with the grilled veggie salad and duck tacos.  I also like the chicken lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I love the food, however the service is horrible! We waited 10 min for our drinks after being ordered...dirty dishes sat on our table for too long and we had to remind our server of drinks we had ordered so we could get them in before happy hour was over. I felt like the whole serving staff was weak, which normally reflects bad management..."}
{"text":"I hosted a birthday party at Sammy's last October and the manager and staff could not have been better.  They were attentive, kind, and helpful in every way.  I wish I could remember the manager's name because she really was the best.  Because of the excellent service and good food, I will always go back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Love the happy hour.

First time for lunch.  Julie I believe was her name was my serve with a gentleman named Rocky.  It was his first day training.  What a great tandem team.   Got to enjoy some conversation and look forward to returning with Rocky behind the bar or serving.

Local resident of Green Valley and GM of a high end steakhouse in Summerlin.  

After a week of work it's nice to go out and feel like a guest.  It feels even better when I can turn the work part of my brain off out dining because the service and food are both on point!

Thank you for the great lunch.  I look forward to returning"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had the most amazing salads at Sammy's..Awesome service, Ashley and Jenna, were so sweet and amazing!!!  Thanks for the great service and great food!!!  Keep up the great work, see ya soon!!!"}
{"text":"This place always has great food. Never fails. From bottomless mimosas to a casual beer and pizza night, this place has a friendly neighborhood vibe. There may be some wait staff that have a short attitude; let's be honest, it isn't easy serving in this town. Markus, the Monday through Friday bartender is truly genuine and probably helps makes the \"regulars\". He knows his drinks. It would be nice to see the menu change with the season. One last thought... Beware of the shishito peppers; although mild at times (still cooked to perfection) you may get a plate of hot ones! Luckily the amazing peanut based dipping sauce is close at hand to help relieve the mouth. On a side note, the sauce served with the shishito peppers is amazing for dipping their calamari, and pretty much any other vegetable."}
{"text":"I eat here quite a lot. I almost always get the hummus with pita bread. And my favorite entree is the tequila fettuccini dish. The pizza is also delicious, what ever they do to the bread is great!"}
{"text":"The service of a Restraunt is both it's face and backbone and this one has horrible complacent service... It took us an hour and a half to have a meal here on a Sunday night. We sat there for 30 mins before we had our drinks. Like previous posts, we noticed the manager standing near the bar watching football while his Restraunt was falling down around him. We saw several employees on the floor but \"they\" were clearly running the show, and poorly at that.

Steps of service were nonexistent. From start to finish the service was lacking on every level. Our server's section was clearly larger than she could handle, follow up was a joke, dirty dishes in front if us the whole meal, we wanted refills on our drinks but couldn't get them and the check took forever to come and God knows we couldn't wait to leave this place! 

Save yourself from a huge hassle and order Domino's..."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Amazing food customer service is great!!!  Salads, pizza what ever you choose is unbelievable!!! It's gorgeous inside been here over 2o times at least!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Sammy's in the Vegas Valley and this newest location was by far the best!

I dined at the Green Valley location for the first time with my husband on Friday. The restaurant was very busy but we did not have to wait too long for a table. The hostesses' attitudes felt abrasive and rushed. Our server was Anthony and boy were we lucky to have him. My husband being a smart-alec was firing out all sorts of questions about the menu and he answered them with ease. Anthony took us through the menu and highlighted some of the more popular items featured at Sammy's. 

We ordered the crab stack, the dipping sampler and chicken meatballs...YUM!! For dinner we had a HUGE kale salad and a Hawaiian pizza.

Our meal was timed perfectly and we received new plates and silverware before our dinner came out. Everything was spot on. My family and I will definitely return soon with our friends. Maybe even dare to try the messy sundae :)"}
{"text":"The combination of the chicken balsamic salad and the service will get me to come back for another visit (and it is two blocks away) the service was great I had my two kids and they were a handful and everyone was super helpful

Will update with more after round 2"}
{"text":"chicken salad was dry like the desert. service very slow. unhappy hour is what they should call their happy hour. first time eating here, last time eating here."}
{"text":"I wish I could give ZERO stars for my experience at sammy's today. I frequent this location at minimum once a week and I have never received such poor service as I did today. The lack of consideration I received while dining with my black friends was remenisant of Jim Crowe laws. I attempted to address a major concern to the manager opening the huge patio doors in front of my table to accommodate another guest when the   temperature outside was 62° and our party was literally freezing, only to be addressed in such a condescending manner by the assistant manager TAMERA. This was blatant discrimination and I will never bring any guest here again!!"}
{"text":"If you're gluten free, the menu is ripe with options. The service has been wonderful. Timely and attentive. They, also, accept reservations. The meals are on average $12 for dinner. I will be back."}
{"text":"We've lived in this neighborhood for two years and never even tried Sammy's.  It just looked like a local, quick gambling joint.  We were wrong.  We've now been there twice, and both times it was very good.  The first time we had the satay and calamari appetizers.  The chicken satay was cooked beautifully and was tender, but the best part of it was the peanut sauce.  We liked it so much we ordered a container of it to bring home.  The calamari was different than we've ever had.  It was more of a calamari meatball than regular fried calamari.  It was seasoned well and cooked well.  I really liked it, but my wife did not like the texture.  The second time we had the Asian appetizer which included potstickers, satay, and grilled shrimp, and they were all superb.  We also had the Thai salad and the NY pizza.  The chicken on the salad was tender and very good.  The pizza had great taste and was cooked evenly on the bottom, which is better than 99% of the other wood fired pizza places.  We also had one of the best servers we ever had.  Her name was Jess.  She was cheerful, prompt, and had great follow-up even though the restaurant was full and she was very busy.  She saw we hadn't received our food yet and checked on it without our asking.  We appreciated that she didn't give us a personal sob story to increase our tip.  We will certainly go back to Sammy's again."}
{"text":"I would give it 10 stars if I could. We are just visiting and tried it for the first time and got the duck tacos the New York pizza and the garlic bread. Every bit was perfect. It was the best taco I have eaten maybe ever. And the service was friendly and helpful we had Chris as our server . Awesome : ) Loved it : )"}
{"text":"Great food! Ive had sliders, tacos, chicken wings, salad, and everything is yummy. I never had anything I didn't like here. They have a small 24 hour gaming area separate from the restaurant, and 24 hour food service, which is convenient for my late night dealing schedule."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Friday night - Marcus was really fun and knew his stuff at the bar."}
{"text":"I like the employees, management is horrible. Owner get a clue! This guy must only know low end pizza, Sammy this is a bust and I blame you. I've gone to many Sammys, he must just be to old to get it, retire and save ur business. This place is horrible top to bottom.  If the owners name isint Sammy, whoever you are quit. I will never spend a quarter in this place again."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with my aunt and had the best service I think I have ever experienced there. The bar tender Micheal was so polite and very knowledgeable about the menu ! Tamra was very welcoming as well! Definitely will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for a while, and for good reason. Their duck tacos. That's it. They don't have to have anything else on the menu (although everything else is good too). I cannot go here and not order those. That's all."}
{"text":"When Sammy's initially opened at this location, my husband, granddaughter and I decided to try it out.  It was very noisy which made it very difficult to have a conversation.  In addition, the food was lackluster - nothing special. We gave it another shot last weekend and came away very disappointed.  My husband ordered the chicken Caesar salad.  The dressing wasn't blended well and the chicken tasted like they microwaved it. I had the balsamic grilled chicken salad.  It tasted like soap. We complained to the manager about the Caesar salad.  His response was that no other customer complained about it all night and we were the only ones unhappy.  After this reaction, complaining about my salad was moot.  They took off the Caesar salad from our bill, but it did little to make up for such a bad experience."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dining experience! Definitely recommend this place. Freshly made food, way more than a pizza place! Jonathan the GM is a delightful person"}
{"text":"Just had appetizers and the ahi poke, duck tacos and the chicken lettuce wrap were all fantastic!!  Great Hawaiian flavors, intentional or not, was spot on!!  Will be back!!

Ambiance was surprisingly bright, lots of windows, may try out their brunch!"}
{"text":"Hey Sammy's, don't put a coupon on the LVRJ if you're going to find every loophole not to honor it.  

Pros:  Fabulous decor and location.  Windows open, gorgeous!  Decent burgers.  Decent service (until the coupon issue arose).
Cons:  Coconut shrimp was below average.  Usually when I have a skewer I can \"fork it off the skewer\" and enjoy it.  This was so overcooked, everything was cooked/glued on to the skewer.  Very tough on the outside, didn't even resemble shrimp."}
{"text":"Had an incredible customer service experience this evening. Two to three servers tag teamed my table so all my needs were met in a timely manner. On top of that, when I went to order my salad, the server was honest and said some people did not care for the dressing because it is quite tangy and recommended I have it on the side. That turned out to be a great recommendation! I appreciate honesty and great service & will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hear it is short and sweet.   Good food, good servers and TERRIBLE hostess.  Little girls with NO clue what to do :(   Might go back if management gets rid of the CLUELESS half-wit girls."}
{"text":"Great remodel on both building and menu. Very impressed by both the food and the service. Was very busy but nevef had to wait long for anything. The nenu has a huge variety...perfect day or night.

Still make great pizza as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great local gaming bar. Friendly bartenders. I would recommend better signage on the back entrance to the gaming bar and two more TVs behind the bar. Otherwise a gray place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Yummy food, discounts at happy hour. plenty of parking, wide variety on menu. Lovely green garden is just outside and large sliding doors give the place an open feel. Very satisfied and will return before long."}
{"text":"I love the Happy Hour here. Great atmosphere. Great food. Great service. Will come back. Try their tapas, the pasta is better than others in our area."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who lives here originally and it was so delicious I brought my husband back from California to visit. We had Ricardo as our waiter and he was not only friendly and fun but the food is amazing here! We might even come back tomorrow night. Jonathan the manager is a doll and treated us with such great customer service. I cant imagine people not swarming here every night"}
{"text":"Amanda L was a great server! Made our Mother's Day dinner special. We were unexpectedly given a private table and she put the hockey game on per request. Thank you!"}
{"text":"AJ is a great server. This guy rolls with it. Thanks, dude, you're a good man. We had an excellent time. - those 5 ladies, you know who we are"}
{"text":"The Wagyu Cheeseburger is awesome and the Messy Sundae is a must. Service is great and they have an excellent cocktail menu. I definitely recommend this place after being here multiple times. It has become a new favorite."}
{"text":"Just found out that they don't serve breakfast anymore... ugh. What a let down! It was sooo good the first time. Wish they'd bring it back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to during happy hour. Even though the prices aren't THAT bad, it's just 10x better when paying the happy hour price!  One time at another location, we called and ordered and the let us dine-in while putting our order in with happy hour specials. That's awesome customer service!  The duck tacos are like nothing I've ever had before!  They are truly unique and definitely a must-try!  They are served mini on a bed of sour cream. They also have a tangy cream sauce inside. The coconut shrimp appetizer is also deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Live in Green Valley Ranch, and frequent Sammy's often. Was there tonight for a special occasion. because we have always had a wonderful time and great food.  Tonight - and as I can see from reviews on Yelp for the past five months that validates tonight's experience - service was an absolute disaster.  Appetizers took way too long to come out. When one if the managers came by to see how we were doing, I made a comment about the kitchen being backed up. He said she would find out what the delay was. Literally sixty seconds later, they came out... along with one entree. Sent that back and were told they would remake it and serve with the other entrees. Entrees came out - 4 of the 6 ordered. Ten minutes later the missing two finally came out after my husband complained to the manager.  Had to send one of the entrees back. These mishaps continued throughout the evening. Though the manager 'adjusted' our bill to compensate for all the mishaps, our semi-absentee waiter and all the other mistakes ruined the evening. And from recent reviews, these types of issues have been ongoing for months. No wonder, on a Saturday night, the place was half empty.  Please Sammy's - FIX THE PROBLEMS. We'll not be back until we see better reviews."}
{"text":"Well came in today with my girlfriend for the first time had their New York pizza with their own ingredients with chicken wings very good plate on both would recommend their pizza and chicken wings to anybody we will return."}
{"text":"Today was my daughters high school graduation and decided to have her celebration at this Sammy's since it's only a block away from my house. My husband and I have dined here often and knew it would be a good place to have a small gathering for the graduation dinner and I was so happy we did. 
Thank goodness for the manager Erin, she was very helpful in planning our menu, then when I can hang the graduation decorations, she volunteered to do it for me and everything else. She was a God send!!!
After the graduation we arrived for the gathering and the private room looked amazing and she already had salads, bread and waters all on the table. Plus she decorated the room and looked great. 
Then the food started to come out so delicious and the waitress we had, she was great too. The overall experience was fantastic!
Thank you Erin for making the celebration so seamless!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this place is! The restaurant's exterior is kind of plain but once you walk in you see right away that this is a fabulous place to meet friends or business colleagues for a nice meal or a drink. Check out their happy hour daily!! Very good service and great food too!"}
{"text":"Our server was horrible he opens up with \"y'all want anything to drink\" which I was like ok mannerisms are lacking for a place like this but ok. So we than place our drink orders. He than comes back after 12min exactly and tells me if he can help us. Which I said my wife still waiting on her tea. He brings the tea and I ask about my water. And place a order for hummus some guy not my waiter brings it out quickly enough. But my server took another 13min to come back and ask if we wanted anything to eat by this time I ask for the check. He than say \"oh wow so soon ok\" in a smart a$$ type of way. Brings my check with no pen I do not know of it was my skin color or what but seem like everyone else was getting quick servers.. I'll never take my business to that one the one on Shara is amazing and will now only go to that one!"}
{"text":"We ate at Sammy's for the first time Feb 13th. The food was tasty, and our server Albert was very helpful in selecting dishes to try. Looking at the restaurant from the outside, it looks like a typical dark bar/eatery, but what a nice surprise when you come inside. My only suggestion is that Sammy's should have rice as a side dish, it would have really complimented several of the menu \"shareables\"."}
{"text":"I'm hooked.

Occasionally the service is less than stellar, and people tend to bring young, loud kids here later than the usual \"young, loud kids\" hours for family restaurants.  But the food is both sensational and out-of-the-ordinary.

I've been four times, and each time I order two items off the appetizer menu, which is both extensive and diverse.  \"The Hot Rock\" (spoiler alert!) was a huge surprise, as it's actually a stone heated to an extreme temp and served with raw beef strips that you cut up and heat on the rock itself.  It was an amusing novelty, and it turned out to be really enjoyable, too!  Also enjoyed the crab-and-artichoke dip (even the pita bread is fantastic) and an amazing hot fudge and caramel sundae we got for free because we celebrating a birthday.  Can't rave about the Kobe chili or the chinese chicken salad, but I think it was just a matter of personal taste.

I'd certainly recommend going after 8 on a weeknight or even later on the weekend, but overall Sammy's serves some wonderful dishes and definitely offers something DIFFERENT from the usual fare."}
{"text":"We loved having Amanda L! She put the hockey game on for me and gave us a completely private table. Dinner came out perfect for all of us and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Alexxx is awesome! Literally the only reason I come here after work with my co workers! Always a good time with him behind the bar!"}
{"text":"Just got back. I had the grilled vegetable salad. It was small and didn't have enough dressing. The waitress didn't come back to see how everything was till we were done.  My friend had the grilled chicken. Nothing special. Kind if foo foo food. Not a big fan. Food was fair, service poor. Wont go back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place for years with my friends and family locally and from out of town.. this is my GO TOO place! Never had a bad experience. Their food just gets better and better every time I'm there, which I didn't know was possible.. LOVE this place, must try if you've never before! :)"}
{"text":"Sammy's is still stylin!

I've been back many times over the past few years and still enjoy it.  The location being right off of Green Valley and Pebble is easy to find.  The dining ambiance here is always great.  It's clean and has a welcoming feeling.  Service here can be hit and miss. For the most part they have been pretty friendly and attentive.  

I finally ordered one of their huge salads.  It was an absolute delight! The Balsamic Grilled Chicken is one that I'd order again. It's filled with mixed greens, Gorgonzola, walnuts, basil and tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.  Definitely filling!  The appetizers have been a let down. Im probably going to start skipping those to go right into the main meal.  Burgers, wraps and salmon have all been good.  

I'm happy that for the most part things have stayed on par since opening."}
{"text":"Ooh this place in the Green Valley hood is open 24/7! That was the first thing I noticed when I read the 411 about  the new Sammy's restaurant. Because when I have 3am cravings for duck tacos or I want a dessert for breakast(which is the very first thing I did on my official visit here http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sammys-restaurant-bar-and-grill-henderson?selected=nd2mtwNWS3VTUtSsgh3esw#6toCyEXOe6hYjLnFocaugw) I know very well where to go now!
  
Yes I have dined here 4 times already! Had fun trying out the Brie French toast during the mock breakfast. Had a blast when they hosted the Yelp Elite Event ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/elite-event-yelps-red-carpet-affair-sammys-henderson#hrid:n04td4eR6icK6Zxru0ZlCQ ) and been back twice now since they officially opened.  It's safe to say I'm a fan.
 
The standouts for me are their tapas and dessert offerings. The tapas menu is pretty unique and has an international flair.  There's Asian and Mediterranean cuisine thrown in as well...or should I say fused together..IE their Duck Tacos! Mini taco shells filled with shredded duck,creamy feta cheese and cilantro. They surprisingly pulled off the combo of ingredients. The Hot Rock is another tapas dish and must try. The beef is presented to you raw  marinated in ponzu sauce. You have to grill it yourself on a super HOT rock that is on top salt rock crystals which keeps the rock heated. I only wish they would give you a little more slices of beef for the amount you pay for this dish. 
 
For desserts, the Sticky Toffee Pudding is wicked good! Sweet moist cake served over a warm toffee sauce that eventually soaks thru. It's paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to balance the sweet stuff.  Yeah those evil sweets, so best have dessert in the morning so you have all day to burn those calories off! That doesn't help though I was back later for dinner and shared the Messy Sundae with Mr. B.  Caramel and Chocolate sauce, walnuts, whip cream all over the place ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sammys-restaurant-bar-and-grill-henderson?selected=nd2mtwNWS3VTUtSsgh3esw#l1e1s-4NV_6JNx6gDOgvHg) ..need I say more?
 
I also appreciate the focus is on healthy, fresh and organic, like the eggs for the omelet I had were cage free. Yummy Vegetarian, Vegan and Gluten free dishes are also served.  Adding their Baba Ghanoush to my #Meatless Monday rotation.


Atmosphere ..love it! Casual cool and inviting.  The livingroom-like dining area on the right side is the place to be! Its another huge factor that plays into this place for being one of the designated neighborhood places to dine. Its open and airy,  natural lighting during the day. Love the wicker furnishings it didn't feel cramped at all, the floor to ceiling glass were actually doors that slide open and voila!! It converts to a patio! When its not windy they have it opened up. I'm all about dining  al fresco!

The small negatives -  Breakfast was just okay. I did like what I had though. I think the price point for what you get is just a tad much. I'm guessing maybe because the demographic makeup of this area they mainly cater to can afford it. This place for sure is not your \"I come here to-get-my-daily -breakfast-burrito- place. Oh and steak and fries $25? That's a bit much too. Other than that, there's enough dishes well worth it. 
 
Service has been great! They are well staffed in all the areas. There was a little wait time to be seated but it was crowded at the entrance.  NOTE: They do take reservations and the manager I talked to also said OpenTable will be implemented soon.  So I highly advise you make reservations especially for dinner time hours.
  
Well those are the deets! I'm sure Ill have more foodporn pix pop up soon enough since you'll find me here often! Welcome to the neighborhood Sammys!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go today and as usual, food was fantastic. I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and Wagyu Burger which both had great flavor and totally hit the spot. John greeted me on the phone and took my order. He and I spoke about different selections on the menu. I was surprised at not only how well he knew the menu, but how he was able to suggest items based on the menu items I was ordering. It was nice to talk to someone about the many different dishes. It would take forever to try them all! He was friendly, hospitable and very willing to take care his customers. So Thanks for your help today John! Keep up the great work, we will be back. If you haven't been to Sammy's you are definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"A new Sammy's Restaurant in Henderson, relocated, remodeled and revamped!

The biggest difference is the location, though. The old Sammy's was hidden away on Sunset Rd, very hard to find. This new spot on Green Valley Pkwy is much more convenient and visible! 

Opening the menu, it looked familiar with the original items, plus a few new additions (or have I just overlooked them?) 

Vietnamese Crab Stack was refreshing, light, and very tasty. Presented so elegantly, my whole table enjoyed it. 

Off the happy hour menu, the Kobe Sliders had rave reviews from my boyfriend & his parents.

I've also enjoyed:
Mediterranean Dip Sampler
Hummus
Oak Roasted Asparagus
Lobster Mac & Cheese
Wok'd Sesame Shishito Peppers
Grilled Shrimp Salad
Salted Caramel Pudding

The food overall is pretty darn good. From their huge salad portions, unique tapas, Brie/truffle oil pizza w/ mushrooms (my favorite Sammy's pizza), or the ginormous Messy Sundae's overflowing goblet, there's many great dishes for every palate and appetite. Plus I ALWAYS appreciate any establishment that offers and labels vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options!

For me the best thing about this Sammy's is the interior set-up. I LOVE their patio area, where you can sit in plushy comfortable couches(with pillows!) which are part of their booths and look out the surrounding windows. It makes it airy, spacious, and welcoming. I can see me eating lunch there frequently if I worked nearby.

The prices are still pretty high, I always thought that. If ordering tapas, it's a shame if you don't go during happy hour, when selected items are half off. 

Service has been a hit or miss here. It seems the first visits, the staff were still getting used to their new operation, so their timeliness was off. It's gotten better though, our last dinner with our parents was awesome! We'll be come back to try their brunch..."}
{"text":"Happy hour.Live music. The mini duck tacos are sooooo  yummy. Happy Hour has great nosh options and prices for food. Drinks aren't  great prices for happy hour but they are delicious. The bartender is handsome and makes a great cocktail."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with the wife on Sunday evening.  Had the duck mini-tacos, sausage pizza and five cheese pizza with chicken and the flourless chocolate cake for desert.  The only thing holding this back from a 5 star rating was that the server did not pay us much attention, he was busy setting places on other tables and carrying stuff from one station to another.  Make no mistake though, everything coming out of that kitchen is delicious!"}
{"text":"Christy makes a refreshing Peartini and Garret makes a yummy raspberry martini. The restaurant is a clean, local place we like to swing by regularly. We get 10% off drinks and food for being LifeTime members. Oh, and I love the floating balls"}
{"text":"I'm so particular with most things... but the mini duck tacos, messy sundae, lobster bisque & pizzas always seem to do hit the spot!!!  I could honestly say I've probably had all of their pizzas... And not once have I been disappointed ( my favorite being the thin crust margarita pie )  so go! Enjoy yourselves!"}
{"text":"We've been to Sammy's a bunch of times and always have had a good experience. The restaurant is laid out in 3 very separate areas. The gaming partition is completely separate with a separate entrance (only a shared bathroom). On entering the main restaurant, to the left is a more traditional dining area. To the right is an airier, more casual dining area, with some couches and some tables, with lots more light. We've come for HH and had the chicken lettuce cups (excellent!!), baba ghanoush, hummus, and dip sampler. Not disappointed with any of them. The pizza is thin crust. Quite good. This last visit I had the shrimp angel hair pasta. It has roasted mushrooms and artichoke. I asked for light lobster cream sauce - they made it perfectly. And as usual, service was excellent."}
{"text":"Love the decor and love going here for happy hour. Lots of great little plates to snack on over a glass of wine. The pizza is delicious as well. The service is either exceptionally great, or just okay. Depends on the server. Bonus is enjoying a beautiful day there when they have the sliding windows open."}
{"text":"My sister and I were starving and wanted dinner. 

We pulled up to Sammy's, with about an hour and a half before closing. The restaurant was empty, and we were bounced between a bidder and a server. Neither introduced themselves, so I don't have names. 

The busser gave us an incomplete drink order. I had to ask two other people for them to finally complete it. When our waiter came by, I asked what he recommended on the drink menu. His answer was that he had just transferred to this location , and he couldn't recommend a drink. .....aren't all Sammy's some what the same? 

After our orders were taken, no one really checked on us. And when they did, they wouldn't clear our plates/ glasses. My sister at one point had three glasses of coke, just piling up. 

For an empty restaurant, I really don't understand. Service was terrible!"}
{"text":"$28 for an 8oz charred steak ordered medium brought out well done, zero sauce option.One forgetful server trying to take care of the whole dining room, not the place you want to go for a steak BUT the fries were good."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here, Marcus was our bartender. So friendly and nice to talk to. My shrimp salad was awesome large and delicious I ate every piece of it. I was recommended here by one of my guest at Kings fish house and I'm very happy I came. I heard they have a great happy hour. Bar stools where very comfy. :-) Mike next door was very friendly too."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's very cozy and it feels good to be there. During warmer times of the year it looks like they open up all the sliding glass windows. Seems like it would create a really cool indoor/outdoor vibe. Would be a lovely spot for Sunday brunch. (AHEM: bottomless mimosas)

Service was great. Food came out relatively quickly (not TOO quickly, that freaks me out), water glasses were never empty, and the server gave great recommendations and was very friendly. 

Food was okay. Nothing, out of this world amazing, but still tasty. The menu is very broad, one of those we have a little of everything places. Maybe spreading themselves a little thinly and thats why nothing is absolutely stunning. However I would come back here. Good place to go when you have a large group of picky and/or not adventurous people."}
{"text":"Great food, lots of variety, great health conscious choices, vegan and gluten free options. Friendly staff and management coupled in a beautiful location. Also,  full menu in 24 hour gaming bar and 2 happy hours all week long, 3-6 & 10 -4. Half priced tapas all the way.  Mm mm duck tacos."}
{"text":"Great place to have food and drinks, staff is friendly and service is fast. We've been there several times and will continue to go back. Try it out Vegas"}
{"text":"We have been going to this Sammy's location for the past few years and we have never experienced horrible service or food until last night 6/21/18. We got there at 8pm there were ONLY three other tables there and our service  was horribly slow. Took 15 minutes to get three drinks and 40 to get our food and it was cold when it was delivered. Sliders, chili and tacos. I couldn't believe it!!! I  walked to the restroom and the cooks were just standing around waiting for something to do so why did it take so long and have it be cold on top of it!! Pay attention to your customers !!"}
{"text":"Returned a few months ago for a birthday.

Wonderful pear pizza. Good service even though the they were training a newbie server.

The Old Fashion drink was close to expected. The comp birthday treat was really good. The ice cream came in a wine glass dripping in caramel and chocolate sauce. Very unique since the sauce held the glass to the serving plate as well as lined the inside of the glass and was layered over the ice cream.

Yes indeed, will return.

I saw some recent one and two star reviews concerning poor service. Hopefully those situations are major flukes otherwise I'd go somewhere else too."}
{"text":"Great food, Great service! Some must tries:
Hot Rock. So cool, you get to cook NY Strip how you like it on a hot rock.
Lobster Bisque. 
Spicy Italian Sausage Pizza. My Favorite!
Chinese Chicken Salad.
Spicy Chicken Angel Hair Pasta. Never disappoints.
Wagyu Cheeseburger.
Everything is great and the staff will make sure you have a great time!"}
{"text":"This location is in a sorta strange spot as it's part of a business complex. But it's decorated nicely and has a good ambiance. It has both the normal restaurant area, as well as a 24/7 tavern, gaming area. Service is attentive and friendly in both areas. And hey, I hit 4-of-a-kind twice here, so that's pretty awesome. Happy hour is 4-6pm and has multiple small appetizers and drinks on special. The apps are smaller portions than the regular apps, so you aren't exactly saving a bunch of money. But it is nice in that it allows you to try out multiple apps, as opposed to getting full on just one. All of the food I've had here has been great. I love their goat cheese pizza. And the mac 'n' cheese is fab. I wish they still had the kobe beef hummus, but the regular hummus is still tasty. The meatballs are pretty good too. All in all, this is a great place to play, dine, and do happy hour."}
{"text":"Never had anything I didn't love. Their pizzas are all delish. Marcus works at the bar and always takes care of us"}
{"text":"The second time I went here- they missed a topping on the pizza so they put topping on pizza and refired it- which is a no no- great way to give someone food poisoning . and service was terrible.

We decided to try again- since the first time was not bad.  It took 10 minutes to get seated for lunch and then we waited with three children another ten minutes and never saw a server - 

so we left and will not be back"}
{"text":"I will give 2 stars because of the desert was good! Service was horrible, salad looked old and didn't taste fresh, pizza was okay! I am not planning on coming back."}
{"text":"Zach is an excellent server. Makes sure you get the best deal for your buck and makes sure your drinks are never empty. Food was great!!"}
{"text":"Have not had service this exceptional in a long time. Albert was my server and extremely attentive and helpful even when the place was slammed. The greeting from the front door to the goodbye when we left this place is the epitome of hospitality."}
{"text":"Gotta say, I didn't know what to expect with this being tucked away in a business park but it was probably the best meal we had in Vegas all week (Giada's was pretty good too). 

Decor and Vibe

This was a very cool \"mature\" version of Sammy's which I am used to living in California. They had these great open windows that actually slide open to open up to the outside so the entire restaurant became almost a patio. Beautiful decor, with very cool fire pits for groups. 

Food

Loved how many healthy options were on the menu. My wife is super picky and gluten free. We shared a Mediterranean plate, a balsamic chicken salad and Mahi Tacos.. all around deliciousness.  

Service 

The server was very helpful and gave us great information for their $10 lunch special that we couldn't do because we were there later than the timeframe, but it sounded great.

Parting Thoughts

This is a great spot to bring a business meeting, an event, a date.. definitely sophisticated and affordable. Wish they had one of these in San Diego!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years and despite one poor experience, this place is great!  The food is always on point, the decor is chic and inviting, the staff is attentive, and it is close to me which is always a plus!  This time in particular I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and it was fantastic!  I will definitely be furrowing my brow the next time I'm here as I decide what to order besides this.  Possibly the Thai Chicken salad, a pizza, some pasta??  I want to try it all!"}
{"text":"The food and service were good. Love the atmosphere! The outside sign has you thinking this is just like a bar food type of place with gaming but when you walk in you will be pleasantly surprised with the decor and service. Very nice menu options, a little pricey for lunch though."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place!  Every time I come, the food is tasty, the ambiance is excellent, and most of all the service is top-notch!!  It's one of the few places that I frequent alone because it is THAT good. Try the duck tacos and alllll of the pizzas!"}
{"text":"The half priced apps at happy hour are the best.3pm-6pm. Chicken skewers with Thai peanut sauce-awesome. Duck tacos-awesome. Pot stickers rock. Pizza rocks. This place has always been a favorite and its close by. Staff us nice and always use upbeat. I would strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food terrible service. Our waiter ignored us then made it clear he was irked by our presence. Some other waitress stepped in to get our order started.  Maybe it's a shift change or something but a little unexpected here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is always fresh, the staff is courteous and wether I am at the main bar or the gaming bar the tenders are always personable. The happy hour is one of the best in town! 4-6 50% off all their shareable tapas! Then Ahi Poke is my favorite thing on the menu... besides the buratta and pesto pizza."}
{"text":"My family and I went there for my birthday. I have very high expectations seeing it's my birthday dinner. I choose to give them my money which will never happen again. It took 20 minutes for someone to take our order, I never knew my servers name, when the order was taken 2 entrees were not entered into the system.  Dressing was not brought and forgotten about. The chopped salad was the worst salad ever. No server came and asked if everything is ok. So here's my advice.... Do not give a server a busy station, servers need to communicate with customers as people because last time I check I was a person and I can be talked to about anything. The manager was absolutely amazing and I thank him for that but no service recovery helped us. Please retrain your servers. The customers deserve that for giving you their money and are there for a positive experience so they will be repeat customers. I hope this changes because it's just another checked off place that I will never go to."}
{"text":"2nd time here in the last month. The food has nice flavors but the pizzas are a little light on toppings. I ordered a Hawaiian, it only had 1 piece of ham & 2 pieces of pineapple per slice that is not much for a $13 pie. The service is also quite lacking"}
{"text":"So we decided to give Sammy's another shot after being invited back by the GM. SO glad we did!! The service was much improved this time around, we saw much more of our server, Alex, than we did of our server during our last visit. We had the dumplings (finally!) as well as their calamari, both of which were awesome. We also enjoyed their flourless chocolate cake. Some of the menu descriptions don't do this delicious food justice. We were thoroughly impressed not only by the display of exceptional management but also the fantastic server we had who not only made suggestions but also ensured our glasses were never empty and our plates didn't sit for too long. I hope this was not a fluke and I truly hope that Sammy's is striving to improve their customer service. As for us, we will certainly be back and recommend to friends in the GV area. I hope next time around the service and food are just as consistent. Thank you Sammy's staff for restoring my faith in the customer service industry!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great environment with live music. We got the pizza and garlic knots. Waiters were friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Sammy's has potential but the quality and consistency of both food and service need improvement for it to realize its potential.  One thing I did like is it clearly is a place that welcomes those of alternative lifestyles - very open minded.  Hopefully they can address their growing pains and put things in proper order.  Let the good times roll!!!"}
{"text":"Slow service at lunch however the pizza and the salads were worth the wait. I believe they're a little understaffed but worth the trip there"}
{"text":"Love love love this place, it's awesome.  The bartenders are Great and super friendly.  I'm working my way through the specialities and have yet to be disappointed!  I'm thankful to have found this cozy hideout just a week after I moved here from CA."}
{"text":"The service was so bad that we finally left. We got in there and the hostess was friendly and seated us but after that our server completely ignored us for so long that we finally got up and left. The restaurant was hardly full and the waitress seemed more concerned with flirting with the bar tender than she did serving the customers."}
{"text":"we waited quite a while just to be seated. No one was at the desk to help. We finally got seated and it was very very noisy.

We ordered a pizza that definitely was not what it used to be. we were glad when we had finally finished our meal and got out. We were very disappointed as we have always enjoyed Sammy's before this."}
{"text":"I have now dined at this Sammy's location 7 times now and each time it gets a little better.  Considering that I live about 3 minutes away, it is very pleasing to have another close by dining option.

I have enjoyed breakfast 3 times and dinner 4 times at this location.  I probably would have given it 5 stars if it had a slightly better selection on the menu...but of course YMMV depending on what you like.  

All of my breakfasts there were very good, but a little expensive.  Dinners were also very good and a good value.  I've enjoyed pasta dishes, pizza and dinner salads...and would not hesitate to reorder any of them again.

One thing I do note is that this Sammy's is WAY better than the other Green Valley location that is now closed.  That one had me completely turned off to the place and I planned on never going back.

One other notable thing is that the environment is very appealing here, especially when they open up the sliding glass walls when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Honestly, a restaurant is as good as it's staff and it's food.  Sammy's on Green Valley Parkway hits the mark on every criteria!  I have been going there for .... well, since it opened at this location.  Over the years I've gotten to know the whole staff and it's like Cheers, you know?  \"Where everybody knows your name!\"  Erin has gathered an epic staff that make the place run like well-oiled machinery.  You can tell the employees enjoy working there and they always make me feel welcome.  The menu is varied enough that you never get bored and all the items are well prepared and of the highest quality.  Behind the bar we have Chris, Aubrey, Caitlyn, Jenna and Brandon who are always super friendly and efficient.  Between the management staff Erin has Ashley and Justia taking care of all the details and while effortlessly making it all happen, they never forget that it SHOULD BE FUN!!  And it is, and that's why we always go back again and again.  Great staff, excellent food, convenient location.  Thanks for having us.  We appreciate your amazing service and food.  Thank You!!"}
{"text":"Do I love this place? No.
Is it a great atmosphere for friends, family, drinks, and decent food? Yes.
There is nothing above and beyond about Sammy's, except maybe the great service. Every time I have ever dined here, I am pretty blown away by the attentiveness of the staff. 
I also really love the ambiance. You can sit at the bar and watch the game, dine at a normal booth or table, or in nicer temps, they have opening glass doors to a beautiful garden area. If you sit on that side, the booths are more like couches. Perfect for a larger group, or family dinner. 
There are a few menu items that stand out to me. The mini duck tacos, the lobster mac & cheese, and as small as it may seem, the freakin' cheesy garlic bread is pretty bomb. The salads are huge, and the pizza is decent. 
Plenty of selections, including unique options like lamb, and meat cooked on a hot stone right at the table. 
All of the desserts are to die for. Even the huge plate of cotton candy that is enough sugar for 10 kids! 
I will continue to dine here, but it will never be my first choice. Unless it's for cocktails. Great selection.
Props to the entire staff for being awesome."}
{"text":"Both Leo and Jamie on the tavern side were amazing! I met a client at Sammy's and both gentlemen were great. Professional and attentive and they both made us feel at home! I will continue to bring clients so long as they make my clients feel at home. Great staff. Great service."}
{"text":"We had always heard that Sammy's food was so good and couldn't wait to try it.  So on Friday night, we placed an order to go.

We ordered a 5 cheese pizza and were completely disappointed.  I should have known that it wasn't going to be good as when I picked up the box, I had to check to see that there was a pizza in there as it was so light.  The pizza tasted like something you'd get at Cici's or a low chain buffet.  Completely disappointed.

We also ordered the Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad and this was ok.  The chicken was a bit burnt and dry.

We also ordered some Pork Dumplings and they were probably the best thing we ordered.

As for the service, there was some confusion on how to pay for a to-go order when I went to pick it up . . . they were nice enough about it, but just seemed like they still haven't gotten the flow of a new restaurant yet.

I looked at the other reviews and just didn't have the same experience as others had.  Maybe it was an off night . . . maybe the food doesn't hold up when you take it to go.  Maybe we need to dine in and see what we think before completely writing off this restaurant. 

I do know this . . . . If I want to order Pizza to go, I would much rather get it from Metro Pizza.  Hands down!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here. I went a couple of days ago with 2 friends and we shared the baba ganoush which was SO GOOD! The pita bread with it is incredibly flavorful and wow I could live on it. My Peartini was awesome, although I don't like the $14 price tag that comes with it. I had the mahi tacos w/ French fries which were good. The ambience is nice and the service was pretty good. I would go back and definitely get the baba ganoush and Peartini again."}
{"text":"Three of us went there. Pizza was pretty good. Salad was good. Two of us ordered alcoholic beverages. We all requested water. The waiter brought us a carafe of water that had no ice. The water was warm. It tasted like it was unfiltered water right out of a garden hose. Undrinkable. If this is their attempt to force restaurant-goers to all order a drink, then I'm not falling for it. I hope I never go there again."}
{"text":"Horrible. Do not go!  Food was horrible. Service sucked!  Waited 15 min to get seated with the restaurant being empty. They had three hostess and they were all confused. Then seated and ordered and when out food came everything was cold. I don't go to restaurants to get served cold food. After I told them they did apologize and comp our meal but just disappointing for a family Sunday dinner"}
{"text":"The food is sooo yummy with lots of great choices! Raychelle was our server and she was amazing!! Sooo friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is chill and comfortable. This is definitely a place to enjoy with your friends, family or just by yourself  we will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great staple in our family's favorite places to dine. Friendly staff, quick service, and consistently good food. Variety of options on the kids menu and delicious gluten free crust for those who want/new that option. My husband's favorite topping is their Italian sausage."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! A must try if your around Green Valley Parkway and Pebble area. Bbq Gouda chicken pizza and toffee pudding was delish!! The hot stone steak appetizer is also a must try. They brew a really refreshing passion iced tea as well."}
{"text":"My family of four went last Friday night around 7 pm. We worried because this is  usually a very busy time, and they were very busy, but we only waited about 10 minutes outside, which was not bad at all. However, there is no place to wait inside, especially on a busy night and they need to hand out buzzers so the hostess doesn't have to come out and yell names aloud. Luckily it wasn't cold outside, so waiting was not bad at all. I'm sure they will eventually get the buzzers. 

Our server was very personable and gave good service. Our tapas appetizer of three different hummus dips with some sort of warm yummy pita bread was so good. It was perfect if you're just ordering a salad as your entrée, because that's what I did and I was totally stuffed. 

My daughters loved their dinners too: BBQ chicken with potatoes and cheeseburgers sliders with fries. I did wish they had something green on the side with the kids meals like broccoli or spinach, but the quality of the food was very good.  I would say the quality of these kids meals compared to other restaurants is better for sure. 

I had my favorite balsamic salad with chicken. I've always loved this salad, but Sammy's needs to not drench it so much in the balsamic dressing. It was very good, but overly coated in dressing.  

Husband had fish tacos which he said were very good. 

For desert, we had the most delicious mini donuts with raspberry and chocolate dipping sauce. They were so good, they reminded me of churros. It was just perfect amount of sweet for four people. We loved it!

The ambiance was nice because it's fancy, but not so fancy that we didn't feel weird bringing our kids on a Friday night. We saw several other families with kids in our section, so that was good. You can tell they try to sit families near each other and the on a date and just adults in a separate section. Which is good for everyone because then the people with kids don't feel bad if they get too noisy with the people that are there without kids. 

Of course, bringing kids we had to make 3 trips to the restrooms, which were small, but also very nice. Clean and pretty stone all the way up to the ceiling. 

We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Walk in, the young man greets us pleasantly as the woman with dark colored hair sweeping the floor- looks at her watch in a rude manner and makes a sound like we are cramping her style as the nice young man offers to seat us. 
The last tine we came to Sami's the same female was rude- same thing is happening... WHY DO WORK IN SERVICE IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN SERVICE?

Now it's the end of the meal- she became nice in a forced manner. 
Keaton was amazingly friendly. YHE FOOD IS ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY YUMMY!!!
The service is always touch and go, bummer. Samies, is it possible for service and food to match in quality?"}
{"text":"This was our second time eating here and the service was awful. Took an hour to get any food, which was simultaneously the appetizer and an entree for me (not what I ordered, surprise!) then brought my wife's cold food 10 minutes later. Cold salmon is not good. Waitress didn't seem to mind at all. The one good thing she did was take the salmon off our bill. After paying we went to get food somewhere else. Too bad because our first trip was great."}
{"text":"Awesome food but the restaurant is almost too fancy now. I don't like the new seating, I felt too low in reference to the table and I felt uncomfortable the entire time. 
The appetizer fries are really good and of course the pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"The menu doesn't have much of a selection, food was pretty basic. The service was very slow, our waitress was also the bartender. Refills took too long might as well get it yourself. Not planning on returning."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. The pizza is spectacular. They serve out of the box recipes, so if you're feeling adventurous for a new restaurant, this is the place to go. The decor is also nice and cozy. 

The only downside is how loud it is. The kitchen is not closed off so that creates a lot of background noise and the restaurant doesn't have sectioned walls for seating so noise is traveling throughout. I had to yell at my boyfriend even though he was right in front of me. Kind of ruined the moment. 

I would just order for pick up if you want it to be intimate or want to be able to have a conversation with the person you are with."}
{"text":"Well anything that replaces an Applebee's is already a plus in my book. I like Sammy's Pizza, it's usually convenient when I meeting my friends who live across town or meeting friends with kids, as I find them very kid friendly. I've visited the Arroyo Crossing & the W. Sahara location multiple times and it is never a disappointment. I love their Pear & Gorgonzola pizza along with the others, BBQ, Margarita. My favorite app is the Duck Tacos (not to be confused with the duck quesadilla, not a fan). And who doesn't love the Messy Sundae? 

This location is great, huge open floor plan, bar right in the middle, but my favorite thing about this location is the wall facing Green Valley Pkwy opens up and exposes the entire restaurant to fresh air. I love it! This is definitely a great addition to the GV area. Can't wait to come and try brunch. This place is pretty decent when it comes to chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice place for lunch on a Saturday (or any other day), Sammy's is a great choice!  They have a good assortment to choose from - pizza, soups, salads, pastas, a good assortment of finger foods and deserts.  They also have a kids menu.

This location is always clean and the staff is always friendly and courteous.  There is plenty of parking behind he building.

We started off with garlic cheese bread.  Like a cheese and garlic pizza without the sauce.

An Asian sampler - skewers of grilled shrimp, a couple pot stickers with dipping sauce, and a couple skewers of satay chicken in a peanut sauce.

Followed by a mozzarella cheese and pepperoni pizza.

Ended with a Messy Sunday!

We were luck enough to get Raychelle as our server, so was had a great time!  Definitely a place to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is far above the average local restaurant and bar, it's fantastic. It's very clean here and the environment is lively, full of light (there are beautiful windows) and class. If you are looking for somewhere to take a date, or take your family for a birthday (including kids) this is a classy yet down-to-earth diner. You need to check them out and oh yeah - the waitress Taylor is GREAT! :) She was attentive yet did not interrupt our conversation she made her presence known but let our conversation continue with out the usual server interruption \"how is everything\" .....I hate that..... I really appreciated Taylor and her professionalism. She was the cherry on top of a great meal and great conversation between me and my friend. Thanks Sammy's! We will be back :) esp for those tiny burgers OMG they are so good!! This is from their website and I could not agree more: \"A stylish setting and innovative menu come together at our newest Sammy's restaurant at the corner of Green Valley Pkwy & Pebble Rd. Also featuring 24-hour gaming and events all month long!\" -- ps go during happy hour 4-6 PM everyday and appetizers are a full serving and 1/2 price :) what a deal .."}
{"text":"FIRST time there after an early OT shift and nieces soccer game and would you know I found the place to throw my youngest grad brunch..service was great and food is amazing! Love the whole floor plan and booths were SO comfy I almost fell asleep. The only request would be to play some soft music to keep the vibe going:)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Great food, and the staff is incredible!!!  Mandy is hands down the best bartender ever!!  Highly recommend to all!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the shisito peppers...organic kale salad  would definitely get again."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience tonight and we owe a huge thank you to Jewels!  She didn't rush us, was very personable, and was an amazing waitress. After eating here 4 different times I have to say I'll come again, BUT make sure Jewels is working! BTW if her name is Jules sorry for the misspelling in the earlier sentences."}
{"text":"The restaurant is good but the 24 hour bar is my favorite hangout. Jamie the bartender is personable  and always upbeat. He remembers what you drink when you come back. Definitely a locals gem. The food is good. Machines are a bit tight but we go back because of Jamie."}
{"text":"For years we come here for family gatherings over lunch. What to get here: oak roasted salmon, wild arugula salad, crisp Brussel sprouts, hummus and herb flatbread, coconut shrimp and the waygu beef sliders...there's truly something for everyone."}
{"text":"Dec 24th dropped in for a beer and a snack, which I was directed to the lounge as the restaurant had just closed. Ten people at the bar with bar tender chatting away at one end. Five minutes and I am still waiting for at least an acknowledgment. Very poor service. Had to walk away and find a better place to relax."}
{"text":"My Experience:
My friend's step-mom recommended this place. Had dinner here on 12/20 with my friends. I was already impressed as soon as we were seated because they sat us at one of the best tables they had. The hostess sat us at the corner table that had a huge comfy couch. Our table was really nice because we had a view of the street and it was super super comfortable. Our server's name was Anthony (I think). We had wine questions and he was very helpful. After our drinks came we decided to start on their Mediterranean Dip Sampler and they were really amazing! My friends and I ordered own entrées and we were not disappointed at all with what we ordered. Then, as soon as we finished our meal and started talking about dessert our server placed a huge complimentary sundae on our table. The Messy Sundae is a must have because it's like being a little kid again. The sundae was a tall plastic wine glass that had vanilla ice cream in it with caramel and chocolate all over the whole thing topped with whipped cream. It was sooooooo good! 
My overall opinion:
I really like the ambiance of this place. Their furnitures are comfortable. I have no complaints at all about the service our server did a very good job. Their menu looks great. The price range is pretty reasonable. They have a decent wine and beer selections. For a place that opened just a few months ago, I think they are doing a pretty good job. :)"}
{"text":"Have eaten at other Sammy's locations many times over the years in Las Vegas and Henderson - but my visit to this location will serve as my last visit to Sammy's.  Service was just awful (tapas and first courses served after entrees were brought out - not sure if this was an issue with the kitchen or the waitstaff), food was unremarkable at best, management was not on top of anything and made no effort to address any issues, charges were on the bill for upcharges not disclosed on the menu, one item came to the table with an ingredient incorporated in the item that requested to not be in the item, that the server verified would be left out of the dish (guess they are not concerned about or attentive to guest requests for preferences, potential food allergies, other items).  Way too many lapses in service, poor quality of food and lack of management oversight.  Never again, just terrible..."}
{"text":"Great hummus and balsamic salad! Will be back! Great local spot...right down the street. Love sitting at the bar or dining room. Service is always friendly and timely. Love the decor with comfy booths and the big windows are awesome."}
{"text":"Loved it when it first opened. Last couple of times it seems as though they either sold it or did a HUGE cost cutting. Portions are smaller. Bottomless mimosas were 90% orange juice. Not cool."}
{"text":"BEST SERVICE AND FOOD EVER!!
 Erick has been our food server several times and he is spot on! Our drinks were never empty and the food was AMAZING!! The manager (Len) was very attentive to all customers, which is a plus.... shows he cares about his restaurant and the quality of service and food his team is serving.. I highly recommend this Sammy's.. if you're
looking for Great customer service and Excellent Food this is the place!"}
{"text":"I went here because I was invited as part of a networking group.  We had the wine tasting dinner, and Clos du Bois was the sponsor.

The food was decent and I liked the wine pairings.  I just felt the chicken was a little dry and same with the beef.  I don't know if it's because of the wine pairing dinner that the food was that way; maybe they were mass producing things since it was busy.  I find chicken breast dry in nature, but this one was particularly dry.

Service was very good though, I must say!

I liked the atmosphere (I would probably love it if I were single....nice bar!) and might be back if I'm in Henderson, which is rare."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed sitting inside this restaurant during my lunch break from work. I love all of the windows and natural light that brightens up the dining area. Even though it was chilly due to the AC, I loved how clean and modern the restaurant is now. I also heard that when it is nice outside they open up the sliding doors which would be wonderful!

I went to Sammy's for a work lunch break. One friend got the BBQ woodfired pizza, another got the Kobe burger, another person got the sliders, someone who has come to Sammy's often got the duck tacos, and I got the Balsamic Chicken Salad that was gluten free friendly. 

My salad was way overdressed. Painfully overdressed to be honest. The chicken was a little dry too. However, it was still a little enjoyable, but I was sad I didn't get the shrimp salad or the Kobe Beef Chili which were also gluten free friendly. 

My buddy said the duck tacos are always good, never too greasy, and he ate them all! One of the best things on the menu! The BBQ pizza looked good, supposedly tasted pretty good, but not going to lie, he said he has had better pizza nearby. It was a nice portion though and smelled delicious!

The sliders got a thumbs up, but he said to go with truffle fries since the basic fries are just that. Basic. The Kobe burger was delicious (per my fellow employee) and juicy. Good sized portions without being obnoxious. 

Overall, the experience was good. I won't be running back to come here immediately, but I will come back to try other items on the menu. One of the guys in our party say he's never been disappointed, so I'll give it another go! Plenty of gluten free and vegetarian options which is great! 

I'd say worth a try!"}
{"text":"The food is a combination of contemporary American, international inspired dishes and pizza. I really love the decor of this place. It's modern yet comfy and I love the second time I went when there was live music playing and they opened up the modern glass walls to let the beautiful weather in (mind you, it was spring). Service both times was great, and had friendly staff. They also offer gluten free and vegetarian options and a good sized wine list. They are also open 24 hours for gaming.

Chicken lettuce cups $10.50- I definitely recommend these! Soo delicious, some of the best lettuce cups I've had. The black bean hoisin sauce is really good.

Chicken tequila fettucine $16.50- big portion, flavorful and tangy, made with spinach fettucine 

Oak roasted chicken breasts $16.50- light but you could really taste the oak in the chicken breasts. Basil pesto and pine nuts give it a nice touch.

Spicy Thai Grilled Chicken Salad $12- huge salad, very typical Thai flavor with julienned veggies 

5 Cheese Woodfired Pizza + pineapple & pepperoni $11.75 (+ toppings) - large, definitely sharable for two people, thin crust. I like that they had pineapple rings instead of just little pieces

Messy Sundae $10- Ack!!  This is absolutely horrible lol, all for looks, not good at all! I'm not exaggerating when I say that I think they squeezed half a bottle of Hershey's syrup in a wine glass and put one baby scoop of vanilla ice cream hiding inside. It was bad. And just topped it with a ridiculous amount of whipped cream.

Flourless chocolate cake $10- This on the other hand was nothing short of amazing lol comes with coconut sorbet and raspberry sauce. Seriously tastes like eating a box of raspberry truffles. Yum! 

I will definitely be back soon!!! :)"}
{"text":"Gave it a whirl. 
Really like the indoor yet outdoor feeling of the \"patio\" dining area.
I love their patio dining atmosphere... open, airy and just all around fun... like being in someone's solarium.  The groupings of tables and \"booths\" which are overstuffed chairs/couches is really nice.

I'm thinking this would be a nice place for happy hour... not dark and closed in like some places... this is light and open.  

Their salads are big enough to share.
Their Mediterranean appetizer trio is awesome... love it!  
The chicken lettuce wraps are filling if you happen to get them as an entrée like I did.
Well... ok... so I was full after eating most of the appetizer and then my lettuce wraps.

Next time.... if I go with my mom again... we'll order 1 salad and 1 Med appetizer and that will do us just fine.

Note... don't order a Bellini... they don't make it with peach puree or peach juice... it just came out as sparkling wine.  This was a miss."}
{"text":"Quick look: quality and affordable comfort food. Specialty is gourmet wood oven pizzas and massive salads. Very comfortable, open air room - if you can figure out how to get to the front door! 

In depth review: very familiar with this Vegas Valley chain and decided to try it out on a Monday night. After a few minutes of navigation through the adjacent business park trying to figure out how to find Sammy's parking lot and entrance, we walked in and were surprised at how busy it was. Bar had a good crowd for MNF. After waiting a couple minutes we were seated at a large table / booth towards the front (facing Green Valley Parkway). It was a chilly Monday night and they did have one of the sliding glass walls open. I enjoyed the fresh air but my lady was cold (as usual). So bring a sweater or jacket if you go in Fall / Winter season at night. 

Service was prompt. Our waiter was still trying to master the little touch screen they use to take orders. He suggested a flatbread appetizer that comes with three different Hummus style dipping sauces. So we ordered that along with a margarita pizza and a grilled shrimp salad. Explained to him that we wanted the pizza and the salad brought out together as our entrees and that we would split them. So we wait about 25 minutes (too long) and finally our flat bread and dip came out to munch on as an appetizer. As soon as I reach for it another runner arrives with our entrees in hand. Was not too pleased and explained that we just got our appetizer and please take the entrees back. For some reason many quality places in Vegas have this issue with timing and seem to want to turn tables as fast as they can?!

Waiter comes back and apologizes. Blames it on the kitchen (obviously). Either way, we enjoy the appetizer and the entrees come out later. They were great. The salad was massive and could easily feed 2 - 3 people. The pizza was cooked perfect and blew similar style at a CPK or Settebello out of the water! 

We were too full for desert but I could see the tables around us ordering them and they looked delicious. Actually they looked massive and could easily be shared. 

Really not going to hold the issue with timing against them. They are a new spot and obviously need to work out some kinks in their operation. Our waiter was super polite and we think he will be just fine as soon as he masters that touch pad. He did comp the appetizer and our drinks. Manager never came to table to apologize but we are sure he signed off on the comp. Also did not get a good night when we walked out and past the hostess - but thats OK. 

We will be back. It's a really nice casual spot and very reasonably priced for the amount of food they give you. Great location and it should do just fine."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch location. Open atmosphere (literally the walls open), fast service and delicious food. 

I got a pesto chicken wrap with fries and could hardly finish it."}
{"text":"We went there Saturday night. It was great. We ordered greek salad, the pasta with chicken and a creamy sauce, which was very flavorful, and wine. It was a price fixed dinner. The pudding dessert was ok, nothing special.  The service was very professional and prompt. also, the rest room was being restocked when I visited, which shows attention to detail that I appreciated."}
{"text":"What a beautiful place.  The decor is lovely.  The very large sliding glass doors were open so we could enjoy listening to the birds and feel the warmth of the sun.  Food was delicious and the service excellent.  Definitely a return trip in our future."}
{"text":"Hi Julie 

  I never ever seen by management reply to a review, to me that is caring for your customers! I will come again, because the respect you shown to me, this to me is BIG! I was going to say something that day about the hostess, but my wife stop me, and just said don't say nothing, we just won't bother coming back again. I am sorry for bashing your place, but I was steaming, and to be honest the food me and my wife had was good, just the hostess, pissed me off, I never seen that in my life. But Julie I thank you very much for caring, and I will be back again. I am giving it 4 stars as for you and the food. Thanks again Julie"}
{"text":"I liked mostly everything about this restaurant. Was a little hesitant about trying it because every restaurant in that same building has not made it. 

I LOVED the decor and the fact the huge windows opened up especially on a spring night. Side note - they actually went against health code violation because they have the open walls/windows so close to food service and the bar without fly fans.

the wait wasn't long at all and the place was packed, only one empty table. The food was also fast, the fastest of any restaurant I've been to. 

Our waiter though was extremely awkward. He probably didn't know he was and maybe he was new? But the ipad ordering system may have had him confused because once I placed my order (out of 4 people) he sat there and typed trying to punch in my order for literally 3 minutes!!! we all just looked at each other like helllooo, are you ever going to say something like \"i'm sorry this is taking so long\" or \"what I can get for you sir\". Nothing, so awkward!!! And the fact he forgot our wine and the manager had to bring it to us was not really acceptable. 

I ordered the chopped chicken salad which was just eh. I might have been comparing it to balboa's (which is amazing) but that's to each it's own."}
{"text":"I was dining at this Sammys location today with a couple friends and I must say I was impressed. The service was good and our server was very attentive to our needs. The manager Tamara even stopped by to see how our meal was and if we were enjoying everything. I must say I will be back again because of the great service and awesome food. The duck tacos and Balsamic chicken salad are outstanding."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 3.5 star because I usually enjoy the food.  The service isn't usually that great but no big deal, the lobster bisque and garlic cheese bread (my favorite) out-weighs the not so attentive service.  Last night will be the last time I eat from this place.  I ordered the lobster bisque and garlic cheese bread to go and brought it right home and ate it.  About 2 hours later I began throwing up violently on and off for a couple hours.  Waking up this morning on Thanksgiving of all days still with a very upset and sensitive stomach.  I have no other \"illness type\" symptoms.  I think the need to have someone from the health department come out and check the dates and temps because I definitely got sick from eating from here last night.  Not good at all."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my family. I called ahead and they said it would be about 35min. We got there early and got seated on time. However, they need a better way or space for people waiting for a table. 

The ambience was very nice (Californian). Cozy.

The menu was very diverse with still the staple of Sammy's (pizzas). Boys got pizza and burger, thumbs up. Asian salad was okay. Shrimp and grits good, but have to grab some chorizo and grits for flavor. Salmon with edamame was horrible. Their idea of flavor is to layer soy sauce on the bottom of the plate. No! Deducted Star.

Service was okay. Waitress didn't seem to have a good day maybe?   Overall, service just seemed off from the time you come in the restaurant to the end of service. Deducted star.

I would go back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and ambiance.  Phenomenal, creative food.  Superb service.  Easy access location and parking.  5 star-slam-dunk.

Don't forget to try dessert.  O-M-G good."}
{"text":"Does not disappoint !!!
Sammy's is a great place to chill with my family , 
My kids always destroy The place and the staff is always nice ! 
Especially Albert !!
He rocks great se


Man this place doesn't disappoint !!
Was thinking about since last time I was here great food !! 
Albert is the man !"}
{"text":"Soooo happy to have found Sammy's here in Henderson. We loved going there when we lived in California but moved away from the areas of their locations. We went last night for New Years Eve, could not have been better! Happy to see the original (to us anyways) menu items. The chicken balsamic salad was as great as we remembered. The margarita pizza, splendid! We shared a Messy Sundae which lived up to its name. Great waiter, minimal wait time. Overall great evening. We will definitely be back to try out the newer menu items!!"}
{"text":"TWO STARS is all you get. Reason being I am glad this location was not taken over by a pawn shop, happy ending spa or a needle exchange and also because the food is decent. I repeat. The food is decent. 

My big beef with this restaurant is the service. When I say service I mean the Management. 

I have been to Sammy's on three separate occasions. First time with a fellow Yelper for brunch and I had the breakfast tacos which were good. Not great, but good. Service was on point.

Second visit was at lunch time on a Sunday with my mother. It took our waitress 25 minutes to get us our drinks. I realize how long it takes to get water and how difficult it is. What was even more annoying than our waitress was the fact that they let the patrons who were sitting at the nice bar in the center of the restaurant scream at the TV during the football game. They were tossing back $10 bottomless Mimosas and obnoxiously reacting to every play and startling all of the dining customers who most of them appeared to have just come from church. Not cool especially because this restaurant has a side sports bar where they should have been directed to. Not cool especially because the Managers did nothing at all about it. The Managers stood by the bar and watched the game the entire time, too! Not my idea for a relaxing Sunday brunch. If I wanted this ruckus I would have gone to the sports book!

Third visit I really disliked a pasta dish I was sharing. Took one bite and no more. I mentioned it to the waitress and was still charged for it. Way to keep it classy, Sammy's. 

NOT ONCE IN ANY OF MY VISITS DID THE MANAGERS TOUCH ANY TABLES TO SEE IF THE GUESTS WERE HAPPY WITH THEIR FOOD AND SERVICE.

Lastly, I did not want to write this review.It's my favorite time of year when I pretty much love everyone and everything.  I shared my frustration with their website directly. But, when 2 MONTHS later I did not receive anything more than a generated email response from the Sammy's website I knew I had to let the Yelp family know. I will not be playing it again, Sam I am."}
{"text":"I love this location cause it's so close to my real estate office! It used to be an Applebee's but they've really expanded and made this place look modern and breezy. Like all Sammy's, the menu is fantastic and the service is great. The salads meals by themselves and seriously could feed two people. The red quinoa salad and the greek salads are among my faves. Pizza is very good here too. But save room for dessert! I feel like my experience isn't complete with out a messy Sunday."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Great Shrimp and Grits!!! My waitress was very friendly and attentive! They have a great lunch deal, too: pizzas, soups, and salad combinations. I will definitely visit this place often!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!! Brought the family in because they have never been here and they loved it!! Food was amazing as always but Jules, our server, really made the experience. She Had a great sense of humor and was very attentive. Ask for her if you go in because she is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful atmosphere and very friendly staff. I will definitely be back. Also they have a great lunch special, 2 for $10. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Never order delivery from here!  I didn't receive 1 of my 3 items, and my goat cheese pizza has no goat cheese on it!  Plus I asked for no mushrooms on the pizza and it's covered in them"}
{"text":"Mike, the bartender here is awesome. I came in here with a golfing buddy after a round of golf with the intention of only staying for a couple hours to have a few drinks and eat pizza, but ended up staying here until 2am having a great time. The pie is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch and the place was almost empty

When we arrived we asked for the no kids section and was placed at a booth with only  one other couple in the area

Next couple in the restaurant had a baby with them and was placed next to us even after they requested a different location 

Thanks for the no kid area 

Service was S L O W

Waited 10 plus min between empty Coffey cup and refill. Asked for a carafe and it held one cup of cuffed and was empty

Took close to an hour to get served after we ordered and the Couple  seated after us got their food before we got appetizers 

Only saving grace was the food tasted good"}
{"text":"I have not one complaint about this place. I norm sit at the bar whn ever Im here. The bartenders are fast and attentive they def make for an enjoyable time and very friendly. The decor is hip and cool love the patio set up and big couches. Food so far so good I hvnt had a dish I did not like and you can order cotton candy for dessert!! Where they do that at!? I will say the drinks are a tad pricey but they have happy hrs and drink deals each night so it makes up for it :)"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday for lunch, the place was packed! what a beautiful setting, I felt like I was back in California. Very open and windows everywhere!
Sat at the bar, with the bartender Mary. Wow what a sweetie. She was truly on her game. 
My bf and I split a few apps. We had the hummus and duck tacos. Mary even had the chef prepare slices of the gluten free crust so I would have something other then veggies to dip. And the duck tacos, I could eat these everyday they are so good.
Grilled duck, with cilantro, tomatoes, fetta and some type of cilantro sauce. Theyre amazing.
We will def be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"My friend Sarah Jane invited me to the Sammy's elite event as her plus 1, but when she wasn't able to make it. She somehow got me invited with a plus 1 to the Sammy's VIP event a few nights later. I love that girl!

This was a complete success from start to finish. They executed this event perfectly. I was greeted at the door and she easily found my name. My friend wasn't there yet, so she wrote her name next to mine and assured me she would have no issues getting in. 

As I walked in I was greeted by more people, one offered me a glass of champagne. I went to the bar and almost immediately someone came up to me to offer a slice of pizza. The flow of the food was perfectly timed. It seemed just as I would finish one thing someone else was offering me a new item. Pretty much every thing I tried was delicious. The pizzas were great. My two absolute favorites were the Goat Cheese (Sautéed mushrooms, garlic spinach and red onion - which I took off) and Five Cheese (Gouda, Raclette, Romano, Mozzarella, and Gorgonzola - perfect). The Garlic chicken was my least favorite, although I did like the BBQ Chicken (Smoked Gouda, BBQ Sauce, Cilantro - I removed the ren onion, of course)

The duck tacos were great. I really liked the tomato/cilantro sauce. Duck is definitely one of my most under eaten but favorite meats. I love when a restaurant isn't afraid to use it. They also had a duck quesadilla that was pretty delicious. I was in duck heaven. 

Some other yummy things that I tried: Some kind of tuna on a cracker - perfect and some kind of fish tacos. Both were good, but I really liked the tuna. The specialty cracker (it didn't really taste like a regular cracker) paired perfectly with the tuna. I could have eaten 100 of those. So good!!

One of the only things I didn't like too much was the hummus. I'm not sure exactly what about it. Maybe I was just stuffed as it was one of the last things I tried, but I think I just didn't like it. 

Even the house red wine they were serving was pretty good. I tried a few of the specialty cocktails and although they were good. I'm not a cocktail girl.

Everyone was so friendly. Great customer service. We sat at the bar the majority of the night and even though the staff seemed very busy they were attentive. The venue is awesome. Large bar right in the middle. There's an atrium style room to one side with large windows. There's also going to be a tavern open 24/7 linked to the restaurant. 

I can't wait to come back on Thursday for ladies night. Ladies drink 2 for 1 8pm to 12am and also to try the mac and cheese, made with Tillamook Cheddar, my favorite!"}
{"text":"Really cool place. I went in right before brunch ended and I ordered the happy hour brunch breakfast tacos. These were delicious! Also tried the crispy fries which were equally as yummy. I will definitely be back for more brunch specials. Service was also on point."}
{"text":"Poor service at the bar. New York pizza was medicore. Honey pizza was a big letdown. It was more of a cracker than it was pizza or bread; a thin crispy cracker with some toppings on it.  And even at happy hour, it was not a particularly cheap tab; speaking of which, we had to wait forever just to get the tab. I had an empty glass half the entire time I was there. It's just not a place worth going to at all."}
{"text":"Great food and super service!  We had a large group and our server, Dawn was amazing!  Definitely one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Had salad and Thai spicy pizza split it with wife. Excellent both service and food was great. Ice tea for me always there with refills and wife had merlot $10.50 but potent."}
{"text":"The Tequila Chicken is amazing!  They also have 2 happy hours each day with great appetizer deals."}
{"text":"Where are you Marcus????? I come here because you are awesome to ALL the patrons !!! I hate it when I don't see you... Although I won't lie Miss Alesia doesn't take second place very kindly..... She makes it a little easier to be without you... EEK! Please don't poison me... Miss you and love you both for ALL you do to take care of the locals who love SAMMYS and promote this family owned and operated business since waaaaay......waaaaaay back in the day. This is a great spot for EVERYTHING!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since it opened and always had good food and service. Last Monday I visited again and had the BEST experience yet. The bartender was happy and smiling, but the waitress (Mandy) was exceptional. I worked in the service industry for over forty years and she is among the best I have encountered. You have something special in this young lady."}
{"text":"I was REALLY dissappointed last night at Sammy's.  Usually this place is on point with their salads, pizza, and happy hour.  But last night was such an exception that I felt I needed to write this poor review.
First of all, they were out of skinny margarita mix.  On a Friday night??  Really??  So, I settled for a Moscow mule which showed up in the wrong glass.  Our server said it was because they didn't have any more copper mugs.  As I drank it, I found something in my ice.  It looks like the stem of something...but it was frozen in the ice....so it must have been there for a while.  The server apologized and said she would have another drink made for me.  This one showed up in the right glass!  So they were or they weren't out of them??  She explained to me that the \"thing\" in my ice was a part of the mint.  It was definetely NOT part of the mint.  But whatever...I'll move on from the drinks.
The Kobe sliders were ordered medium and showed up well.  The flatbread was greasy.  The Chinese chicken salad was spicier than normal, and the New York pizza was awful.  
The service was ridiculous.  We could see that she was busy and I noticed managers running food, but we were there for 2 hours and the service never got any better.  We had no silverware at one point, no water for 20 minutes.  I usually give servers a break because I used to be one....but it was bad.  Not bad enough for me to call the server out online, though.
In conclusion, I won't be returning to Sammy's for a good long while.  It's too bad, too, because it used to be great.  Hope they work out their \"kinks\" soon."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews I was skeptical, seems that the service is hit or miss but after dining here and having several interactions with not just my server and the manager -the staff works as a team. Makes me wonder if the negative reviews are from difficult guests. The service industry is hard and when someone is rude, you do the bare minimum and avoid them like the plague. I'm in the industry, I understand. We came for the last day of the fundraiser for the gay and lesbian center which is amazing to show a company cares about its community.

The duck tacos were killer! The Lebni is amazing,hard to find this dish in town anywhere let alone one this delicious.  The cherry on top, literally, was the FREE Messy Sundae for checking in and first time guests. Will be back over and over again. 

Thanks to the girl with the short hair? Dawn? For making our bunch amazing."}
{"text":"We used to love coming here! But the service has gone down hill... Food prices have good up!! For a family dinner it's taken 1 hour just to get the food. 40 minutes to order!! And the order isn't even correct. How about writing the order down? 
Please Sammys hire more servers and/or train them better."}
{"text":"We love this place, it's one of our favorites. The food is always good, the servers and bartenders are all so friendly and happy. The Brussel sprouts are amazing!! I add salmon to any salad, truffle fries, yum!! Ahi tuna wontons, awesome.... Hummus is great!! They have an amazing happy hour which allows you to sample so many things for great prices!!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it is this location. I was pretty stoked on when this opened in Green Valley. It is walking distance and open 24hrs. I usually sit at the bar in the restaurant area. I asked the host if my boyfriend and I could park our bikes near the window so we could keep an eye on them. If course I forgot my bike lock. Thankfully they did not have a problem with it. 

The bartenders are very polite and never rushing which was nice since I'm very indecisive. I sat and hung out for a while and tried a few items. Lobster mac n cheese really weak. I make better mac n cheese at home.  The fries are really good but make sure you order a side of ketchup or two if you like to dip it. The Kung Paw Calamari is more like steak calamari. It is really good so definitely try it. I was not impressed with the Crab & Shrimp dip. The bartender let me try the watermelon cooler which was not good. Nothing exciting about that which I was bummed cause it sounded refreshing.  It is convenient to grab a bite or a drink late night or a happy hour but not if I want a good meal. 

Service: AMAZING
Food: Overpriced and not that great"}
{"text":"Called ahead just in case and the awesome hostess saved my wife and I a table near the patio area! So customer friendly! Our server, Jewells, was so attentive and helpful with the menu. Tried the duck tacos which were perfect, had a nice dirty martini, and the toffee pudding was excellent. We loved the decor and atmosphere- This is truly one of our favorite places in Green Valley! Thanks so much to Sammys for a great night out for me and the wife!"}
{"text":"Great salads and solid pizza.  Just avoid take-out.  They send you to annoying bartender.  Shitty service"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan, but my wife loves the garlic chicken pizza...The drinks are ok, and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I was really excited about Sammy's especially from all the great reviews at the Yelp Elite Event. Unfortunately it fell a little short for me. However, I am willing to go back again and give it another try. 

We ordered the Mediterranean Appetizer, Waygu burger, pear prosciutto and arugula pizza as well as the toffee dessert. 

The appetizer was delicious. I would order it again, the babaganoush and the cheese were my favorites. 

The Burger - Oh how we wanted to love you. The patty was well cooked and delicious, the bun was a soggy wet mess. It literally fell apart. I will attach a pic of what the bun looked like once we got it. He ended up just eating the burger alone and taking the remains of the bun off altogether. 

The Pizza- Delicious! It was a bit heavy on the cheese but I liked it. 

The Dessert- It tasted pretty good however it wasn't warm at all, not even room temperature. I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be warm ... I kid you not 18 minutes later she still said she had no idea. It was confirmed at the end by the chef it should have been. 

Management did comp our dessert which was very nice but not necessary. 

Service- Extremely slow, asked for napkins and we never got them. Had to ask for water after our glasses were empty. Our waitress was nice however she really wasn't around, Multiple people in our section complained about her. We waited about 10 minutes just to get the bill, then the waitress said she forgot and we had to wait some more. 

I'm hoping we just caught them on an off day. I like the ambiance and the location is perfect. Our waitress suggested we wait a couple more weeks before returning because its \"crazy\". 

We will do just that: be back in November Sammy's."}
{"text":"Was surprised to see this restaurant so slow for a Saturday night. We walked in and were sat immediately. Service was fast and friendly. The drinks came quickly and so did the refills. We ordered a Sicilian pizza and a large salad. Pizza was delicious and so was the salad. Grilled chicken on top of the salad was warm. The salad was large enough for two people. Don't make the mistake of ordering that whole thing for yourself. I really can't complain about any of it. The atmosphere is above and beyond what I would expect for a Sammys. I would go here with my friends."}
{"text":"Guaranteed great service. Staff is always fun and personable. The Greek salad is to die for! The messy sundae will put you in sugar coma. The atmosphere alone is open and cozy with great natural lighting."}
{"text":"just went again and it was awesome! Jamie Mandy Leo Ashley are just so super friendly! thank you for an awesome new year hope everyone is safe and happy."}
{"text":"Sammy's is a great place to spend happy hour and quick early dinners. Food is always consistent and the ambiance is good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Really relaxed and upscale restaurant. Awesome food (I had the sliders and they were literally the best I've had) 

On top of that my bartender Paul was awesome and  knew his stuff. 

Definitely a 10/10 would come again"}
{"text":"Great salad. We discovered an error a week later. Manager graciously took care of it. 
Good food great people."}
{"text":"I love Sammy's so it was disappointing today when we came in, got sat and no one came over to say hi, or give me a minute or I'll be right with you? There was no customers in the restaurant? It sucks when I see the manager who sat us see that no one has been over and she cant even cone over and say something:() We left after 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"We are \"regulars\" on Friday nights for a very good reason!  We love the food and we love the service. Garrett never fails to remember our drink order and our food order. He always follows up to make sure we're completely satisfied and makes us feel like family. We'll be back .... again and again and again!  Thank you Garrett!"}
{"text":"Beautiful new location with a lot of style! I used to dine at the location on sunset but their new location is wonderful! The staff is great, the food is great... I'll definitely be coming back! :-) I would recommend this restaurant to all of my friends."}
{"text":"This location is so much better than the GVP/Sunset restaurant, in my opinion.  From the service to the ambiance to the food.

Tonight we shared the chopped chicken salad.  Roasted Tomatoes AND kalamata olives please!  This is a consistent winner.  Plump, warm pieces of chicken with a little char, tangy dressing, tomatoes, tart olives, basil and mozzarella.  What's not to love?

I also ordered the Oak Roasted Chicken dinner.  Had to take most of it to go (it comes with 2 chicken breasts), but the pesto and pine nut concoction was great."}
{"text":"Nice environment, friendly staff. We came here for a company luncheon bc we heard the pizzas were to die for. Well that's partially true, I almost died when I took my first bite...I think little Caesars pizza is better,  and I hate little Caesars.  I'm sure other things on the menu are good, but that pizza ruined my taste to come back"}
{"text":"I loved this place. They have great happy hour specials, service is always great and the food and drinks are amazing. There are several locations and I haven't tried them all but I will definitely be back to this when many times!! And you must try  their messy Sunday!!"}
{"text":"Nice spot for brunch or dinner. Open design with a bar in the center. Front half of the restaurant has glass sliding door walls whic they ope. When the weather  is nice. Pretty good service and tasty food. Love the Sticky Toffee Pudding dessert!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequently dine at Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill on Green Valley Parkway in Henderson, NV.  We have found the menu to be varied, appealing, and tasty.  The entire staff, from managers to servers, have great people skills.  They are very friendly, efficient, and make us feel welcome.  Last night, March 2, are server was Jess.   Although they were extremely busy, Jess was very accommodating and timely with our meals.  In the past, we have also had exemplary service from Dawn and Rachel."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of Sammy's but I will make an exception for this Green Valley location! I love this location!! The 1st time I gave it and tried this place I was hooked! I went back three days in a row!! Lol Great ambiance, yummy food (mini sliders with gorgonzola cheese, pork dumplings, fries with sauce, shrimp & garlic pizza, & fried donuts are my favorites), & their spicy bloody mary's are delicious!! :-P Go check it out, especially during happy hour!! ;)"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit here. The floor to ceiling sliding doors coupled with the beautiful weather was so relaxing. My husband and I shared the shrimp salad, hummus and Brie pizza and they were all delicious. Our kids loved the wood fired pizza. The server was attentive and very helpful. Also, they give a great military discount, which we really appreciate. Great little neighborhood restaurant and we look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. I enjoy their food every time, always yummy and reasonable prices keep me coming back for more. Try the duck tacos when you're there, awesome! The staff are always friendly and have smiles all the time."}
{"text":"I was busy the evening of the Elite event at Sammy's so I did not get to attend... So when my sweet friend Jaime W. asked if she could take me here for brunch to celebrate my birthday I was stoked to check out the place so many of my Yelp friends had raved about. 

This is a gorgeous restaurant! I loved the beautiful decor...  It felt like we were dining on an island somewhere. I was also excited to see that a friend was being trained as a waitress while we were there... Sometimes it can be annoying to get a trainee as your waiter or waitress, but I enjoyed getting to see a familiar face (and she didn't make any major mistakes while serving us). 

As beautiful as the interior of Sammy's is, there were a few things that needed some work. I originally wanted one of the special 'handcrafted juice refreshers'  but they were unavailable. So I decided to get a mimosa, we were celebrating my birthday after all. Mimosas are listed as $8 on the menu with a $10 all-you-can-drink advertised as a Sunday special... but somehow, my single mimosa was $10. 

The highlight of the meal, for me, was the adorable little donuts that we started with. They were served with chocolate and raspberry sauces and were super delicious. 
The breakfast burrito I got was large, but just ok taste-wise. 

Sammy's staff was generous enough to give me a free dessert for my birthday, the Messy Sundae. It  was rather cool looking but uninspired in terms of flavor and very  difficult to eat.

Overall, I enjoyed my initial visit to Sammy's enough to want to go back sometime. Hopefully some of the kinks will have been worked out by the time I do so!"}
{"text":"As long-time fans of the Sammy's on Sunset, we were pretty disappointed when it closed. The grilled chicken balsamic salad cravings finally got the best of us, and we decided to venture out and find the next closest location. We were immediately impressed by the new space. There were some more traditional seating options along with some tables surrounded by big, fluffy couches. We were seated at a corner table surrounded by a long, curving couch and we began our wait. 

We waited for long enough for our server to greet us that we started to question whether we should go somewhere else. Just as we were getting up to leave, a server, Jules, hurried over to see what was wrong. She insisted that we stay and promised that they would take care of us. 

And take care of us they did! Jules was really friendly and engaging. I got the feeling that she was providing excellent service because it was the way she operated rather than just because she was trying to smooth over a rough situation. At her suggestion, we ordered an array of happy hour tapas rather than the individual meals that we were familiar with. It turned out to be great advice. We would definitely go back during happy hour because it was so much fun to try so many different little tasty treats. 

The rest of our experience was fantastic. The manager came over multiple times to make sure that we were satisfied. It took a little while for desserts to come out as the dinner crowd arrived, but it was a totally reasonable amount of time to wait for how busy it had gotten. The messy sundae was well worth the wait though. It was just as much fun to play with as it was to eat! The manger came by one more time to see us off and make amends on the check. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went on June 16 to Sammy's Restaurant and Bar on Green Valley Parkway in Henderson, NV and met a friend I had no seen in 20+ years.  Oh my gosh, the staff were awesome.  They did not intrude on our conversations and no one rushed us about anything.   At about 9:00 pm we stopped talking long enough to notice that the restaurant was 99.9% empty and apologized profusely to our server and others working there.  This was met with a \"no problem, we hope you enjoyed yourselves\".   We split hummus (beyond yummy), a spicy Italian Sausage Pizza (delicious) and a Caesar Salad (oh so good).  Needless to say, way to much food for the two of us.  Had enough for lunch the next day.  It has a little something for everyone and a full bar, which I always enjoy.  I have never been disappointed at Sammy's.  It's lively, very, very clean and easy to get to."}
{"text":"Place is pretty big. There is 4 sections (24hr gaming bar, indoor, regular bar and a \"patio\" section). We got there on Sunday around 6/7pm and it was packed. There was no seating area so we had stand and wait to be seated. 

We finally got seated after 15min, the waitress got us our beverages and took our order. 

Here is what I think of this place:
- slow service/barely any service
- dishes that are already on the table is dirty (still had old food residue)
- portion size of the pizza is a bit bigger than your typical Sammy's but it's not the same because they do not have a brick oven to cook the pizza. And they didn't use the artisan crust for the Brie cheese w truffle oil \"artisan crust\" pizza
- prices are a lot higher than your typical Sammy
- it took over half hour to get our food and when we got it, it wasn't even what we ordered so we had to wait some more. 
- place is very loud because if the high ceiling and glass surroundings

All in all my bf and I didn't like the place. We will stick to \"our\" Sammy's on 215 and rainbow where it's just much more intimate w great customer service."}
{"text":"To be fair, this was our second time dining at the upgraded version of Sammy's on Green Valley Parkway and we will NOT BE RETURNING.

The breakfasts consist of the same Sysco-type food that every other restaurant in Henderson (and Vegas for that matter)  have to offer.  The same frozen potatoes with peppers, small eggs from GMO fed farms (organic cage-free doesn't mean gmo free) and grossly processed meat.  So save a few bucks and just dine at the Grand Cafe up the street for the same low quality.  What ever you do, don't order your eggs scrambled - it's nasty.   Not sure what mix or cream they used, but it was like eating yellow creamy foam.  Never again.  I will drive the extra miles just to get the best breakfast on earth at EAT downtown.

For a place that boasts \"gluten-free\" options, I was stunned that they didn't even offer gluten free bread for breakfast.  Their juice drinks at $4+ a clip aren't even fresh - rather they are poured from a bottle and/or the equivalent to drinking a Coke.  

Cheap ingredients and originality is very low.  The pizzas could have been frozen for all I knew.  Bland and no flavor.   If you like matzo crackers, then the artisan pizzas are for you.  The salads were wilted and over poured with dressing.

During BOTH visits, the staff refused to give me box for our pizza!  They offered to \"box\" it, yet BOTH times they ruined two left over pizzas  by wrapping them securely  in aluminum foil!   Who does this?   Do they think  the toppings won't stick to the foil?  Or maybe that people with a nice car don't want food leaking???  When I asked for a \"box\", I was told, \"we don't give out boxes\".  Mind you, they give boxes for take out, but if you buy two of the most expensive pizzas and only eat half, you get foil.  I told her that I would pay for a box and so the waitress returned with a plastic container that was clearly too small for the pizza and said \"will this do\"? Then she walked away in a huff.   The two California investors for this restaurant standing by did nothing.

It is my hope that the CA investors who are constantly on the floor and yet strangely never  interact with patrons, will bring in a few experienced servers from California to demonstrate to Las Vegas waitstaff how the job should be done.  This \"i will probably only ever serve you once\" mentality is best left for Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"I won't go here again. The best part of it is its interior design. Long waiting time to be served. Waited 40 minutes for breakfast for two. Food is so-so, nothing special, eatable but for Vegas/Henderson is not a criteria. Bathrooms are dirty. Looks like it was cleaned not later then a week ago. After addressing this issue to the manager, I was told they were going take care of it. An hour later when I took my baby to change it was all the same. Then there was trash and dust next to the bar stand... Now I don't feel comfortable eating there, god knows how dirty is their kitchen.  If the place is dirty on Sunday morning I wouldn't go thee for dinner for sure..."}
{"text":"Food is great, but the service is terrible. Waited for 15 minutes for any wait staff to come to our table after being seated at 3:45pm--not crowded. Husbands food came out at least 5 min after my daughter and I got ours. No one checked on us until 10 minutes after we finished our food. Annoying!"}
{"text":"I came for lunch, and like most places lunch service fails. The servers couldn't hold plates properly. Their arms looked as if they were going to wobble off. They also sucked at clearing tables. The menu was hot mess!!! Asian, Mediterranean, Italian,  Mexican,  tapas, pastas, pizzas. Uhh... yeah. I couldn't figure out what to order! It took me forever. Normally I'd start ordering everything that looks appetizing, but nothing caught my eye. Maybe because I didnt know where to look.  Also im baffled at how huge the salads were, but then the entrees are so so, and you only get a soup cup of 8oz. It makes no sense!!! Like is the salad an entree? I'm so confused as to what is going on. The only reason I gave it a two was because it looks really nice inside."}
{"text":"I'm urging people to avoid this place at all costs. My daughters and I ordered a pizza. It was terrible. A frozen pizza from Smith's would have been better. The service was as bad as the food. The server seemed to go out of her way to avoid us. Then she overcharged us & the manager had to make corrections to the bill. There are many good restaurants in the Henderson area.  This isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town, this being my first experience with this restaurant i was impressed with the service behind the bar. First off Matty and crew did a fantastic job with their service. They were quick and attentive and Johnny on the spot with my questions. The drinks had a nice punch and mixed correctly so I could enjoy my meal and not be overly buzzed. The food well the Kobe sliders were nice, the pizza under whelming with first try cold. That was not my gripe, for the true downer to the attentive patron was the manger chewing out in slient fashion the bartenders for a issue with the togo's and taking out $10 from their tip jar. My business opinion, since I own three, is to have dedicated personal for Togo orders. The bar was super slammed with just restaurant business. The star of the show was the service at the bar and the sweet hostess whom picked up my fallen coat from my stool on more then one occasion. The empathy is there with the staff, and so I will be back tomorrow to try something new on the menu, for I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sammy's is amazing every time I come. Great Service and the food is outstanding. The Hummus and Duck Tacos Rock!!!"}
{"text":"Was meeting up with an old friend and thought we would try out their brunch. First let me start with this...$20 bottomless mimosas! Oh yes! So delicious and they do not hold back on making sure you're refilled when needed. We shared the charcuterie plate which was delicious. Had more mimosas and then she had the breakfast pizza and I had the breakfast tacos. All so tasty! I must say, our server Brian was fantastic and helped make for an amazing brunch!"}
{"text":"i met my daughter's for lunch.  Very good food and the service was great.  I took some of the Tomato Bisque soup home to my sweetheart and he loved it so much, that later that night we went for dinner.

We both had the Tomato Bisque soup, Caesar Salad and the angel hair pasta with tomatoes and garlic and extra virgin olive oil.......fantastic.

We got seated immediately and the service was fantastic.  Our server, Heather, was great.  This restaurant is a \"keeper\".  A very nice casual atmosphere and the seating was great.  Nice chairs to sit in and couches also........lovely bar.........and the bathrooms were really nice.  The doors for the stales went to the floor....very private......."}
{"text":"Still solid pizzas. I tried the lunch special yesterday.

 The fig & arugula salad is outstanding! It's a perfect balance of spicy (arugula), sweet (fig), salty (feta), and tangy (vinaigrette). That was certainly a highlight of yesterday's visit.

The margherita pizza was interesting. Sammy's interpretation is sliced roma tomatoes and julienned basil on top of melted mozzarella. I usually don't do too many raw tomatoes, but I nonetheless dug it. I'd order it again.

Without a doubt, Sammy's is still one of the top dining spots in Green Valley. If you have any doubts, try any of Sammy's pizzas and you'll understand."}
{"text":"We stopped in at lunch to try the $10 power lunch special.

Arrived about 11:45am, and we were seated right away. Sammy's is spacious, lots of tables, a large bar and it looked like banquet type rooms off the the side.

Our server was amazing. Friendly, fast and accurate, exactly what you need at lunch time if your on a time limit.

For my $10, I got a personal Pizza and a Greek salad. Both were great tasting, and it was plenty of food for the price.

We will be back again."}
{"text":"I am enjoying some apps and beer here on happy hour. Lobster Mac&Cheese so good. Good atmosphere friendly staff, Marcus our bartender making drink after drink with a Xmas party here yep he's doing a great job."}
{"text":"For awhile I was on a Sammy's kick and wanted to come here all the time. This spot is close to home and I like the ambiance inside of the restaurant. It has a sort of Florida feel.

The brunch here is great. The menu has a nice variety of options and all of the food is really good. I love the small plates here, especially the Lettuce Cups, Lobster Mac & Cheese, & Edamame. They also have a Raclette & Potato pizza that I enjoyed. It was a thin crust pizza with potato and cheese. It didn't have a traditional marinara pizza sauce making it a little different. Different in a good way. The Salted Caramel Pudding for dessert was one of my favorites too.

Now on to the reason why I don't come here anymore despite the fact that I love the food, ambiance, and location. The service was always a miss. The bad service was the most consistent thing that they do at this location. From slow service with disappearing servers to dirty dishes that sit on the table and aren't cleared I just got fed up. Since I liked the food I kept coming back, but ultimately the bad service started to mar the experience and I just couldn't keep coming here. I can deal with mediocre service for good food, but not awful service. The tables here are tiny and the tapas style lends itself to many plates. I found that we were always trying to clean the table ourselves since nobody would clear plates. Every.single.visit. The final straw was when we came in a group at my suggestion and I felt really embarrassed for even recommending the place.

So, the food is good, but you have to be able to tolerate slow and inattentive service to enjoy yourself here."}
{"text":"Cotton Candy on the dessert menu! Thanks Garret for the tasty drinks and great service."}
{"text":"Just had a long lunch at Sammy's with friends for a total of seven people.  The waitress was very attentive and was very thoughtful to suggest running separate checks to make it easier on the diners.  She was around frequently to refill drinks without ever having to be asked.  We ordered different wood fire pizza's and various salads.  I shared a thin pizza with sun dried tomatoes, pine nuts and goat cheese and it was so flavorful, fresh and light , I then shared a chopped salad with chicken with a very light red wine vinaigrette.  It was so fresh and delicious.  The serving sizes are very generous and the prices extremely reasonable.  New to the Henderson area,  this was the best restaurant I've been to.  I'm sorry I didn't remember the server's name but we were the only large table at 1 PM so many thanks for a great lunch.  For many of us at the table, this was our first time and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Middle of the week lunch with a friend and decided on Sammy's. Upon arrival, the restaurant was not busy for the day of the week. After a few minutes of socializing, we were waiting on our server, who looked as if she was consumed with more than she can handle. It took a little longer to get her attention and get in our food to meet the time requirement for the lunch menu special. My friend and I ordered a soup and each a subsequent dish. We both expected the soup to be out as our first course but instead, everything was brought out together. The server was very nice and polite but we felt that the service was a bit slow. The food was good and the atmosphere is awesome, the service, however can be little more refined."}
{"text":"Very good option In Henderson!!
Nice place, good food. Not expensive. 
Lot of choices on menu for different tastes."}
{"text":"Best. Tomato. Soup. Everrrrr!!

...among other things. Amazing Mediterranean Dip Sampler, Kung Pao Kalamari, and my favorite pizzas are the Burrata and Pesto & Marg-herita. 

Must try! Come for tapas, pizza, and entrees.

Loud during weekends, so come around 4-5pm on weekends or during week nights if you like it more quiet.

I only give it 4 stars because the management there is awful."}
{"text":"Had been to the other Sammy's on 215/Flamingo and the one on Rainbow in Arroyo Crossing Shopping Center. Both were good experiences BUT this place was drastically different. Upon walking in, place looks unkept and unorganized. We were seated and basically just sat there for 15 minutes and no one came over nor even bothered to address us that they would be right with us. There was some clueless blonde lady walking around(who appeared to be the manager) but did not really seem to notice her staff were just meandering about aimlessly. We walked out and went to Elephant Bar down the street."}
{"text":"With the multitude of bars around the Green Valley-Henderson area, we have options. But there is absolutely no place like Sammy's. If you've seen Cheers, the gaming bar is precisely that type of atmosphere. Everyone knows your name, your story, and you know theirs. If you're looking for a place to be a regular, this is the place. 

Jamie and Chris are THE people that put all of us regulars together and created a strong sense of community. Jamie works Friday through Monday nights, Chris works Tuesday through Thursday nights. COME. THESE. NIGHTS. I, Jamie and Chris, and all the other regulars will welcome you with open arms. I'm writing this as I am currently bonding with the rest of the crew and Jamie. He is immensely professional, all the while making you feel at home. Having an amazing relationship with guests is key and both of them blend that immaculately with professionalism.

We were raving about the great promotions Sammy's has had in the past, and management informed us that Jamie was actually the one who came up with many of the ones we were raving about! I work in Corporate Marketing for Caesars Entertainment and part of my job is to create promotions to keep our guests coming and generate revenue. My executives and I (who I introduced to Sammy's and love it as well!) agree that we would LOVE to have Jamie on our team, THAT'S how good he is. Chris is just as exceptional, and all of us regulars agree that we would follow both of them anywhere. My parents introduced me to Sammy's 4 years ago around their grand opening (they are as much of regulars as it gets and visit Jamie and Chris at least 3 times a week) and this is where I happily spent my 21st birthday week two years ago with both of them. They're like my big brothers!

Thank you for all the amazing memories you give us each and every visit, J & C. YOU are the true epitome of service at its finest. Cheers to the many years to come!

(Picture with some of the gang plus Jamie attached! We are family!!!)"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner tonight. The food was very good. But the staff did not seem knowledgeable. I'm in the restaurant industry. I have always worked where you need to know the menu. I ordered a glass of reisling and the server asked if it was red or white! I asked about the Greek yogurt on the menu she didn't know it was there. Upon leaving I asked the manager about it and he didn't know about it either. It still says 24 hours on website and menu but it's not! I will be back for the food. I just won't ask any questions. Get it together!"}
{"text":"Service is REALLY bad today.  Our server Ramon came by and took our drinks and then did not come back for well over 5 minutes to take our order.  He cleared plates from tables, stopped to check to soccer stats on the tv, stopped to talk to another employee before going to drop off the dirty dishes.

He finally came back and took our orders.  I told him I wanted to start with the chili and either the kitchen was really slow or our server took forever to pick it up and bring it to us.  

Throughout the meal he would disappear for a really long time.  Another table of two came in and were so annoyed they let him know how unhappy they were.  Needless to say their food came very quickly, but then he would disappear.  He brought us our bill when we were finally done, he dropped it off and disappeared for a good 8 to 10 minutes, really???

When we left, he was standing at the bar watching the soccer game even though he still had more tables to serve and did not even notice us walking past him, another employee also watching the tv noticed us and said goodbye as we reached the door.

Overall it was an interesting night, normally the manager comes around to see how things are going, not tonight....the only person I saw who looked like a manager hung out at the bar while the music was playing and when Ryan was done as he was cleaning up she hung out by him chatting with him.  I guess customers were not the priority on this night...."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza spot. My boyfriend and I LOVE pizza. This location is small but but it's gorgeous inside. Our waitress Keialiana was amazing!! Very attentive, great personality! We will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today for the first time. Everyone was super nice and helpful about some questions I had about the desserts. I got the mini Kobe beef sliders and they were rocking. Love the chipotle aoli on them and I added Gorgonzola and it was a perfect match. For dessert, we wanted to get the cotton cnady but we were too full and opted for the crispy donuts, they were a cross between french crulers and funnel cake and simply delicious. Would definitely be back to try some other things!"}
{"text":"I frequent Sammys on GV Pkwy, I eat in the restaurant and I gamble at the bar. The food is always amazing and the bar service with Mandy is exceptional!"}
{"text":"totally forgot to post, saved in my drafts saw as I was going to review dinner tonight. So I'm going to complete it now.. #LatePost. I love the new staff and always sit at the bar with Roxanne for lunch. She's wonderful, remembers my drink and order, she has lots of patience when dealing with needy guest. Sitting at the bar I see a lot and she is a true Gem for this location. The food is fresh and the drinks amazing.\""}
{"text":"I love the intimate setting. Service was great. Prices are fair. 

My boyfriend and I usually order different entrees so we could steal bites from each other's plates, but we both thought the chicken tequila fettuccine sounded good. 
And it was! It's a spinach fettuccine with bell peppers, onions and tequila-lime cream sauce. Maybe the cream was a tad bit too rich for us, but it was delectable nonetheless.

Looking at the pics, I'm bummed out we didn't find room in our tummies for dessert! The messy Sundae and the mini donuts look so good! I can't wait to go back for those!"}
{"text":"Great Service..excellent happy hour tapas  menu  & 1/2 price drinks. Food was well presented  & had great taste. Olives & toasted almonds were a treat.Had live music
that was a bit loud is only negative. Highly recommend .. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! The chicken tequila fettuccine and Brussels sprouts keep me coming back time after time. The managers Paras and Jon are always welcoming. Barbara is such a great server and makes the experience that much better! And Garrett's cocktails... the perfect pair to the meal!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to just hang out with a bite to eat. It is very laid back and has great service.  I love their shrimp appetizer. They even have little dippers for youngsters which my granddaughter adored.

The wine prices are right on par for a dining establishment. They have a decent variety of bottles or glasses. I really like their pinot selections which are not usually offered by the glass. 

They offer pizzas with whole wheat or thin crust. If you ask, they will thin out the wheat crust for you too-my favorite. They also let you add or change toppings. I love to take a great veggie pizza and add some pepperoni. 

Don't forget dessert! Their messy sundae is shareable and delicious!"}
{"text":"Cool vibes, good food, entrees are pricey. 

I came here for lunch; the pizza I had was great and was a good price. Our server was very attentive and friendly. The restaurant is very well decorated and has a very trendy vibe, which felt incongruous with its clientele. Overall I was really impressed. The only thing we didn't like was that all the pasta dishes and other entrees started around $18, which was a $6 leap from the salads and pizzas."}
{"text":"Sammy's wood fire Pizza is one of my Favorite restaurants for Salads. They make the best Chicken chopped Salad. It's out of this world. With that said all there food is really Good. I can't say enough about the place. For the ones that have never tried it please do you will be going back as a regular.

{"text":"We had a reservation for 6 people and they had our table ready. Our server was on it great service and door. The server also remembered we had a birthday and she brought out a dessert for our birthday girl. I highly recommend Sammy's."}
{"text":"THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! WAY TO GO JULIA!!!! I've lived here for 8 years and have gone to many restaurants, including other Sammy's in Las Vegas/Henderson!  We, myself..my fiancé and our son, came to this location for Mother's Day today and was honestly the best service and food in the entire time I've lived here!!!!  Our Server JULIA, honestly made us feel we were her only customers and the place was packed. She not only gave GREAT customer service, but an attitude that made us feel like we mattered and we were welcome, she didn't treat us like we were just \"another table\". She small chatted with us, which was nice and unexpected, and her GM, Rick, came by later at the end of our meal and made sure everything was to our standards, and we were satisfied. I cannot sing enough praise on both of their behalf, and to the rest of the staff. Great dining experience, great food, great time!"}
{"text":"Did I stumble into Summerlin? Holy cow this place is all kinds of sexy and very modern. Wayyyyy different then the older Sammy's. Sammy's got it's groove on. The wife and I meandered in Wednesday for some happy hour and grub. The place was humping and I was really impressed by the space. It had a welcoming, yet cool hip vibe. They were doing a wine dinner that night so we ate at the bar to avoid a wait. The service was good and the food was typical Sammy's; good price and great taste!"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day and it was slam packed. Staff was very professional and friendly. We got free Mimosas for the occasion. Our waitress was awesome. We ordered the humus which was really good. My husband had pizza and he really liked it. I had the French roast and it was the best I have ever had. The only issue I had was the music was really loud. We had to ask them to lower the volume a little. They had a live singer that covered great songs and she had a lovely voice. Not sure if she sings regularly but we really enjoyed it. Would totally return."}
{"text":"I have never felt so compelled to write a negative review about a restaurant. My husband and I consider ourselves very patient and understanding people but we left Sammy's last night extremely agitated. 

My husband, 19-month-old son, and I arrived yesterday around 5 pm and were seated promptly. The restaurant was still pretty vacant when we got there. Our server, Ramon, came and took our drink order and then vanished. He finally came back 10 minutes later to take our food order. Our food was delivered while it was still hot. However, our waiter never returned to check on us. We finished our entire meals without seeing our waiter. Our waiter finally arrived 15 minutes after we finished our meal and handed us the check (he never asked us if we needed anything else or how the food tasted). He vanished again! Finally, I told my husband to take my son to the car while I waited. Another waiter walked by me and I asked him to take care of our check. He graciously agreed. 

I don't mind waiting longer when a restaurant is busy. However, we never saw our waiter walking around. Nothing irritates me more in a restaurant than when I feel like a \"hostage\" (can't refill my drink, can't leave, etc) because the waiter is no where to be found!"}
{"text":"This is a great place! Warm ambience, great food and excellent service. It's not as casual as it sounds so don't show up in your gym clothes. Be prepared for a nice dining experience, and don't forget they have wine Wednesdays, where all wine is half off!"}
{"text":"One of my fav spots in Henderson/GVR for the atmosphere and the food is fairly tasty. Great place to grab a drink and chill with friends. cool seating for dining and at the bar. Definitely upscale and different from most Sammys."}
{"text":"Just finished some dinner after a long hike & wow, everything I could want. Sat at the bar & Rachel, the bartender greeted me & my fiancé. Rachel was super helpful , describing the food to us & letting us know her favorite drinks & we continued to order some happy hour food, 4-6 everyday. Food was amazing, service exquisite & I highly recommend Sammy's to all our friends & family. Woo woo"}
{"text":"There last night with a group of friends on my recommendation. Terrible, terrible service.  Server skipped 2 people when taking drink orders. Just walked away.  The tapas appetizers were brought out b4 any drinks and in mixed up increments.  2 never came.  Kept asking bus people for our drinks.  Had to ask where the 2 flatbread appetizers were.  Finally drinks show up.  Then main course.  For all but 2 people.  Had to keep asking for their meals.  The rest of us finished our meals b4 they got theirs.  Just a damn shame.  Wanted to see manager on way out but couldn't find.  Makes you not want to go back and I would certainly never recommend it ever again!"}
{"text":"I haven't read any previous reviews as I don't want to be influenced.  We were very excited when we heard Sammy's was coming to the vacated former-Applebee's location 5 minutes from our home.  We went to Happy Hour on Friday.

It was crowded but we still got 2 seats at the bar.  First, the good news:  The Kobe burgers were exceptional, nice touch with the optional Gorgonzola cheese.  We liked the shrimp & artichoke dip, much better than the spinich-artichoke dip we had at the nearby Elephant Bar the night before.  The Thai chicken satays were good with an exceptional peanut sauce.

The house Chardonnay was Grey Cellars, I believe, at the discounted price of $5.50 a glass.  Not bad.  Some of the normal appetizers were half-price.  Again, not bad.

But, as a former bar manager at a high-volume restaurant-bar in Dallas and former restaurant owner, I was shocked by the very poor service at the bar.  This comes from an owner's perspective in that it was so slow and unattentive that a lot of money was left on the table, for the restaurant and the corresponding 20% tip.  

The design and layout of the establishment is outstanding.  The south walls were totally open and the seating was very unique in certain areas giving you the feeling of being at somebody's home.  Fantastic!

The design of the bar did not anticipate any high volume.  The lower inner portion of the bar prevents close interaction from the barkeep with the customers.  They have to lean way over in spots to serve customers at the bar.  The width of the bar is not conducive for good assistance from bar-backs.  It is very crowded back there.  The bartenders are responsible for the high number of to-go orders phoned in.  The bartenders should be selling drinks and food while appeasing the clients at the bar, not serving up bags of already-ordered carryout meals.  

Subsequently, we would have ordered at least one, probably two more rounds of drinks in the time we were there.  We could not get the attention of the bartender to give us our final tab for over 10 minutes.  Even after requesting the final bill, it took another 10 minutes to get our charge card ran.  Again, putting the \"owner cap\" on, the customer turnover at the bar would be much faster with better service at the bar.  Thus, the restaurant and the bartenders are losing money.

I know Sammy's owner is damn good.  Overall, his restaurants show that.  BUT, I wish he would have given me a phone call asking my advice on the setup of the bar.  

We will come back, but never on a busy night."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! I've been going here since before they relocated. The reason I only have 4 stars is because the service is just mediocre. But the atmosphere is awesome. I recommend  the walnut chicken salad. Hands down best thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"Shrimp and crab dip was bland. The pizza was mediocre at best. Saving grace was the service and atmosphere. Overpriced for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent service, waiter was great. Nice new clean vibe from place, gaming area in back is recommended. Had wagyu burger and fries with lobster mac and cheese. Burger was a bit undercooked so it fell apart, otherwise better than most average burgers. Friends were above average as well, seasoned with steak seasoning.  Lobster mac and cheese was cooked and seasoned well. Would recommend this place for a quick tasty lunch with great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"After the yelp elite event (which was fantastic) I knew I had to return to Sammy's for a meal.  I'm glad I did.  I had lunch on a weekday and it was busy.  Not packed, but at least half full.  Very brisk business.  I sat in the kind of half couch tables that face the bar.  VERY comfortable and unique.  Had a good view of the TV, but you have to turn your head slightly.  Service was a little spotty as the bartender was busy.  This is why I usually don't sit in the bar area at restaurants when I am dining.  However, once I ordered, my food was out very quickly.

I had the sliders with fries and added gorgonzola cheese.  Fantastic.  The bun is soft and toasty and did not fall apart.  This was particularly impressive as the burger was JUICY.  The patties are flavorful.  I could use a little more of the sauce, next time I order them I'll probably ask for more on the side.  The fries are good, thin and crispy with some nice seasoning.  

Cool design and atmosphere with a comprehensive menu.  We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Lauren is the best bartender possible. Her sass and wit are unmeasured and her cocktails are delicious. Will be visiting basically all the time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how the full menu us here but the tapas/appetizer section is fantastic! We got the lentil, prosciutto, and arugula salad (not sure why it's called this because it's not a salad, deconstructed or not), the duck tacos, coconut shrimp, almonds and olives, and lobster Mac and cheese...

The duck tacos and lobster Mac were really really delicious, big hunks of real lobster and good flavor on Mac and the duck tacos were really nice and meaty and crispy. The olives and toasted marconas were really great quality too and I really liked the salad - you know, for not being a salad and all. The only misfires were the coconut shrimp and it wasn't a misfire so much as they were a little boring and a bit over cooked but we were pretty much tearing up the rest ;). The wine we ordered was turned but that happens. The weird part was the waitress seemed to anticipate a problem and almost be waiting to see if we could tell the difference. When we told her the wine was way off she acted like she figured it had gone bad, we kind of looked at each other in surprise at the table. I hate to speculate beyond that because I really loved the meal and casual atmosphere but if you get some less than yummy wine, do us all a favor and vanish it to a land far far awayyyy!!"}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner, Wednesday 1.20.2016. Had one elderly mom using a walker. Maybe had 20 tables in the immediate area to sit and the host starts walking us past the 20 tables all the way to the rear of the restaurant. Not sure why they would even think of having the guest struggle walking let alone that distance, when we were standing next to available tables.
The waitress was prompt & courteous, took the order, received drinks, food was fantastic!
Than she disappeared. The rest of the meal no service was to be had. Just plan awful. Could not even get our check without tracking her down. Once we had the check she never came back to pick up the payment.
For that reason it will be along time before I go back to this establishment. They really need to step up the service to at least OK instead of horrible!"}
{"text":"Sammy's is a great place to go with friends or family coming into town or just for a nice night out. It is on the pricier side but worth It. Their food is high quality and very flavorful! Definitely recommend their salads. So yummy"}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been to Sammy's and Joel had never been so when he won a $25 gift certificate we decided to check it out for lunch. 

I enjoyed the atmosphere. It was very calming with all the light woods and fake water tanks. Our server was very prompt and brought us our drinks. I really loved the menu. I'd go back just for the tapas. They all sounded very yummy. We picked the Duck tacos to start with and I got the Shrimp pasta and Joel got the New York style pizza. Wow! The Duck tacos! Yuuuuummmmy! I could have just eaten like 20 of these little bite size tacos. You do get 6 tacos ( I was forced to share with Joel. Hehe) they are filled with grilled duck, a creamy avocado and cilantro sour cream, queso fresco, and bits of tomato and fresh cilantro. Really! What a treat that was. My Shrimp pasta was also so yummy! (I love that I had the choice of whole wheat pasta.) My dish contained huge shrimp, zucchini, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and it was all mixed with a light and creamy lobster sauce. I was in heaven! The $19 it cost was so totally worth every penny! Joel's pizza had mushrooms, pepperoni, salami, and Italian sausage with a red sauce. The sauce was full of flavor and Joel loved all the meat that was on it. 

Other then our waitress not noticing the gift certificate and charging our card full price it was a great experience. ( she felt really bad that she messed up) The decor is great, the atmosphere relaxing and the food was on point. It is a bit pricey, but with the level of food they have it's justified. Can't wait to go back and try more of their tapas."}
{"text":"I went here 3 days in a row after my first experience because I absolutely loved the location. The open windows allowed airflow and direct sunlight which made my experience even better. (I'm all about that direct sunlight and breeze) it reminded me of a restaurant you'd eat off the beach in Hawaii or California. 

Definitely try the Mini Kobe Beef Burger with both cheeses and ask for extra Chipotle Aioli sauce on the side for the fries. Tasted so delicious."}
{"text":"Early dinner, late lunch maybe. Had the fettuccini Alfredo. Good flavor, sauce was nice and thick, been here before but didn't check in, had the wood fired pizza and it didn't disappoint. I recomemd Sammy's for a casual dinner maybe early lunch. Good service"}
{"text":"Clearly and without a doubt, it was Barbara that made our visit fantastic.  Personally I was a little concerned when there was no one at the door when I arrived to meet my dinner guest so I had to venture around, and that was the only hit. After that Barbara took over and made dinner a truly satisfying experience. Food was hot, brought out without a long wait, delicious, and best of all was our Server ... Barbara who has only been there 3 days!!!  She's a really good hire!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of Sammy's for years but as time as passed my tastes buds have matured. When I heard a new location opened closer to home, i decided to check them out. 

The place is huge and elegant, especially the bar area its perfect for happy hour.
La Dou's Barbecue Chicken pizza is fantastic, nice balance of sweet and savory.
I also got the Spicy Italian Sausage, it was okay I thought lacked flavor.

Overall it was an okay experience, hasn't changed much since the last time i went.
I'm glad it's still around it brings back good memories."}
{"text":"A good friend recommended I try Sammy's for a casual business lunch.  First impression was of a pleasant decor and intriguing menu. But my salad was awful.  They appeared to be understaffed by at least one server as we waited and waited for iced tea refills, which finally came with no ice so we drank warm tea.  I didn't plan on going back, but my wife wanted to see if we might have a better experience my second time.  We did.  She really liked the sliders and I ordered a different salad (the balsamic chicken) which was quite good.  Still seemed to be understaffed though.  One more quality waiter would really improve the timing of their service."}
{"text":"No stars tonight waited 10 minutes no one came to our table the whole time  ... But we are gonna give them another chance next week cause the food is so good."}
{"text":"Last we was the first time dining at this location. The food was excellent. I had the Artichoke and Garlic pizza.  Yummy...especially if you like garlic, it's loaded with it. Our servers was attentive and the atmosphere light and comfortable. I will be back."}
{"text":"Went here on Wednesday and was happy to find out they have wine Wednesdays. Half off all bottles! I was in the mood for some small plate options and this had some interesting things on the menu. My husband and I started with three which would have been enough but decide to squeeze in one more.
Duck Tacos-Great sauce but meat could have had more flavor.

Meditarnian dipping plate-Terrific! Fresh pitas, great hummus and the cheese and sesame so very good.

Pork dumplings - decent with a little crunch which was nice.

Coconut shrimp with orange/horshradish dipping sauce-Amazing! The best thing we had. They should bottle that sauce.

Over all the atmosphere was very nice with comfortable seating, dim lights. Our server was terrific (I think her name was Adriana?). Service was quick, attentive and our wine was very good.

The only reasons it didn't get 5 stars was:
A) The host was slow greeting us at the door. It would have been nice if the servers or bartenders at least greeted us as they past and let us know someone was coming soon.
B) It was just a little pricey for the food. Not too bad, just a little over what it should be I think.

We will be back on Wednesdays for sure!"}
{"text":"We had heard great things about Sammy's so we thought we would give it a go. We were greeted and sat promptly. Very crowded and had families around which made it a little loud for intimate conversation. I ordered a Lobster mac and cheese for a tapas appetizer, was not as impressed as the reviews posted said I would be. I did see a lot of them ordered. If it was half of the price it was offered at I would have been okay with it. taste wise it was good, had lumps of crab meet and a good amount of cheese. I ordered a pizza The New York Style. I thought New York style would at least be cooked through. The crust was crunchy but the middle was under cooked and doughy. not impressed. Not sure what specialty is here since their menu is all over the place. Josie had the Grilled Hawaiian Mahi Tacos. These were fresh and spicy, maybe too spicy for the spouse. I had some and I thought her choice for dinner out did mine. Overall it was nice, they were attentive which is a must. May or may not go here again. Can say to try it your experience may out way mine."}
{"text":"Our group comes here every month for about six months and Julia always waits on us. She remembers our drinks and orders. We get great service and we love the privacy of the back room. Great food and great service, you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We used to love Sammy's but as of tonight we will no longer be dining there. I was asked to leave because my 3 year old was crying, no louder then music and ambient noise. We saw exactly who complained and it was not multiple people. I was not in anyway ignoring my child nor did I have any disregard for the other patrons.

I do need to recant my review above.... Paras the regional manager and the GM have since made contact and we have resolved what had happen. To everyone reading this, everyone has different parenting styles and from the outside you do not know their situation. Please do not judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"Always love coming here! It's right by my house and happy hour 4-6 is AWESOME. Please try the duck tacos and thank me later!! Tried fried calamari for the first time this week and I have to say it wasn't what I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised. Service is always great and atmosphere is very nice. Came here last week for game 5 of the Stanley Cup and was surprised at how perfect it was. We sat at a nice table in the dining room facing a tv on the bar and the place a not too crowded, but pleasantly full of Knights fans. Great place!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful location. We were on our way back from Lake Mead so we stopped by here for a quick bite. We were seated near the door next to the lovely green outdoor garden. With the cool breezes flowing around us, we enjoyed looking at the fake but beautiful orchid and green plants, as well as munching on the fish tacos, lobster bisque, chicken lettuce cup and even a few beers! Even though I thought they were rather salty, I liked them and I would totally come back to try more items!"}
{"text":"Order came out wrong. Food fair. Seats at table uncomfortable. Noise level made conversation difficult."}
{"text":"I came here with my entire family after a whole day of noshing. I wasn't necessarily hungry but I had no choice. We normally go to the Sahara location and it was my first time at this location which is close to my aunt's house. I love the interior...classy-looking for a pizza place. 

My favorite is their goat cheese pizza but that's what I always get so it was time to try something different. We got the brie cheese and truffle oil thin crust pizza, wagyu burgers and mini kobe beef burgers.

Brie Cheese and Truffle Oil Thin Crust Pizza:
I love brie and truffle/truffle oil. Our server warned me this was going to be very truffly and fragrant - it was not the case. The brie was strong enough to subdue the truffle oil a bit. 4/5

Kobe Beef Sliders:
The beef patty was juicy. The gorgonzola was great with the burger. Comes with fries. 3.5/5

We had a few family members with very specific requests which were all granted. So, I can't complain. The service was great. Their menu seems it has more items compared to the Sahara location."}
{"text":"We like going to Sammy's... but every time we step in the door we remember how horrible the service always is. The food is great, just an awful lack of service that doesn't match the the dollar signs here. We were seated to our table and waited 7mins until we were greeted and once we told our server our beverage order, she disappeared for another 4mins to grab our waters and my boyfriend's tall Blue Moon. Then, although we were beyond ready to order our food, she disappeared for another  5mins. We were really hungry and really impatient at that point. We felt bad but we just grabbed our drinks and made our way to the bar, as she was taking way too long. The table next to us even noticed our irritation, as they sat there with the same irritation because they had been sitting for a while without service too. As we got up and moved ourselves to the bar, that table next us got up and left the establishment. We obviously told the bartender why we moved and he apologized but hardly had any urgency and the manager was even right there and she didn't even care! It was a rather lengthy late night dinner and we're definitely disappointed, as we always are when we leave Sammy's. Can't come here when I'm in a hurry that's for sure. Guess I'll stick with California Pizza Kitchen for similar menu items and much better service. Doesn't ever get any better at Sammy's unfortunately."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and it's always consistent.  Inside is beautifully decorated and duck tacos are always yummy.  Feta cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and the tender duck.  How can you go wrong.  The Vietnamese crab stack is delicious as well.  Ask for extra bread and u can enjoy as a full meal.  Sliders are great... moist and juicy.  

Go during happy hour and appetizers are half price."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here many times as well as the location on Rainbow Blvd. Tonight was just as fantastic as the previous nights, however our waiter was as good as it gets! Zach was knowledgable, funny, and always kept our glasses full. Keep staff like him around and you'll continue to have our business."}
{"text":"Nice people, good food, convenient to work and home. I dine here frequently, and have had no complaints so far. I almost had a complaint earlier because of some child screaming. I understand it's hard to raise infants/toddlers, but it's also common decency to try to comfort the kid without being a nuance to other patrons. Not this parent. This mom decided to ignore the screaming and totally disregard the other people trying to dine at the establishment. I was about to make a complaint, but apparently somebody beat me to it. The parent was asked to take the screaming kid outside, and the parent threw a fit. Immediately I saw where the child gets their mannerisms from, as the mom proceeded to cuss out and berate the employee that kindly asked them to step out. Mind you, the employee didn't tell her to leave and never come back, she kindly asked her to take her son outside momentarily to calm him down. Nothing rude about the employee, extremely rude of the mom. I'll continue to come here, as they genuinely care for the convenience of all patrons.

Update: So, I gotta say, what is going on with the music on Sundays? It's like elevator music for hipsters. I just got done listening to an electronica version of Bob Marley's \"Is This Love,\" and I'm pretty sure Bob is rolling in his grave due to that rendition (and listening to it, made me want to join him). 

Now the song that's playing: it's like a song that makes me want to play in traffic or dance the salsa. Either scenario is probable at this point, but I'm leaning towards the first option.

Here's a recommendation, since it's a pandora station from what I believe: Put it on Gary Clark Jr.'s station, and call it good. Some awesome blues would be fitting for the atmosphere. 

You're welcome. Keeping the rating at a 5, even though the music on Sundays is upsetting."}
{"text":"What can I say about Sammy's that hasn't already been said? 

The food is terrific! It's always such a treat to see a whole wheat crust pizza option. The salad portions are huge. Seriously, huge. My only wish for them is that there'd be a smaller/cheaper salad option that I could add on to my meal. 

I just love the ambience of this restaurant. It's modern but comfortable. Little to no area to hang out, though, while you wait to be seated... That awkward moment when you're standing half inside/half outside unable to close the door as you wait to be greeted by the hostess. 

The service was incredible. They accidentally made my pizza with a regular crust instead of the wheat that I'd ordered. They quickly brought me the correct pizza despite saying I'd just stick with the wrong one and took it off the bill to make up for my \"troubles\". That is seriously the way to retain loyal customers! Kudos, Sammy's. 

Can't wait to go back and try some of the tapas from the half off menu at happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! The managers and wait staff are friendly and professional. Mandy in the gaming lounge is wonderful! She is attentive and is always smiling. Keep up the good work Sammys!"}
{"text":"Sad state of affairs. Just left there from having lunch. Ordered sliders. I asked if they can substitute the burger for a veggie burger. The food server said yes. When she brought the dish to me, it was a lousy tomato and cucumber sandwich. No burger, no cheese. Just really sad. The fries were good however. The grey goose martini that I ordered was $16. Whaaaaaaaaaat? Omg it wasn't even that good. Too much vermouth. I don't think I will go there again. And to top it off our food server looked stressed out and I felt like not complaining cuz she already looked upset upon the onset of service. Again sad state of affairs."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! We were celebrating Father's Day with the family. There were 2 open booths, so we asked for a booth & the hostess said she just sat people there & stuck us on a table between 2 large parties. The waiter came by 10 minutes after we were seated & apologized for his delay & took our drink & food order & left. We noticed that no one ever sat at those booths & now there were 2 more booths available so we asked again for a booth & were sat at a booth. Twenty minutes later our food came & was on its way back to the kitchen since our original table was empty & they thought we left the restaurant. We flagged them down & complained to the manager that our drinks were still not out. She made a face & said she'll check on it. The food was good & the waiter added a free dessert but disappeared again & after waiting for 15 minutes for him to pick up our payment, I walked over to the kitchen and handed him my credit card. Worst Service Ever in a restaurant which was mildly busy.
I called the restaurant 25 minutes later & was extremely disappointed AGAIN...

Horrible Customer Service! We left the restaurant angry because of the terrible service on Father's Day & forgot our left over to go bag on the table. Less than 30 minutes later I called the restaurant & the hostess tells me they tossed the bag because no one ever comes back for pick up after they leave the place. 
We eat out a lot as a family & these guys have the worst customer practices of anything I've experienced so far in Henderson, Nevada."}
{"text":"The staff is awesome! The gaming is loose 24 hrs! Great Happy Hour and brunch on the weekends.  Not to mention the fireball is always cold."}
{"text":"We went for an event the other night and WOW best food in town, seriously!!! They serve 4 dif salads all FABULOUS, 4 did piazzas 'to die for' & 4 dif pastas all Fantastic, my fav was angle hair pasta with Tomatoe sauce, I'm going back SOON!! Y'all should go TODAY!!!"}
{"text":"I am so excited to have this fabulous restaurant so close to my home. The food here is so good, and I plan on eating here a lot! I love love the salads, especially the shrimp salad, I could eat it daily! The pizzas are wonderful, the crab stack appetizer, chicken lettuce cups, literally everything is delicious. This is destined to be one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Sweet Chili Chicken Wings, NY Style Pizza and Lamb Tacos were delicious.  Service needs some work, not very attentive and didn't know the menu very well.  We are from out of state and would return on our next visit."}
{"text":"This place was okay. It was my only off-strip dining the last time I was in Vegas, and I just ordered a bunch of shareables (sorry...English spelling): ahi pokes, edamame, curried cauliflower, mahi mahi tacos, baba ganoush, and so on. It was good. The service was very attentive. It's in a business park and isn't the kind of place I would usually go, but I was meeting a group and for that it was perfect."}
{"text":"Food is okay. I got the Thai chicken salad and it had too much mint in it which was unpleasant. Bartender Travis is awesome. Hostesses sucked (seemed clueless and did not adequately tend to waiting customers), and the waitress was a little kooky (not in a good way). Restaurant was way too cold to be pleasant."}
{"text":"Must go to Sammy's for the dessert!  They have a great happy hour and beautiful atrium seating.  The pizza is good and has many other options on their menu."}
{"text":"Weren't sure what to expect but the interior was nicer than we had anticipated. My husband and I are currently on a keto diet (zero carbs) and the kind waitress accommodated easily. 

Tuna poke to start without wontons it was delicious. 

My husband had the Greek salad and she warned the dressing may have a pinch of sugar so we switched it out. 

I had the wagyu burger with a lettuce bun. Wasn't asked how I wanted it cooked but it was delicious. 

Overall our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. It was  very busy when we arrived but slowed down a bit near the end. We would come back."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  I expected better from a small chain that made good pizza and chopped salads in their other incarnation.  It was not good from the beginning and went downhill from there.  The crab shrimp dip was ok but lacked flavor.  The pita given with it was just plain burnt on the bottom.  The kids angel hair pasta was clumpy and overcooked and the qlwagyu burger was impossible to eat as the bun was soggy and fell apart, the lettuce was bigger than the bun and the onions were not fully caramelized. The burger itself tasted good and that was all I ate. For desert we had the mini donuts. Again these were burnt so badly you could see the black spots.  The sauce was good.  I will say the service was great though and saved this review from being 1 star."}
{"text":"The service was horrible.  Ordered two pizzas and a salad. 35 minutes for the pizzas to arrive, they were room temperature.  The salad took another 25 minutes. Server was non-existent.  Had to ask other servers for drinks and our check.  Disappointing. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Waited a few minutes to be seated, and that pattern continued throughout the meal.  Waited for drink order, waited for food order and waited  for drink refills( my personal hot button issue). The pizza was good, but had to enjoy it without a drink.  Food was good, but poor service distracted from the experience."}
{"text":"The reason why I give this place 5 stars is because our server was amazing. She was very sweet, nice, and understanding. Not only was she checking in on us frequently, she even gave the best suggestions for the food as well. We got the meatballs, tomato basil soup, and the New York pizza. Her name was Naz, I believe, very kinda and beautiful! I will go here again and again if you continue to have people just like her! Thank you again Naz!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants but they had terrible service twice in a row now. After ordering Togo tonight, I have already been waiting an hour. I finally received a cold pizza and when I asked for another one they just put it back in the over. I watched the chef . I asked for another and still continue to wait 30 plus minutes. If I wanted to wait this long I would have dinned in. I don't think I'll be coming back after this experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. Pizza and salads are amazing. Great little bar area in the center. Open walls are great when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Have been here multiple times and really expected much more. Had family in town and really bragged up this place. We called ahead and requested a reservation for 6 at 6pm. Table was ready as promised. Seating was not good. They had us in a large round table half sofa seating. My guests had to use pillows to try and elevate them to the table. Very uncomfortable. 
My son ordered the lobster mac and cheese. It came out in a small bowl, nothing at all special. He swore up and down that it was either artificial lobster or maybe even imitation crab  meat. Very small portion, meat was not very good.
Mom ordered duck tacos. Has had them many times before. Evidently the chefs are being pressured to watch food costs. There was nothing more than a tiny sliver of duck meat on each tack. Very chincey. The service was lousy. We had to ask multiple times for dishes to be removed from the table, drinks to be refilled. 
We are not alcohol drinkers. OUr total bill with tip was $170 for 6 of us. Not one person was blown away by their meal. All of us were disappointed in the quality of food. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We came for Easter Brunch the food didn't come out at the same time although it was good. Our server Dawn was not very friendly and abandoned us after she dropped off the check. We wanted dessert but couldn't get anyone else to wait on us."}
{"text":"I love Garrett, I'll start there. 
I also love the lebni. My friend got me into it and I literally felt myself coming back for not only how awesome Garrett and Amber are, but because I've become obsessed with it! Burrata and pesto pizza is my fave as well as the Greek salad, however my favorite favorite?! Is Garrett and Amber  hands down!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have tried a few items on the menu and it's always just okay. I've tried their pizzas, salads, desserts, variety of appetizers, and I've never had anything that really impressed me. The kobe beef sliders is usually what I go for when I come here because they are probably the best thing on the menu. The last time I went here they had a lot of new items and I was pretty excited about them. I tried the empanadas from the appetizers. Being Argentinian, I was interested in seeing what their interpretation of an empanada would be. Sadly, they were not very good. They were definitely not your traditional empanada. It seemed like they were frozen and heated up in a microwave. Needless to say, I won't be ordering them again. The service here is fantastic though, so I kind of wish their food matched the service. 

A few tips: 
If you want bread, you will have to ask for it. They don't provide it to you otherwise. 
The salads here are huge, even for sharing. I would recommend getting the individual sized salad, even if you are sharing it.
If you have the option, ask the hostess to seat you on the right side of the restaurant. This is where they have huge windows that brings in a lot of natural lighting."}
{"text":"Sammy's was a super last resort dinner spot for us. nothing super spectacular, but good options and nice happy hour. 

But... My boyfriend was on a vendor lunch with work clients and someone in his party found a grasshopper in her salad.

So for that reason, I'm out."}
{"text":"What a disappointing departure from all the other Sammy's restaurants in town.  The food was the same as the other restaurants, but the service was atrocious.  I arrived at the restaurant an hour and a half before closing, but the employees were already working on cleaning and closing up the place instead of paying attention to the customers.  There were ~ 8-10 tables of customers, but only 2 servers that I saw working.  I saw 5 servers sitting at tables busy folding dozens of napkins.  Others were refilling the condiments on the tables. Meanwhile, our server took 15 minutes to initially approach us.  Water took another 10 minutes and tasted like it came straight from the faucet, although our server assured us that it was triple filtered.  One bottle of beer came to our table almost 20 after we ordered it!  Out server brought our food out without any serving utensils (we had to ask for it) and one glass of wine didn't arrive until our meal was almost finished.  Instead of checking us, he was busy chatting with his coworkers. The most insulting part of our meal was the 2 employees who were furiously sweeping the floor around us as we ate.  I wondered how they would like it if I swept dirt up in the air around their food while they ate.  If I ever return to this location, it will be for take out.  It's a shame because the restaurant is very nice, much nicer than the other locations."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed. Food was over seasoned/salty. Meal came cold. Orders came incorrect. Not worth prices at all"}
{"text":"I have been to two previous locations. 
This one is by the the most visually appealing. The lay out is different than all the others. They have a wonderful bar area next to a full glass window wall that opens up, the fresh air is great reminds me of California style restaurants.

Appetizers : Asian style calamari ( very unique) I highly suggest this. 
Hot Rock: 600 degree rock in a bed of salt, and you get to cook your own beef on it. Very tasty and interesting. Also we had Vietnamese crab stack. That was really good and fresh with real crab, and a little lemon grass ginger flavor.

Had a glass of Pinot and the shrimp and grits . Very good, not something I would ever order, I was being spontaneous that day. The waiter suggested it and it was a GREAT suggestion.The grits are not like grits at all, not a single gritty grain actually. Made very well with a stack of steamed greens.

Our waiter was very nice. His name was Zack. Its rare you find people who actually enjoy their job. There is nothing that makes your food taste worst than a fake good mood. We certainly didn't get it with this guy. He is much appreciated, and made my birthday great.

I love the new location, and will be back regularly."}
{"text":"We booked Sammy's for Mother's Day Brunch for my wife, son and I. We've been to Sammy's a number of times before, NYE was the most recent visit, so I was expecting it to be busy. Apparently, the scheduling manager at Sammy's did not! We arrive at 11:15 for our reservation and we're seated quickly. It was clear that they had understaffed. Both managers were running food and there were about 3-4 servers on the floor. It took about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive and after 40 mins our food arrived, cold. Imagine a cold Eggs Benedict and a asparagus scramble, not good. I will never send food back usually, but after that kind of wait, the food had better be good. We returned both our dishes to be remade, after another 20 mins our food arrived and mine was a completely different meal! It was so bad it was laughable. I sent that back and just enjoyed the side of pancakes we ordered. Sure, Sammy's removed the meal from the menu, as expected and none of this was the fault of the server, she was slammed with tables, but it's nothing short of poor management. How do you not staff up for Mother's Day!?! On top of this, the food was bland. Something needs to be reassessed here because with each visit it's getting worse."}
{"text":"Just went for there Asian Chicken salad,and 2 appetizers.....We had great food....And we also had the best waiter named Chris.....He was soooo
nice to us...We are not the youngest anymore ,made us feel so good...We love Sammys....Thank you again Chris......"}
{"text":"The duck taco appetizer is very good. I had the salmon and it was a little better than average but had a lot of sauce. The atmosphere is super cool with a ton of sunlight. They also open the windows when the weather is appropriate."}
{"text":"Kobe Chili is amazing! Service way to slow considering the restaurant was only 20% full. Had to ask for refills, etc.  Chinese chicken salad was spicier than other restaurants."}
{"text":"The seating at this Sammy's is better that the other ones. A little more sit down restaurant vibe. Our server Rachel was very friendly and nice!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  I have been back (since the Yelp event) 4 times!!  The food is so delicious as are the drinks.  I love the non-alcoholic pomegranate drink!!  The gluten free pizza is so much better than most gluten free pizzas and I love how many gluten free options they have!  This place is amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is my closest neighborhood poker bar and I'm giving it another try. 
My latest visit was at the bar in the gaming area and I had the shrimp/crab dip & the red quinoa salad (from the regular menu). I was pleased that the bartender gave me both the happy hour menu and the regular menu WITHOUT MY HAVING TO ASK for the happy hour menu! Kudos.
I was impressed with how cozy the bar area is. The white lights around the bar really make the place comfy. The bar chairs, not so much. 
Back to the food- the shrimp/crab dip was disappointing. If you're gonna feature crab, I better be able to taste it! Not so much here. It was served hot and with plenty of flatbread but the flavor just wasn't there. The salad was excellent and very fresh. Loved the beets & avacado, 
Would have again for sure and maybe try some tapas from the happy hour menu next time.
They have gaming promos such as earn 250 points on Mondays get $20 play next visit."}
{"text":"Went with a couple ladies from the office for lunch..... we decided to order a few appetizers and just share everything!  We ordered the edamame with toasted sesame seeds, truffle fries sprinkled with romano cheese, crispy coconut shrimp skewers served with an orange-horseradish sauce, hummus with grilled herb flatbread, and a margherita wood fired pizza. Everything was great! I 

Really enjoyed the sauce that was served with the coconut shrimp! Loved the way they grilled the herb flatbread that came with the hummus! And of course- the pizza was delicious also! 

Sammy's is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Went with friends who had been there before.  Food was great, prices reasonable, atmosphere wonderful but our server took the trophy home.  Zach was attentive, cordial, even gave us recommendations that were right on.  We will definitely come back time and again.  Kudos to Zach for a wonderful evening and making us feel welcome.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I must say that we had a great experience this time our server Jenna was awesome! Great attitude and excellent service. Food was great as usual and the service top notch this time."}
{"text":"I ate here last night for the first time and loved it! I got a grilled chicken and hummus wrap and it was so delicious.  A perfect blend of flavors!  The service was ok but far from good. The prices were very reasonable.  I will definitely go back for the food!"}
{"text":"Time and time again, I find myself at Sammy's. A unique twist on an old classic, Sammy's is much more than the pizza joint it used to be. The ambience is very unique and the atmosphere is one that none can compare to. There are two sides of the restaurant. One side being the traditional restaurant scenery with booths and tables and the other sides have just the opposite. There are giant windows surrounding the outside of the restaurant giving it an open feeling. The booths and tables have different chairs and set ups than the usual setting. There are plants all around that give this place a one of a kind decor. The food is also nothing short of fantastic. I've been here several times. To my surprise, I find that I enjoy this place more and more every time I stop by. If you're ever looking for something new and different, I would most definitely recommend Sammy's."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place...the bartenders rock and the food is superb! I would recommend this place to anyone in the GV area."}
{"text":"Rachel and Garrett are seriously the best bartenders in Henderson. They know your drinks the minute you sit down and they take wonderful care of you. Love this place."}
{"text":"We've brought out-of-town guests to the Henderson location a couple times and both the food and service is outstanding! Duck tacos, Brussel sprouts, pizza, sliders, salad, wings.....everything is so tasty!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever...............and I have to say I have been to many, many, many establishments in my long life............Was seated in an area with only one other table of occupants.............they had GREAT service............we were ignored.........food was served to another table........no followup........manager brought bill, but made absolutely no comment...........will not EVER try again...........even tho the meal was Fabulous.............too many GREAT servers in this valley...........will take our business elsewhere..........Me thinks not is SO VERY CORRECT!  additional note: mother with 2 children were seated right before we got our bill..........NO ONE Paid any attention to them either.............and the restaraunt was barely busy..............must be trying for the going out of business thing!"}
