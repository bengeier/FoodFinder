{"text":"Had high hopes for this place.  I drive by a lot and was expecting something better than your average greek restaurant.  But, after eating there for dinner on Tuesday night, i have to say it is no better than what you find at the mall.   Service was great and the chicken was prepared fresh.  But unfortunately, it lacked flavor.  Friends ordered the chicken pita and gyro pita combos.  Meat looked dry, salad lacked cheese and fries were fries.   Price was about average.  Menu shows a lot of hot table selection but, there was really nothing left.   Will i come back... probably not.  Not because it was bad, more because of disappointment.  I guess in a way i was expecting too much."}
{"text":"I wish that I had more to say about this establishment, but since I didn't even have a chance to eat, I'm afraid my complaint will be brief. I passed it on my way to the bank on my lunch break and thought I'd give it a shot. I was intent on something fast, yet filling since I only had about 15 mins left. I could see that the staff weren't very engaged and there was no order in terms of placing an order. I waited a few mins while some people chatted amongst themselves in front of me in line, and another customer cut in front of me and proceeded to order. Now, I am not a confrontational person, but if there was some more order, I don't think that would happen. There were people waiting to order amongst those that were just waiting for their food to be ready. Annoyed at the poor service, I left and decided not to order anything. I've seen some bad reviews on this place but thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt...well, I doubt that I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for quick lunch. Glad I did. Fresh Kaiser pulled chicken and pepper sandwich with beef and lamb also. Great service, very tasty. Will have to come back here"}
{"text":"Always come here when I want gyro or chicken souvlaki dinner. The salad that it comes with is so good, sometimes I order a full size salad on the side! I've been coming here for years and years since I was a little girl, and the same person has been serving me year after year. He's super friendly."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and the place is a hit and miss. Service is friendly enough but no one wants to engage in a conversation but they are certainly not rude - they just want to take your order. Its usually quite empty when I go. Food is decent. Sometimes really good. Some time bland. Some times I can't even remember which means nothing to write home about. Your typical fast food lay-out with fast food hygiene and cleanliness BUT not with fast food prices. I would eat there more often if the price point was more accurately placed. Its too expensive for average tasting food."}
{"text":"Have visited the place a couple of times, wasn't impressed even once. Food is very bland."}
{"text":"Can't say I was overly impressed, food wasn't great, everything was so salty that it took me a while to finish. People at work swear by the sandwiches,  but I found the food underwhelming."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Souvlaki dinner special for $10.50 including a drink. Complete meal comes with rice, a pita, potatoes, Greek salad, 2 chicken sticks, and a drink. Food wasn't too bad, chicken and salad were good. The only concern is the overall food preparation. Staff was friendly but wasn't handling my food properly. Definitely cannot be up to code. My chicken fell on the counter and the staff member picked it up and put it in my to go container as if j didn't see it. On top of that there were no gloves being used when preparing my meal to go, and the individuals fingers touched various parts of my meal which grossed me out. Probably won't go back just because of the way my food was prepared it was done VERY sloppy"}
{"text":"Located under a very busy Firkin franchise- this place is facing heavy competition.  However, value wise- Milano will take the win anyday!!  I went in and ordered the Gyros pita sandwich. I'm glad to see a giant slab of meat sitting on the broiler (shawarma machine) and then thick pieces getting cut off to my delight.   I will agree that the texture of the meat did look a  bit dry- however after adding all the condiments and the humongous portion of meat they served. I was very very satisfied.  Is it the most amazing tasting greek food I had - No!  Was it a waste of time and money- No! Will I go back for more Gyro- Yes!  It was a really good sandwich at a really fair price and I am glad I had it."}
{"text":"Had the gyro pita and \"Greek potatoes\" Pita tasted like salt. Potatoes weren't that soft.  Not a good value for $12 (\"premium drink\", a Brio, costed $1)"}
{"text":"The owner seems like he has been beaten down by years of declining numbers.  The product isn't the same as it once was, and prices seem to be on the rise.   There isn't really anywhere else in the area to get a veal sandwich, so I'll continue to go.    I have a feeling this places days are numbered.  Maybe another sandwich chain would have more success here."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly ... However everything else was lacking. Food was extremely disappointing, felt like I was eating boiled baby or old people food. Went with four people, all of our us left unhappy. Sorry guys, waste of money."}
{"text":"The cook is the owner at this establishment and what I really appreciate is the fact this man takes so much pride in his work...so much in fact that one gets the feeling that milano and it's food are his identity. He cares what his customers think of each aspect of his food from the quality of the rice and other ingredients to ensuring that the portions are generous and the price isn't too high....he\"s a proper cook and knows how to make a meal bursting with flavors. definitely have their Philly Cheese Steak meal...for the price range it's one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Ordered the wings and fries combo for the FIFA special, wings tasted like curry and super over cooked!"}
{"text":"Everything was just okay at best. They will have a very tough time competing with Frankie Tomatoes down the road and the Firkin pub right next door."}
{"text":"Currently working temp in the area. So I come by for lunch here and there. On a busy main road so you'll have your left blinker on for a while before you get get into the plaza.   Nice open kitchen, bright green house seating area. Things can get a bit loud during rush hour, but its part of the vibe that makes this place appealing in a way. Friendly service and everyone is addressed. And based on the short conversations the ( owner or head cook ) has with the customers looks like there's a good number of regulars.   Food - went on two different occasions had the Chicken Souvlaki and Greek Fries.   Greek Fries - Believe came up to $5, for a small meal to pass the day its okay. Fries, feta, and dressing. I added hot sauce on top. Got the job done.   Chicken Souvlaki - Having this back to back.... But pretty much your standard. Potatoes, chicken skewer, salad with feta, rice, some triangle flat bread, tzatziki, dressing, and exactly 2 black olives. Chicken was well cooked, seasoned, and plump. Salad was fresh, the veggies were nice and crisp. Good tzatziki, a good amount scooped from a spoon not portioned in a ketchup cup. Overall had a good meal, would buy it again.    Overall cause of the location, offerings, and the food. Would give it a 4/5. If you work in the area or if its on your route good place to grab lunch or dinner. The food is good wont knock your head back but its still good, money spent well."}
{"text":"Bad first time experience!   Driven by multiple times. Thought I stopped by to check it out. Ordered chicken pita wrap. Food was very underwhelming. Chicken souvlaki looked frozen, plain, small, and was pretty expensive for what you get. Not sure  about other items on the menu. Based on what I paid, there are other places with way better food and value in the area.   Will not go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend got me some takeout from here a while back for dinner and it very delicious. Price was low while food portions were large. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for Greek around the area."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. Consistent quality. I always get he veal cutlet, Staff is extremely friendly. I don't come here as often as I like but the boss always recognizes me. I highly recommend coming here for a bite.. lunch or dinner :)   heads up: closed on sundays"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a bunch of coworkers and since we were a large group, we tried to call them ahead of time to see if we could reserve a table. Although it's more of a fast food place, they were pretty accommodating and promised us that there will be seating (there were like 13 of us!). I ordered the chicken souvlaki and it also came with pop. The portion for it was pretty big, it came with the usual rice, chicken, potatoes, salad but also two pieces of pita. Needless to say I was more than satisfied after my meal. The price came up to around $14 so a bit pricier than other fast food places but definitely less than sit-down restaurants. There's not much parking at the front of the restaurant, but if you go near the back there's a whole lot. Overall, would come back to try other items on their specials!"}
