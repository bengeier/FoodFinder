{"text":"Got a home delivery. Quantities are tiny.

The broth of the Pho is pretty good. But the tiny quantities when delivered are rather disappointing. The quality of beef is not that great either. And pho got a little starcy as soon as i put in the noodles. I think they aint cooked well. But one woman's opinion. 

Okay for one time meal that got delivered. I wouldnt order again."}
{"text":"Okay so, I've only ordered from here twice and usually I don't post reviews but someone needs to know how horrible their coffee is. The first time I ordered it the delivery guy accidently spilt it on his way over and I mean ya that sucked and he was complete sorry for it and that's fine, he even took it off the bill for me and was very sweet but the second time I ordered it, I immediately wished he had spilt it again. It smelt like dirty feet and tasted like watered down garbage. Like they were steeping it in water a dirty homeless man just bathed in. How do you mess up coffee? Where are they buying their beans? Horrible. Also, their spring rolls were pretty tasteless and their pho smelt a little funny so i didn't eat it but,on the plus side, I absolutely loved their chowmein. That's probably the only thing I'll ever get from there from now on."}
{"text":"Horrible service...placed an order for delivery and  never made it..when I called for an status, they were rude and yelled at me about NOT knowing where our foods was...He yelled at me about 20% discount and When I asked him when we would receive our food and screamed your order cancelled...BUT only received a 20% discount with NO food...would Not Recommend"}
{"text":"I think this place deserves a much higher rating. My vegetarian pho with added beef was simply delicious, fresh, flavorful. Yes it is an ugly place but the pho I had is my favorite so far."}
{"text":"OK for the price. Not as good as my old spots in OC, but good for Arizona as far as ph√≥ is concerned. The menu has a good amount of options and the restaurant is clean and spacious."}
{"text":"Used a groupon. Overall, I was very happy. From the other reviews I was scarred. First of all, it is 2 restaurants in one building. Go through the green door on the right for Tempe Pho which is the same place as Saigon Pho. It is a casual environment with green walls.  I went there with a friend. We ordered crab wontons first. They were great. She got shrimp pho and I got chicken pho. Both were wonderful. Not many shrimp in the shrimp pho but a good amount of chicken in the chicken pho. Our server was young and helpful woman. No problem using the groupon but I did tell the server I had a groupon when she seated us. I will go back. Nice and fresh. 

On a side note I noticed they had a water pond in the front near the door with red ear slider turtles. I have a red ear slider, he is about 5 years old, and it seemed like the heat lamp was too far away from the turtles. I am not sure the turtles in the pond are getting enough heat and I did not see a UV lamp which they need. The turtle situation can be easily fixed and hopefully it will be. Thanks."}
{"text":"Not recommended. We bought a Groupon to save money and would have much rather spent more money and enjoyed a meal somewhere else.  The service is horrible. Customer service was definitely not the servers area of expertise.  Our drinks came out at two different times. Things that we ordered were forgotten and either weren't remembered or were at the very end of the meal.  We ordered two orders of the spring rolls and only got one. The order that we got was not rolled properly and was very loose, I would not have sent it out.  The pho that I got had items in it that weren't listed on the menu. No thanks, I don't want tripe & if the menu would have indicated it, I wouldn't have order it. I didn't get an apology or asked if I'd like something else. Instead, my father and I switched soups. Good thing my dad likes tripe..ick!
The restaurant closes from 3-5 and two minutes after 3:00 a family came in and the server allowed them in but informed them that she was only allowing them to come in because they were a family. Why would one mention this?  It would be better to have spared the family the rudeness & they could have gotten better food/service elsewhere.  We then saw the server rudely turn away four other parties. Get a sign or lock the door.. 
This experience was not a good one. Me have worked in the industry for years in the past, I left 15% out of respect to the industry, NOT for service. If it were for service, I would have left $1.00. ONE DOLLAR. Don't waste your time... travel to Dobson & Main to UnPHOgettable and get GREAT service & DELICIOUS food!!!!"}
{"text":"I and my friend opted to have Lunch here this week. 

For some reason or another, this place is two restaurants (one Thai, One Vietnamese) running out of the same kitchen but with separate seating rooms and separate doors. The first thing we realized is how hot it was. There was no AC and no fans going at all. It smelt very stale and sticky. 

After waiting for nearly five minutes at the door, a single waitress came around the corner and finally seated us at a booth. It was very shabby, the furniture was falling apart. we were handed two menus each for each of the cuisines/ restaurants? I came for Pho, so I just ordered one with meatballs and brisket. My friend ordered fried rice. 

After waiting 20 min, my friends food finally came out. It was very dry, almost as if over-cooked. But she was so hungry she brushed it off. It was another 10 minutes before my food finally came out. When it did I began to put chili and seasoning into it and picked up my chopsticks before something caught my eye. Looking a little closer, I lifted from the bowl a long rubbery piece of tripe. I was disgusted. the entire bowl was full of tripe. Innards, stomach lining, and intestines may be other people's idea of flavor, but to me it is absolutely awful and repulsive.

After I told the Waitress, she apologized and sent it back to get the correct order. By this time my friend had finished her food and we both awkwardly sat as I waited for my food to come out. During this time, another gentleman in the restaurant also complained about his food. First it was the wrong order, then it was under-cooked. I was already beginning to regret coming in here to eat. After waiting another 10 minutes, my pho finally came out. we had to ask twice for Beansprouts, lime and basil which is staple and supposed to be served alongside. 

Thankful and starving, I picked up my chopsticks finally once again and placed them in my bowl, and poked around my noodles only to realize that it was the SAME bowl of soup, the cook had just picked out the tripe rather than replacing it with the correct order with new noodles and broth. It still had the unpleasant odor of tripe emanating from it as well as some of the chili flakes I had previously placed in before. By now the noodles were soggy and the broth luke-warm. I could barely get through a third of it before I through in the towel. Never in my life have I had to push away a nearly full bowl of pho. It was a shame.

wanting to wash my mouth out of the awful foul tripe taste, I ordered an iced tea. When it finally came, it was so watered down it tasted like tap water. The Sugar packets were chunky and hard, like they had gotten wet and were just put pack to save money.

I decided to swap that out for a soda and ordered a sprite. The young Waitress (who this entire time had been very attentive, very sweet and quite nice to us)  brought it out.  I took one long sip.
It was flat. As flat as flat can be; almost as if from the bottom of a generic brand bottle of cheap soft drink.  It was time to leave.

I would not suggest anyone eat here. Please save your money and your time, and go somewhere good. We will not be coming back. completely awful."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pho!!! I had delivery and it was perfect. Love the noodles and the broth. :)"}
{"text":"Great spring rolls, vegetable tempura, green curry, mushroom soup, and vegetable pho! The server who put our pick up order together was kind and made sure everything was in the bag. Only negative was it took about five minutes more than they initially quoted, but the food was hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Yo I love these guys, I order the egg banh mi all the time and it never disappoints. But I called in the other day and this guy picks up and the funniest convo went down, I ask him if they have birds eye chilly this was what goes down. (im asian btw so this was hilarious imo)

Me: YO SAWADEEKAP, DO YOU HAVE BIRDS EYE CHILLY

GUY: yo hey we don't serve spicy food yo 

ME: HAHAHA do you have jalapenos

GUY: YO we no serve spicy food YO

ME: oh I was wondering if I could get the spice turned up a bit on my uber eats order

GUY: we no speak a lot of english yo, sorry no chilies 

ME: HAHAHAHA sorry thanks bye

I hang up"}
{"text":"Still HUNGRY.  Their sandwiches are such a disappointment we couldn't even finish...very little favor and gross fatty pieces and skin.  We did order Spring Rolls which were good with the peanut sauce.  The service was really slow, we got seated right away but it took several minutes to be offered anything to drink or order. We actually felt ignored most of the time.  Never came back to refill our water.   Our cousin order the PHO with meatballs and found it good but did not care much for the meatballs.  I wanted to like it..."}
{"text":"Tried this place b/c groupon. Service was ok. Food was ok. If I had to pay full price I would have to give it 2 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Yes this place is odd, but the food isn't bad, and you might find the 'off' experience is part of the fun. 

I've eaten here two times (once togo, once dine-in) 
It's a private dining experience, since you're the only one in the entire place. :)

The crab rangoon is great, and the special Pho is worth the $8.95
This place is worth a try, there is also a groupon for the time being."}
{"text":"I got sent to Phoenix for lunch, and I've ordered take out from pho Tempe quite a few times this time I ordered through grub hub, as I called whoever takes the over the phone orders to let them know that I had forgotten to put a few things on grub hub about my order. I was quickly rushed off the phone after only giving half of my information.. so because that happened The grub hub delivery person was not able to find the right hotel and also had the wrong room number which I had given the person who takes it over the phone orders before they sent my order out. When I got my meal which was the lemongrass chicken and also the Saigon noodles the rice was mushy they did not give me the chili lime fish sauce that supposed to come with the Saigon noodles and overall the food was pretty mediocre such a disappointment for something that I was looking forward to. Never eating here again!"}
{"text":"I don't know what was up with those one and two star reviews, and I read a good portion of them,but this was awesome!

I just came back from snowy, windy, cold and wet Baltimore, Maryland today and was really looking for some great pho. I got it. I also didn't need to leasve the house, whoot, whoot!

I got the cooked and raw beef pho, and the simple but flavorful palate was just what I needed- and not too salty!! Yay!

For desert I ordered flan but they were out so a nice guy called me to ask what I would want instead (I got green tea ice cream). He seemed surprised when I paid the difference but it is in my freezer waiting and if the dinner is anything to go by- it shall be woooooorth iiiit!

I also got the Cracker Prawns, a little dark for my taste but also super delicious to tag team my Thai tea with boba. Only downside was that on the ride the ice and boba got scrambled so I had to dig a bit, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Terrible, shady place. First, the hours were different between the door and online, so we thought they were closed. But the door was open, we were starving, and they were more than willing to seat us. We were given two menus (which claimed yet different hours) and we quickly ordered various Vietnamese dishes. They couldn't substitute egg noodles in their Pho for some reason, which is fine, so we asked about their shrimp, meat, and squid dish. They had no squid, and our server said something about fake meat, but we sort of waved it off in anticipation for the food.

They came out with my Bbq pork dish first. It looked normal, but the egg rolls looked a little bizarre. I tried them and I can't really explain the taste. My friend described it as cheesy. It was pretty bad. So after removing that, I noticed that most of the Bbq pork was charred beyond recognition.

It was only at this point, at least ten minutes later, that my friend got her dish, which was a bit disappointing given that we were one of two parties in the place. The dish indeed had no squid, but it did have slimy \"meat\". It also had two pieces of shrimp. Two tiny pieces. That was embarrassing.

We ended our meal with a large pile of discarded egg rolls, \"meat\", and fairly bland noodles. I would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Great experience overall! Ordering through Yelp was a breeze. Took a bit of time to confirm the order, but that's okay (I'm talking about 5 minutes). Wait time was like 20 minutes maybe. It was all ready when I arrived. It was little confusing where to go/who & how to get the pick up from, but it was easily remedied. Food was great. Great price. They have some adorable turtle in their waiting area."}
{"text":"I will never get food here again. I ordered online and after an hour called the store to see if my food was on the way. The man said it would be there in ten minutes,  it took another hours. That would have been forgiven if the food had been any good, or even what it was supposed to be.  I ordered the pho with rare beef and well done brisket and an order of spring rolls. The spring rolls were soggy and the \"beef\" pho was chicken stock with a spice powder sprinkled on top. Save your money, eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I have experienced and will experience. They have this poor woman running in circles helping tables and about 4 uber/doordash drivers. I have been sitting here waiting for my CHECK for 30 minutes. The kitchen can't produce food in a timely manner. Holy cow. The food did not make this worth it at all! How sad. Hopefully they get it together."}
{"text":"I don't quite know how to describe our visit to Saigon Pho. My husband and I couldn't decide what to do for dinner so we crawled through some yelp and groupon deals and decided on pho. We like pho. So off to Tempe we went. 

We were greeted by green walls, a turtle pond, and the owner who directed us to our booth. \"We have Vietnamese food here,\" she said. Yes, I know. I came here for your Vietnamese food. We ordered Thai iced teas and were prepared to order our meals, but after we ordered our drinks she left her notepad on our table and left. Oh, okay. 

A waiter (her son) came to our table to deliver the Thai iced teas, which were good, and to take our order. I ordered the chicken pho and my husband ordered the beef pho. We also got the crab Rangoon. 

He came back with our crab Rangoon... And also a British accent. What? Yes. He had completely changed his accent from perfectly American to straight up Brit. The couple in the lobby putting in a to go order noticed it as well. \"Where are you originally from?\" They asked. \"Colorado Springs.\" He said. Oh...

Back to the food. The crab rangoons came out. They were pretty good. A little sweet for my taste. The sauce was really runny though, like it was watered down. He also brought our side plates of fun things to put in our pho, including bean sprouts, mint sprigs and jalape√±os. And lemons. 

Our pho came out. Mine had what looked like shredded chicken from a rotisserie chicken in it, my husbands had grey beef and tripe in it (though no tripe was ordered).We had both asked for a level 3 heat in our soups, but neither were spicy, or very flavorful. This is when I reached for the condiment tray, to add some sriracha and chili paste. It seemed that none of the bottles had ever been wiped down - they were grimy and sticky to the touch. I went to pour a little soy sauce into the broth - IT WOULDN'T POUR OUT OF THE BOTTLE. But, I digress. 

We mentioned we had a living social deal to pay. It seems that they have used several of these services to drum up business, as the table next to us had one as well. They were not excited about us using the living social deal that they had decided to sign up for in the first place. Begrudgingly, without speaking, the owner took our check and hand-wrote the new total. We put our credit card in the book. The waiter came back and asked us if we wanted more water or to-go boxes. We said no thank you. He left without taking the check. We waited five minutes for him to come back to ask if we wanted water again so we could pay and leave. 

We left with our stomachs feeling full but uncomfortable. I looked longingly across the parking lot at Ted's, certain that a corn dog would have been more satisfying than this disaster."}
{"text":"Having lived in rural areas or small towns for so long, I forgot how great it was order food to be delivered at home. Had a couple friends visiting and one got sick so we ordered Pho. It was OK, not the best, but certainly not bad. It was really easy to order through Yelp and I was able to tip, too."}
{"text":"After a week of planning to go out for pho for lunch with some coworkers, Groupon offered a pretty good deal for Saigon Pho.  It was situated in an eclectic strip mall including a Smart and Final, Ted's Hot Dogs, Beaver Choice and a dry cleaners.  It's probably easily overlooked.  That said, once we walked in we all commented on the ambiance; it was definitely asian, and the restaurant had a very quaint feeling about it.  It's very comfortable.

I quickly noticed some of the interesting drink choices: Thai iced tea (which I love, and was surprised to see in what I originally thought was a Vietnamese restaurant), coconut milk served straight from the coconut and Vietnamese coffee.  I chose the former, but the other two looked awesome.

When I started looking through the menu, I realized there's a combination of Vietnamese and Thai food.  We all ordered pho, since that's why we were there, and it was pretty good.  I got the brisket and rare steak pho, and I didn't feel like there was quite as much meat as I've had at other places.  The broth was comparable, though I added sauce to this one where I usually don't.  We also had an order of spring rolls, which were delicious.

The service was friendly, albeit a tad slow.  Everything was priced right on par and would have been reasonable even before the Groupon.  The one sad part was that the manager would not accept a bill that was torn as payment (it was a big tear, but it certainly wasn't in half).

If I was in the area, I'd probably come back for pho and to try the coffee.  I don't think I'd go out of my way though."}
{"text":"Meat tender, delicious meat balls and broth was good! The spicy is was just good. The springs rolls are ok! But this will be a 5 star if the waitress didnt approach me while I was eating for 4 time. And it was just to talk to me not to see how was everything. I just wanted to eat my lunch. Other than that its great food. This will be my pho in Tempe area"}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to try this place because it delivered. Pretty cool huh? Not! Instead of it being 45 minutes it took two phone calls and an hour and a half to get our food. When it finally got there it was semi warm and the Pho I ordered had 3 pieces of beef and the flavor was not at all what I expected. My daughter's had some unidentifiable pieces of pork(?) that looked kind of like thin shaved bone and were very hard. The Boba we each ordered was hard and totally disgusting. The price for the quality of food was ridiculous $32 for two entr√©es and two Bobas. I will not be ordering from them ever again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Papaya Beef salad and received Papaya noodles, soggy lettuce, mushy tomatoes and green beans. Grubhub called the restaurant to request a refund and the manager would only offer a 10% discount for the missing beef. That was $0.87. The food was disappointing and the service even worse. Plenty of Vietnamese restaurants to choose from, skip this one and avoid Grubhub for delivery as they did little to advocate for the customer."}
{"text":"Ok so this is a overall experience rating...
I've been here a couple times and its usually always dead. Maybe one other diner. I understand that consistency is not always on point here, but damn I believe they deserve a overall higher rating. At least for the food alone. I had pho today, and it was very fresh, very tasty, and veggies were also fresh. Seems like the server was also cooking, and the restaurant could use a makeover and lighting overhaul. But overall, the pho is good. And I can't really say I've had the horrible experience some other people have had here. Hey they deliver pho in the area, not many pho places do that. Uh oh I think there's MSG in the broth. My stomach is uncomfortably expanding."}
{"text":"UPDATE: last time I ordered from this place, I was very very disappointed. I'm not sure what changed, but something did. My pho broth had a weird perfumey taste, and the chicken was old tasting. Vegetables were NOT fresh, basil was black on the edges and bean sprouts limp. The delivery guy took an hour and a half, so my warm food was cold and my spring rolls were warm. They forgot sauce for my crab puffs and peanut sauce for my rolls. I could overlook any of these individually but having such a bad experience I can't not update this review. It was so bad I dumped my soup down the garbage disposal and I was so grossed out by it being possibly expired/bad food I didn't eat much of the rest of it. I put the spring rolls in the fridge and ate them later. Had a stomach ache for 2 days. I thought about calling and asking for a refund, but not worth it. 
I'm done with this place. 


This review is from a pho snob, I do NOT understand why this place has bad reviews.
I have eaten the following things from this place: chicken pho (pho ga), rare beef pho (pho tai), spring rolls, and crab puffs.
I have only ever gotten delivery because I work from home and on busy days don't have time to leave my desk.
Orders always take about 45 minutes. Since I know this- I order a bit before I am starving. I have two big rescue dogs so I always have them leave the order outside the door. I always tip 20% as well, and have had nothing but amazing service and hot orders. (Tip people- it's not hard)
The pho ga is some of the best I have ever had. So good. Plenty of meat and the broth is an amazing deep flavor. I spice mine up with a big spoonful of sambal and extra lime. It's heaven in my mouth. I have eaten pho at well over 100 different places on the west coast and this pho ga gets a 9.8 out of 10.
The pho tai is good but it weirds me out getting it to go. I prefer eating rare meat that hasn't traveled. 
Spring rolls and crab puffs satisfy my cravings, but aren't anything special. This review is for the pho and the delivery service.
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Interior is terrible... the fish tank looked disgusting and the little turtle pond was creepy. I called in and placed an order for my friend and I and was told to come in 20 minutes to pick up the food. 20 minutes later I arrive and tell the server that I called in an order. She then asks what I ordered, writes it down on paper, and tells me it's going to be another 15 minutes...... literally four other customers inside the dingy restaurant. I would recommend any other pho place above this restaurant. Seriously."}
{"text":"Orders delivery through Prime Now. It's exceptionally hard to understand how places can screw up your orders nowadays, given the fact that with online orders the order is right in front of you. Well, somehow Pho Tempe managed to only get about 25% of our order correct. The food that came was satisfactory, but most of it wasn't what we ordered. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for shrimp pho, spring rolls, and egg rolls. Everything was hot, fresh, and delicious but it took FOREVER. I made the mistake of not just driving to pick it up but I felt like they took advantage of their 60 minute time. Pizza comes faster."}
{"text":"No no no! Don't eat here!!! The spring rolls were gross! Little meat, wilted lettuce!! The shrimp pho had browning vegetables. Didn't even eat it!! No stars!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what these other reviewers were expecting...  Have I had better? yes!  I've definitely had better.  First time I ordered it was the vegetarian pho and I felt it lacked some flavor but it was still good, it wasn't lacking in ingredients, just a plain broth.  I'll admit, I ordered delivery and have never been inside the restaurant, but if an undesirable color scheme is THAT much of an issue for you, you've got some serious problems.   It's not my favorite restaurant but these reviews are ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the older woman who I assume is the owner was extremely friendly and helpful.

The young server has no place in a Vietnamese restaurant as she doesn't know what the food is, and is just plain all over the place.

I'll be returning here."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Ordered vegetarian pho and it was alright. Crab wontons were bland. Nothing special about this place but nothing horrible either."}
{"text":"This place sucks!  I went there with someone and we ordered our appetizers at the same time.  Theirs came out 10 minutes before mine (they ordered fried wonton things, I ordered wings) and I can't for the life of me figure out why mine took so long as they weren't even fully cooked!
Then, when we ordered our entrees, we each ordered the same one.  Well, theirs came out.  Mine didn't.  We waited, and waited, and waited.  Finally, the obnoxious old woman (who was rude the whole time, not to just us, but to her own staff as well) came and asked how the one dish was.  I asked where mine was and she was exasperated...because, y'know...two people are going to order only one dish.  So, they scrambled and another ten or so minutes went by before they brought out mine.  Mine was terrible.  It was undercooked and the lettuce it was served on had a large rotted spot on it and they didn't even bother to trim it or use fresh vegetables.  This place is awful.  If there was a negative rating, I'd do that.  In fact, I opened a Yelp account just to voice my opinion of this place.
I miss Papaya Thai.  I used to eat there frequently and this new version of the restaurant is deplorable.  Seriously.  Avoid this place.  The food is terrible and the staff is rude.  The new owners should commit seppuku.  I try and support local businesses but this place deserves to be closed."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything worse than the food here. Like the others, I found myself here late at night when most of the other restaurants were closed . Had their rice dish and saying it was bad is being gentle . Never been to a Viet/Thai place. Perhaps the Thai options are better? Safe to say you won't find me back here. Weird smell. Pretty dirty and I don't believe they have A/C."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I order from this place all the time and keep ordering only because it's the only place that delivers Pho in my area. I ordered tonight and after an hour and a half of waiting for my delivery, I call and ask where my food is and got a very unapologetic response of \"15 more minutes okay bye\" and hung up on me. Ridiculous service. Also they never ever bring chopsticks, who eats pho without chop sticks? Won't be ordering from them again! Ps: your pho sucks. 
Update: it's now been 2 hours and still waiting on my delivery."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here twice. Once we went to their sister Papaya Thai restaurant (attached) this time for their Saigon Pho (Vietnamese) restaurant. 

The service was truly awful. I used to manage a bar, was a waiter and bar tender. So I have a l of patience for servers. We were the first ones in the door. Our orders were taken within the first 5 minutes...then another waitress came around to take our orders again. It was hitting the 25 minute point at this time. We ordered spring rolls for an appetizer (which we had to remind them we ordered and then they finally brought them out). 

I ordered a sausage and shrimp fried rice mix. Which was ONE shrimp with maybe 4 or 5 pieces of shrimp. My wife ordered some pho and it was really low on broth.  We both ordered a drink because the water is not filtered. I ordered a black boba tea and she ordered a ginger/pineapple smoothie. The darn straw wasn't big enough for the bobas...which kind of defeats the point :(. Her smoothie was good though.

All and all It took us about an hour and a half to get in and out of there. There were 6 other tables that came in (4 couples and two groups of 4.) They came in spaced pretty evenly and it seems like many other customers had trouble with their orders.

Portion sizes were...ok. Not huge, not small, they could be a little less cheap with the meat. The service was REALLY lacking. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Decided to come in tonight for dinner. The food was good, service was good, and prices were reasonably. There are two menus consisting of Thai and Vietnamese food. I thought my pho was great. I don't understand the poor reviews! Try it yourself before you judge this place!"}
{"text":"I got take out pho delivered through uber eats. It was on time but luke warm. I don't know how to say this other than it just wasn't good pho as many of the other reviews have stated. It tasted like tap water with a little chicken broth. I loaded it up with sauces which I had specifically requested extra of but they failed to provide more than the minimum. I ended up rummaging through my own fridge to find ANYTHING to put in it. I made it edible with some terriyaki sauce I found. The chicken was actually delicious fresh all white meat but not enough of it. I wouldn't go back here BUT it was the ONLY place open at night that delivered so I would try it again simply because of their great hours and delivery services."}
{"text":"I went to(now Pho Tempe) using a Groupon that was expiring the same day.  After reading such scathing reviews I was tempted to not go.  I'm glad I took a chance.  The server was very nice, attentive, and didn't bat an eye when I presented our Groupon.  Our spring rolls were delicious and served promptly, as were the crab wontons.  They don't skimp on the stuffing in the wonton stuffing either.  Lots of cream cheese.  Some people have expressed dissatisfaction with the sweet n sour sauce's thin consistency.  I enjoyed it very much.  It isn't the typical bowl of corn syrup with a ton of red food coloring, but a light, sweet/tangy sauce with slivers of crispy carrot for added texture.  Our entrees were generous portions, and made for delicious left-overs.  The condiment bottles on the table were clean, as were the forks in the glass some people complained about.  I don't know why people think this is a strange practice.  Many restaurants do this.  It makes it convenient to grab additional forks, soup spoons, or chopsticks as needed.  I dined with my 10 year old son who is definitely now a fan of Vietnamese food and this restaurant.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a groupon thinking we would try out somewhere new. 

This place was... okay. I really wanted to like it because I like to support local businesses, and the only person who appeared to be working there (an older woman), was very nice.

First we ordered drinks, I usually only get water at any restaurant I go to and that's all I wanted to get because I knew I was getting dehydrated, but I also wanted to make sure we used the full value of the groupon ($24 worth of food and beverage). I asked for thai tea with boba, and some water. The water never came, the thai tea didn't taste right, and there was no boba, although there was coconut jelly cubes on top. Unfortunately I hate coconut jelly cubes. My friend asked for a green tea smoothie, which does not come with boba. It tasted like blended ice, there was no flavor. He also had the weird coconut cubes on top of his drink, and both drinks were charged as having boba despite that no boba was ever present.

The appetizer was decent. I liked it, but it's a little hard to ruin fried food. We had the pineapple cheese wontons, they were served with sweet chili sauce. We really enjoyed it, so we were optimistic about our pho.

There weren't very many options for meats on the menu, so I ordered brisket and the rare beef, while my friend had only the rare beef. When the pho arrived, we were excited. It smelled delicious, but we realized we didn't have any of the small dishes for mixing the sauces. So we improvised and used the plates our bowls were sitting on. The broth was great, but the noodles were oddly clumpy and stuck together, something I'd never witnessed in any of the many bowls of pho (both amazing and terrible) I've had. I also noticed that there was far less meat than in any bowl I've had before.  The bowls looked exactly the same and both had only 4 pieces of meat.

I won't go out of my way to go here, but I also won't make it a point to never attempt this place again. It wasn't anything special, but it was \"just okay\"."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong! I even ordered by giving them the number of the selection and pointed directly to the entree which is the safe way to order things in non native English speaking restaurants and they still made me something on a completely different page! Wtf?! Also they barely give you any of the things you want in your order!  They give you barely any meat, barely any seafood, the shrimp pieces despite being labeled \"jumbo\" are mere tiny pieces of shrimp. This place is as stingy as they come people! Also, they take FOREVER! To get my food out. I only ordered noodle soup. It takes other pho restaurants less than 5 minutes to make it. Mine here however took 35 minutes including making the wrong order first. On top of it some other things wrong: they did not give me any napkins, their forks felt dirty, my noodle soup barely had any noodles or meat and looked like someone ate half of it and then gave it to me! Not to mention the bowls are tiny to begin with. And the worst thing?! They put pork in my beef noodle soup! First they got it wrong and second time they got the dish right but they put meat I don't eat in. Hello?! I ordered beef soup not pork soup.

Tho the waitress got my order wrong, and it took forever, she quickly apologized and made me the right entree without giving me shit about it. Whenever I asked for something she was nice. So service is hospitable tho not very accurate. But even after all this I cannot say I would be happy coming back here again. I wouldn't even sadly come back here. Sorry this place sucks balls!"}
{"text":"Saigon Pho.  My favorite!

My husband and I love this place.  I always get the #2 (Summer rolls) and #41 (seafood rice noodle)  YUM!  My Mr. C always gets the beef salad (not sure of number) which is also great.   My sister in law and father in law always get the #10 pho. (I haven't had it yet)  I decided to switch it up and get  Bun this time.  Bun is sort of a noodle salad dish and is great!!

I've NEVER been disappointed by Saigon!"}
{"text":"For the bowls being smaller than other places I would think the prices would be too, but they are not."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible. First, the service was incredibly slow. There were two tables and two servers, yet we waited many times throughout the meal. Water refills took 12 minutes! I ordered a boba drink and got mysterious clear and gritty boba, complete with a large piece of plastic wrap, yes plastic wrap. The table behind us (the only other table) sent back their rice, as it was served in a dirty bowl.  The food was less than flavorful. We will never be back. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place."}
{"text":"You know, I really appreciate the fact that they took me in late at 9:05pm, when they were about to close. In fact, I found the info on Yelp stating they would be opened until 10pm. I was hungry and craving for Pho, when all of the neighbor Pho joints were closed. Since that moment, I knew I was making a mistake. Pho Dac Biet was small, but contained a lot of meat, and I did not like the broth one bit. Broth tasted like boil water mixing with fish sauce and Knorr, and I am being serious!Being unhappy with the food, I started to judge every thing else: restaurant is dark with weird smells, no AC - just a fan blowing, mosquitoes were flying around, no music, and Politic News on TV. I wonder why they have such good reviews?

When I'm hungry, I can eat anything. But since I know the Pho tastes that bad, I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Got delivery (of spring rolls and Shrimp Pho) to my office in Central Phx, was on time, delicious and people stopped by my desk to tell me how good it all looked and smelled. Definitely ordering from here again on the days I dont want to drive for lunch!"}
{"text":"Good was great and so are the prices. Not sure why people are rating it so low. It's a mom and pop place that cooks fresh food. All in all I hope this places doesn't  close down. It's a new favorite"}
{"text":"This is the WORST experience I have ever had at a restaurant ever! I went to this restaurant because I had a Groupon for this establishment and I was actually kind of excited to try put a new place close to home. Forget about it. A simple lunch service should be pretty staight forward but there was only one flustered server, getting water was a triumph. Two hot green teas and bbq chicken bahn mi orders were placed. 20 mins went by we tried to cancel the tea we got the comment that it was\" already brewing\". It wasnt any fancy tea, just plain old packets of Jasmine green tea. Im pretty sure they just didnt want us to deminish our tab. Finally our sanwiches arrived. Absolutely disgusting. The bread was soggy because they were sitting there. The supossed grilled barbeque chicken was cold and hard and resembled old shredded chicken. We waited forever for absolute garbage. On top of all that it was an ordeal to use the Groupon."}
{"text":"Here's my tempe pho verdict: it's open at all the right times- late and Sunday's. It's sketchy looking as phok, but the pho is undeniably delicious. Salty, fragrant, flavorful. The beef is soft, though scarce, and tasty. Always get \"to go\" because the place quite honestly is pretty gross (turtles are cute but probably salmonella-ey). I wouldn't be surprised if I got sick eating here, but I wouldn't stop eating here.
Beef pho: 4.5 stars
Place: 1 star"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Pho Tempe from grub hub. Deliver took longer that estimated time. That wasn't the bad part. 
I got the rare beef pho, the pineapple and cream cheese wontons, and a Thai boba tea.
The pho was not even warm. I had to microwave the broth when I received it just so my beef would cook. The noodles are not the pho noodles I am used to. The broth is not very flavorful. It was nice that they gave me enough pho fixings but not nearly enough sauce to give it the flavor it needed. 
The wontons were delicious. I just wish they were warm. 
The boba tea was the only thing that met my expectations. It was a large size and delicious.
Wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"The portion of the Pho wasn't very much but it  was decent flavor. I was in the area so i decided to give it a try . The customer service wasn't that great either and there was only 3 people in the establishment."}
{"text":"I only gave this place a star because yelp wouldn't let me keep it blank. We were told to go here after pho bamboo declined serving us due to being \"closed\" at 9:23pm even though their sign said open and their hours on yelp AND their website say 10am-midnight Sunday-Saturday. We drive to pho Tempe and it's closed.... after we were just told they'd be open til midnight from pho bamboo. Don't go to either."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I'm starting to order from them regularly.  Their seafood dishes are awesome, especially the Tofu Fish with tomato and ginger sauce...  so good."}
{"text":"Came here after my friend saw some foul stuff at Pho Nhat on Apache and this place definitely made up for that incident. Food here at Pho Tempe was perfect. We were the only ones in there so everything came quick. The egg rolls were so good and my pho was amazing I'll def go back soon."}
{"text":"Strange, strange place. Shares kitchen with Papaya Thai. Had a Groupon and decided to try it out. 
We ordered spring rolls and crab wontons... Not bad. Then moved on the chicken pho, which I enjoyed. My husband ordered chicken and shrimp noddles with 5 spice level. Was surprised to get shrimp pho. The plate that came out next was awful... No shrimp and it tasted like grease.

Very disorganized for only 4 tables. No bueno. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a new pho spot to try out nearby and happened to find this place. 

We walked in and the waitress just looked at us and sat us down at a table, she didn't greet us or anything. Once we sat down she came by to give us the menu and the menu was for Thai food. We could have sworn we walked into a pho restaurant because the picture outside clearly stated it was a pho restaurant. Anyway, we just sat there for about 10 minutes while our waitress was eating with another worker. She then came by and asked what we wanted to drink and we asked if there was pho here. She didn't say anything but take our \"Thai\" menus away and came back with the Vietnamese menu. To sum things up .... She never came back to take our order after that, so we left. 

Boooo ... Customer Service was terrible! I'll never recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"HorribleA people!!! Rude for no reason. Wouldn't tell me how much catering is. Wouldnt give me a menu. I was the only person in there. The only one besides the guy sweeping and the lady act like I was bothering her when I just had a question. First time there and I left without ordering anything and will never be back."}
{"text":"I waited like 15 minutes to be seated as there was no one to be seen. This place is split in two with one side being Vietnamese cuisine and the other side being Thai cuisine. I went around and checked out the cool aquarium tanks that they had. They had two tanks; one for turtles and koi and another one on the Thai side that had a pretty legit eel and some tropical fish I presume. This wasn't the first time I've eaten here but it's been probably a year or two since I've last been here.

The waitress was in the back working in the kitchen with ear plugs on as she was blending stuff with a blender. My buddy got her attention and we were seated. After ordering cha gio and our pho orders, she brought us waters. The appetizers, being the cha gio or fried egg rolls, came out relatively fast. Shortly after, the pho bowls came. I had gotten a beef pho with everything in it. It was pretty decent. The cha gio were decent. All around, not bad."}
{"text":"Order Pho to be picked up. Glad they are open till a little later than other places. Food tasted good and price was affordable.

The restaurant isn't in the best condition. I'll not recommend this place to dine in but it's ok for a late meal pick up.
My suggestion will be work in restaurant appearance to drive customers to dine in."}
{"text":"If you know your pho this is not the place for you. They had a super limited selection, and the portions were small. I was really upset they didn't have anything with tendons or tripe. The broth was pretty good but everything else was sub par. Service was also pretty bad... there are a lot of places near by that are way better."}
{"text":"Trickery - this restaurant is now called Pho Tempe but used to be Saigon Pho... and it's still only 2 stars. 

We went tonight and ordered 3 things. Since it claims to be Thai and Vietnamese, we ordered Pad Thai noodles, Pho Chin, fried rice and Thai tea. You'd think that at least something was good but nope, none of it was good... other than the Thai tea. 

They delivered the smallest bowl of weak broth pho I've ever seen (with only 3 pieces of meat). It arrived 10 min before the rest of the food arrived, with no spoons. The Pad Thai noodles, which are normally a dryer noodle, were swimming in sauce , had very little chicken, and had no peanuts (wth?).  The fried rice was... interesting.  My dad said he thought it was decent but wouldn't reorder it.  The rest of us didn't like it.  

But the worst part was the TV. The movies playing had had curse words, people puking (not kidding) and tons of violence... That's definitely not appropriate while my 3-year old, retired parents and I were trying to eat. Since there were other kids there, too, I ask them to change it.  They changed it from an F-bomb movie to the movie that had vomit scenes... Nice. Then they wouldn't change it on my 2nd request so my toddler got an eyeful all through dinner. We almost got up at left at this point. Put a cooking show or the travel channel on the TV! Then you'll have something appropriate for all ages and tastes to watch.

The Thai tea was good and the interior looks nice but my parents said to watch out for the bathrooms. 

I was trying to get my culinary conservative parents into Viet food since my fianc√©, toddler and in-laws are all Vietnamese but this restaurant was a big disappointment.  

Definitely won't see you there (especially when Khai Hoan is right down the road)."}
{"text":"Now called Tempe Pho.  Changed the name to get away from the bad reviews?  

Found the Groupon and was hoping to find a Pho restaurant that is closer to home than DaVang but as good.   The environment was nicer, but one of my menu pages was super grimy which doesn't set the expectations very high since we were the only patrons.  The 2 ladies (waitress and ??) could have been cleaning the menus or the gunky sauce tops (condiments on the tables) while they had extra time.

To the food.  My husband liked the flavor of his pho (#18) , but pulled out the meatball and the tripe(?).  My bun (#22) was good and I enjoyed it.  However, $9.95 was pricey for some pork and noodles.  Wasn't partial to egg roll.  

Spring rolls were made fresh since I requested shrimp only.  I agree with prior reviewer lettuce w/o veggies make for a boring spring roll.  Sprouts and cucumber add a nice crunch.  Really missed the mint that Davang puts in theirs for 1/2 the price.  

Do NOT get the lemonade.  Not good, seemed to have chunks of powder in the bottom and they charge you $3.50.  Really?? for powder in sparkling water?  

If I wasn't a fan of Davang's flavor and price...I might have like this better.  
Disappointed...not repeatable."}
{"text":"I ate here last week. They have amazing spring  rolls. I ordered from Uber eats and this restaurant impressed me. I didn't look it up on yelp like I usually do. I can't understand why this place has low stars. I had the most moist chicken fried rice. It had juicy white chicken pieces and the rice wasn't super dry like most non-chain restaurants fried rice can be. Their chicken pho here is delicious too. They give you an abundance of fresh veggies and quality noodles for the pho. Their broth isn't too salty and it really helped my cold. 


I made the mistake of ordering from a different Thai place this evening with higher ratings just to see, and instantly regretted it. I will order for here from now on. It just proves to show you that not every yelp review or stars is accurate"}
{"text":"Despite the previous reviews my coworkers and I decided to order for delivery and I understand why this restaurant received bad reviews. They took a little over a hour to deliver and still missed an item from our order. The food wasn't very seasoned and I've definitely had better. They were over priced and barely provided any meat for our meals. My first impression of this restaurant is a FAIL. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Don't know why people give this place 1 star, must've came on an off day, the pho and pork were spot on. The service was amazing too! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered just one order of shrimp spring rolls and the vermicelli noodles were dry and either undercooked or old. The service also leads something to be desired, and I feel like there are only two people working at any given time. Try the Vietnamese restaurant on Apache instead."}
{"text":"This was the worst pad Thai I've ever ordered. It had absolutely no flavor and only a few pieces of meat. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited Saigon Pho on a LivingSocial coupon.  Have to agree with the others how weird this place is.  The lady asked us if we wanted Vietnamese food which is beacause of the shared Thai and Vietnamese food sign.  The decor is strange as well.  Leopard seats, bright green paint, turtle pond.  We thought the pho was good.  Soup was fragrant and a fair amount of seafood was given.  We also had mango ginger drinks.  At first when the drinks came out, it hardly looked blended.  The cook forgot the ginger so back it went.  When it came out the second time, it looked fine.   While I might try this place again, there are so many other choices."}
{"text":"First time I've been to this place. Normally my boyfriend and I go to Saigon in Chandler where we are regulars. The service was pretty good there. We had several people that checked on us which was really nice. 

The atmosphere was interesting. They had a fountain with large fish and turtles. The fountain was unsightly only because it was very unfinished. 

The food itself was okay. We ordered pho Thai and Thai teas. The pho has some pretty thick slices of meat which was nice. The broth was chicken flavored which we do like but it was lacking its usual flavor. If reminds me a lot of plain chicken broth but more milky. 

The Thai teas were interesting. When we first got them, we swear they tasted like orange cream sickles. Very fruity. They remade the drinks which was good of them. They tasted more like Thai tea the second time around. However, the tea flavor was almost lost. It was extremely sweet and had lots of creamer. 

I don't think we'd go again."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  My husband and I were looking for a good pho place on a rainy day, so we decided to try this place out.  We walked in to find green plywood walls and leopard print seats and a fish tank.. We ordered the #2 spring rolls, which were actually pretty good and larger than you'd normally find.  I ordered the shrimp pho which was sub par.  My husband wanted the beef stew, and there were 2 items on the menu that said beef stew, so he asked the waitress and she said yes #19 spicy soup is beef stew. When he got the soup it was a clear broth with pieces of gray meat. The beef stew he usually eats has a reddish broth so he asked her if this was the beef stew and she said no. She proceeded to tell him that next time he \"needs to speak clearly\" (even after he tried to confirm with her). We will never be back."}
{"text":"Maybe I came on a good day. I usually rate restaurants on what they're supposed to be known for. The Pho here is decent. The broth, in particular, is the highlight. In fact, I finished the whole bowl! The noodle and the beer & brisket was average at best. 

The other pho place at the Mekong Plaza in Mesa is much better but Pho Tempe opens a bit later. I'd come back only for proximity reasons and if UnPhogettable is closed."}
{"text":"So first time order from here through GrubHub. I'm sick and live just 3 miles away, but still took an hour and half to arrive. Called at 20 min past quoted arrival. Rude person indicated that the driver had left then practically hung up on me. Please note my order was 5:47 pm on a Monday. Traffic might be a bit crazy but there's no way that should have taken another 20 min or so after that. Ok so the food. Got the rare beef and well done brisket. Literally 2 pieces of the rare beef and 4 tiny brisket slices. Now pho isn't exactly the meatiest soup and this was about $8 off the menu. Get extra beef. The broth was very good. I expected to hate on the broth but it was great, and my sickly self needed it. Wasn't into their egg roll. I've had this many other Vietnamese places and this had an unusual ingredient that felt like shredded cooked potato which I don't think it was, but made the texture inside off. Nice and crispy on the outside though, so definitely not all bad. Overall, if I order here again I'll plan for completely ridiculous delivery time, get extra broth and extra meat, skip the egg rolls but I will only order here if I'm too sick to leave the house again. So yeah, not terrible food but disappointing service."}
{"text":"Definitely a weird dinning experience. The food has some potential but I had to stop eating half way fearing that I might get sick. My boyfriend barely touched his food. The place has a strong smell and all the furnitures are definitely old and outdated. The server was really nice to us so we left him a nice tip but def will not come back again."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Restroom could use a cleaning. Overall experience was C rating. We had pho and two spring rolls. I've had better service and food at Unphogetable in Mesa. While they tried to create a good experience , it was lacking and for those reasons I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOO STARS IF I COULD!!!!!!!!!!

So Like most of you on here I like to eat, and I know what I like.

I ordered  one day and the food was wonderful.

But..........

Three days later I ordered the same thing except added an order of orange chicken for another guest.

When we ordered we asked the gentleman who had an Asian accent if they even had orange chicken (which I thought would be weird), and without hesitation the man said \"Yes\".
 When the food arrived before I even took a bite, I knew something was not right.

The shrimp fried rice was waaaaaaay over cooked like mush. I ordered extra shrimp which was non existent. The spring rolls I ordered had nothing in them but shredded lettuce and like 3-4 itty bitty pieces of julienne carrots.

It was so obvious that this wasn't the same food I started wondering if somehow they delivered someone else's food, when I looked in the bag there was a menu from another restaurant called Papaya Thai.  When I saw that I completely freaked out and and called to ask what the hell was going on.

I was advised that there is two restaurants one Thai and one Vietnamese, because I ordered an order of orange chicken my food was made at the Thai restaurant...NOT OK. You don't order or go to an establishment and order one thing and get something else.

I was apologized to by who I assume was an owner and then told I would have 1 free meal......1, even though my order was completely botched and I spent over $50. It was late and after working 9 hours I didn't even care anymore so we threw the food away and we ordered something else for delivery.

3 DAYS later.

I have a brilliant idea to order again and give it another try...DUMMIE.

My 2 orders of shrimp fried rice had 1 shrimp in only one box, my spring rolls were OK, but my shrimp fried rice had stuff in it that was never in the shrimp fried rice I had even ordered before (both times).

This time my boyfriend called and complained and the owner said it was his own fault he messed up our order and that he would comp us two more meals next time we ordered.

HELL NO.... 
We said no, and that we would even bring the food back for a full refund, there was no way we will ever eat here again ever, two free meal would be no use to us. The same gentleman advised us it was not necessary to bring the food back and that if we came in we would get our refund.

So, when my boyfriend goes in there for our money the owner tries to give us $12.... Finally after saying he's not leaving until we get our money back they reluctantly gave us a refund.

.NEVER, EVER  ordering again. Buyer beware.

I work in customer service worst experience ever. I refuse to eat or do business anywhere where my money is only appreciated as long as it stays in their pockets.

Bottom line complete garbage."}
{"text":"Though I forget to check in and review it almost all of the time, I believe this little restaurant has some good eats. But you have to be able to look pass the language barrier, because it's so thick some of the staff just seem to come off as plain old rude.  And if you do get the ones who can speak and understand English, the service is quite excellent. My water was always kept full, they periodically checked up on me to see how the meal was, and they gave pretty good recommendations on the type of food to try. Forgive me for my writing in proper format, I am stuffing my face as I writing this :). Oh also, they have a groupon.... What's not good about that puahaha!!"}
{"text":"Went here for pho today, Groupon guided me there. I also thought it was the other restaurant. And I also thought it was weird that Papaya Thai is half the building and you can order off either menu. But how is that different from those Taco Bell/Pizza Hut places? We came for pho. We got chicken pho, spring rolls. It was fine, It was not as good as Da Vang (I miss you!) but the pho was great, the chicken was plentiful and juicy ( sliced breast meat) and they gave use everything but cilantro (I survived). Spring rolls were good. I would come again for pho. Its not clean and fancy, but other than overpriced Noodles Ranch, we know how these joints are...and personally I preferred this pho over Noodles Ranch! Service was also on par with every other Vietnamese restaurant I have been to, and you know what I mean...."}
{"text":"This was a favorite spot for me and my mom but due too very rude and bad service we will not return...we thought it was strange that they never had customers when we came but the food was always good so we didn't care. But to day the woman staff were.so rude to me and my mom we walked out and went to our other favorite pho spot all the way in mesa and it was worth it ...shame on you guys"}
{"text":"Fantastic Tom Yum soup. Service is wonderful and I've been there at both peak times, slow."}
{"text":"The food was ok, maybe 3 stars, but then I went to to the rest room...Good Lord help me! It was beyond filthy. It was disgusting! The dirt was long term filth...layer upon layer of dust & grime that have never been cleaned. The walls, the baseboards, toilet & sink...every square inch dirty. All I could think was if the public rest room looks like this, what the hell does the kitchen look like? My second thought was wishing I would have used the rest room before I ate, so I could have run away from this joint! Insult to injury moment? The \"A\" rating sign from the Department of Health in the front window! If you like \"Pig Pen\" ambiance, this is your kind of place. If not, find another restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best Pho Tempe has to offer and delivery is fast. Only complaint I have is the pricing can be a little higher than others, but it's definitely worth it. Use the Groupon and save some money! The best part is that is connected to a Thai restaurant so you have the possibility to eat both when you dine in!"}
{"text":"Egg rolls were rotten had to spit it out. Then found this in my pho soup not sure what it is but it's hard and looks like roach shell. So gross!!"}
{"text":"This place can't go out of business soon enough.   Maybe in Mesa, where the restaurant biz is less competitive, they could get away with being so subsubstandard, but in Tempe?  C'mon...  This place needs buckets of bleach.  I should have turned around at the door and walked out after the first whiff, but sometimes, ratholes will surprise you.  Sadly this delivered exactly what it promised.

I ordered a lemongrass chicken dish, thinking that would be safe, but got chunks of something in greasy globby gravy.  The spring rolls were dry and flavorless, there was supposed to be pork in there somewhere, but I never saw any.  My dining companions were unhappy with their meals as well.  Our waitress had all the disposition of Morticia Addams, except without her sunny, outgoing personality or quirky fashion sense.  The blaring TV was the perfect accompaniment to the meal from Hell.  Of course, we all got sick afterwards."}
{"text":"I was intrigued when I saw that Saigon Pho opened up, sharing half the space of the Papaya Thai building. We decided to try out their Vietnamese eats since we were in the area and hungry for dinner.

We came here on a Monday early evening, and we were the only customers in the restaurant. One other couple trickled in during our service though. The interior is cute, with a refreshing green palette that mimics the vibrant colors of Vietnamese food itself. 

We pored through the menu, and I honed in on the vegetarian items. I'm not a vegetarian, but I do try to limit my meat intake and are always on the lookout for good vegetarian dishes. They have a decent selection, and I decided on the vegetarian fish with vegetables and ginger. 

First though, we started out with the egg roll appetizer. It was crisp, flavorful, and delicious. It had the right mix of spices, and the dipping sauce went well with it. 

The entrees came shortly after. The faux fish was very good. It even had a dark bean curd \"skin\" that tasted a lot like the crisp skin of a nicely cooked fish. The texture was very similar to a white-fleshed fish, and was tender.

The sauce was similar to a sweet and sour sauce, laced with the kind of pea and carrot mixture you would find in the freezer section of a grocery store, ginger, cilantro, celery, tomato, and tofu. While I enjoyed the fish, after eating half of it, I got tired of the sweet/sour taste of the sauce and had the rest of it boxed up to go. The presentation was very nice though, and it came with a pickled daikon/carrot mixture, an orange slice, nicely sliced cucumber, and tomato slices.

My husband ordered the pho ga (Chicken pho), which had large pieces of chicken breast in it, with fresh vegetables and a lot of noodles to go with the broth and meat. I tasted some of the broth- it was decent, albeit a little watery tasting.

Overall, a decent place for Vietnamese cuisine, and probably the closest Vietnamese place to where we live!"}
{"text":"Pho Tempe holds the crown as the absolute worst dining experience of my life. Aside from having bland beef pho and a forgettable attempt at banh mi, Pho Tempe was filthy and doomed by poor service.

I called to ask when the restaurant would close on a Monday night, and the man on the phone was impossible to understand. He said something about 9 p.m. He also said something about 10. 

Is it open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.? Lobby open till 9 and carryout till 10?

To be safe, I hopped on GrubHub and submitted my order while driving to the restaurant. 

When I arrived, I explained I would like to use a Groupon to pay for my order. The woman working at the restaurant, in broken English, told me I couldn't use my Groupon for a carryout order. 

That's fine, I told her, we could just save the Groupon for another time. 

She told me to just eat the meal there, and all would be OK.

So I sat down and was brought a menu. She asked me to order. I told her I just wanted what I already had ordered on GrubHub. She said to forget about the GrubHub order and just order again. 

I asked if the online order would be cancelled. She said yes. So I ordered. And halfway through my meal, out came a second meal in to-go containers.

So there I was, full of food and staring at the same meal packed for later. The woman already had redeemed my Groupon, and she expected payment for the second meal. 

Put in a terrible situation by her inability to communicate or find a compromise, I simply tipped well and walked out on the to-go order.

The entire experience was so upsetting, I won't return to Pho Tempe."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Phoenix, my girlfriend and I were staying at the Aloft hotel and I was craving some Pho. Decided to get delivery ordered from here using GrubHub. 

Ordered the fresh spring rolls as an app. The peanut sauce was delicious with the roll. This was the highlight of the meal. You may ask yourself, \"how was this the highlight?\". Well, I ordered pho and the broth just wasn't right. Something was definitely missing. Also, the broth was on the sweet side, a little too sweet. Maybe not enough star anise. Maybe not enough cloves? Didn't grill the onions first? I don't know. But it just didn't taste authentic; tasted like they altered the flavor for more of an American palette. 

My girlfriend ordered the BBQ pork rice plate. Again, the marinade for the pork was overly sweet and didn't taste how it should. I've been to some other places in NYC and LA and they had some authentic tasting dishes. Maybe it was an off night for the cook. Or maybe I can just order a ton of those spring rolls....."}
{"text":"Great food yummy banana ice cream! Love it here! The lady who works here is really nice too"}
{"text":"The food here was great, but the furniture was old and ripped up, the service was very slow ( it took 15 minutes for my Thai Tea to come out ), and the condiments on the table were filthy and covered in dried up sauces. Given the messiness right in front on you I am very concerned about cleanliness in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We ordered through postmates and our food arrived on time and everything correct! I had the fried tofu (omfg so good and crispy) and the vegetarian pho. My bf had the dumplings that he thought were bomb and the rare steak and tofu pho. My only complaint is that the broths (veggie and meat stock) weren't labeled. They were different broths as they were slightly different color and my bf had to taste them and was able to tell the difference. it would have been helpful if they were labeled. Overall great experience and will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"So we went there this evening with a Groupon and decided the food was very good. In fact, it appeared that they included some egg rolls that we did not order. When we questioned the extra $5.95 on our bill, the owner became upset with us. Very obvious they were hoping we wouldn't notice the extra charge. Will Never go back. I don't like blatant dishonesty."}
{"text":"I've never written a bad review, I've never sent back food, I rarely ever have negative enough opinions to warrant a rant but this place was SO BAD it makes me angry !! Everything was gross. Service isn't even something that I care too much about but even that was exceptionally BAD. Don't go there. Its gross. The glasses weren't clean,  the place is shady AF, food is overpriced for what it is, I could only muster a few sips of broth but the everything else we ordered was borderline inedible, etc etc. You've been warned !!"}
{"text":"I ordered Pho Tempe off of grub hub. I was very excited to see that a pho place that had a delivery option. I ordered the seafood Pho with Thai tea boba. 

For one, they took an hour and a half to deliver my meal to my house when they are located right down the street. The way that the pho was presented was very weird. One take out box had all the fix ins (including the rice noodles) and there was a bowl of broth. Typically seafood pho has shrimp, fish cake, calamari, and oysters or clams. I literally couldn't figure out what was in this dish, other than the shrimp. (The description on the website didn't match what I ordered). Take out bowl, as well, was too small. When I put all the ingredients that I wanted into the bowl, the broth kept spilling over.

 The thai tea boba didn't have boba in it and was very strong instead of sweet. 

I do not recommend ordering from this establishment."}
{"text":"The owners of this place used to have the some of the best Thai food around.  For some reason the quality of the Thai place they also own next door has gone down hill.  I was hoping that when they branched out to Vietnamese that it might be better.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  The pho broth was really bland.  My fiances vermicelli was a bit better than my Pho."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic food! Everything I've had I've always loved. The pad thai is my go-to, and their boba tea is delicious. Fast service, friendly employees, authentic food. It's a great place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is unclean, has poor service, and pricey vs other like-type restaurants. 

I ordered the half chicken and rice (#32). It came with 2 drumsticks. WTF?

This place is tanking and it's easy to see why after eating here - numerous other reviews say the same thing.  I'd look for t
Other places to eat."}
{"text":"Me and my coworker ordered here. We work overnight shift and usually order food at night from different places.

I ordered Bo Luc Lac - Shaking Beef, this was pretty good however they forgot the rice with it. This made it a little less filling then it should have been. I also ordered the Green Tea Smoothie.  The smoothie was good and I have no complaints.

My co-worker ordered Pho Ga - Chicken Phi which he really liked.  The only thing he would change is the amount of spice provided.  We can order extra next time. 

The order took about an hour and a half, the estamated time was 45-60 minutes.  My co-worder put pheonix and not tempe.  I do admit that partial responsibility is on us.  However we provided our contact number for a reason and I dont believe I should have had to call to get an update before the driver called me.

I would eat here again because what I got was good and fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Food is really average....we ordered sausage shrimp rice fry and yes my dish comes with 2 shrimp.....if u have living social deal then worth a try otherwise go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Smoothies are the bomb! Boba is perfectly cooked & the jelly is sweet! Chicken Pho-excellent broth, fresh veggies, perfectly prepared as specially ordered, but the chicken was a little funky & it took over an hour."}
{"text":"Very authentic food delivered by friendly staff. This is the real deal. They own the place next door, but I haven't tried it yet. Not sure why people get so confused that they have the same owner.

Anyway, I strongly recommend the beef Pho and the mango+ginger smoothie. Phenomenal."}
{"text":"I got delivery from here last night and after the delivery man left I realized the soda I ordered was missing. I didn't really think much of it because I was starving and the food just looked so good. I got the vegetarian pho which is to die for. Anywho, I finished eating with my boyfriend when we hear a knock at the door which was the delivery man who went out of his way to drive back to my house to drop off the soda that we didn't get! He even threw in an extra can of soda!! For something so small like a soda, I was really blown away for that man to drive back to make sure I got what I ordered! So awesome!!

Overall, great food, super well priced, good portions, and great service!"}
{"text":"Walked in looked at the water in the Turtle tank (disgusting ).noticed no Health Dept Signage ..looked up reviews ..decided not to eat here..what a shame to was in the mood for some Pho' and Spring rolls ..oh well  always willing to try new place's ..just couldn't do it..there was a funky sent in the air..
Note to Owners: place to dark not inviting. .staff don't seem friendly at all.."}
{"text":"This place is dingy and run down. The service was barely passable. I did not enjoy either the Pho or the Pork plate. The spring rolls were pretty good and made ever better by the peanut sauce they came with. By far the best thing we were served were the crab puffs - and I don't eat fish. Those I would go back for. To be fair my dining companion enjoyed all of food but agreed on service and decor."}
{"text":"WARING DINERS
Our order took 2 hours to arrive. Sub par food. Shrimp chewy.  Pork spring rolls had one tiny sliver of pork in it. Very inadequate. Green tea was not green tea. Called after 1 1/2 hours and person answering could not speak English. Very frustrating.  Driver called to ask for building number then husband was abruptly hung up on and he still didn't arrive for another 30 minutes. 
Overall so disappointing in service and food.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME  OR MONEY ON THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Ordered rare steak and meatball pho. They charged me $9 and give me two slices of rare steak and 1 meatball cut into 3 pieces. Such a rip off."}
{"text":"I order the special rice plate that have grill pork chop with egg and other stuffs with white rice and fish sauce. The pork chop was over cook or over microwave that I can't even chew and no flavor,  and the fried Egg was over cook too."}
{"text":"Well, I must admit that I was a little hesitant to try Saigon Pho after reading some of the reviews here on Yelp ... but I had already purchased a Groupon certificate sight-unseen and decided that it would probably be at least worth a discounted meal out for the family after a long, busy week (read: no cooking for the parents!!). To say we were pleasantly surprised is an understatement!! 

We took our family of 6 (all non-militant vegans!) to the McClintock & Broadway location for a late dinner on a Saturday night. Saigon Pho is not the closest Vietnamese to us -- there are at least 5 closer (including the Alma School & Knox location) and Pho Van (Dobson & Warner), which has been our go-to choice for until now. Pho Van is closer and more convenient ... but after this experience, if time is not an issue, we'll definitely be making the drive to the Tempe Saigon Pho! 

As vegans who are comfortable flexing a bit when we dine out, it was nice to find a variety of vegetarian options ... AND a nice complement of vegan fare as well. Pricing was spot-on and portion size was excellent. Customer service was excellent - fast, friendly, and totally free of any of the bad experiences noted in other Yelp reviews. The atmosphere is definitely casual -- a bit dated and kitschy, but clean and comfortable. 

We ordered the vegetarian pho (and yes, it was authentically vegetarian broth - not chicken broth with only vegetables) ... hands down the best pho broth we've had in the Phoenix area yet! Incredibly tasty. I typically like to add a substantive amount of sriracha and hoisin to my pho ... but only added a minimal amount this time. Heavy on the vegetables and tofu -- perfect for us. My 10yo daughter devoured hers, and Mom and I shared one as well. We also ordered the vegetarian tofu fried rice (my least favorite honestly, but my 12yo loved it). The vegetarian rice noodles with vegetables and tofu was another big hit -- nice depth of flavor throughout, not just noodles plus sauce. Finally, we went out on a limb and ordered the \"Tofu Fish\" ... wasn't sure what to expect, but again was pleasantly surprised. First, a HUGE portion of small-cubed tofu in a sweet/gingery tomato sauce, served over three decent-sized pieces of faux fish. Continues to amaze me what can be done with tofu! We all tried the fish, and my 14yo liked it enough that she conned me into trading with her! So we all ate kind of \"family style\" and simply enjoyed this experience all around. 

We have another Groupon, so we'll definitely be back ... but I'm confident we'll be returning time and time again based on tonight's experience!! So pleased!!"}
{"text":"Long time yelp reader, never time poster. I just decided to sign up and write my first review because my experience was THAT bad at Saigon Pho that I felt it was only ethical to pay it forward to others.

**CERTAINLY NOT WORTH THE GROUPON****

**Disclaimer** Neither I nor my girlfriend are difficult to please and we admittedly don't have very high expectations for restaurants. We found the Groupon on for this place randomly after the Groupon we had planned on using for another sushi place had closed, so we gave this place a shot without reading much of the reviews.

First, food:   The food was mediocre, at best. The vegetarian spring rolls were LITERALLY just a piece of iceberg lettuce wrapped in a sheath of rice. No veggies or anything else. Avoid. The sauce was watered down and not tasty. My girlfriend and I both ordered Pho which came promptly enough. The pho itself was neither terrible nor great, pretty standard I guess I would say. Good enough to fill me at the same but nothing that tasty.

Service:  One word, ATROCIOUS. On so many different levels. First, I am not a high maintenance person what so ever. My girlfriend and I are nice people. But, here is a breakdown of our experience going to Saigon Pho

1) We are seated and given 4 different menus (the thai and vietnamese place next to it are linked----confusing, with different pricing. I asked if I could ask ask a question and the young teen working there did not speak any english and could not answer basic questions on the menu. 

2) They did not bring us silverware, or offer us water. Our drinks had strange additions to our thai ice tea in it---when we asked what it was, the server said \"I'm actually not sure\"....?????

3) We had a very, very uncomfortable situation with the Dishwasher coming out and trying to be social with us in the middle of our meal. I have no idea if this guy was high or not (he looked pretty stoned) but he perpetually interrupted our conversation by asking inane questions about if we had any weekend plans.....and uttering rude remarks.

4) Lastly, the straw that broke the camels back, when I went to go pay with a groupon, the dishwasher came for it (where is my server?????) and said \"You know it would have been better if you told us it was a Groupon when you were ordering\". At that point I was on the verge of cussing the guy out and telling him I wanted to speak to a manager.....so rude.

Literally, the shitty ambiance, poor manors, and sub-par food of this place ruined our date night (which I previously thought was impossible---again, we didn't have high expectations for this place).

Overall this place had shitty staff, low-to-decent quality food and prices, and a pretty ugly restaurant to hang out inside. Highly recommend to avoid."}
{"text":"The restaurant was divided into two places from the former Papaya Thai Restaurant but the same people are running both places.  It is the mother who is Vietnamese who married a Thai husband with two generations running both places after Jasmine of Mesa closed.  Here is my take..Great appetizers (Vietnamese Style pressed ham Spring roll) along with the great Mango Salad (I still preferred the Thai Version of Papaya salad but decided to give mango a try).  The big weakness is their Pho..It is very water down and the broth is just way too light without proper pasteurization (16 hour Min with ox-tail) so I didn't eat it.  I told her that we were full but in truth it didn't pass my pallet so I will probably stick with their Thai dishes instead.  That said, she is great and very gracious and love to see me as a customer.  I have asked to have my beansprouts boiled with my soup but he brought it first (lack of knowledge on how to serve on his part because he wasn't properly trained--typical white guy so I don't fault him on it)."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Saigon Pho and was very impressed! My rare beef pho was hot and absolutely delicious, the service was friendly, and delivery was fast. Great value for the food as well. I will definitely be trying this restaurant dine-in for the full experience!"}
{"text":"We went there just now, and it smelled so bad we left! The seat were filly of hair and the tables felt sticky. Disgusting restroom. Don't come here!"}
{"text":"This place is weird. Actually we couldn't find it at first because it said Pho Tempe outside. And it seems that they have totally different menu from \"Authentic\" Saigon Pho, I wonder is that ok to use the same name?

Anyway, I have to say, the pho I ordered was decent flavor and the service was just fine. BUT, the potion really wasn't too much, either pho or broken rice. That's really disappointing. I think I'll not come back here without a Groupon"}
{"text":"The other reviewers are spot on for this restaurant.

1) Combined restaurants. This is combined with Tempe Pho. Had a Living Social Deal so thought I'd give it a try. The Asian lady (seemed like possibly a part owner) said I could get it to go but would have to pay the gratuity of 18% which seemed fair. But, she also said I would have to spend a high minimum amount before I could use the deal. That part was unexpected.

2) Environment unclean. The tables were sticky and had greasy residue as if they weren't using clean washing water/soap to clean each table, but were possibly using old water without any soap. 

2a)  Condiment bottles were filthy on the outside as if they never cleaned or wiped them down as a regular part of the process each day. I was worried about picking up germs and bacteria by just using the condiments at the table.  The soy sauce tasted like a really off brand that I was not accustomed to. Soy sauce is of course fermented soy bean, but it did not taste like any soy sauce I've had before.

2b) Forks were in a bottle/vase at each table. This doesn't seem proper by health code standards, as anyone could contaminate the utensils when they are left out like that and not individually wrapped.  I opted for chopsticks that were individually wrapped instead.

3) Beverage. My iced tea was refreshing, until I reached about halfway through it and saw a flying bug floating in it that was just short of a centimeter long. I asked for a new glass, not sure if they brought me back the same glass but refilled.

4) Food. The Pho noodles I got was seafood special with meat and seafood. I barely found tiny pieces of some random seafood in it that was not shrimp, not scallop, not fake crab meat, not sure what it was, but there was very little of it.  The broth was not the best I've had.  While eating the noodles, the broth turned very cloudy, which led me to think the noodles were likely not washed off, so the substance on the noodles came off into the broth.  

5)  Fried wonton shrimp appetizer: The shrimp was mostly raw. I could tell by the translucency of the shrimp as well as the color and texture. I ate them, hoping I would not get food poisoning.  Fortunately, I did not.  I would have thought that the little shrimp would easily get cooked in a fryer with a thin layer of wonton around it.  So unexpected.

6)  Grilled beef entree:  This was great. Grilled perfectly, not raw, tasted good with the seasoning, and it did not seem un-fresh.  This was the only thing I had no complaint about.

7) Seating: Vinyl booths were not filthy as I recall. They stuck me in the front near the sound/TV controls and devices. Many cords were strewn about there.  I had trouble getting into the booth as it was partially blocked by these items.  

8) Someone mentioned that they changed the names of the restaurant because of the poor reviews. Not sure how that helps since any new customers will write new reviews and unless they change something about the things people do not like, the reviews will likely be similar.

9) the Asian lady (again, who seemed to be part owner), was very bossy and barked orders to the guy waiter in dreadlocks. This guy was very nice and provided good service.  She would often bark out things across the quiet, dark dining area to him.  It was strange, her interaction with him.  He did not seem to like working there, but yet still provided very good service to all of the tables.

All in all, I would not return here. I can see why they have deals with Groupon and Living Social.  I am guessing not many people return though after trying it out.

For great Pho, go to Tea Lite Cafe on May Blvd near Scottsdale Road, that is a consistently great experience, with fresh ingredients, quick service, and fair pricing.

The name of the restaurant on my Living Social deal was \"PHO TEMPE\".  But, this is the address and restaurant that comes up. I guess this coincides with other reviewers mentioning that they have changed the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery here a few times. Delivery is fast and always on time. The Pho is always super hot by the time is gets to my door. They include all the side fixings for pho and the broth is always hot enough to cook the raw meat. Pho broth flavor is okay and doesn't need much added to it, I wish the portions were bigger but can't complain for the price and convenience."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! The food was okay, ambiance was pretty terrible, but the service was appalling. It took 10 minutes to get our drinks after a lot of upselling even though an iced tea is all i wanted. when I asked for an additional fork to feed my toddler with, the old woman who ran the place slammed a whole carafe of assorted silverware On our table since grabbing a single fork was too tedious. What really threw me over the edge is when we got our bill we were charged an extra $5. I inquired about the charge and she said it was for egg rolls. Yes, we received 3 chincey egg rolls with our dinner, but they looked like something included with the meal, not an appetizer option. I said we never ordered any. The waitress sat down in my both, and yelled at me for eating them if I never ordered them! It was literally an unbelievable experience and I honestly felt that she was trying to scam us and grew very angry when it didn't work. Eat at your own risk and double check your final bill!!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible..service was a disaster, food was ok but unless you feel like waiting and hour for food and having people in the back argue with you over the food then I would highly recommend never coming here, there are much much better Pho places."}
{"text":"Went on the groupon thinking this was the Siagon Pho on alma school. Well I am not sorry I made this mistake! The pho was very good, I ordered the seafood pho, it had lots of seafood really good tasting broth.  We also ordered the cured pork spring roll that was very good too! 
Very very nice lunch I will return."}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon thinking it was for the place on alma school, later found out it wasn't for that place but what the hell I paid for it and was in the area.  My husband and I tried it out. His 1st comment / question was \"why isn't any one here?\"
I noticed crumbs at the booth we were seated in. We place our order 3 items and a drink.  2 of the 3 items were not what we order. They fixed it but charged us for the correction.  I had chicken pho the broth has a strong cinnamon taste to it. I have had chicken pho at many other place from Cali to Az and never have I had a cinnamon taste to it.  It was unbearable and couldn't eat it. 

For us being the only patrons in their and get our order wrong can only make me wonder what kind of service you get when there tables are full. 

I will not be returning and feel they should have to change their name. I wouldn't want the Saigon pho place on alma school  and knoxs to get a bad rap because of this place."}
{"text":"Never received our order through Amazon restaurant service. We were hoping for a nice evening with delivery. I actually would have never ordered if I looked at the reviews first. I'm not sure if it was a problem with Amazon delivery or if it was the restaurant but we never received the food to be able to try it."}
