{"text":"Popped in for a light meal of miso soup & a few veggie rolls. Miso was ok (if salty), but the cucumber roll was dried out. Yam tempura roll was slimy & greasy; I threw up after the second piece. 

I don't recommend Natural Sushi."}
{"text":"Probably the most disgusting sushi I ever had in my life. the sushi was way too big and EVERYTHING had too much rice the sushi, the hand rolls and let's just say you shouldn't choose a place where they have French fries, onion rings and sushi in the same menu. The washroom looked like something from a movie where it's been abandoned  for decades and hasn't been cleaned. 

The food was just gross the salmon at the entrance looked fresh but when served it was warm when raw fish should be refrigerated and with lemon to burn all bacteria. After that sushi place my friends and I did not eat for the rest of the day and skipped breakfast for the next day because we felt disgusting. Service was horrible there was a little girl running around and just annoying."}
{"text":"I like to go there for lunch, very good lunch food and price you can't get anywhere cheap than here. For sure, I will go back."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but I was so angry at how terrible the delivery service was I didn't enjoy it at all. The delivery girl could find my unit, kept calling wanting me to go out and get my food...defeating the purpose of delivery I think...eventually made it to my door...pushed the food at me, grumbling how it was NOT their delivery area...10 minutes away is not your delivery area? Better change your Just-eat.ca settings then folks...tell them you only deliver across the street!"}
{"text":"We came in simply because we were in a hurry and didn't check the reviews before. 
The place smelled fine to me, and I have been accused of having a hound dog sense of smell.
The place looks pretty shabby from the outside so I didn't know what to expect but there were plenty of people inside and it was quite big.
we order the sushi lunch without looking at the menu... It was 6.99$ and came with soup, salad, 4 nigiri (2 white fish, 1 imitation crab and 1 salmon - the thickest piece I ever got, was like 2 pieces of sashimi), 4 avocado rolls, and 6 shrimp tempura rolls with avocado, which were extremely fresh, delish, and cooked when we ordered - some places have the tempura ready and lying around and you get it totally cold at lunch time.
The service was really quick too.
I was happy, will go back again for lunch."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this restaurant 2.5 stars... But I'll be nice and round up instead of down.

I came in here for the first time a couple months back with a couple friends. At the time I was trying to stick to a vegan lifestyle, so I only ordered off of the vegetarian section. I was in love with their avocado rolls; thick, refreshing cuts of rich avocado wrapped in the perfect amount of rice. I also had the enoki rolls which were so freaking awesome! I can't express how much I love mushrooms. I was impressed by the decor seeing as the exterior of the store is rather questionable. My friends had the AYCE lunch, their only complaint was there was too much batter on the tempura and my friend had over ordered as usual...

After the first visit I recommended the place to my boyfriend and we came here quite often after I finished work. He loves the teriyaki beef rolls. We tried asking what type of beer was for the beer special and i couldnt get a straight forward answer from her. In the end we were confused and chose to order a bottle instead of tap. Our pet peeve was having the waitresses pour his drink for him. To be honest, I understand they want to have good service, but it's rather annoying that you insist on pouring a brew into a glass when you don't even know how. The entire scenario happened in slow motion. She brought the beer over and put it down with the glass next to it. Was going to walk away but decided to pour it for my boyfriend. So she did it. The head that I saw in at the top of the glass made my eyes pop. Also, to top it off, the glass wasn't cold.. And because she poured it so skillfully, she took away almost a third of the brew that was left in the bottle thinking she poured it all due to the gigantic head that filled to the top of the glass. As she walked away my boyfriend and I looked at each other thinking \"did that seriously just happen? Did you see how much was left in bottle?!\".  BIG NO!.......NO!!!

I find that the younger sushi chef that is usually placed in the bar at the front is shy but a much, MUCH better sushi maker than the older male chef. I'm not sure if they got rid of the younger one, but I haven't seen him the last couple times I went in. If they did get rid of him, bring him back with the rest of my beer!

Couple of weeks ago I came back with my boyfriend and a couple other people. This time I had the AYCE lunch and had such a hard time asking the lady if we can order for a 4th person for them to show up later, but still have them pay for the lunch cost. I couldn't understand her and she wouldn't directly answer me but felt like she was beating around the bush. She asked the other worker in mandarin and the older man in the front said something in English that didn't make any sense either. The fish was okay, the teriyaki steak was really good, the tempura was piping hot, the avocado was sad, the rolls were falling apart and the california rolls were sad too. It was just over all okay. I don't know what's going on, but it's making me not want to eat here anymore. Also, the decor is starting to come off gross to me. At first it was nice, but after a few visits it's blah since I can notice the few things here and there. 

Anyway, to summarize all this. I was very impressed at the beginning (5 stars), was still impressed half way through (4.5stars) and now I'm disappointed with the language barrier (they explain things to me that i cant comprehend), the food and the last couple services. I just got pick-up and the lady kept handing me a menu when I repeated pick up about 3 times. I just hope they get their stuff together again, 'cause I find it ridonkulous coincidence if I just happen to come in on the days they have bad avocados :(

Oh, if your customer tells you visa, do you really find it necessary to ask \"you don't have cash?\"- it's not the same as asking \"do you happen to have a penny?\"."}
{"text":"I am here @ the moment and can only tell you that the service in this place is terrible!!!
The waitress acts similar to food police"}
{"text":"Very nice little place for sushi?after shopping?I love the salmon delight and the deepfried ice cream tasted amazing"}
{"text":"Decent all-you-can-eat lunch options and a place that doesn't choke your maki rolls in rice. When it comes to AYCE sushi, first I tell people not to expect the greatest quality. Then, I advise them to choose a strategy to eat a well balanced (eh?) and a satisfying meal. 

For example, I start with few sips of soup and bites of salad to make my system ready. Order some hot green tea instead of cold water which doesn't go well with hot food. Start with sushi - the simple slice of fish on a bed of rice. Discard half the rice and stow it away on your plate. Next, order some maki rolls (or hand rolls) and devour them. To give your taste glads a break, get some cooked food, such as tereyaki chicken, which you will eat with the rice saved previously. All the fried foods - dumplings, spring rolls, tempura - are strictly to be eaten at the end of your meal. That's how you do it. You are welcome."}
{"text":"My wife and I saw this place yesterday while walking along Yonge St. and were drawn in with how decently priced it was.  As soon as we walked in, we both noticed a kinda \"fishy\" smell.  They had a fish tank in the back; I gave them the benefit of the doubt that it was just that (remember this, it will be important in a minute).  

We ordered, the waitress was nice enough, and the food came pretty quickly.  

The problem was the food itself.  The sushi tasted off.  It had a fishy taste and smell to it (sounds weird, it being raw fish and all, but sushi lovers will know that this shouldn't ever be the case, and in fact can mean that the fish has gone bad).  We called the waitress over politely mentioned the fish tasted off, and that we couldn't eat it.  Like I said earlier, the waitress was nice enough when we got in, so we were expecting her to understand and do something to rectify the situation; be it offering us something else from the menu, comping our meal, or even just an apology would have been nice. Instead, she argued with us that it was fine and that she hadn't gotten complaints, so we were wrong.  We told her again that we weren't eating it, and told her that we'd gladly pay for the mango roll we got (our son ate about half of it), but that we weren't paying for the rest, as it was pretty much inedible.  She literally said nothing, and just kinda wandered off to deal with the one or two other people in the restaurant.  

After sitting there for about 10 minutes, expecting some sort of bill, we got fed up with being ignored (she would literally look the other way when she had to walk past us).  We checked the price of the mango sushi from the menu, put money on the table for it, and left.

As soon as we stood up, we became worth her time again, as the waitress IMMEDIATELY ran over to our table, checked to see how much we left, and then chased us out of the store, mad that we hadn't paid full price for the food that we had refused to eat.  She demanded I go back in with her, so I did.  I took the opportunity to let the people in there know that they'd do well to be cautious if they planned on eating the sushi there (I wouldn't have said anything, but a family with 2 younger children had just come in, and I didn't want anyone getting sick).  The chefs in front called me 'senile' (I'm 25...), and i turned around and left again.  

This ALL could have been avoided if the waitress had just acknowledged that we weren't happy with the food, and offered to do ANYTHING at all to rectify the situation.  Instead we were ignored and chased down for the $15 we refused to pay for the food we refused to eat.  I hope they feel this all was worth it, as I will never return, and will advise you all now to steer clear."}
{"text":"The food quality can be improved, I don't like the crispy tempura bits in my roll. May be try to reduce the quantity of the bits. But the service is good. I like their chicken teriyaki, but sometimes the source is too less and the meat tastes not as flavourful as it should be."}
{"text":"I've read the reviews of this restaurant and I feel like it needs an update. I started coming to Natural Sushi about a year and a half ago. Yes, the décor and bathrooms left much to be desired. However they have completely RE-DECORATED the bathrooms and the dining room in the past couple months. The one main waitress can be bitchy at times, especially when the restaurant is busy! The other waitress doesn't speak very good English - so this can be frustrating at times. Admittedly, the service is poorer than other restaurants IMHO. 
However, my meal was great and so I kept coming back - both for eat in AYCE, and for take out. The food is very good though!  I love the Goyza, the Tempura is always done perfectly - veggies or shrimp!  The rolls that I LOVE and can recommend are *ANY* of the Dragon rolls (green, black, gold) The Toronto roll, spider roll, Queen roll - OH and of course the spicy salmon and tuna rolls are awesome!  I also enjoy the avocado salad. It has *very* generous pieces of avocado, and they will put Tobiko on top - as much or as little as you want. I usually order $1 of Tobiko and it's just enough and tastes amazing!
I go here at least once every couple of weeks. It is a nice little restaurant with decent sushi (as good as any other AYCE restaurants.  And often I get take out as they offer a 10% discount on take out orders.
I honestly would recommend Natural Sushi to my friends and family and of course, I'm going back.... again and again!"}
{"text":"Good miso and salad dressing. Hearty portions. Your standard sushi fare at a great price. And the cheapest beer south of Bloor."}
{"text":"This place was HORRIBLE!  We stopped in because we noticed the menu and the prices seemed reasonable.  The place stunk of fish (that should have been the first clue).  The Salmon roll as well as the California roll (which contains CRAB for someone not overly familiar with sushi, and the crab is sweet flavoured and NOT raw) both tasted fishy.  I literally spit them out.  Sometimes I personally just don't jive with salmon so when I ate it and had to spit it out I just chalked it up to my personal tastes, but then the California roll, I literally nearly threw up.
Needless to say I offered to pay for what I had eaten and then left.  The waitress caused a scene but I don't really care, I'm thankful nobody in my family (including my son) did NOT get sick from this place.  As we walked out she chased us out onto the street and demanded we come back.  My husband did, and promptly told everyone NOT to order the sushi as it didn't smell or taste right.  He even commented that the philladelphia roll (smoked salmon and cream cheese) tasted off.  

I/we  Will NEVER return and will probably laugh any time I walk past.
It was dinner time (6pm) on a Saturday and there were only 4 other customers in the restaurant, it was dark and dingy and as I mentioned, it stunk.  Not that I go to a sushi place for the decor, so it really was the fishy smell that is my biggest issue.  The waitress was nice enough, until I complained about the food, nobody else had complained so mine was irrelavent, she then ignored us, right up until we didn't pay for the whole meal.

Needless to say if negative stars were an option, that's what I would rate this place.  I only give it one because I have no choice of zero DO NOT GO THERE EVER!"}
{"text":"stay away!!!!!!!!!!! 
the worst sushi and japanese cooked food in the world!!

this restaurant should be out of business!!!

the sushi chef is very rude and has a bad ass attitude.
the waitress named dong has a bad ass attitude as well!

the food is completely very poor quality.

me and my wife had the all you can eat buffet.

the sashimi was not fresh and i could not eat it all.

i wanted to throw up all over the table as i felt so sick.

if you are wise you will never ever step foot in this restaurant.

i will be phoning the toronto health inspector on monday morning. as they are closed on weekends.

this is not acceptable.

as well i feel very strongly that the waitress, dong and the chef do not like white people.

they were friendly to the japanese man that walked into the restuarant while i was there.

this proves that they hate white, canadian people.

they should just go back to their country of origin if they hate white canadian people so much.

this waitress was  colder than ice.

i will do all i can do to put this restaurant out of business permanently.

i have met many japanese and other asian people over the years and they have been polite and kind for the most part.

first of all the chef and waitress looked more chinese than japanese.

the fact remains that they are ignorant for judging me and being rude to me because i am a white born and raised canadian.

i love all cultures and races of different kinds of people but i do not have any respect and tolerance for people from different backgrounds and cultures not born in canada that do not respect me and judge me with out even knowing me.

i am a very polite and respectful gentleman but i will not and never tolerate rude disrespectful people especially when i am spending my hard earned money on food that should be fresh and the server should be friendly and smile.

 i wonder what the owner thinks of how his staff behave
or 
maybe he too hates white canadian people!!

if you go and eat at this restaurant you have been forewarned ahead of time!"}
{"text":"This place is really inexpensive and has good sushi. I don't go here expecting to eat exceptional sushi or get exemplary service. I do go here (very often) because it is cheap, fast, and good, and they do not skimp on the fish!

The food is consistent, so you always know what you're getting. As a bonus, they have GREAT vegetable tempura. I'd also personally recommend the spicy tuna roll. If you're looking for something more substantial, go for the Gold Dragon Roll, it's the dynamite roll with salmon on top. So delicious!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for!

It's been 10 hours since I ate here.
And I'm not dead.

Easy to miss on Yonge street, it looks pretty run down from the outside.
Inside, the restaurant was bigger than I thought with basic decor.

There were lunchtime customers eating away.
The restaurant has an ACYE option that looked popular.

I decided to give one of the lunch specials a try for $5.99.
It's $5.99, so you can't help but wonder if you've bought yourself salmonella. 
With the special, I got six spicy tuna rolls, 6 yam tempura rolls, a miso soup and salad.

The rolls were large and stuffed mostly with crispy tempura bits.
It wasn't amazing, but I didn't expect it to be.

It's cheap. I can't comment on the freshness of the fish because I didn't really have anything raw.  But, I'd probably stick to bento boxes for a cheap lunch."}
{"text":"I try to avoid AYCE Sushi downtown, but when the craving hits, Natural Sushi is the go-to spot for dinner. There are 2 dinner AYCE menus $17.99 (small menu) and $20.99 (larger menu), but the BF and I always go for the smaller menu. As long as I can get my sashimi, I'm good.
Natural Sushi is a small spot along the restaurant filled Yonge street. There are a few booths and like some people say, they're a weird size that can barely fit 4 people. Service is always fast, could use a bit of smiles tho. 
The quality of sushi and sashimi is good for an AYCE. Their hot food comes out piping hot and there's a lot to choose from... tempura, teriyaki and teppanyaki... Oh My! The only complaint when the BF gets the pop, it's almost always flat.
Will definitely continue to come back when the next craving hits... even if I live near Bloor Street sushi row."}
{"text":"I agree with the two posts below about the waitress and the new younger chef. He's definitely a better sushi maker than the old chef. Anyways here's my honest review:

I've  been going to this place for THREE years, on a regular basis. Never went for two weeks without going here because of 1) CHEAP for decent quality food and 2) one of the few sushi restaurants that deliver past 10pm and I live very close by. On frequent occasions I'd go there for their bento combo's about twice a week even, and on weekends I'd always go for all you can eat specials and party platters with other people. I used to go there back before when they had an older-chef and they'd give us free spring rolls if we ordered more than 50.00$ worth of food, which I liked, because it's just nice gesture... Mind you I have very good relationships with all of my restaraunt-friends-and-acquaintences who love to have me dine in, most of the restaurants on Yonge st. I am very friendly with. This is the only place that I am pissed off about. For being their loyal customer for 3 years, the waitress with the raspy voice has NEVER EVER once smiled or been nice to me. Horrible slow service..!!! but I bared the unpleasantness for the cheap food, because how else can a student dine out and eat sushi 2-3 times a week? However, yesterday I had a big piece of plastic in my salad. The waitress as per usual was grouchy and when I told her, she said \"oh really?\" and just snatched it out of the table and gave me a new one. No apologies. No smile. Nothing. Not even asking \"is everything okay?\" in between. (They never did anyway). When I came to the counter, she didn't give me the usual 10% dine-in student discount for the regular menu they always give us. Still charged us the full bill. When I asked her to correct my bill she asked me and my bf (both) for a god damn student ID. We've been going there for 3 YEARS PEOPLE. Wtf? After she both checked our ID, I told her nicely \"If you said sorry I wouldn't have minded\" but she passively just stared right at me muttered \"okay sorry\". What the eff. It's not like I am stingy on my tips either and whenever I ask for anything I am always nice. Anyways, I am a bit upset for their crappy service ruining the at least decent experience of eating there... Will miss that place and the cheap sushi but I definitely will not miss that raspy voiced grouchy waitress. Don't go there!"}
{"text":"I think I had the largest Sushi All You Can it in Toronto. It seems to say to me, \"I do not want you to eat any more food after eating me.\" Why do they name all you can it? I could be able to eat only 4 pieces of sushi. The size is like baby's fist."}
{"text":"The sushi was good but the chicken was completely undercooked, it was pink inside. The service was horrendous, 4 of us came here for lunch and there was only one person who was making the sushi even though the restaurant was full. We came here for all you can eat but were treated like we were stealing their food, the woman who was there accused us of wasting food but when we ordered and finished everything that was brought out, she told us that we could not order more. Terrible experience, would never go here again because of poooooooor customer service. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Just a basic sushi place. I went for all you can eat lunch for $11.99 served from noon til 4pm. The food was alright, nothing to write home about, but for the price it was what I expected. The sushi is made fresh to order, and the AYCE menu had about 40 items. All in all, service was good, food was alright, and the price is right! One thing I would say is beware when ordering sushi rolls for the AYCE menu. They are larger than most sushi places, and like most AYCE sushi places you have to pay for what you don't eat."}
{"text":"I suggest coming here hungry. I had the maki set, and it was quite filling.

Great because:
- tea with kettle provided with meal
- service is great
- rice portion is significantly less than other places
- fish portions are big

Not so great:
- fish quality could be better, but it's not much different from other sushi places I've tried downtown in that price range
- within the price range, it's not the cheapest"}
{"text":"I had been avoiding this place due to negative reviews, but wanted to try it as the food looked good and it is close to my house.

WOW, was I pleasantly surprised! The fish was fresh and delicious and the service was great.

Only 2 minor complaints - overcooked shrimp tempura and +$1 for Friday and Saturday all you can eat lunch.

That said, I will be returning!"}
{"text":"My favourite go to sushi restaurant in downtown Toronto for value for the money.

First of all, I never order All You Can Eat sushi anywhere (even though this place offers it) as it inevitably results in terrible to mediocre outcomes. I go for the a la carte menus and cherry-pick the rolls and items I think will best suit the occasion - it costs more, but this is a column about food, not frugality.

I rate my sushi spots according to value for the money - if I am paying big bucks, they have to deliver accordingly. When we eat here, the walk out the door price (including tax and tip) is about $20 per head, not including alcohol. For that price, I want good food, but I don't expect fugu or lobster rolls. Natural Sushi delivers. The decor is 1970's diner, and the music matches the decor. Something's gotta give for a downtown restaurant to provide good food for that price, and it's the veneer tables and dollar store decorations here. Service is usually very good, but I've been there when they are short staffed and the wait can be extensive.

They have a good selection of the usual suspects (Dynamite, California, etc.) mixed in with some truly delicious creations. My favourites include the Natural Dragon roll (a fabulous blend of eel and spicy tuna), the Queen roll (scallop, shrimp and crab), the Bloor roll (tuna, avocado and green onion), the Rice Paper Wrap, a sort of de-constructed California Roll, and the Tuna Hand Roll (packed with tuna!). Portions are generous for the pricing, and the rolls aren't overstuffed with rice as so many other restaurants try to cut corners.

For the cost conscious patrons, they usually have an excellent beer special on the go, and the box meals are good value as well - tasty, well prepared and well priced. They offer an all you can eat lunch and dinner here, but I've never gone down that road as invariably too many of the items I want to order are not included in the AYCE menus.

Hands down, Natural Sushi beats all the other sushi restaurants of the same price point within the area, and I've been to all of them."}
{"text":"I'm mixed about this place.  When I walked in I noticed a distinct \"fishy\" smell as well, which set an alarm bell off in my head.  I've heard that when you can smell the fish it means it's not fresh.

At the same time, our meals were actually quite good.  I had a dinner Bento Box for $8.99, and it was a tonne of food for the price.  I had no complaints about the quality of the beef or of the sashimi or california rolls.  Some of my friends got the AYCE option, and they seemed to enjoy it as well.  Service was fast and reliable too.  And I haven't got sick yet.  The fishy smell still lingers in my mind though.  It's super cheap, so I might be back.  But there are many other sushi places in the city if you're willing to spend a few more dollars."}
{"text":"Had a delivery order
Menu is rife with spelling errors, at least a dozen (including Vegettarian, Ramein, nuheyaki udon, den kaku, Chicken Karaga ) showing whoever wrote it was neither an English nor a Japanese native speaker. Includes some not-so-Japanese items as \"mango salad\" and chicken salad (chicken and mango) and Cheese wonton.

Food was alright, Miso good, the salad is the same garbage-y salad too many Japanese restaurants tend to think acceptable with some ginger dressing. Gyu-don was subpar, beef too tough, and not much onions. Sushi was good enough, though I felt they skimped on the pickled ginger. Might eat from here again, but would not pick this as my top choice."}
{"text":"I've come to Natural Sushi at least a handful of times now, twice in a large group (10 people) and a couple times in one to one to small groups. Consistency wise, their food is usually good and their service is timely (except at busy hours, when they are a bit slower). Their food here is quite tasty - and cooked well! The prices are good and I like their lunch and dinner combo/boxes. I'm not the biggest fan of the sushi rolls or sashimi here - I think they're better at other places and the fish could be fresher/better cut, but their ramen, teppanyaki and terriyaki marinated meat dishes are great I think, especially the kalbi/short beef ribs and the salmon terriyaki. My friend says the raymun is more filling than Sansotei! They take debit, cash and credit. A nice place to go to a small intimate lunch or dinner date with a friend or S/O, but like I said, I have been with a large group and they've been able to accommodate for us (by pushing smaller tables together at the back), which is quite nice. Like it!"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi places are a dime a dozen in the GTA. Most of them are similar in price so even small flaws can make me take my sushi cravings elsewhere. Natural Sushi is conveniently located close to Yonge/Bloor which is a good location for me. But unfortunately the food fell a little short. 

To me, the most important items in a AYCE sushi place is the sashimi. If I just wanted rolls or the kitchen stuff, I can get probably just get a bento box which is only a fraction of the cost of AYCE option. Natural Sushi has a very narrow selection of sashimi. All they have is Salmon, White Tuna, and Red Snapper. This is disappointing because many places I've tried have these 3 and also Mackerel (one of my favourite), and squid or octopus. They actually had mackerel on the list but it's crossed out. Perhaps even worse than a small selection is that the white tuna was nearly frozen. Ok I know this is Toronto and we shouldn't expect super fresh sashimi but I think they could have at least defrosted the white tuna earlier so it's closer to room temperature. The white tuna was about 40% frozen and I waited about 20 minutes so it'll be more defrosted. The salmon and red snapper were similarly a little cold but not as frozen as the white tuna was. It doesn't help that they cut the pieces really big because the outer layer defrosts more than the inside. 

In terms of other selections, there was absolutely nothing on the AYCE menu that you can't get elsewhere. They have regular stuff like tempura, beef ribs, various standard rolls, and some sushi. We ordered a few items like chicken skewers and tempura. They were delicious. No complaints there. We got the green dragon roll and it was more fragile than I expected. I love green tea ice cream and it's pretty much standard in GTA AYCE sushi places. Nothing beats ending a meal with green tea ice cream. They are actually lacking a few items I expected like udon in a soup but it's not a big deal to me. 

So...the below average sashimi at this place earns it 2 stars. To me, the whole point of AYCE sushi is to eat raw fish as it's something I can't get easily elsewhere. The price point is $17.99 for standard AYCE or $20.99 for a deluxe version. The price is on point. But with sashimi like that and a menu selection that offers no advantage compared to other places, I think I'll always have better options at this price range."}
{"text":"This place is great if you are looking for some cheap japanese food, not to fret, the quality of the food are not compromised as a result of the price. I usually get their sushi lunch special which is a great deal at $7.90 tax included. Also, if you sit down and order, their tempura is wonderfully warm inside the tempura sushi roll. Their beef short ribs is pretty tasty also!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Natural Sushi delivery for over three years now, and normally would have given it a 4 star review. However, we ordered again last night, and it was terrible. (last time before that was some time in December 2010 !!)

First off, for some reason the person on the phone taking the order did not understand English, and my friend had to order from her in Mandarin - for a Japanese restaurant.....
(I never had any issues before)

Once the food came, it was packed awkwardly, and not as efficient as before. They used to put all the soups and salads in separate containers (this did happen). As well as, Rice, meats, different dishes, all in separate bowl like containers. This is what used to happen. 
This time, all the bento boxes were in one big Manchu Wok style square container filled to the brim. It's not very sturdy, and one dish even leaked meat juice everywhere on the floor just by holding it. 

The food itself was different too. The Spare ribs were thick and didn't have much marinade on it, like before. My friends told me the rolls were not as tasty either. The \"Beef Teppenyaki\" = Bulgogi had very stringy meats in there. 

One thing was the portions were HUGE. I actually have lunch for the next few days now. They also had the meat on top of some fried veggies , which is different than before too. 
Usually they also give you free spring rolls and a bunch of other things especially for a big order. 

I don't know, something happened. 
And looking at these reviews, maybe next time I should choose a delivery place that I've actually been to before!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this restaurant and I have to say, I was more impressed this time.  I ordered just about every maki roll possible (dynamite, gold dragon, spicy salmon), some sushi and chicken wings.

All the items were quite good with the exception of the red snapper sushi.  I would rate the quality of food as 3.5/5, however I definitely have to bump up one star because of the price.  $11.99 for AYCE is a steal in this area when Aji Sai is 14, Spring Rolls is around 16 and Fushimi is around $15.

Great for business lunches."}
{"text":"I like this place. Let's start with the positives. The food can be pretty inexpensive. There is a bento for 6.99. There are happy hour specials that include some nibbles and a beer for 7 - 9 dollars. The AYCE dinner is only like $17.99. The booze is also cheap. You can get a 1 litre pitcher of house beer for 4.99. The food is also huge in portion size. The rolls are big. Healthy portions of veg and chicken in the bento. Tea is free. Very nice.

The negatives - the food is just average, not stellar. The maki with the bento is sometimes pre-made leading to mushy rice. Rolls made to order don't seem to suffer that problem. There are way too many big fish in a very tiny fish tank. It isn't humane. 

Moral of the story - It's almost next door to work so I will keep going back for sure. Can't go wrong with cheap dinner and beer."}
{"text":"On our way to see Spike Jones' HER, I convinced my girlfriend to give this place a try. I used to frequent them for their lunch specials long ago, and figured it would be an affordable and decent choice exactly on the route to the Varsity theatre, giving us ample time to secure top notch seats. In this neighbourhood, either you splurge and go to WOW! Sushi, or you spend an hour figuring out which of the non-WOW! places to go, since they're all pretty much the same by comparison.

I was a bit worried about my recommendation on first arrival, as we were seated within earshot of a man who sounded like he was trying to wrestle an aggressive squirrel that had loosed itself inside his throat...using his throat. Thank goodness we weren't already eating. Thank goodness he left. 

The restaurant exhibited one of my pet peeves times a thousand: menus already stuffed with way too many options with distinctly disparate pages tacked on to the end with specials and added options, tabletop sign holders with even more hidden specials on both sides, and even more specials and added menu items posted all over the walls. We had to change our order 3 or 4 times because we kept finding specials that were upgrades on our previous option.

We finally settled on their sushi special A, and a dinner special that came with a pint of their house beer. We received two plates filled with Green and Gold Dragon rolls, Rainbow rolls, California rolls, Dynamite rolls, Spicy Butter Fish rolls, and a standard set of sushi. It was all delicious.

GOOD - The service was frequent and prompt, and the sushi was as good as any other place in the area. If you can find them, the happy hour specials are amazing value.

*Alkey Alert* - the beer prices are buck-bananas. I think the house beer is 2.99 a pint and 5.99 a pitcher. It's almost like they're paying you to get drunk! (Or you could order a bottle of wine for 30 dollars, and be a completely insane person that orders a bottle of wine at a low-key yonge street sushi place.)

BAD - it's not the most beautiful interior. One of our sushi specials didn't come with Miso/Salad which was odd (I guess it was replaced by the beer? Either way, Miso and Salad should just come with every combo everywhere).

UGLY - My girlfriend observed the fish tank at the back was way too small for the giant fish held inside. Also, the guy with Black Lung at the table across from us.

Overall, the sushi looked good and tasted good, the service was fine, and we left well fed. It's no WOW! but nothing is. There's no reason you shouldn't stop in here for a beer and a combo."}
{"text":"Service was not the best, subpar sushi. Went there for my first time and I was thoroughly disappointed. I ordered a dish and the seaweed inside was not fresh as it tasted like old fish, very nauseating. I expressed my dismay to the manager and her first response was \"I told you it was seaweed \" and not \"I'm sorry\". I didn't eat the roll and when the bill came I was not surprised to still see it on the bill. When the manager came over I showed her that I didn't eat the rolls and she was like \"can I make you something else?\" Which I answered no because everyone else  was done eating and quite frankly the other rolls I ate were not good. She asked what she could do and I said \"do what you think is best for the customer\". She walked away and did not offer to compensate me or remove the charge off the bill of the un-eaten sushi. Safe to say they clearly value money over customer satisfaction. Will never go back there."}
{"text":"Ahh sushi.. 

I've been to so many places that I liked yet so many that I've hated. This ones kindof the latter. 

I normally judge the restaurant by the smell first before eating, thank god I ordered take out because this place smelled awful.

I ordered the green dragon, a special house one, California and got dumplings( I thought they were veggie..) Dumplings were just really bad. All the rolls tasted old, soft and had a weird fish smell( I would understand if I ordered anything with fish but I didn't) The rolls also weren't wrapped properly, falling apart before I even ate it. 
The only good thing that came from this was my tempura lol"}
{"text":"Great value for lunch ayce. Love that tea comes in a pot, portions aren't huge in of themselves however it's all you can eat so three or four piece rolls let you try more. The salmon sushi was particularly well put together. Seaweed salad was tasty. Not a dessert person at lunch so the option of a single bite size tempura banana slice was the perfect ending. The service was friendly prompt and efficient.  Clean space with good room between tables etc."}
{"text":"$11.99 for AYCE sushi? I'm down.
Add $1 Friday - Sunday.  Still down.

The food was delicious.  The menu was limited.  The spicy salmon roll was succulent.  The waitress was far too sassy.  

We got in at 3pm and ordered everything we were gonna eat right away.  Last call was at 3:30pm.  The non-polite waitress was busy flirting with the electrical guy.  Absolutely horrified by the awkward display, we looked on and judged.   Then 3:35 flew by and she wasn't back.  When she finally walked over to us, I've gotta say, I did not appreciate her choice walking style: the leisurely stride.   I ordered the red bean ice cream and it was good.

I wanted more ice cream but she was like, \"last call was at 3:30pm, I told you that before\"...lady, come on now. It's not like I wanted some dynamite maki. It's not like I wanted shrimp tempura and you were gonna have to defrost some shrimp, break the face and legs off with your bare hands, then dip it in batter and deep fry it  then diute some soy sauce and call it tempura sauce and slam it on the table for me.      

And for THAT reason alone, I'm not going back. Not because I was super offended, but because there are just TOO many sushi places in this city for me to have to put up with ANYTHING.  

Also, those fish ARE alarmingly too big for that fish tank. Where is PETA at? They can't even get a good turn in the tank.  If one fish was like, \"hey look over there,\" the other fish would be like, \"I can't brah, tanks too small\"  Anyone can see that for such a small tank there shouldn't be TWO large fish (see the photos).  

Anyway, check this place out if you're into cheap sushi.  Just know that there might be traces of sass on the menu.

4 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of shabby decor-wise but the food is really great value for the price. The sushi has generous servings of fish, not overwhelmed by rice, and they have some interesting rolls on the menu. The AYCE is a little limited in variety, but the quality is high."}
{"text":"I left my umbrella there two days ago. I left it at my seat, not the front door! I called them a few hours later and asked them to look for me. Their attitude was completely unacceptable! They said \"no, we didn't see it.\" immediately without asking around. Such dishonest and rude people."}
{"text":"All you can eat at a good price (the price pretty much sums the best of this restaurant up).

No sashimi for lunch (but that's on par with all the all you can eats). Sushi rolls were not bad - average sushi place, so you get your typical orders of california rolls, salmon roll, etc etc.

There's a lack of service and almost a hesitating nervousness type of service. This is circumvented by the paper that you mark on to order. They do come pick up your order once in a while.

Restaurants was pretty much empty on a saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"This place got a lot of bad reviews on Yelp but I had a good time here. Food was yummy and service prompt. My only complaint is that the sashimi is cut in giant portions... which can lead to the middle of the fish slab being cold, and it also affects your soy sauce to yummy fish ratio when dipping.

I'll try this place again in the future."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 *

It's hard but sometimes, you do judge a restaurant by its exterior - and in this case, I thought that this place was going to be terrible. Not only was the exterior small and unnoticeable, but the interior was even worse, dim lighting, and pretty much a hole in the wall, not knowing who is going to walk into here next. 

Since my dad and I could have lunch together, I'll just let him take control and order the rolls he craves - which includes the catepillar roll (he never eats veg so bonus points for the avocado), and I wanted a eel, without shrimp tempura, so I believe the one I got was the golden natural roll, or something of that nature.

When the rolls came out, I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh the ingredients look. The avocado was bright green, very delicately sliced and layered closely together. The pieces were very big, and the rice of good temperature. With every bite I took, the roll did not completely fall apart and the seaweed was was not soggy and broke off willingly. 

The spicy tuna that topped the eel roll was not overly hot, but had a nice kick to it. I wish there was a little bit more eel but I really cannot complain. 

It's hard to say that this place is amazing because you can never judge a sushi place until you can taste the freshness of the sashimi. But for what ti's worth, I think the rolls definitely were very tasty. Considering this is the yonge and bloor area, the prices are pretty standard, and specialty rolls are at $8 - 9 each. But if you'd like to cheap out for a low budget lunch, they have a few options that would not disappoint. 

Happy hour also applies so beer and drink lovers should stop in for an afternoon break."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the top AYCE places I have been to in Toronto, aside from Aji Sai at Queen and Spadina.

I don't understand the negative reviews at all. Their AYCE menu is short and sweet, sashimi was VERY fresh and well cut. The rolls were great too, not too much rice - just the perfect rice to fish ratio.

Service was quick and there was nothing from what we tried that I didn't like. I would absolutely come back here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service here is not great...I \"chose the all you can eat sushi\". The waitress who was serving me took her sweet time and recommended I should place small orders. I wasnt ordering a lot in the first place. After ordering 6 pieces of sushi, I requested another order. The waitress took my order sheet and never gave me another option to order again. I paid my bill of $25 for 12 pieces of sushi and felt ripped off and left. I wont be coming again!!!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but I've had better sushi for the same price. Also, the waiter was pretty rude as if he's unwilling to serve."}
{"text":"Just ok. Nothing too special to make it stand out. I am generally a fan of AYCE menus and theirs was quite well laid out and had plenty of options to consider.
Would return, but maybe to try out the lunch options."}
{"text":"Sushi is my favourite place on Yonge Street to grab all you can eat lunch on the Yonge strip. 

You don't come for the service, although don't get me wrong the staff are friendly. You come for the price of the food that you get at a not-too shabby quality.

Been coming here for years."}
{"text":"Attempt #2 at sushi in toronto. Also, failed attempt #2 at sushi in toronto..

First of all, i made the glutton mistake of ordering the all you can eat menu. i was starving! and vancouver sushi is EVERYWHERE (in vancouver) and AYCE is quite trustworthy. in toronto, i've learned that this is not the case. 

the sushi was NASTY. i had a salmon hand roll, couple rolls and a few nigiri. the nigiri was the absolute WORST. the piece of fish on top of it looked like it had been frozen for years and then briefly defrosted in the microwave. the rolls had barely any fish ... and then it was crammed with some sort of ... bread tempura crispy thing?? SO WEIRD. i've never had that in my life! it was like they were trying to stuff it with something to take up space ... only it tasted atrocious. 

ummm yeah. so i feel bad for trashing them since they didn't do anything to me. they had this broccoli tempura that i thought was pretty cool .. the miso soup and green salad were good. cheap beer on pitcher!

but they should stay away from sushi. or hire a better sushi chef. i'm giving up on sushi in TO! these two experiences have been blasphemous to japanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"This has become my go-to place for sushi if I'm in the downtown Yonge Street area.  It's a nice, quiet place.  That being said, I would recommend this place for a quiet business meeting or a meet up place for you and your date that you met on Tinder, Grindr, or The Stamp Collectors Looking for Love app.  

I typically go during the afternoons during the All You Can Eat lunch time which entails you to check off a paper list of items that \"all you can eat\" using an Ikea pencil which all came to about $17 before tip."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times and the place is pretty good. The lunch specials have 12 sushi rolls which have plenty of fish in there and not overloaded with rice which is great. It comes with a side of salad and miso soup for around $10. I'm always beyond full when I have this.

I also tried their all you can eat buffet but was more disappointed at the food. The sushi is similar but the other dishes weren't very good. The chicken karaga was soggy and full of dough rather than meat, the soup was a little tasteless and the dim sum was overcooked. The service was extremely slow too even though there were only two other tables in the entire restaurant and two waiters available. If you're coming here for lunch during work hours, you will not be able to have a decent lunch without being late getting back to work. 

I was little disappointed that they didn't have beef ribs or sashimi. But for $12.99, you can't really expect too much. Decent place, decent food so if you're there for a casual lunch, I think it's a pretty good place to go without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"The food and price were really good! The service was a little slow and some items were missed, but that happens fairly frequently at these all you can eat places. Overall definitely a good experience!"}
{"text":"If you do not wish  to see an unprofessional waiter then avoid this place. Earlier I decided that i am going to give 3 stars, but after i left the restaurant  i decided not to give 3 stars anymore.  The food was decent. The soup was way better than the Spring Rolls. However the thing that really pissed me off was the rude waiter. It seemed like most of the waiter inside this restaurant do not like their job.  I asked the guy nicely If i can split checks on multiple credit/debit cards. He just refused me right in front of my face like he didn't understand what i was asking. Or he just didn't want to do it.  I was shocked cuz all the restaurant I been to accept that. This was the only the place that didn't accept it. I mean I paying for the food so i have the right to choose if i want to pay with my credit card or cash or w.e.  At the end i spent so much $ on my credit card. So I didn't give them tips at all. I did enjoy the food but after being slapped in the face I will never go back again."}
{"text":"The food here is not good. Not really recommend it. I love sushi but so far this place is the worst for sushi"}
{"text":"Decent sushi with generous fish portions at a good price. I would come back here.

All sushi and rolls had large amounts of fish in each piece. Thankfully each roll had only 3 pieces (special rolls have 4) because otherwise I would have been full very quickly due to the size of each piece. Most of the fish I ate was good, but one piece of butterfish wasn't aged enough and was chewy and watery. Chicken karaage was lacking Japanese mayo and initially they said they didn't have any but brought some later. The avocado salad has a lot of avocado which is great, but the dressing they use for the salad is very watery (or maybe the lettuce is very watery and needs  

Service was very poor. The waitress was generally disinterested in serving tables and does not make eye contact with customers (!?). When you walk in the front door, the sushi chefs who work at the front aren't going to acknowledge you, so ideally the waitress should pro-actively greet people entering.... but she doesn't. Free WiFi password was sushi123

The washrooms are disgusting. Downstairs is a unisex washroom with 2 stalls (one seemingly permanently out of order) and two sinks. There's lots of graffiti, the flooring and washroom and sinks are of a very old style."}
{"text":"I stopped in because \"why not?\". I was looking for something different so I tried something different. I tried their Rainbow Roll. It wasn't bad just nothing different to make it stick out. 

I think it's a good choice in a pinch but I don't think it will be jumping to the top of my list when I've got them Sushi cravings. 

Service was quick and efficient and the staff were courteous. Yet, there is little to draw me back here. Maybe one day...."}
{"text":"The food was actually really tasty here! With tax, lunch on the weekend came to about $17.
Our server was nice, some of our orders were messed up but it wasn't a huge deal for me.
I liked all the rolls I tried. Even ones I usually don't like, I found tasty here.
The salmon on the nigiri was thick and I usually hate the fake crab in sushi but I liked it here.
The rolls come in rounds of three which is nice if you want to try a bunch of different kinds... Which you know you do.
The ice cream and fried bananas were wicked. The cooked dishes were good too.
Not a bad, little spot!"}
{"text":"Against my better judgement, I went in there, and it was quite a while ago.  One star is too generous for this place.  First off, the guy had PRE-CUT slices ... and they were way too cold to be served, borderline frozen.  I was livid.  I asked him where he got his training (rhetorical question I suppose).  This was a while ago and I can only hope that they've changed the place.  If I think of the worst \"sushi\" experience I have ever had, this is it."}
{"text":"I go to this sushi joint when I'm too lazy to cook. I always order the sashimi roll and unagi roll. I think the unagi roll is not worth it after a few times. The first time I had it, it was good with avocado on top and a lot of eel but the second I got it, there was barely ANY unagi. $5 is way out of reach. 

My boyfriend ordered the unagi don and it looked good and tasted pretty decent."}
{"text":"Not the worst Sushi around, but not much better than the worst.

Some of the items were OK - Shrimp tempura, S & S shrimp, but the Chicken Karaage was inedible, and the chicken wings were among the worst I've had.  Both types of chicken were so bad that I didn't want to get told off by the staff and charged extra for not finishing them (see other reviews) - so I put them in my pocket to take home for my dogs.

The beef short-rib was a little overcooked, but they did cook them less for round two when I asked.

Sadly, the Dynamite roll (with Shrimp Tempura inside) isn't the great experience you get at some places where they serve it to you with the shrimp still hot/warm.   Room temperature here.

I suppose I can live with the quality - but I'll try to fine better alternatives in the area, and there are certainly much better quality spots out there."}
{"text":"I brought a group of coworkers here and the first thing that hits me is this fishy smell in the restaurant.  In addition, the lighting is very dim and makes the dining experience gloomy.  I ordered their salmon bento box special for $10.00 and a pitcher of their house beer which was only $15.99.  I would have given this place 4.5 stars but the waiter who was serving my group was very rude.  Her tone of voice seemed like she did not want to serve us and she would rather talk with her coworkers than to serve us. Overall, good cheap quality food but the service ruins the experience."}
{"text":"AYCE is a cheaper price than most. and has a good amount of items to choose from.  Sushi is good depending on which sushi chef you get. A little heavy on the tempura flakes if it's in AYCE rolls. Food is good, not amazing but nothing to complain about. Service good.  I come here if I don't have a lot of time for lunch.  They don't have edamame on the AYCE, which for me is disappointing.  Free wifi!  CHEAP lunch specials. EXTREMELY CHEAP BEER!!"}
{"text":"I am rating this according to AYCE standard. Their lunch AYCE is a great value for your money. The selection isn't big but it has most of the standard items (with the exception of eel). The fish is fresh and rice ti fish proportion is good. Their hot items always come out...well, hot. And service is really attentive. So I would give its lunch AYCE 4 stars.

Its dinner AYCE however, is another story. The deluxe option is not worth it. The sashimi was sliced extremely thinly and the rolls were rather sloppy. Some of the rolls were already almost unwrapped when the waitress brought them to our table. The spider roll barely has any soft shell crab in it and the avocado pieces were overwhelmingly ginormous in the unagi and avocado rolls (one or two pieces of the unagi and avocado roll have a relatively large chunk of unagi while most have 95% avocado + 1 miniscule morsel of unagi bit). Definitely not worth the money. I would give it 2 stars based on price and quality."}
{"text":"They have some cheap happy hour combos.

Their AYCE menu is pretty big BUT they tend to use tempura batter as filling in their rolls which is shiesty."}
