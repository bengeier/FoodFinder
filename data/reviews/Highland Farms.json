{"text":"This afternoon I stopped by Highland Farms and I was really impressed. The produce was immaculate, bright and blemish free. They also carry lots of exotic produce you don't normally see at every other grocery store. The bagged lettuce and mixed greens were priced lower than some other stores. 

This location also has lots of gluten and dairy free products. The prices are mostly lower than their competitors on items including dairy free cheese, and dairy free yogurts. 

Some items that were priced higher than normal included Sweets from the Earth cupcakes and other gluten free desserts.

All over, I would definitely return to this location to shop for produce and dairy free goods."}
{"text":"The customer service here is out of this world. This store is incredibly clean, the staff are incredibly nice and have always gone above and beyond, exceeding my expectations. The organics are a great price here, and they have great sales. I enjoy some of the baked goods from time to time, and I find that Highland Farms has dairy options that are not available elsewhere. I love coming here. They recently significantly lowered a lot of their prices, likely to maintain competition as there are so so many stores within a 2-km radius, and it definitely keeps me coming here. The avocados were on sale recently (I did get some), and then a few days later they sold out, lol, so it must be working. I do wish they were busier because I want to make sure this store hangs around."}
{"text":"My all time favourite spot for grocery shopping, out of all highland farms, this location is the closest to my residence, the newest and best looking out of the bunch.

This location have been opened for about a year now, but it hasn't been doing too good, in my opinion.
With some rough competition in the area, with better pricing at most times, this place is left neglected!
It's always deserted and empty no matter what day or time you visit..it's too bad since it is the cleanest place to shop groceries, everything is so neat and put together nicely, there is always maintenance, shelves are always stacked and you find rare things that you can't find elsewhere.

Prices are a little higher than other competitors in the area, which is causing them to loose alot of customers.
Their meet and poultry freshness is second to none, simply the best spot to bbq from!
I hope they can figure out a way and follow a strategy to reduce prices and attract more traffic, I would hate to see it fail due to lack of marketing & sales strategy."}
{"text":"Very clean and well organized. This location carry variety of yogurt and size that other store lacking. Good service at ready to eat food sections."}
