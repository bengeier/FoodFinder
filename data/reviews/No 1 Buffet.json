{"text":"This place sucks we went and tried the Buffett all the food was cold , Not worth the trip, at least when we went they gave a discount because of their grand opening. It would of made me ILL if I would have paid full price. Would not recommend this place to any one"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a pretty average place. It is brand new or so that is what I've been told. There is Chinese food with some American food. If you're looking for nicely prepared sushi, that's not what you will find here. There is a lot of fried food, which I didn't like. I wouldn't recommend to come here with a big group. Make sure you like Chinese food before you come here. I did enjoy the rice, both fried and white. But this is still a new buffet, so it has time to grow."}
{"text":"Would not recommend. There's better Chinese food elsewhere. Also there was a flea on our table, which makes me question the cleanliness. Lastly it was so hot and steamy in there that the windows were very wet. Felt like I entered a sauna. Definitely won't go back there."}
{"text":"Good quality for the price.   I have eaten here many times. The staff is very friendly always there to help.   I recommend this buffet over any other in the area."}
{"text":"Ok so this is a review for what this restaurant really is- a fairly typical Chinese American buffet.  It is not fancy and the food is not amazing, but it is a good deal and there is a decent amount of interesting seafood items and sushi if you want it.  In particular, I was surprised how tasty the fried frog legs were and the fried fish was also well fried and fresh.  There were no unfortunate GI effects after eating and my stizeable takeout portion on a Sunday was $5.50.  Much much better than fast food at the same price.  Seems like a nice business to support and while you're at it, come check out my church which is located next door on Sundays at 10 AM!"}
{"text":"Nice people, very friendly... But the food was not good at all. I was looking forward to some salmon, but what they had under the label \"Salman\" looked entirely inedible so I didn't try it. Their \"stuff\" mushrooms were awful... They tasted like what I imagine dishwater tastes like. Everything else that I tried was squarely in the \"not getting that again\" category. So, I finally got an opportunity to try this new restaurant but I wish I hadn't. I have a strange oily aftertaste and I don't feel very well... But I imagine I'll have an early dinner tonight because I left hungry."}
{"text":"Just ordered chicken Pud Thai, Fried Crab Meat Cheese Wontons, & egg rolls. Not including delivery or tip, the total came to $15.30. Delivered to me within 30 mins of ordering on Yelp Eat 24 app. Super easy & fast. When the food arrived I had to wait ten minutes or so before opening the stapled closed paper bag. All food was packaged perfectly and included additional sauces as well as my side of sweet & sour sauce (about half a cups worth) - they did not charge extra for. All my food was very hot!!! This was awesome for me as I was afraid it'd be cold after having to wait to eat. All food was a 10 on the delicious scale, 1 being awful and 10 being perfect. However, the wontons were a tad over baked. I would definitely order here again and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Very good food I was pleasantly surprised,and seemed to be family run . I love to see a happy family working together ."}
{"text":"The host and waitresses were nice, but the food was below average.   You can do better."}
{"text":"This is a fairly typical Chinese buffet for Cleveland, they put out a nice variety of items, the problem is that the food quality is not up to most of the other buffets that are around.  Located in a strip mall on Lorain Road in North Olmsted, once inside the decor seems a bit dated.  The food selection at lunch is a bit more diverse then some other buffets, they had fried shrimp, spicy shrimp along with the usual items.  However the food had been sitting too long and were just not that tasty.    I would say that you probably want to pass on this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this was typical of most Chinese buffets I have been to - the food is plentiful and diverse, but leaves me feeling kind of nauseous within the hour."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese buffet around. The whole family loves it and that includes a 1 year old and a picky 8 year old. It's very nice that they have the ice cream individually wrapped so that area doesn't become a mess. I love the fish and seaweed salad."}
{"text":"Very few options for a Chinese buffet. Went at 7:00pm on a Wednesday night. A lot of the food was cold and the sweet and sour chicken was rock hard. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Chinese buffet I've ever seen... Possibly even some of the worst food ever in my entire life!!  Do yourself a favor and eat frozen Mac n cheese before you go to this place!  My mother and I complained that everything was cold or just plain bad.... The manager/owner yelled at us because we told him there was no way we were going to eat any of his food let alone pay for it.  He literally screamed at us that whether we ate or not we still had to pay.  Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here maybe once a month or so. As far as the food, it's kind of hit or miss. During busy times the food is obviously fresher, and during slower times it's less consistent. So it's definitely better to go when it's busier. The selection they usually have is decent, and the food quality is pretty good. The crab rangoon, and hot and spicy chicken are both really good. I love to eat the baked crab stuff (imitation crab baked w/ mayo) that is at most Chinese buffets, and it's pretty good here. It's not overly greasy or full of weird fillers. The main reason we come here is because the people who work here are nice. The guy who cooks often comes out and talks to guests, especially regulars, and listens to their feedback about the food. The place is fairly clean, and the food has never made me sick. The price is fair at $8.99 for the buffet on Sunday. So, all in all, we do like it. It's not the best Chinese buffet I've ever had, but it's not bad, and we'll continue to go here unless we find something better."}
