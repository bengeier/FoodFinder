{"text":"Worst BBQ I've had...St. Louis style ribs were dry and very fatty.  The waitress openly advised us that she was having a bad day and we wud have to deal with it!!  On the upside, the hash brown casserole was amazing!  Overall, very disappointed...I was really hoping it would knock my socks off:("}
{"text":"Great food. Decor needs work. One note,when we walked one girls was smoking by the register, not something you want to see.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I patronized the restaurant about 2:00pm. I was the only one there. The girl at the counter was not friendly in the least bit. In fact I had to greet her. I asked what was their specialty or what she recommended and she replied \"nothing\". She acted like she hated her job and I was bothering her. I was stunned.  
   So much for the service...now the Q. I ordered 1/2 lb of brisket and pulled pork. Strangely, very little smoke flavor. No smoke ring. The brisket was chewy and the pulled pork was very dry and tasted like it was three days old.
   I was very disappointed. I will not be back. If you're interested, I'd hurry because I doubt they'll be there long."}
{"text":"This wouldn't be five-star BBQ in Texas, it would be four-stars, but it is six-star worthy in Northeast Ohio. It is 100% legit and the best Texas-style I've had outside Texas. If it weren't a ridiculous idea, I would have sworn they were flying it in from Lockhart. 

I had brisket, collards, and green beans. Boyfriend had baby back ribs, sweet potato fries, and mac and cheese. We tried all the sauces that were on the table; Texas Sweet and Hot was my favorite, I would have liked to try the straight hot sauce but they didn't have any out. We both really enjoyed everything we tried. I don't know why you would go anywhere else on the west side for BBQ, say, for example, a place in Avon Lake, when Rotuno's is 100 times better and only 15 minutes further away. 

These are my wishes for Rotuno's: (1) That it stays in business. (2) That they get a food truck and serve in Cleveland or open a lunch place downtown, they would kill it. (3) That they sold all of the meats on the side, and not just ribs and chicken. I tried to get just a sausage, but the waitress wouldn't sell me one without buying an entire extra dinner. It would be great if they could do it true Texas style and weigh add-on meats by the pound. Or just serve it all by the pound and forget the meals, which didn't have great combinations... Or if they had like, a pick two plate or pick three plate for a certain amount. ... Oh man, who am I kidding, I'll keep going back when I'm craving BBQ no matter what, it was outstanding. (4) The decor could be more authentic, and would lend alot to the restaurant, but let's be honest, you can't have an awesome picnic table setup outside in Ohio since there are actual seasons here, but it would still be sweet to have inside. Maybe when they renovate they can make it a little more Texan in there. 

This is one of the few times I'm happy to live in a west side suburb, because it just makes the drive to Rotuno's that much shorter."}
{"text":"Make sure you look at their website as their location has changed.
It is mostly a take-out place but they do have some tables where you can enjoy your food.

They are set to sell by the bulk, so make sure you are either very hungry or have friends to help. They do have a sampler plate that gives you more than plenty of food. My plate included brisket, pork and sausage.

Their brisket was cooked to perfection and juicy.  The pork was fork tender and the sausage was very well smoked.  The sauces are a great complement as they don't over power the meats flavor and adds that kick.

Beans were very good and not loaded with sugar or molasses as to make them like candy, chunks of brisket in them gives them a great flavor.

Place is small and very clean  Service was above par and very friendly.

Price was very adequate."}
{"text":"This place puts Texas back in my heart. The brisket is nice and tender. There is a wonderful variety of sauces. The fresh cut fries are worth the drive alone! 

Prices are a bit high, but I'll pay for quality food, and this is certainly it."}
{"text":"This place can be hit or miss for me.  I'm always happy with the St. Louis style ribs and the pulled pork.  I've been less than satisfied by the brisket and chicken.  Both were a bit dry for me.  The cheesy potatoes are my go-to side dish.  Their baked beans are also fantastic.  The cole slaw used to be a favorite and suddenly they started adding way too much pepper.  The Texas sheet cake is also very good.  I have never eaten in at Rotuno's, but I have used the take out window and walked in for take out.  The staff has always been very friendly."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Went there for lunch on Friday. Only 1 other person eating there (oh, oh!). My partner had BBQ chicken (leg & thigh). Very bony/little meat. I had Texas sausage & brisket. All entrees were cooked sometime in the semi-distant past and reheated. Dry and flavorless. Their 3 sauces were average, at best. Sides (slaw, fries& \"cheesy potatoes\") were easily forgettable. Lunch for 2 cost $22. Staff was friendly, but this is one that I'll never be back to."}
{"text":"In short, I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I wouldn't drive the hour away from Cleveland Heights just for it. I was in the area, and checked it out. If I'm around there again, I'd definitely go back.  

On to the food: I tasted my friend's turkey & pulled pork.  The smoked turkey was cooked well & juicy, but almost no smokiness, seemed average. The pulled pork was good. I had the baby back ribs which I thought were perfectly cooked...they didn't fall of the bone, but they pulled off the bone easily, had a good bark, and were juicy. I also had the smoked sausage which was full of flavor & had a good smokiness. My biggest issue was that I could have used everything (except maybe the sausage) to have a bit smokier flavor. But, I'm a fan of heavier smokiness...I think my mother would have loved it, as she doesn't like things with very strong smokey flavor.  

The cheesy potato side was good, the mac & cheese was creamy. I salted & peppered both sides for personal preference, but the mac & cheese needed it more as it lacked in flavor. 

They had 4 sauces on the table, & their tangy & sweet house sauce was the standout bbq. The sweet bbq was good, but I'm not a big sweet bbq fan. That being said, it was one of the better sweet bbq sauces I've had.  I really want to try the smoked wings next time, mainly so I can try the New York Garlic sauce, that was like a buffalo garlic on the table. I tasted it & it tasted delicious. I bet it would go great on that turkey I mentioned earlier that was juicy, but lacked any smoke/bbq flavor.  

So yeah, it was good, maybe better than good...but not good enough to drive to Elyria specifically for. Will def stop again if i'm over there tho, and recommend people in the area to try it!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. The staff was very nice and attentive. I got the pulled chicken sandwich, and it was delicious. I also got the sweet potato fries an they were nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside--very good. They give you a variety of sauces to choose from, ranging from mild to very hot. Every time I drive by here it smells amazing. The decor needs some work, but overall it was very good."}
{"text":"Good place to get real BBQ. Pulled pork and brisket are outstanding. Chicken and ribs are good, so are the sides. Tim also has several types of BBQ sauce to use. We love to eat here and will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"The door says \"Texas Style Barbecue\" and inside you'll find a sign describing what a smoke ring is and why it's important.  For an Ohio joint, this is an encouraging sign.  

We asked for the recommendations and were told to try the pulled pork or the brisket so we ordered one of each.  The pulled pork was definitely the winner.  The meat is shredded and without sauce so you can choose from the variety of sauces at the table.  Smoky flavor and crispy ends but a bit dry.  The brisket was less successful in that it was drier and tougher and absolutely needed sauce.

Surprisingly, the sides were the real stars on the plate.  Sweet potato fries were delicious, crispy and served with coarse salt.   For someone who grew up on collards, Rotuno's collards were just right...smoky with shredded pork and just enough tang.  The mac and cheese was thick and creamy.    The Texas Toast was decadent and reeked of garlic.

They have a kids menu at $4 and the restaurant has a casual takeout feel so it would be a good family choice for a change of pace.  There was a steady stream of pick up orders walking out the door so it's obviously garnered fans in the short time it's been open."}
{"text":"It is kind of in an unexpected location, next to a flea market. If you like BBQ, this place is the best around, hands down! The prices are very reasonable, and the combos are definitely enough for 2 to share. Baby back ribs were fall off the bone, cooked to perfection, and delicious!"}
