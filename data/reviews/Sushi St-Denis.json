{"text":"Been there many times. It's hella busy, reserve for peak hours, or wait in the line up. Very decent quality for the price, vast selection. Perfect for groups with varying tastes, vegetarians, fish-phobes , ect."}
{"text":"Sushi à volonté rue Saint-Denis. 190 mets différents à la carte ! J'y ai très bien mangé (aka je me suis bien gavé). Tout ce que j'y ai mangé était bon voir très bon. Le service était assez rapide mais déplorable : pas un sourire, pas un mot... A lire les autres avis, cela semble \"normal\" ici... Le midi, compter 22$ taxes et pourboires compris."}
{"text":"I went there for a birthday so we were a group of 8. We waited a bit before we got served. It didn't seem that busy and a few waiters passed by without really acknowledging us. Nonetheless, after we had asked for some beers and placed our first round of orders, the waiter assigned to us did a great job of coming back and asking if we needed anything.  The food itself was excellent. The salmon sashimi were awesome, and really everything else was great. I don't remember what everything was so its hard to give some recommendations, but we weren't disappointed by anything... For an All You Can Eat place, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The price itself was fairly reasonable given that we had some big eaters among us. Its 30 dollars per person though so if you have a very small appetite it might not be worth it..."}
{"text":"Quick recap: Great selection of all you can eat for a dinner out with family or friends. I dont think there was one thing on the menu that I havent tried and didnt like.   I've read some reviews stating the wait was long, well it does get busy and so reservations are probably a good idea but there's a reason its always packed. You get a pretty good bang for your buck! I'd recommend this resto to anyone."}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi, it has to be fresh and Sushi St Denis not only delivers on that, this place has variety and surprisingly, the beef is amazing as well.  You can taste the difference compared to other places when the rice is done perfectly and not dry. The salmon to white oil fish taste differently and every piece is worth the all you can eat price. This is my second time eating at this place and in between had the chance to try the newly opened Kanda on Decarie and Jean- Talon, I must say the quality is nothing to compare.  My only drawback  for this restaurant is space. It can get quite noisy but really, you forget the noise very quickly with the great service and food quality that rolls out of their kitchen."}
{"text":"Tout simplement dégueulasse!!!!!!!  je suis allé mangé jeudi avec ma femme et une amie mais quelle déception!!!!!! L'accueil inexistant les tables sont sales, mauvaise odeur provenant des toilettes. Et à notre plus grande surprise, il y avait des verres de terre dans les sushi, on croyait pas nos yeux. Après s'être plaint auprès du gérant, il nous les a changé, complètement débile!!!! comme si on pouvait encore manger chez eux. On voulait seulement partir, mais là encore une grosse surprise, on nous fait payer 18 $ chacun et un dollars pour chaque morceau commandé.Ne voulons pas faire une histoire et une dispute devant le monde, on a payé et on est partis. Tout d'abord un gros conseil au patron s'il lit ce message, commencez par licencier le gérant pour le Bien de votre restaurant.... Nous ne reviendrons jamais dans cette endroit. Vivement que la concurrence est là et mille fois plus propre pour pouvoir aller dans une autre alternative que ce restaurant absolument dégueulasse."}
{"text":"The waitress was very rude. We just ask her a simple question and what she answered was shocking!! And their sushi was pretty ordinary...not recommending at all!!"}
{"text":"Sushi excellent, le,meilleur a volonté ou j ai pu aller pour l instant, service un peu bof mais bon, c est rattrapé par la nourriture. Un vaste choix de plat comme boeuf poulet etc vraiment top!"}
{"text":"À volonté certains, en autant qu'on vous oubli pas!! lol J'y suis allé une seule fois à date pour souper et mon coloc 3-4 fois au moins pour les dîners surtout et on a l'impression des fois qu'il y des commande oubliés et on doit les recommander à nouveau. J'imagine que ce sont des cas isolé! ^_^  Le choix immense, les plats sont merveilleux, entre-autres pour le boeuf terriyaki qui est juste trop fondant dans la bouche et juteux et goûteux... les sushi sont frais et bien fait, les nouille sont délicieuse, bonne véariété de saké aussi.  L'ambiance est est super, beaucoup de serveurs/ses, assez qu'on est pu certain c'est qui qui va prendre notre titte feuille si délicate.  Entre collègue au lunch (bon prix) ou soirée (prix ajusté +) de fin de semaine en gang pour dupliquer les plaisir du partage!"}
{"text":"The good was excellent, the service fast.  A bit confusing about identifying what was what when it arrived, but everything tasted good, and a good value for the price"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi.  Pick anything.  Eat it.  Repeat.  Kind service, stellar offerings, nice location right on Saint-Denis."}
{"text":"We have tried close to a dozen all-you-can eat sushi places in Montreal, and this one's our favorite. We usually do the dinner (sashimi is what we really enjoy, and that isn't included in the lunch menu)...Their oil fish is super-tasty, and we haven't come across it being served in other all-you-can-eat sushi places."}
{"text":"Service was quick and courteous, which isn't always the case with all you can eat sushi places. They didn't forget any of the things we ordered either. Food was decent. My friend really liked the grilled eel sushi. I would definitely consider going back if I'm in town and in the mood for all you can eat sushi. I don't think the food was better or worse than at Kanda but the service was better for sure."}
{"text":"Ok the quality here varies massively. Sometimes the quality is great, other times it is cheap, rushed, and stale.    I am also not someone who listens to bitter complaints about service, but I'm gonna have to go ahead here and validate any claims about rude and incompetent service here.  They make mistakes with your order and you are forced to either eat or pay for food you don't want.   Their cocktails were total poison and a waste of money.  Insulting to be honest.  They have an army of staff and they seem to work together to be as disillusioned and rude as they can be. Of course working at a giant food factory pumping out variable quality dishes for what is probably min. wage is uninspiring, but they are not the only ones."}
{"text":"The servers were the rudest I've ever experienced anywhere. I have no idea why they attended everyone around me but treated me like I was invisible. I had to ask for wasabi and was given a tiny amount and a scornful look.  Wouldn't refill my water either.  Is it because I'm American, middle-aged, a woman alone? I don't look or dress weird and none of those reasons are excuses to be ignored. I wasn't even impatient until I walked up to the service station to request some wasabi and 3 waiters acted like the couldn't see or hear me.  I have no idea what I might have done wrong. A horrible experience and not worth the $20 I threw at them as I walked out."}
{"text":"If I can give zero stars I would...  Terrible quality, some ingredients tasted rotten, all of the raw fish were either warm or still frozen, had to literally beg for tempura sauce because it didn't come with the tempura, missed orders...  This is the WORST all you can eat Jap experience I've ever had. Thank god I was just passing by. A place like this definitely won't last long in Toronto."}
{"text":"Worst all-you-can-eat sushi experience of my life.   SERVICE: I ordered only 12 sushis and I still couldn't finish them. The waitress started to scold me in public, pointing out the rice remaining in my plate and talking so loud that all the other customers started looking at me. She charged me 6$ on top of the price of the buffet, even though I hadn't ordered much to begin with, and she counted one sushi-pizza as 4 pieces, hence charging me 4$ for it (even though I had started to eat it but it was so oily that I couldn't finish it).  FOOD: The sushis themselves are very ordinary. They have too much rice and too little fish (probably on purpose to fill up the customers). Everything is loaded with greasy tempura, the sushi-pizza is absolutely atrocious (an oil sponge topped with a mountain of plain greasy tempura).   Go there if you want to have cement in your stomach from eating too oily and too much in order to avoid the extra fee."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place:  Bullet point time:  Pros: -Some of the sushi selection was great! (Fresh and flavorful) -Clean tables and floor  Cons: -Some of the sushi selection was icky! (Too oily / too much mayonaise)  -The toilet was disgusting! and small! and EWWY!   Overall impression, go there to eat, but make sure you take a peepee and wash your hands pre-going there! Also, the waiters weren't too friendly.. a smile here and there would be appreciated! :)"}
{"text":"Il y a malheureusement trop de bons endroits à Montréal pour subir un si mauvais service.  La nourriture n'a rien d'exceptionnelle et l'ambiance très ordinaire. Nous avions réservé et plutôt que de nous accueillir on nous a mit en garde qu'il faudrait quitter rapidement.  Les serveurs n'étaient pas courtois et tout était compliqué.  Autant pour les commandes que la facturation. Je suppose que peu importe le service les gens continuent à y aller donc nullement besoin de nous faire aimer l'expérience."}
{"text":"Hit & Miss - Some of the sushi is great, some of it just isn't. The avocado was so over ripe that it was like baby food. The menu was in a weird order, so you couldn't really order in any normal way.  Service was quick and everything came quickly enough. The spring rolls were served with ketchup? NO!"}
{"text":"Very decent all you can eat sushi place.  I didn't liked the service but the food is good. I really recommend the sushi pizzas and anything with pumpkin. Very yummy.   Excellent place to celebrate a birthday.  I recommend going to the second floor tho"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 1 star because my girlfriend and I were waiting for 23 minutes and 37 seconds for 6 maki sushis, 1 shrimp tempura (I actually ordered 4), and 4 Takoyaki, in a restaurant with 6 diners at 4pm. I also ordered their pizza sushi 3 times, but got none of them.  The waiters were chatting, joking around, and eating. They had this full bucket of F but they didn't give us a single one at all. The service was terrible.  But... but the food was very delicious...  Seriously, sushi was nicely prepared, not too much rice and the taste was just on the money. Other than the Shrimp Tempura being too small and the Gyoza being extremely disgusting to eat, everything else was actually succulent to eat. The Garlic Beef was really tender and juicy while having a really good caramelization, and the seasoning was perfect.  The menu is really huge, but some of them are udon, ramen, or rice dishes. It's a huge bowl and really doesn't worth the money. Despite the variety of choices, the menu was not organized very well, you get starters, then sushi, then deep-fried items, prepared kitchen food, and then...sashimi. Furthermore, their sushi pizza was labeled \"Sushi\", along with 2 other categories of food.  I looked at the way the waitress prepared the Lychee Cocktail, and it was just an insult to all bartenders across the world. It looks even worse than bottled cocktail.  The ambiance was weird, they had about 10 songs on playback which kept on repeating forever, and one of them was chapter 5 of some Chinese audiobook. The washroom was really messy and dirty as well.  Final verdict: everything was terri-bad, but the food was fantastic. Nonetheless, I won't return ever again, and I suggest you to try out other AYCE sushi places."}
{"text":"Meilleur deal pour le sushi a volonté !!  pour seulement 14.99 le midi, le choix est intense ! Il ya des salades, soupes, plats cuisinées, viandes teriyaki, tempura, sushis (pas de sashimi par contre, bouuu ), sushi pizza, cônes, desserts, etc.  Le sushi est SUPER frais. Évidemment, on trouve de la goberge au lieu du crabe et des pétoncles, mais ce n'est pas bien grave, la qualité de la nourriture est vraiment surprenante pour le prix. Pour moi, un bon sushi rime avec un riz tiède. Cela prouve qu'il est frais fait sur mesure. Ici, tout fond dans la bouche. Je vous recommande le boeuf teriyaki et les sushis roll.  Le service est ultra-moyen mais bon, on oublie vite quand on est en bonne compagnie."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant for its perfect location and delicious food.  Being a part of one of the most busy streets in Montreal filled with tourists, this sushi place does its best to keep customers happy with food and service and obviously does not take guests for granted like many other places in touristic areas of Montreal.  Menu is pretty standard with all favourite items you expect to have at any sushi place AYCE.  Staff members work very fast,speak both languages and easily describe the dish from the menu if you have any questions. We got full so fast with the main dishes that there was no room left for dessert, which caring staff offered us, guessing that we must have missed it in the menu.  Will definitely be back here with my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"As we my friend and I were exploring Montréal on his last day visiting, we decided to go to St. Denis Sushi; a place we walked by a few days earlier. We went at approximately 12:45 on a Sunday and were presently surprised to see that it was filling quickly.  The service here was stellar. The staff were prompt, efficient and very considerate. They even swapped our used napkins halfway through our meal.  We opted to take advantage of the All You Can Eat lunch menu which was a great price. The food was excellently prepared. As both of us are avid Sushi lovers, we were very delighted by our experience at Sushi St-Denis.  A place to eat."}
{"text":"Les sushis etait bon, mais le service etait vraiment vraiment mauvais ! Ils ont perdu notre commande 2 fois et il n'etait pas du tot sympathique!  Bref le repas est bon, mais le service est mauvais !"}
{"text":"D'abord, je suis nouveau venu au monde des sushis, j'en suis à ma deuxième tentative. Mais je connais les restos.  Points positifs :  - très bons sushis. Frais, bien présentés, et mes acolytes expertes en sushis ont adoré. - restaurant sympa, bien situé - nous avons été servi très vite  Points négatifs : - nous n'avons reçu qu'environ 75% de notre commande. C'est un menu à volonté, alors ça ne change pas la facture, mais ça manque de professionnalisme (les commandes sont écrites...) - les toilettes sont... Miteuses.  Bref, bonne bouffe, menu immense, resto sympa (sauf les toilettes), mais service très moyen."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best but the service was the worst I have ever experienced at any restaurant in Montreal.  Take your money and choose literally any other restaurant in the city and I promise you will be making a better choice than going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"As others have said, it's a Hit or Miss.  I come here all the time because looooove sushi, and I can eat a boatload. Luckily, it's all you can eat here! The sushi itself isn't 5 star, but it's very, very good none the less. While the menu can be gigantic, it's so much fun to try out all the different things they offer. The place is always packed, but the turnover is very fast. We are always sat right away, or within minutes of entering.  Hit and miss with the service though. Sometimes they remember everything, sometimes they don't. It takes so long between the time you order and the time that everything that you ordered finally arrives, that sometimes you don't realize that there's still more coming, so you end up ordering the next round too soon by accident. So that can be a problem when you're starting to get full because by then it's too late. You're always wondering if a particular dish is taking so long because the place is busy, or if the server/chefs just forgot. That part is the most annoying because you are not sure if you should risk ordering more yet.  I've only ever had the lychee cocktail. I love it because it's super sweety and fruity, but I know not everyone is into that. None of the servers are professional bartenders so sometimes there's too much alcohol or too little, but it suits me fine either way because I'm there entirely for the food.  So if you're coming here, keep in mind that the place is always busy and your orders can easily get lost or mixed up. Don't let that ruin your night though because the food is super yummy that it doesn't matter. My favourites are the Dragon Eye roll, the Phoenix roll, the House Mussels, the Wasabi Mussels, and mango ice cream which is the perfect way to top it all off."}
{"text":"So coming from the west coast, I'm the first to admit; I'm spoiled. Large succulent pieces of sushi. Fresh sashimi. Interesting and unique maki... Unfortunately you will not find that here.  But on my quest to find the best sushi place in Montréal, me and a friend ate here and I walked away extremely disappointed and a little angry (at myself).  I should have known that an all-you-can-eat fixed price menu is synonymous with churn out pieces of \"sushi\" as quickly as possible.  Well, the sushi was room temp and the tempura was cold. No tentsuyu with the tempura and the shrimp tempura was cold.  We ordered tonkatsu and the sauce they put on the side...  it was ketchup. WTF?  The order of tamago tasted like it was made a day ago. Rubbery. Bland.  The dining area was full of empty tables and chairs, so naturally when they wanted to seat people they sat everyone together, rather than spreading people out a bit.  I would say this is tourist sushi.  For those of us who could (and want) to eat sushi every day, pass on this place, don't look back, if you happen to see other people walking in tell them to turn away.  Avoid at all cost!  Zero stars."}
{"text":"I am not a complete fan of this place, but the service was spot-on and when we complained about the hot dining room, they adjusted the air conditioning accordingly. The Chinese guy that served us was very sweet and we really liked the servers. Also, flavors of some of the dishes were really good, but the problem is in the freshness of the fish. I'm from Boston, and the fish is just fresher there. Or so it was on this one occasion at Sushi St-Denis. Although, the grilled Saury was quite good! And the una-ju, though a small portion, was also delicious. See? I'm torn in two directions in this review. So I'm not saying don't go! I think you should. I'm just saying that they need to work on the freshness of the fish."}
{"text":"I have had sushi all over North America and i must say that out of hundreds of places,  this place rankings #2 so far. The taste and flavor are amazing. Extremely fresh. With an extensively remarkable amount of options,  this All You Can Eat establishment in Montreal is a staple to come back to. The price is very affordable for what you get, however the presentation is a little lacking. Fortunately, that was the ONLY draw back! I definitely recommend this place and guarantee i will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is a crowd pleaser and it will satisfy any sushi craving temporarily. From their wide variety of sushis and kitchen dishes, it will please anyones craving. For lunch its about $21/person and $37/person for supper with tax and tip. The spicy salmon, eel, surf clam are decent. They have a large variety of sushi rolls (favorites: the dragon eye roll, pheonix roll, avocado, very god sushi pizza). It is not the best quality but the saying \"you get what you pay for\" is very accurate. The kitchen plates are surprisingly very good (favorites: octopus balls, shrimp tempura, imitation scallop, salmon belly, ramen, very tender/saucy beef teriyaki). The meal is ended with a choice of green tea, red bean or mango ice cream. Making it very refreshing and a great way to end the mean. Overall, service is quick and the food is what you pay for. I enjoy it for an all you can eat sushi and I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Un bon sushi à volonté ! La salle est sympa (même si notre table était un peu trop proche de l'entrée, et donc du courant d'air), rien de particulier en plus. Les sushis étaient vraiment bons, le riz est tendre, l'avocat bien mur, le poisson frais. On a aussi gouté les autres plats, genre poulet teriyaki, brochette de crevette, moules épicées,... et c'était bien bon ! Notre nouvelle place sushi à volonté en centre ville :)"}
{"text":"They have a wide selection of sushi at this restaurant. As well as cooked food etc.  lots to chose from but warning askif not sure how many servings these items come with. If not specified there may be 5-6 so be prepared to eat.    Service is attentive and helpful. They had the most amount of servers running around I've seen which makes for a great experience. There's always food coming and empty plates leaving.   Come hungry as there is so much to chose from.   Warning on bathrooms. They are less than stellar."}
{"text":"Confusing experience going here. I went here with a group of 8 people for lunch, which was $25 per person for all you can eat. Not bad, considering there's a lot to choose from on the menu!   However the ordering experience was a bit confusing. Being a vegetarian, I wasn't sure which items on the menu were vegetarian- it could have helped to place a 'v' beside the items without meat products in them. You order items by writing down the number of the item you'd like on the order sheets provided at the table.  I chose to order some edamame beans, and some rolls which I assumed were vegetarian. The food arrived quickly, but when it did arrive at the table, it was super confusing because we weren't told what items were what. When we inquired what the items were, the waiter was able to tell us what some of them were, but seemed to forget some of them. I then realized the item I ordered turned out to have fish after all, and asked the waiter if any of the rolls on the menu were vegetarian. He told me if I chose an item and wrote vegetarian beside it, they would make the roll without fish. I ordered some rolls again doing as he told, and my food arrived without any fish, so I was relieved about that.   Once or twice we received some items which we didn't order, which was also a bit confusing. Despite the confusion, the food was pretty good.  Oh, and there's a charge for any unfinished food. So make sure you can finish what you order!"}
{"text":"J'ai rarement été déçue en allant là! C'est certain qu'à la quantité de gens présent, on ne doit pas d'attendre au meilleur service en ville. Il arrive quelques fois que les serveurs oublient quelques items de ta commende. Par contre, c'est quand même de la nourriture à volonté. Les sushis sont bons et de qualités. À essayer, les dragons eyes et les moules gratinées épicées du soir. Le poulet teriaki aussi est super! Le midi est vraiment plus abordable!"}
{"text":"Les sushis sont ordinaire. Le service est lamentable ! Peu de serveurs parlent francais ou anglais. Ils sont vraiment pas aimables et ne veulent faire que de l'argent, dans le sens que si tu es deux tu n'aura jamais de banquette meme si le resto est vide! Le resto est petit tu es collee au voisin pour ne pas dire que tu mange avec eux! Et quand tu veux prendre un peu de distance en decollant les tables, ils te l'interdisent! Bien que les sushis sont ordinaire je ne reviendrais pas a cause d'un service  lamantable et d'un endroit trop petit pour la quantité de gens qu'ils veulent acceuillir! Je ne le recommande pas!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, the meal was expensive and completely mediocre. I wouldn't recommend it to my enemies :(   The only good food was the salmon sashimi"}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup cette place de sushi à volonté! Ce n'est pas très cher et c'est toujours de très bonne qualité! En plus, les portions qu'ils apportent sont plus petites et donc tu ne te retrouves pas avec 102 portions en trop que t'es obligé d'engloutir pour ne pas payer le surplus!   Sinon, il faut absolument essayer le sushi pizza!! EXCELLENT !"}
{"text":"All you can eat. Nice menu.  Some food items can be too oily and fatty but service is quick and efficient and waiters keep smiling so good experience. Really enjoyed eating here.. It's proper eat eat eat all you can then get out of here so others can eat eat eat all they can as well :P Not a place for first dates obviously so don't expect class. Place is neat as can be managed, well staffed and you see chefs preparing the food infront of you."}
{"text":"Les sushi sont trés trés mauvais. C'est sushi à volonté mais aprés d'en manger un petit peu, on ne veut plus manger.  Terrible food, terrible waitress, terrible service. The fish and the clams taste so bad, I can't find a word in English or French to describe it. The rice is not the one for sushi, it was too sticky and feels like it stayed for days before serving. We only used one order sheet, cuz our tongue could not afford another order, Also, the waitress with glasses on was arrogant. She rolled eyes to us.  ...Oh I thought the waitress was rude because we spoke mandarin Chinese when we were eating. After reading the others' reviews, I found that a lot of people, regardless of racial or mother tongue, received the same horrible service."}
{"text":"Toujours aussi agréable pour une soirée entre amis, c'est un endroit où je vais régulièrement. Seuls points à redire, parfois il y a des erreurs dans les commandes, des sushis de trop que nous n'avons pas commandé et les toilettes sont ok mais pourraient être nettoyées davantage. Sinon le service est super et courtois."}
{"text":"Decent all you can eat sushi place. A little crowed in the weekend. The salmon rose is my favorite. I also like the chicken rice, so tasty.   I recommend seaweed salad and fish head soup for starter. Warm yourself up before you  eating all the cold sushi. Their noodle is nice as well as the rice. Those are typical Asian dishes.  Following some raw fish. I recommend the white sashimi over the orange salmon ones. try the clams which is half red half white. It is cooked not raw. Order some sushi to your like. But to be warned, they are very filling. Don't order too much for one type of sushi, try several kinds.   For the dessert, they have ice cream. Try green tea flavor which is a special in Japan."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on my last night in Montreal over the summer. It seemed to be pretty popular, and was packed on this particular night. We got a table and got to ordering. Pricing is tricky, as sometimes the things you order and get doesn't show up, but there's a fixed charge on your bill. It would be better to see individually, but since it's all-you-can-eat, it's only one. Plus, this night, there was a lot of wrong orders. Things that one table ordered went to another table and vice versa. Sushi was good though, but I felt like they charged us more than what we got and ordered."}
{"text":"Restaurant de sushi à volonté. Alors comme le nom le dit on se rempli le bedon de beaucoup de sushis, mais on ne s'attend pas au summum de la qualité non plus. La décoration du restaurant est modeste, banquettes en cuir et tables pour 2. Il y a des items dans le menu qui en valent vraiment la peine mais finir avec une facture de près de 80$ pour deux avec taxes et service fait mal à chaque fois. Je dois dire que ce qui est le plus navrant c'est le service qui est pitoyable. Jamais aimable, pas de sourire, on voit assoit brusquement. Il faudrait revoir le service à la clientèle car je ne débourserais plus ce montant si c'est pour être traité comme un indésirable ;) il y a beaucoup trop de compétition sur cette rue pour se permettre un mauvais service!"}
{"text":"First of all, disappointing.  Sushis and service were ok until I pay the bill.   I don't know if I looked like a tourist that evening, but the waitress gave me a weird reaction when I gave her about 20% tip. She even tried to block my way after I had paid the bill. It's the first time something like this happen to me in a restaurant.  This is not happening again for sure."}
{"text":"Positif : Tout prêt de l'UQAM donc le midi si tu as un peu de sous et envie de discuter avec une amie, c'est l'endroit ! Restaurant à volonté et pas besoin de se lever lol  Le truc que j'adore c'est que c'est une commande par table donc les plats arrivent au milieu et on peut partager comme on veut, si tu n'aimes pas ton ami peut le manger aussi lol. Beaucoup de choix, de bons sushi frais, les plats sont vraiment magnifiques.  J'ai adoré le sushi pizza, les crevettes tempura et le buf teriyaki, une merveille ! Toutes les semaines, je demande à mes copines un sushi saint denis !!!!  Négatif : Ils oublient des commandes des fois et vu que le plus souvent tu sais pas à quoi ressemble ce que tu voulais commander, tu te sens bête.  Les glaces ne sont pas très bonnes. ZERO SOURIRE !  Vers la fin du service, tu te sens un peu poussé vers la sortie. donc viens tôt pour pouvoir t'attarder comme tu le souhaites. Ils prennent pas la carte débit mais ont une borne ATM."}
{"text":"great all you can eat place varieties is great and you know its fresh because the amount of people and its on crescent!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I am the first to review.....this place was recommended by a few of my wait staff, they had been several times and said you must try...so I did here is the deal All you can eat for about 25$ per person (I say about cause I always have several things on a invoice and did not pay attention), for this all you can eat sushi, plus ramens, plus mussels, plus tempura...and on and on.  I love this place and it is by far my favourite all you can eat sushi for a couple of reasons 1. the food is  excellent (I mean not the end of the world rolls for sushi...but more than fair), 2. they have such a huge food choice that even someone who does not like sushi will find plenty to choose from 3rd the staff, while very busy and young are very friendly if you take the time to say hello and show them some consideration 4. the food comes out quickly, which is always good for the first order when everyone is starving and impatient 5 well located and an bright decor that works, (one of occasion we got to sit on the second floor terasse over looking St Denis, It's tough to get this able but it is by far the best seat in the house)  Things you should note: they don't serve red tuna, (which makes sense for the price they are asking), they have aw some mussel appetizers, (my first time trying and me like's.mmmmm), their tempura is light and not to thick or greasy, (also me likes), I have yet to try the ramen (cause soup fills you up and a 25$ Ramen would not be my thang)  Other than that it is truly a find...go for it, but be prepared to wait a little as this place is usually full and rolling..."}
{"text":"I've had a good experience here. The sushi was delicious, too bad my stomach couldn't hold any more than I had already consumed.  The wait staff was good, served us in a timely manner. I recommend this place for sure."}
