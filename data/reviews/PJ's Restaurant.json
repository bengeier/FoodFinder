{"text":"The quintessential diner in Whitby for the home cooking experience. We've eaten here as a couple and a family, the quality was consistent with food and service. To us diners should have good coffee, eggs, bacon and someone that calls you honey. 5 stars for authenticity, portions and service."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for an affordable delicious breakfast. Had no idea it was here until I checked Yelp! Very friendly staff and great tasting food!"}
{"text":"Good home cooking! It's a small place, but the portions are HUGE! I was genuinely surprised when my western omelette arrived; it was half the plate! I gave it everything I could, but I could not finish it. The potatoes were lightly fried, but not greasy and there was a ton of those as well. I could barely touch the toast that came with it all.   The prices are absolutely worth it. The selection isn't huge, but they make everything on it well."}
{"text":"\"PJs has a tiny storefront on a strip plaza - took us a few minutes to find it as their sign says \"Restaurant\" in large bold letters followed by \"All Day Breakfast\". PJ's is a small, cursive afterthought placed on top. \" \"The exterior made us feel as if we never left our budget hotel room - beige and brown tones, some muted green, laminate all over, clean and generic. \" \"The omelettes were large and hearty with a little piece of orange garnishing their tops and a generous side of home-made potatoes.\" A few bites of our full experience.."}
{"text":"Had great diner-style food here.  The toasted westerns are the best! Great little casual place, such places sadly disappearing."}
{"text":"Not too extravagant and what you would expect. Hot beef sandwich seemed to do the job but was a little past is prime. Breakfast is a sure shot. Club sandwich looked good."}
{"text":"Your classic, solid, standard diner type place. Good breakfast spot, neither awe-inspiring nor disappointing."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick, inexpensive breakfast in Whitby, PJs is a town standard. Located in a tiny strip mall between an MMA dojo and RBC Royal Bank, PJs has everything you need for a basic breakfast, including friendly waitresses, quick service, hot and decent food, and bar stools if the 15 or so booths are full. Lots of seniors in the morning, usually a sign of value."}
