{"text":"Just had the pork belly sandwich which is one of the best I've had. The last time I came here, I was pleasantly surprised how good the pork belly bao was.  Normally I'm not a big fan of baos but theirs was really good.  I also had the chicken pho which is great.  Tastes very natural with no msg. Will definitely come back regularly since I live close by and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean. The staff is super nice. I ordered take out and it was quite quick. Rare beef pho was lovely. Being so close to home, I wouldn't go anywhere else for pho anymore. Ordered the combo with veggie rice roll and grilled beef roll, both were very nice. The grilled beef was very yummy! Love that their options are simple and I don't have to look through a hundred weird options like other pho places. They have main food options in each of the menu sections (pho, sandwich, roll) of the beef, chicken, shrimp, tofu or another one or two."}
{"text":"Delicious. I tried this place spontaneously and I feel like I've won the lottery. Had the lemongrass tofu bao and the tofu and kimchi roll as well as the avocado roll. Everything was to die for. The service was impeccable. Respectful and attentive staff. The woman at the cash noticed that I got all veggie options and let me know that they had a veggie ph√≤. The restaurant was very clean, no garbage or dirty tables. Furthermore, the washrooms were spotless. I was so impressed, I got take-out for the family to try."}
{"text":"After having a bad experience at a Vietnamese restaurant 10 years ago, I hadn't gone to a Vietnamese place since then. So I was quite hesitant to go to this one, but I'm glad I did.  This was right after a yoga class, and my primary criteria for a restaurant after that is speed of service. Not quality of food, not decor or price, but speed. I'm hungry, and I want to eat now.  This place did not disappoint.  The food came in less than 10 minutes from when I ordered. As someone who appreciates rapid service, this was a major bonus.  The food itself was quite good, and certainly redeemed Vietnamese cuisine for me.  And of course, I had to check the washroom for cleanliness to report back to my Yelp readers. And yes, it was clean.  Overall, a pretty good little restaurant."}
{"text":"Gave vroll a try since wifey wanted pho takeout. Interior looked clean upon arrival. We ordered the vroll bun and customizable pho. I find it odd that a pho place does not offer special beef noodle nor does it give size options for the noodle. For one size the pho was 9.50 definitely on the expensive end.  The vroll bun was okay priced at 11.50 given that it had meat ball, a couple types of meat and spring roll.t he surprise came when we opened the takeout boxes at home. The portion was shockingly small for the pho. And the quality of the meat was subpar; quite rough and tough. Soup base a bit bland. My wife who's not a big eater by any means was hungry after the pho. Flavour wise the seasoning of the meat for the bun was ok. Portion wise again on low end and I was hungry after it. As well. Spring roll lacked necessary crunch as it was too thick and the filling although had taro lacked spice. A 0lus for using recyclable paper based containers. I really hoped this place would be good since it's close to home but overall wouldn't recommend unless you are on a diet."}
{"text":"The restaurant look nice and clean however because of the nature of the role ( fresh role ) human hand touch and the role was pre role ( I guessed) bacteria grow fast therefore my girl friend having a diarrhea very bad ... sorry never come back"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and it wasn't anything special. If you're really (and I mean really) craving bao then this can help you? Had two pork belly bao's and one beef vermacelli and both seemed mediocre with regards to flavour and quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"It's a no fuss restaurant with a seating area but no servers. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. Food is served in disposable containers. I had the well done beef pho at it was tasty. I also had their pork belly bao which was good except the bao bun could be thinner and lighter. I also ordered the fresh rolls which i liked too but still prefer the bao. They had a promo of free bubble tea which is great but i prefer the ones that are not made with powder. I asked about their bahn mi buns but they said they dont make sandwiches with them anymore...i wonder why. Overall, the dishes were tasty and good for a quick, 'get it over with' meal."}
{"text":"Tried the Pad Thai and it was pretty good. I also go there just to get bubble tea all the time! Not the best out there, but pretty good. Nice staff. If you're in the area check it out!"}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese soup place! Reasonable price with genuine taste of Vietnam in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"ALERT- New Ownership. Once again Chinese ownership went and bought a different type of Asian establishment and put their soya sauce/MSG stamp on it. It's a shame because before the Reno I used to pick up 2-3 times per week. As soon as I saw General Tso's Chicken and Young Chow fried rice on the menu I knew my Vietnamese fix would be compromised. I just finished eating my grilled beef vermicelli which was doused in soya sauce and now the toxic MSG in their crap food is kicking in. By the way seeing the rude, cranky woman at the front should have tipped me off not to spend my $9 on the garbage I just threw out. I'll never return. Guess what people? When I walk into a Vietnamese restaurant guess what kind of food I'd like to eat? Vietfrikinnamese. You've been warned.  I'll never go near this fraud of a restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place has a delicious variety of Vietnamese food from Bahn to bao to pho and combos of all I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time here, only try pho and rolls today, fresh and good. Will try others next time."}
{"text":"The food here is really fresh and healthy! Loved the rolls!! Simply delicious!! Had the pulled pork Bao (which is this steamed bun) WOW!!! Very Friendly Service and took time ro explain everything! Will be coming back..."}
{"text":"Overall I wouldn't recommend this place sadly.  It has a bunch of baos similar to banh mi boys or it's a bao time, so it isn't very original. The baos also were not that spectacular.  Ordered pho as well, and eat everything in store.   They served the pho and every thing in disposable plastic containers. I definitely do not recommend the pho. It's like pho you order in a food court. Pretty flavorless and tasted like the instant pho broth you can make at home. Seriously lacking star anise flavor. Skimpy ingredients as well  The girl behind the counter was pleasant enough. Clean enough place, but would not come again"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was. Did not expect much from this takeout joint but it was great for what it is. This is not Vietnamese food at its finest but it was great value and food was outstanding. Curry noodles was awesome, the fresh rolls were fresh and bursting with flavour. Great addition to the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"Place changed drastically since the new owners opened up. Food qualities not quite there anymore."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast casual, Vietnamese cuisine to eat, this is the beat place to come to in Vaughan.   The owners and staff of Vrolls are extremely friendly and they welcome you within their doors with open arms.    It's a relatively small place to eat but it is very comfortable. The Vermicelli dish tasted fresh (especially the chicken) and it was a delight to eat compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area. A plus is that I believe it's a part of UberEATS, which is also a plus if you'd rather have your food delivered.   I can't help but keep saying the staff are amazing and very friendly so if you pass by, don't hesitate to walk in?"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try after their \"grand re-opening\" and I was very impressed! The meat to noodles ratio was unreal, for the first time ever I finished my noodles before my beef. The pho tastes very authentic and their specialty spring rolls were great. They also serve these interesting deep fried dumplings with cream cheese inside, quite tasty as well. The service was quick and attentive so I will definitely be back!"}
