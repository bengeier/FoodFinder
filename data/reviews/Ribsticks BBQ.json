{"text":"Great place with unique interior decor (the owner did almost everything himself!) and friendly staff. And of course, the food is DELICIOUS.  For those who like spicy food, ask for their hot BBQ sauce - it's awesome."}
{"text":"Nice concept but the food was just okay. The owner was nice and friendly. We got the 2 meat combos with the burnt ends and pulled pork. Seasoned just okay. Lightly sauced. Sauce is very spicy. No dessert. They were out. Not my kind of BBQ. Pricey for what we got. $28.00 for 2 people for the entr√©es. Won't return."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable barbecue! The wings were awesome and crispy, ribs fell off the bone, brisket melted in your mouth. Coleslaw is great. Inexpensive beers. Definitely going back to try more things. Super nice people here as well!"}
{"text":"Pricey for the amount of food. It was not what We expected. It's a fast food quality bbq joint. The kale salad was great, but the entrees ranged from ok to ugh. We ordered the meat duo with rib tips and ribs. Not much bbq sauce and the to go container was only 1/2 full. Kids didn't like the mac n cheese or the pulled pork.  Hungry and Disappointed."}
{"text":"I looked on Yelp for beef brisket recommendations. This place came up so we went. I was pleasantly surprised by this little joint. Brisket was tender and tasty and they let me put on my own sauce on, as requested . Baked beans had just the right kick. Mac and cheese was good, but a little cool in temperature. Will be back..."}
{"text":"This is not true barbecue.  Most of the meats are pre-done sous vide then put on a grill before serving.  The texture of the food is not the same as a long, slow smoke.  None of the sides are memorable, and at best servicable.  Cleveland is no BBQ town, and Ribsticks preserves that tradition."}
{"text":"They were out of brisket on a Saturday night and the ribs were tasty but tough.  The sides were nothing special.  Mac n Cheese was bland and not worth eating.  The baked beans were ok and tasted exactly like from a can."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ. Had the Trio Platter with pork ribs, pulled park and brisket. Baked Beans were also very good. Nice addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I got take out from them. I have been dying to try the food. The pulled pork was ok.  Nothing super spectacular but the BBQ sauce that came with it was way too sweet and over done with celery salt and totally encasing the pork so there was no way around it.  To the point where I couldn't even eat it.   The mac n cheese was below par.  The daily side of potato salad wasn't too bad.   I think they are overpriced for such a teeny menu.  If you wanted anything green for a side you can forget it....they have no green anything.. Overall, not a great experience and I won't go back.  Too bad too.  I was hoping they'd be good!"}
{"text":"Man this dude knows a good meat. Expert BBQ and really really good sides. Brisket is my favorite, with the rib tips a close second. Bourbon peaches are the sweet to beat the meat, and I really like the bite of their Cole slaw. Criminally empty every time I'm in there, which is frequent. Also really enjoy the local beers. I hope they continue to do great, I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ and delicious sides! I had the \"burnt ends\" sandwich which is the crispy bits at the end of the roast with BBQ sauce and onions. The mac and cheese is great! Definitely check them out."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch. Ordered rip tips and a pulled pork sandwich. Also had a side of mac & cheese, coleslaw, and baked beans.  The pulled pork sandwich and the mac & cheese were both very good. They were also one dollar off because of lunch.  The rib tips were a bit surprising. It was just chopped up red meat with a barbecue sauce drizzled across it. The smoke flavor came out of the meat a bit, and it tasted pretty good. There was also a ton of it on the plate.  However, the meet was a bit on the tough side, and it also wasn't very warm.  The baked beans were OK, but nothing to write home about. The coleslaw had very little flavor to it, and it was a very small portion.  Probably just as well, since it wasn't that good.   The service was a bit slow, which was surprising since there were only two tables of customers in the restaurant. In addition, you did not have a choice of barbecue sauces or any condiments for that matter, including salt and pepper. The iced tea cup runneth dry, and the refill was a long time coming.   If this were the only barbecue place in town, it would have been pretty good. However, there are a lot better places to go."}
{"text":"Worked up an appetite after a day of yard work and headed over to be refueled.  Had read about this joint in the local paper a couple months ago and was glad to finally have a chance to stop by.  The BBQ is very very light on smoke which isn't to my taste generally.  But it lets the meat really shine and the sauce is really nice.   Tried ribs and brisket - would give the ribs a nod - the brisket was just a bit too bland for me.  The coleslaw had a hint of lime which was super interesting and delicious! The banana pudding was a big disappointment - artificial flavor didn't seem to match the homemade tastes of everything else."}
{"text":"The food was good and priced well.  My brisket was tasty but totally cold.   I thought it was a pretty small portion.  The sides are also pretty small.  You won't leave hungry but you won't leave stuffed either.  Cole slaw and baked beans were good but not giving them rave reviews.  Barley salad was dry.    We also tried the rib tip sandwich.   Also good but you don't need to come out of your way to try this place."}
{"text":"Just went to Mission BBQ the night before, and was still cravin' some slow cooked goodness. Ribsticks is in a strip mall next to Whole Foods, easy to miss but glad we stopped in!  Tried the sampler of spare rib, pulled pork and brisket. All had a healthy serving of homemade brown BBQ sauce. The sauce is delicious by itself and really enhances the spare rib and brisket. I would have preferred a Carolina vinegar dressing for the pulled pork, but it was still good. The quality of the preparation, flavor was excellent.   Another added bonus -- the iced tea was ah-maz-ing! Tastes like it was sun brewed. The desserts, though I did not try, also looked great. Will try next time I come by.  Here's the weird part -- the shop is run by a super friendly Korean couple. The husband is professionally trained and was a professor in hotel management. It sounds like he put a lot of thought into the concept, decor, and, most of all, the food -- all of it works! Not so surprising that Koreans are good at BBQ, huh? (Not racist btw) Try them out... We need more places like this on the eastside!"}
{"text":"A good addition to the Cedar Rd dining scene. Locally owned, not a chain-good food and friendly service. I've had the beef brisket and the pulled pork sandwiches. They're both delicious but the brisket is my fave. Homemade bread, homemade pickles and homemade coleslaw make for a perfect sandwich. Had the bourbon spiced peaches both times because, well, bourbon spiced peaches"}
{"text":"I love this place!! It's a great local spot. I got the Cleveland pulled pork with baked beans and sweet tea. It was amazing!! The bbq sauce is to die for. Plus the owner was so nice and you could tell he cares about what he serves."}
{"text":"I'm really baffled by all the 5 star reviews.  I tried the ribs, pulled pork and chicken wings, and a wide variety of the sides.  The ribs were tender but had a mostly gummy texture with just a little bit of crunchy texture where the grilling at the end had added it.  They do a sous vide treatment to the meat first, then smoking and a final grilling step.  I think their process still needs work.  I like a classic tender/chewy quality to my ribs.  While sous vide might work in other applications, bbq ribs might not be one--maybe more time in the smoker might help.  The pulled pork also felt off texture-wise to me and had some off flavors that didn't go with what I hope for from pulled pork.  I should say that both pork meats came with the house bbq sauce which was kind of unusual.  Not really identifiable as Carolina, Memphis, or St. Louis, etc ...it is its own thing but didn't really appeal to me at all.  The chicken wings were kind of ok, a little dry, but the skin was crunchy.  The flavor to me was not that great.  I had no urge to chow through a whole pile of them.  The sides were unmemorable.  My two star rating feels a little generous to me.  I guess since they are new I'd like to give them little bit of room to improve things but I doubt that I will ever be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork spare ribs with mac and cheese and bread pudding. Everything was excellent! The ribs fell off the bone and I found myself scraping my plate to get more of that sauce (I'm definitely ordering extra sauce next time)! The bread pudding was a little dense but the flavor was so good, I didn't even care! GREAT ADDITION TO UNIVERSITY HEIGHTS!"}
{"text":"First off, this review is based on just one visit for a take out order so keep that in mind.  We ordered the beef brisket meal with two sides.  I had mac and cheese and coleslaw and my husband had baked beans and coleslaw.  The food was ready when they said it would be and tasted very good but we both thought that, based on how small the portions were, it was too expensive at about $26.00 for the order.  We will probably try another visit and try to eat in next time."}
{"text":"Great place just had lunch there today! Pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese were excellent!"}
{"text":"I love this place! So excited to have this place so close to home. The prices are reasonable the portions are perfect. Best bread pudding I've ever had. The meat and sauce were delicious! Mac and cheese was so unique with a tangy bite. Can't wait to try the Korean beef sandwich next."}
{"text":"Really good bbq don't know why is isn't crowded. People you should come here. Its really good . I would hate to see it place not here ."}
{"text":"Small place, great intimate vibe. Everyone that works here is super friendly and offers great recommendations.   The food was excellent. I ordered the Trio w/ spare rib, pulled pork and brisket. The slice of brisket I received was slightly less \"well-done\" than I like my brisket to be. I mentioned this to the gentleman that took my order and he sliced up another piece immediately. It was amazing!   As I was about to leave (very satisfied), the staff had prepared a slice of chocolate cake in a to go container as an apology for the brisket. This was unexpected and completely unnecessary, 5 stars on the food and service. I will definitely be back, the next time I'm in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Ordered the ribs with sides of coleslaw and mac and cheese. The ribs were great! I was impressed with the decor and that fact they had draft beers was a plus. Glad a great business setup shop in UH."}
{"text":"Food is average, but this is not bbq. Lacking smoke flavoring. Brisket had a nice smoke ring but the wood they are using cant be hickory which is king of all woods when smoking brisket or pork. Meat was moist and tender but needs some work. Sauce was decent"}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall location deceive you. They were pretty empty when I stopped by, but I really hope they make it, because this was unique but solid barbecue!  According to the internet, their meat goes through a sous vide step prior to smoking, which means it's not as smoky as you might be used to, but the texture is great. I had the pulled pork sandwich and my husband had the brisket one-- both of us really enjoyed it.  The caramelized onions are a nice touch. I might ask for the coleslaw on the side next time, though.  Their barbecue sauce wasn't a standout, but it's tasty, and not overly sweet.  My side of mac n' cheese was really good. My husband liked the baked beans and said the bourbon peaches were great.  Prices are pretty reasonable, orders are ready super fast, food is good, and employees are friendly. If you're craving barbecue on the east side, Ribsticks is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Ribsticks is amazing.  The place has a chipotle fast casual vibe. I was nervous it was a national chain I hadn't heard of.  The prices are pretty good. $16 for 3 meats and 2 sides. I'm a pretty big eater and was full.  We ordered every meat. The ribs were the fall off the bone style. Absolutely amazing. Pulled pork was great, brisket was great, and kielbasa was kielbasa.  I'd never heard of rib tips. They were alright.  The sides were each fantastic. Good mac and cheese, fantastic thick baked beans, and great banana pudding."}
{"text":"SO GOODDDDD! I love the food here! It defintley fills you up! The people are a little quiet but they are very polite! Love the food!"}
{"text":"We got a variety of meat, sides and sandwiches and nothing was notable. The sauce had way too much pepper which just overwhelmed any other flavors. The brisket had an odd texture, the ribs were mediocre and the pulled pork was a little dry. The macaroni and cheese was bland with plain old dry bread crumbs from a can sprinkled on top. The special cole slaw was regular old slaw with a little bit of orange juice or zest in it. I can't recommend it and we won't go back."}
{"text":"Read other reviews how great they were here's my opinion and I'm a cook so here it is tender but not a smoky taste on the ribs and brisket sauce average tasted like oven meat baked beans nothing special here Mac and cheese bland bland bland. Side of the day red beans and rice no rice in sight."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good bbq! I had the three meat platter which had just the right amount of deliciousness. The pulled pork and brisket were very good. Tender, good flavor and not too fatty. I was a little disappointed at the burnt ends. I guess coming from the south I am used to something different but these burnt ends tasted almost like chopped turkey. The sauce was really good...I put that stuff everywhere!! (I didn't try the spicy)....and make sure to get the bourbon peaches, amazing!"}
{"text":"Good place for Q in a city not known for Q.  Like others the food wasn't hot.  Just warmed up.  Pulled pork was flavorful and there was plenty of it.  The brisket was delicious. But again it was Luke warm.  Baked beans were good.  Cole slaw was as expected.  Excellent staff.  Nice people.  Super friendly."}
{"text":"Outstanding in every aspect. We had the trio with ribs, brisket, and burnt ends. All were genuine, tender, and tasty. Great rub , nice bark, and more tender then I usually care for. But everything was spectacular, and by blending the spicy and regular barbecue sauces,  it was a homerun. Mac and cheese and heirloom coleslaw were really nice sides. Overall value was very good as well. I truly hope they are successful and stick around. I'll be back again and again"}
{"text":"Love the rustic-industrial decor.  Staff was extremely friendly & attentive.  Food was amazing.  I've been there twice and have sampled all of the sides.  The mac & cheese is the comfort food you want it to be.  The quinoa is light and refreshing.  I'd never had grits before but omg, they were amazing.  And the pulled pork---fall apart tender.  If you haven't been there yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall. Manager is pleasant. Owners were working hard in the open kitchen during a light lunch rush. Decor is modern with several tables if you want to dine in. Pick Two $14 comes with 2 sides. Pick Three $16 comes with 2 sides. Each additional side is $2 and they come in 4oz? containers. They also have sandwich combos with one side or 1/2lbs of meat and 2 sides. I would say the portions sizes and prices are reasonable and roughly in-line with places like Mission BBQ, Proper Pig, and Woodstock.   Pulled Pork - Excellent. Moist, tender and I enjoyed the BBQ sauce with it. Good even when reheated the next day!   Beef Brisket - Moist and tender. Served in two long slices. Would have been great if it was not 2/3 fat. I mean, fat adds flavor, but this was just way too much. Just need to trim up their slices and it would be perfect.   Ribs - Tender, pulled off the bone easily, but not my favorite.   Kielbasa - Seemed okay, I don't care for kielbasa in general so no opinion on this.   Burnt Ends - I was expecting burnt ends like how Oak and Embers serves them, these leaned more towards little chunks of jerky. Not bad, but I would not get them again.   Coleslaw - Nice crunch. Has a taste of citrus to it. Really enjoyed this, and was disappointed that they only filled the container up half way.   Bread Pudding - Really enjoyed this even without the raisins. Very tasty!  Mac & Cheese - Great idea, not executed well enough though. It's saucy and has a crushed cracker topping but the cheese they use is bright orange and if I had to guess it's the kind you find in a bag at the convenience store that you pump into a tray for pretzels or nachos.   Cheesy Grits - Okay, but unfortunately they used that fake cheese sauce again.   Baked Beans - Not bad, but nothing special about these.   BBQ Sauce - Regular or Spicy. Nothing too crazy so don't expect potent smokey, sweet, vinegar, whatever notes. It's pretty simple but works well!   Cookie $1 - Normal sized and actually a really good chocolate chip cookie but super dry burnt ends that are baked into it did not work. Would not buy again unless they take out the burnt ends.   I was torn between a 3 and 4 star rating for Ribsticks. The texture of their pulled pork and brisket is perfect, but there is not a lot of flavor to it so don't expect to see much of a rub or smoke ring on the meats. Just add some of their BBQ sauce though and you'll be fine. I was happy to see that they did not over price their sides and I really enjoyed the coleslaw and bread pudding a lot. If they could make their cheese sauce from scratch I think that would make their mac & cheese phenomenal. Kick up their baked beans a notch with some more flavor and they would be really great too. I was told they were working on making corn bread which is something I always love to see at BBQ places.   Overall I think they have a pretty good start to things in the BBQ world. They are new so they do have some tweaking to do if they really want to rank high amongst their competitors, but I would definitely give them another try!"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem found on the south side of Cedar Center. I had the brisket sandwich, the meat is so tender and juicy and the home made pickles were the perfect added crunch on top of the soft home made bun. Mac and cheese side was also good. Husband had Duo of brisket and rib tips which he enjoyed very much. We will go back soon and try to leave room for the very yummy looking home made cakes!"}
{"text":"Beef short ribs are to die for! Tender and juicy with full flavor. The service was quick with a smile. Great new business for Cleveland, can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! The wait was so worth it!!! I am originally from the south (and have tasted BBQ all over the country), but this is some of the best I have ever had. I was fortunate enough to meet the culinary genius behind this compilation of techniques that produces a BBQ unlike any other. You can taste the passion he has for his food in every bite! The chicken wings have a nice crisp skin yet the meat is so moist and flavorful. The spices and smoke really compliment one another perfectly. The pulled pork was in nice big pieces and just as moist and flavorful as the chicken. I would say they tied as my favorite of the things I have tried. The brisket was my least favorite so far (only because their has to be a least favorite of the things I tried, lol) just because we both found it a tad on the drier side though the flavor was still great. The ribs have a little bit of heat to them but it isn't extreme and balances nicely with the light sweetness of the sauce. They were not quite as tender as I had hoped but were very tasty even so. The coleslaw is made in house from scratch as well and is THE BEST coleslaw I have ever had, anywhere! It is not overly sweet and the light sauce allows the taste of the fresh crisp veggies to shine through. I could definitely eat a bowl of just coleslaw and be happy (and that comes from a meat eater at heart!). The homemade pickled veggies were a touch sweet and nice and crunchy. The quinoa salad with beans is so light and fresh tasting! It was a surprising but perfect compliment to the BBQ. I have to say that I really can't wait to go back and try some more. The thing that truly topped off the experience was the people, the owner and staff. The customer service part of the business is definitely on point! I also have a gluten allergy and they were very helpful with regards to that as well. The restaurant itself is nice and bright and has such great style in a fast casual atmosphere. It is appropriate for families with kids as well. I highly recommend Ribsticks and would go so far as to say that it will be what truly defines the new Cleveland BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"Place is small but nice.  Straight forward concept. Order at the register, and they grab a seat and wait till they finish off your carnivorous desires. They also have bbq tofu strips. That was a joke.  This was some very different BBQ. I started with the 3 meat combo, hold the sauce and Cole slaw.  Why did I hold the sauce, welll because good bbq does not need sauce or just a little.  To be contunued"}
{"text":"Okay, let's talk BBQ!!!  This is a small restaurant, located in a strip mall. You could miss it, if you weren't looking for it. Very clean place. The decor was casual and calm. Nothing flashy and loud, which is a plus. The guy that greeted us was pretty awesome. Super polite and on point. We told him we wanted the meat trio and to give us 3 of their best meats. He didn't disappoint.  We got pork spare ribs Beef brisket and the pulled pork Our sides were the cheese grits and the Cole slaw. The meat was so tender, you didn't need a knife and it literally fell off of the bone. The BBQ sauce was a mixture between sweet and tangy. It was very good. Let's focus on the slaw for a second. A lot of places over due Cole slaw and try to fancy it up by adding unnecessary ingredients.  This place? Truly does old fashion Cole slaw. Like, regular old fashion normal cole slaw. It was awesome, we ordered a second round.  The cheese grits were fantastic. You can actually taste that they were made with stock instead of water, which is a definite bonus. My hubby was still hungry so he ordered a Rib tip Sandwich.  It was very tasty, the liked the burnt pieces and the pickled veggies gave it a wonderful taste. The staff and atmosphere were great! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was about a 3 but I'm giving them a 4 because of the fantastic attitude of everyone there and the phenomenal German chocolate cake we brought home for dessert. Cake was baked on the premises and was a 5. I would order a whole one for an occasion. I got the ribs which were ok- a bit of a weird texture as noted in other reviews. Grits were great, I wasn't that impressed with the bourbon peaches. Husband got the brisket which was average as was the mashed potatoes but we thought the Mac and cheese was really good. Prices were a bit high for the portion sizes but overall I would come back."}
{"text":"Just went back for dinner (before was lunch).  Dinner was even better than lunch, and lunch was GREAT!  This time, had the 2-meat sampler.  Chose pork ribs and kielbasa -- YUM on both!  Savory and tender!  Chose as sides cheesy grits (ultimate comfort food!) and Yelpers' best friend, bourbon peaches.  At first, I thought, what's the big deal on the peaches.  Then I noticed I didn't share them w/the BF -- and I am usually very generous!  We've already decided we're going back next week.  Check it out!  It's a new place that deserves the business!"}
{"text":"Everything was great.  I had the Duo sampler. The brisket was amazing!!! I had the baked beans and cheese grits. I love that they have a kids meals. Both of my children had ribs and the mac and cheese. My husband had the pulled pork nachos. He said he will always get them when he comes. Nice local beer selection.  We will be back for sure. Nice trendy gem in the Heights."}
{"text":"We ordered carryout. The food was rather cool instead of warm when we got home so I'd warm it in the oven next time. We ordered pulled pork sandwiches which were pretty good. The coleslaw side was better."}
{"text":"Ordered the meat duo, the beef brisket and pork ribs were tender and flavorful. Sides were good. Will visit again."}
{"text":"The sauce is really good~ Price is fair for the portion. The cook and the server are very nice and polite. I went there an hour before close, so they were running out of some food, but they gave me extra side dishes for free. That's really nice of them. Highly recommend the beef tips."}
{"text":"The ribs were amazing.  But the service was just as good if not better.  The portions aren't huge but enough.  Can't express enough the amazing service."}
{"text":"We placed a large order to go and everything was outstanding. I had the pulled pork and it was tender and moist. The mac and cheese was crunchy and cheesy. The bourbon peaches were incredible and I could have eaten a pound of them. Everyone was very happy with their meals. Those with the coleslaw said it was exceptional and those that had the ribs were also very pleased. The finale was one of their fresh cookies and I may have to stop by to pick up a dozen or more of those. Make sure you don't leave without one!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Looking forward to coming back. Friendly service.  Good price. Bottled beers available."}
{"text":"Great to see a BBQ joint with some good brisket (pull apart with a fork) vs. shoe leather that some try to pass as brisket.  The ribs were wonderful.  They pulled off the bone as one would hope.  I spoke to the owner and he shared that he tries to limit the use of salt which was refreshing.   I ate around 11:30 and still not ready for dinner. Portions are great with reasonable prices as an added bonus.  Ribsticks' prices were very fair for not only BBQ, but a fast food restaurant (Ribsticks is not fast food.)."}
{"text":"First off, let me just say that Ribsticks exhibited incredible professionalism the first time I went a month ago. The grill wasn't working, but I had gone hoping to try their food. The restaurant staff gave me a complimentary free sample of ribs, a roll, and a cookie (the ribs were reheated instead of grilled from scratch). The food was already pretty good, but for them to give it to me for free due to tech issues is quality service, and something that I rarely see.  The food is fairly standard as far as barbecues go. I got the 3 meats and 2 sides deal, and shared it with a friend. We got the rib tips, beef brisket, and barbecue pork. The beef brisket was very good, the pork was solid but nothing spectacular. As is standard for me with southern food, I got some iced tea which was just standard iced tea. The sides I got were potato salad and peaches - the peaches were surprisingly very good.  As far as flavor goes, if you live in this area, it's a good place to try good southern barbecue food, but it's not the type of place I'd drive from out of town just to get. Service is excellent though."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the 1st time with my husband last weekend and the food was delicious! The manager Louis was really awesome and helped us make some really yummy decisions! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the meat trio and got the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. Our sides were mac & cheese and bourbon peaches. The ribs tasted fine and they weren't fatty, which I enjoyed. However, the brisket and pulled pork were dry. I think the mac & cheese could have been cheesier, and the peaches tasted like canned peaches with a touch of cinnamon.   Although the food came quickly, I wish the meats were juicer. The staff were very nice and served us a strawberry applesauce-like drink on the house, which was very good with actual strawberries. I wouldn't mind coming here if I were starving because of the quick service and friendly staff, but I would go elsewhere for more quality food."}
{"text":"The meats are good. We got our order to go and forgot to get extra sauce, otherwise I think we would have liked them more but the meats were good as is just more dry without the extra sauce. But the sides are really really good! We got 4 of them, baked beans, cheesy grits, potato salad and Mac-n-cheese. Yum! And the service was good too."}
{"text":"This was such an awesome place! I ordered the brisket, and I would order it every time. My friends got sandwiches and loved that as well. The mac and cheese alone is a good enough reason to eat here. All the sides we got were amazing, peaches, baked beans and coleslaw.   It was also taco Tuesday and I ordered one taco but they came out with a tray of 5-6 tacos for the whole table to try one (no charge.)   The staff is so helpful and kind to everyone. They go above and beyond for their customers."}
{"text":"I was really hoping this place would be good, and based on the reviews on here, I thought I would be in for a treat, but sadly all I was in for was a big disappointment.  Don't fall for all the 5 star reviews like I did, as most are by people from Cleveland (which has traditionally been a BBQ wasteland), who have no idea what real BBQ should taste like.  I tried the \"burnt end\" sandwich, which is basically a lie.  It doesn't have real burnt ends, but instead is just cut off pieces of the the crust of a brisket (not the actual burnt point of the brisket, which should then be further cooked after being cut off to give them a crispy char).  The meat is not even smoked, as far as I could tell!    Portions are tiny - my sandwich had about as much meat as a $1 hotdog at Progressive field and came with a sauce cup side of watery mac & cheese that makes Kraft mac & cheese seem like a creamy delicacy (\"all\" this for $7.50!).  I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but if what I ate is any indication, this is a sad excuse for real BBQ...don't waste your time and $ like I did.  If you want something decent, you're either going to have to travel to the west side (Proper Pig) or splurge a bit on Mabel's...."}
{"text":"I had half slab of ribs with mac and cheese and beans. The ribs were nice smoked ribs with just enough sauce, mac and cheese was good and the baked beans were excellent, with just the right amount of spiciness. Wife pulled which she said was very good she also liked the bourbon peaches"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I have had in the Midwest. And the rib tips are to die for. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"We are here on business from Ca..I have been looking for a good BBQ in the Cleveland area . I think I have found one. We had the pulled pork and Korean beef sandwiches with a BBQ salsa and chips for an appetizer everything was spot on -We had baked beans and cheesy grits as our sides and they were delish -On the way out the owner gave us two cookies 1 was a candied pork chocolate chip cookie and the other has not been eaten yet -Overall a very pleasurable experience great food -thanks yelp- it will now be on the list for stops next time we visit the area."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  High quality food for reasonable price. Strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Found this great little BBQ joint while driving on Cedar road in University Heights. It's in a small strip mall and if you're not looking for it, you could miss it....but DON'T!  The decor is great, wood plank upcycled walls, faux brick and a clever chalkboard with the menu and funny picture opportunities! Ordered the brisket. Buns are made fresh inhouse daily. Brisket was flavorful and tender. My side was cheesy grits. Those were so good!!!!!!  Came with BBQ sauce, but I highly recommend the spicy sauce near the registers. Hubs had crispy ends, again very tasty. We each had beers on tap. Appreciate that they're GLBC beers!  Bill came under $30. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a solid BBQ joint. If I had only one minor criticism, the meats weren't really hot...just medium temp. Flavor of the meat was so good that I was willing to overlook the temp. Eat here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the restaurant. I walked in and was taken in by the look and feel of the place: very trendy and clean. It reminded me of a spot I frequented in NYC. The service was great. The manager and owner were both present and very hospitable.   They had a short menu which is great for me because I can get overwhelmed with pages of choices!  I chose the Beef Brisket and a side of Cheesy Grits.   This was good eating. The grits were in point. The brisket was good, too. I liked the sauce and the coke slaw topping.   I'll spread the word. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. The restaurant has a modern, casual feel. Came with a friend, I had the 2 meat for $14, Beef Brisket and Pork Spare Ribs with two sides, I got mac and cheese and cole slaw. The beef brisket and spare ribs were both very tasty and tender, cooked very well. The cole slaw was creamy but light and flavorful, mac and cheese was delicious, had a crispy topping with cheezits I think? I also had the sweet tea, which was light and refreshing. The food came out pretty quickly and service was great, very friendly server.  Great price for the quality of food"}
{"text":"This area was definitely in need of a BBQ joint. A very pleasant surprise to see a private establishment set up shop in an area full of chain restaurants.   The food was delicious. We tried the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork which were all tender and tasty. The sauce has a good balance of tang, sweetness, and spice. This restaurant has the vibe of a big city BBQ place with aesthetically pleasing decor; a refreshing addition to the Cleveland food scene!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times with different people and I love the food so I keep coming back! Great customer service. While it's a BBQ place, try the baked goods for dessert, the chef is a baker who also teaches professionally. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Want to talk about good BBQ? Go to a different place.... want to talk about amazing BBQ?? COME TO RIBSTICKS. My word, was this fantastic. The owner and manager are passionate about what they do, are always open to suggestions, and do they make some fantastic BBQ.   Starting with the sides, the 2 I had were amazing, along with the others looked good as well. The meat was tender, not too salty, and had great flavor. And the BBQ sauce --- omg that was even better.   I'm not one to rave about every place I go to, but I must say, this is one to try if you're in the area. Will be coming back VERY soon."}
{"text":"Found this place using Yelp and decided to check it out. Nice little place with good ambience!! Tried the 2 & 3 meat sampler which covered all meats available. The Brisket and Rib Tips are the Winners!! Tried 4 sides and the Bourbon Peaches are like eating Peach Cobbler without the crust!! I will be visiting quite often!!"}
{"text":"This area of Cedar was in dire need of a BBQ place. Ribsticks did not disappoint. It is not your typical southern BBQ joint, but the flavors of their meats were worth our time.  We always get the ribtips sandwich, pork ribs, and brisket. To cut off the meaty goodness, I always  include quinoa as one of our sides, lol.  Support local restaurants---especially that area of Cedar is mostly chains."}
{"text":"Call Ahead!!!  Disappointed to make the trek to this joint only to discover that it was temporarily closed.  Too bad, I was looking for some good BBQ and this place seemed to have some positive reviews.    Would have been nice if the temporary closing was posted somewhere besides on a cardboard sign on the door.  There was not a reopen date posted, so I'd recommend you spare yourself the trip or at least call ahead."}
{"text":"I ordered the burnt ends sandwich with the corn casserole (a daily special) on my first visit and the ribs with three sides at my most recent visit. The meat is chewy and flavorful. The burnt ends had a very small bone and a little bit of gristle, so keep an eye out. I enjoyed the ribs a lot. The sides are absolutely amazing. The mashed potatoes, bourbon peaches and corn casserole were all delicious. I bought more mashed potatoes and peaches to go with my leftover rib. The heirloom cole slaw was also refreshing. I was there with a group tonight, and everyone enjoyed their meals. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be back. Welcome to the neighborhood, Ribsticks!"}
{"text":"Tried this place a little closer to closing time than I would usually try a BBQ place, despite this - it was pretty darn good.  Brisket - tasty, little tough - but excellent Pork ends - great  Pulled pork - excellent Beans - good Mac/cheese - good Peaches - excellent  Definitely will try again earlier in the day."}
{"text":"The whiskey was a little dry but the ribs are delectable.  I am concerned the place will close so go there for reals. It is the best ribs in Cleveland for sure!!!"}
