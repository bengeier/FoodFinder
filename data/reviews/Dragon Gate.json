{"text":"UPDATE!  For about a year now, the food's been just about as awesome as it was when they were in their Brook Park Rd. location.  Szechuan dishes are pungent and addictive, egg rolls are awesome, and well...I only really get szechuan dishes, so I can't comment on the others.  BRING BACK THE MU SHU!!  They took it off the menu when they moved to Parma Hts. :("}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese Restaurants in the area.. the beef ho-fun (dried) will always be my Togo dish .! Wife likes the Singapore Meifun, which was also flavorful!  Been ordering here for as long as we've been in Parma Heights.. never had a bad experience!! Great food (trust me I'm Asian lol ) highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Heard many good things about this place so we decided to give it a try. Worst place we have ever eaten at. Service was horrible waited 10 minutes before we were even seated and they has maybe 10 ppl there. Our waitress was very rude brought our food out and it was cold. I just took a few bites and my kids also we brought almost 2 full boxes of food home. After we left all of us were complaining of stomach aches. Well needless to say we all ended up with food poisoning. Never again will I come to this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Favorite part is the Beef Teriyaki appetizer, won't find it anywhere else. Staff is all generally very friendly. Food is delivered in a good time manner, not to mention the restaurant itself is nicer than you're ideal go to Chinese food! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I have been a Dragon Gate customer for 20 years. My wife and I loved to visit when they were on Brookpark road. Since moving from Parma to Parma heights, the quality and taste of the food has dropped and the prices have increased. We tried it once more a week ago and it just did not bring back memories of the old place."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Ordered pressed duck for pick-up. Got home and it was meat loaf squares with brown gravy. Contrary to the menu description of braised long island duckling fried golden brown with crushed almonds and green onions topped with brown gravy. No almonds,no green onions and unless the meatloaf had duck in it  (which it did not taste like) no duck either. Another Cleveland one and done dining experience."}
{"text":"Been going to Dragon Gate for 7 years! This is the highest quality Chinese food I have ever eaten in my life! My favorite meal is Beef Lo Mein with fried rice, wonton soup and hot tea. Highly Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for good food! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time on 12/4. This place has been recommended to us once, and I also read reviews of it here on Yelp. EVERYTHING WAS OUTSTANDING. The brewed tea...the seaweed soup, the wonton soup, my husband's Wor Su Gai, and my General Tso's chicken. Like another reviewer said, the G.T. chicken IS NOT like everywhere else! Tender, large pieces of chicken in a sauce that's not icky-sweet! I ate from my dinner portion two more times! SOOO...so GOOD. We will be making this out PREFERRED place for Chinese."}
{"text":"Their Honey Gralic Chicken is amazing!!   We have been going to Dragon Gate for five years now and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Different location, same great food. Consistently good and the owners are always welcoming when we eat in with the kids. You get a ton of food for the price and we always have leftovers for later, which is even better!"}
{"text":"Its OK. The best part is that they have a drive thru. The fried wings are so-so"}
{"text":"The food was actually really good, but the fun began when we finished and the bill came.  They screwed it up badly (in our favor). My mom knew it was wrong so she added the difference to the tip.  After that the waitress returned and wanted to add $15 more to the bill.  My mom told them to void the transaction and do it over but they wouldn't listen.  My mom explained what she did and they continued to argue that the waitress keeps the tip.  Then My mom gave five extra dollars to them to shut them up and they still argued!  As we were leaving they told us they cancelled the transaction and they wanted to put it through AGAIN!  My mom refused.  I was going to offer to try and fix it with my credit card until one of the cashiers yelled \"Go to hell!\"  After that we just left.  Not our fault; not our problem.  This was my birthday dinner, so thanks so much Dragon Gate.  Sheesh.  If you go here make sure they give you the correct bill.  Their English is very broken until they want to cuss you out."}
{"text":"My mother told me about Dragon Gate years ago and I tried it when they were still on Brookpark. At the time I was so so on it but now I realize it was because I was used to the strip mall Chinese takeout that I had eaten for years. Which is mostly complete trash.  Now that I'm older and have had a chance to sample the dying breed of actual sit down old school Chinese restaurants, I can fully appreciate this place. The food is A-1. Over the course of two visits my wife and I have tried the Hong Kong Chicken which is delicious, the sweet and sour pork and chicken, and governor chicken. Everything has been amazing. The fried rice is fresh and some of the best I've had. The egg rolls are another star but the wonton soup is hands down the best I've sampled in CLE. Our little guy loves it!   The restaurant has been tastefully decorated to the point that you can't tell it was a Pizza Hut. It also has a drive through window...how convenient is that? On our two visits the service was always friendly and attentive. I'm genuinely happy because we have found a great quality Chinese restaurant that's not too far from home. I'll gladly make the drive in from Brunswick to eat here. Thank you Dragon Gate!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for 20 years.  Recently went for a take home order and when I got home I had the wrong kind of soup. Called back and the employee told me next time the right soup would be free.  Called back a week later and they said I could not have it because the employee did not right a credit ticket.  I can't help that they employee can't take an order right or right a credit ticket but I would think that a business could afford to give out a free bowl of soup rather than risk losing a customer, but I guess the need that $1.50 more than I.  If they can't hire and train employees correctly, they are going to lose a lot more customers and should.  They basically called me a liar-how's that for customer service.  Don't waste your money here-spend it where the employees can do their job and customer service comes first."}
{"text":"Amazing as has been for years. Hands down best Chinese around. Love the drive up window. Only thing that could make this place better is delivery. This is not you MALL Chinese. Egg rolls not like the crap stuff with just cabbage. This is how I remember Chinese as a child."}
{"text":"The Honey Garlic Chicken is top drawer! The staff is excellent and the cuisine is always consistently great!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a child (while at the original  location) they have the best Chinese food ever! They are a little expensive and recently changed their soup which I don't love as much. But overall great place to go!"}
{"text":"I am incredibly picky when it comes to Chinese restaurants, as they're often overpriced and overrated. Luckily, my husband grew up in Cleveland and knew of this awesome place with awesome people and I decided that I wanted to try it.   Holy mother of King Triton was the food delicious. The atmosphere is comfy and welcoming, and you are greeted happily when you walk through the door. Menus are placed in front of you and the servers are more than happy to give you suggestions if you're not sure what you're looking for! There's plenty of options for everyone who could possibly walk in.   Their wonton soup is to DIE for. Honestly, I could drink the broth from that soup all day long and never get sick of it. The noodles are soft but not mushy, and they have a meal size and a side size for those who can't drink too much broth!   Their broccoli was delicious and more than worth the entire experience there. And if you get the opportunity TRY THE SUMMER ROLL WRAPPED IN A RICE WRAP. My favorite roll from anywhere I've been!   Dragon Gate holds memories for my husband and now it holds memories for us too. A great little place to try if you're ever in town."}
{"text":"Visited the place based on the reviews wasn't as great as I expected! We had dinner here - ordered a \"complete dinner\" of empress chicken and governer chicken, both came with wonton soup and egg roll. We started off with the wonton soup and here's what we(my husband and I) felt - the wontons were a tad too thick and chewy! The egg rolls were awesome though - no complaints!! I had the empress chicken where the chicken was tough with a really thick breading. The governer chicken was decent but had a little more soy sauce than we'd expect. Both the entrees were sweet to our taste although they were on the menu under the schezwan specialities (which were listed as spicy). Overall the ambience was good but the food not so great!"}
{"text":"Great local Chinese restaurant. I've been going here (as well as their old location) for almost 20 years now. I have never order anything, and not been completely satisfied. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was good!  Honey and garlic chicken was bomb."}
{"text":"This is are go-to Chinese restaurant and we have been going to Dragon Gate for over 20 years.  The food is excellent and I would recommend to anyone and have.  The best egg rolls and won ton soup around.  We usually get Moo Goo Gai Pan and Hong Kong Chicken and this place does a great job with both.  The sweet and sour pork has green peppers, carrots and pineapple very old school."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, the Orange chicken was great and the mei fun was fantastic. They did make sure due to allergies.we had no shrimp it was nice to know to was safe to orderl."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a different Chinese place, and decided on Dragon Gate. It is several miles from where we live, but worth the trip. Won Ton soup is excellent, my wife liked the egg rolls (I don't eat them). I had the General Tso and my wife the Butterfly shrimp with bacon, she said it was a little sweet. The General Tso was good, different than the usual Chinese fair. The fried rice was standard. The unsweetened ice tea was not good. But I guess I shouldn't go into a Chinese restaurant and expect Lipton. It was a brewed Black tea. very strong, and had a floral taste to it. We plan on going back and trying some more things on their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Quick service and excellent food!  I am usually hesitant when I order General Tsao Chicken because most places give you poor pieces of grizzly chicken over breaded to hell.  But Dragon Gate is my go to spot for this dish from now on!  Check out the pic I uploaded of the lightly breaded and perfectly cooked chicken.  My food had all the appearance of a carefully/skillfully prepared dish as if I was hand picking my ingredients.  My wonton soup had several wonton noodles in it where most places only give you one or two.  Finally the taste was spot on.  Our server was very attentive despite being busy during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Good food. Egg rolls. Sweet and sour sauce is really good! Friendly wait staff house lo mien is a fav!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chinese spots on the west side.   The restaurant is clean, the employees are friendly, the service is fast, & last but not least...the food is good!  I'm a fan of the Honey Garlic Chicken. It's breaded chicken covered in a sweet honey garlic sauce. My only complaint is that it can be TOO sweet. I don't get it every time I'm here because of that. I love the vegetable fried rice & the egg rolls are decent (it varies visit by visit).  This restaurant has a drive thru so, you can pick up your to-go order!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Dragon Gate for my entire short life of 26 years. My mother and grandmother years before that.  They have the best Chinese food. Love the teriyaki sticks and hands down the BEST egg rolls and wonton soup. I've tried so many entrees that you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Dragon Gate is now re-opened!  They were forced to leave their former spot on Brookpark road in Parma, due to hospital construction.  The good news here is they picked a better location, and the building they purchased was totally redesigned with a modern Chinese theme. (formerly a Pizza Hut shop, however no sign of this from the inside whatsoever)  The food is not excellent....we are talking salty, fried food (like most Chinese places) however it's above average for same restaurants in its class.  Good menu selections.  My Mom and I arrived at about 6pm and had to wait approx 20 minutes before getting a booth for the both of us.  The establishment was extremely busy.  While we were waiting the smells thwarted my attempts at trying a healthier plate, although I did order a Vegetable chicken dish.    Did the dinner for 2....soup, egg roll, rice....  Soup was pretty light with essential flavorings....I hate when wonton lacks flavor and is either too oily/greasy or salty.  This was neither.  Egg roll....ok, not great, not bad but no complaints  My mom's plate was the Honey Garlic chicken.....WOW, great, like a pastry if that makes any sense....caramelized sweet batter with just a hint of garlic and chicken....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Chicken and Vegetables was ok.  Slightly heavier base than what I would have liked, but overall good taste....carrots, bamboo shoots, radish, and chicken.  Not bad.  That's all we had.  It was my first time at the location and I think they will do just fine.  A note...if your coming during peak hours, it's probably going to be busy.  Might have to wait awhile, but once you're in; you will probably be taken care of rapidly. (At least that was our case)  I might have liked the server to check on us a time or two more for drinks, but once again, overall I dig this place"}
{"text":"Yum! My husband and I have never found a Chinese restaurant that we both like. Well, we have now. The food was really good and so was the service"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Do not miss the homemade sweet red sauce that goes with the egg rolls - it's amazing and nothing like packaged duck sauce. As other reviews have mentioned, the flavor of each dish comes from actual real food - lemons for lemon sauce, etc.  I've been coming here since I was a child, and it ruined me for all \"Chinese restaurant in a box\" joints. You know the type: same red, black and white printed paper menu down to the number of each meal; same gray chunk reconstituted deep fried chicken clumps in every dish; same bright yellow fried rice.   Not here. The food is delicious and always made to order - they never bat an eye when I order a dish without mushrooms or such.   As background, this was my family's standard Chinese take out and Chinese lunch spot for over a decade back when it was on Brookpark Road. We were so sad when it closed - nothing to do with the restaurant, the entire plaza was sold to the government - but delighted when it reopened in Parma. Same consistent excellent quality!"}
{"text":"I will be coming to Cleveland after a good 40 year absence. I live in florida and have never found an even halfway decent Chinese restaurant. China lane has been closed for years, and I was disappointed to find Shanghai also closed. I hear this place is good, but where can I view a menu?"}
{"text":"To be honest, this is closer to a 3.5 star review.  I usually round up, but I reserve the quatro stars for my more impressed moments.  Girl's gotta draw the line somewhere.  PROS:  Actually tasty Americanized Chinese food--manages to avoid being absolute the starch/MSG-laden slop or steamed blandness that's unfortunately established itself as iconically Chinese American cuisine.  Very flavorful wonton soup.  (Not a huge fan of the uber-thick-skinned wontons but the broth was a winner.)  Has a drive-thru (how cool is that???!).  Rather nice furnishings--elegant latticework, Chinese paintings, on top of traditional Chinese music in the background.  Earnest, friendly service.  Reasonable prices.  Convenient and generously portioned group dining combos.  CONS: Tiny booths (definitely opt for a table for parties of 3 or more, unless elbow-sparring is part of your dinner plans).  Generous portions heaped on inadequately small dishes make serving awkward/difficult.  Not a huge deal for me but other clients were rather sad: no almond cookies, only fortune cookies (which, whimsically enough, contained unabashed endorsements for the Cleveland Art Museum rather than an actual fortune).    Also, I'm guessing this won't apply to most of the clientele here, but in the rare event that you would like to order something not listed on the menu or cooked in a more \"authentic\" way, options are limited.  Did however manage to order my chow mein somewhat crisped a la \"liang mian huang\" (score! nomnom).  Also, the staff is Cantonese, so Mandarin speakers, expect a high possibility of communication snafu or just stick to English.  CONS (THE SOMEWHAT TANGENTIAL RANT):   Call me a snob, but it's Americanized Chinese food.  And I admit, this is good as far as Americanized Chinese food goes, but it might as well be a whole different category of cuisine.  It's like comparing a Sonic burger to say, a gourmet burger at B-spot.  Or a gourmet burger you make at home with all the fixin's.  \"Authentic\" Chinese food is alive and kicking in Cleveland, you guys.  Yeah, yeah, some of those authentic restaurants and hole-in-the-wall delicious gems are in the ghetto, but so what?  Man up, dodge a few bullets and get some real Chinese food if you call yourself a Chinese food enthusiast.  Or if you're a wuss, go to Coventry.  (Just kidding, Coventry is pretty sweet.  But seriously.)  ---  Didn't have very high hopes when we came last night for dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  Tried ordering traditional dishes not listed on the menu--the staff looked legit enough okay, don't judge--and did come away with a halfway decent crisped noodle dish.  The bok choy-only side dish order fell through the cracks of my apparently tenuous line of communication with the Cantonese waitress.  (Note to self: English might be better than Mandarin for future interactions!)  We ordered a few couple extra dishes on top of the combo dinner for three--which amounted to an obscene amount of food that easily could've feed 4-5 people.    Notable highlights:   My favorite item was probably the very first item brought to the table: wonton soup and bowl of shrimp (rice) chips.  The wontons themselves weren't great but passable--the skins were thick, doughy and fluffy, almost dumpling-like, overwhelming and obscuring the taste of the tiny morsel of meat filling encased at their core.  But the broth--oh my.  Intensely flavorful, with a full sweetness whose origins I can't quite pin down, the broth was rich yet clear and included strips of char siew pork and what I originally thought was spinach but turned out to be chiffonaded bok choy.  Well done Dragon Gate, well done indeed.  The appetizers that came with combo included deliciously fatty, char siew ribs, fried and battered shrimp, eggrolls wrapped in deep-fried skins of chalupa-like thickness, (no sweet and sour sauce--that would've been a nice complement), tasty, jerky-like thin slices of beef on skewers, and best of all, the crowd pleasing addition of a flaming cup to roast your skewered beef--wholesome gimmicky fun I haven't had since Mandarin House back home in Ventura.    Everything else was flavorful and not overly seasoned.  My crisped chow mein was a little heavy on the gravy and toppings but decent.  I personally don't ever crave Chinese American food but for those who do, Dragon Gate's a solid choice and Parmanians and Clevelanders are lucky to have them as an option."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place when they were in old location and now i work close by. the food is very good!! great service very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Was also really quick. Love the wonton soup. Ordered governer chicken and it was delicious without being spicey."}
{"text":"Love Dragon Gate! The new location is lovely and homey, and the food is delicious. Portions are generous and the staff is always friendly and helpful. The wonton soup isn't overly salty, egg drop soup is nicely seasoned, and all entree dishes have been worth ordering again.  I've never had a menu item that wasn't well-prepared and delicious!"}
{"text":"dirty dirty filthy under the booth. I left my food and the restaurant. sickening"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Dragon Gate in a while, so I was due for a visit.  The family agreed and off we went.  Upon arrival, we were the only people in the joint, which I loved, especially because the food is great.  The wife and I ordered the Cantonese dinner for 2, which we used to order when we were dating 15 years ago.  My kids both ordered orange chicken.  And it's not just orange flavored chicken, they actually use oranges and its delicious!  I loved the won ton soup and the hot tea.  Our Cantonese dinner was delicious and included a large portion that we ended up taking home.  I miss the awesome flavor of their fried rice.  It is every bit as good as I remember it.  The flavor and quality of Dragon Gate is very consistent.  THIS is my favorite Chinese restaurant.  I give five stars.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Literally my favorite Chinese restaurant on the West side!  Get the Cantonese dinner for 2 (or more)..."}
{"text":"This place has excellent Chinese food! I always recommend the dinner for two because it gives a great variety of some classic Chinese dishes.  Price is pretty good considering how awesome the food is, the only downer that I would add is that the family that owns and runs the place always seems to make me feel like I'm rushing out of there.  However, they do have a drive thru pick up window where you can order ahead and just take it home with you."}
{"text":"Their Hong Kong chicken is delish, could eat boatloads of it.  Their apps were great too.  The pork and beef dishes I tried were poor, very chewy meat.  We continue to occasionally do pickup from here, but stick to chicken dishes because their chicken is some of the highest quality I have had anywhere.  Doesn't seem processed at all, just clean lean white real meat chicken.  Baffles me that they buy a great quality chicken but their pork and beef is so bottom of the barrel."}
{"text":"I ordered curry chicken, egg drop soup, and a pork and shrimp egg roll at lunch.  Service so far has been quick and friendly. The restaurant is decorated nice and is clean.   Egg drop soup was served within minutes of ordering and was ok. It was way over salted. Makes me think it was poured from a can because it had that taste.   Egg roll was hot and had a freezer taste to it. The orange sauce on the table I used on it tasted more like candy than a sauce it was so sweet.   Chicken curry was served with sautéed onions in a curry oil mixture. It was ok and was also over salted. Spice was appropriate for the dish.   Overall I had a good experience here. Food was good, not great. I'd give it a 2.5, and rounded up I give it a 3.   I won't come back here for lunch because I like to order curry dishes and it wasn't on the lunch menu. I don't like paying dinner prices at lunch. But if I were to get something different and off the lunch menu it's worth a stop since lunches were around $6-7 and came with rice and soup or egg roll."}
{"text":"You can order Chinese food and pick it up at the drive through window. Need I say more?!  Really good food, we live nearby and it is now our go to Chinese food place! Love the General Tso chicken and egg rolls. Always so nice on the phone when you order. There is also a dining room but I have never eaten inside before."}
{"text":"Still great food and service. Pu pu platter.  Dragon steak, fried rice, shrimp w lobster sauce, chicken hong kong style.  Restaurant had nice Chinese decor that made it feel authentic. Glad it's back."}
{"text":"Worst place in this area! The pressed duck is like a sponge cake and is probably not duck. The prices are insane for their tiny portions. We have ordered here many times only because they have a drive thru window and its more convenient with a baby in the back. Any dish i have ever gotten has always been a disappointing waste of my caloric intake and money."}
