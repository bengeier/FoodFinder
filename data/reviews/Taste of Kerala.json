{"text":"Wonderful food at a busy locale in Woodmere/Beachwood. Their puff pastry version of samosas was on point! Kids enjoyed idli sambar, while I had the delectable goat curry with naan. Wifer had a masala dosa which was prepared to perfection. Topped it off with chai and gulab jamun that tasted like mom's. Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"These reviews are fake and fluffy - the kind you have your friends write when you open a restaurant.   Just tried to order takeout. They forgot to put my order in. They forgot to put in the order for the guy I held the door open for. There was a man seated who was being apologized to profusely before being handed a bag of food. Portions coming out of kitchen looked small. The only legit Indian in cleveland is Tandul in Tremont.   The place was chaos, very gentle staff, and I'm not trying to be mean but they have zero place running a dining room or at least one with take out. My friendly advice : dine in only until you've been open 6 Months and increase portion sizes."}
{"text":"I received a message from what is probably a friend of the owner that said \"Stay in Warren and don't come to Beachwood to put down great new restaurants\".  Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet! Great variety of delicious options at a reasonable price. Friendly staff, too. Will definitely return to satisfy my Indian food cravings. Happy to have this place on the east side!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Cleveland, this restaurant is always on my to do list. The food is super flavorful and delicious. I think I've had everything on the vegetarian and non vegetarian menu by now and haven't had a bad dish."}
{"text":"Unique and fantastic Indian food experience. Cuisine from Kerala, state in southwestern coastal part of India. Pronounced Carol-uh.  Owners and staff are very friendly and attentive. A must-try restaurant if you are in the area. My favorite is #43 on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food. We had a large take out order for lunch at work and everyone loved the food(15 people).  Very surprising for my colleagues. But our order was ready in an hour, had everything we needed, and the staff was very polite and sweet. I personally had the Butter chicken and it was awesome, it had a little kick but it was perfect.  We Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  Been every week since they've opened here.  Plenty to choose from for vegetarians and non vegetarians.  My husband is obsessed with #43."}
{"text":"Used to be in Mayfield Heights, the food taste good. The reason I rated 4 stars because the price went up significantly compare to the store used to be in Mayfield Heights."}
{"text":"This spot exceeded my expectations and the customer service was amazing. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good mix of South and North Indian cuisine under one roof.  The staff are very friendly - easy smiles and very responsive.  We got samosas as appetizers- they were excellent, and the 2 chutneys were superb. Particularly liked the spicy one as it went well with the peas and potatoes filling which some would find a bit bland.  The Mysore masala dosa was huge and filling.  The sambhar was very tasty, but it was thicker than what we are used to, and the serving size was small. This turned out to be a non-issue as the waiter gladly brought us extra bowls of sambhar when we asked.  The place was full on Saturday evening so go a bit early. We got there at 6.30 PM and had a great experience but could see the serving staff getting a bit stretched by the time we left around 8.00.  Overall a nice addition to the restaurant scene in the Woodmere area - a more authentic Indian place compared to choolah which is across the street."}
{"text":"I really liked that they have separate kitchens for veggie and meat dishes.  Going that extra step is cool and I have vegetarian friends who I'm sure would appreciate it very much.  The food was pretty good, not my favorite Indian place in cleveland, but quite good and I would definitely return; especially if I'm entertaining vegetarian friends."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in Cleveland so far. More authentic than any other place. Malabar chicken biryani is my favorite item.  Tried their goat fry for the first time today; it was fantastic.  If you have the palate for good spicy authentic Indian food, go to this restaurant, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly owner!  My dad went a few weeks ago and told me I had to try it.  I was hesitant because I am lactose intolerant and it can be a challenge to find dairy free options at Indian restaurants!  They were very accommodating and made my meal with coconut milk instead of cream.  I had the Malabar Chicken (mid) and my dad had the butter chicken (very spicy).  We were both pleased with our food.  Make sure to tell your server your spiciness preference when you order.  The owner came by and spoke with us, he pointed out some other things on the menu that we will be trying next time we go!"}
{"text":"Go here. Seriously. If you like Indian food you're gonna love this place. The owners are super nice and the mango lassi is fabulous."}
{"text":"We ordered a Rava butter masala dosa and black pepper chicken. The Rava masala dosa was really good and cocunut chuttney tasted even better than some places back home in India.  I made sure I ordered only South Indian dishes in lieu of its name. I was told by some friends that black pepper chicken is a frequently eaten dish in South India, hence the order. The chicken was subpar and tasted old. I hope they rectify it.  This is a go to place for typical South Indian Vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"One word, AWKWARD!  I was huge fan of the prior takeout location, see my previous review.  One of my comments, in the prior review, stated that a sit down location would be awesome.   Wellllllll be careful what you ask for.  I visited this past Friday evening.  The restaurant was pretty quiet, just a few other customers, more takeout/delivery orders, it seems.  I was dining by myself.  I was seated and 1 server took my drink order, while another server swept the floor nearby.  I recognized the owner, behind the counter, from my visits to the previous location.  He greeted me warmly, as he always does, to all customers.  From there, it went downhill.  The server that had been previously sweeping the floor, approached to take my order.  I ordered my favorite items, Vegetable Biryani and Samosas.  I asked the server if the entree would be accompanied by naan bread, as some of the other entrees on the menu, she stated that she believed so.  She returned a short while later, to tell me that my Biryani didn't come with naan, but did come with.....and she proceeded to spell out something she couldn't pronounce or describe.  It was so awkward, that I told her that whatever came with the entree was fine.   I proceeded to wait, thinking that the Samosas would arrive as my appetizer, they did not.  My appetizer and entree (including the item that the server couldn't describe, still not sure what it was), arrived about 25 minutes later.  The Samosas were just as I remembered, warm/tasty, not quite as spicy as they used to be, though.  The entree, was not the same, as I had on numerous occasions at the prior location.  This version of the Vegetable Biryani, didn't have the same texture, depth of flavor, nor the same ingredients.  The previous version, had firmer rice, toasted cashews, whole indian spices and the mild version was sufficiently spicy.  This version was a soft bland rice, with frozen mixed vegetables and a few potato cubes.  The accompanying chips?, were pretty decent, reminded me of a cross between a kettle chip with the texture of an asian shrimp chip.  I was never offered a refill on my water.  I had been finished with my dinner for at least 10 minutes, complete with stacking the dishes in the middle of table to signal that I was finished.  No one ever brought the check, even as I started to put on my coat.  I approached the counter to pay my check and left.  I probably won't return.  I miss the old place:-("}
{"text":"My mistake was going with the buffet. I just wasn't thrilled with all of the offerings. The nan was sitting in a warming tray getting soggy and there was very little saffron in the basmati rice.  The positives include the lamb and chicken curries, the atmosphere is clean, and the two gentlemen working the floor were attentive. I'm going to have to return and order off the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food in the city. The service was great as anything I needed was readily available and quickly made. The servers were very friendly, and the owner even came to make sure everything was made the way I like it. A true family owned business, that makes you feel like part of the family while you eat there. The butter chicken and chicken 65 are to die for, and every other dish we tried was just fantastic.  A truly unique and delicious restaurant that deserves a 10/10."}
{"text":"I love goat, and it's hard to find, especially in non-curry form.  This place has a few offerings, and the one I tried today was delicious!  The portions are small considering the high prices, but I may return next time I have a hankering for spicy goat!  The lunch buffet is also priced a bit high for the small offering (I'm used to NYC having low prices and high quality offerings at lunchtime), but most of the dishes were well prepared, and the workers are very nice.  It's nice to have some real Indian food in the area!  Choolah is good but it's not exactly authentic."}
{"text":"I like trying Indian food from places that are not the typical regions that you know of.  I had one of the regional Specialties, Kuttanadan fish. It looks like they provide the side dishes non, etc. depending on the dish so you don't have to try to figure out what you should or shouldn't have. I liked it a lot, my companion thought it was just so-so."}
{"text":"Very good food ! Love the idiappam and mushroom maapaas. Also the kadala curry and aapam is very good. Malabar porotta is very soft and delicious. Malabar chicken curry a huge hit as well. Very nice staff... have already been there 3 times since they opened"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Everyone here is nice. Food is fresh and superb. Im bringing the wife"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous and ..I liked d service too.. Especially Neha thakur was Awesome... Jaab take suraj Chand rahega... Neha Thakur ka Naam rahega...!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Went for lunch and had the buffet. I'm not usually a fan of buffets but this one was great the food was fresh and the chicken was moist and tender not dried out. I was a fan of their other location and would travel there for take out but now it's practically in my backyard and still delicious! Can't wait to come back and order off the menu."}
{"text":"We love the Mayfield takeout-only location, so were excited to check out the new dine-in location. Friendly staff, and good food. Different chefs, so understandably slightly different recipes as the Mayfield location."}
{"text":"Taste of Kerala is awesome on food quality, service, and value- I can honestly say I look forward to the next time I can go back!   I had the mixed vegetable korma (3/5 spice level) and samosas as an appetizer. Not only is it a huge bonus that they include rice and garlic naan with the entrees, everything was super delicious and portions were comfortably filling. I would definitely order the same things again.   To top it all off, service was very attentive and cordial and the value was unbeatable (at least 20% cheaper than cafe tandoor or saffron patch), especially for this quality of Indian food."}
{"text":"Chicken and egg pastry was killer for appetizer, the main courses of Chicken Korma, and shrimp curry was to die for. First time for us but we will come back again and again"}
{"text":"Just ordered masala dosa butter chicken and kuttanandan beef ulathiathu.  Dosa is crispy. Chicken is buttery. Naan is fluffy like clouds. Beef is a tidal wave of spices.  I believe this place will do well. It's a smart move of them to branch out to this location if the keep the food quality up, keep the authenticity. Don't water it down to appease the general public. We already have choolah for that.  We shall return to try the roast duck or duck curry.  Second floor is really hot. Probably because heater is situated right there. Gives you a true ambiance of what it's like to dine in India.....!?  The cook is different from the take-out headquarter, so the flavor may vary.  The menu is very similar. I recognize most items. Having photos in the menu will be very helpful."}
{"text":"This by far was my worst experience at an indian restaurant. waiting almost over an hour to receive my food AND we were the only ones there! i get that they are (or not) making these dishes from scratch but i never want to visit when it's busy bc i would not see my food until the end of the night before they close! The food was so-so. i've had much better panner tikka masala and butter ones that always make me want to come back. that's what it should be all about; on if you return to the restaurant bc of good service and great food!   i did not feel i had good service or good food. the only pro is that the atmosphere was great. 1/5 starts would not recommend going if you are starving and want food right away! bc you're not going to get it!"}
{"text":"Honestly they were the best southern Indian food I've ever had. I was a little skeptical about them moving to Woodmere. Their food on mayfield was awesome and plentiful! I've gone twice and ordered my norm which are a few entrees. The chicken chicken biryani was the bomb in mayfield. With plenty of protein. New place not so much. My dish literally had one cut up thigh with the same dish being 25% more. Not fun. It lack the flavor from compared to the mayfield store. Then I decided I'll try to eat my money back on their buffet. Bad idea. Good menu choices for the buffet stuff that I loved trying for the future (that's what a buffet is about) but again we left disappointed. For lacked the flavor and flair. Taste was too mild even lacking salt. Making me embarrassed that I recommended the place from pervious experience and my guest. My guest thought I was nutz to recommend.  Hey! Taste of Kerala! Let's go! Get it back to norm especially if ur charging more per plate. I hope this huge move wasn't to much for you.  PS I will be happy to discuss this with u face to face. I'm not a coward that hides behind this media.  PS. It's not in the city proper of beachwood it's in the village of Woodmere a little further eastish"}
{"text":"I've been there with my family twice now and each time we've had very good food. We have ordered the Mysore masala dosa, palak paneer, butter chicken, samosas, vandakai masala and fish curry. We frequently travel to India and this is as close to authentic as we can find in the area. If you are sensitive to spice make sure to notify the wait staff. For me, the spicier the better, so I am unable to notice, but others in my family commented that the food was great but spicy. I think south Indian food should be spicy though! I hope they don't make it bland for local palates like so many other Asian restaurants do.  They decor is sparse but also authentic. The wait staff is attentive and seem to care. My new favorite Indian food in the NEO. If it stays consistently good, I see 5-stars in their future. (I'm stingy with the stars)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. I have been to several Indian restaurants all over Cleveland. None of them serve Southern Indian food. So Taste of Kerala is not only amazing in it's flavors, it is unique in Cleveland. The aromatics in the KUTTANADAN BEEF ULATHIYATHU are wonderful. The FISH CURRY is delightful. Don't miss the appum. Not sure I got the name right but it's a pancake that is made from fermented rice. You will beg for more. I say go here and try. For those who are not sure about this type of food, tell your waiter the preferences and s/he will lead you in the right direction."}
{"text":"My friend and I were starving when we got here and absolutely loved the place. The service was excellent, very polite, the wait was normal, and the food was phenomenal! Loads of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. I had a chickpea dish and my friend had the Chicken Korma and we split samosas. The flavors and spices were incredible. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the goat Biryani and most of the dishes they make. You can get it as spicy as you want.  I like that they have Mango lassie's already to go so I can drink some while I wait."}
{"text":"The food was very good! I had the lamb curry and the chicken Tika Masala, with garlic naan, it was all really great food.the atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant, I ordered take out and it was less than fifteen minutes. The portions are big and the prices pretty good !"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant  overpriced for the buffet food which was not even good . Reasonable if the only charge you under $10 but for &14.., you could have gone to a more formal restaurant and get better food . Stay away unless you\"re really starving"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Northern Indian food is what we are more familiar. This is Southern Indian food. Thus we let our waiter suggest the best and ordered from his suggestions. Amazingly delicious. If this were New York, San Fran, or Philly it would be impossible to get a table here. Enjoy Cleveland, you have another gift in Taste of Kerala. Exceptionally delicious."}
{"text":"Wow - I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Ate lunch here on a Saturday.  Only one other occupied table when we arrived which always gives me an \"uh oh\" feeling. But the food was delicious! If Cafe Tandoor is my gold standard for Butter Paneer, this is a solid silver with a very rich, creamy and flavorful sauce.   The service was very good. The owner/chef (?) even personally gave suggestions for vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"The curries are incredibly tasty at Kerala and they are made on the spot.  The staff appear very devoted to high-quality food.  Even under-staffed they whip-up delicious fare.  Plan ahead on weekends orders, as they are popular.  (It's nice to know that families are bringing home something other than pizza for a Saturday dinner.) I plan to return for the Thali (daily platter special) - dine-in only!"}
{"text":"Very high quality, authentic food! We ordered the Malabar Chicken and the Kerala Shrimp Fry. Both dishes were spiced perfectly & had great flavor.   A new location - back behind the Pizza Fire on Chagrin. In my opinion, Taste or Kerala does not even compete with Choolah. If you want real authentic food, this is the obvious choice. The menu has a much wider variety and many vegetarian options. I believe they will be starting a buffet soon with many traditional Kerala dishes.  The owner was very active in the restaurant interacting with all of the people to make sure the food and service was well.   Great experience we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Liked the place, I think that they just opened not too long ago. Good feel to the place, pretty good restaurant site even though it's off the main street a little bit. The wife and I both tried different dishes this time around.  We started with a double order of pakora and they were quite good. Savory with just the right amount of spices. Large amounts of sauce for dipping as well. Well worth the value.  I had a house special: appam- three special pancakes with a sort of vegetable curry. It was nice. I probably wouldn't order it again because I didn't like it as much as my regular chicken tikka masala, but I mean, what can compare to chicken tikka masala? Maybe biscuits and gravy but that is all...  My wife had the potato stew and said the same thing- good but try something else next time (we recently became vegetarian and are still finding our way...).   Like a lot of Indian restaurants, there is no kids menu. The only problem we ran into was that the dishes that we had, and one of the dipping sauces for the pakoras were quite hot. There was no request to spice level on the main dishes like there are in other local Indian restaurants. As a result everything was too spicy for the kids so we had to get her something else to supplement on the way home. We also were less than impressed with the naan. It may be a regional difference, but the naan that we prefer is crispy on the outside and Taste of Kerala's was chewier.  We will be back, this certainly shouldn't sound like a bad review. It was good food and the whole thing was $38 with appetizer and dessert and it fed three of us. Nothing to complain about there. I do worry that the spiciness will be too much for the wimpy midwesterners, but since this is a second location I could very well be wrong on that. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I spent $40 at this place for a takeout meal and I got some frozen ready made parothas, beef ullathiyathu and chicken korma that was tasting really bad. The quantity of each one of the entree's were also very minimal, actually shockingly small. I was very disappointed with the quality and quantity overall. This place is a scam, please avoid. I'm praying that I do not end up with any food poisoning. If there was an opportunity to give no stars I would."}
{"text":"Most authentic Indian food I have had in Cleveland! Beautifully spiced and definitely tastes homemade and fresh. We had one vegetarian dish, one chicken dish and a dosa. The wait staff was knowledgeable, the restaurant understated but lovely and clean, and the music interesting and also authentic."}
{"text":"Came today for buffet lunch. This is the best Indian food in Ohio. Everything is hot and fresh very clean in restaurant. I will be back"}
