{"text":"First time and it didn't disappoint. We were late for our reservation but they were so accommodating. They had a reservation for our table and apologized that they had not told us ahead if time. They simply asked us if we could move to another area which was totally cool since we were 30 minutes late to start with. They were so apologetic that they gave us a complementary dessert platter and port wine. This was totally unexpected and really showed how they value their patrons. Cheers to the management / ownership. Now to the food. Everything was fantastic. We must of had half the items on the menu and all of them were superb to say the least. We had the tuna taco, the rbi shooters, the rock shrimp , blackened cod and spring rolls to name just a few. Thumbs up to our server Ace as well who was alot of fun and very made our experience very enjoyable. No doubt it's a little pricey but we all 4 definitely felt like it was a great evening. Can't wait to go again and bravo again to everyone there."}
{"text":"Everything was great. The rolls had a perfect blend of savory and spice but were rich with toppings and texture. The spicy tuna with rock shrimp roll was something I'm going to be dreaming about for years to come. The truffle albacore roll with truffle oil drizzle was smokey and had a taste with a surprising amount of layers. Finally, the Blowfish giant ebi shooter had within it the biggest shrimp EVER! The soy paper wrapping was pink - so that was fun.  Definitely a great place to go and worth the value."}
{"text":"I came in on a Wednesday night and this place was wonderful! It had a great atmosphere, and modern feel. More business people, but the new patio they have was great! Very fun and upbeat. I had the spicy tuna and roc shrimp - just the right kick. The staff was very friendly and were knowledgable about the menu. All in all it was a great experience, I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Just an amazing experience of freshness and flavors that were mouth watering incredible.  A find and as worthy a sushi cuisine as there is.  Service was consistent, helpful and friendly.  I can't wait for my return trip!"}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy. I crave this place all the time! Only downside, it tends to be on the empty side the few times I've been. But food, service and drinks are great so I would def suggest this place."}
{"text":"Overall, this place is definitely better than Ki.  Atmosphere = Yuppie snobbery   Decor = Very nice  Food = One of the better sushi places in Toronto  Service = Not impressive. I had to wait 5 minutes before my server asked me if I wanted something to drink because not everyone in my party had arrived.The second person who arrived had to wait even longer. . .   Price = High end, but not atypical for restaurants of this caliber.  Service must be better for me to pay that kind of prices again."}
{"text":"I work at the Bay-Adelaide Centre and a colleague and I decided to head to Blowfish for lunch. I'd never been but had been wanting to check it out for a while. We walked through an unmarked wood-paneled door in the BAC lobby and lo and behold, found ourselves in Blowfish. We had made a reservation for 12pm and got there around 11:55 but were seated immediately.  The space was a little smaller than I had expected but with all the one-way glass, regular glass and natural lighting, gave the illusion of being much larger. I was a little disappointed that the menus were on paper - mine looked like it had been handled quite a few times before me. However, I was a big fan of the Pyrex tubes chandelier and the huge gold 10-seat private booth in one corner (now if only we'd had a group of 10 ..)  The menu suggests you order a variety of dishes from the Sushi, Salads and Hot & Cold plates to share. We aren't the biggest veggie eaters so decided to skip on the salads. We ended up ordering: the shrimp, scallop and crab spring rolls (this is one dish! comes with 3 spring rolls), the spicy tuna on crispy sushi rice (6 pieces), the coconut shrimp tempura roll (6 pieces) and the crab roll (6 pieces). I also decided to try the melon thyme drink - my lunch companion spoke highly of it. The waiter was attentive without being overbearing and graciously asked if it was alright if two of the sushi rolls were brought out before the spring rolls and the last roll. At this point, I hadn't paid too much attention to the prices as my colleague and I were lucky enough to be lunching here on the corporate dime.  The crab sushi was quite good - the pieces were rolled well and there wasn't a grotesque amount of rice. However, they weren't very different from rolls you could expect at an AYCE joint. I really liked the coconut shrimp tempura roll - instead of a layer of seaweed, there was a thin dusting of shredded coconut on the outside. I love coconut and the hint of flavour was a nice touch. The spring rolls were like large pixie sticks (I guess that was the \"fusion\" element of Asian fusion...) - unfortunately, they were served in a deep bowl with a thick layer of sauce at the bottom which meant that one end was all soggy. They were also a little too hot and had some strange sweet potato-like filling - I could taste the shrimp in them but nothing else. My favourite was definitely the spicy tuna on crispy sushi rice. The spicy tuna was heaped on little flat pieces of fried sushi rice - yum :) The melon thyme drink was definitely a little different - it was sweet but I liked the little kick of thyme. However, at $6, I don't know if it was entirely worth it.  All in all, the food and decor were quite nice but for the price paid, I'm glad this wasn't being paid for out of my own pocket. Each dish was about $12-$15, which I think is quite over-priced for the quality of the food - hence the 3 stars. I think there is better sushi to be had elsewhere in Toronto at a much better price. I also feel like there is probably better decor to be had in Toronto with much better food."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. We were delayed seating for about 15 minutes but were offered 3 free drinks ! The rock shrimp appetizer was amazing, and the rolls were really fresh. The portions were small and the place definitely isn't cheap, but it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to Nobu in Bahamas. vegas and NYC.. This place blows them out of the water. The sushi is fresh, the flavours are unique. My absolute fave roll is the Rock Shrimp. I was there last night and the service was amazing. The waiter really did go out of his way to ensure we had a great time. I prefer the decor and ambience at this location compared to the King St. one.  I almost fogot to mention start with a Blowfish Shooter and a Pomegranate Martini."}
{"text":"Overall great experience to celebrate husbands 31st bday. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and had great recommendations. Agreed its a bit pricey, but its expected of Toronto and this area. Not as pretentious and much better than Ki. Spicy tuna with rock shrimp and the Albacore tuna with truffle oil were our favourites. The rest were good too, but not outstanding. The grapefruit ginger martini was also highly recommended, but not worth $16. Our waitress surprised us with a slice of cheesecake with a sparkler, which was a nice touch. $160 for 2."}
{"text":"AWESOME. We had the omakase. Every dish was beautifully presented and delicious. Sushi was fresh.  Toro was AWESOME. The stone wagyu was pretty cool.   Service was friendly and attentive. I think it's super important for the waiter/waitress to explain each dish ESPECIALLY when you get omakase.,,,and they did that.   The place was quiet for a Friday evening. It didn't bother me given that we were a group of 7. And,the area is probably quiet on weekend anyway."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the service this place would get five stars. The food, sake and ambiance were great but extremely poor service from our server who could care less and made us feel like we were a bother to her."}
{"text":"Love blowfish both locations. Ebi shooter is a must try and they come in mini verdiond."}
{"text":"I would not recommend, overpriced, mediocre Sushi. The price is much too high - you're basically paying for the location rather than quality Sushi. For a town like Toronto, this place rates as average.  Portions are about tapas sized, but cost $10 - $15 per serving.  We paid about $50 a person and I came out very hungry.  Service was OK ... but informal. Felt like a bar rather than a mid-end restaurant.  Sushi menu is very limited I guess they were going with innovative and creative, but the results is odd.  I say save your money, walk a block, and grab some real Sushi instead.  Context: came for business lunch, it wasn't my money, but I still felt I didn't get value for the money."}
{"text":"Work in the area and tried Blowfish for lunch for the first time this week. Both food and service were incredible. Everything came very fresh (and fast-which was great since I had a business meeting shortly after). It had a super cool vibe and the service was very sweet and attentive. I will definitely be back next date/girls night. My server said they will be changing their name come May to Katana??? Can't see it getting any better!!"}
{"text":"Even if you have a sushi bar, you should not be hungry after you eat lunch when you eat lunch. This is very expensive, but the amount is very small. If you do not want to be hungry, you should eat about three menus. I was so hungry that I had to buy a hamburger again."}
{"text":"Overrated. Japango on Elizabeth is much better. This place is far too pricey for their quality."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It's expensive for sushi but the quality is great. Had the miso black cod, the rock shrimp, and some jalapeño ginger tuna sashimi, and they were all delicious. I would say I wouldn't get the tuna sashimi again for $20. To me it tastes like Singaporean white chicken with ginger, except it was tuna and not chicken. But the cod is amazing and melted in my mouth. Rock shrimp was a bigger portion than I expected.   Would come back. Also they comp parking at Bay Adelaide centre which is great! More money left for great food!!"}
{"text":"Blowfish is a nice enough sushi spot but a tad overpriced.   Mr. H and I started out with Albacore Tuna nigiri and it was not good at all, I mentioned to the waitress and she apologized and it was taken off our bill. I really did appreciate the pro activeness regarding this, we also had three rolls. The truffle albacore was my favourite followed by red hot curry salmon and jalapeño hamachi.  What really impressed me about this place was the service, we had a really good waitress and he made sure we knew in detail regarding every dish we ordered. She made sure to tell us that the red curry salmon was not everyone's favourite and that some people found the jalapeño hamachi a bit spicy. We had them anyway because spice does not bother us and also because they sounded the most interesting. We need the meal with coconut banana fritters and was a little disappointed when it came without it's customary companion... vanilla ice-cream.   The reason for a 3 star review is the presentation. For how expensive the rolls were, I was expecting to be wowed and I was not. Also, the quantity was a little less, the rolls looked like they were on a diet and I left feeling a little dissatisfied.  If I'm going to pay some much, I'd rather go to Yuzu-No-Hana."}
{"text":"Where should I begin.  I travel to Toronto regularly and always make a point to stop at Blowfish.  The spicy rock shrimp is incredible and  the sushi I have had has been excellent!  The service is top notch and the bartenders deserve a 10 for their hospitality.  Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I have been to the other location and was NOT impressed. The second time was the charm. I went for a late lunch 2:45ish and my party was the only one in the restaurant. Our server was catty and had horrible extensions might I add... On to the food...one word Amazing! Salmon Nigiri- amazing Toro nigiri- melt in your mouth yellowtail nigiri- amazing Salmon curry maki- ok not amazing but still good spicy tuna and rock shrimp maki- amazing black and orange roll(not 100% on the name)- amazing wagyu beef striploin- phenomenal  The manager ran the food for us and romanced it well. Will be definitely be back for dinner"}
{"text":"Katana is my headquarters. I work downtown and i love the food,  drinks and especially the employees.   In an area saturated with chain restaurants it's refreshing to be with unscripted staff."}
{"text":"This was a set menu so all we had to do was show up and enjoy the meal.  Two set of apps edamame and sweet potato chips Hand role. The paper it is wrapped in was edible as well. Shrimp with tempura flakes with avocado and mango. Was OK IMO as more of the tech display and conversation piece than anything else as far as the edible paper is concerned. Will go well as bar food. Trio of fish. There was truffle used in this course a poor choice if you intend to enjoy delicate raw fish as it overpowers everything. While I have nothing against people who enjoy truffles I think its abhorrent to use it in a dish for the sake of using it.  Next was sushi sashimi platter. Decent sashimi but again the use of truffle just overpowered the sushi rolls.  Chopped scallops on crispy chicken skin. While I appreciate the attempt to innovate I think cold chicken skin is not my cup of tea. Again will do well as bar food. Innovative yet I somehow don't see it working as warm chicken skin won't go well against raw fish without effecting it to get the temperature correct for the chicken skin to shine.  Corn soup with king crab meat. Surprised me as it was quite good and refined.  Soba. Very poor as I couldn't even finish my portion Bone in Rib eye. Accompanied by peppers and tempura mushrooms. Decent and a nice filler as the last savory course.  Candied pineapple with Sake ice cream caramel and almonds. Very good and sure to please a crowd. Surprisingly refined dessert.  The price we paid was very reasonable IMO. Service was great so bump in half star for that.  To sum it up this place will appeal to booze and fill up seekers so if you are in the area and want to enjoy fusion Japanese this will fit the bill. 3 stars."}
{"text":"After my first disappointing experience at Blowfish, I was invited back after management saw my disappointed review on Yelp. My friend and I had a great meal here this time around and the service was attentive and personal. I also enjoyed the food here, especially the cod. It's not very often we get restaurant management that cares enough to ask customers for a second chance; shows that they really care."}
{"text":"I specifically created a Yelp account to write this review because I was blown away by my terrible experience. I was floored by how a 4 star restaurant on Yelp was able to provide me with such a terrible product.   This was the worst \"sushi bar\" I've ever been to. It pains me to even say that this place \"serves sushi\".   Here is what I ordered:  1) Asparagus tempura 2) Rock shrimp tuna roll 3) Ebi Shooter 4) Truffle Albacore 5) Lobster and shrimp dumpling  The best tasting thing I had from this restaurant were the complimentary yam chips.   The ebi shooter was really bad. It's a regular shrimp handroll, with added mango and avocado, replaced rice with tempura bits and seaweed with soy paper. Why is this so highly touted? You can even imagine for yourself how this would taste. Close your eyes. Imagine it. Yup, thats what it tastes like.   The lobster and shrimp dumplings were ridiculous. There's two of them and it's a har gow from your typical dim sum place except they added \"lobster\" to it. Let's say the whole thing was lobster (it's definitely not), how is this special or worth the eight dollars?   The biggest sin was the sushi rolls. For a \"high end sushi bar\", I'm expecting high quality sushi rice. NOW I understand why the ebi shooter didn't have any rice. Take a look at the picture of the Truffle Albacore roll that I am attaching with this review. You can actually see how flat the rice is. It's literally mushed together. Sushi in Japanese means \"with rice\". They failed at the literal meaning of the word sushi.   The only good thing from my experience with the restaurant was the service. The waiter was apologetic when we showed her the quality of the rice in the Truffle Albacore roll, and the manager was considerate enough to remove both rolls from our table. (Please note that we didn't finish both rolls)  Honestly, we don't mind paying for a high end sushi experience. It's why we decided to go try it in the first place. But this place is simply disappointing and that is being very generous.   Go somewhere else. Please."}
{"text":"Wow! A seriously impressive dinner was made for a group of us here there other night. Chef Albert was at the top of his game with everything we had from the delicious and beautiful soy wrapper hand roll with tempura shrimp and mango to the incredible Sake Ice cream served in a pineapple and dusted with shards of almond brittle.  I'll confess to loving the addition of truffles in a few of the dishes. I always enjoy Japanese fusion, but the classic french twist and unique thoughtfulness that Chef Albert put on things was filled with finesse and flavour. It made for a fun and elegant meal.  Service was fabulous. We sat at one of the round booths and the staff never missed a beat with keeping things clean, refreshing drinks and making sure we wanted for nothing. Everyone was friendly and displayed a real commitment to having fun and doing their jobs well.   Katana is the perfect place to impress a foodie friend or entertain out of town guests. I think it would also be perfect for a date, too. In fact, I don't think you could go wrong here unless you're not a fan of Japanese Fusion. But the point of Fusion, in the end, is to play with several elements of cuisine.   Go. Play."}
{"text":"Having eaten and numerous of the best Japanese in NY and London I would say that for the hype and reviews here Blowfish falls short. For having the image of being Toronto's best, upscale level sushi haunt I would say it is nothing more than average when it comes to food but with a bit of a chic ambiance. The sashimi was pretty decent (it had some sesame and jalapeño) and had its own unique touch but the sushi rolls were very average. The spicy tuna with rock shrimp was ok; the jalapeño hamachi was bland. Both the rolls were a bit mushy. A restaurant of this nature should make their sushi like art and every piece of it should stand out. The final dish was black cod, which perhaps was enjoyed most. No complaints there. Overall, the food was decent enough that we had a good meal but for the food I have had better at some of the cheaper restaurants I have tried elsewhere in the city. I love spending at upscale restaurants with amazing food but this isn't mind blowing at all and I won't plan on making a dedicated effort to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Blowfish at Bathurst and King before and was blown away then by the artistry and quality of the food. So I thought I was prepared. I was not.  Chef Albert and his team put together a custom menu for our (pretty chatty) group that made us all speechless at every course. The meal was a combination of really interesting Japanese/French fusion items from an ebi/mango/avocado/tempura/soy paper hand roll, to yuzu bbq chicken sushi topped with mango, to scallop ceviche served on fried chicken skin(!), to a perfectly seared steak served with an aioli and deep fried enoki mushrooms. A few courses had a couple of extra items left and somehow, no one got stabbed in the neck with a chopstick.  One thing that really stood out was how balanced every dish was. Every bite had a bit of spiciness, tartness, saltiness, sweet and umami all blended together perfectly. The flavours were all at once delicate, and striking, with nothing overpowering the other flavours. I'm not sure I've ever had a meal that was so consistently balanced all the way through, while still being incredibly, heart-breakingly tasty.   I came out of the dinner thinking one thing: Chef Albert is probably some kind of magical demon that must be destroyed. So before the apocalypse hits and the battle between good and evil, angels and demons, man and beast falls upon us, you should really check out Katana and take in an incredible meal."}
{"text":"Wow. I ate so much I think I exploded right after I was finished. We had a 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 course meal prepared for us by the chef which included special ribs, a massive sushi platter, some pork belly sandwich things, killer hand rolls, and many other dishes that were just spectacular.   The decor in here is great and the set up is high end for sure. Make sure you bring your wallet filled with cash because this is not your typical run of the mill sushi joint.  However if you want impress a hot date or splurge a little bit I would recommend coming here.  The servers were great and were extremely attentive to us. They did not forget a thing and also laughed at all our jokes which is always a big bonus in my books!"}
{"text":"Nice place, hip with loud music and you can drop of your coat with the hostess. Fancy inside with a lot of business dressed people that all seem rich! Service is nice and oh so SLOW! One of our rolls came with the appetizers , the other ones literally 20 min later, it was not even that busy. Good sushi , truly nice appetizers also, but the service seriously lacks at the beginning we got complimentary edamame ( thanks) and as we didn't now about it we told the guy that we didn't order it, inbetween the pumping beats of michael Jackson he just shrug, sat it down and mumbled \" commentary\" . Bill took good 5 mins to arrive also. Oh well there are tons of cheaper and better places right around the corner"}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelor party so we had a set menu of over 10-12 dishes including a sushi platter, ribs, pork belly sandwich, shrimp hand roll with edible paper, raw scallops just to name a few. Overall, the food was decent but it was also a confusing mix as I am not sure if this a full on Japanese restaurant or an Asian fusion restaurant. The sticky ribs and pork belly sandwiches were good but a weird combination with the rest of our meal. The sushi platter was good but some of the rolls lacked flavour.   The service was above average as we were the only table at the restaurant during this time. The servers were attentive and friendly. The manager also offered a free shots for the table which was a a nice treat for the group.   Overall, a great experience. You definitely pay for the ambience and service here over the quality of their food."}
{"text":"The service was second to none. The decor and set-up was comfortable. Above all, I liked the food. Generally I'm not a fan of raw fish, or the usual run of the mill  roll. I was pleasantly surprised, and will sure to return to sample the other menu items. Note, make sure you have plenty of room on your plastic; otherwise, you may leave with a partially filled tummy."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here Friday night (walking distance from eaton centre) and had an amazing experience! The dining area was full and the bar was empty so we sat at the bar and ate. We ordered spicy salmon, gold king crab, and black + orange. ALL OF IT WAS MADE AMAZINGLY!  The bartender was so busy and even then she provided us with excellent, friendly and prompt service!   We were very ordinary with drinks but when I go next time (there will definitely be a next time) I will go for more of the fancy stuff!!"}
{"text":"Got rave reviews from friends so checked it out  Good menu and food  I can't compare it to places in BC... they've got unlimited access to super fresh fish"}
{"text":"Dropped by for a drink and to check out Zarks much talked about bar.  Disappointed to learns from our server Zark sold the place three years ago and only maintains the King location. Also to note, as of May 1st, the name will change to Katana and focus on their overly priced Japanese cuisine and sake! After taking a quick look at the menu and observing the dishes ordered by the table adjacent to me, I think I will stick to Kii for my Japanese sushi fusion fix. We ordered two $16 dollar each martinis (gin martini & an old fashion), both nothing to brag about!  After our order the server mentioned they have a happy hour each day for rail drinks at $6 a pop!!?!?  Not cool! My verdict: Bay St. types who have $$ to spend and don't know any better will enjoy this spot, but if you are looking for a vibe and value for your dollar go elsewhere, anywhere!!"}
{"text":"This is my first review and I'm only writing one because  the food was so terrible I feel compelled to share my experience with everyone. Seriously we don't understand how this restaurant has 4 stars.  We ordered the ebi shooter which everyone raved about, the rock shrimp tuna roll, lobster and shrimp dumplings and the albacore truffle roll. Ebi shooter did not live up to expectations. I don't understand how it's $14 when they simply put together a piece of shrimp, avocado, mango and tempura bits wrapped in soy paper. Nothing special.   The dumplings were a joke. Essentially 2 har gows for $8 dollars but worst part is that har gows are even tastier at a Shanghai 360 at the mall food court or a mediocre Chinese restaurant. Biggest rip off.   Now onto the rolls which was the ultimate failure and disappointment. This was probably one of the worst rolls I've ever eaten and I am a huge fan of maki rolls. The rice was COMPLETE mush. You can't even see the separate grains of rice. The rock shrimp roll was slightly better only because the rock shrimp was bigger than the roll itself and its taste overpowered the pathetic tuna wrapped in my half rice porridge. But the albacore truffle was just a disaster. I swear the quality is worse than all you can eat maki rolls. Even Loblaws sushi is probably better. At least they can make some decent rice.  I'd like to stress that I am more than willing to spend money on food. Even if it is small portions, it is not of concern as long as the quality is up to par and can justify the price. In this case, it did not. Even the presentation was very amateur. The complimentary yam chips or whatever was probably the yummiest thing we had there.  Aside from that, service wasn't an issue. They were very accommodating and apologetic when we made a complaint about the rolls. They remade it but the rice was still just as terrible. Just by looking at it, I didn't even want to try it. Took one bite and got my confirmation. We asked them to take it back, manager came out and they were kind enough to take it off our bill which we did appreciate.  Bottom line is that this place needs to get a new chef, change the menu or reposition itself somehow. Looking trendy and posh isn't going to cut it anymore when the sushi scene has become so big and competitive in Toronto. With players like Ki, Yuzu no Hana, JaBistro and Kasa Moto just to name a few, I can't see Blowfish surviving for very long. One thing for sure is that I won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"Best thing on the menu - spicy tuna and rock shrimp roll. Hands Down!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to dislike this restaurant since everyone talks about it, its location on Bay Street and its trendy décor as a fusion Japanese restaurants makes me crazy. I was avoiding the restaurant until my colleague who is doing me a serious favor wanted to go for lunch here (his favorite spot). He described it as the \"best sushi restaurant in Toronto\".   We ordered 6 dishes to share and to my amazement they were delicious especially the shrimp in the cone, made with edible paper. Now, it's not the best sushi in town by far, but to their defense they don't pretend to be. It is a trending restaurant, the people eating here are Bay Street type (at least during the day ) and likely expensing it, since our bill was $149 (all in and non alcoholic drinks).   So dress up nice and be prepared for a big bill when you go, but expect the food and service to be good.   In our world class city, we need these trendy restaurants to compliment the hole in the walls. It is what makes living in Toronto great....."}
{"text":"Never disappointed. Often have lunch at the bar. Big Bay Street crowd at lunch. High end but not stuffy. Have never been with a large group but tapas style is great for sharing. The rock shrimp on tuna rolls is a must have - a personal favourite (and much better than Kasamoto's). The mixed greens with pear is a nice starter. The sushi and sashimi is very high quality.  I love black cod and they do a fine job. The staff are quite attentive."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service. The bartender was great and the atmosphere was cool and relaxed. I can't comment on food, as I was only here to waste time before a reservation. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked amazing though!"}
{"text":"Really, this is closer to a 3.5  I've heard lots and lots about Blowfish so I had to come.  Before Blowfish, the only sushi I've had is at AYCE places and here and there at a random Japanese/Fusion Restaurant, so it was definitely an experience for me.   Must add that the table we sat on is the one featured on the menu on the website. Kinda cool.    I was a tad bit drunk, but I remember everything clearly.  The service was fantastic. I must add that. The decor was over the top. I kinda felt like..white people overdoing the japanese thing.   And that basically sums up the whole experience.  While the food was really good, it just didn't live up to what I expected.  Let's talk food.  We had:  1. The Spicy Salmon maki - Basically my favourite item. It was the best spicy salmon I've ever had. The green onions really popped, and the flavours were extremely well balanced here.  2. The Rock Shrimp maki : It was devoured by my friends and I, it was delicious but too over the top. The roll comes with the deep fried shrimp on top, which I felt took away from the rest of the roll. Honestly don't even know what was in the rest.   3. The Red Curry Salmon : Again, I thought the sauce was way too overpowering. I couldn't even make out the salmon in this one.  4. Coconut Bay : I wasn't wowed by it.   5. The Wagyu Beef Gyoza was mad delicious. MAD DELICOUS.  6. The Albacore Tuna was really good. It had a delicous garlic chip that really made the roll.  7. The Chili Berries Saketini was awesome. A little too sweet for my tastes, and I was hoping it would be a touch spicier, but delicious none the less.   All in all it was a great experience. I would defo go back, but it was about 60 a person."}
{"text":"I visit Blowfish on Bay every time I am in Toronto for work. The food is amazing. The Spicy Tuna with Rock Shrimp is one of my favorites. The atmosphere is great to say the least. It caters to whatever you want. You can have a nice quiet meal in their dining room or head into the bar to have some cocktails and be in a great social setting. The bartenders are personable and attentive. The crowd is always there to have a good time. Definitely a place i will continue to visit."}
{"text":"I went here for a business lunch, originally looking for Blowfish and realizing that it is now Katana. We ordered seaweed salad, sashimi (shrimp), spicy tuna on crispy rice, and a spicy tuna roll. We finished with the donuts with black bean ice cream for dessert. It is a very classy place, and the food was great! On the pricier side (with tip included, we paid $103). I would come back here for another business lunch."}
{"text":"Katana is a nice place. Service is good. Ambiance is good. Food is 3 stars across the board. We got a variety of dishes. The rock shrimp was good as was the salmon sushi. The ribs was very soft but a little bland and desserts are not their forte.   Overall we had a good evening. 3/5."}
{"text":"To die for: beef, Hamachi,  lobster and crab meat dumplings.  To kill for: everything else!"}
{"text":"I am not one for Sushi and not a huge fan of the whole Blowfish phenomena. Frankly, I just don't get Sushi. I don't mind it once in awhile but if the choice was mine a Great Steak beats raw fish any day. Having said that, I took my wife to Blow because she LOVES Sushi and Blowfish. Must say, I did not mind it. The food was good and I quite enjoyed what we ordered. Now, the thing that will always make or break a restaurant is the service. You can have the greatest food but if you service sucks good luck getting me back to your establishment. Blowfish will have me back just on the service alone. The server was knowledgeable when it came to the food and even suggested a few dishes we quite frankly enjoyed. Now, I most likely will not be coming here with my guy friends but when it comes to my wife, I am more than happy to share the Blowfish experience with her."}
{"text":"I would definitly come back for its food. its not the traditional Japanese cuisine but everything is very special and tasty. The environment is very relax and comfortable. I recommend you to try tuna taco and and rbi shooter in the cold plate menu. very very yummy!!!  I also tried salmon and tuna sashimi, very solid quality, extremely fresh! I don't even want to go other place for sashimi anymore! The price is a little bit high but the quality and tasty is definitely worth it. Oh, they also have very intersting flavoured sake~  go and try it : )"}
{"text":"2nd time here, first night was great, this time on a Tue night  around 9pm in May 3 tables taken, yet still service not the best , food so so, somehow it felt like the chef did not find the love for his food tonight."}
{"text":"One of the first things you notice is that the restaurant has a fruit fly problem - which is also the last thing you want to see in an 'upscale' sushi restaurant.  I ordered the Salmon Nigiri and Spicy Tuna with Rock Shrimp on the recommendation of my bartender. Even for 'fusion', I was a bit confused by the thing that showed up in front of me. Why was there a deep fried ball of macerated stuff on top of my sushi roll? What's with the orange stuff it's slathered in?   While I get that the restaurant is trying to angle for some level of sophistication, frankly, the presentation was amateurish.   To be fair, the food tasted alright, and the fish was slightly fresher than your average Toronto sushi joint.   Service was friendly and fast, with a nice big bar separated from the dining room - perfect for a quiet lunch away from the crowd.   For the purposes of a business lunch: the atmosphere is broken only by the soft strains of an indie soundtrack and the low chatter of other diners; the wait staff is non-intrusive.  Honestly, the price is not worth the quality but the service kind of makes up for it. Just don't expect to be blown away.  I expected more, considering one of those listy-things rated Blowfish on Bay as one of the best Sushi restaurants in Toronto. If you're looking for a decent sushi experience in the Financial district, I would say stick to Yuzu-No-Hana."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now. Sushi and sashimi is very good, fresh and reasonably priced. I would recommend their rolls. Their cooked food is a disappointment - the hamachi in hot oil was very fishy and the tempura left something to be desired. Service is attentive at the most part but could be slightly improved. I would recommend only getting the rolls and sashimi if you are coming here."}
{"text":"*This review is just for drinks.*  Came here on a weeknight with a friend who works in the area. The vibe is very chichi and akin to places like Ki or Maro. It's dark and moody with sleek, minimalist design. There's a DJ booth by the door, but there wasn't anyone spinning when we were there. I found the service to be attentive and not pretentious. We were greeted warmly and asked if we wanted to check our coats, then offered seats either at a table or at the bar. We picked a quiet table near the back. The crowd was definitely very Bay St., with sugar daddies in suits and trophy mistresses, but if you're just there to enjoy a cocktail and chat, it doesn't matter too much...   The bar area is long and skinny, with a thoughtfully placed ledge so that if it's busy and you are standing, there's still somewhere to put your drink. You can see the fresh sushi ingredients on one end. Also, the unisex washroom is swanky! Each stall has huge floor to ceiling heavy doors and the back wall has a long fish tank! A bit random, but unique I guess.   As for drinks, there are a bunch of saketinis, along with other yummy sounding cocktails. Cocktails run from around $14-18. I had the mango passion and it was strong and sweet. I think it would be *too* sweet for some people, but I have a real sweet tooth so I liked it. They brought out some complimentary edamame, which was a nice touch.   I wouldn't rush to come back here, but thoroughly enjoyed this visit. It's just not really my scene (for a nice cocktail, I'd go across the street to the Gabardine)... But it is a nice place and it definitely gets points for design and ambiance."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday and it was definitely a good experience. We shared some rolls and appetizers and we are now still talking about the rocky roll and tuna taco. After dinner we stayed a little longer and tried couple of their cocktails, which are absolutely delicate. Thanks for giving us such a good time!"}
{"text":"We came here based on the highly rated reviews on Yelp and friends and we did the share the same experience as them.  \"Luckily\" for us, it was not busy so we'd assume that we did not have to deal with wait times and the food being prepared for us would have been dealt with much more attention.  Sadly, this is probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a sushi restaurant, yet alone one of this status.  The majority of the food that came to us was cold and to be honest, I've had better sushi/sashimi in bento boxes."}
{"text":"Katana on Bay is written faintly on the windows of where it's located. I almost walked pass by, and never knew it was a restaurant even though I both live and work in this area.   I came here during lunch on a weekday, mainly for their Spicy Tuna with Rock Shrimp - it looked amazing in photos!! Service was decent, speed of the food was decent (crucial for lunch on a work day). When my food arrived, it looked just as amazing is it did in photos. Beautiful presentation, neatly aligned on a clean plate. But that's when all the good stuff ended. The quality, combination, and taste of the roll was not good. Rice was too hard and bland to eat pleasurably. Tuna was not even cold? And I could barely taste and see the tuna inside the roll. Rock shrips looked pretty, but the flavour of the sauce that was covering the shrimp was nothing special. In other words, it was once again, bland."}
{"text":"Very very good sushi!! This place was amazing from the decor to the service and the great tasting food and drinks! They even had one of the coolest bathrooms I've ever seen at a restaurant! Highly recommend checking this place out if you're ever in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Their tuna soft shell crab roll and tuna taco are absolutely AMAZING! Happy waitresses and awesome service:))"}
{"text":"Having been to Blowfish before, i can really see a huge change- The new head chef takes it to a new level and the food really is impressive. The team are doing a phenomenal job in the kitchen.   Service is excellent and on point. Manager is extremely accommodating. If you would like something special done, talk to them before hand and they really will go out of their way to make it happen.   I'm glad Blowfish is at the calibre they are currently at. There aren't many upscale japanese options downtown, and knowing that you can rely on Blowfish is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch gathering on a Monday. We sat on the patio. Service was great. Patio is nice, located on Temperance and sufficiently removed from the hustle and bustle of the Financial District.   To start, we got a round of Katana hand rolls for the table and tuna tartare. Both were delicious. For mains, we had the roasted miso-marinated black cod, which was crusty on the outside and juicy in the inside. Overall, it was a fine dining experience. They also have a great wine and sake selection. I will be sure to come back with friends."}
{"text":"This place was really great overall! Surprisingly low prices given the quality of atmosphere, presentation, and food! I was shocked at my bill, in a good way! I sort of \"accidentally\" ate vegetarian because the options looked soooo tastey, and they were. I think the roll I got was called the Okinawan (?), it had great flavor and texture but probably could have been sliced into just one more piece than it was as it was really a lot of food in the mouth at once. Really great spot, I would go back in a heartbeat! This place is excellent for entertaining a swanky (financial district) crowd. There was an awesome DJ the night we went that must have been making a playlist from our table's collective brain, cuz we were LOVING it.   When we first walked in however this young server/hostess told us the kitchen was closing soon and we almost left because we didn't want to rush. Then the manager came over and told us the kitchen was open for several more hours and was SO friendly with such a vibrant personality. She was really awesome, I almost wanted to invite her to join us as she was so personable. The girl who greeted us initially really needs to go though, she almost turned away a table of 8 or 9 people (one of them a dignitary visiting from overseas). If the manager hadn't stepped in they would have lost that business and probably more business from us in the future. That hostess needs to go."}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance .   Complimentary popcorn :)   I loved their tuna taco and my friend really liked their tuna tartare."}
{"text":"Blowfish on Bay has a nice bar which is good for after work drinks. I haven't been enjoying the food quality as much as I used to so I just order a snack instead of dinner. Atmosphere is upscale and the crowd is generally cheerful."}
{"text":"Let's just say I don't understand japanese fusion food but this place is seriously overrated... Came here cuz of the four star review and I really dont get the hype"}
{"text":"Simple enough. Best sushi in Toronto. Yes it's expensive but it's just phenomenal. Had the shooter and asked to have tuna instead of shrimp. Amazing. Had the truffle tuna roll, the soft shell crab, and the scallops. All were absolutely fantastic.   Only qualm, they were utterly short staffed but the staff did their best to keep up."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Friday night. Sushi was pretty good.  Hot food was not so good (udon, almond calamari, and crispy beef).  Portion was pretty small but that is to be expected, but the rude service was definitely not.... among other unprofessional acts, she rolls her eye at us just because we didn't hear her clearly the first time. (I mean really? In front of customers at a place like this? )  \"Can you please help us split the bill in 5?\"  Server - *pause..*stares at us... *hand signalling us to hurry up - \"okay. Hurry up and pull out your calculator\"  --  The male kitchen helper was extremely prudent and constantly inquired how our night was going. Very nice guy."}
{"text":"These guys make some seriously tasty food.  The new patio will be wonderful once the construction is finished.  I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"This place has replaced Ki for me as my favorite Asian fusion restaurant.  It is on the pricey side but not outrageous.    The Pomegranate mojito was amazing.  I ended up having two of them.  The presentation was so pretty I had to take a picture of it.     The rock shrimp and the black cod were also superb - it is hard to choose my favourite between the two of them.  I am crazy about Black Cod and this dish was better than the one served at One in Yorkville!    The spicy tuna on crispy rice and the orange and black rolls were delish.  The miso soup was slightly better than the typical.    I can`t wait to go back..."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but not exceptional by any means. The portions are small and the taste doesn't really justify the price. Service is also insanely slow. The time between plates was very inconsistent, and this was on a Saturday with maybe 2-3 other tables in the entire restaurant. It took far too long to get our food.  Still, the restaurant is nicely decorated and has an intimate atmosphere to bring a date. However, unless you're spending a lot, you'll probably leave hungry. For what you're paying, I would expect the service to be a little better. Not the best sushi I've ever had, but definitely one of the more expensive ones. Nice to try, but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"A decent surprise! I was referred to this place after a site visit by a native. She told me it was the best in the area for what I was looking for (Asian inspired cuisine). I really enjoyed the decode and ambience of the space. The food was pretty good as well. I didn't quite enjoy the price, but the exchange rate was pretty great at the time so it doesn't bother me as much. Seriously, $5 for a side of white rice (see prices).   Would recommend though."}
{"text":"Slow service, really bad sushi. Nothing compares to Vancouver but I've definitely had better in Toronto. Would not come here again. Oh, and also over priced!"}
{"text":"The blowfish giant ebi shooter is to die! So is the watermelon mint sangria sake. Anyone who knows me knows I appreciate a good washroom and these ones are the best! There's goldfish tanks in each stall. Any time I go to the Blowfish on Bay with friends we end up meeting a group of cute business guys and going out with them after. Great spot. Tough to get a table so make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Blowfish since it opened.  It has always been my go to for special occasions and I am a big fan of the EBI shooter.  My husband frequents Blowfish regularity with clients for dinner and lunch. In the past, the service has been exceptional at both locations.  I chose to go to the king street location for my birthday tonight with my husband.  The front desk person was not very inviting and not accommodating.  I had requested a seat near the window. She made a big deal and reluctantly seated us by the window after I promised we would be gone by 8:30pm. At this point, I almost wanted to leave.  The waitress was pleasant enough but served us our drinks came back and took the empty glasses without asking us if we wanted another one.  She needs to dress appropriately when serving customers in an upscale restaurant.  She had huge noticeable stains on her black dress. It was very distracting and unappetizing. My husband had called ahead and requested a special dessert to celebrate my birthday.  We were given a dessert menu.  At this point, we were fed up and left at 8pm (reservation was for 7pm.) I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I will not be coming back and my husband will not be taking his clients here.  There are plenty of restaurants that appreciate repeat customers and know how to treat people willing to spend big $$$ for quality food and service."}
{"text":"The dinning experience was great. The ambiance with the trendy decor and music added a nice touch. Service was also on par. But the food was a bit under my expectation. Maybe due to the fact that I had higher expectation due to many positive reviews.  Other than that its a nice place to bring clients or co-workers for a drink as its situated right in the financial district."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of coming to blowfish twice now for work functions.  The pluses: the service here is great (very friendly and knowledgeable.) and they have beautiful decor.  The sushi here is amazing- the fish is fresh, the rolls are inventive and delicate and beautifully presented.  In one case, we had a hand roll made of pink soy paper instead of nori, which was a delicious alternative.  The minuses: it is very loud here and tough to have a conversation.  The entrances off Bay Street (and from the E&Y building) are really hard to find!  And generally it is pretty expensive, so probably not a place the average person could come to often.  Lastly, during my second visit one of the dishes we ordered - crab - tasted like it had not been completely defrosted.    Despite that, all in all, I would say that it's probably the best place to get sushi in the financial district!"}
{"text":"Not being a big fan of sushi, I was a little skeptical about trying this place, but went due to a recommendation by a friends. I was very impressed by it's trendy decor and excellent service. The food was on par. Would definitely recommend to any sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Came here pretty excited as this place has had high reviews. Unfortunately I left unsatisfied and annoyed because I was kept waiting for so long. The food was good - some things were more notably standout than others; However, not good enough to justify the price. If their service was better, perhaps it would help justify the pricing however while the interactions were nice and hospitable, it was all so painfully slow. We had to wait so long between each dish. Considering the dishes were small and quick to eat, I'd expect them to come out smoothly one right after another.. but it was definitely an unacceptably long wait between each."}
{"text":"Blowfish is an elegant, beautiful, and classy Japanese fusion restaurant on Bay and Adelaide. They have some of the most unique menu items and can definitely attract food adventurers, putting aside of course the hefty price.  ======YOU MUST Blowfish Giant Ebi Shooter ($14, tiger prawn, mango, avocado, cucumber, lettuce, daikon sprout, tempura bits, spicy kewpie, tobiko; wrapped with soy paper) - You see the current Yelp cover image for Blowfish? That Pomegranate Mojito glass? This shooter comes in that glass. It's actually a handroll sushi but instead of seaweed it's wrapped in soy paper. It's absolutely delicious! Mind your manners here!  Tuna Taco ($16, diced tuna, negi, frizee, daikon sprout and Japanese tartar; served in crispy wonton taco) - Amazing, so yummy and it's stuffed with tuna. They were not stingy! The tuna tastes very light in flavor so it blends well with all other ingredients.   Spicy Rock Shrimp ($20, tempura style, tossed in hot garlic kewpie sauce) - If you're a huge shrimp fan, THIS IS A MUST. These are giant fat shrimps drenched in amazing spicy sauce. But nothing overpowers another!  One more item (I forgot!!!!) I believe it was a some sort of tuna tataki. It comes in a long plate with lots of slices. The sauce is a little (teenie weenie) sweet and it brought out the tuna flavor extremely well. The tuna tataki was very fresh, not smooshy soft (I hate those!), and thick.   ======OTHER SO-SO ITEMS I SHOULD POINT OUT... Golden King Crab ($17, king crab, treviso, egg, pine nuts, avocado, cucumber, asian spices, golden tobiko) - I thought this tasted quite boring... the crab had very little flavor, the avocado stood out so much.   Sea urchin sushi - Too soft, watery, not flavorful. I've had better.  ======CONCLUSION This place can get expensive if you'd like to try lots of items. Don't be boring and order \"regular\" items like spicy salmon (you can get that anywhere! Although Blowfish does make an amazing spicy salmon roll), go for something different and enjoy it!   Service? 3 stars. Hit and miss, which is unacceptable given its location. Nonetheless, the GOOD waiters and waitresses here are very hospitable and polite.  ======I MUST MENTION THE LOOK & FEEL... Blowfish is truly modern and beautiful. Dim, classy lighting. Full bar to the right, coffee tables to the left by the window. It also has this booth table where it feels as though you are engulfed in a large open barrel. It's not scary, sorry. It's a round table at the center of a giant wooden-like barrel, it's like a mini lounge. It feels nice, promise. The washrooms are shared male/female (and it's quite dirty...), each stall is complete with a fish tank -with mini fish."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for a pre birthday celebration. The restaurant is split down the middle by vertical dark wood panels separating the bar side from the dining room. Absolutely love the trendy modern decor and cool chic vibe this place emits. We were seated along  high black leather banquet at a dark wood table with candle light.  Our waitress that evening was very helpful giving us suggestions of what to order and describing items for us. We decided to order an assortment of things try.  To drink I ordered a Green Tea which came in a cute clear teapot steeped with green tea leafs.  My fiance got the Junmai sake served cold (instead of warm) which he enjoyed to the last drop  To start complimentary Edamame was served steaming hot with coarse sea salt.  Onto the food:  Chicken Kara-age - lightly battered chicken breast, avocado, lettuce, red tobiko, mango, strawberry kewpie Not only beautiful presented but a delicious assortment of flavours, the roll hit all marks from crunchy chicken & fresh lettuce, creamy avocado, slight tartness from mango and sweetness from strawberry kewpie. Just a total delight to eat!  Pan-Seared Ribeye Beef + enoki roll with teriyaki reduction Definitely my favourite dish of the evening! This is a MUST order! The teriyaki reduction had a delicious deep rich taste to it and the tender beef stuffed full of mushrooms. I could of easily devoured two orders of this!  One-Bite Wagyu Gyoza - pan seared dumpling stuffed with wagyu, black fungus, ginger and preserved spicy vegetable; served with balsamic basil dip Nice crisp exterior enclosing a juicy tender juicy waygyu beef filling...how can you go wrong here  Pan Seared Wild Sea Scallops - served with marinated fresh wasabi Jumbo perfectly cooked sweet scallops with a nice seared exterior plus a slight kick from the wasabi  Panko-Crusted Chicken Breast - served w/ three-mustard miso sauce and seasonal greens Super crunchy crust (KFC take notes) surrounding tender very juicy white meat chicken breast. I enjoyed dipping every piece into the flavourful miso sauce  For Dessert:  Flourless Chocolate Torte - w/ coconut mousse and spiced orange chantilly cream Deep dark chocolate layers alternating with fluffy coconut mousse was a delicious combo. The waitress even adorned my dessert with a sparkler and candle which was a nice touch!  Green Tea Ice Cream - Creamy matcha flavoured ice cream double scooped in a martini glass was also a hit  Blow fish is a definite hot spot to check out. Service was amazing and the cool interior and vibe sets the mood for a great a night out.The food hits all the marks and the fusion of flavours and textures is a must try!"}
