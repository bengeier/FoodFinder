{"text":"I would not go back to this diner. I looked past the very dirty floors and half wiped table, hoping for a good greasy spoon. Though our server was kind and attentive, the food was terrible. I had two eggs over easy - which were cooked perfectly. But the sausage served was two grey hunks of spicy Italian sausage rather breakfast sausage and the hash browns had a funny taste. The kids had chocolate chip pancakes and regular. All 4 children had a few bites and couldn't eat them because they tasted \"off\". I tasted them and can confirm they were terrible. The right spot of the meal was the French toast that my child ordered. It was good and the serving was large enough to share."}
{"text":"N. Main Diner has great food and nice servers. I especially like their new menu with southwest items like huevos rancheros.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. The homemade corned beef hash is amazing and the most expensive thing on the menu is like 14 bucks. Never busy so expect to always get your drinks filled . Great breakfast I come here whenever I have the chance"}
{"text":"We tried to go to the North Main Diner on 3 different nights in the past week and a half during business listed hours, and they were closed ... I mean completely dark, and not answering their phone.  I dunno what gives, but we're not likely to drive out to Chagrin Falls to repeat the experience."}
{"text":"Great food, and great service. I got a biscuit sandwich and it was amazing, and my girlfriend said the same for the vegetable lasagna. I will go there again, and I would highly recommend it over other diners. I went there around two on a Saturday, and there was plenty of staff. All of the food was fresh and delicious, and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Why go to Yours Truly when there is never a wait, prices are great, and food is delicious at North Main Diner? May be the best kept secret in Chagrin Falls. Wait 30-45 minutes at YT if you must, but try this diner and you'll never go back to waiting forever while standing inches from seated customers in a narrow, crowded, windy doorway. And that's while the weather is beautiful. Once it gets colder, there's even more waiting, waiting, waiting, and did I mention waiting-- while freezing your butt off.  To go to YT with young kids, you must be nuts, as North Main Diner beckons three doors away. A lifelong YT fan, I'm never going back."}
{"text":"I just had the old Dinks burger(Mawby burger) and their delicious creamy coleslaw and french fries with herbs, vanilla egg phosphate oh my God it was absolutely delicious!! It was so great to see Beth there working! The even bigger surprise is the owner Jack Krissinger what a surprise I can't believe he made this place a great restaurant again I'm so happy I came here! I will definitely be back the food was delicious the atmosphere is pleasant and the prices are right!!!"}
{"text":"Tried again. Went with friends for brunch because they had a coupon they wanted to use. All agreed food was not good and no one wants to go back."}
{"text":"It was difficult for me to come to a star rating decision... I personally would give my breakfast 4 stars but my boyfriend did not like his breakfast at all. I enjoyed my avocado eggs... Described in the menu as \"casserole\" but it was eggs layered on top of avocado. Still good. My boyfriend got the mashed potato cakes and was very disappointed. They were... Wet... And runny... I think we were both expecting more like a potato pancake. He said they still tasted \"okay\", but was more angry that he ordered eggs \"over hard\" ( he hates runny eggs) and they came out over easy at best. This is a big pet peeve for a breakfast place to not cook eggs to order. It's not that hard. The food came very fast and the server was friendly but i would have rather the food take longer and come out more cooked. I might go back but I'd have to convince the boyfriend to come with..."}
{"text":"North Main has potential. As long as they replace the kitchen staff with some common sense. 1) I had a burger that tasted more like a pile of salt with egg and cheese on it. 2) My wife ordered a meat lover's omelette: Who the hell mixes spicy Italian Sausage in with bacon and ham and doesn't specifically say it on the menu? Nobody would order that for breakfast on purpose! We may give North Main another chance. But it won't be any time soon."}
{"text":"Good basic, diner style breakfast very reasonably priced.  This place was a great deal.   Breakfast for four was under $25.    Tried the egg and avocado casserole bake which I liked and was a healthy option.   Waffles and pancakes for the kids plus all the usual diner style favorites.  Small place so not a great option for larger parties."}
{"text":"Stopped in while exploring the town. It was warm, charming and a very interesting place. The food was quick and very good! Service was good too. Typical diner, glad I stopped in"}
{"text":"We only went for breakfast.  There weren't too many people in when we went.  Very snowy morning.  We were fans of the old place.  My hash browns were  not cooked through.  Bummer.  I don't know how with 4 people we ended up with $70 breakfast bill?  Seems like a lot of add ons.  When previous place was much less for similar meal.... Not his fault, ours for not watching the total.  I guess I'd say that it lacks ambiance.  Every place else has ambiance. We may try it again."}
{"text":"Diner has tremendous heart. My two little girls enjoyed themselves munching on their flaky waffles while I enjoyed a spinach omelette (ask for the owner's special homemade hot sauce, you'll like it)."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast at a reasonable price and friendly staff; what else can you ask for?  Chicken Fried Steak was a little tough but the flavor was good; no other complaints from anyone in our party of 6.  Chef made cinnamon rolls that were fresh & tasty.  Owner came by & gave us the history of his short ownership; hope this place makes it!  He has some great ideas for if and when the weather breaks; plan on coming back this summer to give them a try."}
{"text":"Really liked it ... Great little diner ... Mawby's burger onions like the old days ... Best Caesar dressing in the city ... Everything real fresh and the service was excellent .. You like diners, you'll like this"}
{"text":"Living in another city, Jack had been looking for a restaurant for sale in Cleveland. One night, he narrowed his search to Chagrin Falls and he couldn't believe it. The hometown boy saw that Dinks, where he had eaten many times in his youth, was for sale.  He has opened his diner here and, in my opinion, it's a hit. Our group had soup, a Caesar salad, chili and an omelette with shredded hash browns. Simple fare, but well done. Soon to have a real, old fashioned soda fountain, North Main makes old fashioned phosphates, egg creams and chocolate malts. My 92 year old Mom was so excited to find a local place that served a chocolate malt as opposed to just a milkshake and she  loved it. It was thick and creamy. My husband had a strawberry shake that he thought outranked another nearby establishment's.  North Main is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is so nice to have another solid, casual place  open for dinner where you can show up in old duds and a baseball cap. We will definitely be back to try other offerings on the extensive menu and to support a hometown boy living his dream."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. The hamburgers were supposed to be identical to Mawby's back in the day, and were not even close. The onions were not as good and the hamburger was not as tasty.The fries were covered with cilantro and tyne, which made them uneditable. No Lowry's seasoned salt. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. So happy I stopped here. Food is incredible, and the price is even better. Good people come into this place, guest wise, and the experience is chill.  I can only assume people have silver spoons in their pockets, when they slam this place with a 1 star review."}
{"text":"Long wait at Yours Truly so we headed down the road a bit to North Main Diner. We were seated right away and our server was at our table for drinks in just a couple minutes. I ordered Corned Beef Hash, eggs and toast. The corned beef was pulled, not chipped. Delicious! Eggs cooked perfectly and toast was thick and tasted home made. My husband had avocado eggs. He loved the dish. Large amount of freshly scooped avocado under the eggs with the same great toast. His coffee and my iced tea were refilled many times and we had our bill on the table so we could check out at the back in our own time. We never felt rushed. The prices are very reasonable. We did not order, as it was breakfast, but they also make homemade milkshakes, malts and phosphates. A great breakfast find."}
{"text":"I went on an early Friday morning and was greeted by a lovely hostess. Definitely a local spot. Typical diner breakfast. As a Solon native I am biased to Jim's Open Kitchen but North Main was very good!"}
{"text":"It's hard to replace Dinks in Chagrin Falls but I think the newest incarnation might just have the formula.  This isn't just ordinary diner food.  It's top quality comfort food, using first class ingredients, very well prepared.  I had the corned beef sandwich which I was told was made in house, and was so tender that my teeth just slid through.  As a side, the fried brussel sprouts were almost as good as Michael Simon's place in Tremont.  In a town with so many first class high end places it's nice to see a first class family place arise from Dinks ashes."}
{"text":"Eat here for lunch often, strictly burgers, fries, corned beef, and the fish ain't bad. I've given them the benefit of the doubt and tried other dinners, they're just ok. Sticking with what I know from now on, maybe try breakfast, heard people saying it's good, as far as the rest of it goes, not taking any more chances. The older woman is a good waitress, but most of the young ones are so-so. If I'm paying for food I want as good as home not just marginal. Floor needs a good scrubbing, looks like they just hit it with a mop, the outside steps are getting bad."}
{"text":"The only reason we gave this one star is we have to.  Worst breakfast ever!  Let's start with trying to get the order right. First time we were there the ham and cheese omelet came without the ham and the food wasn't good. Next time we were there the order came with the wrong bread and no hash browns that came with the dish. Finally she brought a soggy English muffin and half raw hash browns. Then we were charged extra for the hash browns! The waitress asked if we wanted more coffee even though our cups weren't empty we said yes. Only to find out we were charged for \"fill ups\"! So 2 cups of coffee was $8!  The eggs tasted bad like they were not real!  No taste or flavor at all. Throwing bacon on top of a dish isn't flavor.  The owner should pay more attention to what's coming out of the kitchen than loudly socializing with customers!"}
{"text":"Time has a way of marching on, and job/family/address changes can make maintaining friendships a challenge.  I texted a friend I've not seen (in person) for several years, her answer was Yes!  Let's meet for breakfast.  Where?  My suggestion:  our regular old stomping grounds of Chagrin Falls, but new place (for us):  North Main Diner.  This morning being just a bit too chilly, we passed on the outdoor seating and went inside.  A hostess greeted us right away, suggested a couple of tables, but let me choose a different table to the side.  Our server came right over, took our beverage order and delivered coffee and water to us quickly.  The menu offerings are good old plain-Jane food, and our eggs over-easy, hash browns, and toast were fine.  I did notice that NMD offers phosphates and malts (not that I would have one for breakfast) - very cool;  you don't find these everywhere.  Our server placed our check on the table, but did not pressure us to feel like we needed to leave;  we lingered and talked for quite a while, and several times were offered refills for our coffee.  I meant to check (but forgot to) for wifi;  this is a place I would feel comfortable coming back to for morning coffee and working remotely, taking a mental break and sit to people-watch, or sit and read for a bit.  Parking in town is ample and free;  I may bring Waldo dog to town for a walk, and then sit outside and have a snack while he chills out under the table."}
{"text":"Sat us and forgot about us. We left without eating. If I ever actually eat the food I will update review, but this first experience with very poor service earns them 1 star for time being."}
{"text":"My family and I were very happy with the food and the service. I ordered my eggs over medium and they were cooked perfectly. My nephew orders the Italian omelette and said it was amazing. My mom had the blue berry pancakes and lived the blueberries on top but wished they were in the pancakes as well. Best the toast ever. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Lovely old school diner with great stuff and good food.  Enjoyed a meatloaf sandwich with fries and the sandwich was excellent!  The only \"complaint\" is the fries could be a little more crispy or so to say fried longer. However all together still a definite 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"This diner provided me with the worst food I've eaten out in a long time. The only reason it gets two stars is because the server was the kindest, most wonderful young lady ever.   My partner got a Ceasar salad, no anchovies, with chicken; I got one with salmon. We shared fries.   The food was not good, not even a little. I hate hate hate saying something like that. And I even tried to get down with it. I was very patient. It was after trying to find my way almost all the way through a salad and fries that my patience was finally defeated.   My partner's salad came with anchovies on it. A simple mistake, but it set the tone. The romaine was woody and bitter. Greens are the main feature of a Caesar and they just weren't there. The salmon was dry and miserable. The fries were cool and spongy. Literally nothing we ate was good. Moreover, it's a diner with bistro prices--too expensive.   I know what a greasy spoon diner is like. Greasy spoon diners can be really good This isn't that. This isn't a greasy spoon I mistakenly expected more from; it's just not good.   I'm really sorry to say. The setting is charming, but the food--basic menu items!--just isn't good. The server? Super great."}
{"text":"The line at Yours Truly was too long so we decided to come here.  It took 15 mins for the server to come over, another ten minutes for the drinks to arrive (one never came) and 30 minutes for our ice cold breakfast to arrive.  On top of that the breakfast was not good.  I want this place to succeed, but with terrible service and cold food, I fear they will be the next casualty in that location."}
{"text":"I'm just going to list all the things that went wrong with our brunch this morning.   1. Hair in my girlfriend's eggs. 2. Incorrect order for my friend. 3. My sausage wasn't cooked all the way. 4. Dime sized chunk of flower in my other friend's pancake. 5. The OWNER was cooking the food. 6. He wasn't wearing gloves. 7. None of the cooks were wearing gloves. 8. Most weren't wearing anything over their hair including the owner. 9. We split the bill and it was all wrong. 10. Waitress had really bad breath, like a rotting tooth kind of breath.  We will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. A nice place to sit down and enjoy a family style home cooked meal in the heart of chagrin falls."}
{"text":"Update on previous review... Decided to try this place again for breakfast. It will be my last visit. My friends and I all ordered the avocado eggs.  The avocados were hard and not ripe. Could barely finish it. Not good at all. The place lacks any kind of ambience.   Fluorescent light above our table kept flickering on and off... Seems like it's on a downward spiral."}
