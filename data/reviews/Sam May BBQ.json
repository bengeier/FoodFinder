{"text":"The people who run this place are so disrespectful, it's like they don't want customers to buy food from them. Tried ordering some bbq and the people didn't even bother looking at me. They still had bbq, so I don't understand their actions.  Tldr; just go to the place on the right; better service and probably better food."}
{"text":"Best Chinese BBQ pork in the GTA! And to the people complaining about service.. it's a Chinese food court! Get over it. You're not at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there last evening and ordered BBQ pork and roast pork on rice.  Paid in the $6.00 range.  What a terrible experience.  The BBQ pork was really bad.  They used a really cheap cut of pork that included chewy organ tubes right in the pork after it was cut and presented on top of the rice.  The marinade used for their BBQ pork is short on flavor and heavy on salt. The roast pork was not all that appetizing either.  I watched him pick up a leg part and was trying really hard to cut a little bit more of pork off the side of that leg before that becomes an ingredient soup for the next day that they give for free when you order a dish there.   Oh yes, saw a sign at the front, they added ginger scallion oil sauce for $0.50.  Completely outrageous.  Other BBQ take out restaurants have them in a big bowl with a spoon to help yourself.  First time ever seeing that.  Another turn off.   They way I see it, I got really odd pork parts for my BBQ pork and really dry roast pork from parts that I would not pay good money for.  They have a really long way to go to use better cuts of meat and a better recipe if they want to survive.  Good luck but for sure I will NEVER order anything from there and I don't suggest you do either.   For all you non-believers, please, try it out and you will understand this post. Happy eating!  :)"}
{"text":"I've known this place since they were at Brimley and Sheppard. Their BBQ is pretty good. That being said, they're on the pricey side.  My profile says to go to Chinese restaurants for the food, and not the service, but that quote (with its character limit), when elaborated, should be specified to say that one shouldn't expect outstanding, super friendly wait staff, as their goal is to be efficient, not super welcoming, but one should also not tolerate horrendous service. Now how does that relate to this place?  The owner and his wife have horrendous customer relation skills. The owner's wife, to my recollection, doesn't smile very much. She always seems upset. If I'm ordering, I'm not sure why you're so upset at me.   Other than the lack of smiling, I have two instances I would like to relay. Both have to do with roasted pork bones. I'm working on my tonkotsu recipe, and as such, need pork bones. I prefer mine roasted, so I'm constantly looking for a good Chinese BBQ place that will give/sell me good pork bones. I asked the owner's wife how much the bones were, and she told me $3. When I asked what specifically was $3, as there were a number of bones visible through the display window, she specified one pork leg bone. That's quite expensive. That, I have less of an issue with. I was going to buy one, but the owner walked out and told me that there were none left. They were most obviously there. I could see them. He just kept insisting that there were note, and in a none-too-friendly way.  The second instance was quite a bit worse. Elderly abuse? My grandfather also has a thing for making soup. He had already bought a $18 free run chicken, and while waiting for it to get chopped up, he asked how much the roasted pig head was. He was told $10. First, that's very expensive for a roasted pig head (Foody's are like $3.99. Second of all, the owner's wife not only told him it was $10, but that it was very expensive). Her tone made it sound like he should not be asking how much the head was because he could not afford it. In my family, my grandfather is the one who likes to spend lots of money on food. He can totally afford it. Even if this were not the case, to treat a customer who had already bought something like that is ridiculous.  If I'm in the food court here, I undoubtedly will come here again if I want BBQ, but I feel like everyone should be warned about the service. Bring tissues. You might just end up in tears."}
{"text":"So far they are not bad, the bbq meat look really nice and delicious.   I got a ??? noodles r so broken up...  makes me feel like they r scraps... some noodle have a hard center so I feel like the noodles weren't cooked together.  Half the meat that was given was just \"fat\".   BBQ pork was okay but it was not amazing,   Their free soup that comes with the rice was so High in Sodium that a sip of it made me gulp my cup of water.   If I had a choice I don't want to give any stars to this place at all!!! \"0 star\""}
{"text":"The BBQ pork is very so-so. I've been there twice and each time their BBQ pork is mostly burnt on the outside.    They are situated in a food court inside a very quiet plaza that doesn't have much else going on other than some dodgy stores. Not sure how they can sustain with so-so food and poor customer service.  I ordered a BBQ pork rice and I asked them nicely to add a bit of the 'ginger-scallion' to be added to the rice. The woman had the guts to say I need to pay $.50 for that. When I complained, she yelled back and said that if I want to eat, I need to pay. Omg! Never been to a place with such disrespect for their customers. I was ready to throw the rice back at her face. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Bad services!!! The whole family looks angry all the time.  They don't even bother talking to you if you ask them something.  They also won't let you choose which duck or pork that you want.  They just give you whatever they want.  This place is also very expensive."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best place in Toronto for Chinese BBQ, specifically for roast duck and pork. Located in a busy food court of a Chinese plaza, it's not somewhere I'd recommend if you're looking for atmosphere or, even, good service. My 4-star rating is based simply on food, and price. If you're looking for quality Chinese BBQ, this would be the place :)"}
{"text":"This is the worst BBQ place in all of Toronto and I mean it when I say that. I've tried a handful of Chinese BBQ shops and this is by far the worst. Even supermarket BBQ is better than this place! I've tried this place before and was not impressed but after this time, I will never in my lifetime come back again. We came to the food court at around 2 and it wasn't very busy. We walked up to the counter and the person seemed to be on lunch so we walked to the store next door and back over to take a look at the selection they had giving them time to arrange for someone else to serve us. About 5 minutes, later we walked up to the front and looked at the person sitting eating and he gave us a look like we were an inconvenience to him. So we said you finish and we will come back. Was there no one else working? I'm sure there was more than one person on duty as I always see a cashier and man cutting up the meat. He got up looking pissed and said what do you want. Since he already got up, we ordered 1lbs pork and he quickly chopped it up and charged us $7. When we got home, there were about 10 tiny pcs and the skin was rock hard that you couldn't even bite into it or your teeth would chip. We had to throw it out because it was not edible at all. It was absolutely garbage what he gave us and we paid $7 for it! I don't know if he was pissed we came during his break so he served us with crap or what, but he should've called for someone to attend to customers or put up a sign saying not serving at this time. He was one rude man. Avoid this place at all costs! Save your money and go elsewhere because their food is absolutely garbage, I'm not even kidding! You can find much better BBQ across the street."}
{"text":"TL; DR: Oil and sodium  Stumbled upon this place for dinner unfortunately. We were hungry and thought \"how bad could it be for this hole in the wall?\" Well, not all holes-in-the-wall are hidden gems, case in point, Sam May BBQ. I got the two-BBQ on rice; I picked BBQ duck and roast pig for $7.75+tax. The whole dish was just thrown together clumsily. The chef was more focused on talking to a patron and the lady beside him and was just hacking away at the food. He passed the dish off to the lady and she threw some napa cabbage on with a bit of sauce (which added only moisture to the rice as it was pretty bland). It came with a lean-meat soup and cold soy milk (the take-out cup being 3/4 full). The duck was pretty oily and not tender. It wasn't tough to chew, but it wasn't melt-in-your-mouth either. The flavours  are fine, but the oil covered it up. The roast pork was hugely disappointing. The skin was not crisp even though we ate there and you only get a small sliver per piece of meat. The rice was cooked properly, but the sauce added minimal value to the dish. The soup was incredibly oily; I couldn't finish it and had to throw it out. I woke up the next day with pretty bad cotton-mouth so they must've used a lot of MSG in the food, I didn't consume anything else that night either.  Overall, it was a disappointing experience despite having 0 expectations and I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I wonder if this Sam May related to this Sam May http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sam-may-chinese-bbq-food-scarborough?   Located in the same food court as the famous and busiest HK style food joint Great Fountain http://www.yelp.ca/biz/great-well-fast-food-scarborough#query:great%20fountain, the competition for price and value is fierce!   $3.99 can get you either a Roasted Pork or Soya Sauce Chicken with rice, soup of the day and a soy drink.. now that's what I call cheap!! Ultra Cheap for cheapo like me?   But since tonight is Saturday, I decide to splurge and treat myself to:  Roasted Duck and BBQ Pork ($5.25)  - a wholesome meal with protein, vegetables, grains, tofu..  - Chinese soup: preserved vegetable with pork  - A healthy soy drink that good to clench your thirst from all the salty food!  - roasted duck was on the skinny side, hardly any meat..  - BBQ pork was not bad.. has a good mix of lean and fatty part  - Rice was dry and soaked in the sweet soya sauce   I gave Sam May at Glen Watford a 3 star as it is a lot cleaner than the other location and the staff is a lot nicer..   And the soy drink is a nice touch... I love soy drink! :)"}
{"text":"I've been to better Chinese BBQ places, but this one is not bad for a quick eat. Pricing is fair. They can get quite busy during lunch hours.   Service is meh, but it's an Asian food court, so..."}
{"text":"This place is located in a very packed food court... lots of competition.  They are always a great fall back place to eat at.   Generally the food is quite delicious here..not the best duck in the city but its your typical chinese bbq place.  Price is good.. i would say next to great fountain this place would probably make the most money in this food court.    I would go back here, sometimes they have cheap deals .. i got a bbq chicken leg on rice, soya milk and a soup for 5 dollars flat... cant beat that anywhere.  Good Value"}
