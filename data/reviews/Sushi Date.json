{"text":"Best sushi place in Bolton.  The decor etc is nothing to write home about, but the food is good, take out available, and all you can eat on dine in."}
{"text":"This place needs to be cleaned from top to bottom. It's filthy, to the point where you wonder how they got a green pass from public health. Needs major upgrades to decor. Ripped chairs, stained banquettes, dirty carpets. We gave this place a try because it got good reviews on local Facebook page, not sure why. Food was at best so-so. Sushi rolls completely packed with filler fried crumbs, gross. Lost appetite half way through, when noticed the floors sushi chefs were working on were covered in food sludge. Eating there, is \"dirt\" cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for. My husband had major stomach issues after. Not understanding the 4 or 5 star reviews, have people not ever had sushi before? This is not the way it's supposed to be...Want good all you can eat, make the drive to Hama Sushi on Major Mac. Your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"Been a sushi date lover for the past few years. The selection is ample and the food is prepared beautifully.  One of my favourite all you can eat sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Horrible, terrible customer service. The servers are very RUDE. They charged us for maki rolls that were half eaten (I ate the inside but left some of the outside), claiming that it was \"wasted food\". They are THIEVES!!!! The people sitting in the table next to us were in complete disbelief, they even encouraged us to not pay the portion of the bill that they added. The food wasn't even that great and the servers don't speak a lick of English. STAY FAR AWAY!!!! I would give it 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place has been open for several years, which is impressive for the area. It seems to be difficult for new places to stay open for more than a couple of years in this area. I have been here a couple of times, and the food is alright.    The eating area is large, an there are plenty of tables. It's good for small groups and large.   The food is pretty good, but it's not amazing. The service is not amazing either. They take a really long time to bring your food out, and when they do bring out your rolls, the rice sticks together, a sign that they've been sitting for a while. The restaurant has never been packed when is gone, so I don't see why my rolls should be sitting there.   Otherwise, is a nice little place to eat. The order forms are very simple to understand and well organized. And the place has a nice atmosphere. It's one of the better sushi places in the immediate area."}
{"text":"If you're looking for typical sushi and you're in Bolton, the food fares well for what it is.  With that being said, I am not a fan of their service at all. Inconsistant portion sizes and long wait times in between the next order. One time we had our server come back and take the food from our table to give to someone else  because the order was incorrect!  Imagine how many other times that might have happened...Explains the missing rolls we ordered."}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea why the average sushi date rating is a \"3\". That's just uncalled for in my opinion. Sushi date was the original sushi place that opened my eyes to the delicious world of sushi. I'm from the US and have enjoyed sushi while living all across the country and being in Canada. Sushi Date remains my favorite. Not only is the sushi on point but it's all you can eat. The staff is friendly and you always feel like you've left having got more than your money's worth. Sidenote: I'm a advocate of vegetarian sushi, people love to hate on that, so let them hate. Sushi dates vegetarian sushi is to die for from the mango to the sweet potato (especially the sweet potato) you'll never find better vegetarian sushi. I'm so happy that sushi date has survived the many turned over businesses in Bolton because it's too good not to be there!"}
{"text":"Great sushi joint... I'm new to the area and its nice to have a great sushi experience so close to home... On the weekends, I recommend to make a reservation especially if you have a big group. The food is fresh and delicious... I'm going back for sure..."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to be working in Bolton around the time the Sushi date first opened its doors. As many of you know most sushi places (especially those of the AYCE variety) have a performance cycle similar to that of a helium balloon with a slow leak (starts high but gradually decreases over time) and sushi date is no exception.  Now I will say that they patched that slow leak prior to any kind of disaster BUT what you get today is nothing to what I once dined on back in early 2009. Plus I am just a little bit of Sushi snob (I've eaten it in Vancouver FYI) LOL  **Side note imagine if I really was that much of a jerk :) - Not at allm I'm Italian folks I'll eat anything...twice!**  I certainly don't want to give the impression that Sushi date is in anyway shape or form a poor performer. Au contraire mon frere! On the AYCE playing field SD does really well, and its prices and quality make it the BEST sushi joint in all of Caledon, dare I say a top 25 performer in Peel?  The staff here is amazingly friendly, some of the best and brightest smiling around. They are attentive and regularly go the extra mile for every customer. Your green tea never gets cold or low and the food service comes out of the kitchen at top speed, with your first plates coming out within minutes.  Some of my favorite menu items are:  - Appetizers: Sweet potato and Shrimp Tempura, Edamame, Seaweed Salad, Miso Soup - Sashimi (all of it) - Sushi: Spicy Salmon, Spicy Tuna, Sushi Pizza, Tobiko - Roll&Hand Roll: Green/Red Dragon Roll, Dynamite Roll, Spider Roll, Spicy Salmon/Tuna Hand rolls - Desert: Deep Fried Banana  I do agree with the other reviewers - if you are in the area I would recommend giving SD a try.At $12.99 for lunch, $18.99 for dinner (Mon-Thurs) AND $20.99 (on weekends) Sushi Date is always a great deal."}
{"text":"Very over priced and they will charge you for every last piece of sushi you cant eat. Terrible service it takes hours to get your food and then half the order doesnt come. At that point dont order more because they will probably show up with the rest of your order 30 minutes later and argue with you if you say you dont want it anymore. They will definitely be rude to you and it is grossly dirty in this place."}
{"text":"The sashimi is really good. Better than I've had in a long time at AYCE sushi.  Service wasn't great, but the place was quite busy (dinner on a Thursday)  Highly recommend, will come here again."}
{"text":"Came here based on a review from yelp, I have to say being from Florida I'm very particular about sushi but I have to say what I had was very good. For Canadian sushi I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"\"Out-of-a-can\" restaurant, disappointing -- $25/pp, the quality and freshness is lacking, haphazard creations of maki sushi, with over cooked scallops and plastic textured shrimp. I was robbed paying for this!"}
{"text":"It's so dirty and gross here. I'm sorry like it's okay it's just so dirty. My friend found toe nails in there sushi. And there always hair in it. My boyfriend last night found plastic and than showed the manager and he left for like 20 mins and he's like u get 10% off ! Like ok thanks ? It's always dirty. I've heard rumours here forever. It's gross."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Rolls had mayo in it! Had to wait forever. Presentation was average. Ambience lacking something.... in general 4 out of 10. Will not come back."}
{"text":"I was a very faithful customer to sushi date. Their food is great and normally the service is pretty fast, unless you're there at lunch. The furniture and decor is nice and they have soothing music playing. Their staff is almost always friendly, but I can hardly call them helpful.   The last time I went to Sushi Date, they had a new waitress working who was very hard to understand, was rude to me when I asked her to repeat herself and who was taking forever to bring out our food during dinner hours. I was very upset with this service, and when I approached the two men at the desk about the situation, I kid you not, they both LAUGHED at me and proceeded to speak in their language.   I haven't been back since and will NOT go back again. There's a much better alternative in Bolton and they have excellent customer service there."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sushi Date in Bolton almost weekly for 3 years.  My work mates love the all-you-can-eat menu... especially on Fridays when sashimi is included!  The staff are very friendly and service is excellent.  The food has been consistently impressive.  Its a pretty typical sushi menu - fried rice, spring rolls and teriyaki chicken/salmon included!  Their shrimp tempura is huge and their spicy udon soup is a favourite.  We just destroy the menu every time we go!  If you happen to be in Bolton and are hungry - this is your ticket!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice when I'm in that area. My usual go to place is New Generation Sushi in Vaughan which still has the freshest sushi and taste for me.  Sushi Date was better than I expected it to be though. Salmon sashimi tasted good and pretty fresh.  All the other items we ordered all tasted great, nothing to complain about.  Service is great and the food comes quickly like others have mentioned. Reasonable price too compared to other places."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I've been too. I don't eat much sushi though, the only one I get is dynamite and that one is anaZing. However, when I go here I get everything else they have to offer. From their cheese wontons to beef/chicken teriyaki- everything is done quickly and good. Best part is their fried bananas with ice cream  yum yum best place I've been too so far."}
{"text":"I went last night.  I have to say.. Its pretty pathetic.   The best part was the sashimi was cut very nicely although a touch thin but its always  better to be to thin than too thick.   The sushi was extremely rice up.  I had the sushi pizza too and I swear it was as thick as a hockey puck. Pretty gross.   It just looks like they're not bothering to try here.  The price is no worth it.  Its really not worth more than a 14.99 AYCE"}
{"text":"This is probaly the worst place to get all you can eat sushi. The place is dirty and gross customer service is terrible and the fish is old or frozen. I ordered the sirloin steak from the all you can eat dinner menu and found a piece of plastic in it. I was given 10 percent off on my bill. That shows you how cheap and how  little they care about their customers."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sushi Date in Bolton for several years.  The service is fast, friendly, attentive and food comes quickly, at the right temperature (or too hot), and always tasty.  Sushi Date is an All-You-Can-Eat sushi restaurant and on Fridays the special is sashimi, which is a great deal.  You would regularly pay approximately $1 for a piece of sashimi at any other restaurant, but on Fridays you can get as much as you want! Mind you, too much of anything is not good, but is it the same if it's only once a week?...hm...  Most favourite thing in the menu is the Dymanite Roll.  Other tasty things in the menu are the calamari, salmon teriyaki, and the Phili roll (if you like cream cheese though...).  Things to remember:  You should not order the same amount of food when you go here with 6 people as when you go with 2 people. Say no to refills of green tea if you don't like your tea super hot. Service is so good that they come around often filling up your cup.  That's right!  Pops and green tea are included in the all-you-can-eat menu, as well as dessert.  Great place, great atmosphere, very open and well lit, with a fish tank in the center...hm...(isn't that some sort of animal cruelty?)..."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The decor of the restaurant is typical of an all you can eat place, nothing fancy. We went on a Monday night and the place was packed, so we figured this must be good. The service overall was very slow, took a good couple of minutes for someone to acknowledge us at the door.  We didn't want to do the all you can eat, so we ordered off the a la carte menu. It took a while before someone even took our order. We got sushi and miso soup.... Except the soup came 5 minutes after the sushi. The sushi itself was on, nothing out of the ordinary but not bad. There is lots of parking, and the restaurant is very easy to get to."}
{"text":"It was our first visit and we were hesitant based on the reviews, despite that we decided to try this All You Can Eat Sushi joint.  What a HUGE mistake.  To set the stage, my GF and I are well versed Sushi eaters but are not Sushi snobs. The restaurant had about 3 other small tables.  We were quickly seated by a very non greeting and quiet waitress. We ordered our first round of food and it came quick. We requested Tamari (GF soya sauce) and where informed that the didn't have any!  The sashimi was far from fresh and choices were limited to 9 including the \"fake crab\". We finished our dish and had to ask for another order sheet. Our next round arrived being served by the same initial waitress. Our dishes were slid on the table edge as she flew by. No explanation or title of dish. It reminded me of a draft beer sliding down the bar like in a cowboy movie.   Our subsequent dishes were served in similar manner.  Our salad arrived and we were unsure about the dressing ingredients. We asked our server what the ingredients were. She said she didn't know and walked away. Eventually another server came over and we muddle through most ingredients.  MOST, GF found item toxic to her diet. None of the severs took time to ask kitchen staff after we asked them. Could had food allergy emergency.  DO NOT RECOMMEND. Piss poor!!"}
