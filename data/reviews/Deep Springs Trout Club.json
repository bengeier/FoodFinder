{"text":"Best place in town, hands down.  How can Murry R even be allowed to write a review when she has never eaten there.  Also they take reservations, it is good for kids, you can bring your own wine or liquor, the fish is as fresh as possible since they are on site alive.  I am glad this is private as thru can most always accommodate.  There is no better, fresher, home made food around.  If I could give it 10 stars I would."}
{"text":"I visited Deep Springs as a guest of a friend who's a member. The area was beautiful and relaxing. Very well maintained and just full of a Norman Rockwell charm. We all caught some trout and the staff cooked it for us. The staff was ALL very attentive, cheerful and professional. The grounds were perfectly maintained.. They even sell spring water right from the tap! Our meals were great. In fact, I was told by my host that I could actually have half of my trout prepared one way and the other half, yet another way.... Both were awesome. What a great find... I'll be back."}
{"text":"This seems like a really nice place, until you go in and try to get a seat for a meal with your family, and are rejected because you're not a member. You'd think that they would let you know before you get out and walk in that it's members only. But you don't find that out until you walk in and then and they say, sorry this is for members only."}
{"text":"We just had dinner here tonight. We are new members and enjoyed a lovely dinner with current members. The pan fried Trout is amazing, having been swimming in the stream just minutes before.   The dining is old world camp/clubby, and rustic and elegant at the same time. The menu is extensive  and they offer many selections other than Trout.  The grounds are spectacular and everyone staff and owner are charming and very welcoming.  Bravo for a fantastic dinner; the first of many to come!"}
{"text":"Rude, German woman works here and is BEYOND nasty if you don't somehow know this place is for members only. We were hardly out of our car for a minute and she walked over and very rudely told us to leave. I've told everyone I know to avoid this place - I can be nasty too. In the day and age of Yelp and online reviews, you better get your staff in line over there. NOTE: you will also see another review on here that basically says the same thing. Seems like you got a problem."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with well priced fresh spring water.  Easy drive along a country road. Pay attention though or you may miss your turn!  I have not tried the restaurant and I don't fish so no comments on that."}
{"text":"Deep Springs is probably one of my favorite places to visit. Nothing beats the tranquil scenery on a warm summer day..and a visit with the pet goats.  I've been coming here since I was a teenager and I can't wait until they open every spring. Pan-fried trout is always delicious and fresh but the ribs and steaks are also amazing. The tomato salad with creamy dressing or the cucumber salad are the perfect start to the meal. For sides I love the pan-fried potatoes but season veggies are a must try.  Tom and his family are so warm and welcoming, the Trout Club feels like a second home!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten here. But as a child i came here most weekends during the summer to fill up gallons of fresh spring water. This was so popular before the advent of bottled water, that sometimes there would be a line of up to a half dozen cars waiting to fill up. Keep in mind, this was just a couple of faucets in the space of a garden patio. I guess you can fish there, too, but you need to be a member. The going price was 20 cents a gallon. Beats that 60 plus cents we pay at the store now. And this stuff was certified real deal spring water, not reverse osmosis toilet water.  And it's in Chardon, not Willoughby."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding, everything is made fresh and I'd highly recommend any of the fish at anytime, especially the pan fried perch or trout.  The sweet tea is also probably the best i've ever had from anywhere, I swear the must put drugs in it or something.  My only real knock is the prices, everything is ridiculously expensive and generally I don't complain about it since the food is always good, but it doesn't have any of the makings of a very nice restaurant except for the food to justify the high price.  The natural scenery is nice but the wrought iron tables and chairs to the patio enclosed dining area can't justify a dinner in the same price range as an elite gourmet restaurant.  That's the only thing keep it from 5 stars."}
