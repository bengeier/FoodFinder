{"text":"Great traditional, sloppy, tasty Drive-In Burgers, and a kick a** Greek salad as well. The owner is super friendly and the staff as well, they make you feel like a welcome regular after only a couple visits. Great place to go on the way to the beach, or grab a big bite coming back from a summer evening motorbike ride! Needs more picnic tables. This place is hopping in fair weather."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers, friendly staff, what can I say - they are amazing. By far the best burger place I've been to so far in Pickering. And considering the quality and quantity of food you get from them, the prices are great too. I must admit it's also immensely entertaining to watch them cook their delicious burgers, with a huge grill with open flames. A must go place for anyone looking for a great burger. They have several other dishes available as well, but I haven't tried any yet as the burger is too enticing to pass on."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a while. Fresh patties not frozen. Great onion rings and steak. Huge poutine. Awesome staff."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine. I am obsessed. Perfectly cooked, fresh French fries.
The veggie burger is actually really great too. 
I can't comment on the beef burgers as I did not try one, but this place is worth a try for the poutine alone. 
If you're in Pickering and like burger joints, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite burger places. lots of options and variations to top your burger or steak sandwich. The food is great, reasonably priced but the thing that sets them apart from others is their personal touch to customer service. If you love great beef its defiantly the place!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try the legendary Big M in Pickering. All I have to say is get the Steak On A Kaiser. You will not be disappointed. Got mine done Medium single order. Small staff of people on a weekday but I can imagine it being busy weekends especially summer near the beach. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for lite, heart-healthy fare then look elsewhere.This Pickering landmark is the place for great home style burgers and onion rings. The service is fast and friendly and it's just a kilometer north of one the best public beaches east of Toronto. Grab a burger and onion rings and then walk it off on the beach."}
{"text":"Same friendly service but our last few times have been disappointing. The burgers do not taste as fresh as they used to. I do still love their freshly made Milkshakes and Onion Rings."}
{"text":"The burgers here are really good. Reminds me of the burgers from my childhood in Chatham which I was no longer able to find in the GTA.

The burger is large and topping selections are not overly complicated.

If you want a good burger check this place out."}
{"text":"Went to the Big M with my wife and the food was excellent, the steak on a kaiser was excellent"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Haven't been here in a while but my return was just as hospitable as the previous visit.  Everyone who works here are all very friendly.  Feels like you're in their home and their main priority is to make you comfortable and of course, full with their delicious food.

If you have a big appetite and are craving a burger, then just get a regular sized burger.  Their junior burgers, however, are also pretty average sized.  I absolutely LOVE their banquet burger because BACON. Their very generous with their bacon and it's not our typical packaged bacon either.  I also recommend adding some of their forty-creek bbq sauce with some added flavour, not that it's much needed.  5/5.

Poutine - If ever you upgrade your combo to have a poutine instead, you'll be getting a huge serving of poutine which can be shared with at least one other person.  Best part is that they use curds and their gravy is also delicious.  Gotta love that squeaky cheese.  5/5.

Sweet Potato Fries - Another upgrade option and I must say that their sweet potato fries is the best I've ever had.  If you've ever tried to make sweet potato fries, it's not very easy to get that crispiness.  Theirs is absolute perfection.  And with their chipotle mayo?! Woowee! 5/5.

Onion Rings - Their rings too are huge.  As doughy as the batter is, it's not overly greasy.  I personally prefer the light crispier batter but theirs is still pretty good.  4/5."}
{"text":"Decent burger,  would be better if it were home made, large portions! Onion rings are beer battered so not my favorite. Chipotle mayo for sweet potato fries is good on everything.  A bit pricey."}
{"text":"Love there food especially the steak on  a Kaiser. Staff is always friendly and welcoming"}
{"text":"The food is good but it is a little costly! We come down here once in awhile! The cost keeps going up but our wages don't!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers around, big and nicely seasoned, perfect bun.  Their steak sandwich is also really good along with fries.  My only issue is the $10.99 for a burger combo.  I have this issue with all burger joints, their prices along with every other burger joint I know have skyrocketed since places like Burgers priest, holy chucks etc. have popped up.  I guess they figure if those places can get away with charging$15 bucks for a combo, why not charge at least ten.  But they taste so damn good so I'm forced to pay that ridiculous price!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner.

There was a line outside, and I can see why.   I ordered a Canadian burger combo (peameal bacon and cheese) , with half fries half onion rings and a drink.  ~$17.     Well worth it, 2 hrs later I'm still so full.    Fries are really good here, crisp and tasty.   Onion rings the batter is heavy but seasoned well.   

The burger was delicious.  7 ounces of deliciousness.    Great flavour and juicy.   

Staff here is amazing.  You will get great service here.   They hussle and make sure you get things quick.  Line moves fairly quickly.   

Don't be fooled by how the outside of this place looks, it is a hidden gem of Pickering.    

Would definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"What an unbelievable night.  Big M was hosting Jeep night, so not only was their some great food and awesome milkshakes but tons and tons of Jeeps,  Now that is the perfect recipe for a great night out."}
{"text":"The wife and went to this place.  Big M is one of those places that you drive by and wonder what all those people are lining up for.  

Well tonight we wonder no more.  I ordered the double burger, onion rings and chocolate milkshake. 

The onion rings were think cut and generously covered in batter.  This may not be to all tastes but with a dash of salt and some ketchup they are a small meal all their own.  

The milkshake was on par with Mr Greenjeans - a legend in the Toronto Eaton's Centre.  Excellent milkshake with one rider.  I would suggest you stop by McDonalds or Wendy's and grab a straw.  The shake is think and a little too much for a fountain drink pop. 

The burger cooked to perfection and dressed the way you want. A fair assortment of toppings and dressings. But the bun was superior.  A decent burger can be wrecked by a cheap bun.  This bun was designed to handle a 1/2 of beef.  Excellent burger and better than Five Guys in taste and price. 

Will be back but now I need to run off this burger feast.  Wow!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, friendly staff. Small inside but definitely worth it! I've seen this place for years and finally decided to try it... and I'm glad we did. 

Portions are large (great!) and there's something for everyone. My daughter loved the junior burger. Also tried the steak on a bun and while the meat was a tad tough the taste was great. 

My biggest problem? Deciding what to order on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I definitely like this place

First it has the 50's style diner which is definitely nostalgic

The burgers definitely hit the spot

My fav is the Big M burger but I don't mind the banquet burger as well

Combo is always the way go

Milkshakea are super yummy

Thick as well too

Staff are super friendly and make you feel at home

Has been a staple in the Pickering community

Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Often have the greek chicken salad and overloaded poutine! Great work guys"}
{"text":"As I was going to pickering Lakefront in I happened a pond a gold mine the burgers are so good makes my mouth water dnag son. the Meat paddy was the right size for the bread the fries were just right in  crispyness dat stuff was on point  also the ppl that work there hella nice would love to go there more often 



thank you you guys for the good food"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Pickering!! They have their special BBQ sauce ( 40 creek ) I highly suggest you put that on your burger while it's grilling! Great staff, awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"HUGE portions!! Bring an appetite!! Big M's never disappoints. Their burgers are the best, fries are okay. The place is always busy though! So make sure you make time to wait in line!"}
{"text":"As far as drive-ins go, this is about the best.

The Big M was originally opened by Ted The Big Macedonian (with some huge long Greek name I can't remember) across from its current location, and reinvigorated by his son Chris, who built the new place.

The menu is pretty much standard fare - burgers, hot dogs, variations thereof, and the sort of signature steak on a kaiser sandwich. They also have, as you'd expect, some pretty fine milkshakes.

The Big M hosts the All Canadian Riders Club Bike Night on Thursdays, so there's usually bikers hanging around, showing off their machines a little, and generally just having a good time, but any time the weather's good you'll find this place busy, and Chris working the register hollering out orders. He's a great guy, loves what he does, has a good time doing it, and manages to support some charities while doing it. That, to me, is what makes a place great."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review of this place until now? I live just up the road and I've been here several times. Big M has been around since 1965, serving up good no-nonsense burgers, steak sandwiches, souvlaki, shakes, and many other favourites.

For me, the thing that makes their burgers special is, they don't try to make into something else. It's just a burger, a good beef patty and your choice of toppings. It's the KISS principle - Keep It Simple, Stupid.

These burgers are better than any of the \"higher end\" (more expensive) burgers within miles. They've been doing it right for over 50 years! No need to change anything."}
{"text":"Huge portions and friendly staff. There's nothing better than a huge burger and fresh cut fries. I've heard so much about this place since moving to pickering and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Seating is limited to a few bar stools. More of a take-out place. The service is super friendly and has the feeling of going to a a buddies house for grilled burgers. The place was really busy and everything is made fresh to order so had to wait about 10 minutes for my order to be prepared.

Thank you Irene A. for posting your picture of the fish on a bun with sweet potato fries. This is exactly what I got after seeing the photo. I was dreaming about it all week long.

The fish on a bun was a good size. The sesame bun was nice and soft and the fish itself was moist with a nice crispy crunch on the outside. ($4.95)

The sweet potato fries were excellent. Big portion of fries and chipotle dipping sauce. I hate when I run out of sauce but they gave more than enough. The chipotle sauce really stood out for me and I would say one of the best I have had. Some places don't even provide Chipotle sauce and give you ketchup and thats just wrong. ($5.99)"}
{"text":"There's always a line up every time I go because the food is so good. Good burgers, Poutine and good customer service."}
{"text":"Good food, I had fish on a kiser with sweet potato fries and my husband had a banquet burger with onion rings, my daughter had a kids burger. Everything was tasty and fast service, very pricy for a fast food joint but the food was hood so it was worth it. I'll go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Excellent customer service. Friendly staff. What more can you ask for? Pricier than McDonald's but worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and very friendly staff. Every time I go in my food is fresh and my order is always correct - try the milkshakes they're awesome. Very reasonably priced for the great quality."}
{"text":"Went into Big Ms tonight and the service was amazing even though it was super busy being the dinner hour. Food was great! Good French fries, milkshakes and the chicken was so tender."}
{"text":"Many friends in the area have suggested that I check it out and I'm happy I did. I've visited twice and have had the banquet burger both time. It's their burger with cheese and bacon. On one occasion I got poutine for a side, which was good (not out of this world). For my second visit, I got onion rings. I would definitely suggest the onion rings for your side. I've also tried the hot dog with cheese and bacon. Good food, good price, friendly service and clean store. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Awesome Customer service and some really good made to order delicious burgers. Their steak sandwich is really good to and this place is close to my families house which makes it really convenient whenever I am in town visiting. If you are in Pickering and want a great burger definitely go."}
