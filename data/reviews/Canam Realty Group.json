{"text":"They are a full service realty team, unless you are on the other side of the table. Then they will make sure to do as little as possible. They have too many hands in the cookie jar, as it were, and they make it hard to communicate when they have so many people working on one transaction. They could care less about the impression they leave. Find another realtor who actually cares about their reputation and the people they work for."}
{"text":"My wife and I asked the real estate agent we use to find a rental house for us. She found a house listed by CANAM Realty Group. We liked the house and the lease was signed in just a few days. We stayed there for 12 months while we searched for a house to purchase. Monica at CANAM was very attentive during contract signing and any incident that occurred during our stay. CANAM was responsible for the swimming pool and each week a pool man was there to check the chemicals and keep the pool water sparkling. I am sure that it is difficult to be the liaison between the owner and the tenants, but CANAM was very fair in all circumstances. Our experience with Monica and CANAM was extremely positive."}
{"text":"Canam experience was exceptional!  I understand it can be complicated trying to find win / win situations to balance the needs of the owners and the tenants as I personally have been in both roles.  Monica and her team were wonderful to work with and they seem to balance that very well.  When a repair was needed they were responsive, and also very VERY nice!  I was actually assisting my father who had terminal cancer and I worked with Canam throughout the lease for him.  I also worked to close out the lease early after he passed and they executed the terms fairly.  I will recommend them to ANYONE I engage who is looking for a home."}
{"text":"My wife and I were relocating here for work, and had a very short amount of time to find a place to rent that would accommodate our two golden retrievers.  We came across a house that accepted our dogs, and went ahead and signed the lease. Everything started out fine - nice enough contacts in the office, a timely, thorough inspection/walk-through, etc.

Overall, the house satisfied our needs until we got settled in the area and purchased a home.  What was lacking was the overall property management/tenant relationship aspect of the management company.  I wholeheartedly understand that the property we rented was far from their only rental property they supported, but from beginning-to-end, they seemed like they were more worried about keeping their landlord happy, than the tenants that were responsible for paying their commission.  Additionally, contracting your work out (i.e. pool service, cleaning team) to the right people goes a long way in showing that you care about your personal/company image, and with the contractors that we had experience with, it just seemed like they either knew the people, or were trying to save as much money as possible.

During the walk-through, we noticed how filthy the place was (dirty shelving, fixtures, floors, etc.), after having \"just been cleaned\" by Canam's \"professional\" cleaners.  The rep from Canam said that he'd get it taken care of and cleaned again - great.  The cleaning team came again and, not knowing my wife majored in Spanish in college, were berating us and saying (and I'm paraphrasing) that we purposely made the house dirty before they came.  Completely unprofessional.  Additionally, when we received our deposit back after moving out, we noticed how professionally they angled the \"before\" and \"after\" pictures (i.e. the \"before\" picture of a railing is zoomed in whatsoever, but the \"after\" picture zooms in on a surface scratch on some piece of the railing (along with a $250 charge to fix it, when I would have gladly went over and touched it up with paint)). It's also pretty convenient that they own the Foothills Renovations, LLC that did the work on the house after our move.  I'm sure they don't inflate pricing at all (see rail example above).  I would have considered the railing issue \"normal wear\", but what do I know?  I'm not a landlord.

Everything was going fine for the next month or so, until the dryer went out.  It never worked quite right, and when it went out, Canam disclosed that they would not be replacing it.  Thusly, we had to go out and buy a new washer/dryer to replace the 20 year old units that were \"conveniently\" in the house.  I'd like to preface this by saying that this could be a blind accusation, but it just seems rather convenient that these things would neither be mentioned in the rental listing nor their condition disclosed prior to signing of the lease (even though we had to initial a line saying we understood they were \"convenience items\"), considering the dilapidated condition that they were in.

Like I previously mentioned, the house served its purpose, but this review is solely based on our experience with the management company.  They seem to have the ability to be good at what they do - it just seems like the \"want to\" just isn't there.

Side note:  The review below mine on Google, by Matthew Remus, violates Google's review policy.  Matthew Remus works for RedStone Mortgage, which is in the same office as Canam.  I saw his card on the front desk when I was dropping off keys."}
