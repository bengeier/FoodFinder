{"text":"Felt like I was near the beach in Mexico. Good food, Mexican music, cold beer, great seafood and even mariachi's!  Services was a little erratic but they are pleasant. I will go again."}
{"text":"Best place to eat seafood.. and the best Micheladas!!!  Love this place!!! I always order out,  and I decided to eat in today. I don't regret it at all!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the mega dish!  I can't describe it but included fried whole fish, fried fillet of fish octopus oysters on the half shelf with ceviche topping and 3-4 different varieties of shrimp.  My brother also ordered a carne asada burrito and loved it!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing Scallop Ceviche. Love the interpretation of Paiella. Friendly service. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I was on the internet looking for restaurants that serve Mexican food for a quick Monday dinner and was attracted to El Pacifico because it serves fresh seafood and offered  a discount coupon.  The experience was so authentic it was like visiting Mexico again with the simple surroundings, lack of pretensions, and very tasty fresh food.  We found the combination of food, price, and service was a great value and instantly began to plan another visit.  So if you're tired of the standard offerings at popular Mexican restaurants in Phenix come here and get back to the real thing."}
{"text":"Super delicious Mexican seafood, happy hour oysters are the best and an awesome deal, service takes a bit but overall I will be back! Can't beat the margaritas either!"}
{"text":"OMG; they were right in prev reviews; it is going to a small Mexican beach restaurant. I cant believe we got a dozen oysters on the half shell for only $10.  Of course, we were lucky we went on a Friday, during their happy hour time; First visit, not the last for sure.  Everything we ordered was delicious.  And, the free cup of soup, called the 7 seafood soup was great!!! Do try the shrimp tacos , as Hubby loved them,, and he is not a big tortilla fan. I want to try other  items, so we will be returning;  The prices are very reasonable, and the staff who served us was great. And, of course, I ended my meal with the Fried Ice Cream; it was awesome. The place was clean, and cheery inside,  and they even sold some seafood at the back of the eating area.  Not a lot of custom when we were there, but people should absolutely try it, Ole !!"}
{"text":"Really good place to eat and have drinks love the food here. Really fresh and made at the time you order. Waitress are nice specially Sílvia. Its a family restaurant love it"}
{"text":"I was driving by on my way to another restaurant and couldn't help but stop by with the hopes of getting some good authentic mexican seafood and I was not disappointed! The oysters on the half shell Pacifico style were fresh and amazing. There is a number 4 seafood special that had a dozen oysters with a large campechana that was amazing. The environment is what's expected not the nicest and the service wasn't the post prompt but all expected. The prices were average for fresh seafood in Arizona as well. We were very happy! Ps get the michelada! Just do it!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time coming here, the food is great! They are very welcoming and serve you right away. I love the atmosphere they have casino music playing everyday and musician's come in and play music as well. They have a lot to pick from rather it's just traditional mexican food or sea food they have it all. The prices are great if you want great tasting good quality food for a great price this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"This is a Mexican seafood restaurant and grocery.  You can dine-in or buy fish to bring home and cook.  For those who are unschooled in the field of eating in combo fish-shop/restaurants, the place will smell faintly like fish.  Fair warning if you find the smell repugnant.  Also, if you're experience with Mexican seafood ends with the fish taco or Baja Fresh, be warned - this place is not quite what you are expecting.  I dropped in, lured by promises of $5.99 lunch specials, and was surprised at the prices on the menu - most items were in the double-digit range, and I was only looking for a quick, cheap lunch.  The menu is large and varied, with everything from beef to octopus fully represented.  As tempting as the more expensive entreés sounded, I diligently stuck to my budget, opting for the $5.99 shrimp burrito.  $5.99 isn't bargain-basement for a burrito, but for a flour tortilla stuffed with shrimp, a standard ensalada, and some flavorful rice with vegetables, I'll bite.  The shrimp was in a sauce that had hints of citrus and tomato, and another bright, tangy note that I couldn't quite place. The shrimp itself was excellently cooked, not soggy like poor-quality ceviche or overly-rubbery like poorly defrosted frozen camarones. In short, delicious.  The rice tasted like it was cooked in some kind of broth, and had tomatoes and carrots thrown in for good measure.  Also delicious.  The salad was the standard that you get in most Mexican places, but, importantly, the iceberg lettuce, green bell pepper, and tomato all tasted fresh.  No limp lettuce here.  The veggies provided a very satisfying crunch to the burrito and the rice.  They also served beer and liquor."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but there mexican old school music was beyond amazing. A must try music"}
{"text":"I had never even heard of this place, but my dad loves it so this is where we had lunch. I'm personally not as big of a fan of Mexican seafood as  my family but I did try it here. Was I ever surprised at how much I enjoyed it. We ordered a dozen oysters and we had to order a second dozen because they were phenomenal. The beer and service was also amazing. As an entree I ordered a shrimp cocktail and it was delicious. I'm still not as big of a fan of seafood, but when I do crave it this is definitely the place to go"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.   After a severely disappointing experience at an upscale restaurant in LA, my boyfriend wanted to salvage my taste for oysters so he brought me here.   The oysters pacifico, covered in red sauce, avocado, and shrimp, is what all oysters should want to be when they grow up. We also got the mixed seafood cocktail served in a coconut, with the coconut water served in glass! The service was great - we came here for a late lunch and were the only customers. She brought us two cups of seafood soup to get our meal started.   The building has a large mural on one side, so it's hard to miss, and there are a few parking spots right next to the building."}
{"text":"Food was great: specialty oysters well worth it, toasty chips, unusual salsa (not uniformly liked at our table), burrito, chimi, complimentary seven seas soup, flan, and bland beans (with lots of hot sauces to jazz them up). Whoever said the servers are cute as kittens but erratic in serving was spot on. Ours fumbled several ordered items, but comped our flan to make up for it, cute kitten indeed! All's well that ends well, and we'll be back-not something my weekly lunch crew says often."}
{"text":"Actually, sometimes this place is a four..or a five, but overall I'd give it a three.  Anywho..  I tend to come here often.  We first came here because we had eaten at San Carlos Bay three times that past week and decided to give another mariscos place a try.  With each meal you get a small bowl of chips (more than one bowl will cost you extra).  I'm not a fan of the salsa, but I eat it anyway.  It's mostly liquid and a little spicy for me, and I think it has the consistency of that Chinese soup I don't know the name of.  I've ordered several different things, such as the camarónes al mojo de ajo (shrimp in garlic sauce), which isn't the best, but if you take out the shrimp, eat them separately, and then mix the sauce, rice, and beans together you get a strange concoction of awesomeness.  I've also ordered ceviche tostadas, which are good but HUGE (two was too many), as well the shrimp soup (caldo).  This was very good.  My husband tends to order the whole baked snapper pretty often (it's cheaper here than at San Carlos Bay, if you're into whole fish...), and sometimes they'll top it with shrimp for free.  The BEST thing about this place is that they often (but not always) will give you each a free appetizer.  You usually get a choice of either seven mares soup or a tiny bowl of ceviche, both of which are good with the chips.  I will say though, that before I started coming here I used to HATE soup.  Somehow the seven mares appetizer soup has turned me onto other soups (the shrimp soup here, same thing but less seafood, Japanese udon, and the lagman at Golden Valley Uzbek).  If you come on a Friday (and probably Saturdays, as well), you'll likely encounter karaoke night, which is often entertaining.  Unfortunately, this is also the reason for three stars.  Several times the karaoke was so loud we couldn't talk to each other and had to sit there awkwardly staring at the television.  Other times, though, the volume is totally fine.    This place also has a bar to sit and watch a game, and sells raw fish and other seafood as well (including ceviche) that you can just take home to cook.  Another mention is that the service is usually a little too good.  Checking on us every three minutes good.  But that's definitely better than never and the waitresses are always nice and helpful ;)   I think they have pretty good happy hour specials here, but we're never in time for them.  Someday I'll try a margarita."}
{"text":"Makes me wonder how many of these good reviews are from family members or workers. I would give it zero stars if possible first time I went food had no taste, beer was warm. Yes they did ask us many times if we needed anything so the waitress was good I guess. Once we left we left a small tip due to everything being so bad. That's when many of the employees (especially the drunk DJ) started pretty much demanding more tips and saying things.   The second time I was pretty much dragged to go again by some friends. Ordered something new this time but still the food wasn't that great compared to other places in that area. The beer was cold this time at least. The only thing I was not happy about though was that they took a 30% tip automatically this time. So I assume either they have great memories and remembered some of us from over almost two years ago. Or there's a lot of people not leaving tips due to their not so great food so they take their own tip."}
{"text":"Their boss/cook is very unprofessional changed prices on us after we ordered our food! 10min later (taco Tuesday) although the waitress said yes it's taco Tuesday still! We said fine will pay full price then she comes back and pretty much tell us our order is too much since we are closing!!!!! Are you kidding me so we had to reduce our order! Only reason we stayed still is because of my friend was super hungry or else joyride would of been my choice! Best tacos in town!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh.  And tasty!  We had oysters on the half shell with a shrimp/onions and avocado.  WOW!  My husband had a chili relleno with shrimp and I had a combination seafood cocktail.  The flavors were fresh and good.  Free cup of seafood soup, also wonderful.  I don't usually hand out 5 stars, but this one is worth it."}
{"text":"I came her with a friend who enjoyed the seafood. I'm not much for shrimp or oysters but thought why not try a new place. I was really disappointed to be honest. We were the only ones there and it took forever to get our food. I ordered a chile relleno with chicken and after a few minutes was told they were out of it. I didn't really see anything else on the menu I wanted so I went for the standard chicken quesadilla. It was very greasy and the cheese tasted like the one you get at Taco Bell. Not impressed and probably won't go back. Lack of service and the food wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"This place not recommend, food was cold, rice was soggy, lettuce wilted, and beans runny."}
{"text":"Super noisy place, you cant enjoy food, the guy who's at charge of sound barely cares, also you can hear while he is messaging from his computer, and they charge extra fee on everything! (Seasonings and chips). So doubleck first is not bad idea."}
{"text":"LA comida se defiende. Las micheladas no son una maravilla y ponen hielo tambien. Tocan musica a todo volume y te preguntan site queries aguacate en todo, ojo ni ponen sufisiente y te cobran DE .99-1.75 en cada cosa. Recomiendo La tostada de aguachiles y de callo de hacha. Las campechanas nooo. Tienen Pata de mula tambien. La mesera muy amable y buen servicio. Ojo pedimos campechana grande y medianan y no dieron  ostiones en nuestras campechanas. Nos trajieron tres como les cudra?"}
{"text":"Went here today and very much enjoyed my lunch.    I shared with my husband and we had the shrimp burrito red enchilada style and the fish burrito the same way.  Both super tasty.  The burritos were actually fairly light, not a heavy lunch like a typical burrito from most Mexican restaurants.  The red sauce was very good as was the texture and taste of the tortilla.  The shrimp and fish were excellent, very fresh tasting.  The burritos came with rice which was very good and a little side salad of lettuce, tomato, and cucumber with some cheese sprinkled on it, the veggies were all very fresh and crisp.  We also had the shrimp ceviche and it was very good as well.   The salsa that comes with the chips was also tasty.  It was not spicy, which I like, but for those looking for some spice you won't find it in the salsa that came standard.  Only thing I wasn't impressed with was the iced tea, very weak and tasted a little dirty.  But hey, next time I'll get a margarita instead!  I liked the atmosphere, felt like being in Mexico.  The service was friendly but a little slow, also very authentic Mexico!  Overall, definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We visited this place on a Saturday. The parking lots outside are not enough,  but you can park on the street. The first thing we noticed when we went in there was the loud music! There was a lady singing her heart out to a very bad song (IMO) and it was waaaaay to loud.  It had a karaoke bar feeling, but much louder since she was screaming! My BF and I couldn't have a decent conversation because we could barely hear each other think. The service was good, our server was very attentive and friendly, the food was pretty good! We ordered a dozen oysters and two shrimp cocktails and they were very delicious. The only negative thing about this place was the lady that thought she was a famous singer at a concert because she was going to town on the karaoke machine.   Would visit again, but if I can hear the karaoke machine when I come in, im turning around and leaving."}
{"text":"Tasty Mexican food, although a bit on the pricey side. Had the enchilada plate, which was three smaller tasty enchiladas covered by a pretty good red sauce. Although the parts of the meal were just better than average, the overall taste was really good. You should stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My review is based on the ambiance , food and service. The servers are cute as kittens but if you think you should be asked every 5 minutes how everything is then you will be sadly mistaken, because they are not working in a pretentious establishment. The place is definitely divey , which is absolutely fine , I just wish I could've sat Next to my husband like I Always do , in the booth we sat ourselves at. The table was surely long enough for a bigger booth seat but the seats just ran a bit shy of sitting a righty and a lefty on the same side. As per another review I went for the Campechana and I went GRANDE. If it was that good I want it tomorrow too. I also chose the Paella for the combo of seafood goodies , also get to have a second time due to the serving size. Oh , I also had the fried calamari , OMG They Know What They Are Doin There ! As well as with that Michelada I enjoyed so much. I only wish my husband had as goo of an experience as I did, which is why I docked them a star. Sorry guys but you screwed the pooch on the beef tonight. And my hubby is a great Cook so he can be particular but a tough piece of meat .........is a tough piece of meat.  Maybe next time.  Yes next time. We will be back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and if you get the ostiones Pacifico they are delicious. Great deals on Tuesdays and Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Everything was bad. From the sticky Spanish rice, to the tap water, to the cold food (that was supposed to be hot), to the service.  Will not go again!"}
{"text":"We went here one day, just the husband and I. It was okay. Maybe I didn't order the best thing on the menu, but the fish tacos were not impressive. We did get a free cup of soup which was pretty cool. I ate mine with the chips. It's close to my house, so it's easy. We might go here again, but I'm not sure."}
{"text":"LOVE this place for Baja style fresh fish and food! Always fresh, delicious, clean, and friendly. Laid back & casual with cold beer and a good tequila selection. You will NOT be disappointed. Give this little spot a try!! I suggest the Tostada Emarazada and a Modelo Especial."}
{"text":"Meh...it's cheap.  It's close to me.  It smells like the ocean in here (yes, fish....).  Cheap beers and drinks.  I might have had a couple of margaritas so this rating and review could be seriously flawed.  Worth a visit if you like the ocean and like to eat its inhabitants."}
{"text":"Been here twice and does not disappoint. I was the only gringa both times. First time my husband ordered for me in Spanish. Second time, I attempted some Spanglish as our server did not speak English very well. Another employee came out to verify our order. That was very nice, and good customer service. The food is excellent and the price is pretty good for seafood. I have ordered the seafood cocktails, ceviche, shrimp tacos, and all has been delightful!  I will add they do play the music here extremely loud in the evening, so if that bothers you come during the day or make sure you don't sit near the little DJ booth and speakers!"}
{"text":"Delicious seafood !! Great price! Shrimp ceviche , 7 seas soup and the Campechana cocktail were so yummy . Oysters were awesome too and affordable even when not on special!  I have visited at least 5 times."}
{"text":"Do you like Rocky Point? I do, and that is why this restaurant is like a brother to me, a weird, some-what attractive step-brother:) The facade may appear shady, but let's be honest, shady is good. Good food, this place is very authentic, and good prices, I am never upset. I have been to this restaurant many times for lunch. I like coming there because there are usually only a handful of customers and I can enjoy a lot of waitress attention.  You are greeted with a free cup of seafood soup that is so yummy and full of chunks of seafood. Aye papi! Did I mention that the seafood here is phenominal! They have this appetizer called oysters el pacifico that is moi bueno! It is oysters on the half shell with shrimp, avocado and red onions, very delicious. The restaurant is run by the whole family, papa is the chef, the daughter is the notary/manager and the son (Jr.) is the renaissance man. You are always treated like family in here. WARNING: The service is slow so if you are not going to enjoy food, culture and company, please do not go."}
{"text":"Not exactly the friendliest people.   I was nice to them, but it wasn't reciprocated.   They kicked me out after a beer and a margarita because I wasn't hungry.  And the bartender said \"Well, You might get drunk\"    Really?   This is a bar, Right??    C'Mon MAN.  Never gave me the WiFi password either."}
{"text":"The oysters are the best in town. I have only had seafood here but it has all been incredible."}
{"text":"El Pacifico is my 'go to' for Mexican seafood.  I will warn you now, if you're not familiar with 'street' mariscos places, then you might not be happy with this place.  It sells seafood by bulk, and fresh fish and shellfish, and so it has the scent of the business.  It's also 'down home', with vinyl checked table cloths and inexpensive tableware.  There's also TV and music, which can be loud sometimes.  But the food is muy bueno!  The seafood has always been invariably fresh and top notch.  I will even order oysters here without even a second thought.  I especially recommend the 'el pacifico' style.  The campechanas are 1st rate.  If you like Mexican seafood and go here for it, I think you will be VERY happy with this place.  It's a family run joint, and serves families...so if you're allergic to kids beware.  The folks here are attentive, the service is pretty good almost all the time.  The other patrons are often pretty friendly too, and on more than one occasion I've been sent drinks from other family parties, and returned the favor, too.  They have a good bar here too, with an excellent selection of tequilas.  But be aware that some 'American'  cocktail standards aren't normal in this kind of context, so don't be too picky if you order an Old Fashioned or a Rob Roy....  But the standard Mexican types have been perfecto!  So if you know Mexican street seafood..and that's what you're after, I give this place the full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not a seafood fan. I know! For shame! I am a native Arizonan, so give me a break here. The oysters looked so delicious that I decided to face my fears and try one. I am SO GLAD I did. The age old Mexican symphony of hot sauce, lime juice and avocado makes these ugly little mollusks sing! TRY THEM. I even ate some fried Octopus...several pieces. Who am I??? It was delicious! My mom and I are Michelada connoisseurs, so I has high expectations. They were delicious (and nutritious?). I had the Tostada with shrimp ceviche, piled high with shrimp & avocado. My mom had the beef albondigas soup. It was delicious, but I like rice in my albondigas, to be honest. The meatballs can't be all alone in their last moments! We rolled ourselves out of there impressed and stuffed. I will definitely come back. And to anyone on here complaining about lack of English skills...I just can't roll my eyes hard enough at you. It's a Mexican restaurant in a historically Mexican neighborhood in a state that used to be...you guessed it... MEXICO."}
