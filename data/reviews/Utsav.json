{"text":"Really good Indian. Got the Chicken Tikka and it was awesome. Great naan too."}
{"text":"very delicious food and very nice service. Love it:)
We tried that valentine's menu. We love the butter chicken and that shrimp very much."}
{"text":"One of my go to place for dining out. You won't regret eating here. I have tasted almost every dish and almost all were good."}
{"text":"2 reasons that the 5 stars went to 3 stars - bland food and inexperienced service.

I ordered my chicken saag and felt it was on the bland side, no kick to it really. Other thing that really, really, did not make ANY sense to me - FOOD DOES NOT COME WITH RICE. You have to order it! What kind of crap is that? That's like going out for sushi and paying extra to have rice on your sushi roll! Prices were expensive enough for the amount of food/quality/NO RICE, so why charge for the rice?

My friend and I were very annoyed with our waitress by the end of dinner. I don't appreciate being asked, \"you know that 1 naan is 4 pieces, you ordered 2 naan so that's 8.\" Yes, I'm aware, I just love naan. She also prematurely picked up our plates, did not ask if we wanted boxes but instead started picking up our food and I said hey, we want boxes! Was annoying with water service (too many interruptions) and did not understand the paying with credit card thing. It seemed to confuse her. The last thing that drove me to write this review is that she packed both my friend and I's dishes in the same to go box. I got chicken, and my friend is vegetarian. Way to go, my friend couldn't even eat her leftovers. Not to mention there was some food missing from the box!

Anyway, that was my experience with the place. Food and service are just okay, nothing spectacular for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Ever since I discovered this restaurant 4 years ago, I have stopped going to other Indian restaurants in Toronto. The food is authentic and the service is great (staff are extremely pleasant). 

Top picks:
Saag Paneer (Being Indian, I can honestly say this is the best saag paneer I have ever had here and in India)
Chicken Tikka Masala
Lamb Biryani
Garlic Naan
Gulaab Jamun
Tandoori Prawn
Dal Makhani
Aloo Gobi

I highly recommend this Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"This restaurant and its owners are a joy. These folks stick to their knitting, delivering a simple but comprehensive menu in a clean, tasteful space in the heart of Yorkville. I take out lunch at least once per week and am always greeted warmly. I can't say enough nice things about Utsav."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Friday night with friends. I'd recommend making a reservation as the place is reasonably small and seems pretty popular based on the full tables for our entire stay. 

The food was served very quickly and was quite good as well. We enjoyed the aloo gobi and chicken vindaloo quite a lot, but did not care for the butter chicken. 

The best part about this place is the service. All of the staff were extremely warm, attentive, and polite. 

Overall it was a really nice evening, and I would happily go back."}
{"text":"Unprofessional place - I went there and the restaurant was open - I arrived there 50 mins before closing time.  The waisted took me to the table and was about to seat me and then a dude came and start talking to him in some language and then the waiter asked me to leave saying kitchen is closed.  I said why do you have open sign outside and people are still waiting for food so obviously the kitchen is not closed.  He did not respond and kept saying I am sorry."}
{"text":"Really Nice service, and really tasty Indian food (good selection of speciality Naan) and the Korma was quite good, also enjoyed their selection of basmati and difference rices. Total was under $50.00 for two people. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Preferred via Uber and had the aloo gobi, baigan ka bartha, chicken tikka masala, and shrimp malai curry.

The chicken tikka masala is their chefs specialty and I have to save I quite enjoyed it. I like spicy food and it was a medium level of spice. I didn't need lots of ice water to cool down but it had a little kick to it. It is white meat chicken and had 5 or 6 big pieces and lots of sauce.

The aloo gobi was my second favourite. It was very flavorful and had a lot potato and cauliflower. The only thing I didn't care for were the chunks of tomatoes which I'm not a fan of.

I tried the shrimp based on the review of a previous reviewer. It is a dish I would recommend for those that can't handle spice as it was not spicy at all but still flavourful.

I like eggplant so I ordered the bartha. Sadly this was my least favourite as it had big chunks of onion and tomato. Flavour for me was ok though if you don't mind these ingredients."}
{"text":"I moved to Toronto in the dead of winter. Utsav was an easy stumble in the snow or only a call away for delivery. But more importantly, the food is consistently amazing. It's a favorite spot to take out of town guests looking for good Indian."}
{"text":"My partner and I were craving Indian Food and we were in the Yorkville area after work and met up with some friends who recommended this place.  From the moment we entered, the staff were lovely.  The ambiance was incredible - the food was outstanding, both him and I will agree that it was the best we had ever eaten in Toronto.  FRESH - FRESH and FRESH!  The presentation was also quite incredible and the manners and etiquette shown to the patrons was truly incredible.  I noted the owner several times out on the floor, ensuring we were all very well taken care of, and that in my books is exactly what the owner of an establishment should be doing, as I am myself.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food was good, nothing spectacular though. The chicken vindaloo that we ordered was tasty with lots of spices, and the lamb biryani was good but not as tasty as expected. All in all, it was an average Indian food experience. Not great value for money."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance, service. Even got us our chai to go after we said we couldn't stick around to have it."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE!!

PRICE: 
Great prices (aka $10 for sag paneer). This is especially great considering it's in Yorkville and for the quality of food, it's a downright steal!

SERVICE: 
The staff are such wonderful people who make you feel at home and the food is so good that I imagine any Indian mother would be proud to serve that to her children. 

AMBIANCE:
Not the best considering it's quite small with no special visual features but I think this plays into the overall feeling of the place. You're not there to be dazzled with the decor but rather you're made to feel like you're dining in a friends home.

FOOD:
This is definitely my default go-to Indian restaurant. Utsav has some of the best Indian food in the city. A small family-run business with a small dining room, what they may lack in flashy decor or seating space they more than make up for in quality of food. 

DO NOT MISS: 
- Onion kulcha isn't on their menu from what I recall but they'll be more than happy to make it and they do so wonderfully. 
- Butter chicken. Classic. Best I've had. The chicken is tender and juicy and not dry like how it can be in other places.
- Sag Paneer. Great dish.
- Their eggplant dish is also very good."}
{"text":"Butter chicken and tikka masala were on point! The sauce was a bit spicy for me and they offered to change it free of charge. Service was impeccable as always."}
{"text":"This is a go-to for Indian in the yorkville area. Lovely little place to enjoy a good meal served by gracious staff."}
{"text":"We came as a group of 25 for dinner. We initially didn't know the restaurant only seats around 35 people, so we took up most of the restaurant. The service staff were very patient with us throughout the night despite the difficulty of us ordering a la carte instead of from a prix fixe menu. Understandably the kitchen was a bit swamped, but the food was still very excellently prepared.

We tried a lot of their appetizers, and the group seemed to particularly enjoy the fish tikka and murg malai tikka. I had the Goan fish curry paired with lachha parantha and it was simply exquisite. The curries are probably not that spicy, but still very aromatic and flavourful. Overall, a delightful experience at very reasonable price, especially considering its location in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Being of Indian descent, we know our Indian food.  We ordered the Fish Tikka starter and the Saag Paneer, as well as the Daal Makhani.  The food was entirely average or below average, and we have eaten at over 50+ Indian restaurants.  The Saag was bland and the Daal Makhani a little more watery without the deep taste it deserves.  The Fish Tikka was okay and suits western taste as its simply Salmon baked in Tikka spice.   It could have been an off day for the chef, and so can't fully judge on one experience.

The ambience is a quaint little non fancy Indian restaurant, which is fine, no problem with it.  Its not overly fancy and you could go casual and be perfectly fine.  The service was reasonable, you have to call the waiter over when you're ready but we don't find that much different from many other Indian restaurants.  

The prices were reasonable as well, but for food that was below our standard, unfortunately that's not enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"What a jewel sitting amongst the ongoing concrete transformation of Yorkville! In a warm inviting ambience Utvan's Goan fish Curry was a nuanced delight. The delicate but distinctive spicing left me wanting more even though the portion was quite abundant for one person. The Chai tea is delicious too. I highly recommend this oasis."}
{"text":"Great Indian food, highly recommend. It's a small place with limited tables and they fill up quickly because this place serves delicious Indian food! One of the best butter chickens I've had.. Service is always fast and very friendly.. Will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"4/5! I highly recommend this place. The service is fantastic and the food is authentic (chefs from Delhi). I recommend the saag paneer, chicken tikka masala and lamb biryani. It is one of the few indian restaurants where the saag paneer is not filled with oil. The chefs can tailor the spice to your liking. Make sure you go with a big appetite!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here the other night. All the food we got was meh. We likely will not be back. We got the butter chicken and the chicken tikka masala. Both were meh. On the plus side, the rice we had to make at home went well with all the extra sauce from the dishes."}
{"text":"Super convenient location. Super lovely deco.
It is my first time trying Indian cuisine. And it was such an amazing experience.
Ordered garlic naan and butter chicken according to the staff's recommendation and they all turn out to be good choice.
The chicken itself is tender, but kind of dry. But the sauce is art. I will say it's clean and refresh. After you finish, only the fragrance of spice stay in your mouth, not the curry.
The garlic naan is also chewy enough.
I ordered butter naan later. And I really really love it. The outer layer is crispy, while the inner layer is chewy. You can smell the wonderful butter. 
For me, most restaurants are delicious, but nothing impressive. But this one is not only delicious, but \"wow\"!!"}
{"text":"Really really loved both the 
Gosht Beryani and Chicken Tikka. 

I usually \"hate\" Beryani but honestly I have not had Beryani that's this fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Love! Lamb vindaloo, chana masala, butter chicken are my usual and best veg samosas. The staff is just lovely. Very affordable for Yorkville. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Utsav on Friday... I don't think I'll order from anywhere else from now on! Great value for the price. The sag paneer was fantastic as was the chicken tikka masala. The chicken was tender and there was a lot of it! They also added green peppers which I haven't seen in a chicken tikka before but it was a nice touch. The veggie samosas were just okay, a bit on the greasy side. An order of rice is massive, way more than what you get at other places! Utsav is definitely worth a try in my opinion"}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant in one of the weekly or every other week emails from Yelp. I had received the email of  5 restaurants, and I thought I'd try this one first. Plus, it was also good timing, as I treated out my mother for her 56th birthday. 

I definitely recommend you make reservations for this restaurant. I made an Open Table reservation for 7:15PM and arrived there on time. There's ample parking nearby. Either street, or Green P parking within 2 to 5 minutes walking distance. I'd go with the multi-level Green P parking, and the rate is $6 flat on Saturday evenings. Arriving at the restaurant, we had to wait outside for a bit, as there were few other patrons in front of us waiting to be seated. They either had reservations or not. I warn you, and I bet others have, this place is tiny to begin with, so its highly recommended you make reservations. A party of 2 were rejected, as all the tables were reserved. 

We waited for 5 minutes, and were seated. There was a tad miscommunication with the reservations I had made with Open Table. I had to show the reservation on my phone, and they then seated us. They did have my name, but apparently they didn't write it properly down. There were only two waiters, and 1 bus boy. We were seated by the corner, and one portion it was  very cramped. Granted, it was due to the place being \"small\", however we managed. 

There were probably 5 to 6 other groups before us, and we had to wait 15 minutes for our orders to be taken. We ordered the onion bhajia, which looked more like pakoras. Bhajias are usually rounder. I know this because, pakoras and bhajias are usually of South Indian cuisine. For the entrees, we ordered the dhingri masala, and baigan ka bartha. We ordered a serving of basmati rice, followed by naan, tandoori roti and lachha parantha (pronounced paratha). 

The appetizers took 30 minutes to arrive, and the waiter apologized. However, it was definitely worth the wait. I've never had such exquisite onion bhajias/pakoras in my life. Well other than my mom of course. These were the next best, and even now writing about it, and thinking about it, its making my mouth water. They were crisp, fried properly, and the overall taste were great. They did not skimp out on the portions of this. Soon after 10 minutes, the main dishes, rice and the rest arrived. I won't really comment about the rice, as there's nothing to comment. It was cooked, so that's a positive thing. For the naan, lachha parantha, and tandoori roti, they were tasty. The texture was great, and not salty. I've been to places where they have naan or tandoori roti which are salty.  Again no issues with the portion. Coming to the entrees, the spice level was just right, the amount of salt was perfect, and you could tell that they did not rush the dish. All three of us were able to finish everything, and not leave one bit of gravy left. 

I was also amazed by the overall price, and I'd say out of all the Indian restaurants I've been to in the GTA, both vegetarian and mixed, this would be #1. Definitely there's value for the money paid, and I'll definitely come back. 

Here's what could improve. P.S I am not including the fact that the place is \"tiny\", so that's understandable. 

1) The service could be better. Waiting for 15 minutes for us to take our orders, when we were the only table left at the time we arrived. The other tables were already having their dinner. Two tables came after us in a 30 to 45 minute period, and they had their orders taken promptly. We also had to wait 20 minutes to get our cheque, despite the fact that they cleared out our table, and notifying the wait staff that we are ready for the cheque. 

2) They gave out complimentary Papadam, which is not to be confused with Appalam, another South Indian variation. They only gave three, and I feel that perhaps they could have given slightly more. 

3) The green chutney for the Papadam was very watery. Usually this chutney should be slightly thicker. 

That being said, I can see myself returning back, and will recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this restaurant several times on uber eats.. The amount of actual meat and paneer is a little stingy but the taste is phenomenal . I always order the Saag Paneer and Chicken Tikka Masala.  The Butter Chicken is OK. I've also previously ordered the Chicken Tikka as an appetizer and for $13 it literally came with 5 small pieces of chicken.. will not be ordering it again.. also the Baigan Ka Bartha had a little much onions for my liking.

There is likely a lot of MSG as I'm constantly reaching for water .. But great as a hangover food.

Also for every one order of the samosa and pakora they give you two pieces and they're generous with the sauces.. it's all about that sauce."}
{"text":"Gem of a restaurant! Probably the best indian food in Toronto!  Each time we go we thoroughly enjoy the food and Suresh is such a warm and welcoming host.  We will keep going back there time and time again!  If you haven't been here...go now!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food in Toronto. Haven't been to many in the city, but my hotel just happened to be around the block so I decided to come here. Not many people eating here around 9pm (understandable considering the freezing January weather). Staff could've been slightly more attentive for how slow it was at that hour but the food was overall amazing. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here yesterday. Really small and quaint but still got a fancy flair. The chicken masala was juicy and full of flavor. Their garlic nan was great and in general the dishes were well seasoned and cooked fresh in my opinion. Will be dropping by again."}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible service. We got the distinct impression we were not welcome. Sitting for an hour with dirty dishes on the table, waiting for your bill, being completely ignored, is unacceptable -- especially when you have 3 wait staff and empty tables. Rude. And I've had way better Indian many times over."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food. The staff is friendly and explains the dishes well. They have good recommendation according to what you're looking for and in terms of quantity or spicyness. A good address with decent prices given the area."}
{"text":"Had dinner there before seeing Lion...very appropriate. Food was tasty, price reasonable for the area and service very friendly.

The reason I downgraded was the washroom facilities...very poor and not clean. I would suggest an overhaul as it totally took away from the dining experience, so won't be going back for now."}
{"text":"Awesome family run business that has a small dining room, but is some of the most inventive Indian cuisine in a pleasant and quaint Yorkville setting. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Perfect for lunch! Food is delicious and lamb sag is highly recommended. Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Worst Indian restaurant in the world. Ordered 3 vegetarian dishes. Horrible! Naans had no taste at all either. We went there because it had 4 star rating. We're quite surprised to see only one table occupied but after eating there we understand why."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Polite, attentive and knowledgeable. 
Butter chicken was very tomato-y and would be good if you like that style. I prefer something more creamy. 
Lentil soup was delicious and very well heated!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would.

Came to pick up a few lunch orders, and worst customer service I've received in a while.

1) They wouldn't write down what the lunch order was on the packaging. I had asked them to write it down since we had quite a few orders so we wouldn't mix it up. They refused. They said \"It would mess up the food\". Not sure how it would mess up the food if you're simply lifting a lid, and writing it down. More like lazyness. 

2) They don't have a proper till and could barely provide change.I received quarters for my change of $20. How does a restaurant not have a proper till? 

3) The butter chicken was watery and barely any chicken at all. 

Skip this place, The Host down the street is way better and more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Saturday with my girlfriend. It had pretty good review and we were feeling something that we haven't had in a while. 

The place is a small cozy restaurant. We were greeted right when we got in and were seated promptly. 

We ordered one chicken dish (chicken masala) and one lamb dish (lamb madrasi). The price were very good for the location ($14 per dish). We also got two garlic naan, which seemed like it was made pretty fresh. 

Both dishes were excellent. The lamb just melts! We would definitely visit again"}
{"text":"5 stars for food, 3 for the service. Kind of unfortunate because this restaurant has such huge potential to be a 5 star restaurant. Service is a bit slow so be prepared to wait (even for your bill). 

Now, let's talk about the food. By far one of the best Indian food I've tried in the city. They have many different options, including vegetarian dishes. And every dish is made with tradition and mouth-watery flavours in mind. The food was a hit! 

I would definitely recommend this place. Go before 6pm to avoid crowds. And I'm not sure if I'd recommend coming here in larger groups (the place is a bit on the small side)."}
{"text":"This is a really great Indian restaurant in the Yorkville area. Their naan is good and the service is friendly. I've tried the butter chicken and lamb saag. Both dishes are very flavorful. This is definitely my go-to place for Indian food downtown."}
{"text":"I came here couple of times and just love it!
Price is very fair and the food is delicious! 
The Lamb Sag is my favourite! 
Owner always around, great staff, amazing chefs!"}
{"text":"Eaten here three times in the past two months. One of the best Indian restaurants in the city. Great staff and great food for a decent price."}
{"text":"The peas in the paneer dish tasted like they'd been frozen, thawed, frozen again, thawed again. They were like really hard chalk. The paneer didn't taste good either; it had a really bad texture. The biryani was way too oily, and not flavorful. The portions were miserably small.

I definitely won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"This Indian restaurant is so affordable and the food is amaze-balls. I love it. My family enjoying this place very much. And when we are in the area we always eat here. One of our favorite dining places in the town. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Okay Indian place in Yorkville. Decent portioned lunch special with soup, salad and samosa included with one lunch item. I has the butter chicken with that. Everything was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Great place, amazing food inspired by a northern Indian cuisine. Generous owner. We  just wish the place was a bit bigger."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious Indian cuisine at a very affordable price point. I'm so glad I tried something different for a change.

The service was attentive and only came when necessary. 

The atmosphere was very clean and open, but still felt private. GREAT spot for date night with your partner :) 

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Very nice food. The service is excellent. They will make sure if the spice level is okay for you. If not they will adjust it."}
{"text":"The environment and the location is 10/10, I thought I was going to spend 30 dollars eating at such a place but their lunch special is 13 dollars(includes tax) for salad+entree+nann+rice, it is very good value. The food is really nice, I ordered chicken tikki masala, the portion is really reasonable. Only thing I didn't like is that they put everyone's nann together, and put everyone's rice together. It is kinda hard and awkward to keep track of how much I can still eat. But overall it is really nice."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I ordered takeout: Mulligatawny Soup, Baingan Ka Bhartha and Bhindi Bhaji. First of all, the soup tasted like water crackers.  The eggplant was okay but a bit lackluster in flavour. Texture was much to be desired. It was really quite indistinguishable from Iams. Ugh. The okra was just okay. I enjoyed that it was not complete mush on my basmati rice.
I might give Utsav another shot."}
{"text":"We had the mattar paneer, spiced okra, naan and achar. The food was all excellent (very spicy!), but the service, while friendly, was very slow, because they only had one server to handle service & bussing for the whole place (9 tables). They need at least one more person. We had to wait about 45 minutes after finishing our meal to have our food boxed up and to check out.

Highly recommend the lentil soup, which is some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Delicious indian food and great service. The best butter chicken I have tasted. I will definitely go back! The naan bread was excellent. My husband and I also got the daily special which compliments the butter chicken."}
{"text":"What they lack in customer service, they gain in their food quality. We tried several items off the menu, and enjoyed everything we ate.

I would highly recommend the chicken tikka masala with their fresh naan. We also tried the briyani and lamb curry which satisfied our taste buds. All items are reasonably priced. 

However, our waitress took forever to give us water, take our order, bring out our food and give us our bill at the end. We had to request each step several times. This really shocks me given the small size of the reataurant; you would think they would rush us out in order to serve the next guests."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant to enjoy lunch in the bustling neighborhood of Yorkville. The lunch special is ~$10 per person and comes with a small garden salad (basic mix of lettuce, some tomato and cucumber slices), long grain rice, naan (crispier and less doughy than I'm used to) and your choice of entree. When dining for two, all dishes except the mains are purposely provided to share. The salad was quite small and appeared to be the serving size for one; however, we were told that it was for sharing. It's unclear if you dined in for 1, if you'd receive the same portion size. In terms of the mains, the flavors were robust with just the right amount of spiciness. We were not asked what level of spiciness we preferred, so if you like something on the spicier scale, it's best that you speak up and request it. The chicken tikka masala was light on the cream, so the tomato base wasn't as heavy and overpowering as others that I've had. The lamb saag was very tender and seemed fairly light/refreshing for what usually is very thick and rich. We very much enjoyed all of the food, and after cleaning virtually all of the plates, were utterly stuffed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite Indian restaurant, it's a small location in Yorkville with the most inviting and warm atmosphere. The food is authentic, homemade and amazing! The service is great, the servers are all very pleasant. My favorite dishes would be the Saag Paneer, Daal Makhni and the shrimp vindaloo - also the garlic naan is always fresh and amazing"}
{"text":"This little place has some of the best indian food I've ever had. I'm not an expert by any means so don't think I'm qualified to pronounce on such things, but I know what I like, and this was great.

The restaurant itself is tiny and we had to be squeezed into a little two seater that should have been reserved as a coat rack, but it was busy and we were hungry. The service is very friendly and I got the impression this is a family-run business from the kitchen to the waitstaff.

I'd probably eat here again out of all the places in Yorkville if I was ever in the neighbourhood again."}
{"text":"We had the lamb korma and chicken tikka masala with basmati rice. Both dishes tasted great! The ambience was nice, and the service was good as well. We would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing North Indian food served here. Curries were delicious, garlic naan very well done, and the pakoras were out of this world good. I lived in Jersey, so I'm very familiar with Indian food, and this place is definitely one of the best I've been to."}
{"text":"The food was ok but nothing great.  Some reviews talked about this being the best Indian food in Toronto, and I find that hard to believe.  One dish we got, the cashew curry( I think) was completely flavorless.  The saag paneer, samosas, and chicken masala were all mediocre."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

Pros:
-awesome lamb curry
-best naan bread ever
-great samosas

Cons:
-no air conditioning ( I went on a hot day)
-small space
-bad service

To elaborate on the cons, I went on a hot day and the small space and heat just made it uncomfortable to eat the hot food. They had one air purifier that blew air but it was right at the front of the restaurant and my group was in the very back near the kitchen. It wouldn't have been bad if we were up by the air but I feel it's unacceptable for a restaurant to have no AC in a place like Toronto where it can get pretty hot. The service was lackluster. We waked in, and one waiter looked at us and I said we had four people and just kinda walked off. We ended up walking to the end where there was a table. Then we sat down and waited about 7 minutes for any sort of attention. No menus, no water, nada. We also had to remind them about things like refilling water, the chutney and rita we ordered, and the rice. Overall, this place had great food but an uncomfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Utsav came highly recommended by a foodie friend in Toronto and it did not disappoint .

It's a small, 6-8 table  family oriented Indian restaurant right at the entrance to Yorkville. The service is run by an older gentleman who is very courteous and accommodating of requests to either food or service. The prices are very reasonable and are much below the $$$ range of Yorkville restaurants. One note, reservation handling wasn't the best. Otherwise, service was good. Service: 4 stars. 

What stands out about Utsav is the cooking. Each dish is delicious and prepared very well. The dishes are well crafted allowing the flavors from the spices to come out very well. Excellent flavors. Food: 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I've always been welcomed here with a warm smile and delicious food! My husband and I are vegetarian and usually order a couple of the veggie entries and the lecha parathas and they never disappoint. 

The bhindi masala and the achari paneer are my favorite! The parathas are fluffy and flaky. 

The decor is cozy, bright and clean, and I really enjoy the modern art pieces - very different from the typical kitschy photos at other Indian restaurants.

I've found the service to be quick and very welcoming every time I've been here, at least thrice, probably more times now. Thank you for that!"}
{"text":"I read good reviews for this place and decided I wanted to order from here since they were so close. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and the Paneer makhani. While the chicken was good, the paneer was awful, to say the least. The Paneer tasted as if it was from the 'Ready to Eat' packets by MTR. The restaurant thinks they can serve their customers readymade dishes and charge ~$12 for it. If you decide to go to this place, I would suggest you to stay away from Paneer dishes. 
I wouldn't go here again!"}
{"text":"Apparently, if you go during dinner time. the curry does NOT come with rice nor pita..... so you have to order them, otherwise i doubt you can swallow the super savory (or spicy depends on your order) curry dish.... small portion but tasty!, price is very reasonable consider it is yorkvile area. hmmm your clothes smell like it after you leave the restaurant..."}
{"text":"I think this is the first Indian restaurant I'm reviewing, I could be wrong but it's def my fave. 

I've been to a couple, none were worth reviewing except this one. I've been here a few times. I normally don't like Indian food to begin with but this place has made me less stubborn. 

The portions are huge so you can def share with up to 3-4 people or have leftovers for a full portion dinner the next day too ( better if you share with less tho; that way you have more deliciousness for you and company of 1 more haha ) 

We ordered: 

Matar Paneer - $10
Cottage cheese and green peas cooked in butter flavoured onion and tomato gravy

Chicken Vindaloo - $14
Chicken cooked with herbs and spices in special hot spicy and tangy sauce with potatoes

Vegetable Biryani -$10
Saffron flavoured basmati rice cooked with vegetables, spices and nuts. 

Nan -$2 
Leavened bread

Gulab Jamun -$5 
Condensed milk balls in sugary syrup 

This is a wonderful spot, anyone looking for authentic Indian food, this is the place to go. They deliver as well and it's pretty quick. 

Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"One the best Indian food I've had!
It's a hidden gem. 
Butter chicken - extra spicy and I love how its a good balance of tomato sauce and spices.
Paneer - so rich that it's makes you want to order more
Biryani - I ordered vegetarian, chicken, lamb(not my favorite)"}
{"text":"Ordered through Ubereats .. had lamb vindaloo and garlic Naan ... vindaloo was great and spiced the way I like it and it went well with the garlic Naan .. should have ordered 4 instead of 3 .. will try again in hopes that Uber hires more couriers that understand english"}
{"text":"I have not been here before my recent visit, despite working a block away.  Why?  Not sure, but I really enjoyed the food.

It is small, so reservations are probably a good idea.  I went with a small group so was able to sample the lamb saag, lamb madrasi and chicken masala.  I enjoyed all three dishes.  These are northern indian style curries, which is my preference.  

My only complaint is that their menu is quite small.  But perhaps they simply like to keep it to the things they do best, which isn't a bad thing.  

These were all lunch specials - salad, rice, naan and a dish, $10.  You get a lot of food considering the price.  Service was pleasant.  I'm definitely going to go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Friday evening with a friend. Found it to be a small and quiet resto located in an unassuming location. We walked in without reservations and had no problems. Kinda off street level, need to walk down stairs to access it. 

Prices are reasonable for Yorkville but I did think portions were a bit small. Dishes are to share. 

I ordered the Chicken Makhni (butter chicken) $14, which included chicken grilled in tandoor and creamy tomato sauce. Paired it with the Garlic Nan $3 (nan bread baked with fresh garlic). Pretty happy with my selection, food was definitely good and savoury. 

My friend ordered the Biryani (rice dish), forgot if it was the Chicken or Gosht dish but they wanted it spicy. Omg, I took a bite and basically finished a glass of water. Lol. I am bad with spicy food though. 

Food was good but I think we were surprised at the portions. It's a bit small for price and for my nan I only got like 3 slices which you had to reorder for refills. 

Service was okay for me. I didn't feel like we were welcomed as much as others? They tried to stick us near the front door in a small table squashed next to another couple, which I didn't appreciate because it's winter and anyone coming in will bring a blast of cold air and snow. We were also carrying a ton of bags too. The entire restaurant was basically almost empty and there were at least 3 other empty non-reserved tables they could have offered. I know this cause the entire time we were there  no one sat at those tables. We ended up getting one close to the kitchen/washroom and cash register area. So it was kinda awkward in my opinion. 

Overall, I would still recommend if you are in the area but I won't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and prices were really good. Portions are pretty big. I had the lunch butter chicken special. 

The lunch special includes salad, butter chicken, rice and the naan. 

The salad...i actually did not like the salad at all. It had some sort of spices that made it sweet and sour. The tomatoes and mangoes that they added in made it taste much better, but there wasnt enough of it to cover for that odd aftertaste.

Butter chicken was done nicely and had lots of flavor. It came with a big bowl of rice (enough for 2-3 bowls) and naan. Rice was dry, but the naan was done perfectly.

Service needs to be better because they didnt refill the water and never noticed my raised hand for 5 minutes.

But as it costs 11$ for everything, im perfectly fine with that.

Very pricey for dinner though and not worth it. 

This is for within the area, there are better Indian places, but not within a working lunch distance."}
{"text":"This is a tiny restaurant in Yorkville (surprisingly one of the more affordable options and probably the least pretentious).  It's a bit hidden as you need to go down a few steps.  It's clean and decorated simply - it gives it that humble appearance.  

I came on a weekday for lunch and it was about half full.  I ordered the Goan fish (I believe this is a lunch special only) which came with a salad and rice.  

It was flavourful and delicious - chunks of fish in that aromatic curry sauce make you want to go yum!  It's not spicy (not all indian food is!) but the spices melded nicely together.   I'd definitely come back if I was in the area and try a few of their other dishes."}
{"text":"had a great relaxng time here Saturday evening.
Very friendly staff.

We had the Jhinga tandoori, Baigan ka bartha, Bhindi bhaji, channa masala and garlic naan.

I love Indian... and this place gets an A+ in my book because it was full of flavor and spice... minus all the salt and extra oil.
the healthiest/cleaniest Indian I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"Reading previous reviews, I was excited to try Utsav for the first time. I was left very disappointed. Recently my husband and I have been going to many Indian restaurants, our favourite is still Little India. 

The ambiance is average. The decor is modern and some Indian accents in the pictures. Tables are a generous size and in fact I believe you can create more seats with smaller tables. Service is normal but there are only two servers who do everything from hosting, taking orders, drinks, running food and taking payment. We came on a not so busy night but I cannot imagine the service if they were full.

We ordered the Vegetable Samosa, Chicken Tikka Marsala, Lamb Curry, Okra, Garlic Naan, Basmati Rice and Chai tea. The meat is very overcooked. The amount of spice is higher than expected. The samosa was doughy not crunchy. The rice is not a fragrant spiced rice you would imagine from an Indian restaurant. We were so disappointed in everything. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"If you are in the area and crave Indian food, this is a nice place to go to.
It is a small restaurant, and the atmosphere, with pale yellow walls is not the typical Indian Restaurant decor, but I liked it.  The food was good and our waitress friendly. Utsav was not too far from our hotel, so it was quite convenient, but I would not make a special trip to eat there.  A nice little Indian restaurant, but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch.... lunch specials are great. Had the butter chicken with some extra spice and boy, was it hot! The rice was nice and fluffy. The naan was soft and crispy. The staff are super 
attentive and the owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"I am so happy that this place delivers!

I am pretty picky when it comes to having North Indian food, and this place makes my taste buds happy.

I have a few key dishes that I just generally love and this place does them very well- chicken tikka masala ( amazing) and saag paneer. 

For those of you who have never tried a Latcha Parantha- give it a go. Its basically a roti that has been layered and cooked in a tandoor. It is beautiful.

I heart Utsav

Ps. the nicest people ever!"}
{"text":"I love Utsav. Well-spiced food. What more could I want? Their butter chicken is flavourful. It tastes great and they are able to do a sweet and spicy version. mmm! The veggie pakoras are yummy. Love the garlic naan. Bland dishes don't exist here. They keep our usual order on file so it's quick & easy.

They have only ever let me down once. I headed there with some colleagues for lunch. When we asked for some takeaway containers the waitress brought dirty containers. It looked as though someone had spilled some food on the lids. Sigh. Sooo embarrassing. If the food wasn't so yummy that would have been it for me, but yummmm so good!"}
{"text":"Excellent butter chicken & lamb vindaloo. Naan bread is always served hot and fresh! 
Friendly staff & casual atmosphere. One of the best Indian restaurants in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"We can't express how delighted we are after great great dinner.  The food is fantastic taste,  fantastic quality.Great ambiance and good music.  Not like typical Indian music which even they don't listen back in India.  Atmosphere was like Toronto with Indian food.  It is must go place. 

We are visiting Toronto from US and we want something similar back home at Dallas.: -)

Me and wife are super foodie and we eat almost anyplace. Believe me,  for Indian food,  this is the place. We walked 30 mins in search for this place but it was worth coming here. 

Worth every penny and efforts!!  Must go !!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I came here for lunch with my parents over Easter weekend. The restaurant was sparsely populated which had me worried at first, but I guess there just weren't a lot of people out over Easter. I would be really surprised if this place wasn't packed for regular lunch service on a Saturday.

We ordered three dishes to share amongst the three of us with rice, naan and roti on the side. The Matar Paneer and Chana Masala both packed a punch which I really enjoyed. The Chicken Tikka Masala was a bit lighter on the spice, but made up for it with lots of large tender chunks of chicken. Overall it was a fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 6:15. It is now 6:40 and we JUST got waters. When we asked if we could order, the waitress said she had other tables' orders to take (...can you imagine how much longer THEY had been waiting?!) With only 2 employees working a busy Sunday rush, neither of them seem to be in much of a hurry to do anything. In 4 minutes, I will have been waiting to order for HALF AN HOUR. I can't even fathom how long I will have to wait before I get my food. TERRIBLE service, I don't even care how good the food is."}
{"text":"This place has grown on me. It's a small restaurant downstairs to the Chinese restaurant Dynasty. Small, but quiet. I think the word is quaint! I would say this has become my favorite restaurant in the yorkville area.

I think it's a small operation here, probably a family business. I say this because i think the service is really good here.  The low noise level is also good for conversation as well. 

I keep coming back here though for the fish curry. The first time i had it, i found myself thinking, it's good but nothing that would keep me coming back... Little did i know :) it's mild in flavor, not a lot of zip or zings. It's strangely this aspect of it that when i want fish curry, i think of utsav. And i mean this in the nicest way, because i do come back here for it.

This last time we also got the sag paneer and veggie pilau. Yum! I thought everything tasted so good. Good food, good atmosphere, good service. Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"On the most recent Toronto visit, another visit to Utsav was in store.  The owner is so nice and accommodating, and of course the food is delicious.  Once again, it didn't disappoint.  The food was wonderful and the atmosphere in this tiny place is just perfect.  Comfortable, quiet and calming...especially after a long day of sightseeing and shopping."}
{"text":"I was so thrilled to find Utsav is my closest restaurant when I arrived late on night to the Minto Yorkville. I LOVE their Saag Paneer. Wonderful food and lovely staff."}
{"text":"Neat little spot in Yorkville with reasonable prices. I often come here for lunch with my coworkers whenever we feel like eating some Indian food. Their lunch combos come with salad, rice and naan to go with the delicious entrees. In terms of value for dollar and taste, it's hard to find better in this area."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Indian places in Toronto. Unlike a lot of Indian restaurants, this spot doesn't really have something special that the offer, that other restaurants do not have. But you do get they're great service and they're awesome quality of Indian food. We had a couple of different curries and every single one of them were amazing. The spice level was great, and the quantity was reasonable. The naan was very delicious, especially their garlic naans. 
It is a very tiny, and cute Indian restaurant that is perfect for a date. Very subtle and calm environment unlike most Indian restaurants. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My go to place for Indian cuisine when I need lunch and a break from the office, Butter chicken, salad, rice and naan for $11.00. Very reasonable sized portions."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Service was nice. Delivery was fast- about 45 mins. Food was hot and good.

Was not as good as my favourite Indian restaurant (which is not in TO.) My husband didn't love the butter chicken but I thought it was pretty good. He doesn't want to order it again and I'm happy to keep looking for better options for us and our preferences. Still thought it deserved 4 stars, but it won't be a regular place for us. Husband didn't think it was great.

If you've never been I'd still say it's worth a try! Lots of good reviews so it depends on your preferences. Hope to find an Indian delivery restaurant that we love!"}
{"text":"Their butter chicken is so so so weird. Its less creamy and buttery than what I'm used to, and very strangely sweet. Almost as if they add honey or some type of sweetener. And the sauce is more of a tomato sauce than cream sauce...It really throws me off and uh, no thanks, wont order ever again. I understand that different regions in the India have their variations on Butter Chicken - but the one at Utsav is not to my preference, too sweet and tomatoey. 

Their chickpea masala is over salted and unremarkable.


I've called ahead multiple times to place pick up orders and nine times out of ten, they always make me wait as if they just begin making the dish when I walk through the door.

Meh. Gave it a few chances and wont be returning when there are better Indian joints around the corner."}
{"text":"Delicious, lots of vegetarian options, very accommodating to my food allergies.  Highly recommend a mushroom dish - never encountered it in any other Indian restaurant and not to be missed here!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday night, only one other table was there. Which consisted of 4 people if i remember correctly. Looked like they ordered food and received it. I've heard good things about this place. Since I couldn't get a spot at another restaurant came here.

Usually food is a higher importance to me but Customer Service is very important to me as well as I've been in the industry for years now. We sat down (2 of us). Given water promptly and menus. Great. We're ready to order, we put our menus down, close them. International sign for \"we're ready to order\", few minutes pass. Two guys are chatting at the front counter, occasionally looking at us. 15 minutes pass after putting our menu down. I stare him in the eye, he looked at me twice and looked away. I'm absolutely livid, i've never experienced anything like this. 

I go up to ask him, at this point being frustrated \"How long do you guys wait before taking our order\", he just says \"Yeah\" and just gets back on the phone. I couldn't believe it. Restaurant only had 1 other party. With two servers, and we waited around 20 minutes to get served after menus were given to us. I left immediately and went to Paramount around the corner. Got better service by a \"chain\" restaurant. Thats how you do things right. 

I usually don't write yelp reviews, but hopefully the owner sees this and can fix this issue. Then maybe i'll give them a second chance. (This happened on June 18, 2017 @ around 7pmish?)"}
{"text":"A small neat restaurant in the middle of Toronto downtown. They have super affordable lunch menu. And the quantities are large. A 10$ would fill you up for lunch :)
The food is tasty and the service is attentive. It is a busy place during lunch and you might not get a spot if you have not reserved a table in advance. Good for take outs even."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly, Utsav claims the title for favourite Indian restaurant in Toronto. This is also my favourite restaurant by far in Yorkville. 

This quaint restaurant is tucked under a small flight of stairs right at the mouth of Yorkville avenue. 
Your typical meal starts out with a delicious complimentary appetizer- Papadum. Papadum is a lentil cracker with black lentil flour and masala spices. This appetizer comes with chutneys of jam and mint to dip in. 

I really love the ambience of this restaurant. It's cozy and endearing. The restaurant is family run and the owner is extremely courteous and accommodating. 

My favourite dish is the shrimp malai curry with mild cashew cream sauce. This dish just melts in your mouth: a potpourri of sweetness, umami, delicate seasoning and all things good in life. I never leave the restaurant unhappy after eating this dish. 

I would also recommend the Sag Paneer (cottage cheese smothered in seasoned and tempered spinach) and Lamb Khorma. 
The curry is way more than enough for one person, especially if you order Nan and rice with it. 

The only caveat of this restaurant is that it is small, with seating for only maybe 20-25 people. 
Make sure to get reservations if you are coming here for weekends."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Butter chicken, never my preference, was actually rather decent - not too sweet.  Tikka masala was better.  Could I have the butter chicken pieces with the tikka masala sauce?  That would combine the best of both worlds.  Matar paneer was a bit skunky and chalky, heavy on the peas, and the saag paneer was solid.  Everything was just a little spicy - which is nice from a Toronto Indian restaurant.  Be warned though, everything is puréed to the max."}
{"text":"Their butter chicken is very good! My colleagues said their lamb is not bad as well. Lunch special is from $9.50-$11.50 (come with naan + rice) - very good deal! consider it is located in Yorkville. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very nice family ran restaurant.  The service is very hospitable.  The food is very good, and rich.  Most of the dishes are pretty standard Indian cuisine.  Nice amount of heat on some of the dishes.  

The decore is plain, but pleasant.  Wines are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Cozy, intimate restaurant in Yorkville.  My spice tolerance is pretty bad so for people like me, I would recommend the shrimp malai curry. It was creamy and delicious with just a hint of spiciness. Our meal came with complimentary papadam along with a couple chutneys which were pretty tasty. For dessert I got the Gulab jamun which was a tad too sweet for my taste. From what I remember, the dishes were fairly priced too."}
{"text":"Talk about disappointing 

Had a meal here a week back, a birthday treat. The venue was my idea; By the end, I insisted on paying cause I could not imagine making anyone else pay for such a mistake. 

The chips that came before the meal were stale. And the preserves to go with were gummy instead of jelly- clearly not fresh.

We had the butter chicken and the cauliflower (vegetarian) dish. Both were tasteless. The naan was also sans flavour. 

We even tried to send back the butter chicken at the waitress's insistence. It came back tasting exactly the same. 

Those of you saying this is the best Indian in Toronto, please... Step away from the Yorkville bubble and explore your city. Indian town (Leslieville/Gerard st), Brampton and Sauga, some pockets of downtown, and even midtown (Yeg and davisville) have so much more flavour to offer in terms of south Asian cuisine. I may have to start a Yelp list cause clearly people don't know???

I will go as far as to say that I have NEVER had a butter chicken I did not enjoy on some level... I mean never and nowhere... before Utsav's. It was so bland, chicken and stew, that I took it home and fixed it to just make it passable. Still wouldn't have served that to anyone myself.

Caveat- The service was good but I have to insist on one star because the food is a sham."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself was small (seats ~30) and a bit cramped, but everything was and bright and clean.

I got the butter chicken lunch special for $9.95, which included:
- a small salad (disliked the dressing)
- 8 pieces of warm, chewy naan
- butter chicken with 7 pieces of chicken
- rice

Not the best butter chicken I've ever had, but still very good, especially once the value is taken into account."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant so I would highly recommend a reservation, but it is very worth a visit. When you enter the restaurant, the aroma is particularly inviting. We were a larger group, but were seated promptly. The food is delicious and very appropriately spiced. My partner enjoyed the butter chicken and the biriyani for the table was excellent. Samosa and pakora were also quite good."}
{"text":"Four of us ventured out on a cold winters night in search of some spicy food to warm our cooling bodies. One of our party had been to Utsav previously and recommended we give it a try. 
The restaurant itself has a warm feeling to it. Although very small, it's very comfortable and not once did we feel \"crammed\" into our table.

We ordered:
Paneer Archari (Cheese pieces in a Masala sauce)
Channa Masala (Chick peas in a spicy sauce)
Gosht Biryani (Basmati rice with Lamb and Saffron)
Basmati Rice (white rice)
Chicken Tikka Masala (Chicken in a spicy Masala/Tomato sauce)
3 beers
1 Diet Coke
2 Earl Grey Tea
1 Coffee

The food was very tasty, with the Gosht Biryani being the 5 star dish and the Channa Masala being the 1 star dish (while it was good, it was far from spicy). The CTM was good, but I've tasted better at other Indian restaurants. PA was good. 

One member of our group who claimed to love Indian food, turned beet red from the heat of the dishes and went through 4 fairly large glasses of water (plus a beer). She found the food to be spicy. The other 3 of us thought that it lacked heat and the depth of flavours that Indian Food is known for.

So, in summary, a decent little place in Yorkville. If I was in the neighbourhood I would likely dine here again....but I wouldn't drive downtown just to go here.

Waitstaff were very friendly and unobtrusive. They raise the standard for smiles that other restaurants seem to be lacking.

Only real issues were the tea and coffee. Coffee was instant and the water for the tea was tepid (which competed ruins a decent cupper).

Dinner for 4, with drinks and tax came to $92.02"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

The Tika masala, spinach paneer and goat currie are good options. The butter chicken is also very tasty. 

It was different from the other Indian restaurants I've been to though. They don't serve the curries in the steel bowl. They serve the curries in a regular porcelain bowl. The rice didn't taste that great though. Good quality balsamati rice goes a long way for a good meal with curry. The naans tasted great though. I generally liked the curries we got for the table. 

LAST TIP?!

If you order the masala tea, it doesn't taste like masala tea. It tasted like regular black tea with milk inside so i wouldn't bother trying it. Just focus on trying the curries!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, small business owner. The menu is small but the essentials are available."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some coworkers. Good thing we had a reservation because there aren't that many tables. Small menu but nice selection. Server was helpful and explained what the non-English words were. Things are served family style. Food was really tasty. They were good about topping up our water too. Prices reasonable for the area. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Indian restaurant. All the food we picked was fantastic admittedly we didn't go too far from the standard favorites; Lamb curry, Chicken Tiki Masala, Somosas. I've eaten Indian hundreds of times so I think I know a place that should be rated highly. The only thing holding me back was the restaurant itself. We sat in the back close to the kitchen and small bar area and the heat was oppressive - granted it was a hot night by Toronto's standards but we were the furthest away from the floor fan that was by the front door. I was ready to jump up and leave by my last mouthful to be sure but the food was exquisite!"}
