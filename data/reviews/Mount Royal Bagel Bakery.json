{"text":"Personally did not like it, the place wasn't very inviting the chairs were still on top of the tables in the middle of the day. I just tried sesame bagels because I expect they would be fresh out of the oven. They were pretty dry and was just thinking the whole point of going to a bagel shop is to get fresh bagels and maybe even warm ones out of the oven. Maybe I will give it another change on a Saturday morning"}
{"text":"Great kosher bagels. Lots of different flavours to choose from. Regular,all dressed, cinnamon raisin, blueberry, chocolate, jalape√±o (not often), flax, spelt,... And more  I especially like the cream cheese dips. Plain, chives, olive, smoked  salmon (would be a Kosher bagel place with out this :)  My favourite is honey vanilla.. Free coffee every Monday."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim. Won't be going back.   These guys either don't care or haven't heard about first impressions. The person serving me was hella-surly and seemed annoyed that I was there.  The bagels were average at best, but when I can go virtually anywhere else and get St. Viateur/Fairmont bagels instead, there's no point schlepping over here. Oh, and the most disappointing thing was the chive cream cheese. I was excited because it's my favourite type, but I shit you not, it was watery! How do you make watery cream cheese? Also, $4 for a bagel and cream cheese? Seriously?! Literally anywhere else in the area will make one for under $4, even though none of these spots even make their own bagels. Overall disappointment, but lesson learned."}
