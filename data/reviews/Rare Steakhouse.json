{"text":"We had a client dinner here in The Boardroom and it was great. It was a beautiful room with a great atmosphere. The service was excellent!  We had appetizers and cocktails and dinner and we were there for at least 4 hours. We never felt rushed and Ryan our server was impeccable, he knew our names and had good suggestions as well. He jumped in the conversations when appropriate and was fun. He had an assistant who also made sure things were cleared away and refilled as needed.  The manager come by a few times just to chat, again we were never made to feel rushed. The food was also excellent. As a Wisconsin girl living in Chicago, I love steak and a appreciate a good one. The burrata, assorted cheese plate and lump cakes cakes were also delicious. The lobster Mac and loaded hash browns were great sides. Everyone on out group was very pleased. I will definitely be back when I am in town."}
{"text":"Took a small group here for lunch on Friday, and was amazed at the slow, slow service. It didn't help when the four women in our group were seated and waiting forever for someone to take our drink order, and the guy in our group (who was running a few minutes late) was met by the bartender who made a point of coming around from the bar to take his order before he even sat down. Really?

Food was only okay. Lobster in the lobster roll was served far too cold, and the dense bun is nothing like the soft, buttery buns for a real lobster roll. Friends approved of the lobster bisque and a chicken salad sandwich, but the long wait for simple food was a huge turn off.

Good place for happy hour, but by this time, they should have their service problems figured out."}
{"text":"In town for a major conference and wanted to take a group of folks out for a nice steak dinner. Very disappointed that this is the place we went. I read the reviews that said service is slow, but this was ridiculous. Arrived at 7:30 for our reservation and did not get our main course until 10:30pm. To make things worse, all of the steaks were not cooked properly, and were like-warm when they came to the table. All of the sides were also warm not hot. The service was terrible as well. The manager came by the table one time to apologize, but as soon as our server found out we were getting frustrated he disappeared. At one point no one came by the table for 45 minutes. With all of the issues, there was no apology and no offer to try to make things right. When 8 people are spending nearly $1000 on dinner, I expect MUCH more. Look for other options in Madison."}
{"text":"We went to Rare Thursday evening. We are from out of town so didn't know what to expect. The atmosphere is old school steak house, dark with lots of leather and wood. It's nice. The drinks, appetizer, steak, and sides were very good. I'm a tough grader and I would give it all a solid four stars. The chocolate cake should get five stars though. It was outstanding. 

But what motivated me to write this review was our server, Jahar. He was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, all the things you appreciate in a server, but on top of that I felt like I was watching a really fine theatrical performance. With his voice and presence he could easily be on the stage. We were tempted to ask him to repeat the specials as a sort of encore. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"I took my wife to Rare for our anniversary on a Saturday recently. There was a very small crowd in the restaurant and the bar around 7:00 PM. We ordered a filet and a New York strip with blue cheese crumbles, brussels sprouts and hash brown potatoes.

Both steaks were cooked to our request and arrived at the appropriate time to our table. The downside was they were extremely salty. I am guessing they use a lot of butter when preparing them. The brussels sprouts were nicely charred and tasted very good, but were on the salty side as well. The hash brown potatoes were the delicious. I highly recommend the Bananas Foster prepared table side. That was the highlight of the meal. Back to the saltiness of the meal. Later that evening into the next day, we couldn't drink enough water due to the salty taste of the meal.

Now on to the service. This place knows how to take care of customers! The staff from top to bottom is friendly, attentive and striving to please. The bartender made an exquisite gimlet from my direction and then remembered it when we were at our table. Our table manager was interested in us and the occasion and did here best to enhance our experience. The table staff cleared the table quickly and engaged us while he did. I would be tempted to come back just for the service.

I have to give it three stars overall. Considering the steaks, I probably would not come back as there are better steakhouses in Madison. Considering the service, I may want to live there. Considering the bananas foster, I could die happy there!"}
{"text":"Service was great, the wait staff was very attentive and constantly filling our waters. However, for such an expensive restaurant, I would say the food was very average. I probably won't go back, my expectations fell short."}
{"text":"We went to dinner the night before New Year's Eve; my wife and I ordered drinks. The place is a bit stuffy, waiter pushing apps and specials very aggressively. After our drink my wife was not feeling well, I explained to our waiter the situation and you would have thought I ran over his dog. Said nothing and dropped the bill on our table, not a \"sorry your not feeling good\", or \"hope you feel better\". Very rude, will not be back, in Madison if you want a good steak and fine service Tornado Room or Jonny D. Last word to Management \"get over yourselves \"-"}
{"text":"Hard to find any wrinkles.  Outstanding experience.
1.  Wine list is, hands down, best in Madison.  They have several reasonably-priced, nice bottles as well.  
2.  For those who say this is too pricey, I'd say it's on par or even less expensive than Tornado.  $23 for a very nice 6 oz filet is reasonable. Salads and sides are big enough to share.  
3.  Service was good.  Our server was a little over-zealous, but very professional.
4.  I love the ambiance.  It fits great for the Capitol Square.  Some great, private rooms that would work well for business group dinners.

I thought it was fantastic.  Nice job Rare!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a steak after the football game on Saturday and decided to try Rare Steakhouse. Nice place, quite fancy, with very good service. Food was good with a few problems, one of the baked potatoes was not completely cooked and the NY strip, ordered medium well, was well done, without a hint of pink. Other than that, the food was very good. Would try again, but at these prices, I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I made a trip to Rare for a special night out and had a wonderful time! The whole experience felt like an old school steak restaurant; very traditional and a bit counter to the \"granola crunchy\" atmosphere that you find in Madison. We found it very refreshing. 
   The food was very rich and decadent, featuring delicious steaks. It wasn't the absolute best steak I've ever had, but the service was without compare. Our server, Owen, knew his wines, provided excellent meal suggestions, and was a true example of someone taking tremendous pride in their work. 
     Rare is most definitely worth a visit, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Rare twice this week. The Filet was outstanding and Bananas Foster for dessert - what a treat!  Service was very good both times.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's the last impressions that matter.  Low-grade mass-produced ice cream for your signature dessert dish... in the Dairy state???   Eleven hours and a night's sleep after leaving the restaurant, and I'm still upset about dessert.  More on that below...

Overall my first experience with Rare was inconsistent at best.  Some high highs, some low lows, and enough \"meh\" to not warrant the pricetag.  Open for just 2 months so far, I hope they continue to refine, because I really, really wanted to love this place.

Highs:
+Beautiful old-school Chicago steakhouse feel
+Wine list is amazing; can stand up to any big city restaurant
+Crab cakes and pork belly appetizers were both outstanding
+Tableside Caesar salad is the best Caesar salad I've ever had - dressing is not too heavy and the croutons were amazing
+Table service strategy of having a table Captain and assistant was spot-on, with the right amount of attention

\"Meh\":
+Steaks - our table of 4 ordered 3 steaks - all dry aged; my husband and I shared the Tomahawk Chop - an impressive looking piece of meat, but was prepared medium rare (warm red), not medium (warm pink, as described & requested).  We all agreed we had had better steaks elsewhere.
+Sides - we ordered the steamed broccoli, vegetable of the day (zucchini and cherry tomatoes), Yukon Pave, and Duck Frites.  Our friends enjoyed both forms of potatoes, but I thought the Yukon Pave was served a little cold, and my husband and I both agreed we'd had better frites in town.
+Servers - while attentive, servers could use a little more polish 

Lows:
+Bar service was excessively slow when we ordered pre-dinner cocktails (bar was not full)
+Dessert - Rare's signature dessert, Bananas Foster prepared tableside ... with cheap, disappointing ice cream.  On top of this, we were charged for 2 orders of the dish when we had ordered one to share.  Our table Captain said he had brought two boats in which to serve the dessert to make it easier to share, but then he charged us for both.  When I questioned it, he paused - as if I was in the wrong - but agreed to take one off the bill. 

Now let's get down to the butterfat.  As our table Captain prepared our Bananas Foster, I asked who makes the ice cream  - wondering if it's one of the many local sources of wonderful ice cream (Chocolate Shoppe, Sassy Cow, Babcock Hall, Purple Door, etc.), or - better yet - do they make their own?  The server replied honestly that it was \"just a Kemps product.\"  I was in shock. 

I realize I am making a big deal about ice cream.  But this IS the Dairy State.  And Rare is a high-end steakhouse on Madison's Capitol Square, trying to prove it can play with the Big City steakhouses.  They source their dry aged steaks from Chicago, and mentioned the ingredients from the soup and vegetable of the day were all sourced from the farmers market on the Square.  And yet someone made the very poor decision to serve grocery-store ice cream with its signature dessert to seemingly save a few bucks.  When done right, the ice cream in Bananas Foster should melt into a creamy pool of wonder, swirling with caramel.  But the lack of butterfat meant that was lost, and the empty \"ice\" flavor in this mass-produced ice cream was NOT successfully covered with the gooey wonder of caramelized butter and brown sugar.  So very disappointing.

This cheap decision was a slap in the face after spending so much on the rest of the experience.  Our table of 4 spent $450 on four courses, a bottle of wine, cocktails and espressos - not unreasonable for a big city steakhouse, but still a pretty penny.  If there is a next time, I'll save the $10 and walk down the street for REAL Wisconsin ice cream..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the wait staff was very rude, inattentive, and our meal, which came from a preset menu during restaurant week (only three selections available) took upwards of an hour and forty five minutes to get. Talked to the wait staff about how long it took and was not offered any compensation (not even an apology for the wait being so long). Food was fantastic it was just a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We ate at Rare last night. We were celebrating a birthday with friends from out of town. I must tell you I normally don't post reviews bad or good! But I was compelled to tell everyone how Great this experience was! From our bartender Genevieve to Gabe our server and I have to mention the front of the house manager! This was probably the best dinning experience I have ever had in my life! (45 years) lol. Not only me but my guest said the same! Fun people and OUTSTANDING food and cocktails! Not to mention the beautiful night time view of the Capitol from our table. It's not cheap but you definitely get what you pay for! We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Here on business.  The food was well prepared.  This is one of the better steak houses that I have been too in the last couple of months.

I enjoyed the steak cooked perfectly medium rare, it was rested the apropriate amount of time - came to me perfect."}
{"text":"Very long wait even though they were not busy. I expected more based on price. Some items were not available, soup was lukewarm not warm enough and the $67 steak was very much marbled. 
Staff was friendly and tried to make up for what was lacking."}
{"text":"We have been to Rare in the past, and it was an amazing meal. We decided to go again during restaurant week for dinner.

I called last week and made a reservation for 8pm. We got seated shortly after 8, and the staff helped us pick out a bottle of wine. When they didn't think we were showing as much enthusiasm as they like to see, they brought us something else to try. We tried it, and ended buying a bottle of the  the Colome Malbec, it was very good. It was great to have help when picking out expensive wine. 

We ordered the crab cakes and mushroom bisque for appetizers. Very good, the soup was delicious and not over salted like most restaurant soups. For the main course, we both got the filet and potatoes, with a side of the duck fat frittes. All the food was delicious, a top rated place, and the best steaks I have ever had. They really do melt in your mouth. They cook to your specifications and want to be sure it is the way you like it.  For dessert, we had the berries and cream, and the cheesecake. Both were quite delicious as well. The food deserves 5 stars! 

The disappointing part of the evening came towards the end when we asked the waiter to space out the dessert from the main course. He pretty much ignored the request and the dessert was brought out. When he asked if that was spaced out enough, we simply stated we would eat it slowly. We still had about 2 glasses of our wine to finish.  Then, before we could finish our desserts, we were asked to move. It was a very strange request. It wasn't even 9:30, so we hadn't over stayed our time, and the place was beginning to slow down, but it wasn't closed. There were other tables, but no one was waiting for our booth.

The waiter made the request and then said he could set us up at he bar with complementary cocktails. Eventually, when the check was taken care of, we were escorted to the bar and given a card with an IOU of a free dessert instead. I really wasn't interested in scoring a free dessert or cocktail, but rather enjoying the meal we had paid for, and all the other additions we made to the restaurant menu, like a nearly $60 bottle of wine. 

 When I went to the restroom a few minutes after being asked to move, there were tables in the dinning area were finishing their meals, and the waiter we had was still attending to other tables, but the night had slowed, and there weren't other new customers in many booths. I don't really understand why we were asked to move. We finished our wine at our leisure in the bar without a problem. 

 My partner was far more understanding than I was, but It made the experience very weird.  It was far more like an Applebees where the goal is to get you fed and move you out, rather than a 4 star place where you enjoy the meal and the flavor of wine and food. :("}
{"text":"Paid $65 for a medium well ribeye with more burn than a ginger in new mexico. Seriously could have paid $15 at fareway and made this in the backyard better. Service was top notch however, 
Jose was awesome."}
{"text":"What do you say about a place where when the main front of the house icon like sara jane remembers you by name and then leaves you a note apologizing for not being there but sets up everything u ask for so that the 58th anniversary of two people you care for very much goes off perfectly. 2nd you get an over the top amazing Captain like Genevieve who goes way above and beyond her duties to insure that your drinks, food , and comfort levels are all perfect and actully potions out your appetizers so you never have to stop your conversations or have a break in your dining experience not to mention that her back up staff were flawless. I CALL THAT AMAZING. Thank you for conceiving the concept of your establishment and bringng it from paper to reality. Your food and especially your staff make you the best around. We shall see you again soon"}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced and terrible service. Bartenders were inattentive, had to wait so lo g for my order that I eventually cancelled it and left. Would not go back."}
{"text":"This is simply the best dining experience in the Midwest. Dry aged beef in the style of the 19th century, and what has to be the biggest wine list in Wisconsin. What sets Rare apart, however, is the service. I have been to The Cloister in Sea Island, and Skibo in Scotland, and none compares to the personalized experience you get at Rare in Madison.

You must go. And bring your gold card!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal restaurant. 

I came to visit a friend and she introduced me to this culinary gem. Our waiter, Jose, was absolutely stellar and the food was impeccable. The foie gras and pork belly is as delicious as your imagination can envision. I will definitely be returning to their establishment again."}
{"text":"This was hands down one of the best meals of my life. They have an amazing wine selection, so you can't go wrong there. I had the crab cakes appetizer and they were the best I've ever had. Also I would recommend the Caesar salad that they make at your table for you and ask them to put their bacon on it... Another best of my life, and our server was awesome. The steak was amazing, the filet was great with mushrooms and the one bite potatoes are so delicious. Basically I don't think you can go wrong here, I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a great meal and don't mind spending a little more."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. I think it took over 40 minutes to get appetizers after ordering, and the place was absolutely empty. Once we did get food, it was only ok, not great (at our table we had a mix of things, fish, steak, salads, etc). Given the prices I would expect a high level of food and service, neither of which we received. There are many restaurants within walking distance where you can get much better food, and infinitely better service.

To get into more of the details:

All the steaks we had were good, can't fault them there.

fish: salmon was overcooked, and I would say overpriced

beef bourguignon: incredibly salty, I have a feeling no one tasted this before it went out

Sides were ok, nothing special. What stand out in my mind was how bad the oysters rockafeller were. Just so dry and lacking flavor.

Given the service and the subpar food, I highly doubt we'll be back. The place looks nice, someone obviously dropped a lot of money on it, but it's just trying to hard. If you're going to spend all that money on leather and wood, spend some training your staff to keep service at a high level."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Rare start to finish.  Andy and Luke were friendly, attentive, funny, and yet non-intrusive.  Tuna poke app was fresh and light.  Tableside prepared Caesar was fresh and delicious with a deep rich flavor in the dressing. Steaks were some of the best I've ever had, definitely best in Madison.  10oz filet and husbands Kansas City strip were perfectly cooked with a nice crust and seasoning.  Bearnaise and mushroom accompaniments were worth it.  Hash browns and Brussels sprouts with nueskes bacon were to die for!  Finally, the bananas foster prepared at your table was phenomenal.  A wonderful place to celebrate anything!  $$$$ but worth every penny."}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 the other night and had a great experience at Rare. Fantastic service (which can be rare in a college town) and great food.  We took our time and were never rushed by the staff. Steaks were cooked perfectly and the swordfish was just right.
There are several steakhouses in Madison, but Rare is clearly the best."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks ago for the first time for my boyfriends birthday. Everything was perfect, request Tom as your server. Also, Jim the manager, was great! Super accommodating. Overall, everything was wonderful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A few months ago, I met some friends at this location, and the service was beyond extraordinary. I wish I could remember the bartenders name, but he was incredible. A couple of my friends and I were there during a street fest. Our bartender gave us great directions in how to find the bar that we were to continue on to, but later realized I forgot my credit card at his restaurant. This man actually walked to the bar and brought me my credit card. It seems like a small and easy thing to do, but it's not common. The food was perfect, it's always nice when the service is the same. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for restaurant week. Loved the decor and ambience, gleaming wood, crystal, and organized quite well for separate more private areas. Had lunch, in and out in 40 minutes with 3 courses. Great. Appetizer was disappointing. Salmon nachos. Sounded awesome, but taste was not there. Very little salmon, the caviar was sadly tasteless, the biggest flavor you got was wasabi. I think if they had used tuna instead of salmon it would have been better. The entree however was wonderful. I had the salmon, and asked for rare. It was perfect, seared outside, rare inside and well seasoned. Excellent. I was surprised that the cassoulet underneath was almost as good as the salmon. Full of flavor, cooked just right. Dessert I chose the macaroons. Strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla fillings. Cookie parts were all the same. They were not typical macaroons, but they were quite tasty. Service was good. Great experience overall. I would go back."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for...and I can honestly say...I've never had a better steak, crab cake or better service anywhere. Wine list is rediclously vast and impressive.  The atmosphere was also amazing.  For your next special occasion, do yourself a favor and go to rare."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience. Loved our waiter Owen. Food and presentation was fantastic and the entire experience was awesome. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Truly one of the best steak houses in Madison and the state.   I was lucky enough to have been included in a family birthday celebration in Rare Steakhouse's Boardroom.  A nice quiet room greatly suited for a birthday celebration.
Our group started off with a selection of a few appetisers.  I really enjoyed the crab cakes and the Oysters Rockefeller.  Both had loads of flavor.  We then continued on with salads.  Our server (Jahar Glover) did a beautiful job of making Caesar Salads table side.  A beautiful performance hard to top (but her did later).   Our group ordered a variety of steaks and main dishes including Wine Braised Short Ribs, that I can only say not a bad word was voiced.  Each was done to perfection.  my filet was mouth watering and very tasty.  It is unfortunate that they feel the need to charge $4 for blue cheese sprinkled on top.  Along with our meal we shared orders of Brussel Sprouts, Duck Fat Frites, and Rare Hash Browns.  All of which where delightful. it was nice to see the sides served family style.   Our waiter was also very helpful when it came to selecting a nice red wine to compliment our meal.  With over 400 bottles to pick from a little help was welcomed. 
And then we come to dessert.   After having eaten way too much, and birthday cake to come later, we opted for an order of Bananas Foster to be shared.  Waiter Jahar Glover out did his earlier performance in preparing the Bananas Foster tableside.  Starting out by making caramel from butter and brown sugar and then adding the bananas and finally setting the liqueurs aflame.  It was fitting end to a wonderful meal and celebration.  
(Our only regret was having spent too long looking for parking only to realise they offer valet parking.  Would be nice to have that noted on their website.)"}
{"text":"Came back for restaurant week after a great experience last year-- this experience was very different. We sat for over an hour before our appetizer came. The service was poor and barely tended to our table. During a time with a limited menu I expected better speed and service. Food was delicious but not worth the experience. The restaurant was not even at capacity and we were never given an apology. When boxing up our dessert a second one was even forgotten."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks in town. Service is top notch and the drinks are perfectly made. Would recommend Rare to anyone looking for a special evening made even better."}
{"text":"We came here with another couple for Restaurant Week. We actually had a debate over dessert what the appropriate rating would be. Since yelp doesn't allow 1/2 star rating, we are sticking with three.

Let me preface this by saying we had been drooling and studying the restaurant week menu since it was released. Perhaps our hype overclouded reality.

The three of us ordered the crab cake appetizer with the broiled filet, the rogue at the table went with the 10 oz top sirloin  and duck fat frites. Three of us ordered our steaks medium well, and one medium. 

The crab cakes were divine! I wish they had crafted a entree around the crab cakes instead. There were almost no traces of breadcrumbs or otherwise fillers found in typical, lower grade crab cakes. It was not deep fried, but instead lumped together into a perfect dollop portion with a side of aioli. 

Each of the steaks arrived on a clean, thick plate, sitting atop a bed of mashed potatoes, dressed with au jus, and shaved asparagus and baby Portobello mushrooms.

The medium filet came well done, not the slightest indication of pink, it was an unappetizing gray throughout. Upon notifying our waiter, he was quick to remove the offender right away, no questions asked. Not 10 minutes later, another filet, cooked to the desired redness was brought out. However, this one had a very thin spread of mashed potatoes under the steak, and hardly any garnishments of asparagus nor mushrooms.

The filet was done well, a seared glaze of salt adorned the outside, and the flavor accentuated to the inside of the cut as well. The potatoes had a more pureed consistency, reminiscent of instant potatoes, but these clearly had better flavor, and were obviously not instant, but that's what the consistency reminded me of.

The sirloin had fat and gristle intertwined through the meat, 10 oz or not, the edible part of the meat dwindled to a much lower serving size. 

The duck fat frites were sadly the clear favorite of the second course. Each humble potato were soaked in rich, fatty, flavor, yet maintained a golden, crisp shell. Lightly sprinkled with grated Parmesan, they were served with a side of aioli. 

Not sure if it was because we ordered from the Restaurant Week menu, but there were no bread basket offered. It made the transition between appetizer to the main course seem longer than it had to.

The decision to give it three stars did not come lightly, they do deserve some recognition for our servers and staff. Our water glasses were never empty and the overcooked steak problem was handled professionally, thought they did not make any adjustments to the bill. 

It was very disappointing considering how many other steakhouses are within a close radius of Rare, with a less steep price point.

Not sure if they were just in a dither over the Restaurant week frisk rush, but we did observe some odd antics by some of the other servers and bussers. A table of two women sitting across from us in the large booth had a rather intrusive staff stand right next to their table and almost gesturing for another table to join them, leaving the women to comment, \"what just happened?\". There were sounds of dropped plates and aluminum covers over the steaks collapsing in the dining room and just staff blatantly socializing among their cohorts in view of the diners. For an establishment with $$$$ next to their name, I expected better dining quality in both the food and overall restaurant."}
{"text":"I opened the Ruth Chris Steakhouse in Chicago (AGM) back in the early 90's so I know a bit about what a Chicago Steakhouse should represent.  The service needs to shake out the cobwebs a bit, they are still working out kinks and timing.  They will nail it after a bit, but they still need additional training and tighter standards.  The décor is fantastic, absolutely beautiful.  Steaks were excellent, although they were a tad off on the temp.  I like rare steak so I was fine, but it would have been a challenge for those ordering medium (it was medium rare minus).  The order their dry aged steaks from Chicago via the best location, so quality is not at issue for the product.  Execution is key for Rare to get to top status.  It was probably a 3.5 in this outing, but I rounded up due to effort, décor, and food quality"}
{"text":"Oftentimes you get what you pay for, folks and there is no better example than Rare Steakhouse. Located on the Capital Square this place is almost blink and you'd miss it but it would be a shame if you can afford to go and miss it. Inside you will be greeted promptly the interior is luxurious and inviting without being faux steakhouse inviting. 

Everything on the menu is a la carte but you really cannot go wrong. we have been here many times and they take extreme care in making sure the food and service are impeccable. You are assigned one person that goes beyond being a server who is dedicated to your table and another who is dedicated to being a wine/drink specialist. If it goes to show you their level of wanting to give you your bang for your buck they even made our Caesar salad dressing from scratch at our table. It is a classy, tasty and comfortable dining experience. It is expensive of course so unless you resemble that guy from Monopoly this place may best be saved for special occasions."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the BEST meals I've ever had!  The restaurant itself is stunning, and the food and drinks are even better.  They have a massive wine list as well.  

Wonderful food, great experience.  Make sure you ask for Ryan as your server when making reservations - he's outstanding and made our dinner at Rare memorable, and a great learning experience!"}
{"text":"Went to Rare with the family (two adults, two teens) on a Monday night for a birthday celebration. We sat in one of the half-moon booths, which was comfortable for the four of us.

I was worried upon reading past reviews that we would be fending off pushes to buy more expensive drinks and food extras; we experienced exactly zero up-sell pressure. Instead we received solid recommendations on all parts of the food menu, all which turned out quite well.

The crab cakes are as advertised - fantastic, and I'm not a crab cakes fan. Pork belly was also recommended, and was one of only two \"just fine\" orders. Two of us split a wedge salad, the other two split a Caesar salad - which was prepared expertly at tableside. 

Steaks were fantastic. Fan. Tastic. Bone-in and boneless rib eyes, 6 oz and 10 oz filets all easily met our optimistic expectations. Side of duck frites was also tremendous - but the creamed spinach was not a wow. Next time (and there WILL be a next time) we'll try some of the other interesting-looking sides. 

Desserts of chocolate cake, bananas foster (tableside, again) and creme brulee all pleased. 

Service was outstanding - another area about which previous reviews had us worried. Would happily recommend for those willing to have a special, albeit pricey, evening."}
{"text":"Went here for Restaurant Week and everyone in my group loved it.  It was a bit pricey, but show me a restaurant with really good food in Madison that isn't.  I like this more than the Tornado Room, which I love.  I had the crab cake, which was amazing.  It was large and pretty much completely filled with crab meat.  The aioli that was with it was good.  The filet with mushroom ragout was a much bigger portion than expected and it was delicious.  It was seasoned well and perfectly cooked.  The mashed potatoes were good as well.  We ordered sides of asparagus and lobster Mac and portions were very generous and enough for the table to share.  Lobster Mac was okay.  The chocolate tart was so good that I would have rolled around in a tub of it all day long.  Others at my table ordered Caesar salads but didn't like them.  They all ordered the filet as well and pretty much licked their plates clean.  The cheesecake and mixed berries were good as well.  Our server, Ryan, was very engaging and funny.   I will definitely go here again when it's not Restaurant Week since they only had a limited menu during this time."}
{"text":"Overall our experience here was great, the service however was just alright. The brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had and my steak was very good. My husbands steak was cooked wrong both times which was a little upsetting."}
{"text":"The ambiance at Rare is nice, and is a must try if you are in the mood for a good sit down dinner in Madison. The crab cake appetizer is a must try! The salmon nachnos were alright. For dinner, our group got some of the steak options and I got the scallops. All were cooked to perfection. The offer sides family style and we got a few of them to try. My favorites were the asparagus, mashed potatoes, and mushrooms. 

I really liked their desserts. They were the perfect size after a nice meal. My reccomendation would be the creme brulee."}
{"text":"The best steak I've ever had and fantastic service. Definitely a destination for a date night or to celebrate for a special event."}
{"text":"I love this place! Came here a few times but today was special! It's our 3 year anniversary! Right away we were wished a \"Happy 3 year Anniversary\" by the wait staff! Service is always the best! I really enjoy the history lessons and how knowledgeable everyone is. The food is amazing as always! I have the Swordfish steak which was delicious! My husband had the Kansas City steak which was cooked with perfection! He ordered medium which is good but I prefer medium-rare. The juicier the better! We also had the Rockefeller Oysters which was AMAZING! I might have to come back just for those! I had the leek soup which was a bit thick for me. But very delicious! (I just didn't want to get full and wanted to have room for my swordfish so I didn't finish it) their Caesar Salad was AMAZING! We also ordered the Bananas Foster for desert! (Which is a must!) overall, our meal was delicious and the service was impeccable! I also ordered their special Manhattan drink, it was super smooth and delicious! But I couldn't really indulge in my drink because.. well, I have to still be able to function with kids! (Haha!!) anyway, I highly recommend coming here! The best times are around 1800, their dinner rush is around 1900 or so. So we were able to get a booth around that time. It's really nice that they make the salad and the Bananas Foster in front of you. Quite entertaining. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I'd give rare zero stars if yelp allowed. Awful service, and very rude staff. Go to Tornado steak house. Better food and much friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Rare steakhouse is my third favorite steakhouse in Madison. Great formal and lively atmosphere, looking very traditional. Two wait staff working as a team to serve your table. I actually come here often just to enjoy the bananas foster dessert. I come here for dinner as well occassionally. 

Rare dry ages all of their beef in house and you will usually get a piece of meat that has been dry aged between 28 and 35 days. They also note in their menu that their beef is USDA Prime and it is a part of the top 2% of the beef in the world. Writing both is redundant, as I'll explain below. This really sets expectations high and I think the meat, though good, doesn't always match the claim. I have had outstanding beef and mediocre beef coming here on separate occasions. There is a lack of consistency. 

I personally believe they should take the 2% fact off because to some respects they are shooting themselves in the foot; most people don't know that Prime beef is indeed the top 2% of beef by USDA standard and some people may develop a new level of expectation based on this accurate, but, perhaps misleading, fact . Just write that you have Prime beef. Anyways, why not impress by having consistently damn good beef instead of being redundant and falling short of expectations? Okay, I'll get off my soap box now.

The service here is always great, friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt even at peak dining hours.

As I mention above, the food is really hit or miss, and I can say this based on multiple visits. In our last visit, we ordered a dry age rib eye, Kansas city strip, filet, tomato soup, risotto, duck frites, loaded hash browns, and bananas foster for dessert.

Most of the time the meats are tender and flavorful, exactly what you would expect going to a steakhouse serving USDA Prime. There are times, however, where my steak is loaded with tough, inedible tissue, an experience that I could easily replicate by purchasing a bag of jerky from a department store.

The sides, excluding hashbrowns (these were top notch) were mediocre. The duck frites lack duck fat flavor (consistent issue on multiple visits) and were overpowered by the parmesan. The chili aioli has zero heat and rather had an Asian sweetness to it. The Risotto, well, lets just say don't get it.

My favorite and really the highlight of my visit every time is the bananas foster, made table side with a great flambe to impress patrons. If I am on the square, I will come here for dessert only because the foster is THAT good. The sauce and bananas are served over three scoops of rich vanilla bean ice cream. Cant go wrong and possibly the top reason I give Rare four stars.

Very enjoyable, but, not the best steakhouse in Madison."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We went during restaurant week which had a limited menu.  I had the seafood risotto and it was fabulous.  Husband had broiled fillet mignon and it was melt in your mouth. Jahar was excellent and were enjoyed our night!"}
{"text":"Why isn't this place 5 stars? 

To see this joint at 3 stars is crazy. Am I missing something here? Let me see if I can break this down and my experience was sitting at the bar for dinner. 

1. Professional Service with Old Style Captains available to assist the servers to make your dining experience more enjoyable. Only the classiest places have Captains. 

2. The decor is drop dead gorgeous. Someone dropped a lot money in this place and it looks spectacular. The woodwork alone would probably drain most of our bank accounts. Plus it's right in the square. 

3. The food is top notch man. I'm not going to bore you with all the great steak joints I've eaten at. I find that annoying. I will tell you that food was outstanding. As with all high class joints everything is Ala Carte. That issue, the US prime meats they are serving and the new decor sets this apart from Tornados.  My filet was cooked perfect medium and if you don't believe me look at my picture. You could taste the quality of the meat and no steak sauce was required. It cut like soft butter man. The scalloped potatoes I got as a side were extremely tasty. Broiled perfect and it was a nice portion. I also had the creamed spinach. Not to shabby but it wasn't the best I've ever had.

4. Happy Hour. This happy hour was pretty sweet. My wife had the French Dip which was on this menu. she loved it along with the 5 buck wines. We also got the cheese plate which was also only 5 bucks.

Verdict 

Am I living on the moon to give this place 5 stars? You folks in Madison have some damn good places to eat at and I will be shocked that if in time this place doesn't end up being the best in your town. When I'm sitting in my shorts, flip flops and T-shirt by my pool in January in South Florida someone will have to give me an update on this place. Stay Hungry!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for his birthday in February and LOVED it! We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and asked to take out coats for us. We were shown to our table and our waiter was there seconds after we were seated to see if we would like a drink. Of course we wanted to put our drink order in right away. Only took a few minutes to get our drinks and our waiter started telling us their specials for the evening. I was wanting lobster that night but it was only on the enhancement menu. Our waiter said it was no problem to order the lobster tail and that they were about 7-10 ounces in size. We had the Oysters Rockefeller for our appetizer and shared the wedge salad. My husband had the porterhouse and we shared the brussels sprouts and hash browns. We were both very pleased with our meals and enjoyed a wonderful bottle of red wine. They have a huge selection and a Certified Sommelier that helped pick out the perfect bottle to celebrate my husbands birthday. After dinner we enjoy a drink at the bar while they called a cab for us. We will most definitely be back and bring our friends with us next time."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best steakhouses I've been to. Menu is on the pricier end, but the food is pretty quality. Some great steaks, excellent burgers, and those duck fat fries are fantastic! On top of that, the staff was very friendly and didn't seem to mind that we ordered food 10 minutes before the kitchen closed. Great experience!"}
{"text":"The best! That is all. Delicious food, classy environment, and fantastic customer service."}
{"text":"Rare is without question one of Madison's better restaurants, but hands-down the most expensive (expect to pay $150 per person or so including tip without going overboard; $200 per person should not surprise you either). Still, you largely get what you pay for.  The decor is elegant and upscale.  For us the night started with a warm welcome and smile from Caitlyn, the hostess, who handed us off to Carly, who could well teach seminars on service excellence (smiling, informative, entertaining, and attentive; what more could you ask for?)  We started with the crab cakes, which were very good in spite of being light on the sauce, and the foie gras with pork belly. The foie gras was very good, though the pork belly could be a bit more tender.  We had three different steaks; mine was the 10 oz tenderloin, perfectly prepared, with a side of delicious chargrilled broccolini. We also ordered the cream spinach and the duck fat fries, which were both very good (all the sides are family style with plenty to share). We had a bottle of Silver Oak cabernet, which was an excellent choice. We didn't leave room for dessert, but that's just reason to come back.  And we will, because the menu has many other options we wished we could have tried."}
{"text":"Terribly slow. Took 25 minutes to get drinks more than once. Took entirely too long for the food. Waiter was kind of rude. Poke and bruschetta and duck fries were good. Steak and lobster Mac average to mediocre. Very very disappointed in rare. Tornado Room is 100x better"}
{"text":"This place made me think of an upscale New York City steakhouse with the decor.  Decor and atmosphere were awesome with the dark wood, round leather button booths, and dim lighting, and beautiful chandeliers.  Bar service was excellent, extensive wine menu, and great cocktails.  It was a classy atmosphere with big bands music and jazz playing in the background.  I felt underdressed in my jeans and button up.  The service was great.  They didn't bother you too much but kept your drinks fresh and were knowledgeable.  We went during restaurant week so but my filet was awesome-perfectly cooked and delicious.  The food overall was great but I can't speak for a regular night with a full menu.    I would no doubt frequent this place if the menu listed prices on things.  It is unfortunate that this restaurant is probably out of my league for a typical night out because it was excellent."}
{"text":"First off, I love the atmosphere of this place. It is dark but beautiful inside.

My husband and two children went here to celebrate my son's 8th birthday before Wicked at the Overture. Upon hearing this, our waiter went the extra mile to make it memorable for my son. We each ordered steaks and sides. The steaks were perfectly cooked and the sides were huge. My son got a complimentary birthday dessert that was big enough for all of us to share. Expect to pay a pretty penny, however, as it is definitely more costly than other steakhouses in Madison. For the four of us (husband, myself, 11 yr old daughter and 8 yr old son), the bill came to almost $500 without tip. But let me just say, it was well worth it!!"}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews and went in a tad skeptical. I was pleasantly surprised. Friendly, attentive staff. Great decor. Big, comfortable booths. Good drink selection. Steak was prepared well and tasted great. My wife's sea bass was excellent. Great date night dining experience!"}
{"text":"Traditional steakhouse on the capital square. Interior is leather and dark wood. I have eaten here many times, mostly for business, but occasionally for pleasure, and they do a solid job."}
{"text":"I feel sad writing this review.  Rare itself does not deserve two stars based on the incredible food and the excellent experience I had there last year.  But based on my experience at Rare this past Friday, I feel two stars is appropriate.

I made dinner reservations at 7:15pm on Friday 11/11 at Rare to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th birthday.  I was looking forward to succulent steaks and friendly, expert service.

When we arrived at Rare on Friday around 6 for our 7:15 reservation, the hostess seated our party of 4 right away, which was appreciated.  We were greeted by our server, Ryan, who provided us with menus and said he would return for our initial drink orders.  Some time later, Ryan returned and took our drink orders.  It took about 15 minutes after being seated for us to receive our first round of drinks.

After receiving our drinks, we waited again to have our appetizer and dinner orders taken.  Looking around the dining room, Ryan was serving many other parties, some of whom arrived later than we did, and he seemed to be visiting others much more frequently than he visited us.

Finally our food arrived, and it was more than fantastic.  Three of us had steaks, and I had salmon, and it was, in a word, perfect- perfectly cooked, seasoned, displayed.

However, my boyfriend's mother has a severe gluten allergy.  Before she ordered her meal, she asked for it to be made without gluten or dairy.  Our server Ryan actually had the audacity to say something to the effect of, \"gluten intolerance isn't a life-or-death situation, so I wouldn't worry about it too much!\"  Unfortunately my boyfriend's mother's gluten intolerance can cause her to have anaphylaxis if she consumes gluten, which can be life-threatening, so this was disturbing to hear.

This, and having to wait too long for service, made our Rare experience this year uncomfortable and awkward.  I was very disappointed and sad.  

We even mentioned to Ryan that we were celebrating a 30th birthday, and he did not make our celebration a priority, or even seem to care.  After we asked for our check, we waited about 15 minutes for anyone to come to our table, and there was no song or celebration of any kind on the part of Rare.  Last year at Rare, our server presented us with a dessert adorned with lit candles, and sang an original birthday song to my boyfriend.  We were expecting something similar this year, but were very disappointed.  

We will probably not be back next year."}
{"text":"\"Pop Overs\"  I won't explain those.  You'll have to experience them for yourself.  All I can say is I want more...

Had the 8 oz Filet.  One of the best steaks I've had.  Cooked the way I wanted and served with the crab cake.  Yum.....

The Belgian Red was bliss.....

A little pricey but worth every penny."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere, friendly staff.  Waiter was never told he had a table, no big deal.  Food was good but very pricey.. don't think it was worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent bartenders.  Great wine list, and glasses were very reasonably priced for Madison. Great bread and two really interesting butters - a sweet and savory. 
Only reason I can't go five stars is the lamb and lobster were unevenly cooked. But overall very good and we will be back. And plenty of nice Democrats to balance the republicans."}
{"text":"I have only been here for lunch but it was so amazing, I HAD to rate it 5 stars.  I have been here twice for business lunches and both times I've had the same thing.  The Prime Rib burger with duck frites is simply amazing.  The atmosphere is quite decadent and though pricey, it is an awesome lunch.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The steaks are SUPERB. Shared the 24oz porter house with my date. I do wish I would've asked for sauce on side. Excellent wine choices. I have to agree this is one of the best steak houses. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first visit to Rare Steakhouse and absolutely loved not only the food but also the experience. Our waitress, Carli, truly made the evening amazing with her knowledge and expertise about the entrees. With her help we were able to order some delicious crab cakes, wagyu, and a tasteful bottle of wine. We can honestly say that we've had the best steak we've ever had and the best service! This is my first yelp post ever and had to create a yelp account just to rave about our experience."}
{"text":"First time at Rare didn't go so well.

We were eating out on the patio and had had a mediocre meal. Asked the waitress for the dessert menu and she brought it, taking her time to really explain the different desserts. We were sold on the chocolate cake. She came back soon after we ordered it to bring us our forks and tell us the cake was about to be brought out. Then, she never came back.

We had to get going, so after about 35-40 minutes of waiting, we walked inside and asked the hosts for our bill, explaining we had waited forever for a slice of cake and couldn't find our waitress to ask for it or for the bill. The hosts finally tracked down the waitress (I don't know if she was on her break or what), and she offered no explanation as to what had happened. She just smiled and said she would take the cake off the bill. We weren't even given the cake in a to-go box or anything! 

It was an odd experience. My order was messed up, too (I had asked for no onions or mushrooms on my burger, but it came to me slathered in carmelized onions), but I was going to overlook that. The salad was kind of bad, too. But then the cake incident was just too much. The least they could have done was bring us the cake once we brought it to their attention that we never received it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, no long wait for food. An altogether top notch dining experience."}
{"text":"By far the best steak house in town! I had an amazing meal all around with amazing service! Overall this is a great dining expirence!"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse that I have ever eaten at! We are from Chicago which have the best restaurants, Rare Steakhouse has excellent service the best steak whipped potatoes are to die for and popovers are unbelievable ! Nice friendly staff, you have to come here"}
{"text":"Stopped here recently with a group of 12 of us. The atmosphere was very dark (which is fine for fine dining) candles on all the tables. They were able to cater to our group in a private dining area and we had a good time.

This was almost more of a production than a meal. The \"Service Captain\" who's name I believe was Jahar, did a fantastic job, and was very articulate with the wine lists, specials, steaks, etc... It was certainly a long night. 

For appetizer we had-Tuna Poke, Beef TarTar, and crab cakes. We had so picky eaters in the crowd, so the poke and tartar did not go over so well, but I thought it was fantastic.

The rolls made in house served with Sea Salt Butter and Strawberry Preserve butter was FANTASTIC (especially that strawberry butter, seems odd at first, try it, you won't regret)

The steak was good, definitely a Prime piece of meat, just wish that it had a tad more seasoning. I totally understand that they're trying to let the beef flavor speak for itself, just a personal preference thing.

Followed up with banana's foster made table side, delicious and probably could have feed 3 people with it.

All in all, with quite a few drinks, apps, soups, salads, steaks, and desserts, our bill came out to about $175 per person. (which I think most of us were expecting a bit over $200 per, so not bad at all). There was an auto gratuity of 20% for our table for the number of us. So hopefully it was worth it for Jahar to put up with our (picky) group for the $350 (seriously, someone asked for A1....). Would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week, and was quite under-whelmed.  First, be aware they do not let you \"split\" a set for restaurant week, even if you upgrade to one of the more expensive steaks that is 22 oz and more than twice the cost (e.g. $35 for restaurant week pre fixe + $45 for the 22 oz ribeye upgrade).  

Second, everything about the food was okay, not quite what you would expect from an expensive steakhouse.  My medium steak was more like medium-rare/rare, with blood oozing from the center.  The flavor was completely bland.  Mushroom and mashed potato were soggy.  Indeed, I see no quality difference from say a Longhorn Steakhouse.  

Crabcake appetizer had basically no crab, and was almost entirely mayonnaise and breading.  Dessert chocolate tart was probably the most decent out of everything, with a subtle nutty taste.  Pass on the coffee panna cotta, tasteless and boring.


Edit: Apparently Bill F. was so offended by my review he actually wrote me and called me a plebeian and told me to stay home because I wanted to split the upgrade restaurant week fare (for the record, it was another couple in our party who wanted to do that, but whatever, I don't know why it's anyone's business that it's what they wanted to do and was refused).  

I didn't like my experience at Rare. If you did, cool, write a review.  No need for name calling."}
{"text":"Shared kansas strip with guest.
Sides were pitifully small.
Steaks very average
Better steaks at Oakcrest.
Oakcrest knows how prepare a shared steak and sides."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fabulous meal in a cool space. Went here w my daughter during a mom's weekend. Made reservations thru \"open table\". Walked in and our table was ready. The food was delicious. There was fluffy rolls and homemade butter to start. My daughter had the sirloin that was perfection. I loved the salmon. Our sides were a baked potato (huge), brussel sprouts (yum), au gratin potatoes were so good too. I would definitely bring the rest of my family here. They make Caesar salads and Bananas Foster at your table. It's really cool inside. Lots of dark wood, chandeliers, and tin ceiling.  This would be perfect for large groups too because the place is very big. Staff and service was great. Our bill was $98 w tip, no alcohol."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for lunch for restaurant week. They usually don't serve lunch but they did for restaurant week. 

During restaurant week you get and app, main course, and dessert. For my app I got duck frites. Basically fries with seasoning on them. They were very good! I had Mac and cheese for the main course and it was pretty good. Not the best I've had. I had some of my girlfriends burger and that was very good and the high light of the meal. Lastly for dessert I ordered the cookies but was accidentally brought the mousse. That was fine with me because the chocolate mousse. Was very rich and tasty."}
{"text":"WOW! Magical, wonderful, fabulous, 5 star service and food!!  This was our Valentine dinner and it was fabulous. Our server, Genevieve, was very impressive. She gave us so much attention, description of the food and understands what good service is all about, plus she is a \"foodie\" so seemed to enjoy us enjoying every minute! Even gave us a tour of the kitchen and wine area. Delicous food, even the rolls and butter were to die for, crab cakes, beet salad, rib eye VERY good, the ultimate were the yukon potaotes, be sure to ask how they are made and ended with bananas foster!  Wonderful Manhattan to start with and a velvety Zin to go with our steak. You felt well taken care of, they even presented a velvet case where you could pick out your own steak knife. Only draw back was very pricey and a la carte, but, we enjoyed every bite and minute!"}
{"text":"Great service good, salads great filet. Atmosphere dark and old fashion, bar noise a little loud overall great dinner"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for Valentine's Day dinner. No traffic on the square since it was closed down for Winterfest, so the restaurant didn't seem crowded at all.

The service was very good. We were well-informed about the menu so it helped with the decision making. 

The lobster bisque was really tasty. The lobster was on top of a crouton which gave it a good crunch. I ordered the 10oz filet, cooked medium, and it was perfect. The seasoning was really delicious. My wife gave me half of her 16oz sirloin, medium rare, and she enjoyed it as well. Some parts of the sirloin seemed tough, but overall, it was tasty.

The duck fat frites were good. Nothing too extraordinary. The aioli was the star of the duo. I guess we were expecting more. We also ordered the creamed spinach, which tasted even better the next day.

Definitely not your every day dining, but really great for special occasions."}
{"text":"We went here for my boyfriends birthday and I can't even express how wonderful this restaurant was. The absolute BEST Brussel Sprouts I've ever had. 
The cocktails were insanely good - (Get the Bee's Knees one!) 
I know the dry aged steaks are more expensive, but they are SO worth it. 
The popovers they bring out could have easily been dessert in all their buttery delicious glory - put the strawberry butter on them. 
I don't even like fish but we got the Poke as an appetizer and it had such good flavor with these crisp wontons.
For dessert we got Banana's Foster, Key Lime Pie, and a chocolate tart. The experience of them making the banana foster at your table is so much fun and completely worth it.


Service was wonderful! Our waiter Andy always made sure we had what we needed without being overbearing, he gave us the privacy we wanted for our date while also making sure our drinks were never low. I kept teasing my boyfriend that I'm flying to Madison for my birthday just to eat here."}
{"text":"Poor value.
2 of 5 steaks at table significantly overcooked.  Not very flavorful and sauces mediocre.  
Vegetables sides very mediocre as well. Cauliflower side special undercooked and bland. Brussels just ok, and not very flavorful. 
Popovers, wedge salad, and hashbrowns were good.  
Service was not very attentive.  Had to track down waiter to send well-done medium rare ordered steak back.    

Won't be back."}
{"text":"I want to give them 5 stars, as the food, service and decor were indeed 5 stars. Our apps were excellent, Shrimp Cocktail & Ahi Tuna Poke. My prime dry aged ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare and my wife's scallops were outstanding, as were the sides, duck fat frites and brussel sprouts. We were much too full for dessert. Huge wine list, we both had nice reds by the glass. 

Unfortunately my Old Fashioned was 4 stars, there are several restaurants nearby with true 5 star 'craft cocktails.' 

But I couldn't round up to 5 stars overall because the pace was much too fast for a $270 dinner for two. The drinks came quickly, that's a plus. But the apps appeared too quickly, even the 'wait Captain' said \"that was fast.\" And yet the entrees came just as fast? The pace was like a fast casual chain restaurant??? We felt rushed, and there were three empty tables around us, so there was clearly no need for them to turn tables. An otherwise great dinner marred by a rushed pace - unfortunate."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday last night.  Her and I both love a good steak and were very excited to try this place out due to the great reviews we have read.  We were greeted by a very friendly gentleman in the front and were seated immediately.  It was pretty empty so the service was definitely on par!  Unfortunately the food did not live up to the hype and we left a little disappointed.

We ordered the premium platter to start (oysters, clams, shrimp, lobster, lobster salad, tuna poke, and king crab legs).  The presentation was beautiful but that was about it.  You could immediately smell the fishiness coming from the platter and nothing tasted fresh.  In fact, we were wondering if items were frozen and then thawed out.  Nothing was terrible, but for $60 it could have been better.  We also ordered the chopped salad which was delicious.  It was light and refreshing.

For our entrees we ordered the bone in rib eye and also the sea scallops.  The sea scallop dish was tasty but way too salty.  The scallops were also gritty which is a big NO NO.  I could feel sand while I was chewing.  The corn that it was on top of was delicious and crisp.  Unfortunately, we ordered the rib eye medium and it came out medium well/well done.  We weren't going to complain about it but my wife insisted that for the price we were paying we should mention it.  Our server was so nice and took it back immediately for a new one.  Sadly, by the time the new one came out (was cooked perfectly this time) we were too full to eat it.

Our server was very attentive and so apologetic about the mistake that he offered a free dessert.  We ordered the bananas foster (which is prepared table side).  This was probably one of the worst desserts we have ever had.  It was basically half a banana sitting on top of melted butter (which was supposed to be a homemade caramel).  The vanilla ice cream that it came with was good but honestly how can you screw up vanilla ice cream?  

The only reason I am leaving two stars is because the service we had was amazing.  Everyone was so friendly and knowledgeable.  BUT for a $250 meal the food was not good."}
{"text":"We came here at about 930pm Saturday night, the place is nicely decorated and we got right in. Now here is where it goes downhill. We get seated and they have a menu at our table already, didn't think much of it until the server brings us another one. We order a drink and browse through it. We want to both go with the Ribeyes, but the server tells us they are out of those and the NY and KC strips and one other thing, but  we can order the tomahawk. Well I'm not paying over a $100 for a steak that the bone weighs more than the steak itself because I've been down that road before. At that point I'd rather just finish my drink and go elsewhere. So the waiter says he will go check again and comes back to miraculously find 2 Ribeyes. Must have just been sitting around waiting to get ordered(insert sarcasm). So we take them. We try to order sides but are then told that they are only doing their restrauant weekly menu, but we can get mushrooms or onions, fine we will take the mushrooms. We did have the crab cakes and they were decent, not sure if they were $25 decent but OK. My steak was fine but my wife's was burnt, both ordered medium well but why say anything if we got the last 2 and had to go to the comedy show soon. Overall we had 5 drinks 3 for me the alcoholic and a mixer and Moscato for the lady, a crab cake appetizer and 2 Ribeyes the damage $200 not including a tip. I'm glad we tried it, but sorry to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad dinner here ever. Excellent dry aged steaks. On my list of favorites: Lobster bisque, pork belly, duck fat fries, bananas foster, even the onion rings and bread. Lucky to have this place in the steakhouse scene on Madison."}
{"text":"Super secret restaurant week review!

OK, so this was hands down my favorite Restaurant Week experience - we did lunch, 4/5 of us did Tennessee Browns (Louisville brown? it's like a shepherds pie sort of thing in a silver dish). It was AMAZINGLY good. I had been here for happy hour, but never for food, and the chefs outdid themselves.

The food was rich, without being overwhelming. Tasteful pairings, good (not boring) spice levels, and the dessert was to die for. Will definitely return to see what the chefs come up with next year.

Oh, also, our server was awesome! The staff here are great."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is a very good steakhouse because it has very good steaks, it's that simple. To become a great steakhouse they would need great sides, great desserts, and or great service. Maybe in time they will hit their stride and I hope they do because it's a beautiful restaurant in a great location."}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week a while back, and got the $35 pre fixed meal. The steak was amazingggggggg. I got medium rare and man was it perfectly juicy and delicious! This place is definitely pricy on a normal day, but the restaurant week deal was too sweet to miss! If you want to splurge on a delicious steak, definitely come here."}
{"text":"Overall great food and experience. The Old Fashions were outstanding. 

Three at my table had steak; I had scallops. Two steak eaters were blown away by their steaks. The third steak eater was displeased with the amount of fat on the bone-in filet, especially since he was promised it was extremely lean. However, the waiter felt terrible and gave us dessert on the house. 

My scallops were perfectly done and the accompaniments were a good pairing for the dish. 

The ambiance and decoration were beautiful so this spot would be the right place for a special occasion or business meal."}
{"text":"Fabulous ambiance, great service, outstanding food.  I suggest the Oyster Rockerfella, table side Cesar salad, steak Oscar style and a few dirty martinis. 5 stars."}
{"text":"flew in for a meeting and was taken to Rare for drinks and dinner.  The atmosphere is great, an old-school steakhouse feel.  Fantastic staff.  Great wine list.  The pork belly/foiegras was THE best I have ever had.  I had the two small bone-in filets.  Cooked as ordered and tasty; though I prefer my filets thicker as opposed to the 3/4 inch filets they serve.  One big thick bone-in would be better.  The Wedge sale was terrific.  The hashbrowns were quite tasty too.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This sort of place is typically out of my price range, but my father asked where I wanted to go for my birthday (and he told me to pick anywhere) so of course I chose Rare. It did not disappoint! The ambiance is very high class, but also open enough where I could bring my 4 month old son and not get glares from other restaurant-goers. The steaks are, of course, scrumptious, and the side dishes are enough to share, although that doesn't necessarily mean that you should. Ordered a few drinks, since it was my birthday, and had a great time chatting with my family. I will definitely be back on special occasions!"}
{"text":"My first visit was to duck inside with hubs for a slice of chocolate cake after dinner at another restaurant. The atmosphere was gorgeous, the cake was delicious, and a single slice was so big that there was plenty to bring home. I was looking forward to coming back.

The main reason I wanted to write a review was over my recent NON-dining experience. I'd made reservations for this past Saturday evening via OpenTable. I didn't like having to create an online account to do so, but this is where my dad wanted to go. I specified in my notes that I was bringing my elderly grandmother who has a difficult time walking. On good days she still needs a cane, on bad days, a walker. I asked for a table that was closer to the door. I received a phone call around 10am Saturday from a gentleman who very kindly let me know that FreakFest was going on down State Street, causing all the surrounding streets to be blocked off. Grandma would be forced to walk at least half a block, if not more. On top of that, there was a huge band shell set up right outside their restaurant and he said we were definitely going to hear all the noise, even if we moved to the back of the restaurant. This was pretty much the worst case scenario for a pleasant dinner, as my grandparents are already hard of hearing.

I thanked him for letting me know and said we were going to try to find someplace that could accommodate my grandma. I didn't use the exact words 'please cancel the reservation.' I think I said something like 'Wow, that's not going to work out at all. Thanks for letting me know.' Since most steakhouses don't open until late afternoon, that's when I made my other reservation. I called Rare around 4:30 to ensure they knew that I wasn't going to be there...just in case there was any misunderstanding. They were very nice about it, and I thought Rare went above and beyond by calling me earlier that morning. I would've been absolutely mortified to get all the way downtown and subject my poor, weak, frail grandmother to such a horrible experience.

I'd give 5+ stars to Rare for their thoughtfulness and foresight. However, I was really, really frustrated with the OpenTable service they're using for reservations. I got labeled as a 'no show' and OpenTable had the nerve to send me an email chiding me for not giving more notice and costing the restaurant money. Seriously??? And then they sent me a survey asking what happened. I was happy to take it to explain the situation, but they gave no option of me informing them that the FreakFest had denied restaurant access to people with disabilities by blocking off streets. I also disagree that I personally cost the restaurant money. I'm sure that FreakFest costs a LOT of local businesses a LOT of money for the noise factor alone, as you can't relax and enjoy an elegant dinner with that kind of insanity going on outside the door. I wonder how many empty tables Rare had that night, along with other restaurants on the capitol square?

I know it was a form letter email from OpenTable and a perfect storm to make for a crappy situation, but whatever. First world problems, right? I'll definitely come back to Rare...but I'm deleting the OpenTable account."}
{"text":"Food was good, 3 or 4 stars. Steak and pork chops pretty  good. Oysters and wedge salad not great. Servers told us the wedge was the best ever - not so much.  Bacon was rock hard chunks.  Desserts were good. 

Service was very disappointing, 2 or 3 stars. They told us when we were seated that we, a party of seven, would have two people looking after us.  Wow, we thought. But it didn't take long at all for us to wonder where they were. We waited a LONG time for drinks. We had to ask for refills (ie they were not monitoring when we had finished) and it took ages for each drink to come. Generally slow service all night. Not sure where our two people went as the place was empty.  No more than 1/4 full!"}
{"text":"Arguably one of the best meals I've ever had. Why? Exceptional service and exceptional food. 

We came with regulars, Susan and Jonathan Lipp, so I'm sure that we were treated extra specially as their guests, but I have a  good feeling that if you showed up here and they had no idea who you were, you would receive the same service from the staff and the most amazing food  you've sampled in some time. 

The popovers are a reason alone to go there. They start the meal with them and I could have stopped right there. I'm glad I didn't however since  the ribeye, lobster mac & cheese, asparagus and  foi gras with pork belly. We ended the meal with Nutella creme brulee, something I've never heard of or had in all my travels.

Thanks to Sarajane for making our meal  special and to Chef Travis for coming out and letting us talk his ear off. Fortunately it was toward the end of the night and he was very kind.

An exceptional experience that I will look forward to again on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Rare with my son and his girlfriend. The entire meal was very good. We all ordered different steaks with sides: Asparagus, mashed potatoes, mushrooms, etc. Great wine list and good drinks. We will try again on another visit to Madison."}
{"text":"Rare is the epitome of a classic steakhouse and if you feel like a really fancy dinner, there's no better option in Madison. Everything about Rare exudes class. The waitstaff is friendly and happy to explain anything in detail and they feature a huge bar and wine list. You'll be served in comfortable high top tables or plush leather booths and eat from silverware, all while enjoying a quiet and warm ambiance. 

The steaks, as you can imagine, are cooked exactly as ordered, with the perfect amount of butter and seasoning. Unfortunately they don't include sides in the high price of the steak, but you can choose from giant, loaded baked potatoes and fresh vegetables that provide enough to share. Their salads are even special with delicious dressing and amazing nuts and cheese. Also, don't miss their desserts which are equally delicious. 

The prices are high, but thankfully you'll get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I was here for the 2nd day of their soft opening. The food is EXCELLENT. Although they are still working out ticket times, the wait staff were amazing. Amanda really knew her wines and wine pairings. 

The wine list is amazing and comprehensive. There are LOTS of wines by the bottle. I'd like to see more diverse wines by the glass, including another Zinfandel selection. 

The menu was that of a typical steakhouse with a variety of different cuts and sizes. I got the filet which was perfectly cooked. Beware - if you order a sauce they do not serve it on the side, they put it right on the steak. You can also get your steak cooked with a special rub seasoning too. 

Ordered some sides, including the wild rice, which was very wild! If you like unusual wild rice - go for it!

All in all, I see great potential with Rare Steakhouse. It is in a great location (across from the Capital), has great food, and good knowledgeable servers! 

I recommend this establishment and I will come back. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"First, I consider my husband and I to have above average palates.  We enjoy good food and we enjoy great dining experiences.  We finally had an opportunity to try Rare and went on a Friday night.  Our entire experience from start-to-finish was subpar.  To start, we had a reservation and we arrived about 10 min early.  We were told our table was not ready (although open table suggested they had reservation availability at the time we arrived) so we went to the bar.  The hostess actually made us come back to the hostess desk to check to see if our table was ready at our reservation time.  I have never been to a restaurant where the hostess doesn't come to find you when your table is ready.   So, we finally sat down where we waited a solid 10-15 min before our waiter came to our table.  We then waited for another 45 min before any food arrived (our salad came 10 min after we complained).  Our popovers were so burnt that the smell actually overwhelmed my palate.  Entrees eventually followed and my steak was over rested so it was tough and generally unpleasant.  Interestingly, we weren't the only table with food issues, as the table next to us complained to the waiter that their food was also inedible.  In the end, the assistant GM took the salad off our bill (thanks?).  We will never be back and I can't recommend anyone go, especially for the price.  Tornado Room is much better."}
{"text":"Been coming to Madison for seven years now, two daughter  as students at UW.  One graduated one a junior. Our first experience at Rare about a year ago formed an opinion for their New Yorker that rare is the best steakhouse maybe the best restaurant in Madison! 

Now having come back a few times over the past 15-18 months the restaurant continues to be the closest thing to a great New York dining experience in Madison!

The food came out perfect, from appetizers, an almost all crab crab cake,awesome burrata, or the simple but well executed table side ceaser, to the 4 perfectly cooked steaks, and delicious sides, the mashed potatoes are typical steakhouse but damn the onion rings are amazing!  Right down to a great creme brûlée!!

A wine list that can hold its own in any major coastal city (yes make sure to ask for some obscure wines not shown on the list) and service that could grab a Michelin star.  

I can't say enough about Rare, Madison is a great city but for us it's a HAVE to come to destination, and while there are definitely some good restaurants it's so great to get this quality of food and service when we are here!!!

Bravo Rare!!! And thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We came to this place to have dessert, we ordered their mix seafood plate and share it, it was incredibly good, their service is also outstanding and you need to try the bananas foster dessert."}
{"text":"Good food, lovely, quite atmosphere, and attentive, but not overly attentive staff.

We both got the 22 Oz prime rib, which we ordered with the fois gras butter and the peppercorn brandy dressing, respectively. Husband immediately stole my steak with the fois gras butter, but the peppercorn was lovely, too. Only suggestion would be to regularly sharpen their steak knives, which were straight cut line instead of serrated, which we appreciated, but needed a better edge.

Erica, our server - and I am writing this after half a bottle of wine, so I forget the name of the sommelier who was also lovely - were very helpful and a lot of fun to talk to. 
The desserts were amazing - get the chocolate truffle dessert with pistachios! I am serious. 
Rare was a great place to celebrate our 7th date-a-versary. 

I had set up the reservation via Open Table and asked for a view of the Capitol, and we got a great view, along with the delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"This time I am here for a regular dinner and boy was I shocked at how mediocre it was. We started with those giant menus (mostly wine list) but were not given a chance to order a cocktail while we looked though it. When the server was there she seemed competent but we ended up rubber necking when we needed something. For some reason my salad was forgotten even though she carefully read back to us everything we had ordered before leaving the table. My dinner was a pork chop with mashed potatoes and broccoli and for the most part not edible. Everything was heavily  overly salted. Same with the side of Brussels sprouts. Two of the four of us at the table had steaks that were good but the salt on everything else ruined the evening for us. What were they thinking? Expensive restaurants like this should have this under control. It was inexcusable. We chose to not make a fuss and send everything back, just tipped 20 percent and won't be going back. The place was packed and I wonder if others felt the same way."}
{"text":"Very good! 

Super classy decor, excellent service, very consistent quality. 

Only? place in Madison with all USDA prime beef. The large tomahawk is wonderful, as is the Bearnaise Sauce. Duck fat fries, lobster bisque are both wonderful. Delicious tuna carpacio, great pork belly. Chocolate tart and creme brulee are great, 4.5 stars, very good prices for deserts."}
{"text":"Rare has one of the most interesting dining rooms of all the Steakhouse options near the square, wood paneled and well lit rooms compliment the comfortable seating arrangements, whether it's booth or chairs, and you'll need that, because you're likely going to be planted in that seat for a couple of hours for your experience here.

Service: Our table's server was excellent, very knowledgable about the menu, the meat, and prepared a wonderful Ceasar salad at our table, which despite not ordering, I ate anyway since the 3 who did order it did not care for the taste at all. I enjoyed it and found it preferable to the Lobster Bisque I had chosen (a bit too salty, but still good enough that I nearly finished it all). The drink/silverware server unfortunately was not on her game at all, very curt and borderline rude behavior coupled with poor body language, sighing etc...diminished the experience a bit, I had to convince two of the ladies at our table not to ask for a manager (I understand people have bad days, and she didn't do anything that was overtly offensive so I really didn't want to make a scene about it, but her unprofessionalism must be noted here). 

Food: The second roller coaster of the evening, the Ceasar and Lobster Bisque as I mentioned were both pretty great, fresh and flavorful (despite the slightly too salty bisque). The popovers are also extraordinary, warm, golden, flaky, begging to be pulled apart and slathered with regular or strawberry butter.  High marks as well for the shrimp cocktail, crab cakes, and duck fat fries our table of 6 shared. 

Onto the Steaks, the supposed highlight of this venue, I was leaning towards the 10 oz. Filet but opted for the special, 14. oz dry aged strip \"Oscar style\" mentioned by our server. It arrived Medium Rare as I had requested, the cut was mediocre at best, and should probably have never been thrown on the grill in the first place, consisted of 4-6 oz. of tender and generally inoffensive but not particularly flavorful beef, accompanied by large portions of fat and gristle that rendered most of my meal inedible, though I must note that the crab and asparagus that topped my steak was outstanding.

Across the table, my friend was so disappointed in his Porterhouse, it had to be sent back, although it should be noted they removed it from the bill despite him not protesting to be charged for it, even though he only had a few bites. My date had picked the 10 oz. Filet and was thrilled with it's tenderness and flavor and demanded I try it as well. Though she prefers her steaks Medium, I still found it to be very tasty and easily the highlight of what I had eaten that evening. 

Perhaps my experience would have been different had I just gone with the Filet I wanted originally, but the bottom line is, in a place that has a reputation for being a top notch steakhouse with cuts that you're paying top dollar for, you need to have better than a 1:2 hit to miss ratio."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, service, ambiance an top shelf steak. Not cheap, be prepared to pay$$$"}
{"text":"I have had everything on the item and I have never been disappointed.
They employ the best and most professional servers in town, and their bar keeps up to speed with drink orders, rarely leaving you thirsty.

Come in, get a steak and a martini, and people watch the Cap square : )

Pricey though, and dress up a bit!"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst bar service in Madison.. I can't get over the fact how such a great place can't either get good help or isn't willing to hire a manager to teach their staff how to be attentive and a little more courteous.. The food is great.. If you're willing to spend two hours waiting for a drink and then asking the server three times if your table is ready.."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food and if you like wine they have great wine list.  We had carpaccio to start very ample portion. Table side Cesar salad, excellent.  A kale chorizo soup very well done. Dry aged ribeye with side of sprouts.  We shard everything and we did not even finish. Great experience."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This family owned streak house has 3 locations: Madison WI, Milwaukee WI, and Washington DC. 

From start to finish... simply awesome! Best bread... don't turn it down when offered. Cream corn with a tasty kick. And steaks prepared out of sight out of mind. This place rocks! 

Genevieve (Manager) and my server are two of the BEST in the business.  I'll be back for more, no doubt!"}
{"text":"We have now been to Rare twice and it has not disappointed.  The special touches are what makes the experience memorable and special.  We had salads, apps, and steaks both times....not to forget the popovers which are a MUST.  I will say our recent side selection of hash browns and brussel sprouts were not the best.  The wine list is extensive and has many great choices.  The service is exemplary as you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  The decor is very upscale steakhouse and not my favorite but to be expected.  You may want to bring a flashlight to see the menu, however.  All in all, its very expensive but I have not left wondering if its worth it!"}
{"text":"My review was handled by staff sending me flaming angry insults, instead of fixing the specific problems cited. Ugh."}
{"text":"We were in downtown Madison trying to hit up another location but there was a 1.5 hour wait.  We ended up at Rare.  Its your typical steakhouse.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the whole menu.  We started off with Pork Belly and Crab Cake.  Both were very delicious.  The Crab Cake was very tasty and had a nice amount of crab to each bite.  The Pork Belly was good as well but I wasn't ready to try the duck fat.  The popovers with the strawberry butter that was provided was so delicious.  The popover was very hot and fresh.  I ended up ordering a 10 oz filet migon.  It was cooked to my liking and our waiter made sure we were satisfied with our meal.  Everything was really great here."}
{"text":"My friend and I go to Rare pretty frequently and always have the best experience. We have a wine locker and Owen always gives us a great wine selection and is very knowledgeable and helpful. Definitely helping us branch out from our usual $5 bottles of Barefoot.
We've also absolutely loved having Carli as a server. She's charming and full of funny stories and interesting facts (we learned the origin of the Caesar salad and Oysters Rockefeller). She's great!"}
{"text":"This is a special occasion kind of place. Lovely ambience, delicious meal. Table side Caesar salad is a fun touch. Customer service and attention to detail is pretty amazing here.  Great job for a new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night was excellent.  Jose, Emily, and Tom took great care of us, from pre-dinner drinks in the bar, to a delicious dinner in the dining room.  My husband's steak was perfectly cooked.  I opted for salmon, and  it was perfect, too.  Bananas Foster completed the night.  You can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  (We used to regularly go to another noted steakhouse in Madison; they recently changed their menu, and it is no longer good.)  Some would say this is an expensive restaurant.  I would say, you get what you pay for.  You want quality food and nice atmosphere?  Go to Rare.  Want cheap?  Go elsewhere.  (And James in the bar makes some great drinks!)  Rare is definitely a 5-star restaurant, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'll start by being brief, don't bother.  Cross the Capital Square and go to the Tornado.  

Hoping for the best, experiencing the worst.  From the moment we put our three person reservation in, to the moment we sat down in the bar-room as we waited for our third party member, I felt it would be a bad experience.  After taking our coats off after finding one of many open tables open in the bar, I expected things to go south, but not as quickly as they did.  I walked up to the bar, cash in hand, but not waving it around or anything, the bartender silently walked past me three times without a look.  Better to pay attention to the four or five couples already enjoying beverages, or clearing drinks and plates on a  $40 closed tab than to glance at me.  Only after a second bartender joined did I get my drinks...that was the best part of the night.  Getting a couple of drinks.  After our third party arrived, we continued to sit in the bar-room so he could unwind with a drink before heading to the dining room...upon finishing, we walked to the host/hostess station at the front and let them know we were ready for dinner.

After being seated, we began to wait.  Others around us were getting served drinks and water, but no service came to our table.  We waited for five minutes, talking, trying to avoid talking about the lack of service...then came ten minutes.  Still, nothing.  Not so much as a glance from any wait staff, or support staff.  Upon reaching the 15 minute mark we looked at one another and decided to walk out.  I've NEVER done that.

I was surprised to see staff stare at us like, \"what, we were coming to you next\", or something...as they stared at us like a deer stares into the blaring headlights on a dark fall evening we simply left.  They were visibly dumbfounded.  It was the worst service I really never had the pleasure of experiencing.  

Do yourself a favor...go to the Tornado.  We were seated, enjoying cocktails and ordering within ten minutes of arrival.  Rare should be overlooked completely. that's the best advice I can give to anyone with the patience to read this entire review."}
{"text":"I came here for Restaurant Week during lunch today, and I really glad I got the chance to try them out.  

The space is beautifully redesigned and has the classic yet modern feel of a luxury steakhouse.  The host and our waitress Genevieve were friendly in a professional way.  Our waitress was particularly good about recognizing when we were ready for interaction or when we wanted a little more time to chat and enjoy our meal. 

My dining partner and I ordered different things off their restaurant week menu so we could try a variety of their items.  Between us we had the oyster shooter, the salmon tacos, the top sirloin, the gnocchi, the profiteroles, and the creme brulee.  

The salmon tacos were delicious, but a bit oily for my taste.  
The oyster shooter was refreshingly smooth.  
I requested the top sirloin medium rare, and it was a bit under for me and closer to rare.  The gnocchi was delicious.  I don't normally like gnocchi, but these were soft and pillowy but not doughy.  
The creme brulee was decadent.  I made sure to scoop up every last bit."}
{"text":"We stopped by after finding most other places packed. Rare has a great bar area that is more casual and quick to get into. 

Wine menu is on point. Lots of choices that pair well with the food choices. We ordered a bottle from New Zealand that was yummy and served a tad cold as it should have been. They didn't bring out the supporting wine bucket to keep it chilled though which was disappointing. 

Food was not memorable. I am weary of places charging these sort of prices as I expect the flavour to match. Nothing was bad, but nothing was any better than your usual steakhouse. The fact something like a spoonful of blue cheese sets you back 4 dollars exemplifies the absurd pricing. Be aware that medium rare is very much on the rare side. This is a very subjective measurement but I would expect less oozing blood in the center of a medium rare. 

The crab cakes were just meh. Maybe having been on the eastern seaboard I was spoiled, but these were just overpowered by some spice added. Profile was off. 

Crème brûlée was cold. It wasn't bad tasting, but once again for the price I would expect it done correctly. 

Service was friendly, but inconsistent. Had to ask for water refills a few times and never received the sides we ordered with our steak. 

I'd personally skip."}
{"text":"Definitely the best restaurant I have been to so far in Madison.  Food was excellent, the ambiance was very nice and the service was impeccable.  I ordered the burger and fries from the bar. The burger was perfectly cooked and the fries perfectly cut.   I also had the dark chocolate truffle tart.  Everything was spectacular, but one thing that particularly stood out head and shoulders above all my dining experiences was the sweet waitress Carli.  She was very attentive, always smiling, very personable and just so very kind.   If more people were like her, the world would be a much better place.  Kudos to Rare Steakhouse - a very rare and wonderful experience."}
{"text":"The decor of a classic steakhouse. Perfectly located next to the Capitol. I loved the atmosphere. The staff were all friendly, engaging, and helpful with selections. The food was exceptional: the filet was a prepared perfect, as ordered; Easy to cut, tender, and delicious. My wife felt that the scallops could've been seared a bit longer, but I felt they were very good. The salmon was crunchy on the outside and perfect on the inside. The Maryland crab cakes were very good as well. There was the hint of orange in the cakes, ok, but not a typical taste for MD crab cakes. The lobster bisque was tasty, but be forewarned: the lobster meat is chilled. The desserts: bananas foster was excellent. The chocolate cake and creme brûlée were amazing as well. Would definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just don't like steak houses, but I was not impressed by Rare.

I have walked past Rare so many times thinking it was too fancy and expensive for me, so I jumped at the chance to try it for restaurant week. The place gives off a pretty swanky vibe when you first walk in. All the dark wood and dim lighting makes you feel like you're a character in Mad Men. Honestly though, I couldn't care less about the atmosphere; I just really wanted to try a high quality steak.

I started off with a stuffed shrimp with remoulade and a vinegary cabbage slaw. It sure was tasty, but I finished it in like 4 tiny bites. Although it was perfectly cooked and seasoned, I just didn't love it that much. It was kind of boring and uninteresting.

For my entree, I opted for the baked truffle mac and cheese with an a la carte 10 oz sirloin that cost me an extra $22. The cheese sauce had a subtle truffle flavor, but it mostly tasted like anyone's homemade mac and cheese. Fight me, but I'd rather eat Velveeta shells. The crunchy bread crumbs on top were a nice touch though; they gave the dish some contrast in texture. The sirloin steak was okay. They cut it pretty think and tall so that it was similar to a filet mignon, so there was a healthy amount of medium rare goodness in the middle. It was a little underseasoned for such a thick cut; I had to make use of the salt and pepper shakers at my table. They managed to get a decent crust from the sear, and that gave it a nice tough bite to go with the soft, rare meat inside.

For dessert, I got the chocolate tart. This was the best part of my meal. The chocolate was super rich and sweet, and the graham cracker crust was salty and buttery. It was pretty much sweet and salty fudge. Simple and delicious!

Overall, I didn't love my meal. While the presentation was nice, the flavors were pretty boring. It was slightly better than eating banquet wedding food. Plus, I could have a better steak at home using my sous vide and spend less money. If Rare is supposed to be a prime example of a steakhouse, maybe that genre of restaurants as a whole just isn't my thing."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find. If you're looking for a top-shelf steak and seafood restaurant in Madison then Rare is a rare find.

Décor is classic steakhouse with dark wood paneling and inviting atmosphere. The wine list includes nearly 400 selections of wines and liquors. I'm a champagne fan and they had 12 different selections. If you're into red, the  Cab selection was amazing.

The food is outstanding. The steaks are wet-aged (my preference) and superbly prepared. Wonderful selection of side dishes to complement anything that you're having for dinner.

All of the above would typically get you a 4 start rating in my book, it's Genevieve the Dinning Room Captain that gets Rare to a 5 star rating.

My colleague and I had dinner at the bar and we were fortunate enough to have Genevieve as our server/bar tender. UNBELIEVABLE! She clearly knows her wines and can offer solid advice on any of the reds, whites, champagnes or spirits available. Ask her about the food and you'll hear words like \"amazing\", \"special\", and \"succulent\" to complement the vivid description. But what I enjoyed most was her amazing attitude. It's clear that Genevieve really loves her job and Rare which unfortunately is something that I don't find often enough these days. 

So let me net this out for you. If you're in Madison and what a wonderful dinner, either at the bar or table, then Rare is where you need to be. And if you're fortunate enough to have Genevieve as your host for the night, then you're in for a truly enjoyable dinner. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"Had horrible service. Took an hour and 45 minutes to get our food. The manager was rude. The entire place had left by the time we received our food. All they did was make excuses instead of owning the mistake. Took a round of drinks off our tab. I sent my steak back. The steaks were over cooked and were luke warm... They had been resting in the pass. Would not spend the money or time here"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Madison. The service is always perfect. Table side Caesar salad is a must, as well as the filet prepared Oscar style. We come back as often as we can!!!"}
{"text":"I love a good steakhouse and Rare is definitely in my top 3. There are so many good things to note..

First off, the decor is awesome. They obviously put a lot of detail into everything from the C shaped leather booths, to the textured ceilings and chandeliers.

Next, the service has always been first class. The last waitress we had was extremely knowledgable and made great suggestions. She was also very attentive.

Finally, the food.. Oh the food is amazing! They start you off with a warm pop up roll with two types of butter. Out of the three apps I have tried, they were all good. But the main thing to note is the steaks. I can only speak to the filet, but it was top notch! Cooked medium rare to perfection!

There are a lot of drink and wine options as well even though I usually just go with a beer.

The prices are a little high but very worth it. Just come prepared to spend at least $100 if you're with another person."}
{"text":"Disappointing!

Dinner 9-19-14

Steak was over cooked, under seasoned and the wait was too long for it after ordered.  Accompanying sauce cold.  Mushrooms the texture of kidney beans.  Couldn't even eat them.  Caesar salad very small and unexceptional.  Meat, ordered for it, was missing.  To spite mentioning to the waitress it never showed up.  Rice pilaf was seriously under cooked.  Atmosphere is way too dark.  Waitress was overly enthusiastic, and a bit pretentious,  about the food - which further enhanced our disappointment.

Over priced for what we were served. 

I will not go back or recommend."}
{"text":"Had birthday dinner there last night. Great food outstanding service and great drinks. Steaks were perfect restaurant week featured a great menu. General manager was great and attentive to table and accommodating a large party."}
{"text":"The very best steak I've had! I've been to steak houses throughout the world and this is among the best. Our \"captain\" even had us meet the chef and see the dry aging room. Food may take a little bit of time to get but it always does at this level of restaurant, if you're in a rush go get a un-aged steak someplace else."}
{"text":"We live downtown and have many fantastics restaurants to choose from but Rare is the best..  From the moment you walk in the door they make you feel welcome and sincerely appreciate your patronage.  Our daughter was in town so to celebrate we took her to Rare.  Ironically we had just returned from a trip to Charleston which has amazing food, but the crab cakes at Rare are the best we have had, including those in Charleston.  They are light, not too fishy, and not diluted with corn or other things that distract from the flavor.   The popovers they bring as starters are delightful.  Many places have fresh bread, but these are a unique treat.  As many others have said I always have the Cesar salad.  Made table side it is a treat.   My wife had a filet with mushroom sides that was excellent.   I usually have steak as well but decided to sample the scallops as did my daughter.  They were light and prefectly done.  I mentioned to the waiter that I was a little hesitant to select these since I don't like cream corn or sweet potatoes which was part of the presentation.   To my surprised, when my entry arrived he had taken the initiative to substitute onion rings.  The frits and broccoli sides were also excellent.  For desert I always have the chocolate cake.  It is huge, and really enough for two, but it is so good if I can't finish it I take it home.  For those who have eaten at the Capital Grill in DC, Detroit, Milwaukee, etc, this is better.

I am not a wine expert by my son is.  He took a semester long class in college and has spent a lot of time CA.  He said the wine selection at Rare was impressive but even more importantly the mark up on the wine was more reasonable than most restaurants."}
{"text":"Catie and Nick W. came in from out of town to join Danielle K and I for dinner during Restaurant Week at Rare.  As this is a busy week for restaurants, I lowered  my expectations and my experience here didn't even measure up to the diminished level.  I will give the restaurant credit as it is absolutely beautiful inside.  But because you dress up your place as a premium steakhouse doesn't make it one.  Throughout the evening, Rare and its staff failed to hit the mark on several things.  As the experience was painful enough, I don't want to rehash it to death so here are the lowlights:

1)  Reservations were for 7:45, not seated until 8:30.  Other than a quick apology, no other effort was made to try to recognize the fact of our wait.
2)  Hostess mentions that during the wait we could order appetizers.  Bartender informs us that only restaurant week menu was being served so out of luck for any a la carte nibbles.
3)  One first course option was ceviche.  Little did I know Rare's interpretation of this was two corn chips each with a single shrimp on it.  This was served on a huge plate which only made the appetizer look even more minuscule and ridiculous.
4)  Three of us ordered steak (2 at medium, 1 at medium rare).  As the server was quick to dish out the entree, we asked which one was the medium rare option.  The server was unsure so they brought over our waitress.  The solution she recommended-\"Just cut into them\".  Add insult to injury that no steak knives were served with the steak. 
5)  One dessert option was a cheese board.  One of the featured cheeses was a 3 year Hook's Cheddar.  Yes-I am aware this sounds like first world problems but when the price point normally is $23 for the cheeseboard, serving a very pedestrian cheese is a joke.  
6) The perfect end to this trainwreck of a meal is when the waitress informed us they were \"out\" of bill holders so she just laid the receipts on the table.  Again, this was close to 10:00 pm at night and nary a person was in the restaurant.  She then came back and asked if we could share a pen as there were no more pens left.  Really? Where did they disappear to?  I was expecting the Mystery Machine to pull up and have Scooby and Gang try to solve this mystery.

Rare simply didn't deliver.  It was a very amateur experience for a place that wants to be (or at least priced) for the big leagues.  Looks alone can't carry a restaurant.  Are they not aware of at least 3 other steakhouses that are just on the Square?  All of which deliver not only a better experience but better value.  Or are they preying on the out of town visitor that gets lured in but then turned off by it's food never to return again?  

I don't know the answer to that question but I do know this-without some dramatic improvements there is no way this place survives in the hyper-competitive restaurant space that exists within Madison."}
{"text":"Came here for a team lunch celebration. Rare is a typical fancy steakhouse with white table cloth, attentive service and of course... steak. I actually didn't have a chance to try the steak this time, but my coworkers who ordered the grilled filet enjoyed it. I got the Rare Chopped Salad which I thought had a tad too much dressing for my liking; however, I did enjoy the fried oysters on top. If I ever order the salad again, I'm definitely asking them to put less dressing. Our table shared the crispy calamari which I highly recommend as a starter. The calamari was lightly fried and I loved how they mixed in fried pimento. 

Come Friday and to get their \"Business Lunch\". For $15 you get a soup or salad, Tavern Burger or Triple Decker Club (both are HUGE) with Duck Fat Fries (delicious!)."}
{"text":"Ate here last week Friday.  Really like the atmosphere and the offerings.  My wife had a filet and I had a rib-eye.  Al a cart sides were really nice as well.  The in house aged booze for the Manhattans was great as well.  I would most likely come back to this place again.  The only reason for not giving this place five stars was because of the our starters.  My wife had the Chopped salad and wasn't overly impressed and I had the oysters Rockefeller.  The oysters are served with really good bacon, but the bacon takes over the dish."}
{"text":"*Restaurant week review*

Came here for restaurant week and had a fantastic time. When we came in, there was a short lull before our reservation was pulled up. After we were seated, we were offered a coat check. We were given a low-down of the menu for restaurant week with suggestions from our waitress, which was very nice. I tried the crab cake appetizer, the salmon, the broiled filet mignon, the cheese plate and the chocolate tart. 

The ambience is dim and suave, think \"boys club\" back in the day where men went to grab a drink and conduct business over dinner. The crab cake appetizer came out and was delicious: all crab and no filler -probably the best crab you can find in Madison (though I admit I haven't tried many others in the area). Afterwards, our entrees came out. I do know it is restaurant week so I forgive the smaller portions, but the biggest downside was the salmon entree was extremely small. A small piece of salmon plated on top of a few veggies seemed as if it could have used a little bit more. The salmon had a nice flake to it and a buttery flavor though, and the vegetables underneath were well done. My entree, on the other hand, was perfect. I had a beautiful medium-rare 6 oz filet mignon which came with deliciously creamy and buttery potatoes and green beans in a delicious sauce. Everything on my plate was extremely rich and satisfying).

Our desserts were also excellent. My SO enjoyed his cheese plate (Sartori cheese was used for the cheese plate with wonderful candied pecans and a beautiful contrast) and I enjoyed my chocolate dessert. It was rich and the ganache was well-balanced with what tasted like a bit of salt in the crust. 

One very minor criticism I would have to say is that I was a bit disappointed with presentation. All of the plates used seemed too small for the dishes themselves (I was afraid my mashed potatoes would spill off the edge and a piece of my dessert was a bit bent to stay on the plate). This wasn't a deal breaker by any means, but I definitely was concerned that I would get something on the nice, white tablecloth underneath my meal. 

Service overall oscillated between impeccable to strange lulls. For example, there were times where there was excellent timing in filling our waters and checking in on us to see how our meal was going. However, there were times we had to wait for an inordinate amount of time our plates to be cleared and for our check to be picked up. Again, not a huge deal since we weren't in any rush, but a strange observation.

Overall, we had an excellent experience here and were glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fantastic service, top notch dinning experience!

This is a meal I will remember forever! 

Just repeat the meal below and you will leave a happy and sophisticated camper!

What I ordered:

1. Pop overs- These are amazing, also, they just appear, they are the \"free\" bread that they serve you! They are made fresh and are served with strawberry butter that will change your life and sea salt butter.

2. Crab Cakes- 99% crab, 1% other good stuff. Fantastic!

3. Table Side Caesar Salad- they make it right in front of you and tell you a story!

4. Chilled asparagus soup- it was the soup de jour. It had an amazing salmon salad garnish

5. 12oz Filet- au poivre with mushrooms and a garlic brandy cream sauce. Words cannot describe how fantastic this was. Cooked perfectly and so flavorful.

6. Sword fish Steak- You don't see this too often on menus in Madison. I actually did not love the couscous it was served with, but the steak was unbelievably well done. Very moist and tender and had a lovely citrus glaze.

7. Table Side Bananas Foster- They do not skimp on the butter or the booze. Get really for a very impressive flambe! Great caramel sauce served over excellent vanilla ice cream.

I'm going to gush now:

1. This restaurant is outrageous! It's beautiful, from the dark wood work to the leather booths, to the library, to the extensive wine seller, to the bathrooms (which have super fancy paper towels with the Rare logo embossed on them). It's a gorgeous restaurant.
2. You server is not just a server, they are a dinning room captain.These people are extremely capable and knowledgeable about the menu and beverage list (which is enormous!). Think of them as your dinner spirit guide. Genevieve was our spirit guide. I highly recommend her if she is available.
3. They time things perfectly. You get ample time to enjoy everything. No one is trying to rush you through your appetizer.
4. They will make you a mocktail if you request one! I asked our spirit guide for something nonalcoholic and she said, \"I have just the thing.\"The bar tender know's what they're doing :) 

My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary, and they absolutely may us feel extremely special. From what I saw, they make everyone feel special and taken care of, but I was highly impressed by their attention to us and at their timing of all our courses.

Not to get too anecdotal, but there was a slight delay in the kitchen with our entrees, so they sent out a soup course to us free of charge. Little things like that really made this experience go from great to outstanding."}
{"text":"Let me first paint the picture of how we arrived at Rare. Group of 6 for a 7:00 dinner on a Thursday night. When we arrived out table was being set. I would say the restaurant and bar were both about 75% occupied. The rest of the story has 5 chapters - Problem 1, Problem 2, Problem 3, Dinner and How To Treat A Customer. 

Chapter 1. We were shown our table and waited for or server. Then we waited a little more. After waiting a little more we all verified that we were not wearing our Invisibility Cloaks (we were not). Shortly thereafter our server came to the table. Since we had ample (understatement) time to decide what we wanted, we ordered food and drinks all at the same time. Pretty easy process.  After ordering food I ordered a bottle of wine. The wine list is massive. It exceeds amazing. It is larger than life and that's a good thing. I picked out what I believe was a great bottle of Italian Red and smiled. Life was about to get really, really good!

Chapter 2. Did we put our Invisibility Cloaks on after ordering? No, we didn't. Did we wrap ourselves in \"Police Line Do Not Cross\" tape? No. What happened over the next 35 minutes was stunning in a bad way. No drinks. No service. Nothing. Our server arrived with several drinks that had been ordered but regretted to inform me that the bottle of wine I ordered wasn't available. No biggie. I get it - it's a wine list bigger than Lincoln's hat. Let's pick out a new one. Done and my smile returned (although I expected a bit of a wait before I had something to drink. I was thirsty at that point). 

Chapter 3. Salads delivered to the table. The wedge salad is tremendous. I think it is awfully tough to mess up a wedge salad and this salad went the opposite direction. It was so good that it left a memory. Of the things eaten, the salad left the biggest impression (don't know if that's a good thing or bad). Things were getting back to \"normal\" but I was thirsty before and now I'm really thirsty. Where is our server? Many, many minutes later I'm told that the 2nd bottle of wine isn't available. Huge wine list is no longer impressive. In fact, I now believe the huge wine list can probably be whittled down by at least 50% and one page instead of two. Pick a NEW bottle from choices brought to the table (so they ARE indeed available). Informed that the restaurant will take $10 off the bottle because of the problem. We're starting to find a groove. 

Chapter 4. The food arrives. The steaks are great. Cooked perfectly. The sides are great. The creamed spinach and corn made it to the top of the list. Brussels sprouts at the bottom. Hash browns and asparagus in the middle of the list. I may have been spoiled by \"other\" steak houses but nothing screamed \"WOW\". The food is great and prices are in line with expectations. I believe the prices are also supported by location. Tough to find a spot like this right on the Capital square. 

Chapter 5. Time to leave. The server brings the check and informs us that the bottle of wine that was chosen as the replacement to the replacement would be on the house and no charge to us. Okay.  Now I'm wowed. That's customer service that exceeds expectations. That's a free bottle of $80 wine. That move alone will make me go back to Rare and will make this whole review become a positive recommendation to anyone I talk to about this restaurant. 

The food is good here. Service is questionable (I'm going to say it was an off night for them and they normally operate better than this). Customer experience is clearly valued and part of their culture. Give Rare a chance and regardless of your experience I'm willing to bet you'll enjoy your dinner and leave happy."}
{"text":"Went to rare on Saturday to celebrate my 1 year wedding anniversary. Mentioned on Open Table that it was our anniversary and we just wanted a secluded table - the hostess made sure everyone that helped us knew it was our anniversary, and even one of the owners. They brought us some champagne and congratulated us all night. The atmosphere is so beautiful and romantic, everyone there is so welcoming and kind, and the service is AMAZING. Everyone knows about each dish in detail, they will accommodate you in any way possible (i'm a picky eater so that meant a lot to me), and made sure we had everything we could possibly need. They really made our first anniversary a memorable and enjoyable one. Thank you to everyone at Rare, we will never forget that dinner :) We will be back next year for our 2nd anniversary!"}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week. Overall, this was a decent place. The ambience is that of a typical steakhouse and can be a little uncomfortable I guess if you aren't prepared for it. The waiters were all very attentive and constantly asked about our food. I thought this was a really nice touch and I really appreciated that aspect of my dinner.

Onto the food. To start, the crab cake was really great and reminded me of my time back in Baltimore. It was full of crab with not too much filler. Definitely one of the best ones I have had in the area. I had the salmon as my main entree and I was pleasantly surprised. The salmon was cooked perfectly but the portion was a little too small (understandable since it was restaurant week and usually would be MUCH more expensive). For dessert, the cheese plate was amazing. I can't remember what the cheese was called but be sure to ask about it if you do come here. That cheese was heavenly and I really wish I could have brought some home with me.

Overall, a good experience. I would not come here if it wasn't for restaurant week as the prices really are quite high."}
{"text":"Confession: I'm a fraud. I have no business being in a place like Rare. Their regular price point is out of my league, but when I had the opportunity to visit them during restaurant week I jumped at the chance. I enjoy steak but I never order it because I am a terrible steak eater and want it well done; the cost of steak plus the side-eye I tend to get for ordering it how I like it has put me off of ordering it out.

Anyway, back to our glorious night. Upon entering we were offered coat check, which was very nice. Our table wasn't quite ready so we were directed to the bar and then we were seated a few minutes after our reservation. Our table was taken care of by a team of a server and a Captain. Our server was very sweet and funny (Nate, perhaps?) and our Captain Jahar (I am terrible with names, so that might not be it) was very knowledgable. 

Service was impeccable - the in-house sommelier was happy to answer our questions and chat with my friend about a vineyard she had discovered on a bike trip out west, and our food came out perfectly timed; we never had to wait long between courses but they also weren't being pushed on us. They do a great job of keeping a watchful eye without being intrusive.

Both my friend and I ordered the crab cake and the filet with whipped potatoes; she ordered the mousse and I ordered the cheesecake. 

Crab cake: I hate seafood, but I've found that I've enjoyed the crab cakes I've been adventurous enough to try at weddings. I was a little nervous because those have been predominantly breading, but among the appetizers this seemed like the best bang for the buck. So glad I went for it - it was delicious. The serving was very generous; it definitely didn't feel like they scaled it back for the special.

Filet: the Captain asked if I wanted my filet butterflied and I was down - I figured that was my best chance for even cooking. Even as I was cutting into the steak, I knew this would probably be the best piece of steak I've ever had. It was well seasoned, tender, and had the beefiest flavor I've had in a steak. At 6 oz, it was the perfect size for me. The whipped potatoes were clearly made with real butter, and while I wasn't a fan of the mushrooms that's more to do with me just hating mushrooms than any deficiency in the accompaniment itself. Again - I am a fraud. 

Cheesecake: definitely the right way to go. It was New York-style and came with a fresh strawberry sauce. The serving size was just right for the meal - after eating everything I was satiated but not uncomfortable. I tried a tiny bite of my friend's mousse - very tasty, but a really small serving. I could have polished it off in three bites. 

My friend and I wanted to treat ourselves on our visit, and we were definitely well taken care of. The only thing I was not a fan of was the up-selling. Neither of us were interested in drinking, but we had drinks offered repeatedly despite our declining multiple times. Same for the menu - they had several add-ons and upgrades to the base restaurant week menu and it was a little aggressive how it was presented and re-offered. For people who normally eat at Rare these things are likely in their grasp, but we were interloping on a budget and it was uncomfortable to have to keep turning them down. Overall, though, the night was lovely and I look forward to visiting them and their gorgeous interior again during a future restaurant week."}
{"text":"Meh..overpriced. Ordered the bone in ribeye. Asked for medium. Outside of steak was well done. Inside was slightly pink. Not as juicy as I would've expected. 65 for the steak + 9 for foie gras butter. The waiter didn't even tell me the butter would be extra. The way he asked me made it seem like it was complimentary. I've had better steaks at home or at friends houses."}
{"text":"You will not find a better steak. This place is exemplary in every way. The server was one of the best I have ever had. (Thank you Andy). 

Don't let the prices scare you. You need to treat yourself to a great meal like this. The bone-in ribeye is the best steak I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dining experience at Rare. They have an extensive wine list to choose from and their cuts of meat are second to none. My server, Carly, was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and the wines and really made my experience a good one. I'll be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Ok. Thought today being the 1st day but apparently there were 2 count 'em 2 SOFT OPENINGS. 

The lobster in the bisque was seasoned perfectly. 
The tomato blue cheese on crostini was smart and tasty. 
The Broth for the bisque was more soup adjacent than bisque creamy. 

The frites fried in duck fat came out hard with no condiment BUT BUT they were eager to figure something out and Asst. Server Shai did a great job of pulling together an aoili with a hint of spice and touch of sweet. 

The Oyster Rockefeller is served with cooked warm spinach, good amount of bacon and (not enough bread crumbs for me) BUT the Oysters are cold water - East Coast and they were huge. Done well and impressed the kid. Essentially, they passed the kid test so we'll swing around for those. 

Things to come: 
1) Happy Hour offering
2) I'm sure all the food will be heavenly next month when I return after the kinks are straight. 
3) I hope more butter fusion offerings. If not then Capitol Chophouse butter reigns. 

Things to expect: 
1) Good Service - These guys are only new to Rare. They are experienced and know their roles. They know pacing and appropriate amounts of conversation. 
2) An extensive wine list and their distributors include Frank Liquor; The beverage manager lived in NOLA for 10 years and carried away the accent. 
3) Mark & Clayton are two servers that I can vouch for. *Head Servers
4) Servers have business cards
5) Chicago steakhouse old feel but all spanky new
6) Multiple SubZero wine chillers maybe even a walk in humidor (or it's just another chiller). Either way - the place works
7) Salads made tableside by your server
8) Bananas Foster made tableside 
9) Good lighting (not too dark not too bright) I hate when places are so dark you can barely see the menu
10) No kids menu. 

I'll be back for Lunch then dinner before we hit the road."}
{"text":"This is a really cool place from an atmosphere standpoint.  However, I was disappointed in both the food and the service.  The service in general was prompt, but there was one element of the experience that was super disappointing.  I have a severe gluten intolerance, so I called the manager earlier in the day to see if anything on the menu was gluten free, and/or how they handle food allergies/intolerances.  He gave me a vague response about a few things on the menu he believed to be gluten free, and told me his servers were well-versed on food allergies. When we arrived, I asked the server if it was possible for him to to double-check with the chef to see if a certain dish I wanted to order was gluten-free, and if it wasn't, I would plan to order something else. First, the server acted annoyed that I was asking him to check on this.  Second, he never came back to discuss it with me, and just placed the order for the dish that I had inquired about. I could see if the restaurant had been super busy that he might have forgotten, but it wasn't even very busy. I know that it's an inconvenience, but please take food allergies and intolerances seriously.  Just because you, as the server, may not have to deal with these issues yourself, you have no idea how they impact someone else's health. Finally, each person in our party thought the food was mediocre, with the exception of the duck frites. Those were pretty delightful."}
{"text":"A dressy upscale steakhouse with good ambiance and a nice setting on the capitol square.

I had a martini, caesar salad and lobster bisque. 

The martini was great! 

The service was friendly, and the waitress raved about the caesar salad, so I tried it. 

It was poor. It looked like Cisco Systems pre-chopped romaine, with generic dressing.  It didn't taste very good, and it didn't look good. I like caesar salad, and there are many good caesar salads in town -- Lombardino's is outstanding, Tornado Room is great, Tempest is excellent, 43 North is good and unusual (grilled), etc. The Rare Steakhouse caesar doesn't come close to any of those. The chef should try one of those to see what the competition is offering.

Then the lobster bisque arrived, and I hate to be negative, but honestly, it was inedible. You would think that someone who works there would have tasted it and said \"Uh, we really need a new recipe.\"

So, it's a nice setting to meet friends over a cocktail. If you want to eat, there are many better alternatives. Actually, I can't think of a worse alternative."}
{"text":"We had a party of 5 for dinner at 7:00 on Saturday night. The restaurant was fairly empty for what would normally be a prime time, but there was bad weather in the area which may have encouraged some to stay home.

We started with drinks at the bar, which were good if not slightly overpriced for Madison. We were seated promptly at 7, and that is when things went down hill.

The waiter presented the menu and went into such detail about each and every dish without taking a breath that it was overwhelming, and most of the party just zoned out. 

We were brought popovers with artisanal butters which would have been amazing if they weren't burnt to a crisp. I'm actually shocked that whoever plated them thought they were acceptable to eat.

Finally, our main courses arrived with more issues. One member of our group ordered salmon, which, surprise, surprise, arrived burnt. Those of us that ordered steaks thought they were quite good, but the steak knives weren't sharp enough to cut them. We ordered duck fat frittes, asparagus and onion rings as sides. The frittes and onion rings were great, but the asparagus was nothing special, especially for $10.

When the bill came, we were offered nothing in exchange for the burnt meal and rolls. Again, for a restaurant that prides itself on service, this was surprising. I likely won't eat here again or recommend it to anyone else. For the price of a meal here, I expect better. Especially when there are so many AMAZING restaurants within walking distance of this one."}
{"text":"The decor is exquisite..loved it!!!

My visit here was with a large group (20+) . We reserved a private room. The service was good but I think we should have had another server assigned to us.

Appetizers- tortilla chips with 3 different toppings. I was not impressed. 

Salad: ordinary mixed greens

Entree- steak over cooked. I asked for medium well & I received well done/crisp) 
The potatoes and greens were delicious. 

Dessert: Creme brûlée- delicious

Overall this place was ok. I would not go out of my way to return"}
{"text":"Good food, decent service, elegant atmosphere, and great location.  Rare was a good spot for my business dinner on a Wednesday night.

My chopped house salad was good and my 8 oz filet - cooked medium - was excellent.  Our appetizer (crab cakes) and sides (Brussels sprouts, hash browns, and creamed corn) were all good, though not out of this world.

The service was a bit slow (they hadn't taken our dinner orders yet when the appetizer arrived, and finally took our orders in time for the massive menus to be removed so we could eat the appetizer)!  They also took forever to ask if we wanted dessert after our entrees were cleared away - they waited so long, we decided we were tired and ready to head out without dessert.

The atmosphere is elegant and old-school, which I enjoyed, and the downtown location is convenient.

Overall, a good spot that should step up its game when it comes to service."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Madison so far! Both the table side Caesar salad and the dry-aged ribeye were phenomenal."}
{"text":"Man...is this place good

I normally do not like steakhouses...because get this..I don't like steak.  However, Rare had a nice selection of fish as well

Rare is the upscale steakhouse near the Capital in downtown Madison.  It has the whole steakhouse vibe with a beautiful mahogany interior

The food is exceptional.  You start with the popover.  We used to have popovers in Boston at the now defunct Anthony Pier 4.  However, these are not burnt and are actually light and fluffy

Chopped salad is really good with the right amount of dressing.  You will like the crab cakes with a good consistent flavor..they also make a Caesar table side

I had the salmon and it was cooked perfectly...and salmon is an easy fish to cook wrong.  Hash browns are served like a pancake and unlike  most, they are actually crispy

Best part of the meal may be the dessert.  The Bananas Foster is cooked at the table and is just unbelievable.  Then again, it is made with a ton of butter and sugar....health food it isn't

Rare is a good experience...shout out to the waiter Ryan for great service"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner!  The largest wine list I've seen.  The best bruschetta I've ever had.  Ceasar salad made fresh table side dressing and all.  Excellent steak that melts in your mouth.  Highly recommend the au gratin potatoes.  And bananas foster table side.  We will be back for sure.  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This review is only pertaining to the organization of the restaurant because, due to their lack of organization, I was unable to experience the food and wine at this new Madison establishment. 

We had inquired about attending a multi course wine makers dinner with wine parings that was advertised via Grgich Hills winery. First, when we called to make reservations, the restaurant was confused and had it on their calendar for 10/29 even though the winery advertised 10/30. We eventually had to call the winery directly to get a straight answer. After a few different conversations, it turns out the dinner will be cancelled due to Rare's lack or organization and marketing of the event. We have yet to be contacted back by Rare and found this information out through the winery. 

Guess the is \"The Madison Experience....\" that will be missed."}
{"text":"A classic steakhouse with outstanding options in the menu - wine list & service. We started out with lobster bisque that we shared. It was excellent - really fresh and served at the table. Followed by the table side prepared Caesar Salad - each ingredient worked into the finished product. We were full at that point adding in the freshly baked popovers. But we had a porterhouse awaiting us & sides of Brussel sprouts & mushrooms. Top notch selection."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week and while the place isn't perfect, Rare served me one of the best steaks I've ever had.

The 6 oz filet mignon entree on the $35 pre fixe was exceptional. I never thought I'd ever describe a steak as melt in your mouth, but this steak melts in your mouth. It's juicy and flavorful and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I will probably come back again and spend way too much money on a steak because I have a feeling their other cuts are just as awesome.

I will say I wasn't super excited about the other courses. The portions were also super small, even for restaurant week standards. We had to wait for our reserved table and even then they asked us if was okay to seat us at one of the tables near the bar. We didn't mind the spot all but it was kind of weird that they were suggesting that they were giving us a subpar table after we'd been waiting. I sensed a bit of pretension but not enough to turn me off completely. At the end of the day, Rare still impressed me with their fabulous steak."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if I could!  Literally just walked out after a little over an hour and hadn't eaten a thing!  Decided to have a nice night out for my birthday and our table was clearly forgotten.  Started off poorly when it took a half hour to get drinks, got no bread before the meal and then our entire order came out incorrectly!  My husband ordered the filet and got the sirloin.  My sirloin was supposed to be butterflied to cook (which I agreed to after the waiter spent 5 minutes telling me about it) and that didn't happen.  We ordered 4 sides and only got 2.  We didn't have knives to even eat the steaks that were presented to us.  The waiter that brought the food tried to tell us that we ordered what we didn't order and our 'captain' waiter basically tried to tell us we did something wrong.  The steaks that we did correctly order were both undercooked and a manager was NEVER sent to our table.  We literally got up and left."}
{"text":"Had a 5-star meal on Saturday night.  Crab cakes, beet salads, all different steaks and sides (the BLT mac and cheese can not be beat!) followed by table-side bananas foster and chocolate cake.  Add in incredible service, a bartender who knew how to recommend wine and we feasted for 3.5 hours on one of the best meals I've had in Madison!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Rare this past Saturday for dinner. 

I will start off by saying this- I travel for business and I eat at steakhouses often. So my opinion may be a bit jaded. 

The atmosphere is very nice and relaxing. Dark and good for a romantic dinner. 

The service was very good. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu. 

The food....we started out with salads. My wife had a chopped salad which she said enjoyed. I had the table Cesar salad. It was VERY good. They make it table side FRESH!! Unlike me I ordered a filet (normally I order quantity over quality) and passed on the 22oz ribeye. It was cooked exactly the way i ordered it- medium rare. It had good flavor and was very tender. For the sides we ordered duck fat fries (pretty damn delicious) and asparagus (under seasoned and blah). 

Overall everything was good, BUT for the price there is a much better steakhouse in Madison (Tornado). I would not put this steakhouse in my top 10...

Will we go back? Yes, but probably for happy hour and an app."}
{"text":"For a start, although it says \"Rare on the Square\" you don't have to order a rare steak, I got mine medium rare..:)...so pretty much \"Medium Rare on the Square\"

Review - 
This is a higher end restaurant of which I rated it for. In all I would come back again but if I was to put this against Johnny Delmonicos or the Tornado Steak House. I would pick Jonny's first and then Rare on the Square ever so slightly ahead of the Tornado Steakhouse. 

The service at the bar was quick. They gave us all waters along with our beverage. My disappointment came when I reviewed the beer list and they only had 4 beers TOTAL and they were on tap. Nothing in the bottle!! It's luck I like Spotted Cow. The restaurant took a slight dent in its rating there. 

Appetizers: We were seated at our table quickly. The seafood platters looked  nice. The oysters tasted awesome but the rest of everything on the platter was kind of blah.The clams had no taste, the crab claws seem to come straight from the freezer, they were already cracked to a degree. I had to crack one a little as it wasn't initially done correctly and it cut my finger. I have opened a lot of shellfish in my life and never cut myself. I suggest they either do it all correctly or not at all and let the customer do it. A slight dent in the rating due to the tasteless seafood and shells not done correctly. 

The wine menu was awesome 400+ bottles. They had my favorite, Silver Oak Napa so we ordered a total of 3 bottles for the table. It all tasted great! The wine room at the back of the restaurant looked well stocked! I uploaded a photo. Bonus points on the wine collection for sure. I wish I had a basement which look like that :)

Soup/Salad: I had the lobster bisque soup which tasted great! Someone else got the Classic Tableside Cesar salad and the waiter did a great display of making it right in front of us. Whoever had the Cesar salad said it was amazing.

Main: The waiter performed an average meat display. The Tomahawk look massive! but they can remove the large 2-3 foot bone if you wish! I ordered the 12oz bone in filet and it tasted great, perfectly cooked to medium, the texture was perfect and very juicy. I was going to order a side lobster tail BUT they were out, so they took a dent in the rating there. 

Dessert. I had the chocolate cake for desert and it tasted nice. There was also a banana and ice cream dish they made right in front of us with brown sugar and several other ingredients on a hot pan. When I tasted it, it just tasted like melted banana with ice cream, so in the end a spectacular demonstration ended up with just an ok taste."}
{"text":"Tried Rare for the first time over the lunch hour during Restaurant Week.

Walking in felt warm and inviting.  We were seated right away and our server came over to explain the concept of Restaurant Week in case we didn't already know.  Then proceeded to explain each menu item, how it was prepared and what to expect.

The food was very good and the portions were just right for lunch.  We were most impressed that the wait staff knew exactly which plate went to what person and who had what to drink.  One person in our group did not finish their entrée, without asking, the staff automatically began bagging up the leftovers tableside.

Wow.  Talk about exceptional service!  We stopped on the way out to rave about our great experience.

Such a fun experience; looking forward to taking family for a visit when they are in town."}
{"text":"Steaks, sides and table service equals 5 Stars!  Eaten recently at some really top flight steakhouses in some bigger cities and none better than what we had.  Great wine selection to go along with.  Experience before sitting down...and this was a business dinner, was lacking.  The person who made the reservation in our group somehow booked the wrong night online.  This was a Wednesday - Rare was not very busy so they should of jumped up and down to welcome us anyway, instead the hostess looked at us like we were imposing on them for showing up. They eventually said a table would be arranged (how nice - dinner for 5 for a business tab). Off to the bar for a pre dinner beverage.  The bar is very cool, old school looking, dark and warm.  The bartender was slow to ask us for our drink order, had no personality, was not welcoming at all, and sort of scoffed at a special request cocktail one of our group had.  Compare this to the bar at Cento...night and day.  Cento has some great bartenders that strive to come up with interesting drinks on demand.  Anyway, the place is fantastic looking.  The food and wine was off the hook great.  The table captain was great but wore on us a little with every food and wine item being her \"favorite\"."}
{"text":"I see I'm writing one of the only negative reviews about Rare, so maybe we were there on an off night.  I hope so for their sake. 

Service: REALLY nice servers and staff, but our table wasn't clean and we didn't get utensils, plates, drinks, etc... in timely or consistent manner. 

Food: from average to downright gross. The caprese tower was made with an unripe hothouse tomato and grocery store mozzarella.  The Brussels sprouts were mushy and starchy (I love Brussels sprouts and will tolerate mediocre, but I couldn't even choke their's down.). They tasted a few days old. The most disappointing were the steaks - I had the ribeye and my husband had the strip. My ribeye was nasty. I had two bites and gave up. NO flavor, the bleu cheese wasn't a type that goes well with steak, and the texture was really, really cheap - stringy and grisly and stone cold.  My husband's cut was slightly better, but nothing to write home about. The wine wasn't a great bottle either, and we did seek advice from the sommelier who mentioned the distributor was seated next to us. On a positive note, I enjoyed the cocktail. 

Like I said, reading the other reviews it seems like we may have been there in an off night. We won't be going back as there are so many other great options in Madison for a good steak."}
{"text":"The HH here is really good. We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks and a couple of the apps. We shared the apps (Tartar and Poke). Both are very tasty- a kind of surf and turf with our drinks. I liked the Floridita drink. A fun and tasty play on the Hemingway daiquiri! We each had 3 drinks and 2 apps to share. The bill was about $54 (tip extra)."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best dining experiences ever.  The service was unparalleled!  So knowledgable and helpful.  From the foie gras pork belly to the Tomahawk chop with brussels   sprouts and ending with bananas foster, EVERYTHING was amazing.  I consider myself a gourmand with excellent service expectations and Rare exceeded this.  Thank you Genevieve, Talish, Bret and Chef Travis for making our anniversary a memorable one!  Do not hesitate coming here...it will be unforgettable."}
{"text":"I was captive as soon as I heard, \"Chimay on tap\".
I was still full from Hubbards diner but really wanted to try the short ribs that I saw on the online menu; unfortunately, the short ribs were replaced by bone in pork chops. ... I was soo looking forward to the short ribs. 
Before the main course, I had a serving of popovers. They were delicious with a scoop of whipped strawberry butter and regular whipped salted butter. The strawberry butter was strawberry and made me wish for a scoop of strawberry ice cream. It was amazing but I was conflicted by sweet butter on a salty popover.
The 2 pork chops were cooked perfectly with a hint of pink and juicy throughout. The broccolini were the size of my fingers and al dente. I subbed the duck fat fries for the mashed potatoes. There was easily enough food to feed a small family.
The meal was tasty but for my tastes it was too salty. By the end of the meal all I could taste was the salt. Next time I will have to recommend the low sodium special.
I would have loved to try the chocolate cake but my taste buds were shot and I was super full."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink at the bar only to be totally offended by the hostess who was so rude we (a table of 8) left before we even ordered. Never will go back!!!"}
{"text":"Some  background. I lived in Madison for twenty years, but now live elsewhere and was visiting. I am a food and have dined in true five star restaurants. To be fair we dined here on a night that the badgers played and won and it was nearly full. However, when we arrived it was nearly empty. We had reservations for several days. They messed up on the reservations and had some difficulty with the booth we had reserved.  From the time of our reservation until we were served our meal was precisely an hour. There were four of us. Our \"captain\" had an assistant, but was more interested in entertaining us than providing service. The ambiance is first class, the decor is exemplary and it has hype to match. We ordered the beet salad, which was quite good, but it was simply nice greens with a few pieces of beets and some very nice goat cheese. My expectation was a beet salad - not a green salad accompanied by some beets.

The steaks were OK (we had a filet and a rib eye), but unremarkable. The plates they were served on were cold and the temperature of the meet was just acceptable, but cooked to order at medium rare. The meat was not as tender or as favorable as I would expect for prime beet.

We had two sides -- a baked potato and duck frites; both were nearly cold. We sent the duck frites back, as the first serving was soft and not crisp. The second serving we very good. The backed potato was not served with the sour cream as ordered and it had to be pointed out. It took time just to bring the sour cream.

They have no specialty coffees for desert.

They are priced to compete with Flemings and Ruth's Chris in Madison, but are not nearly as good as either."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Rare twice. Maybe it's because I'm from Chicago and we have the BEST steakhouses around but I have been unimpressed with the food at Rare.  I do love the decor with the leather and chandeliers which make it very cozy.   The service has been great and very attentive.   It's the food. It just does not WOW me.  And for the prices of the food, I expect to be wowed.   I will say the lobster bisque was delicious as was the creme brûlée.  The steaks just don't impress and I also was not impressed by the crab cakes. Very small
And I felt there was a lot of filler.  
Unfortunately I think two visits was enough."}
{"text":"Well it starts off with  an 8 pm reservation  after waiting  10 minutes  at an unmanned  desk. An uncaring  Sarah Jane arrives to do nothing.  Eventually  they figure  out how to check our coats. It is  Wisconsin.  And drop us off at an a great booth, no menus  or wine list.  Ok server shows, (here  is wine list it's huge I will  be back) lol. Taking  an order - OK we order wine. And wait, wait, observe  server at 4 other tables. It has now been 35 minutes since seating and wine shows up. Last bottle  in stock had to look hard. Starts telling  us specials - we order. 2 Apps -table side Ceasars - entrées  and all the extras we are here to eat. 
Oysters Rock a feller - dry -small
Steak tar tar - bland -but pretty.  Really lacked quality processing for a kitchen  item .
Ceasars - Great  Table side love concept. Classic . Might as well have done it in back. Set ingredients no personal  touch or quality  interaction.
  T-bone s 1 ordered well with pepper rub. More like charcoal. Must have forgot it. Seriously top crumbled when cutting.  LUCKY had blue cheese  on it to make it look ok to serve.  My med rare ok tastless. You sure you aged it? At $75 apiece  and lots of steakhouses under our belt it was . JUST POOR.
Wait before  our entrees are served we ordered a second bottle from a neighboring waiter. Arrived about have way thru steak. Or when we were half done. 
Sauces- mushroom - cooked to death- pudding 
Bearnaise- like a lemon exploded. 
We surrendered.  Ordered  a creme Brule.  Sea salt -yea that's what it tasted like.
We tipped the busboy  and other waiter and about 13%for server. What a waste of $700.00 before tipping.  To bad they worried about there labor dollars instead of a dining  experience of customers  who would  have been back. Poor floor  management.  And weak kitchen  follow thru. 
It was a 3 hour dining  (experience )lol 
Will say service wise the Captain  was a great guy to bad we did not have him. He exemplifies service. But it appeared he could  not fix our server."}
{"text":"We were able to get a nice table without a wait even when their reserved tables were booked! Had the 6oz and 120z filet mignon medium rare and it was incredible!!! Cooked perfectly... And the service was superior. Everyone was extremely helpful and courteous!"}
{"text":"Exactly what Yelp rating meant.  This is as good as it gets.  If this is in NYC, i would give it a 4.5, but definitely a 5 here in Wisconsin.  It felt like Capital Grille in NY with slightly higher price, but given i have been disappointed many times prior for good steak in Madison.  This was great. Steaks / lobster/ sides were all done correctly with proper and clear utensils  plus spotless glasses.

Will come again (with Vendor... lol)"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a better rating, but just cannot. I have been to Rare on three separate occasions and would \"possibly\" give it another try in the future.

First time I went was great. From the friendliness of the service all the way to the last bite of the meal, which brought me back once again.

My second experience was about 10 minutes long. Took a table in the bar area with the plan to have a cocktail and a light dinner with the lady, and did not even get approached by a server for that 10 minutes. Sorry, but a place of this level the service should be superior, and i've had service be more attentive at Denny's.....

Third and last time iced this place for me. Called and made a reservation for 6 o'clock on a Thursday and showed up to NOT have a reservation, although there were at least 20 tables that were open, and many of those were still open upon my party leaving, we were told to grab a table in the bar area and a server will be with us. Though upset, I kept my cool and we took a seat at a table in the bar area. Over 10 minutes went by again waiting for a server to acknowledge we were even there! The server was fantastic, and clearly was not her fault as she was given the ENTIRE bar area and outdoor seating area to handle by herself, which shows this establishment has management that could learn a thing or two....

Both times I ate the food was great, the servers I had were excellent, however there is something about this place that makes me feel the overall experience  should be at a higher level. Giving Rare some time and I will be back, though they do need to work on providing a higher level of overall service to their patrons. Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time at Rare for us, the food was well designed, with lots of wine choices to select from. I opted for the \"Rare\" Manhattan instead, and was not disappointed.  
Ordered crab cakes as the first course and the were awesome. No fillers, all crab meat.
We chose to split the chopped salad and lobster bisque between us as the second course, and both were very tasty. Popovers instead of bread or baguette was a nice touch. Lobster bisque was unmatched. 
I ordered the dry aged ribeye with a lobster tail on the side. I ordered the steak medium, but it was delivered well done. Although I did not send it back, our server brought a replacement cooked medium as originally asked. Surprising for such an expensive cut. The lobster was slightly over cooked as well, but really very slightly. We chose an au gratin style potato side made with gruyere cheese...awesome.
By the time I got through the second Manhattan, all was going well and finished off with splitting chocolate cake for dessert.
We were well taken care of the entire time. If there were no issues with the chef over cooking the food, I'd give Rare five stars. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"At the recommendation of my good friend and Yelper Rob P. I took my gf to Rare for our 1 year anniversary.  A great choice to say the least!!
I noted our occasion in my online reservation, and after taking our coats and seating us, they brought us each a flute of champagne and said congrats.  *The key to my heart*
I looked at many yelp reviews of Rare before going, and the only real qualms I read were about the service and the temp of the steaks.  Both were perfect for us!  Our \"Captain\" and his assistant were both friendly and punctual.  And my medium rare bone-in rib eye was perfect.  The extra blue cheese crumbles I ordered for the top may have been a little excessive, but my steak was delicious!
My favorite part of the meal, however, was the first course.  I had the Cesar salad which was made table side, complete with a pop quiz and the history from our waiter about the origins of the Cesar Salad.  My partner had the carrot and dill bisque, hands down my taste buds' favorite!
B had the chicken in mushroom sauce with asparagus and we shared a bottle of pinot gris, all fabulous.
We passed on the desert and yet they sent us home with a small complimentary piece of cake.
I highly recommend Rare for any special occasion!!!  I can't afford to go again for a while, but I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I am simply addicted to the lobster bisque soup here. 
And the pop overs. 
And the manhattans. 
And well just about everything. 
The first time I was here we enjoyed a dry aged steak, hash browns, oysters and creme brûlée. Everything was fantastic! The steak was the best steak I have ever had. Cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. 
It's a little pricy but you get what you pay for.
The service has always been great. Everyone is friendly and very helpful at picking out a good wine from their huge list. 
If we are in a hurry or just want a taste of lobster bisque and pop overs we sit at the bar and order a quick meal. 
I am now addicted!"}
{"text":"I visited Rare for a private event, and this review reflects the experience of how the restaurant does with a large group w/o a seated plated course.

Bar:  Bar has fewer than 5 taps, which I realize seems crazy in beer-centric Madison. Each pint glass is rinsed with a glass rinser prior to the pour, a nice detail.  The rail liquors they use are of very high quality--in most bars you would have to pay extra. I can see this being an excellent deal for happy hour. A small happy hour menu was available (I peeked in case I was interested in visiting in the future) but the bartenders said that it had changed many times, so I'm unsure of what the menu will be now.  Service was speedy and polite, and from my observations, pours and drinks were consistent. One major fault--a lady asked for a non-alcoholic drink and the bartender said \"uh...I can get you a club soda\"  Any high end bar like this should have ideas for non-alcohlic beverages.  I noticed a paucity of fresh fruits/herbs, most of the drinks are more liquor focused.

Hors d'oeuvres:  Cheese plate with what I believe were Rainforest Crackers brand (higher end brand), and toast points. Signage did not indicate the cheese types or providence.  The goat cheese pastry was not that great--I love chevre, so they have that down but the pastry surrounding it was not good at all. I've forgotten the other items but they were all solid but not particularly stand-out.

Wide selection of smoked salmon, cocktail shrimp, oysters, etc. Did not partake but it looked mighty tasty.

Salad: Rare seems quite proud of their tableside Caesar salad, but to me, a critical purpose of the tableside salad is that the dressing is made at the table.  Dressing was already prepared. Asparagus was fine but to me it's something that typically suffers in a group dining event like this. 

The meats were excellent: Prime rib, pork loin, and a beef item that escapes me right now. A+.  Delicious and tender, with an appropriate variety of sauces such as horseradish dressing to accompany it.

Everyone loved the lavender infused creme brulees and Gail Ambrosius truffles.

The mahogany themed atmosphere is elegant and the bathrooms have all the accoutrements you would expect and neatly maintained.  Servers did a great job with the busy crowd. Private meeting rooms are available and I think they have wi-fi.

Due to the price point, I am unlikely to go here for dinner but plan to try happy hour.  Steakhouses aren't usually my thing but they did a great job with the event overall."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here to celebrate our engagement on a Sunday. Not only did they open the library area for us, but we had it all to ourselves and the service was the best I've gotten in Madison. They really pamper you! Celebratory champagne, melt-in-your-mouth steak and seafood, and their sauces (chipotle aioli and strawberry butter specifically) are out of this world!! 

Thank you SO much for making our engagement all that more special. We will be coming back for our anniversary!"}
{"text":"The food and service was fantastic! I loved the way we were treated. Everyone here made sure we were taken care of, without being overwhelming. I felt that people working here genuinely cared about us, the customers. The food was exceptional. Overall a very good experience! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Rare Steakhouse is the first and by far my favorite restaurant to visit this week for Winter Restaurant Week 2017. If you haven't already, definitely stop by before Friday, January 27, 2017 when it ends! Otherwise, I'd say this place is worth the visit on a special occasion if you don't mind splurging a little. 

We visited earlier this week on Sunday, January 22, 2017 and had a lovely three-course dinner with my boyfriend for $35 each plus a Pinot Gris for me and some ala carte duck fat frites on the side. For appetizer, we both got the pan seared crab cake and it was absolutely delicious with the sauce. I would have been happy if that's the only thing I ate that night. 

Next, for my entree, I ordered the seared Atlantic salmon which was cooked perfectly and the texture of the fish just melted in my mouth. My boyfriend ordered broiled Filet Mignon and it was also cooked well and the whipped potatoes on the side is another work of art, this also melts away and is one of the best mashed potatoes I've tasted. I could only hope to one day be able to recreate the same taste, but why do that when I now have a excuse to come back here for more! 

The duck fat frites was also another praise worthy side dish, with such the right amount of crunchiness and a great combination with the accompanying sauce. For dessert, my boyfriend got the berries and cream which is what I would recommend. While I got the chocolate tart, which was way too sweet by itself but worked well when complemented with the berries (strawberry, raspberry and blueberry). 

Although, I would probably pass on the wine next time which I had trouble finishing, I would most definitely plan another trip back here for special celebratory occasions or even next Restaurant Week! Overall, I had an amazing meal and felt completely stuffed afterwards. Come decide for yourself if Rare Steakhouse is worth all the rave!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Rare for my birthday. Hands down, one of the best, if not the best dining experiences I've ever had. From drinks at the bar pre-dinner, to the full course meal, all our needs were met and cared for. Very elegant and warm decor. Not stuffy at all, thanks to the vintage style tin ceiling and mahogany wood. From the bar I ordered the Royal Bermuda. Wonderful!! Fruity and dirty (if that makes any sense). Must be the Cane and Abe rum that gives the earthy flavor, I'm guessing? 
On to dinner... I absolutely loved the crab cakes. Like everyone else has said, wonderful chunky meat, no icky fillers. We also ordered the ahi tuna poke. Loved it! I think it had a salty teriyaki or soy sauce dressing. Steaks were amazing obviously. I ordered the 8 Oz filet, and it melted in my mouth. I got the stuffed potatoe as well and it was jumbo sized!
Since it was my birthday (a big one at that) they kindly offered me a dessert on the house. So my husband and I chose the bananas foster to share. Well, I mostly ate it by myself until I started to feel sick from just way too much food and drink in a short period of time. Gluttony at its finest, people....
All in all, a very positive experience, but the price for people like us, is a real \"sock it to ya\" kind of feeling. Definitely once in a lifetime for the whole shebang. I wouldnt be opposed to stopping in to the bar sometime just for drinks and maybe an appetizer."}
{"text":"Very good stop - in for a business dinner and this is an excellent setting for that.  Great location directly facing the capital building which is an especially nice setting at night.   Obviously a high end steak place so using that as a ratings barometer.  

Very nice high end and warm decor.  Strong and attentive service  - clearly a good service culture.  I knew no draft beer going in based on prior reviews, but since I'm not a local spotted cow is always a treat for me so no complaints there.  Very good wine options to accompany dinner.  

I started with the wedge which was very good - nice portion, flavorful bacon and spiced pecans which was a new twist for me.  I went with the 10 oz filet which was prepared a perfect medium and was very flavorful.  I did get the peppercorn brandy cream to dip a few pieces in and it was very good.  Sides included duck fat frites, asparagus, hash browns and Brussels sprouts all which were very good sans the Brussels sprouts - nothing there against the place - I just don't like them but I keep trying!  

A very good overall dining experience and great for business and special occasions.  A very solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ate with a group of 10. Service was exceptional. Ceaser Salad prepared table side with lobster bisque was excellent. I had a filet ordered medium rare that came  medium and was dry. One other diner's steak was overcooked so they brought him complimentary foi grai. Deserts were excellent. Good meal but very pricey."}
{"text":"I had the bone-in Ribeye and really enjoyed it! It was cooked perfectly! I also enjoyed their large club booths and friendly, knowledgeable waitstaff. We tried the Crab cakes, which we thought were good; mostly because they didn't skimp on the crab-to-stuffins' ratio, though I didn't think they were ground-breaking either.
We had a couple of different particularly delicious red wines-good selection! 

The \"Tableside\" Caesar was very good. I'm not much of a \"table-side\" kind of girl though. This type of fanfare is wasted on me as I am torn between being respectful of watching the waiter do his thing and what I'd rather do, which is chit-chat with my friends. 

Duck Frites were a tasty side, though I wish I had ordered the Yukon Pave like my friends did-it was even better!

I wonder if they told the Interior Designer, \"We will do the bathroom ourselves to save a little money.\" because it's a mismatched collection of accents that just didn't do anything for me.

Visit Date: 10/29/2014"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Rare Steakhouse. Enjoyed lunch on a Friday (only day Rare is open for lunch).

The host warmly welcomed us and gave us a mini tour---the main dining room has cool retro horseshoe shaped booths. Reminded me of Brat Pack era. Loved it.

We chose to sit at the windows in the bar for maximum people watching. Great views of our majestic state capital.

Lunch menu was short and sweet. I ordered a Lobster Roll with a Ceasar Salad and my dining mate ordered Steak and Frites.

Good thing we weren't in a huge hurray, since it took our food a full 25 minutes to arrive. Our food was very good. 

Not surprisingly the steak meal was the tasty winner of our two lunches. The duck fat fried Frites were awesome and the ribeye steak was substantial and tender.

The Lobster Roll was good, but not my most favorite of all time."}
{"text":"Rare Steakhouse is a super good restaurant. Their brussel sprouts were very crispy.  We loved the service by Ryan and Jahad. We had filets and the Kansas City strip. Don't miss out on the mashed potatoes and the crispy buttery popovers. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went last night to celebrate his birthday. I got the filet medium well and it was more well done in my opinion. My boyfriend got the bone in ribeye well done and it was burnt. Every bite was crunchy. I had the hash browns which were honestly the favorite part of the meal and he got the lobster Mac and cheese which in my opinion was the worst thing I've ever tasted in my life. I couldn't even swallow it. The lobster just tasted awful and I love lobster. We would never go here again. I was expecting the best steak of my life and I feel I could have went to a franchise for a better meal especially after how much you spend in there. The service wasn't great either. The waiter never walked us through the menu like they stated as we were seated. The best pet would have to be the drink the bartender made for me at the bar while we waited for our table."}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week and I believe that is the only time we could afford to eat here. The food and service were fine, but never could I justify the prices they charge even for a special occasion! Restaurant week has a set menu where you choose an appetizer, an entree and a dessert for $35. I had a crab cake, the 6 oz. filet with a small serving or whipped potatoes and mushroom ragu and berries and cream for dessert. All the food was delicious. There is no drink under $10 on the menu and no glass of wine under $12. There was a lot of effort spent trying to upsell us on other items - pricier steaks, side dishes etc. Even with Restaurant Week, one drink and our dinner from the set menu was $90 a couple. That is a little steep for a Wednesday night out in Madison. The decor is beautiful, but it was a little too dark for me. I need to be able to read the menu. Our main server was very good, but the assistants seemed a little off. Several times they put the wrong item in front of the wrong person and had to be corrected. They wanted to take our plates before we finished and they still had food on them. If you are going to offer this over the top service it should be impeccable. They did pass the water test keeping our water glasses full the entire time without having to ask. Bottom line - too rich for my blood, I have no idea how this restaurant stays in business in Madison, WI. Even to celebrate a special occasion, I would look elsewhere, but always glad to try a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good steakhouse. Great wine list, and bone in filet was terrific.  Lobster bisque was one of the best I have had."}
{"text":"The only reason not 5 stars is that for that price,  the service needs to be near perfection.  The food is superb.  The ambiance is spectacular classic old school high end steakhouse.  But after 3 experiences, I almost feel like I'm being served by actors pretending to be high end steak house servers.  (We will be back regardless.)

I gave Tornado club 5 stars, but note that it is a very different experience.  Almost apples & oranges."}
