If you love spicy Korean food and table top cooking, I am sure you've already been to Joon's. Everyone has been to Joons, well I have, and honestly I feel like it's been a little too Canadianized for Korean me. It was good enough, but the sauce wasn't spicy enough and it was lacking in that special oomph.

Anyways, so my journey to Korean table top cooking continued.. until I found Moo Kyo Dong. This little spot is located up in Thornhill past Steeles and Yonge.
It's easy to miss due to the location but I passed by it when I was heading to DaeJiYa for porkbelly BBQ 

Moo Kyo Dong sells typical Korean dishes like every other Korean restaurants around town, but when you come here, you want to order seafood table top cooking.

Ordered: Octopus-Pork Combo

* $12.99 per order, minimum 2 order
* You can choose level of spiciness, we went with regular
* What you see is 3 orders
* Octopus, pork, bean sprout, cabbage, ricecake, onions, greens, zucchini, carrots and glass noodle
* Once they bring it out, they will do the cooking for you
* It takes awhile to cook since it has pork and seafood
* Once it is ready to eat, they will tell you
* Even though we ordered regular spicy level, our forehead was covered in sweat
* If you like spicy food, you will enjoy this
* When you are done most of the food, you can order rice and they will make fried rice for you
* seaweed, diced green onion, onion and carrots are added to make this fried rice

Ordered: BinDaeDduk (mungbean pancake)

* Everyone is more so familiar with Seafood pancake, but not this
* This is made with grinded up bean so the batter is thicker and crispy
* BinDaeDduk is heavier compared to Seafood pancake
* They have proper flat top oven to make it at the restaurant
* People normally have it with rice wine (MakGulLee)
* I really enjoyed this here and would recommend this

Summary: Overall I really enjoyed food at MooKyoDong- although I can't really handle really spicy food (I know I should be ashamed to be Korean). This I know because my stomach couldn't handle all the spiciness the day after. I really don't eat spicy food often and I def felt the need to retrain myself after visiting this restaurant. My friends felt fine after so I know I am just a weak sauce.. but if you know you can handle it, give it a try!"}
{"text":"The hot pot octopus is good. I also really enjoy the mung bean cake that they have in the appetizer section. 
Food is spicy so be cautious!
I find their service to be weak but maybe I went on two occasions where the waitresses were having an off day?"}
{"text":"I've been here twice - the first time I really liked it.  However, the second time, not so much.
It's very different from other Korean restaurants, even in their banchan and their main dishes.  They don't have pork bone soup like other places, so instead I ordered a spicy pork.
It was extremely spicy, with remnants of pork inside, which was average, but wouldn't order again.

Someone else ordered the bulgolgi for 11.99, which was average, nothing special.

It's unique, and a restaurant everyone should try once.  They really try and their side dishes are great, but unfortunately I didn't really like any of the main dishes."}
{"text":"Location: 7323 Yonge St, Markham, ON L3T 1S4
Price: $$$
Service: Okay

The service was okay. There was only one server working so it was understandable that they did not heck up often. 

The food was pretty flavourful.  My friend and I ordered dukbokki, tofu (kimchi and pork) soup, and bimbimbap.The dukbokki was alright - I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It was probably because of the ramyeon that was added into the broth. So, it threw off my taste buds.  The bimbimbap was alright...there's not much to say about it. Surprisingly my favourite dish was the tofu soup!! It was really yummy- all of the flavours I hope would be there was there. It was almost like eating hot and sour soup but better ; the kimchi definitely made the soup stranded out. For 3 dishes it came out to almost $50 so I guess it's quite pricy.

Verdict: ehhh... I've had better but was disappointed."}
{"text":"This has to be the most confusing name for a restaurant in the GTA. If you don't speak Korean, you'll probably have a tongue twister pronouncing it. With a name like this, you just know they are catering to a Korean crowd. So if you come here, you can be assured that they are serving you REAL korean style food. To me, that's a big plus. 

Nak Ji means octopus and is actually this restaurant's specialty. So if you come here, you should get some octopus. It's not the raw moving octopus you might have seen on youtube. It'll be cooked. Aside from octopus, this restaurant also has some really spicy sauces. A lot of Korean restaurants seem to really dumb down on their spiciness. MKDNJ's food can be REALLY spicy. But you can always ask for mild or just order something without spicy sauce. 

They have lots of standard fares like bibimbap, cold noodles etc but if you come here, I recommend you get a jeongol (mix hot pot) or table cooking. They have several things that are exclusive in GTA (I think).

I've been here twice. First time we had table cooking spicy chicken. OMG it was spicy! I drank a lake full of water. The second time I had nak ji + pork belly table cooking. Less spicy this time. Both times were really good! 

Prices might be $1-2 more than your standard Korean place but the quality is higher. If you love spicy food, you MUST come here. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Another Korean restaurant with on Yonge Street.

Food: ok
Service: ok
Ambiance: good
Price: $2-3 above other
Seating: ok
Washrooms: stylish

Overall: would have gotten a 3star if the waitress has not forgotten at 430pm (empty restaurant) my soup order, and if the kim chi appetizer was fresher."}
{"text":"NAKJI  +  Fire symbol(banner)  +  Cute Cartoon Octopus on Menu.

As clear as Day-light, I knew what I should be ordering.
Even the smiley English-less Waitress had a curious expression.
One word came from her mouth...

SPICY

#15 Nakji Deopbap($11.99)

Octopus Tentacles(bite-size) submerged in Gochujang.
Chewy, a texture that Asians are accustom to consuming.

1.  Take some Nakji, Rice and mix with Nori/Green Onion/Sprouts.
2.  Add the plentiful Gochujang Sauce on the Mixture to taste.
3.  Add even more Gochujang until beads-of-sweat is induced.
4.  Consume Banchan or Cold Soup to cool down somewhat.

Now you have the ability to de-froze your vehicle without a key."}
{"text":"There is more of a community posting than a review, because my taste buds were defeated by the spiciness level here.  This community posting is to prepare diners what is coming their ways.

Preparation of Battle: The signature ingredient at Moo Kyo Dong Nak Ji is octopus.  We were determined to have it.  The kind waitress, who was fluent in English, advised us that the Octopus Entree with Rice was very spicy.  We opted for an Octopus Bibimbap as she said \"it is not too spicy\".  We ordered a Tofu Stew as she said \"it is about as spicy as the octopus bibimbap\".   We ordered a non-spicy Bulgogi with Glass Noodle for mom.

Battle: Octopus Bibimbap and Tofu Stew flat out conquered my BF and I.  I asked the kind waitress if this spiciness level was mild or normal level (figured it was not their \"spicy\").  She confirmed that this was their \"mild\" level.  Mild?  MILD??  This is, I swear, spicier than the \"spicy\" chicken at Home of Hot Taste, or the \"orange spicy\" (i.e. normal spicy) squid at Owl of Minerva.  I was too busy surviving the spiciness to figure out how the food tasted other than spicy.  My consciousness faintly registered that the octopus and tofu were very fresh.  Also, there wasn't much octopus in the bibimbap.  Not that it bothered me because I was busy chowing the chili paste with rice, with some octopus tentacle bits. 

Verdict: Mom's non-spicy bulgogi tasted the best, or because my taste buds could function with it.  There was a lot of beef, too.

After thought:  Place was understaffed.  Waitresses was too busy to bring us cold water.  Or cold beer.  Or anything after they dropped the dishes onto our table.  Minus 1 whole star.

If you like very spicy, or if you like a challenge, this is your place."}
{"text":"I am not sure if they specialize in octopus, but they have pictures of little smiling octopi on every octopus dish on the menu, so I decided to order one - the \"traditional Korean style spicy octopus.\"  \"Spicy\" was an understatement  - it was swimming in red pepper sauce.  Very good and tasty though.  However, the dish I'd really recommend was ordered by another of our party - the pork ribs, which were slow cooked and as tender as butter.  Nice assortment of relishes.

Very friendly and considerate service."}
{"text":"Meh, their famous cold noodle is OK. Nothing really special about this place. The squid rice is way to spicy. Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant focuses on seafood, so you would not find the regular korean dishes like pork cutlet there.

I have been there twice and tried the octopus hot pan, dolsol bibimbap, mung bean pan cake with pork. 

The octopus hot pan (served in square pan) is tasty and full of ingredients. Although we asked for mild spicy, the server has warned us it would be very spicy when we ordered. Therefore, if you cannot handle spicy or hot food, please don't try this. Hot pan is ordered per order and minimum is two orders. Each order comes with one bowl of rice. We saved the rice to the last and asked the server to stir fried it with the left over sauce.

If you cannot eat spicy, dolsol bibimbap is a good choice. The ingredients are generous and fresh.

Mung bean pan cake is freshly made but I find the taste is too plain. 

Service is fine although the server cannot communicate well in English. They cook the food in hot pan for you and let you know when it is ready to eat. Self served complimentary korean 3-in-1 coffee is at the entrance.

Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"We came here for our first meal while waiting for our number to be called at Home of Hot Taste across the street. I'm not sure if it's because we were with our token Korean friend who ordered in Korean, but the banchan provided for us was nothing like what i've had before. We had pancakes, pork jellies, eggplants, and large light pink pickled radishes, among some of the usual ones. He insists that the banchan varies at all Korean restaurants and I'm too used to the crap from Paris, but come on, I wasn't born yesterday! I had Korean food in Toronto before, and I've never received that variety.

We all sat down and perused the menu without paying much attention as we knew that there was no point in ordering if our token was with us. However, it also meant that I had no idea what was ordered. Considering there were 8 of us but it's only going to be our first meal, he made the smart move of just ordering two types of tabletop grilling meats - plain white pork and marinated beef. Both were delicious. 

There seems to be a lot of 3 stars given for this restaurant and I don't doubt that if i had come on my own this place might not have afforded me the same experience. But for now, I'm a fan. On to the second dinner."}
{"text":"Moo Kyo Dong Nak Ji what a name?! 

Though there is no lunch specials but the prices are reasonable even with that one menu.

Me and my yoga friends ordered 

- Spicy Seafood Soon Tofu
- Veggie Hot Pot Rice
- Korean Cold Noodles

The waitress though spoke limited English but was really accommodating with my vegetarian friend's request...

Banchens were all home made, nicely prepared and clean....

I will definitely come back for some pork ribs... yummmy"}
{"text":"This is about as off-beat korean food that Toronto is going to get - well maybe not the furthest off-beat. Nak Ji is Octopus and Makoli is a rice/wheat based alcohol. Somehow I guess everything goes with alcohol - go figure.
I've seen this place since it opened a while back. I really don't have any desire for octopus and the dozens of ways to eat them with hot sauce but settled for it after not being able to eat at another restaurant in the same plaza - more than a handful of screaming kids on an indoor playscape took away from a meal with my wife.
Back to this restaurant, the name of the place is very similar to one in Korea - a lot of restaurants open under successful names from back home. Not sure if they are related or just benefiting from using a name half way across the globe.
We order a table top soup/stew with a kettle of makoli - one of my wife's favourite drinks and my first time. I have to say, I really could have lived the rest of my life without ever having tried it - unless this place was unremarkable at it. The Makoli is made onsite and I thought it would have been better than what I tasted.
The food was average - nothing to write home about, but worth writing on Yelp!"}
