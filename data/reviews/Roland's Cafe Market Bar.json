{"text":"Overall a disappointing experience. After reading about this place and seeing the Yelp reviews, we were excited to check out Roland's for brunch. I should've noticed the big red flag when all of the Yelp reviews were from Elite members...special treatment or event maybe?  We arrived around 10:45 on a Saturday to be told that breakfast ends at 11. For a week day I understand, but I've never seen a place end breakfast so early on a weekend. I guess they don't want a brunch crowd? We were waiting for friends and I specifically asked the waiter if it'd be a problem if we ordered breakfast a few minutes after 11 once our friends got there. He went to ask the kitchen and came back assuring us that there wouldn't be a problem. I guess this was a total lie. We placed our coffee and breakfast order and got ready for a fun brunch. A few minutes after we ordered a different staff person came to our table and told us we needed to change our order. I explained that we were told it wouldn't be a problem but he didn't really seem to care.  The items we did order for lunch were all mediocre at best. The French fries were good but that's about it. We were extremely disappointed and expected better customer service from a restaurant from such acclaimed chefs. 2 stars for decor and overall vibe."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. The food was just okay. If they're going to have a limited menu, it better be amazing. It's not. Tasted two different burritos--nothing special. The French toast came out soggy and eggy. And the small bowl of $11 menudo...left me sad and hungry. I feel like this place is having an identity crisis--and it just opened. Feels like a farmhouse market, has mediocre Mexican food, and a random mix of pastries. On a positive note, the coffee was great and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"Our first time not our last! Great Mexican food we loved the citrus salad as a starter. The quesadilla with chorizo was really my favorite. The quality of the food was 5 star. The red chili burrito was very tasty and not too spicy. Really great drinks  from the bar especially the Paloma."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential. The service was excellent and friendly. The menus are very limited. Breakfast only served until 11:00, and no chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, chorizo scramble, etc. Nothing looked that appealing on the lunch menu. Instead of following my instincts and leaving for Gallo Blanco, I ordered the Pollo burrito, which was small, very bland and overpriced at $8. The sandwich of the exact variety was $12. The salsa served with it was green, runny, and somewhat hot, but otherwise  flavorless. The side of fundito soup just tasted salty. I didn't taste any pickled onions. I honestly would have been better off at Taco Bell, and I was hungry two hours later..."}
{"text":"This is a concept from Chris Bianco (pizzeria Bianco) and the owner of Tacos Chiwas. I wouldn't expect anything less than delicious from either of them, and my expectations were definitely met! I highly recommend the chorizo quesadilla - I could have eaten 5 of these. Cocktails are pretty good, but I'd like to see a few spicy options.  We sat at the bar and service was a bit slow, but I think this is mostly due to new opening jitters."}
{"text":"A new place with a new feel!  The menu is diverse and the staff is AMAZING!  Jack was our server and Brit was our barista.  Our four top had a range of food including the Mortadella Quesadilla (recommended by Jack), the Empa√±adas (with green chili, garbanzo bean dip), and the delightfully spicy Chile Colorado.  Brit hooked us up with a variety of caffeinated delights.  This place is perfect for you if you are looking for a modern take on traditional Mexican fare in an environment that has a galvanizing energy in a gentrified neighborhood.  Be sure to ask your server for his/her recommendation on the menu and sample something new.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My friend  spoke very highly  if this restaurant.  Parking is a problems. The plates we got had caked on dirt . Two out of four plates . We had the chorizo quesadilla.  It was dry open faced and not much cheese . We had their salad whi h came  on a large bowl . We asked for dressing on the side but it came mixed . It was a lime dressing which was light. We had the steak sandwich however the bread was o early crunchy.too much dressing.  We ordered the red burro . It was ok . Portion was small. Service was good .place was new and clean. Was hungry in three hours. . I was interested  in other  items but only served  for  breakfast or dinner"}
{"text":"When I heard about this new culinary venture, featuring two of my FAVORITE restaurants in the Valley, I was SO excited. I finally got to try it today! Tacos Chiwas + Pizzeria Bianco lovers unite!   The concept is primarily Mexican food, but with Bianco twists like the perfect crunchy bread, rustic decor, and the quesadillas looked a bit different and more 'doughy' like pizza would + were open faced. I ordered their Steak Sandwich and it was so flavorful! It had guacamole and beans on it, served with a side of delicious salsa. I ordered salad as my side and it was simple with a really tasty, tangy dressing. My friend and I split fries as well and they were a little oily for my liking, that would be my only complaint!   All in all, this is an adorable new spot near Downtown with fresh, tasty Mexican food... i'd recommend giving it a shot. Their breakfast menu looks tasty as well. Parking may be a bit of a challenge but there was a dirt lot next door and street parking as well."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, killer food and a wine list that has great wine at fair prices.  Serene environment that deserves your business"}
{"text":"I think it was a little pricey for the size of the burrito and instead of fideo, I would to pick the side.  Also I was charged for 2 ice teas so not sure if they charge per refill. Green Unsweetened tea was very good, the Colorado burrito was superb, this is the closest red Chile at a restaurant that has tasted as good as my parents New Mexican Chile! Love that they use Schreiners pork. Fideo was good, like the lime added. I also liked the roasted veggies.  It's in a cool remodeled building, but the acoustics suck, could barely hear the people at my table.  I would not mind going back to try the coffee bar, get a pastry or a burrito to go!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to check out this new place and it certainly did not disappoint! We stopped in for lunch a few weekends ago and had a great experience.  Rustic dining room that is very comfortable, great service and delicious food.  I had a non-alcoholic paloma (absolutely refreshing and so tasty) and the chicken tinga tostada with fideo soup - I think I could eat this every week.  We will definitely be back for tasty, reasonably priced food in a convenient location!"}
{"text":"There is tons of hype for this New Roland's Cafe Market Bar. The Bar was already set very high by our local newspaper stating that this could be one of Phoenix's Best New Restaurants.   Roland's is a casual restaurant with wait service and a bar. This restaurant is a collaboration of James Bead Award Winning Pizza Guru Chef Bianco, The Owners of Tacos Chiwas and they sell Cutino Sauces (a collaboration of Bianco and Jacob Cutino ((formally known as Homeboy Sauces))   The restaurant is casual. It very vintage but also accented with new. There is a large open kitchen and a very large bar. Above your head is a vintage tin ceiling and there is a very old brick wall with old filled in windows. They sell pastries and a few goods. The menu is mostly non traditional Mexican with a few Italian touches like a Mortadella Quesadilla.  The food served is of the highest quality. Bread and tortillas are ground locally and are made with local heirloom grains. The chicken used is free range organic. Everything is as local as possible and is the best!  I ordered the Pollo Asado Sandwich. This is a very generously sized platter. The bread is obviously Bianco Bread and YES it is AMAZING. The bread is outstanding with a great crunch and great flavor. The chicken was tender like butter. It was expertly prepared. It seemed like it was either poached or slow cooked (sous vide?) and mild spices were added to the surface. It wasn't listed in the description so I don't know if this was in error or not......but my sandwich was spread with refried beans..........I didn't really like them. They had little flavor and felt like paste in my mouth. The chicken was very good but it had little flavor and was topped with slaw and a few pickled onions. On it's own this sandwich had little flavor. Then I added the Salsa Cruda on the side...WOW that sauce is really GREAT! That sauce was a BOMB. It turned a whisper into a SCREAM....The sandwich turned tasty when I added that delicious sauce. The side of vegetables was very generously sized and also was very good.  My husband had the Carnitas Sandwich. There were either typos or a few hiccups here. They used romaine (hopefully it wasn't from Yuma AZ) instead of arugula. But the main thing we both didn't like about this sandwich was the extra thick application of mayonnaise and refried beans. We both don't think mayonnaise and refried beans taste good together. ALSO MAYONNAISE is not listed on the menu for this sandwich and many people including my husband find mayonnaise polarizing. Our waiter was very understanding and agreed mayonnaise should be listed as an ingredient on the menu and quickly had a new sandwich for my husband without mayonnaise. That said he could tell the carnitas were well made and seemed like high quality but this sandwich whispered the flavors.....and the Salsa de Arbol was needed for flavor. That sauce was really great too.  I took half my sandwich home so I'd have room to try a dessert.  Todays selection were cookies, a Cherry Scone and something else that I forgot so I went with the Cherry Scone.  I thought the pastry was good and it seemed to be baked to perfection but my half didn't contain any cherries....I think a cherry scone without cherries is a miss.  Parking was difficult. The lot and overflow lots were filled so we parked not too far on the street....Getting into the spot was easy but leaving was difficult because someone in a black Lincoln parked less than an inch in front of us and we couldn't back up much.   To some things up. Sandwiches are on amazing great bread and are painstakingly made with quality ingredients. Sandwiches are very mild but burst with lots of flavor when you add the Sauce. You may or may not be a fan of mayonnaise and refried beans on your Carnitas Sandwich. The Cherry Scone lacks enough cherries to be called a cherry scone. It was really an almond scone with trace amounts of cherry. Personally I would not order the sandwich or scone I had again. I can't say they were bad or anything like that but they weren't for my taste. I would however strongly recommend the Cutino sauces and purchase them. Our server was very understanding and attentive. Actually the whole staff was friendly and helpful.  At the time of this review Roland's is NEWLY OPENED (April 2018) and may or may not still be working things out. Your experience may differ.  After the bugs are worked out there is strong potential for 5 stars."}
{"text":"Bianco & Chiwas knocked it out of the park.  Luv the old building n tin ceiling texture with the red brick.   The pork chop was great.  The wifey had the menudo rojo was good she would have like some condiments oregano etc but it was very good she said. This kids had breakfast fast salad also good.  Boys had bean n cheese it was very good beans with fresh tortillas. The papas were soft and tasty.  Desert lemon cake very good."}
{"text":"Great new spot tucked away in a beautiful historic building. Good food and atmosphere. The only downside was that the waiter we had didn't seem to be as knowledgeable when it came to the menu or have the awnsers to my questions. Perhaps he was new and was still being trained.. I don't know. I still give this place 4 stars overall!"}
{"text":"They are only open till 3pm and still working out the details...I love it!  The feel is casual and special at the same time.  An awesome collaboration between chefs!  Both dishes I tried \"worthy\" in my book!  I am hoping they will add something vegan and gluten free to the menu!Yes, I will be back for a second visit!!"}
{"text":"Took my mom here for lunch .... she loved it! It was authentic and very flavorful. The fideo brought back so many memories and the salsa was fresh, tortillas were absolutely wonderful! Home made! Atmosphere was nice, service was excellent! If you want a cup of coffee and a scone, they can take care of that too!"}
{"text":"Loved the Pollo Asado Sandwich!  Great atmosphere, good prices, great staff.  Also loved that their ceiling and building is over 100 years old.  Will be our new hang out!"}
{"text":"Went to the new Roland's Cafe for breakfast this morning and left with such a satisfied feeling to start my Saturday.  Was pleased off the bat to find Roland's offered fresh-squeezed, orange juice to kick off my day.  I sat facing the window and unexpectedly noticed Camel Back Mountain.  Roland's Cafe is on Van Buren west of 16th St., where the mountain is east of 44th St and Lincoln, this fact did not diminish the most pleasant view from this cafe.  An urban setting with the mountain in the background is just what I like.   My order of rice bowl with veggies and an egg arrived.  I also included refried beans and corn tortillas on the side.  The brown rice was well-cooked as were the veggies.  The egg was sunny side up and mixed well with the rest of the meal.  I ordered four, freshly-made, corn tortillas and refried beans then proceeded to chow on the salsa trio with green chili, green sauce and red sauce.   A dessert was in the offing when I asked if they bake their own stuff.  The choices were awesome from sugar cookies to scones.  I picked a rye cookie that was nicely baked with cinnamon and sugar. The view of the mountain made the trip special to Roland's cafe and the food is gonna bring me back for more."}
{"text":"Five stars for the Love. Easy to see and feel the love hear. From the thoughtful design to the engaging staff to the well thought out menu easy to see everyone is on the same page. Could the execution of each item be a tad better?  Sure and I am positive that will improve. Two of us tried about seven dishes, all thoughtfully prepared. Only disappointment was dessert.  We would have really liked Some better choices. Besides that superb. P/s I've owned a dozen restaurants over 35 years. Wishing you well...oh and Dave did s great job"}
{"text":"Do you like overpaying and leaving hungry?  If so, let me introduce you to Roland's!  $11 for three tiny tacos, each with one or two slices of onion or leaves of cilantro, a few pieces of meat, and nothing else going on.  Simple is great, but the few ingredients better pack a punch and these fell flat.  Bland, boring, way overpriced.  Not sure what they're thinking with this place.  Oh, and they're too cool for chips.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Came here on a random Wednesday evening for their happy hour which was $2 off their drinks. Not the best happy hour for drinks but they have decent cocktails.  Ordered their chorizo \"quesadilla\" which is open face (no top tortilla). It was surprisingly very delicious. Though it looks more like a pizza, I actually prefer it without the top tortilla. I could see myself coming here again but more for their food and cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast at the new Roland's the other day.  Ordered chili colorado breakfast -- really good!  Atmosphere is good.  Service good.  Owners/chefs were all there and stopped by and chatted for a sec which is pretty cool.  I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Finally got to check this out.  We sat at the bar which we like to do at a new place.  Bartender was David. He is extremely knowledgeable about the menu and made suggestions.  It was a light dinner so we had the Chicken Tinga and Empanadas.  Both were excellent and amazingly filling.  We finished off with the Bread Pudding.  Great service and reasonably priced.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Roland's after hearing about it from a handful of trusted foodies.  Of course knowing the fact that the team behind this new concept is Tacos Chiwas + Pizzeria Bianco didn't hurt either... So when my husband suggested we head to Roland's on a recent date night, I was 100% onboard.  We were greeted right away when we walked in.  The space is gorgeous and well-done... it has a really cool, modern meets rustic vibe and whule clearly renovated, the restaurant manages to keep the charm from the distressed brick and the history of the building.  It's comfortable and casual and the staff seems to enjoy working there.  We sat at the bar and chatted with Alexandria and Davey, who were both super knowledgeable.  We watched the World Cup (nice touch with the TV at the bar) as well as the open kitchen behind us.  We also watched the attention to detail in the drinks being made... I'm definitely going to return to try some of those cocktails next time!  The food was excellent... we shared the Mexican Salad, Elote, Mussels, and a rice bowl with veggies and chicken.  We enjoyed everything we had! Portion sizes were generous and prices were fair... There were plenty of other items on the menu that were appealing, but our bellies could only handle so much.  The breakfast and lunch menus look solid too, so we'll have to return to try both!  I know that a five star review after just one visit is a gamble, but I feel confident about this one... it's my kind of place and I look forward to returning real soon!"}
{"text":"Was excited to check this place out during their soft opening. The space is really cool, staff super sweet, and the playlist fantastic.   The drink list spins Mexican riffs on cocktail classics. I had the negroni (made with sotol) and B went with an old fashioned that used piloncillo as sweetener. Not bad and served in pretty glasses.  Food was pretty good, too. Simple preparations with good ingredients.   - Loved the citrus salad- arugula, fruit, and a tasty dressing on the side - Veggie quesadilla- warm, soft, served open faced was ok. Just  don't expect a crispy/folded/cheese bomb - Carnitas sandwich- the meat inside was generous and tasty. I didn't notice any vinaigrette or salsa- if they were there, I wish there was more. The dishes of hot sauce they brought to the table were spicy. Good, but not the flavor I wanted to add. More salsa de arbol and lemon vinaigrette please! Came with a side of beans that were mmmmmm good. - Chile colorado burrito- Simple. Good quality meat rolled in a tortilla and crisped up. No rice, bean, guac, sour cream, cheese filling here. For some reason they brought a side of soup. It was ok, but I could've eaten more of the beans! - Rice bowl- again, just as described- rice topped with a roasted veg medley. No sauces, just simple.  Our server was pushing the choco-flan for dessert. I'm not a cake fan and this one (a little dry, not sweet enough even with the flan on top) didn't win me over. The tres leches, though, that's a keeper! Cool, cream, topped with a few candied nuts.   RCMB is an A-OK place to grab Mexican food close to downtown."}
{"text":"I viewed this as a can't miss prior to going since you can't miss at Tacos Chiwas or any of Bianca's restaurants.   I was right.  We went for a Saturday afternoon lunch. I got the Chile colorado burrito and a carne asada taco while my wife ordered the entomatadas. All three were fantastic and despite carne asada tacos being one of my top 5 things in the world it probably ranked 3rd yesterday. That's just how good the burrito and the entomatadas were. Chile colorado had the perfect spice level and great flavor. Meanwhile, with the entomatadas, I don't really know how to explain. It was almost like cheese enchiladas with an enchilada/vodka sauce flavor. There was a hint of that Bianco Italian flavor...it was awesome.  Just when we thought we were satisfied, we were offered a sponge cake dessert with a layer of banana custard/pudding and this was the star of the day. I don't seal out dessert, but this is so special that we got another one to go to bring to my brother and we decided to just eat it ourselves instead.  On top of all the great news above, our service was fantastic. I didn't catch her name, but she made he lunch even better as she was pleasant and had great recommendations.  Get here."}
{"text":"Holy Cow!! This place is fantastic! Had the Mexican salad with the steak. Steak is flavorful and tender. Greens are fresh, and dressing delicious. Food is tasty, and fresh, and service is the best. These people are simply put, very good at putting together great food. The atmosphere is wonderful. Original tile ceilings in this cool old building. The tile is beautiful and the big windows are as nourishing as the food. Yum!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hoopla is about. Average food. Average service.  Had the burrito and a pollo taco. Decent. Had the cherry brownie...dry. I've never thought as much for Bianco pizza either (same chef) so maybe I'm missing something?"}
{"text":"Peg and I wanted to go to this place since we heard about it, and it definitely did not disappoint. The ambiance is straight up Chris Bianco vibe with the comfort of walking into a welcoming place. Tacos Chiwas' Nadia Holguin and Armando Hernandez are incredible and their flavors show it! We tried the machaca burrito and chorizo quesadilla and they were both soo flavorful. I added an egg to the quesadilla and the creaminess was wonderful. The coffee is stellar!  Dinner service will happen in 8 days or so and looking forward to returning for that service as well.  So great to see incredibly good talent showcased.  This is a definite go-back!!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"I have had both breakfast and dinner here in the last month.  The food, ambiance and service were all excellent.  We tried about 10 different dishes for dinner--veggie quesadilla, carnitas and steak tacos, chicken tinga tostada, Chile Colorado burrito, cabeza/cheeks empanadas, roasted veggies, fideo soup, and for dessert tres leches and chocolate flan cake.  We all agreed that everything was unique and outstanding, except the soup and flan which were OK but not great.  It was uncrowded and quiet at breakfast on a weekday, but crowded and loud on Friday evening.  I would sit in the back for quieter conversation.  And very reasonably priced, especially given the quality.  The neighborhood is primarily used car lots, but seems safe during business hours.  Roland's instantly became one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I came here with some coworkers, and we were all incredibly pumped to try the food because of the big names behind the restaurant. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. The fideo was new to me and delicious, the salsa fresh and flavorful, but the portions were small. Plus, I only enjoyed my meal after dousing it in salsa, and I'm personally of the mind that salsa should enhance, and not serve as the main flavor for a food item. My coworkers who got the sandwiches were very satisfied, so I'll probably come back again for that.  In general, I would give the food 3 stars, but the service was beyond excellent (especially for such a large party) so I decided to give it a 4."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and coffee. Soon as you walk in, everyone is friendly and welcoming. We had the chorizo and machaca burrito, they come with potatoes. Very filling if you have a big appetite. Quality of the food is well thought out and done with love. They could improve coffee."}
{"text":"Love this new addition to downtown Phoenix. The vibe is casual and the space itself is beautifully decorated - light filled & airy. We ordered a few quesadillas and they were delicious - the light, crispy \"tortillas\" were to die for. Will definitely be back this week to grab a coffee & pastry for breakfast, and again soon to try the other menu items!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Authentic experience. Impressed with this place. No complaints."}
{"text":"Roland's Market, a project that was originally going to be a Pane Bianco-Tacos Chiwas mashup, is a place with an end result that's more on the Mexican side of things, with traces of Italian thrown in. And when you have access to Bianco's resources and the right people at the helm, how can you go wrong?  My girlfriend and I have visited a couple of times. Please note that their lunch/dinner menu is identical, with the exception of a few additions that get added after 9pm during \"late hours.\"  I really like their quesadillas. We've tried both the basic cheese, which consists of asadero and mozzarella, as well as one that incorporates chorizo. These pack excellent flavor and thrive on their simplicity, coming off more like a \"cheese crisp.\" It's a great example of how you can make something great with just using the simplest ingredients of the highest quality. Absolutely nothing else is needed.  The chile colorado burrito, which is something I don't see much of on local menus, was definitely on point, having just the right amount of spice and enough flavor to where, once again, you don't really need to add anything. I particularly love the flavor of the tortillas they use here.  We've also tried a steak sandwich that uses the Bianco bread similar to what you'd find over at Pane. Not the traditional flat bread, but the thicker style you'd find in more of his market sandwiches. In fact, it would fit right in with something I'd order for lunch over at that particular sandwich shop.   Other experimentations, such as the chicken tinga tostadas and entomatadas are both well executed, but I still feel that their sandwiches and burritos are really where this place excels. The Nutella french toast, for example, is fine, but can easily be found elsewhere. My girlfriend, who loves enchiladas, finds the salsa roja to be a bit too spicy for her tastes - although I thought they were fine.   French fries are on point, with a crispy exterior and very light interior. Beans and rice are okay, while the steak taco I ordered was also good, but not something I'd probably order again. Not because it's bad, but I feel this is kind of place that puts more emphasizes on their other options as opposed to just tacos.  For dessert, they offer a variety of pastries. I really like their Mexican wedding cookies, which are crunchy, powdery, messy, and spectacular. Additionally, we sampled a sponge cake which was somewhat similar to a tres leches cake, only with banana cream packed inside. Excellent stuff!  As of right now, Roland's is definitely on the right track to be something great.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Roland's was developed by Chris Bianco from Pizzeria Bianco and the folks from Taco Chiwas. The result isn't a fusion but a merge of cooking styles. The quesadillas are cooked in a pizza oven and are absolutely fantastic. I had the veggie quesadilla with fresh spinach, mushrooms, onion, and cheese. It was crisp and fresh. I also had their cookies and coffee. This is a great place and I'm excited to see it thrive. They're coffee and service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'll be back I had the carnitas sandwich and the fries!!! I recommend it, heard the bar area is pretty lively at times too.  Awesome decor"}
{"text":"The tacos are solid. Similar to Tacos Chiwas, which is expected. I had one of each: beef, chicken and pork.   The star of the meal was the desert. Needless to say, the tart was incredible.   Service was incredible. Highly recommended, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"The ambiance is good. Food not that great. Food portions are small, everything is alacarte.  Desserts were awful.Bathrooms anyone could come in, women could be in the bathroom with a man. Did not feel really comfortable. This is Not a place for kids. I speak the truth."}
{"text":"Went there expecting something delicious wanting me to go back after the first bite.  But sadly to say not intrigued. Tacos are mediocre at best. I order the carnitas and the steak(carne asada). Carnitas was dry not a lot of flavor.  Steak was just ok.   Then I had a taste of their \"quesadillas\" open face. The chorizo wasn't great.  Then my friend had the tostadas it was just ok. I think I enjoy the fideo soup better than the other items.    Would not be back unfortunately. I hope they change their menu a bit. I know they just open which I hope it gets better thru time.  Definitely will not recommend it.    Service was great."}
{"text":"The best thing I had was the water and dragoon IPA on tap. I ordered the empenada dish because the bartender recommended it and I was very disappointed. It's a 13 dollar dish with 3 small empenadas. The empenadas were okay, not great. It felt more like an over priced stale appetizer. I was still hungry after the emenadas that I had to give another dish a shot and that dish was the Chile Colorado burrito. The burrito was again, okay. For how it tasted and how it looked, 8.00 is about right. I won't be coming back here for a while until the food gets better.  As far as an overall restaurant environment, I liked it. But the food, I didn't like so much."}
{"text":"\"If anything is good for pounding humility into you permanently, it's the restaurant business.\" ? Anthony Bourdain  Roland's = The beautiful lovechild of Taco Chiwas and Pizzeria Bianco!  When the glamorous Phoenix CM, Hailey P., invites you to lunch, you go and get lunch.  It's a no-brainer!  She knows all the best places and she's the sweetest!  I had a beautiful order of Entomatadas that had corn tortillas; fluffy asadero cheese; fresh crispy lettuce; and covered in a sweet, bright, tomato sauce that was topped with crema fresca. It was bite after bite of balanced flavors and I was looking down at an empty plate in no time.  I also snagged a few of Hailey's fries which I dipped in the tomato sauce of my entomatadas.  Delightful!  On the way out, we got to see Chris Bianco himself with a box of bread.  He was all smiles and it made me smile.  Great energy from a wonderful guy!  ;D  Roland's is a gorgeous new collaboration between Taco Chiwas's owners, Nadia Holguin and Armando Hernandez, and the famed James Beard Award winner Chris Bianco of Pizzeria Bianco.  What a fierce and flavorful trifecta!"}
{"text":"I was excited to check out the soft opening for Roland's Cafe Market Bar.   I am giving them a soft 5 stars for the first round.  Upon entering, I liked the hospitality, the d√©cor with the succulents as table centerpieces and found it to be nothing flashy but appreciated the fresh, contemporary look with soft Mexican kitchen touches.  The open kitchen concept is welcome and the acoustics seem okay for conversation for such a large space.    They had ROC^2 coffee on drip with an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe bean.  Very nice.  Other coffee offerings (I had to ask) were a Spanish coffee with powdered milk and a Mexican mocha.  The barista was very knowledgeable so mad respect there.  I asked what the faves on the menu were and the response was \"anything with chorizo.\"  I can now agree with that 100%.  I had the Chorizo Quesadilla and WOW.  Something so simple was so well done.  Paired with the ROC^2 Coffee, I couldn't have asked for better.    I am also impressed with the logistics that went into ensuring the finest quality ingredients were part of the process:  \"Recently, Armando [Hernandez] drove down to Chihuahua to pick up 500 pounds of chiles.  He did this just so that his chile Colorado would taste a shade more like the ones from home.\" (Source: Phoenix New Times Article, Chris Malloy, April 17, 2018.)  Now that is dedication to excellence.  I really want this place to make it.    Other notables include gender neutral bathrooms and an open hand washing concept.   Soft five stars will become hard five stars once they fix logistics: flies in the baked goods display case because there was no backing to keep them out; to-go waiting area bench gave me wood splinters in my pants; no coffee drink descriptions; ALL forgiving because brand new for the first week."}
