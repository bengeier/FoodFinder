{"text":"The chili dogs rock!  The portions are huge so come hungry.  Big selection of appetizers that go beyond the standard bar food list.  Great selection of draft beer.  Noise level is good for lunch but may be loud for dinner."}
{"text":"We recently ordered fish sandwiches from here. They were HUGE! We did get the large, but it was so big we could've just shared one. 

Was not over fried. The French fries were hot and also very good. We will definitely be going again to try something different."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better people----wait staff was very friendly and the French Onion soup was amazing....Definetly recommend the home made chips...

Great Bar in the up and coming Homestead area.....Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ok, great list of draft beer, food was better than expected.  Reuben was great, fries were exceptional. Potato soup was killer!!  Kids enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"I was surprised to not see Dukes listed in your recent post on sports bars. This place is the ultimate sports bar but along with abundant TV s with local and various other sport options it has a great selection of beer on tap and a menu with something to please everyone. Is this a secret gem or a newly discovered gem?"}
{"text":"Awesome wings and pubgrub! Great beer selection and fun bartenders."}
{"text":"Duke's is one of Pittsburgh's best kept secrets in my opinion and one of my favorite spots to drink. The interior is really nice, the outdoor section is also really spacious and great for warm weather days. Beer selection is great and the bartenders/waitstaff are ALWAYS on their game. When I come with large groups I find that the waitresses are always very attentive and quick on their feet. If I had one minor complaint it would be with the food. Some people might like it but when it comes to appetizers I just find that they go wayyyy overboard with the greasiness/breading. I would highly recommend Duke's to anyone who is looking to mix it up."}
{"text":"Duke...the owner...is the man.  He's a true Pittsburgher and he loves everyone from Pittsburgh.  He looks like he'll beat you up but he's a softy with a big heart.  Look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friends...he'll hook you up.  He's also totally into the development of other Pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups.  Ask him for a tour of the old Eat n Park next door...I believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  Fortunately, the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly decent.  Definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially in the rain (lower level is covered).  Very relaxing atmosphere.  I wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent Dukes more steadily (we're on the north side).  Still worth the drive to feel at home, have a good bite and some cold beers."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't get it.  I've lived around here for some time, and the \"born and raised\" crowd can't get enough of Duke's.

Maybe it's the odd, you-don't-know-what-it-is odor when you walk in.

Perhaps it's the 80's theater-esque sticky floor.

Surly service, not because they are mean, but swarmed with yinzer locals tops off the average bar food and inflated drinks.

I wanted to like it, but just couldn't!  Someone, anyone... tell me the appeal here!!!"}
{"text":"Beer baby!! Always love the selection Duke's offers. Food has never been an issue.  Pinkerton sandwich is my go to. Fish on lental Fridays is good, calzones are monsterous and delicious, steak sandwich is tasty, cowher club brought me to my knees.  Service is always solid and on point as expected. Friendly faces and plenty of good conversation with the staff whenever I visit. Late afternoon during weekdays is typically busy due to after work crowd.  Weekends get packed. Late during the weekdays are usually a good time to visit if you want a little more intimate experience."}
{"text":"If you want to know the people from Homestead/Munhall then Dukes is the place for you.  A locals favorite they've seen a lot of growth since I started going 10 years ago.   They have a great selection of beer but I think where they really shine is in the food department.  

My favorite sandwich there is the Pinkerton and it's often hard to get anything else every time I go.  Pierogi Pizza is pretty good as well as there gigantic sampler platter that a party of 4 could eat together!  Dukes is also an awesome place to watch sporting events with their see it from any angle TV selections all around the bar.  Soups of the days are awesome (Potato soup yes please) and they have a excellent happy hour special that will save you a few dollars.  

I've always been treated with a welcoming vibe from the staff and I don't have any complaints."}
{"text":"I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.

They have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. 

It is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. 

The biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. 
Their fries are very good. And so are the wings.

I'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Great beer, great service, and great atmosphere! This place is clean and everyone is very friendly. The outside patio and rooftop are also amazing."}
{"text":"I'm reading on here that the food is really hit or miss. I've only gone to Duke's one time, but the food was good. It wasn't too busy so our service was very attentive and it didn't take long to get our food at all.

The place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area. We sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full. The dining room area definitely fills up with an older, have lived in Pittsburgh all their lives crowd, while the younger crowd is in the bar area. 

I'll definitely be back since I live in the area."}
{"text":"The food here can actually be a little hit and miss, but I love the grilled cheese club with fries. I get it way too much. People make fun of me.

They have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards, fyi."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always great. It's where me and my spouse hit it off and the rest is history.  It was a great fun, fast, date choice. Nothing fancy but always a good time."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Mon evening after trying to dine at Smoke Taqueria which is closed Mondays. Parking on street in front or behind off Hay St. Super friendly bartender. In warmer months they have huge outdoor area & big screen & upstairs cornhole game area. Okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection. Tried the italian club which was really good - two of us split one. Also tried sweet potato fries - amazingly good! Home made chips w bleu were overpowered by sauce. Bathroom was in need of plaster and wall repairs & was grossed out by toilet brush/holder on a shelf near toilet at eye level. Bet it's a fun place in warmer months."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to go for a sandwich and beer...it's considered a sports bar so there are numerous screens and it can get loud! Still I love it there, and the food is good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local eateries. The mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite, I wish I could purchase it. I am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fatheads sandwich. Food portion is great. The only complaint I would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side, as usual in most local bars. Friendly service, will continue to frequent with my family."}
{"text":"Food is good here. Great beer selection on tap. Sometimes the beer is on the pricey side. What I want from a neighborhood bar is a neighborhood special. Pinkerton is one of the best sandwiches. Good place to watch football, hockey, baseball."}
{"text":"On a Wednesday night, the parking lot was full but there was no wait for a table.  Waited over an hour for a corned beef sandwich, one taco, and an order of sweet potato fries. We were told the computer was not working right although everyone, even those seated after us, were served their food promptly. Our offer was not served at one time but rather one at different times. Maybe it was just a bad night for our waitress but we were disappointed."}
{"text":"We're always looking for non-chain restaurants by the Waterfront (they do exist...), and this has become a favorite. I've had the Hot Roast Beef & Fries and the Corned Beef on Rye, and both were delicious. Every beer I've had here has been ice cold, and the service has been strong too. It's a great place to watch a Pirates game too."}
{"text":"Cool place to hangout. Good food, good prices and selection on beer and solid service. Geographically not in the most convenient of locations though, so that's why it's getting 4, not 5-Stars. Would recommend going here."}
{"text":"There's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.  We were there on a Pens Playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  Our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  Our orders were somewhat mixed up.  The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  I tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  The crust was delicious and homemade.  If you are going to order something, I would go with the pizza.  We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.  If you are looking for good food, Homestead better choices at Blue Dust or Tin Front."}
{"text":"The transformation of this place is beyond amazing. If you haven't been there in a while you owe it to yourself to check it out. Clean and consistent. Friendly and fresh. Hands down our favorite place to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Solid Pittsburgh Bar/Eatery. 

Brendan and I have lived near Homestead for going on 3 years and only visited Duke's for the first time this past week. Sacrilegious, I know! First of all, I love the lay out of it. There's a shuffle board in the space between Eighth & Hays and Duke's and you can sit there as well. There are windows, but it's completely covered, making it the perfect spot to hang when it's raining. The upper deck is awesome, of course- who doesn't love a good spot to sit outdoors? Although we could have had dinner near the bar, it was really loud there, so we were thankful there was some additional seating in the back of the restaurant. It was quiet and more spacious there, which was nice. I wasn't too hungry, so I only had french onion soup and a side salad to eat. Brendan ordered a burger and fries and his mom ordered the potato skin appetizer. Everyone liked their food. The burger was pretty big and Brendan really enjoyed it. The fries were not fresh cut, but they were still very good. What I was the most impressed with was their beer selection. They had so many great beers on tap. I chose a wheat beer from Gristhouse and was not disappointed. Overall, we had a great time and look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I really don't see how anyone could give this place a bad review.  The food is fantastic and if it's not my belly luring me in then it's the awesome beer selection they have.  
My suggestion for those who are leery to try dukes after reading other ridiculous reviews is just order what they have on special that night... Everything is good so you can't go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that it's on special.  If not I could suggest other delicious things to eat but I don't feel like typing out the entire menu...
They often switch the beers out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beers on tap... They can also print you out a list of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for! (Lol)
Anyhow I love this place, the owners, and the staff! I highly suggest it to everyone who likes good beer and good food!"}
{"text":"I find it frustrating to read bad reviews about great bars and restaurants that are based on almost nothing. I eat and drink here about once a month and everything is great. I have eaten here around 50 times and never had a bad meal. Great draft and great service. This is the best bar in this area."}
{"text":"Came back tonight after a hiatus and missing out on getting food from the Franktuary truck at Voodoo Homestead. I was going to get a burger until I saw on the back of the menu that they do prime rib on Saturday evenings. For $19 you got a large cut of meat, which was pretty tasty, a large side salad, and I chose a loaded baked potato for the side. They were a little chintzy with the sides. The prime rib came with no horseradish sauce or au jus. I asked for a horseradish sauce, which they had, but the container was so small I had to ask for another. It was a similar situation with the large side salad. It was pretty big, and required at least a second side of dressing. The food was all pretty good, with the prime rib taking the lead and the baked potato bringing up the rear. As always, the beer selection was pretty solid and I really enjoyed my East End Brewery Monkey Boy."}
{"text":"Stopped for late lunch yesterday (3/4/16).  Extensive draft beer selection, by which I was pleasantly surprised (many neighborhood pubs in Pittsburgh, it's Bud Light, Yuengling or nothing, it seems).  Food menu is large and pretty typical pub fare, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, etc.  Ordered the tuna melt special, which was nothing spectacular, but tasty enough.  Pleasant atmosphere and bartender was very friendly.  Would like to go back when the weather is better and the back deck is open.  Overall, a good local alternative to all the chain places down in the Waterfront."}
{"text":"DUKES IS NOT WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE....GO SOME WHERE ELSE .......Fist off the owner needs to fire some of his employees, mainly in the kitchen. We ordered pizza and 6 wings. It took 1 hr 25 minutes and it was not busy at all. The wings were garbage and cold. The sauce was just dumped on them and the wings were floating in the sauce.  The pizza was not any better than any other pizza place. I had 4 star better than Dukes."}
{"text":"2 strikes. Enjoy the fact that there are other options in the area like Dukes but our last couple visits have been very disappointing. 

Hate to do it but I need to leave a review in hopes the manager can get things right. One of the main issues is that the kitchen is overcooking the hell out of the food I've ordered the past 2 visits. 

I can deal with a long wait which is understandable when there is a game on but having to wait for something that comes out missing something and overcooked can be frustrating especially given the cost. 

Last visit was a burger. I gave up and refused the offer for another. Bartenders were super cool about it and even offered me free drink tokens which I decided to redeem today. 

I felt bad just ordering free beer so I ordered a sandwich. It was the roast beef and turkey club which was described specifically on the menu as medium rare which sounded pretty good to me. The roast beef was beyond that. I would say extra well done. Obviously one of the chefs is struggling but I'm not totally sure that the beef was cooked in house. I'm not a chef but know when to pull a roast beef out of the cooker to achieve the proper temp. Anyway I decided not to say anything since the sandwich was still pretty edible and because of my girlfriend being embarrassed of me complaining. 

Decent beer selection. Waitress was very pleasant and attentive. Bar staff not so much this visit. We were ignored until I grabbed a table in the back. Neither of us weren't very happy about this. Possibly a no standing policy since there was only one empty chair at the bar? At least say something/acknowledge the customer that has been standing clearly in your view for 10 min obviously waiting for a drink."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday. Decor is very cosy with lots of dark wood and old sports memorabilia. We sat ourselves right away in a tight booth.

Draft list was excellent- so many unique beers on tap that I had never tried before! Settled on a Mexican hot chocolate stout that was delicious.

Menu was very meat heavy so as a vegetarian, I was pretty limited. Everyone at my table loved the French onion soup. I got the deluxe veggie riverboat, which was a solid sandwich. The side salad was definitely a lot larger than a normal side salad and pretty fresh. My partner got the Reuben which looked good, and definitely stole a lot of his onion rings.

Nice place for a quick bite in homestead! Our service was just attentive enough, and no one minded that we hung around a while after we finished."}
{"text":"My veggie riverboat (hoagie) was soggy and fell apart. They should use denser and fresher bread for their sandwiches.

If you want healthy food, this is not the place. The menu was almost all meat sandwiches, pizza, and deep-fried appetizers."}
{"text":"Had corned beef sandwich. Meh. 

Onion rings were horrible. Extremely breaded and doughy. Greasy as all get out. I hope the chef will take the hint when all of the breading comes back, as I had to peel it away to get to the onion."}
{"text":"Love dukes and love the food. I wish i could figure out the closing times or i wouldnt plan so many after work gatherings. Their food is amazing never had a bad meal and their prices are standard for crafts and actually pretty cheap for domestic"}
{"text":"Duke's is one of Homestead's best.  Located on 8th Avenue near the base of the Homestead Bridge, Dukes features an outdoor patio and  rooftop seating in addition to their indoor bar and dining area.  
Duke's features about 50 excellent beers on tap ranging from local brews to West Coast favorites.  

The menu should have something for everyone - burgers, pizza, sandwiches, delicious appetizers.  On my most recent visit, I dined here for lunch with my parents and my mom and I both gave into the \"favorite\" on the menu, \"The Pinkerton\".  This was a nice flip on the Philly Cheese steak.  Served on a delicious roll with shaved steak, peppers and mayo, you will not leave hungry.  My dad had the prime rib wrap and didn't leave a crumb on his plate.

The highlight of this visit was our waitress, Jamie.  The table next to us was throwing a hissy fit for almost no reason and then left without paying their bill.  Jamie handled it calmly with grace and then continued to serve our table with a smile and a good sense of humor.  In fact, the entire staff at Dukes is great.  The chef came out to try and deal with the unruly folks and he never broke a sweat and didn't let them get under his skin.  Very impressive and makes me want to come back again, soon!"}
{"text":"Duke's Upper Deck Cafe was the second part of our Happy Hour with Carrie Furnace tour on October 5th. The location of this bar is a little tough, and I would have never come here if it hadn't been for the Carrie Furnace tour. However, I really liked the establishment. There was a lengthy beer list and lots of seating spread throughout the inside and outside of the building. Even though we chose to sit outside, isolated from other people, the staff did a good job of checking on us. I enjoyed my beer selections, guided by the friendly bartender. I would definitely return here in the future!"}
{"text":"I went to Duke's Upper Deck Cafe recently and overall really enjoyed my visit.  I went there to watch an Elite 8 game, and felt a little out of place as I was the only person in the bar that didn't seem to know everyone who was there.  However, that quickly went away because the regulars and bar staff were extremely friendly and made the entire game more enjoyable (I was cheering for my alma-matter from outta state and they all encouraged me to enjoy the game and not worry about bothering them if I was loud).  

The drinks were very fairly priced and feature a full bar and some great craft beer options. The food was just OK.  I ordered the wings, which were very good in a unique way.  The sauce is a mix of ranch and buffalo sauce and the wings come submerged in it. Initially this threw me for a loop but after trying them I can see why people love them, messy but delicious. I also ordered the pita pizza, i would not recommend this as it just wasn't very good.  

I am looking forward to returning to Duke's this summer when I can sit outside and enjoy some craft beer and those delicious wings."}
{"text":"My boys and I stopped here for dinner one night. It was cold and dreary outside but warm and homey in here.  Our server was extremely nice. The menu had lots of options. They are kind of known for their potato soup so that's what I had. It is very good. It's a very thick soup that is velvety smooth. I would definitely order it again. It was perfect for a rainy night. 
My youngest son had chicken tenders. They looked a little over cooked but I tasted one and it was good. The coating was crispy and the chicken was juicy. My older son ordered wings with their house made sauce. It was good but not spicy enough for him. I thought it was good and would order it the next time I go."}
{"text":"Excellent wings and sandwiches, generally good food otherwise, and fair prices-- nice casual place. The service can be a little slow due to how popular the place gets at peak times."}
{"text":"Overall Duke's Upper Deck was a nice atmosphere and seemed like an after work hang out for the locals of all ages mid 20s and up.

PARKING
- Duke's has a small parking lot for maybe 15ish cars but since it was full, we had to find parking on the very steep hill with limited spaces available. Heels and hills are still not a favorite combination of mine. I am still not sure about parking rules in PA since I'm from TX but we didn't get towed so I guess that's good. 
 
BEER
- My husband raved about the beer selection and he wasn't off. This place has one of the largest draft beer selections of all the places I've been to so far. The happy hour prices can't be beat either!

FOOD
- The hubby and I shared onion rings which were pretty good. I like to think I am not a picky person but my French Dip was not a favorite. The meat was overcooked, bland, and dry. The as jus sauce was decent but could not make up for the thing that was missing. I would have to add horseradish or something if I every ordered it again. The fries were amazing! I ate half my husbands plate ]:). My husband had the bleu burger which came out Well done even though he ordered medium but overall he was satisfied with his meal.  

SERVICE
- We sat at the downstairs bar area and although it was busy, it was not chaotic enough receive the lackluster service that we did. It seems like the wait staff was working 3-4 tables in our area and some tables on the upper deck of the interior building. Our waters ran out multiple times, my husband was able to finish a beer long before another one was ordered, and we maybe saw her about 2 or 3 times during the whole meal. I can't give the place more stars because of the service experience but I would go back on a slower night or during weekend lunch to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Duke's is fantastic. Bottom line. Great staff. Great crowd. Terrific food. If you're looking for a lunch spot, by the way...go here. Oh...and order the sampler platter...something like the 9 sampler...and no for the money it costs take a whole lot home with you. 
Duke's is clean and well kepy...the staff is friendly and attentive...great drinks, great food. Reasonable prices. There just isn't a downside, folks...go here!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection. Expanding and remodeling has made that plays very aesthetically fun to be in! I love the outer deck and the upper deck. Ample parking. And the food is great.  

Wings are done just right! Crispy not under done. Great spot for great conversation and barfood."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I've been here for an hour and just got my food, which is barely warm. Food is not bad, but not great either. Very disappointed in the slow service. Didn't receive the soup we ordered. Nothing is more disappointing at a restaurant than my drink sitting on the edge of the table empty for 10 minutes. This was my first visit here, and will also be my last."}
{"text":"I wish I could review the food but unfortunately, I couldn't even get waited on. Wanted to catch up with a friend over dinner. We decided to grab a seat on the patio. As we entered the patio, we walked past our waitress, who clearly saw us. She even smiled at us.  As my friend and I chatted a bit, we noticed that the waitress waited on the other two tables in the patio but not on us. Ten minutes later she returned two more times to the other tables, but never once waited on us. We decided that she clearly did not want to wait on us, so we left."}
{"text":"What a cool place in Homestead. Love the environment and the food was really good. Stop here then head to the Waterfront to see a movie. It will be a great night."}
{"text":"Went to Dukes last week. They have really renovated the place, and added a lot of large screen tv's. The best part, tho, is the vast improvement in draft beer selection. I counted 46 beers on tap. If you are a beer head and are at the Waterfront shopping are, this is definitely one of your best choices.  The food is above average, and the selection is common pub fare."}
{"text":"Thank god for the draft list is all I can say. 3 things that were ordered were all wrong. Asked for no onion on all 3 and they all had onions on them . The place was not busy at all so if it was I could understand. The burger was solid though , steak on the salad was ice cold even though we were asked how we wanted it cooked so I assumed it was cooked to order and would come out at least warm. The inside of the place was clean and neatly decorated so that is a positive. Really loud place inside. I'd come here for the awesome draft selections but might pass on the food."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Homestead. Visited this bar/restaurant for a function. Old time charm , refurbished to bring you back to the early days of Pittsburgh. If you need to hold a small company function , please give them a call."}
{"text":"My husband and his friends had dinner at Dukes tonight. He brought me home a sandwich. 

I made an order for the Tomlin Chicken Sandwich with modifications. The Tomlin Chicken sandwich served without modifications is a chicken sandwich with mushrooms, onions, sweet peppers, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, & tomato on a roll. Served with mild and wild wing sauces. Choice of fries or chips. 
 I requested that the onions & mushrooms be kept off of the sandwich. And that the wild wing sauce be held. Wild is too spicy for me these days. The sandwich comes with both mild and wild sauces. I also requested for Swiss cheese instead of pepper jack. And that the sandwich come with chips.  I asked for a side of honey mustard and ketchup. 
Since I ordered from home and my husband brought it back, I didn't check the order before it left the restaurant. 

What came home & I got was a chicken sandwich with Swiss cheese and red peppers. With French fries. And hot sauce and a mystery sauce. I'm not sure what the mystery sauce is. It's got a kick to it but kind of tastes like dressing. It's not honey mustard. The hot sauce isn't very tasty. I don't know what it is. But it's salty & bland. No ketchup.  However the chicken sandwich with just cheese and peppers is very tasty. So despite it not being what I had anticipated and previously ordered at the restaurant, it's really good so I'm still giving 4 stars."}
