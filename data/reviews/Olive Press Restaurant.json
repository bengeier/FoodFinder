{"text":"I enjoyed breakfast here twice this week. The service was outstanding and the food very good. I had the buffet with a cooked to order omelet. I make many dietary requests and the waitstaff made it seem that I had no issues at all and accommodated me with ease. What really sold me is they provided me a to go cup of coffee with out even asking me. This will be my to go restaurant when I am at the PIT airport."}
{"text":"Bad start to a trip when you discover that they charge (in total after tax and all) about $8.50 for each bottle of beer - which by the way gets \"served\" in a bottle, without a glass, despite the fact that you are sitting down for a nice dinner. Also, the additional charge of $8 for scallops with the pasta is a little steep given the fact that you get just 3 scallops for that. Pasta tasted good, but the beer thing really threw me! I'd avoid this place, unless you enjoy a good drink rip-off. Also, the restaurant was half empty but the waitress made a big to-do about if they have room and when she can seat us...? weird."}
{"text":"Had the heathy choice with New York strip and risotto.  The risotto was more rice them risotto and everything needed salt.  Very friendly staff will be trying the breakfast tomorrow"}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of weekends ago with my fiance and her parents.  We had reservations for 5:30 but managed to get to the airport early and so were at the restaurant at 5.  Sadly this place does not open up until 5:30  and so we were forced to wait around for a bit in the lobby.  Since this is off of the lobby of the Hyatt there are not too many decorations but it is bright and contains and tone of pleasing neutral colors.  We decided to start off our evening by splitting the local cheese & charcuterie plate. It was good with a couple of different kinds of cheeses & cured meats as well as some olives.  The meat was nice and salty which paired nicely with the savory of the cheese as is almost always the case with such plates.  For my entree I decided to have the organic chicken mediterranean.  It was pan roasted with garlic, red pepper, onion and artichoke hearts over some whole wheat.  The chicken was good and moist and It was a solid dish that tasted pretty good but it didn't have any special that would make me want to recommend it to anyone.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely come back here again in the future.  Both the food and space that it occupies are nice, now if I only didn't have to pay for airport parking to eat here."}
{"text":"I am not reviewing the restaurant per se or the hotel, which I actually find to be a bit loud.    I am reviewing the slow-cooked pork sandwich that I just ate at the bar, which may rank as one if the best I've ever had.  Period.  Like really good.  Like, \"Oh my god\" good.    Pork spilling over the sides.  Of course.  It has saut√©ed banana peppers on it.  Oh my, so spicy.  It has German coleslaw.  Yeah, baby.  It has a fried egg on top.  I'm done.  Scarfed down in record time.  Ate as I watched the pens lose to St Louis.  Good to see Crosby back, though.   Attached to the airport.  Definitely worth a stop before going to your car."}
