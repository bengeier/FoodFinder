{"text":"Sauce has the kind of thin-sliced pizzas you can't stop grubbing (lol). I usually order the chicken sausage pizza with sweet grilled onions. I believe it's eight slices per pie. They also make those amazingly huge chocolate cookies which you will be tempted to grab and run away with since you can see them there staring at you on the counter next to the cashier. The location is great and the employees are friendly. Their service is quick, in less than 15 minutes they have my pizza ready when I do takeout. Their prices are reasonable. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Sauce is great. I've been here a few times, can't really say I remember what I had (saw the restaurant name in a list and thought I'd write a quick review). The portions aren't overly huge or too small, but they are designed to make you feel full. Each time we went, the food was pretty damn tasty, the service was not too shabby either.   It's a little confusing between ordering your food and them bringing it to you and whether or not you should clear your own table. That's what keeps them from a five star.   The menu is tight and concise so you're not going to stare at it for an hour trying to decide between 8 different dishes. I do remember the first time we went in there I saw the menu and just thought \"everything on here look really good\". The beer selection is a little weak but we really only hit this place up before or after a movie due their proximity to the theater.  Overall it's a great lunch spot. Haven't been there for dinner yet but I am absolutely going to go back to Sauce for more."}
{"text":"Though Sauce isn't the greatest restaurant, it's certainly one of the best in the North Valley. Its casual environment and relaxed atmosphere combined with their great food makes it a local favorite. The prices are fair, maybe a little too high. Their portions are fairly large as well.   All in all, Sauce is certainly a go to restaurant if you're trying to stay in the North Phoenix area, but if you can spend an extra 20 minutes driving towards Central Phoenix, you're bound to find something much better. But Sauce is the perfect dinner and movie date near the Norterra location!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my visit on July 27th, 2015.  I went here for the first time today and must say that I'm a fan. I walked in and noticed it was an order-at-the-counter type of restaurant but they had an amazing variety of food. It was obvious they also catered to those with food allergies, offering both gluten free pizza and pasta. There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try!  In the end, I ordered the mozzarella, fontina, and basil pizza on a thin crust which tasted AMAZING! The staff also seemed nice and were very helpful and proactive in clearing plates and utensils.  Just one complaint: The place was a bit loud for me!  I will absolutely come back to try out some pasta and paninis too!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  I have been to several locations and the food is nothing short of great.  It looks like food from a high end restaurant but the price is very lunch worthy."}
{"text":"Tried the Mac and Cheese based on previous reviews. I ordered the full order for take out.Previous reviews comment about how much food the full order is. I had debated whether I should get the full or half order, and decided to splurge. It came in a large take-out container, but the container was less than half full. Did they run out? he pasta was very al dente, and half the noodles were dry, there was barely any cheese sauce. Nothing had any flavor, the noodles nor the sauce. I had to doctor it up when I got home. Was super disappointed, because I love a good mac & cheese. The bread was good though!"}
{"text":"Service at this location is horrible. I love Sauce and their food but every time I go to this location, I always have a problem with service. The headache is not worth the food. I would rather go out of my way to another location then go to this location."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here for dinner one night during the week. It was not too crowded. The cashier gave recommendations for pizzas and salads. They talked us into the combo for two which included a shared pizza and salad and two glasses of wine. It was the perfect portion and the pairing was perfect.   They could easily get away with higher prices because the quality of food is that amazing.   The location is perfect too because it is just outside the mall so you can  hit up the mall first then satisfy your hunger at Sauce afterward. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Didnt seem that Chris was doing much to get the food out and help certain customers. Wasn't interested in making my experience here any better. He simply answered my questions to make me go away but didn't give me any actual answers. He told me my pizza was already at my table when it clearly wasn't. Travis stepped up to the plate and took the initiative to actually go behind the counter and get my pizza out to me. Travis was awesome and got my pizza out after 20 minutes of waiting."}
{"text":"Sauce is great, they have a simple and unique menu that is reasonably priced. Delicious thin crust pizzas, fresh salads, and great big balls! Meat balls, that is. The staff is pleasant and attentive. You never have to wait to long, but you wouldn't mind even if they did with the eye candy making pizzas ;) My only criticism would be that 80% of the people I have ever seen there are loud teenagers, which is too be expected when being so close to the mall, but still, not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious pizza, salad, appetizers, wine... Friendly service. This is one of the restaurants I take out of town guests for lunch because I know it's always good!"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome - food is always great and the service very friendly.  Love the turkey and feta salad (sub chicken for me!)"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this location, the whole experience did not start off well. We went to sit down after ordering, we found a table, but it was dirty. We saw a girl wiping down tables who made eye contact with us, but she was not interested in cleaning our table. We decided we would have to inconvenience her and ask. We waited quite a while on our pizzas, so we were quite happy when they came out. Right away, I went to pick up a piece and the pizza was not barely a hint of warmth, obviously they were sitting around for a while. We returned the pizzas, waited what seemed like another 20 minutes, finally my wife and I both asked for status on our pizzas.   My wife went to another wait staff that was very friendly and went out  of his way to make things right. He was super customer friendly and apologetic, the manager showed up shortly after we spoke with this nice guy (did not catch name =( ) with our pizzas that were fresh from the oven. She even wiped our entire meal, which included my two beers and gave us the meal for free.  Originally I was going to really hammer Sauce, but since the manager and the waiter gentleman really turned everything around for us. That is the only reason I gave a 4 star review instead of 5."}
{"text":"One of the first places I have been to down in AZ and I must say the LAWD has defiantly blessed this place with an abundance of goodness for your taste buds. The mac and cheese is the way to go. The staff is very helpful and the food always comes out to their standard. Love it!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I were excited by the menu... a little on the pricey side, but we don't mind paying as long as the food is up to par. Well, this place didn't quite make the mark. Almost thirty bucks for 2 sandwiches, one salad, and a drink is a bit extreme, especially when the \"crusty bread\" was hard as a rock and the salad completely lacked in flavor. The only good thing about this place was the tea. Oh well."}
{"text":"I like Sauce! It's like an odd remix of a fast food restaurant. Loud, bright, and fast, but at the same time hip and full of tasty Italian food! I think the funniest part is that there is a television inside and it is always tuned into Food Network. Sometimes I watch it when I'm in there and it's like \"Look! Here is all this other food you could be eating!\"  The pizza comes on a super thin, crunchy crust and is satisfactory in flavor. The mac n' cheese is super tasty, although I could probably make it at home if I really tried. My favorite stand-out item is the goat cheese, artichoke, and mushroom bruschetta appetizer, although I could probably also make this at home (not that I ever would have thought of it!). It is such a great combo of crunchy, warm bread and soft goat cheese!   The food comes fast and is pretty affordable! A good place to grab a bite to eat if you're in a bit of a hurry."}
{"text":"First lunch for the New Year!  Although we were pleased with the food, we were disappointed with the wait time for the pizza, which took 45 minutes!  Other family members were done with their meals and the pizza wasn't out yet!  Not a very pleasing first lunch for the year."}
{"text":"Although Sauce is a chain and they have several locations in the valley I would go out of my way for this location. My husband and I came in on a Sunday afternoon, we ordered 2 pasta sides the red sauce with mozzarella and the Mac n' cheese which were both awesome!   We just barely began to notice it was taking a little while for our pizza to come out when the manager(?) came over and apologized because the pizza had been brought to the wrong table and he had taken it off our tab (which we had already paid)!   All the staff was awesome and really went above and beyond.   And all this is coming from a server of a high volume restaurant downtown.   Would come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. When their pizza oven malfunctioned, they gave me a free pasta dish and then remade my pizza when they fixed the oven. They refunded me the cost of the pizza because of the wait and sent me away feeling cared for as a customer and happily full."}
{"text":"QUALITY spot.  excellent service and management.  pretty much ALL fresh-made food/high-level ingredients.  manages the lunch rush well. (efficient food runners, bussers, etc.)  plenty of parking.  high-ish prices but it's scottsdale and it's worth it for the quality.  solid."}
{"text":"Came here for Mac and Cheese and it's delicious!  Ordered it online for pickup. Food was hot and ready when they said, friendly service.  Exactly what I wanted and expected!  Thanks sauce!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken cesar pizza and halved it with pepperoni and cheese for our girls. It was delicious! First time here and the cashier and service was great. They were very helpful and made some recommendations for us to choose from."}
{"text":"Ok so let's see. Uptown is blowing up right now and I'm always happy to have another restaurant. I'm all about pizza so this fit the bill. Took my kid in tonight to see how it fares.   Overall there's nothing terrible. No horror stories to report. But ironically the pizza place named Sauce had very little sauce on it (our pizza). The ingredients were good but nothing stood out. The service was ok. Friendly but nothing to write home about.   So overall, it's ok. With Federal Pizza close by (and closer to me than Sauce), I don't see myself coming back. Federal beats Sauce in every way I can think of. With Lou Malnati's coming soon (across the street), I feel like Sauce needs to seriously elevate it's game or be relegated to \"that cheaper pizza place over there\" status."}
{"text":"The overall experience is great. Must say I was pleasantly surprised. Much better then I anticiated. Since liked a chicks place to eat. I went with my wife and I must admit I really liked it. I got a spinach apple salad thingy and it was amazing. Great size portion and actually tasted like a good, healthy salad. The pizza is good and the mac and chheese is great. Overall ambience is nice and was a good place to relax woth freinds or family and enjoy good food. I think it is reasonably priced ( about  $7.50 a person) considering you get great quality food.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This food is delicious, the owner is a stand up guy. Everyone should come here!"}
{"text":"Attentive and friendly service and great food! Suprema pizza, salmon and kale salad, portobello and artichoke, bruschetta,and chocolate chunk cookie are all a must!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. Quality, fresh ingredients. You can taste the smokiness in the roasted red peppers. And the fresh sauce. The thin crust is very thin crust. They alsp have a hand tossed artisan which is a lil thicker. They don't use a lot of sauce on their pizzas, so if you are a sauce person like me, ask them to put on a lil extra. I will def be back. Excited to use the coupon they gave me for $5 off my next delivery order."}
{"text":"I've never been to a pizza place like this one... It was restaurant quality food served in a casual self serve type place. Almost like a wildflower bread company meets a humble pie restaurant.  You stand in line to order your food and your food is served to you. However u get to pick where you sit and had to fill and refill your drinks by yourself.  The food was great, high quality and served quickly.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Salad was ok not much mozzarella or tomato. The bruchetta was good but it came out last after all the other food? The pasta was just plain terrible but the little servers that ran around could not smile or be engaging. \"Pasta?\" she said. Thunk...she dropped it on the table. \"Bread?\" She dropped that and fled. I got up and took the pasta back and asked for the manager. She said she would get me more and she did. Exactly the same as before but hotter. She came by and asked if it was better and when I showed her 9 pastas all gummed together she said she would speak to the kitchen and left.... if I had received a check anywhere else they would have taken that mess off the bill but since I already paid I was just out of luck. Picked around the cooked stuff and left. Bruchetta to go only from now on...."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever trying Sauce... I had a grilled cheese with tomato soup.  It was delicious!  There was lots of cheese in the sandwich, and the soup was the type that is creamier and lighter in color.  It tasted like it may have had red peppers along with the tomatoes but I'm not certain as the menu didn't specify.  Either way, it was tasty!  Pretty happy for the first time getting food here!  ** only complaint about the grilled cheese is it wasn't buttery.... and I prefer them REALLY buttery!"}
{"text":"So dellish! Tried it for the first time today and loved it! The staff was friendly, the place was very clean and the food was so good! totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Last night was the first time ordering from here. The delivery was on time. The food had a lot of flavor. I only gave them 4 stars because I expected better quality and better portion size for how much it cost."}
{"text":"The food here is great but the front desk staff really needs help. Most of them are perfectly nice, but the guy usually on the register (short brown hair) is the rudest, most arrogant, obnoxious person who has ZERO business being in customer service. He constantly gets things mixed up and acts like it's the customers fault. His entire attitude says \"I'm better than you and you're an idiot for requiring my services to take your order\" even though, you know, that's his freaking job. I work nearby so we drop in here very frequently and this guy puts a bad taste in my mouth and my coworkers have made similar observations. If he hates people so much, why did he chose a front of house position? Rethink your choices and stop raining on everyone else's day."}
{"text":"The chicken Mac & Cheese is hands-down the BEST Mac & Cheese EVER. And I've tried quite the variety."}
{"text":"love the chicken broccoli pasta!!! staff is quick and friendly. price is good."}
{"text":"Not great pizza, super greasy and falling apart. Definitely not worth the amount they are charging. They also stood around chatting so by the time i got my pizza it was cold.  Don,t go here. Better off at dominos or pizza hut."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Pizza Hut style pizza, this is not the place for you. This pizza will not be loaded with toppings, soaked by grease, or doughy.   Instead, it is a lovely thin crust pizza, fired to perfection in the wood-burning oven. It is topped with a variety of toppings..shrooms, pepperoni, melon, Caesar salad...you get the drift. The Caesar pizza is delicious and perfect on a hot summer day. Just filling enough, but not to the point where you'll need to roll out of there. Also great is the Artichoke and Portobello mushroom pizza. The pizza is perfectly covered with juuuust enough cheese. The mushrooms and artichokes are perfectly placed.   I think the pizza sauce is key. Hence the name I'm sure. :) Not too salty or acidic, but full of tomato flavor. No chunks, and nothing to get stuck in your teeth.   Definitely consider starting off with a salad, which is the perfect size for sharing.   Salad to share, two sodas, and a pizza - 20 bucks."}
{"text":"I like sauce, but I'm going to give them 1 star for thinking it's ok to burn a pizza, box it up and not mention it to me when I came in to pick it up. I'm now home and practically snapping my teeth when I take a bite. I'm too tired to take it back and demand they make another. Poor decision on their part to pull this crap."}
{"text":"This is great! I stopped here for lunch and had one of the salad and pasta lunch specials. The salad with mixed greens, chicken, pine nuts, gorgonzola cheese, and tomatoes was delicious! My pasta was also very good. It was the perfect portion size and also came with a drink and bread---all for $8! I was impressed."}
{"text":"Simple fare done really well.  A few signature pies and sandwiches that delve into the gourmet tastes but not so far as to make you shy away if your less adventurous. The Mac n Cheese is worthy but closer to an alfredo sauce than the classic cheddar or american normally seen, perfectly accompanied by a crusty airfilled ciabatta roll. They're wood fired pizza offerings are perfect lite fare for sharing or keep it toyourself and savor the fresh ingredients.  We had the potato feta olive tepinade pizza and it was so satisfying but never heavy, a must try.  I used their phone ahead service and had 2 toddlers in tow they were supper helpful, and even filled fountain drinks for us, they took the time to confirm every item in the bag physically and offer any condiment or utensile.   I think the food alone warrants eating here, but the attention to detail and overall coutesy needs to be admired, too many times restaurants and retail forget they are a service industry and aside from serving food they should be welcoming and inviting.  Suace is and on every visit reminds me why we come back.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after hearing so many good reviews. However it was quite a strange experience. My husband ordered the mac and cheese and I ordered a summer veggie salad. We waited about 15-20 minutes and they brought out his mac and cheese (which was almost cheese-less) and a stale roll that tasted like the ones from a high school cafeteria. I expected my salad to come out right behind. The waitress sure didn't say anything about it. Another 15 minutes went by.. My husband was almost done with his food by then, and then my food arrived. The salad was pretty good, but the waitress didn't even apologize for the wait. It is a little strange to send food for the same table out at different times. I don't think the food was worth the money and I don't know if that I will ever return."}
{"text":"love this place so much.  they have the best mac and cheese.  my husband and son are always wanting sauce when we do take out nights.  there is not much i can eat there being gluten free.  there salads are great.  the staff is super friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"The Caesar salad is delish!! I get it every time! I love the margarita-like pizza.  The fountain drink cups are super cute and the staff is very friendly and helpful! You get a complimentary bread with butter and it's very yummy, like fresh Italian bread.  I would recommend if you want a great environment and a fairly cheap meal."}

{"text":"Love it here! Great, quick food and friendly service. A regulations spot for lunch.  Reasonable prices, too."}
{"text":"This should be a five star review because we love the food and the staff.  We enjoy the lasagna a little too much though...and apparently others do as well. Unfortunately, they can only prepare a small number per hour, and at least 50% of the time we dine at Sauce they are out. Frustrating to say the least!!! Hard to go to one of your favorite restaurants and feel like it's a crap shoot if you are going to be able to order your favorite dish!!  Until they find a way to resolve the lasagna \"dilemma\", we will have to schedule our dining expeditions to Sauce during off hours.  If they find a way for their kitchen to consistently provide lasagna throughout the day....5 stars all the way!!!  One can only hope!!!"}
{"text":"Pump the breaks. I was in the mood to see pasta shells the size of my ears, and sauce gave me what I wanted!  I have been to sauce several times and loved each and every time! I don't go often since I can't seem to stay away from that dang macaroni and cheese (really shells and cheese). So I go when I'm truly wanting to splurge. It is amazing! the sauce is so cheesy and melty. It's like a cheesy melty goodness! The pizza is always amazing and well made. And the salad is shut your mouth good! You can't beat this place for some quick bistro Italian food. And if you feel like loving your inner fat kid, go pick up the tiramasu. Fan-freakin-tastic!  But here is truly the best part...It is in a great part of town, the restaurant is always super clean, the staff is friendly and welcoming, and they have pasta shells the size of your ears!  I don't know if you can tell or not, but I love this place. It is always a fun spot to go for lunch when you feel like being bad."}
{"text":"go here ALL the time for lunch. very consistent. have tried the pizza, salads, pasta and sandwiches.  healthier than a typical fox restaurants place. good portion sizes, good service/efficient staff. why 4, not 5 stars? it's a pricey menu for a strip mall place, which is fine...but when i pay $12 for the salmon and kale salad, it should really have more kale (it's a 50/50 kale/lettuce mix) and more salmon (they give i'd say half a filet). but look, for the area (lots of malls and offices), this is a good mon-fri option for quick and healthy-ish food.  they could do a better job wiping crumbs off the table and chairs however. the bussers are efficient with the dishes, but not thorough enough with the clean, i.e. wipin' down them CRUMBS. i'm wearing nice clothes friend, don't punk me out.  solid lunch spot."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Excellent and healthy salads.  I would highly recommend for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"My close friends and family are regulars here - we go almost every Friday for dinner and the staff is always, always always top-notch. My go-to is the salmon and kale salad, but you really can't go wrong with any item on their menu! They have great specials in the summer for $20 and there's a lot of different options for kids!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Sauce after leaving the Fairmont hotel's Christmas lights. We were looking for yummy, fast pizza and Sauce was perfect!  We ordered a pepperoni pizza and a sausage pizza and both were great. Also ordered a side salad. Would give it 5 stars but kids declared the crust too \"crunchy and flaky and charred\" and husband declared the salad \"had too many weeds in it\".  Other than that...perfect. Hot, yummy, fast pizza."}
{"text":"Wow didn't know it was possible to screw up an order so bad. I was in a rush and grabbed my to go order quickly and left without double checking my order was correct. (My first mistake) Half way home I realize there's a whole item missing from my bag so I turn around and go back to get the missing item and then make my way home again. Once I get back and open up the boxes I find out they gave us a completely wrong order!! We ordered the bruschetta and instead find a Caesar salad and instead of my turkey feta salad I find a different salad that I can't even eat because it has avocado in it (which I am allergic too). My advice is if you must order take out from Sauce, double and triple check it before leaving the store! But it's safe to say I will never be returning."}
{"text":"Sauce is a fast-casual concept chain with quite a few Valley locations, serving up primarily pizza with some other Italian dishes on the menu. With the recent expansions, they seem to be doing well. And it makes sense, because the pizza is solid.   Sauce offers you two different styles of pizza: hand tossed or thin crust. I can say I much prefer the thin crust style which is essentially a very well done bar-style pizza. Ironically, for a restaurant called \"Sauce\", it's pretty much all cheese. It's not a bad thing, because the mozzarella really packs a nice flavorful punch. It's not overcheesed, but it is definitely cheese-centric. There's a slight layer of grease but it wasn't overpowering or too much. The cheese was slightly dusted with basil on my pizza and it was a nice complement. A lot of the pizzas combine mozzarella with fontina for a nice blend of cheese flavors.   As for the sauce, I really can't say much about it because it doesn't come through in the pizza. It really blended and hid behind the great taste of the cheese. Again, not a bad thing. The crust was similarly average. On the thin crust pizza, it forms a really nice texture on the middle base of the pizza, neither too crispy or soft. I loved that. However, the outer crust rim was cracker thin and I couldn't taste much besides that it was slightly burnt. That's kind of the bargain with bar style pizza though, so if you're looking for a nice outer-crust go for the hand-tossed style.   My main concern with the hand crust style however is the texture on the bottom of the crust. I think they dust the pizza pretty heavily with flour in order to make it easier to transfer in and out of the oven. It's a preference thing, but I hated the texture of burnt raw flour on the bottom of my pizza. I guess I'm a cornmeal guy.  Overall, it just distracted from the overall experience, so I prefer the thin-crust even though it's less food for the same price.   Other menu items were a hit. The bruschetta is some of my favorite around, underlying the classic components with a sweet pesto spread which enhances the flavor. The caesar salad is pretty good but there's nothing special about the macaroni and cheese. Service is always good and the food comes out pretty fast. Haven't tried the wine menu but it's a good selection with affordable prices.   Final verdict: It's good experience for some above average pizza with a good supporting cast. Choose carefully between the crusts and don't expect heaps of sauce, but at the end of the day most people will be very happy with what they get here. Pretty good."}
{"text":"What a great place.  They promote their pizza but their soups and salads are really fantastic. I loved the beet, arugula and quinoa salad as well as the white bean potato soup.  They have such a nice salad selection, I can't wait to go back.  I really love that they serve healthy fresh options.  They have a modest but quality selection of wine and beer as well.  The only downside is that this location is rather loud and the sound echoes across all the hard surfaces. Not a huge deal but it can make table conversation difficult if it is busy.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just came back today, holy moly, this place has PROBLEMS!!  In the 15 minutes I waited in line, 4 different people went up to the food line looking for their food.  One lady commented that she had already been waiting 30 minutes and there was no sign of her food!  This place needs serious help!  Since the sale of Sauce from Fox, this place isn't the same.  I just placed a take out order for a salad and caprese bruschetta and it took 36 minutes!!  The service isn't as sharp and the food is changing.  The bread in the bruschetta is different, thinner and not fresh.  Disappointed, this use to be one of my go to favorites!!  :("}
{"text":"Yum! I love their caprese bruschetta and find myself craving it! The wait is usually pretty long but they can't help it they are so popular! My daughter loves their pasta and red sauce and the pizza is great too. Family friendly but not overrun with little kids."}
{"text":"First off, let me tell you that I'm not a big fan of Italian food, but this place is pretty good. Not just good food but one of the few chains that offer healthier choices. I know, pizza and pasta are not exactly healthy meals to start with. However, Sauce offers a number of nice salads and a drink bar with some low-calorie choices. Portions can also be a little small but that depends on how much you like to eat, I guess.  I'm happy to give this place four stars although since I don't eat Italian food that much, this would not be a first choice for me personally. If you do you like Italian food, it's a great choice."}
{"text":"the summer special deal was great, $20 for a salad pizza and two glasses of wine.  we also got the caprese bruchetta and i think i am in love.  nice people, good atmosphere, clean, quick service and good food.  don't know why we waited so long to try it"}
{"text":"Used to be a big fan of Sauce pizza.  Took a friend to Sauce today for the first time, after raving about it for years.  The pizza was dry and tasteless, and very skimpy on the toppings.  I learned that the chain was sold by Fox Restaurants in January, and that may account for the change in quality.  Sad to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"The last time I had really perfect pizza was at Shakey's in Mankato Minnesota. This of course, was many many years ago and many many pizzas have been eaten since. The thin crust was actually thin and cooked to perfection. This will always be my go-to place for pizza from now on. Good job!"}
{"text":"Saucy. And nearby. Its convenient that it's so close. I cant stress the closeness more."}
{"text":"I go here often for lunch and love their salads and on occasion have had their pizza too.  Both of which are tasty and keep me coming back for more.  Service is touch and go depending on the day, but I have to say that most days are good."}
{"text":"Come here for two things; that awesome sausage & pepperoni pizza and the broccoli chicken pasta. Enough said!"}
{"text":"My best friend took me here my first night in town and it was wonderful. The salads are good and the pizza even better.  We didn't have to wait long for our food.  I heard the pasta dishes are just as good.  The best part is the customer service, from the friendly cashiers, front staff and waiters to the fact that the Manager was walking around and personally asking each table how everything was.  That says a lot, especially these days when customer service is forced and non-existent in most establishments.  I would suggest going here for a good meal and relaxing environment."}
{"text":"While driving down to PF Changs down by Fashion Square for a mothers day lunch, we passed by this place and decided on it instead to try something new. It looked busy outside on the patio so I figured this must be a pretty decent pizza place. I have only been to one other Fox restaurant and that is True Food Kitchen, which I like a lot. This place..... meh.  We walk in, and the first thing I notice to be different is its not a sit down, order, and food is brought to you kind of place. Its a order at the register, wait for food to come out kind of place. Which I was not expecting and frankly it confused me. The prices were extremely high for this kind of establishment. We ordered a few different items. The portabello and artichoke bruschetta, $4.50. Was it worth the money? No way. It was one thick slice of bread spread with a thin layer of goat cheese, topped with a minuscule amount of peppers, artichokes, and hardly any mushrooms. It did taste good, but definitely not a good value for the money. We also ordered the portabello and artichoke pizza $9.75, as well as the mushroom and arugula pizza, $9.75. I don't know where this place gets off charging the amount of money they do for how little food they give you. Their pizzas are a thin crust, with a thin layer of sauce, and a thin layer of cheese and toppings. Do people actually come here on a regular basis and pay this much for such a thin pizza? If they do something must be wrong with them. Either that or they are so dazzled by the Fox name that they don't care where they throw their cash. Now don't get me wrong. The pizzas all tasted really good, but I would not come here again because of the prices of the food here, which is the only reason for the two star review. I don't just review taste, I also review value. And the value here for what you get is none.   Also, places like this that don't pay their employees at least minimum wage really bother me. At the register you pay and they have a tip line. I don't usually tip at these kinds of places where all the service I get is food being brought out to me or if I do I don't tip the usual amount, but I was so flustered by this I had no idea what to do. I even asked the girl do people usually tip, and she told me they were tip based pay employees. Seriously? They don't do anything worth the tip. At that point I felt obligated to tip so I did. And I still feel like I shouldn't have. All in all I spent $34 dollars on about $5 worth of ingredients. I wont be back."}
{"text":"great summer deal! plus the mac & chez rocks!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for a quick meal. Very casual and quick. Everything we have gotten has been perfect. They have the best salads I have ever eaten. The bruschettas are fabulous. The meatball panini is really good, and the pizza is good too. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I am always satisfied here and it is one of my go to spots."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Ca it reminded us of a pizza/Italian version of an upscale Chipolte sylte dining. Not bad. Food was pretty good considering that is was a walk up counter."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my experience here. Delicious food that is very casual and laid back."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I absolutely loved Sauce. My husband and I were regulars at this location until this past year. For whatever reason it has gone downhill hard and fast. I keep going back, thinking maybe things will be better, but time and time again I just keep getting disappointed.   The past few times I've dined-in, our food has taken forever. My kid's Mac and cheese came 20 minutes after I got my turkey and feta salad (that was missing the avocado) and the second time the same situation happened again, except it took 30-40 minutes- for a kids Mac and cheese.  I ordered take out the last two times hoping to avoid such a situation again.   Both times my turkey and feta salad has not had avocado. I can understand if it was a mistake once, but three separate instances and no avo?? It's listed as an ingredient in the salad on the menu so I'm having a hard time understanding why this is an issue.  Tonight (the last straw) I ordered a turkey and feta salad, yet again. Instead of turkey I wanted chicken and no feta cheese. I also ordered a side of the cheesy pasta with broccoli and chicken.   The girl who took my order over the phone repeated this to me. When I got there to pick it up, the guy who took my payment repeated this to me as he put the boxes in the bag.   I got home to find this: -there was feta all over my salad -there was NO AVOCADO  -the cheesy pasta looked like last night's leftovers, the two pieces of broccoli were charred and there were pieces of what looked like blackened brussels sprouts in it? (See for yourself, it tasted like it looks)  I picked the feta off, threw the inedible Mac and cheese away, and decided I'm done giving this place chances. I'm not sure what changed but this establishment is like night and day from what it used to be. I give one star in remembrance of what it was, and one for the staff's friendliness."}
{"text":"Need a place to go for group dates and want some tasty pizza-style grub, check this place out.  I like it for groups because there is no bill splitting happening...it's \"pei wei\" style ordering where you order/pay then find a seat.  This is good for groups so nobody feels weird about having to pay that 40 cents toward my Mt. Dew when they had water :-).  I usually go for the sausage/carmelized pizza.  It's appetizing and filling.  The pizzas come out fast -- don't think you'll be waiting long...they do a good job filling orders quickly (and they are thin crust).  If they have the tomato soup, get it.  When I had it it was some of the best tomato soup I've had and had parmesan chease shaving throughout.  YUM.  I've had the meatball sandwich last time I went and next time I'm sticking with the pizza.  Salads are always great too.  Wife usually gets a salad and I get the Pizza -- then we try to share."}
{"text":"Love Sauce!!  An easy and faster place to stop for a meal and they also have great salads.  Service is good and my kids love the pizza and pasta.  Great food with not as much wait time and good prices."}
{"text":"My favorite place! Love all the choices! Staff is great! Fast and courteous service. Always taking home leftovers!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sauce on many occasions.  I typically get the pizza or will go with a salad.  I ordered a grilled sandwich the last time, and it took over 20 minutes to get to my table.  The person I was eating with was already done when it got to my table.  The food is good, but I just stay away from the sandwiches now and stick to the pizza.   It only gets 3 stars though, because the pizzas are kinda small for the price.  I would rather go to grimaldis if I want a pizza."}
{"text":"The absolute nicest Sauce employees you'll ever meet! Great food and service as always :)"}
{"text":"I've seen this concept popping up recently and have had good expierience and unfortunately with \"Sauce\" bad ones as well. Luckily the comradely between other jilted customers almost makes the meal tolerable. Beside the fact that the service for a 12 inch pizza takes about 30 minutes the topping that come on the pizza are slim to none. Keep in mind the restaurant was less than half full. We had many tables around us too complaining of the same issues of lack of toppings and  with peoples meals coming out of the kitchen staggered to the point where there is no possible way for groups to eat together. And now for the kicker..... The pizza was terrible, it left an intolerable bitter after taste. For your money you are better off going to Peter piper pizza or even fired pie down the road. We also found a hair in the pizza. :-/"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and it is one of my favorite spots. Always quick, always good customer service. My go-to (cheat) meal: Chicken caesar salad pizza and mac and cheese. So delicious!!"}
{"text":"Good for a pizza fix when you want something better than delivery. Excellent salads and pasta. Fast service, kid friendly, not too expensive. Solid choice for a semi-quick dinner with the family."}
{"text":"We stopped in here during a shopping trip in Scottsdale. Great casual sleek clean place with affordable pizzas and sammys. I love super crispy thin crust pizzas, so this place was right up my alley. My only complaint: couldn't take our beers out to the patio...they should think about rectifying that problem. Good eats and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Too bad. I was looking forward to the great reviews I'd seen. The food was cold, service was extremely slow, and non-apologetic."}
{"text":"Third time in 4 days! Am I addicted??? Loving salads at Sauce and...GF pizza! Very attentive staff and servers. Sauce is a new favorite for the Currier Clan!"}
{"text":"i have been to sauce a thousand times and up until recently had no reason to think ill of it.  went back just recently after not having been for a while and something happened.  the food was really bad.  what once was a consistent, reliable, and reasonably priced meal has turned into a disappointing rip-off.   fix it sauce, it was fine at one point."}
{"text":"Good food all around. Wild mushroom with arugula is my favorite. The salads are fresh and takeout is quick. Way better than fast food surrounding it."}
{"text":"I have really tried to like this restaurant- two locations, different dishes, multiple trips.  The pizza is dry and gourmet in the wrong way.  Sandwiches are over done and too much.  Their flavor profiles are just not right.   I am not a fan of Fox and this is my least favorite- not that I like any of them.  Humble Pie blows them to pieces."}
{"text":"Ordered lasagna and a chicken Caesar salad.  A pizza came to my friend and we had to tell the waitress that was not what we ordered.  A minute later the lasagna arrived, definitely was microwaved.  Then my friend had to wait 15 minutes for the salad.  Service is pretty awful, food is bland, go to Oregenos in old town for better pizza!"}
{"text":"Sauce is a great gourmet pizza chain. I've eaten at the one at Glendale and 7th Street in Phoenix many times on several trips to the Valley, but stopped at the Waterfront location after some last minute Christmas shopping at Fashion Square (btw, Waterfront is really nice, first time I had been to it). It's very casual; you order at the counter after deciding from a menu on the wall. They have salads, sandwiches, thin crust pizzas, and pastas. I had the chicken pesto, tomato, and aged parmesan pizza. Their pizzas are very simple, with only a few ingredients, but there's a great variety of pizzas. After you order at the counter, they give you a number to put on your table and deliver your food when it is ready. The pizza I ordered was excellent. It had a simple taste to it, but it tasted really good. The only complaint I had about it was there could've been more pesto sauce. Overall, if you're looking for a quick convenient place to eat that has great food, head to Sauce. According to the website, there are 5 Valley locations, 3 Tucson area locations, and one Denver location. Now all they need is a Cleveland area location."}
{"text":"We usually hit this place up when they're running the special for the Summer Sampler. It's a great deal for $20! You get a pizza, salad and two glasses of wine. The pizza is probably 12-14 inches, which is definitely big enough to share. The salad is large enough to share, too, especially when you know that you can't stuff yourself with it because your pizza is coming soon. They do bring out a single roll when they bring the salad, which is weird because the deal is for 2 people. This time we tried the chicken, spinach & apple salad first, which was very good.I think it had gorgonzola cheese on it, and walnuts, too. For our pizza we opted for the chicken pesto, and we were very happy with our decision. It was delicious! I had a glass of Merlot and my wife had a glass of Chardonnay. I wasn't familiar with the label of either wine, but both of ours were good. There is a price cap for the items if you are getting the Summer Sampler, but 90% of the options fall within the allowance. I think the pizzas have to be less than $9.75, the salads have to be less than $7.75 and the wines have to be less than $6. When you add all of the things together, it's still around $30, so there's a $10 savings with the Summer Sampler. That's pretty significant. We'll definitely be returning to Sauce again!"}
{"text":"Visiting from DC and stumbled across this place for lunch - pizza was great as was the summer vegetable salad.  Most notably, the wait staff checked on us twice and manager came to visit and chat.  Great food and experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! There isn't one thing on the menu that I don't like! They have a lot of options and The Mac and cheese is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I just got back from Sauce a little while ago.  I decided I wanted to go there for my birthday dinner because it looked nice and and I saw that it was kid friendly.  So I got my housemates together (which included a nine month old boy) and we headed out.  We got there, walked in, perused the menu and ordered.  I got a chicken, pesto, and parmesan pizza.  One of my mates had the ham and pineapple and the other a mushroom creation.  Both of them said their pizzas were very good.  I had a similar opinion however I would have prefered chicken chunks rather than shredded the way they had it.  I had a nice Shiraz with my pizza which was a good decision.  I liked the location and the modern cafe ambience was very cool too.  The staff was friendly, hip, and pretty (there was a blonde hostess there that kinda got to me in a good way) .  The patrons ran the spectrum as far as what you'd expect in the heart of Scottsdale's \"urban\" core (I must admit I think I fell in love 3-5 times).  After we (barely) finished eating meals our little guy decided he'd had enough and made it clear.  We exploited the ideal location and went for a little walk around Old Town which was a nice way to end the outing.  (+) Food Location Staff Atmosphere  (-) Shredded Chicken"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I loved it! The thin crust pizzas are the best!!! Tried the Chicken Pesto pizza and helped my friend finish her chicken broccoli and cheese pasta! My hubby had the Works Pizza! I love the ambiance... very casual and cozy!! Customer service is great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Their pasta, pizza, and bread rolls are so amazing!  I recently went to Venice, Italy and Sauce is way better than true Italian.  It also is so fast.  This is the best Italian restaurant in AZ.  Must eat!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and awful service. Messed up pizza order and manager was too much of a coward to even comment and just brought the credited receipt by and left.Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"I went on a night where there was a car showing going on so it was soo packed!!!   I waited in a fairly longgg time to order my food.  We sat outside. Very small and cramped. But the food was great. The mac&cheese and caprsi salad. I loved it. Waitress was nice. I will def come back but on a less Busy night i hope... Maybe they should come up with a easier way to order (no lines)"}
{"text":"I recently ate here and it was a great atmosphere. Perfect for an afternoon lunch after a long day of shopping. The quality of their food was very good especially for the price. The whole establishment was very clean and their entire staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable, low maintenance, inexpensive lunch."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat we came here me and my family after a bad experience at a previous bar that day when we were going to order some Italian food and decided against that because of poor service. We came here instead we revived great service and pizza was amazing here we appreciate how you treat your customers you helped change our night for the better at least a little bit"}
{"text":"Love this place. I went here every weekend for a month. Mainly for the spinach apple and walnut salad. It's my favorite. I also like the bruschetta. The pizza is ok. The mac n cheese is ok as well. I really just go for the salad."}
{"text":"Order the Mac n Cheese!  Yummm, Sam Fox. Thank you kind sir.  Yet another fine establishment from Mr. Fox. I went here for lunch with co-workers. They both ordered the chicken n brocholi and RAVED about it. I ordered the Mac n Cheese, naturally... because I'm the youngest in the crew. But the noodles are a funny teacup style. The make a funny noise if you stab them with your fork while they're upside down. But in all seriousness, the sauce is so rich and creamy and really gives the cheddar a new flavor with the pamasean shreads on top. It's heavenly.  The ONLY reason I gave Sauce a 4 instead of a 5 was I was slightly (very slightly) disappointed in the interior. I have been to other Fox establishments and the interior is something to marvel at, but Sauce was just average. The picture do do it justice and it really is a more simple, easier Fox concept. But for being in a strip mall and as delish as it is I wil overlook the simplicity of the decor.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"While the pizza wasn't anything to rave about, the salads, bread, and wine are great. If you're going to do classy fast-food this is definitely the place!"}
{"text":"I stopped into the Sauce at the Norterra shopping center today after the pedicure I recieved in the area. I have eaten at Sauce several times and always get the same thing..the Chicken and Broccoli Pizza, but today I was in them mood to try something different. I got the order togo and ordered the Meatball Panini. I was pleasantly surprised with how tasty and fresh this sandwish tasted. Inside the box the sandwich was in was an italian pepper that helped add a great aroma to the food as well as a giving the sandwich extra flavor. The sandwich came with parmesan and garlic chips that were amazing! I was excited with my afternoon stop at this Sauce location and plan on heading back knowing that I can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Omg. We are obsessed! We ordered pizza from sauce through post mates! Best idea ever!    We made our own pizzas they were so yummy!    The price is right and the crust is to die for!   Short and sweet review tonight!    We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a place where non famous people act like their famous and want to be seen.  It cracks me up every time I see someone eat there and still wearing their sunglasses.  Earth to Scottsdale, this is not LA and never will be.  Look at me, I had lunch at Sauce!  Makes me laugh every time.  I went to the Sauce in Phoenix and it was deicious.  Solid quality, fresh salad and pizza.  However, this Sauce in Scottsdale can be described as average and inconsistent.  I like the cucumber, tomatoe, feta salad.  I got it  2 times and both times were BATHING in dressing.  The balsalmic was so overly proportioned that I actually felt my stomach pH drop another 2 points.  I didn't complain because as I look behind the counter, there was no chef  nor sou chef therefore absolutely zero quality control.  Its only saving grace is that it's across the street from the mall and if you're famished then you can grab a bite.  which is what I did.  I think I'm going to have to stuff half a of head of lettuce in my purse so I can avoid going there out of hunger desperation. I have to clarify that I do that as well, I goto restaurants to be seen and feel cool but I do it in LA at places like The Ivy.  At least my ridulousness is justified when the Hilton sisters were eating their salads next to me."}
{"text":"Went tonight with my family. Ordered All on one ticket. They said my husbands lasagna would take longer. That was fine we ordered a salad so that should give us time to eat our salad. 2 minutes after the salad came out my sandwich came out. I asked his my husbands ready to come out, \" oh yes\". 10 minutes goes by my son gets his dinner. Another 10 minutes no husband dinner. I asked about it, said we had planned to eat as a family.  She said oh well I'll bring you another sandwich so it will be hot when your husband gets his. Ok..... Nope. My husband gets his dinner & the lady says \" oh do you want me to make you a new sandwich now?\"  So now my husband would have to wait to eat his dinner?!?!  I just shut up and ate my cold sandwich.  Meanwhile there are 5 people working there standing around doing nothing. Never again! Pricey & cold."}
{"text":"The turkey avocado salad, caprese bruschetta & sausage and caramelized onion pizzas are my favorite. Great service. Always satisfies!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service in all of Scottsdale.  Restaurant is run by kids who need a summer job. The manager has no understanding and/or concept of running a restaurant business.   Ordered a pasta dish and a pizza. The pasta was out quick in less then ten minutes. Lousy pasta overcooked, sauce tasted sweet like Chef Boyardee.   It took them 30 minutes + to get the pizza, by this time my pasta is cold. Had I not said something to the runner, we would have never gotten pizza.   The manager came over, apologized, said it was her fault. She never once explained what was the reason that a table of 6 that arrived 20 minutes after us had five pizzas served, never comped the dinner, but did offer cookies?!!!!!  IS THIS RESTAURANT A JOKE??? ?  Cookies is going to resolve a service issue????  Where I come from, a round of drinks is offered to alleviate tension, or perhaps the dinner is comped, but COOKIES???  Give me a break...her calling is definitely NOT in the service industry. I think Girl Scouts of America is hiring a cookie maitre d'"}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. Now the food takes over 30 mins for a salad and pasta. The pasta is either ALWAYS undercooked or over cooked. I used to come all the time and now I'm completely writing it off after a 4th time of having horrible service and long wait times. Oh, and if you think ordering take out will help, don't bother. Ordered 4 house salads and ONE pizza to pick up, was quoted 10 mins for order to be ready and ended up going in and having to wait an extra 30 mins for order to be complete. Lost a long time customer since this location has been open.   Also, if someone orders a bottle of white wine, it should always be put in a wine bottle bucket with ice for the table to keep cool."}
{"text":"Yummy salads and very thin crust pizza. Probably the most thin crust I have ever had. The salads are all fresh which I love. This is a great spot for lunch or a light dinner."}
{"text":"Disappointing would be the word I would use to describe our experience at Sauce. This was the worst pizza crust I think I've ever had. It was undercooked and doughy. The toppings were promising, but could not overcome the dough they topped.  My wife's roasted veggie salad was not really roasted but rather seemed to have been kissed by the heat of the oven.  Thus the veggies were warm but mostly raw and coated with dressing.  They need to work the gluten in the hand/tossed crust, truly roast the veggies, and keep the heat properly distributed in the oven."}
{"text":"Went there with one of my friends a while ago and the pizza was amazing!  Walk in, order at the counter, then you find a seat and they bring the food to you.  I hadn't been to one in Scottsdale yet, but I did go to one in Tucson.  This one was a little dirtier, almost each tables was covered in crumbs and the soda machines was all wet, which is why I deduced one star.  The crust was perfectly baked and had just the right amount of crunchiness to it.  Got our pizza with mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni.  (One of my favorite combination for pizza)  It was only missing some olives...  But, great place for a good bite of Italian to eat!"}
{"text":"For what it is, cheap easy family friendly food with a bit of a yuppie bend, its not bad.  But they messed up a grilled cheese sandwich. How do you do that? My mom, god bless her, can't cook to save her life. None the less, she can still make a pretty damn good grilled cheese.  Its not rocket science. Let me walk Sauce through this: - Cut slices of cheese. Precut is pretty gross. - Put bread around cheese. - Apply butter to the outside. - Grill til melted.  Yet, my girlfriend's grilled cheese was horrible. Bad bread, thin on the cheese, and it tasted like heated cat turds.  I'm just not that impressed. I know lots of you love this place, but I don't for the life of me know why.  It would have been 1 star, but the mac n' cheese bought it an extra star.   Why is it so hard to find good pizza in Phoenix. You'd think with its mob proximity to Las Vegas that it'd have better Italian food. And yet, not so much. I blame the Mormon influence on this town. Too many years of Kraft products and special underwear have really killed the food talent here."}
{"text":"I was looking for another restaurant but was too tired and it was too hot and passed by Sauce and thought it looked good.  I ordered a panini with a side salad and it was delicious.  Definitely exceeds expectations and is upscale casual with a super relaxed atmosphere.  Food comes quick, too."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  The food is gourmet and not expensive at all.  It's a very relaxed atmosphere and kids are welcome but you still get an elegant feel somehow without any stress.  The meatball panini is superb.  The ice tea is very good.  The nutella trifle is a perfect ending."}
{"text":"We were hungry for pizza, and decided to try Sauce.  We really didn't know what to expect, as were just in the area, and had heard of it before.    When you enter, there is a menu on the wall that you read while waiting in line to order at the cash register.  After you place your order, you find a seat. Very minimal decor, almost a cafeteria feeling to it. From the menu, they also offer paninis and salads. But we were only interested in pizza.  The pizza is thin crust style.  I have not had much experience with thin crust pizza, but I did like it - in fact, that is the one thing I will remember about Sauce - that the crust on their pizza was delicious.  The sauce and toppings were all right, but not memorable; but I will come back just for the crust.  My main concern is it is not as filling as other styles of pizza and leaves me hungry for more, and I am not a big eater.  So I would recommend it for lunch or a light meal."}
{"text":"Since when are non service dogs allowed in this establishment? A golden doodle with a tutu? Really?! The employees including the manager felt it necessary to go and pet the dog- gross!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here. I spent 9.75 on a pizza my friend and I shared. I was super impressed. Loved the pizza and the service. I will return with more friends :)"}
{"text":"Always a good experience the tomato soup is excellent and the employees are very pleasant perfect for lunch dinner by yourself or with a group!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Sauce at Dana Park for years. We actually went here on our first date.   The food is always consistent and tasty. My wife loves the Chicken Caesar Pizza as well as the Lasagna. I always get either the Meatball Panini or a thin crust Pepperoni and Caramelized Onion Pizza. Or sometimes both.  The main reason we love this Sauce though is the service. Always friendly and helpful. Accurate and quick. We always see Justin, the GM, whenever we are there. He is so kind and genuinely cares about our family.   Always a great time at Sauce."}
{"text":"This is a brand new Sauce location and I have been very pleased with the service and quality of food all three times I have been here! The customer service is so incredible. The workers really care about helping you and will do whatever it takes to get your order right and will even refund you if you do not like your food or there is a mess up. This is one of my favorite spots! Great job to the managing team."}
{"text":"Clean, classic Italian decor, great service, delicious food, and fresh flowers! They had me at flowers, and beautiful Tuscan colors. Even the bathrooms are super nice!"}
{"text":"I placed a to go order it was a side salad and meatballs and spaghetti or curly noodles the five dollar and 50 side salad was just greens with some croutons not really worth five dollars the noodles were soggy and the meatballs were dry paying $15 for this meal I feel very disappointed and probably will not go  back to sauce again."}
{"text":"Blah food...really bad pizza...like cardboard...no taste...Mr. Fox you need to fix this ...very disappointed will never return to any of your locations"}
{"text":"Fast food meets fine(ish) dining - a bit bizarre in my book.   It's a strange combination.  Wine.....with your fast food.  Dinner rolls .....served in paper bags.    Though I will say the food was decent.  The hubs and I got 2 different pizzas and a salad to share.   Their cheese pizza was pretty good - the fresh basil is a nice touch.  And my hubs enjoyed his spinach-topped pie as well. While the food was tasty I thought the prices were a titch high - especially since you're not getting regular table service."}
{"text":"Typically they are awesome with the food but today I got the same thing I always did, chicken,broccoli and cheese sauce. It was dry and the chicken tasted burnt and the broccoli tasted crispy. Not please with my visit besides the hostess."}
{"text":"Good mozzarella fontina and basil pizza. Good spicy turkey sausage pizza. this is in our opinion the best balance between consistently good food and convenience in this Happy Valley."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  Service=5. The gal taking our order was friendly and helpful; ditto for everyone else who served us.  Appetizer=5. Roasted portobello and artichoke bruschetta was great! Vegetable salad=4. The contents were good but I felt it needed something to make it pop.  Red sauce and mozzarella pasta=4. The pasta shells were on point. The sauce though tasted similar to the marinara sauce at Costco.  Molly's Caramelized Creation pizza= 5. We substituted the bacon for mushrooms but it was delicious. I imagine it would have been even more so with the bacon. The rolls= 3. Taste of bread was good but it was very hard. Maybe if they warmed it a bit prior to serving...  Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sauce Pizza and Wine many of times. I have been to this location and the location on Baseline in Mesa (which I actually like more). It is an easy option for a quick and good meal after shopping and I overall recommend it to anyone. Who can say no to Italian?  I decided to come today to grab a quick lunch with a friend. This is an order-at-the-counter kind of restaurant so it is convenient if you don't have a lot of time or are on a lunch break. I've never had to wait for a seat here, but I'm sure during lunch hour it gets busier which might lead to a 10-15 minute wait. When you walk in there is a big menu on the chalk board wall that is easy to read, organized, and simple. You then order at the counter, they give you a number, and you pick your own seat. There is generous inside and outside seating. The overall ambience of the restaurant is comfy and clean.  We decided to sit outside on the patio. The food came quick, but in a timely matter and we were hungry so we were happy about that. I got the Italian chopped salad and my friend got a pizza with mushrooms. Each of the entrees comes with a complementary bread roll and butter, which is delicious. I liked the meat and cheese in my salad. It was good, but it had too much dressing on it which made it soggy. I usually ask for it on the side and forgot, so my fault. But, I probably wouldn't get that salad again. My friend's pizza was thin crust and I tried it, it was very good. They both are a pretty generous portion. I have also tried the Mac and Cheese here which I get with broccoli and chicken and it is really really good. I have also tried all their bruschetta. I definitely recommend both of them. Each of the entrees are priced around 8-13 dollars which is reasonable especially because the portions are pretty big.   The service was great. The guy who took my order was friendly enough and helpful. He offered me a cup for water which was nice. The girl who brought our food was really great though. I'm not sure what her name was. But she offered to have them remake the salad for me, which I appreciated a lot but declined since it was technically my fault for not asking for the dressing on the side. She brought my friend a side of ranch and told us if we needed anything else to just let her know. She seemed genuinely happy to serve us and make sure our experience was as good as possible.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. It is in a good location for anyone that is at the mall looking for something good to eat. It is a quick and easy option for lunch or dinner. It also is kid and family friendly."}
{"text":"Great variety of food, good prices and excellent service.  I had the roast beef & mozzarella panini.   It had a lot of meat, the bread was fresh and the entire panini tasted great."}
{"text":"I've been to many Sauce locations and orginally loved the one located in the Norterra shopping center but after coming this one a few times, I'm blown away.  The people who work here are great people. They always are smiling and say good bye when we leave. The food is the same as any other location but thats how I know it will always be good. If you looking for a pizza choice, go with the chicken pesto. Delish! For pasta I go with the mac & cheese with grilled chicken.  My only wish is that they would add to the menu wall the options to create your own pizza. Its on the menus by the registers but by then I've already settled on something else."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very quick but service is a little lacking. If you're looking for a quick but very tasty bite for a reasonable price stop in! Note: This place is self service on drinks, not full service."}
{"text":"I have dined in at Sauce probably twice a week for the last three years. It is easy and convenient for me because I work walking distance. I believe they changed owners or management or something?? but it has gone down hill, tables always dirty, portions smaller, employees looking like they don't know what to do (maybe try wiping a table??) I don't know. I still love the place, always think okay maybe it will be better this time.. Very inconsistent, hope they figure it out."}
{"text":"Fun, Fast, Easy, Yummy.  Nice Flatbread style pizzaz, done right, crispy, not thick & greasy. Yummy fresh & unique toppings.  Crisp salads.  Good place for kids :-)"}
{"text":"I tried this place after receiving a coupon in the Norterra flyer. I wasn't disappointed. This place has really good pizza and salads! Service was very speedy and their food was excellent. We ended up splitting a salad and a pizza and still had food to take home! Sauce also servers wine and beer which really compliments the food. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"I like Sauce for the convenience. The pizza is ok but the Mac n Cheese is very delicious! I would never think to order that at a pizza place but my friend ordered it once and I was hooked. I also like the tiramisu which is good and easy to pick up; however, I stopped by a week ago and apparently they no longer serve tiramisu at this location :(. I was pretty disappointed so I don't see me going back as often."}
{"text":"This location has gotten much better over time! I like it better than when it was a fox concept! Food is always good, fresh, and high quality! In also a huge huge fan of their tea--way to go on choosing passport tea in green, red, and black varieties. Love having the chance to get a good salad (my fav is chicken and pine nuts) and a delicious green tea at a reasonable price! When you add in Costco having discounted gift cards this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Another place where frankly, I just don't get the hype. Pizza wasn't very good, and so it was like bark. The mac n cheese wasn't great either. I was disappointed, and the ambiance wasn't great either."}
{"text":"This place is so good. But I just ordered the pasta spicy chicken sausage with cheese sauce to go and there isn't cheese sauce in the pasta. Now if there is it's so very little compared to when I dined in. But I'm almost certain there isn't any because it taste plain and spicy - no cheese? :-("}
{"text":"I wish I read these reviews first...my bad.  Being from South Jersey...just across the bridge from Philly...I know a thing or two about good Pizza...and Sauce is NOT it. Had I known it was cafeteria style...that would've been enough for me to not bother and go to a real restaurant.  I'm the furthest from snobbery...Now to the food...in a word...rip-off.  I ordered the carmelized onion and sausage pizza...had to search for those...including cheese...then...I went to put on some hot pepper...the lid came off and covered the pizza (not a hard feat to do...looked like it was made for \"mini-me\") and table where I sat...no one ever asked if things were ok.  My daughter took the plate and showed it to them...we did get another pizza...but then to my amazement...one of the runners saw it and left...it was still all over the table when we left.  I was told they don't have waitresses...apparently no one cleans tables until you leave so the next cattle call for cafeteria seating can be ready to sit in those tacky plastic chairs. Will I go back...just as soon as pigs fly out of my *ss."}
{"text":"This was our second visit and first time with our kiddos. It will be our last!  Definitely not up to par with other FRC eateries we've been to.   Pizza took forever to arrive (nearly 30 minutes) with nothing but our drinks to hold us thru. Our kids were excited to order chicken noodle soup, which arrived after about 15 minutes but very disappointed with the quantity of vegetables and lack of noodles and chicken. They picked thru it, with their forks and fingers (first place I've been where soup arrived without a spoon) and they were not happy.   The two star rating is being generous given the service we received during our $42 lunch tab. During our wait I noticed how slowly the tables were bussed and was amazed at how the wait staff was so disengaged, like they would all rather be somewhere else. We noticed the manager talked with several tables, it didn't look to be a good day for him.   When our pizza did arrive it was delicious but we were not given any plates, napkins, etc so we grabbed some from another nearby table. Very odd.   My husband asked one of the wait staff about the soup and the manager came over to tell us how delicious it was. Not to our kids! We asked for a kids order of mac and cheese, split onto two plates. He promised it would be right over. It never made it!  We quickly ate our pizza; our kids wanted nothing to do with that! For some reason mine had green pepper instead of artichokes but I wasn't about to send it back. The kids had ordered chocolate chip cookies which came eventually and that was pretty much their meal. Really sad!  We didn't stay and wait for the mac and cheese. My son spilled his drink and we tried to clean it up by ourselves with the scant napkins we had. There were no napkins available at the drink station and no staff wanting to help so we left.   Total bust for my Mother's Day lunch. Never going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a place you'd go for a night out but a really great meal.  Piazza was excellent and I've never had better mac 'n cheese.  Served the wine in a juice type glass which gave it nice authentic Italian cafe touch.  Cheesecake and tiramisu were excellent.  If you're looking for a quick no frills lunch or dinner you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'd eaten here before, and remembered the pizza being crispy, and service being quick even though the place was full. Not today, my friends, not today. Sloooooooowwwww service, and not too helpful. Pizza was good once it got to us... but by then we probably would've eaten cardboard with artichokes ans spinach and not noticed. I don't think I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Sauce a few times now. Everyime we visit, it is a terrific experience. The pizza and salads are delicious and fresh, perfect portion sizes, and the decor is very Italian inspired. The prices are just right, with a menu that's very easy to read. They offer the basics, and they are fabulous. The decor is very cozy and inviting, with outdoor seating as well. The staff is exceptional! From the person taking your order, to the person delivering, they are super friendly, and inviting. They always have a smile on their faces, and genuinely seem to be enjoying where they work. We will definitely continue to dine at Sauce!  P.S. Their tiramisu is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in my experiece here in early August.  Two orders were placed in my name for pick-up, one by phone and one through the online process 6 hours in advance.  When I arrived, the staff were initially unable to find the online order and then when it was located, the pizza hadn't even been started.  The pick-up time was strategized around a group meeting so I was late due to the additional 20 minute wait.  An offer of a beverage for the inconvenience would've been a nice gesture, but there was barely an apology.  The pizzas were fine in terms of taste, but the service was really poor.  Not sure I'll return."}
{"text":"My one experience with Sauce was average.  I got the prosciutto and melon pizza and my partner got the mozzarella and fontina cheese and basil pizza.  His pizza was very good, but nothing special.  Mine left a lot to be desired.  The prosciutto was ample and great tasting, but that's about where the good stuff ended.  The melon, while very fresh, was in huge twisted thin slices on top of the pizza.  This made it look pretty, but it was impossible to eat.  The slices kept sliding off the pizza, so I had to eat it separately from the rest of the pizza, which pretty much defeats the purpose of a pizza with toppings.  In addition, the pizza was very dry.  The menu indicated the pizza would have no red sauce, which was fine, but I expected some sort of moisture.  There was nearly none.  On top of it, while my partner's pizza was moist and had soft crust edges, mine were rock hard and there were big hard bubbles on parts of my pizza.  I ended up taking a few bites out of each piece and leaving a good quarter of each slice behind as it was just too dry and hard.  I was disappointed.  Other than the food, the service was pretty good and the manager very responsive.  We had ordered a dessert (cheesecake, which most definitely tasted frozen, by the way) and after twenty minutes of waiting after our pizzas were cleared, it still hadn't shown up.  I approached the manager and she apologized and got the dessert out to us immediately.  The ambiance was so-so.  The place is very modern and nice looking, but some of the tables are crunched together and something has to be slightly off with the acoustics because it was very loud, just from regular conversations.  Overall, I probably wouldn't return.  While the service was good and employees were friendly, the food was only average and to me, not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Will be the last time we go here, which is sad, as it used to be good.  Pasta hasn't been fully cooked in our last 3 visits.  This time, my broccoli also tasted terrible.  Mentioned it to someone, who I assume was the supervisor/manager, and she over to remake it, which I declined as I was sure nothing would change.  My husband and sons pasta was also not fully cooked.  You would think at that point, she would offer a refund.  But not so much.  She didn't really seem to care.  Overall quality and presentation of food has steadily declined over the last year."}
{"text":"I love all their pizzas. I think their salads are even better. I've been coming here for a long time and the manager always goes out of his way to make us happy!"}
{"text":"Sauce is good. The pizza is always reliable and the service has always been good as well. We don't go for dinner, its only for lunch for us. Chicken Caesar Pizza is good with nice big shaved pieces of parmesan. The pine nut salad is tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have not had a single thing I didn't like. Super fast and easy for my lunch beak."}
{"text":"I like this concept. It is our neighborhood fav. I would usually share all my feedback during my visit with management and trust it would be received and opportunities would be addressed and absolved. I want this to continue to be a go to spot for my family however I feel that upper level management might need to get involved. There have been some changes over the past year that I personally don't feel are improvements. They redecorated and painted the walls grey- not a big deal but I feel the whole staff has that dreary grey feel. The panini bread changed-not for the better now more like a burger bun. Plate-ware changed which I do like and salads got bigger which is better value however it is almost like the chefs have a heavy hand with the lettuce. Balance and portion control are important to recipe adherence and consistent quality. Which is where I feel they are sliding in the attention to detail with the current staff. After ordering, we went to wash our hands to get ready to eat. When I sat down my wife asked was your bathroom dirty? Yes! Garbage all over the floor and it looked like a mechanic had washed his hands several hours prior. It was just before noon. My wife responded \"ugh! I had to go to the bathroom but just couldn't bring my self to get close to the toilet\". The doors to the restroom need cleaning! Then our food arrived. I had the salmon and kale and it was very fishy! The salmon was over shredded globs. I really am not that picky - but couldn't eat it. They graciously took care of this with another salad. My wife's Lasagna arrived with the Mac n Cheese and it usually comes last. This time the thin crust pizza for my son came last-about 5 minutes after everything else. Mentionable because the Lasagna( my wife's fav) was under baked and cold. Cheese on top barely melted. As we looked around. Dining room had debris on the floor under the tables and crumbs on the seats-those tables that had been reset. Remember this is before even the lunch rush started. Condiments not refilled- our pepper mill was empty and had to borrow from another table. Please bring attention to your staff these details that take away from the dining experience. We want to continue coming!!!"}
{"text":"The paninis are ok, except for the meatball panini, each half of the sandwich has one small meatball on it and sauce is very pedestrian. Salads are always a good bet and the grocery store wine selection is passable if you want to drop a 20 on bottom shelf Chardonnay.   If I never go there again I wouldn't even notice, but I wouldn't turn down an invite to go at the same time."}
{"text":"Zero customer service once we sat down. Took nearly 10 minutes between each meal brought out. Panini was semi cold, lunch meat inside was cold and was not worth $8.00. If I hadn't tried my friends pasta it would have earned a 1."}
{"text":"Their food is super delicious & always hits the spot highly recommend a date night here!"}
{"text":"Odd that this place is called sauce since there wasn't any on my pizza. With tip and a glass of wine, $30 for a gluten free pizza with barely any sauce, sparse veggies (since evidently, in order to get a veggie pizza, you have to order each veggie individually for $1.50 each), and a crust that was burnt on the edges and bottom and the consistency of cardboard. I've had many gluten free pizzas over the years and this was, by far, the worst. Also, a 45 minute wait to get said pizza- I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Food always great here. The beet salad is delicious. Pizzas are always good.  They do a great caprese salad. And the teas here, in particular the green tea, is spectacular. I love the casual nature of the dining. Always able to find a place to sit. We are huge fans."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients at reasonable prices. The staff is always pleasant to be around. I ate lunch out every day this is one of my three favorite places. Also good for dinner at a reasonable price. May want to be careful of the Redwine is frequently served warm."}
{"text":"Great thin crust. Always great. Salads are to die for. A casual place to eat."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for my work travels and needed someplace for lunch my first day in town. One of the office staff where I'm visiting mentions Sauce so I take her up on it. Nice menu to start off with, with chopped salads, paninis and pizzas, all very good sounding. So I order me a salami, turkey, prosciutto and mozzarella panini. Not bad, came with some amazing garlic Parmesan chips. I wish though that I had tried the pizza. No problem! I went back the next day with some of the other folks in the office and ordered a prosciutto and melon pizza. Good stuff! This isn't your typical \"slice\" type, it's Fo Sho fancy. But then, you could probably tell that by the prosciutto and melon bit. Good amount of toppings, not overwhelming in quantity but definitely not skimping. The crust is thin and crunchy, but not in a bad way. If you like your pizza the traditional saucy cheesy way only, this isn't for you. But for some interesting foodie-style pizza this is the way to go.  They serve wine and beer here as well, but I'm thinking with the walk-up cafe style ambience it's not a place you go for hanging out other than for a meal with a drink. I'd give this place another try for sure so I can try some of their other pizzas. Word of caution: there's only a couple of tables on the patio that have umbrellas so if you don't want to get baked by the sun, stay inside but try to get there before 12:30 if you're going for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Love The Sauce...What Can You Say...It's In Dana Park TheName Is Sauce & Who Doesn't Love A Finer Pizza!"}
{"text":"Food was sub par at best... but the service don't get me started the \"server\" yelled at me for asking him to do his job. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask a \"server\" to clear a table, but that is too much to ask at this institution.   Awful.  They also don't give us plates so we had to use NAPKINS."}
{"text":"The service was good and fast. I wasn't thrilled about the food. Maybe it's just me, but not to my liking as it seemed to basic and not very flavorful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have made several attempts now to enjoy the food at Sauce. Unfortunately we have now removed this Italian themed bastard step child of the Fox Restaurant Concepts family. The place just plainly sucks. Service is lackluster and so is the food. Overpriced,bland and void of any excitement. Highlight of the visit was when the upon paying for my food with a credit card the cashier told me to \"Like, fill out this receipt\", when I asked for clarification he stated \"You need to write in the total, tip and sign, most people tip\". EXCUSE ME! Why would i tip you? I don't tip the cashier at a gas station, and you pal are not even as cheery as the gas station employees I come in contact with. If my food or service was above and beyond in a quick service setting I would certainly tip (being in the service industry for years I know you work for tip). The definition of bad training and customer service.   Then I realized what truly bothers me about this place....the manager is completely lacking any managerial skills or presence in the restaurant. She was dressed sloppily and we thought she was a customer until she asked us how our salads where. My boyfriend have his usual \"Adequate\" and responded with \"Just OK\". She then smiled and scurried away from our table. I see how it is Sauce, you are just trying to be adequate, well that being the goal you are barely meeting it."}
{"text":"This place is okay for fast casual Italian.  Unfortunately on this visit, they misread my order and gave me a regular crust instead of the gluten free I requested. They caught the error but not before I had eaten some of it.  The server was very apologetic and checked back several times."}
{"text":"I ate at the Sauce in the PHX airport and really liked it so I thought I'd take my 10 YO son to this location for lunch one day.    Well, what a disappointment this place was.  The service was slow and the staff were all goofing around and not taking care of the customers.  When our pizzars arrived I was shocked that they weren't nearly as good as the airport location.  There was virtually no cheese on the pizza and they were a little cold when they got there.  To aggravate me even more, I ordered a mushroom and peperoni pizza and it had exactly half the amount of peperoni as my sons peperoni only pizza.  What the heck - you order 2 toppings and you get half as many toppings of each item but still get to pay extra.  Argh!!!!  Not going back - ever."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Arizona! Mac and cheese, thin crust pizza, and salads are some of the best highlights. Reasonably priced and good service as well, doesn't get much better than Sauce."}
{"text":"So yummy! I love their mac n cheese. It's my favorite place to go for mac n cheese! Great place to go when going to the movies at Norterra or shopping in Happy Valley."}
{"text":"Pizza is something everyone enjoys if cooked correctly. This place does just exactly that! Ive only been here once but was greatly impressed with how smoothly things operated, and how delicious the food was. Would highly recommend this establishment to anyone in mesa!"}
{"text":"Gluten free options are amazingly good!!! Garette was so on top of busting tables and was very friendly. Thanks again Sauce Team!!!! You guys are fabulous."}
{"text":"Sauce has really gone downhill big time since FOX Restaurants departure! Often  run out of Lasagna at dinner time, they don't make enough. Forget the Mac n Cheese, next to NO sauce, just butter? They're called Sauce but besides the pasta being over cooked, there was next to no red sauce on the red sauce pasta! Ordered extra sauce but still asked for bowl of sauce! The sauce is tasty, but why so stingy? The pizza is the only reason for one star because it is good cooked in the fire oven. The night manager and wait staff should spend more time concentrating on the food, instead of slapping and fooling around at the counter."}
{"text":"I usually love sauce but the service has really gone down hill... The gentleman at the front this afternoon wouldn't look up at me, he was also rude when asking what I wanted. After we sat down my friend and I asked for more bread he nodded his head and then walked away just to go up front and stand there and do nothing to get more. After our meal we wanted a box and asked another employee if she could grab us a box she just like the gentleman at the front nodded and walked away. After about 10min we saw her standing doing nothing at the front so I ended up getting up to get my own box... Disappointed in this place it used to be my favorite."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have not even tried this place yet. But a friend of mine is coming into town that has celiac and I was hopiong to take her here because I always think it looks good when I see it at the airport and the menu looks great! Unfortunately we will be unable to go because there is no nutrition info on the website and my husband is a Type 1 diabetic and needs to know the carb count on everything he eats so he can adjust his insulin levels accordingly. I find it very strange that a modern restaurant doesn't offer nutrition info in this day and age. I am sure we are not the only people who need to know this info in order to eat here. So, despite the fact that we would love to try this place, we won't be able to. :("}
{"text":"Been here 2 times now.  Both were solid experiences.  Pizzas are light and crispy.  Salads are fresh and good portions.  Tried the bruschetta app today and it was very good."}
{"text":"Five stars for customer service! I was one of those people trying to use multiple coupons. I had one for a free dessert for my birthday and another for $5 off a to-go order. The manager kindly let me use both and wished me a happy birthday.   I always get the same thing: the schrieners sausage and caramelized onion pizza on thin crust and a chicken pine nut salad. SO GOOD. For dessert I tried the cannoli. That was not as good. I wish they still had their tiramisu. That was the best.  Oh and I got a side of Mac and cheese because how can you not. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Shame on you Fox Concepts. This is a sad for me.  I usually don't even bother with writing a bad review. But this can't go unmentioned.  This is the second visit in a row that we have been unable to get our side order because the kitchen ran out.  Yet somehow when I go up to the counter to check and see why other people have the same side and I don't, I'm told. We are out and it will be up in a minute.  Yes I'm talking about the bread.  And the lack of awareness in the service once you've been served.  Disappointed. RL"}
{"text":"I love Sauce! Sauce is one of the only restaurants my WHOLE family can go and find something they love! I always get the quinoa beet and arugula salad or the roasted vegetable salad! My dad enjoys the meatball panini and the sausage caramelized onions pizza. My sisters love the bruschetta and mac and cheese! My family from out of towns first stop for food is always at Sauce! Thank you to the kind woman manager with brown hair, you are always so kind and helpful to my family and I! The employees are sweet and the food is great every. Single. Time!"}
{"text":"Great timing for lunch on the patio! The cashier was great and engaging as I placed my order, being it was my first time.  Again, we sat on the patio and the weather couldn't have been more prime. Food came quick, had a custom hand tossed pizza and it was soooo good....not to saucey or cheesy! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible, the waitress was in a bad mood and there were no utensils on the table. We had to go and look for utensils on other tables, really?"}
{"text":"I go here whenever I can and they have always been  consistent. I went on 5/23/17 around 7pm and ordered a Caesar salad with no chicken and a pizza.   Pizza was great salad had huge leaves like they were never cut and it had chicken. This was the second time this happened to me here. I guess I won't be ordering the Caesar salad anymore."}
{"text":"What a great pizza place.   They offer salads, pasta and pizza.  My husband had the pepperoni pizza and I had the green fields salad.  They put the dressing on the salad when I requested on the side but it was lightly doused and so was fine.  One thing that stopped me from ordering pizza, no pineapple or light sauce.  The pepperoni pizza was very good.  Will Return."}
{"text":"I love the North Scottsdale Road, Sauce location. I work at Shane Co. Right across the street and not having a car for a while limits your lunch choices. One day I was craving grilled cheese and tomato soup so one of my co-workers suggested Sauce. My life was officially changed! I love eating here! The food is always delicious and the atmosphere is awesome. Whenever I walk in, no matter how busy, all of the employees have a smile on their face and welcome me in like I am family. Keep up the great job guys!"}
{"text":"GREAT food and fast delivery. Highly recommend the chicken Cesar pizza. Yum yum yum!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are salad eaters, so I can only comment on this and not their pizza. We went for lunch today and ordered a vegetable salad and a gorgonzola & pine nuts salad which we altered a bit for my husband's taste. Both were really fresh and yummy, although not huge. Our bill came out to $17 which isn't too bad. We will definitely frequent this Sauce again."}
{"text":"A yummy-in my tummy cozy spot! I met a friend for lunch here and was pleasantly surprised. The food is full of flavor and very reasonable. They give you huge portions, and the service is very friendly. I got a salad and the caprese bruchetta. What a perfect combo! The bold garlic taste of the bruschetta, washed down by a light salad. My salad had the perfect amount of dressing. I wish we had this place in So Cal, I would definitely come more often!"}
{"text":"I really like their food, but this review is based on service. Twice within the last 6 months a tip has mysteriously been added to my bill. What's going on here? Sticky fingers? Sorry, but you don't get a tip for taking my order at the cash register. If I receive decent service at the table, I'll leave a tip. If you frequent this location, watch your credit card statements! The first time this happened, the manager refunded the tip. I have to call again and ask for a refund. What a hassle. Guess I need to pay in cash or stop going there."}
{"text":"I went to Sauce Pizza and Wine a week ago and it was very busy but all the sweet hostesses were calm and went through the line as fast as they could. They had extreme patience with all the costumers and gave us all extra bread rolls for waiting so long ! Food was amazing and employees were also amazing, keep up the good work !!"}
{"text":"I get the spinach and chicken salad here about once a week. It is very good and if I don't add a ton of dressing it is also pretty healthy! Additionally, it is a large enough portion that I am able to save some for later.  At about $9 it's somewhat expensive for a salad and a drink but the healthier options usually are."}
{"text":"Sauce is probably my favorite 'fast casual' place in Phoenix and honestly the world.  I love it.    The service is what one would reasonably expect from a place where one orders from the counter, fills a drink on one's own, and sits to eat.  There aren't unnecessary frills, that annoying bro who comes by and asks if everything is okay, and the place doesn't get super loud.   I like most of their pizzas but you can always hook me with 'caramelized onions' so that pizza with the sausage has been a favorite of mine for years.  I also like salad with chicken and walnuts; I normally share that with my friend Vicki when we go.  I've had their pasta dishes and other pizzas as well, I've never had something there I didn't like.  I've never had a bad experience.    Sauce routinely has specials to draw you in or give you an excuse to treat yourself to something nice.  I don't need an excuse to go but I do need to be in town.  This is one of the places I miss the most since moving from Phoenix.  I visit often, this is always a stop."}
{"text":"I really liked the caprese bruschetta. I have eaten at the Camelback location which has a full Western wall of glass, so in the afternoon  you have to sit in the sun!, get some blinds! The Happy Valley Rd location was fine, very busy. The pizzas are ok, definitely not the best I have had!! We ordered the chicken broccoli mac and cheese, they do not have alfredo, it tasted to much like kiddie mac and cheese to me! The only pasta is the round thick pasta or rotini.  It is close to home so I may go back for bruschetta."}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot while I'm working. I usually order through Postmates, but occasionally I'll walk in for take out. I love their roasted vegetable salad and their fontina basil pizza! The salad is so flavorful that I don't need to add the dressing that comes with it. The pizza is yummy too! I sometimes order the chicken and pine nut salad, which I really enjoy. It gets busy during lunch, but even if I call in to place my order it's never more than a 10 min for it to be ready. Friendly staff and quick! The prices are great too :)"}
{"text":"this place is GREAT!  We love to try new places and this has become a great staple for us!  Nice, quick gourmet inspired salads, pizza ( the good upscale one!) and panini's- their grown up mac and cheese is awesome too- we LOVE their soups! The wait staff is wonderful and the inside is newer and with designer paint on the walls.  Awesome wines  and tiramisu.  You will like it!"}
{"text":"Never again will I step foot into Sauce. I ordered my sausage and caramelized onion pizza to-go and they ask if I would like regular crust or thin crust. I politely ask for regular crust and the guy tells me that they only do thin crust.....um okay then why ask me if it only comes one certain way?? When I pick up the pizza it is the most pathetic looking pizza I have ever seen. I go back to yell and look at their pizza. None of which looked anything what I order. Don't waste your money on this crap."}
{"text":"This place is run by a very polite and professional team. The food is fresh and delicious and the atmosphere is very clean and inviting. The manager Cameron at this location is a reflection of how customer service should be. When door dash messed up, even though it wasn't his fault, he exceeded my expectations and went above and beyond to make sure everything was good. I can't say enough good things about Sauce on Scottsdale road. The good rocks and the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"WHERE'S THE SAUCE ?? PIZZA was dry n cold.  lackluster on the ingredients I should of just should just walk to blaze. Cookie desert was tardy like 20 min. Oh well first n last ."}
{"text":"I love Sauce but this location has some of the most frustrating customer service I've ever seen. I called in a pick up order and was told I would be put on a brief hold. The \"brief hold\" ended up being over 6 minutes. Not sure why I didn't just hang up but I was really craving some Mac and cheese this night! When I got to the restaurant the line to order was out the door. They had two employees taking orders and doing to go orders while about 4 employees just stood around talking. I will probably drive a little farther to go to another location with better service next time."}
{"text":"I like this place.  When I visit my pizza loving friend in Scottsdale - we head to Sauce - a super casual place in the midst of great shopping.  This is a \"no frills, order at the counter, they deliver the goods to your table\" type of place. The few times i've been there, the service was great for what I expect from such establishments. The atmosphere has an airy feel with a nod to some mod decor.  I usually share a salad (which comes with bread) and the prosciutto and melon pizza. It's delicious!!! ( I love prosciutto and melon - but on pizza!? ...YUM!!) I Also enjoy the tried and true classics they offer in their pizza selection menu."}
{"text":"So far I've ate here 3 times. The first was an okay experience with the staff and I had the chicken pesto pizza which was alright, but kinda dry. The second time was take out and the experience with the staff was slow and unconcerned. The third time was the worst and last time I will be eating here. I dined in and had the turkey and avocado salad with no tomatoes (personal preference, no allergy). My sister was with me and ordered the same. It took 30 mins for her food to come out and it ended up having tomatoes on the salad. No silverware was provided and when we asked for it, it took quite some time to be provided. My food however took 45 mins to come out and didn't have tomatoes but it also didn't have Avocado - which is part of the name of the salad. I only had an hour lunch since it was during work hours and ended up asking them to box it to go and adding avocado. The staff didn't seem to care that the food took way longer than it should have and the guy who boxed my food seemed put out that I requested avocado to be added when boxed. Needless to say, I won't be eating here for a while, or ever again if I don't have to!"}
{"text":"While I have to continue supporting the Sauce by my place, this brand new one right across from AJ's is very nice.  I am sure their spacious patio will be very popular.  The cashier was very friendly.  My food took a little longer than I expected, but to be fair I usually get a panini.  I did appreciate the cashier boxing everything up nicely and asking if I needed napkins and such.  Unfortunately, my \"spicy chicken sausage\" pizza, which I thought would just have crumbled chicken sausage on it, was blanketed with jalapeños.  I longsufferingly picked off every one of the little green peppers.  After my pizza was properly picked over, it was fine.  Good temperature, nice crust (I got the hand-tossed), decent cheese.  It's not Federal Pizza level but it's very solid, especially as a quicker, cheaper (around $10) to-go option.  My slice of cheesecake was quite good, and a nice medium size...not huge (Cheesecake Factory) but more than a tiny sliver.  I had no problem with parking in the evening.  Other than a rude car picking someone up and blocking the way...please park if you're picking someone up and there are cars behind you!"}
{"text":"Joined my friends for lunch here at their suggestion. Pleasantly surprised. The menu is very interesting and my salad was terrific.  The restaurant is very clean with a crisp décor with plenty of seating. The staff was very friendly, upbeat  and courteous. I will be back with my entire family next time!"}
{"text":"They ran out of gluten free pasta and didn't tell me until a few minutes after we ordered and my friends already started eating. But the the manager gal apologized and both gave me my money back and made me a gluten free pizza instead. Awesome customer service, will return."}
{"text":"I love this place. My wife introduced me to Sauce a couple of months ago and we go to lunch together here every now and then. I tupically order the chicken, broccoli pasta with cheese sauce and an artichoke and mushroom bruchetta. I love the food and the atmosphere is calm and relaxing as well. The staff os super friendly and the guy who usually takes our order at the front is awesome. Today, he brougjt our plates out and evem though it's self-serve, he asked if he could refill my glass of iced tea. I still don't know what's better, the food or the customer service. No matter... I highly recommend Sauce for inexpensive, delicious Italian eats and fast, courteous and friendly service."}
{"text":"Been here many times over the past 5 years. I mostly stick to the Chicken Caesar Salad but it is always consistently good. I find myself calling in to place a take-out order because just showing up can sometimes lead to a 10+ minute wait. Would definitely recommend the Caesar Salad Pizza if you're in the mood for something unique."}
{"text":"My wife and grandkids went to Sauce 10 9 09 we had the sausage pizza the creamy hot tomatoe soup plus three pastas. The food Is incredible big portions and a great price, not to mention are server was awesome."}
{"text":"Best mac and cheese in town!  A little pricey....but its always worth treating yourself every once in a while, right!?"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza we usually order the mushroom and truffled arugula pizza with a salad. Its the perfect amount of food for two people. The crust is amazing cracker thin crispy goodness. The also have gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"This place is good (remember, 3 stars is good), but I can't compare it to some of the upper echelon pizza places I have visited (see my great pizzas list).  The crust is a nice cracker crispy crust tastes even healthy with a light amount of cheese and nice tangy red sauce (on the red pizzas).  We tried two different Zas (one red with sausage and peppers which I really liked, and one white Mushroom and Arugula which my friendsthe mushroom lovers enjoyed).  We really enjoyed the Turkey and Feta salad. NOTE:  They have a a great summer $20 deal for 1 pizza 1 salad and 2 wines. This alone is worth the trip.  It would be nice if they had a better craft beer selection including drafts."}
{"text":"Not bad for fast casual Italian.  A step above the likes of Fazoli's and Pizza Hut.  Their pizza is thin and light, so you won't feel the \"ball of grease\" effect that you can get after richer pizza.  On the downside, they're also a little light with the sauce and cheese, as the crust cannot take as much as a pan or Sicilian crust.  The flatbread sandwiches are decent and good for lunch or a lighter meal.  The turkey, salami/ham, and meatball are all a step above Paradise Bakery's glorified \"cracker\" flatbread and Subway's lackluster options.  I'm not a big fan of the pasta, but my family likes it.  The lasagna wasn't spectacular, but was a solid 3.5/5.  The potato chips used to have a lovely Parmesan garlic garnish, which was eliminated.  Now they just grab chips from what looked like the same Sea Salt flavor of Cape Cod chips Costco sells.  I've also had them forget to pack my chips once.  I did not care for the Nutella trifle (not a fan of the slippery banana slices), but their cheesecake is nice, and their cookies are excellent with tons of white and milk chocolate chips and obviously lots of butter in the dough.  Call-ahead orders make takeout lunch orders pretty easy.  Gotta love convenient parking too!"}
{"text":"Sauce is our go-to place for quick pizza, salads and pasta.  We take out often as well.  A few weeks ago, my daughter placed a large take-out order, and didn't realize that three entrees had been left out until she got home.  She called and was assured that if she gave her name next time, she had three entrees coming.   I was in to place a take-out order last night, again, a few weeks later, and mentioned her name.  As soon as I said her name, the manager clearly recognized it, apologized again for the mistake last time, and happily took the charge off my bill.  Really well done.   Also - my opinion - best gluten-free crust in the valley."}
{"text":"I ordered Sauce last night to go and I am so Impressed by the service this location offers. The cashier as well as manager were amazing!!! They really know what customer service is.. Also the gluten free noodles option is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"You can always count on Sauce for good food! Never has disappointed with the food! However, be careful in ordering and make SURE you are precise and they read it back to you. Teens taking orders. Enough said on that part. Trying the Chicken Pine Nut salad!!"}
{"text":"Going downhill very fast, after the restaurant was sold to a new owner. I ordered food to go and they waited until I got there and already paid for my food to tell me that they no longer had what I ordered.. Strange considering they waited until after I had paid. So they did not give me my money back, which they should have, and told me I could order anything on the menu, I then ordered two things they did have considering it was their screw up. They then had the audacity to ask me to pay for the extra amount it would cost. I refused and the manager tried to argue but then realized he was wrong. They should have comped the entire thing to begin with. Once I had to wait an extra 30 minutes for them to then make the food I ordered. I got the food home and it was gross. I threw away more than half of it. Definitely not up to the standards I am used to. The quality of food has definitely gone down since it was sold. Not sure if I will be returning."}
{"text":"This is a perky, grab n go kind of place for Italian food.  I liked the huge, chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"First time going to Sauce....not awful but not what's expected. I was told it was a good date night place. Definitely not! At least not this location. Ok not a big deal. We got bruscetta, which was really good. The chopped salad, which wasn't that great. Lettuce was soggy, too much cheese. Also we got a couple pizzas. One regulator crust and one thin crust. I love thin crust pizza and this was probably the worst one I've ever had. Paper thin, soggy and burnt black edges. So all in all, i know not to go back for salads or pizza but i would go back and try something else since they have decent prices...."}
{"text":"Since a lot of the Fox RC eateries are Phoenix exclusives we are sure to bring visiting friends and family to at least one spot - usually Culinary Dropout for the touristy scenery - but we recently found Sauce and have already gone back twice in three weeks. Sure you can get pizza anywhere but Sauce has that amazingly trendy feel and some unique combinations worth trying.  Our first experience at Sauce had us sampling their grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup as well as their meat lasagna. Both traditional items but done exceptionally well here at Sauce. In addition, we got to try the potato and rosemary pizza - so interesting! My second stop at Sauce allowed me to try the proscuitto and melon pizza - another interesting combo! I love proscuitto and melon in general and now I can say that I enjoy it as toppings on my pizza. What makes the creative combinations work so well is the thin and crispy crust.   While it's not going to be the only place we go to for a pizza fix (especially if we're craving a greasy fulfilling pizza) but it'll be on our list when we're in the mood for a casual and fresh meal.   We have been to both this location as well as the one in Scottsdale Fashion Square. Both were busy on a Friday night but service doesn't take long. With decent \"going out\" prices and a \"order at the counter\" system, It is the perfect place for a casual dinner with friends."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Sauce.  I didn't realize you had to order at the counter and then they brought it out to you...which is OK just unexpected.   My friend and I split the cucumber salad and a pepperoni pizza...ULTRA thin pepperoni pizza.  Both were awesome.  I could have totally eaten the whole pizza myself though and will when I go back."}
{"text":"Sauce has been one of my go to spots for years. They have a variety of fresh and healthy meal options. The restaurant is clean and beautiful to dine in at. The service is fairly fast for when I need to get my meal to go.   You can't go wrong with any of the food here.   Don't forget to to use the check in offer for 10% off!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place. We still like it, but it has changed since Fox sold the brand. The quality of the food has decreased and the service has suffered as well.   Tonight, my wife got a chicken, spinach, and apple salad. The chicken that was on the salad were parts that should have been trimmed off the good chicken and discarded.   We also waited 20 minutes for our pizza. We had to ask for forks (there weren't any in the in the red can where they're supposed to be). Lastly, the whole vibe of the place has changed. It seems like teenagers are running the place."}
{"text":"My fiance and I stopped by Sauce to enjoy their current \"2 for 20\" summer special, which includes a salad of choice, pizza of choice, and wine for $20. Overall, it is a pretty great deal.  We ordered the Chicken, Spinach, and Apple salad with the Lasagna pizza. We also substituted wine for soft drinks, which Sauce was fine with. The salad came out with plenty of chicken and tasted delicious. The brick oven cooked pizza came out a few minutes later. The pizza was high quality overall, and the taste was on par with some of the better pizza places I've eaten at in the past.  I'm only giving Sauce a 3 star review for 2 reasons: Subtracting 1 star for lack of discount applied for checking into Yelp. On the Yelp page for Sauce it says \"Check in for 10% off any bill over $10.\" The manager says that 10% off is not applicable to the 2 for 20 deal, even though on Yelp there are no stipulations and on the in store advertisement there are no conditions on the 2 for 20, except that it expires Aug 31. Subtracting a second star for pizza cut. The pizza was poorly cut, and slices had to be fully cut with a knife at the table.  Recommendations to management: Don't contradict your advertising. You got us in the door with the 2 for 20 deal and we were even more excited about the 10% off on Yelp. Unfortunately, we felt a little cheated, which doesn't really breed repeat customers, regardless of how good the food is."}
{"text":"Service was good. pizza toppings and sauce was good. but the crust, well it tasted like a piece of charcoal. Manager even offered to refund the pizza money when he saw how much \"burnt flour\" was on the bottom of all 3 of our pizzas. When theres enough to bleed black on your plate its to much. Next time i'll ask them to sweep the brick oven first. Charcoal does not taste good."}
{"text":"Went to Sauce Friday night.  We have been here previously and this is one of our fave spots. We ordered two pepperoni pizzas and a Caesar salad and a chicken pine nuts salad.  The thin crust pizza really hit the spot. Not to overwhelming and doesn't make you feel like there is a brick in your stomach after eating it. The salads are super fresh and crisp. We also love the bread rolls they give complimentary. Overall, this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"The food is great, the prices are up there. It's always freezing cold in the restaurant so if you're not doing takeout bring your sweater. Definitely get the side of Mac and Cheese, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I went today with my mother and boyfriend. They had great customer service, all the employees were attentive and very nice.  We weren't very impressed with the food. It was OK, but nothing really was very tasty. Just good."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Staff wasn't helpful. Bathroom was disgusting. Food was unsatisfying and there was absolutely nothing special about it. And the food poisoning later that evening was not enjoyable either. Especially being pregnant. Definitely will never, ever go back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for salads; they're all good, but my favorite is the Quinoa, Beet, & Arugula.  Their sandwiches are also delish and the perfect accompaniment to the salads.  Great selection of herbal & caffeinated teas. Have yet to try the pizza or pasta, looking forward to it.  The Camelback location is spacious & clean and has indoor & outdoor seating.  Service is fast and pleasant, prices are reasonable, food is scrumptious.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Had the wild, mushroom with truffle oil...added prosciutto. Place was pretty much packed and the service was friendly and on point!"}
{"text":"Quick service!  The pizza and salads are so fresh and gluten free. You can definitely taste the difference! Delish!"}
{"text":"Chicken pesto pizza was delicious (keep in mind this pizza does not have marinara just pesto) Their artichoke & mushroom pizza with mozzarella and marinara was very cheesy... Just the way I like it! Caesar salad was good too and they add big thinly sliced Parmesan."}
{"text":"The service here continues to get slower and slower. 20 min for a panini, only 3 customers. Seems only to happen when the boss is gone."}
{"text":"Usually have good experiences here and the food is great but the customer service and training of their staff is horrible. Went here for lunch on my lunch break. Ordered a pasta red sauce at 12:05 and found a table outside to wait since inside was full. 12:20 rolls around and I still don't have my food. I go inside and the staff automatically knows what I had ordered and the blonde manager said they didn't bring me my food because they couldn't find me. I asked \"so you don't look at the tables you have available outside when the inside is clearly FULL\" she had no reply nor did she try to apologize for the inconvenience at all. Wasted a whole lunch hour to not even eat. Don't bother coming when their busy because they lack common sense like this."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I got a salad and cheese pizza. The crust was so thin. We also got a cookie topped with ice cream. This was the best I have had in all of Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Omg, gluten free, egg free pizza!!! It is such a treat to come here and be able to have pizza.  They also have amazing green salads. The crust and sauce flavor aren't quite to 5 star level...a bit too sweet and lacking in Italian spice goodnees, but definitely one of the better gf experiences I've had."}
{"text":"We came to Sauce for lunch on our way to a Diamondbacks game. It was my first time, and I had some pretty high hopes. I am a BIG fan of pizza, and with a name like Sauce, they must have good pizza.   Fired Pie opened a few months ago, and while the pizzas are smaller, and cheaper, they taste better. However, the range of toppings is impressive at Sauce. They also have pasta and an impressive wine and beer list.   Glad I got the chance to try it, but if I had to pick, I would pick Fired Pie over this place all day long. Good, but not great. Although, it does have a fun atmosphere. Makes me feel like I'm in Italy!"}
{"text":"I love sauce! Their food is just so yummy. I can't complain about anything. My favorite is the chicken ceasar salad"}
{"text":"I tried my first ever salad pizza and it was amazing! I got the Caesar salad pizza. It was crunchy bc of the super thin crust and the cheese on it was really good. The ingredients seemed really fresh.The price was okay and I like how their complimentary water was really good and didn't taste like tap water. This place is a good place to go with your girl friends for lunch. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband & I tried Sauce Pizza & Wine for the first time on a recent Friday night after recently moving to the area, and what a great place it turned out to be!! The nice young woman who took our order at the counter was incredibly patient & helpful as she explained the menu options, and we couldn't have been happier with our Margherita pizza (drizzled with balsamic - yum!) and the quinoa salad my husband talked me into was seriously the best salad I've ever eaten. The traditional pizza crust was just right - not too thick & not too thin, and you can tell they use nothing but quality ingredients. Trust me, we're going to be regulars at this place!"}
{"text":"I crave their caprese bruschetta night and day! Literally the best thing I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Chicken pine nut Gorgonzola salad is where it's at!!! Thats my go to. The macaroni and cheese is also really good. Well shoot they have a ton of things I enjoy!  The chicken Ceaser pizza (a pizza with a salad on top) is a healthier option and still delicious. You can actually add any salad on top of a of the crust.   The apple walnut and spinach salad is pretty tasty, as well as the tomato soup!  The paninis are all pretty great and come with a side of chips. They just added some brushetta to the menu that make great starters, and the cheesecake is an awesome dessert!   Ask for an extra roll... Oh man their bread rolls are some of the best I've ever tasted. Believe me you will want another.   This location has awesome service just wish there was a patio :)"}
{"text":"First time here and it's a great place and the food tastes great also. In town for a baseball tournament and kids wanted pizza. Waitress was happy and helpful, food came out fast and delicious.  Recommend this place and will be back"}
{"text":"My understanding is that of recent, Sauce is no longer a Fox Restaurant.  I'm not sure if it is coincidental or not, but it seems as though the food has gone downhill since that transition took place.  I always order the quinoa salad with salmon, and the past few times I've ordered it, the salmon is more like dry, crunchy salmon jerky instead of the tender salmon they used to serve.  My coworkers have made similar observations about their food since the transition - dry salmon, food is bland, pizza has less toppings.  I also have to agree with another reviewer's comment about the brown haired guy at the counter.  He is the worst!  I have been coming to this location 1-2 times per week for almost two years now, and I order the same exact salad to go.  Yet every time I walk up to the counter, he gives me the same blank stare like he has never seen me before, asks my name and what I would like, and says, \"For here?\"  You would think after interacting with someone 100+ times, one might memorize at least one of those details.  Anyway, I was willing to put up with him when my salad was tasty, but I may have to take Sauce off of my lunch list if the food does not improve."}
{"text":"We went to Sauce a couple of weeks ago before a visit to the dentist. We were looking for a place where we could get a quick and tasty lunch in the area and didn't want to pay for over priced sandwiches at AJ's. As we were driving around the Dana Park shopping center, we passed by Sauce and decided to check it out.   Ordering is easy at a cashier and the selections include gourmet pizzas, salads, sandwiches, bruschetta and freshly made soups. Service was friendly and our order of a veggie pizza and salad came to less than $20. We were checking out the decor and less than 10 minutes after we had ordered, our food was delivered to our table with a smile. The salad was great; lightly dressed and a good sized portion. The pizza was better than I expected. Super thin, wafer like crust and just enough toppings to not miss anything but not so much that you are full after one or two slices. The sauce was fresh and both the pizza and salad were more than enough to serve two for lunch. As we were finishing up, my boyfriend noticed that this was a Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurant. If you've been to a FRC place before, it makes sense. Well done, Sauce. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Quick service, large menu with options for everyone, great pizza - especially the hand stretched! Doesn't hurt that the wine is delicious and cheap."}
{"text":"Their sauce and dough is vegan. I got the artichoke and mushroom pizza (w/o cheese) and added spinach, so good!"}
{"text":"We ordered a watermelon salad and a customized pizza with a variety of vegetables, mozzarella cheese, and grilled chicken. The person who took our order read it back to us to make sure it was correct. It was correct. I preemptively gave a decent tip before our food came out.  Our server was very friendly and brought us our food. Everything was great, except the grilled chicken was missing from the pizza. I mentioned this to the server and he said he had to speak with the manager. After some time passed, we were hungry and started eating our chicken-less pizza. He asked if I wanted some grilled chicken on the side, but I asked for a refund instead. We waited for awhile, and was asked if we wanted a cookie instead. No I didn't want a cookie, so he gave me $1.50.  Well, I'll definitely come back because it was still tasty, but shouldn't a order be pretty easy to read especially when the main ingredient is grilled chicken? I'm sorry, but taking a food order shouldn't be like a game of telephone.  Addendum: I was contacted with an apology so I'm going to change the review from a 3 star to a 4 star."}
{"text":"Salads  are great. But it seems the profit margins have been boosted by shrinking the portions. Order for take away get far more. Order it for eating in and it shrinks.   The service is fantastic. They are not getting tips but kept on checking how we were. If they could top up out iced teas. Excellent service.   Ps. Actually maybe the portions are fine. Making them a little smaller worked perfectly. Great place"}
{"text":"I have ordered take-out thru the Internet a couple of times from Sauce.  Convenient as I live in the neighborhood.  Service always attentive, food always good.  Potato pizza surprisingly tasty."}
{"text":"What is there not to like about sauce.   Our favorites are the chicken Caesar pizza and the caprese salad.   Is a great option for either dine in or take out."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place. And I have a feeling I yet to take advantage of the full menu.  I typically order the caramelized onion & sausage.  Yum!  And when I'm in the mood for salads, it was the Caprese salad.  Nowadays, when I'm craving bread, I order the caprese bread with pesto sauce, mozzarella cheese, and vine tomatoes.  Mm. Mm. Good!  I don't dine in often. When I have, the atmosphere was cool but can get  loud when crowded.  I like how the servers come to my table to see if we need a to go box or refill.  When they are busy, the won't be doing that.  I've had my eye on trying their wines but hadn't done it yet.  I don't drink that often anyway so I rarely think about.  I do think it's cool that they offer this though.  I think if this place as \"new style\" pizza.  Maybe it's not new, but it's new to me.  When I want pizza but need a break from the Pizza Huts, Domino's, and Little Caesars, I go to Sauce.  And I am satisfied."}
{"text":"We used to love this place a few years ago, but the quality of the food has been deteriorating  to the point that we stopped going. We ended up trying it again today because the place we wanted to go to was packed and it was too hot to walk. The toppings on the flat bread that we used to love were microscopic. The avocado on our favorite salad was tiny as well.  There are much better options around, so I'm afraid today was our last visit."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my boyfriend my salad was delicious however he found not one but two hairs in his food. The servers should be wearing their hair up. The bread rolls were in the oven for the whole entire meal we didn't receive them with our food. We were tired of waiting so we just decided to leave. There was maybe four other parties dinning yet our food took 10 minutes for a salad and mac n cheese."}
{"text":"We were looking for a fun and inexpensive place to eat on the waterfront in Scottsdale and this is the one that made the cut.  I had never heard of Sauce before but we liked the idea of pizza/pasta and wine.   We gave it a shot for lunch and were not disappointed.   Sauce is very much like a Chipotle atmosphere, you walk in pick your item off a menu posted on the wall, order and then sit down the best part was the customer service!  You are normally expected to get up and get your food when its ready (in a low key environment like this) but they brought it to our table. We also received bread which was unexpected. The attention to detail that the team gave to us was very unexpected but much appreciated, even during their busy lunch hour.  The food options were creative, it gave you the opportunity to try something new. We tried the Rosemary Potato Spinach, Feta & Olive Tapenade Pizza and were not disappointed. We also got the Vegetable Salad with  (Carrot, Asparagus, Cucumber, Corn, Tomato, Parmesan & Avocado). It was a very generous portion, fresh and very good. We had planned to split it and it was just perfect to do so, it was definitely not a pathetic looking mini salad that you often find at a quick restaurant atmosphere.  We definitely enjoyed our time there and for a quick inexpensive bit to eat it hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Sauce = dinner on a Tuesday night; it is fast, affordable, and satisfying fare for a weekday. The tomato soup and Caesar salad are excellent. They are very generous with bread rolls, which are delicious! The lasagna is great if you're a beef eater. You have to recognize Sauce for what it is- fast pizzas, salads, and sandwiches in a casual dining atmosphere. If you're expecting gourmet or \"Bianco-esque\" pizza, you're at the wrong place."}
{"text":"I ordered one of their pastas. I came with two other people. Each of them ordered a different type of pasta than I did. All three of us felt pretty, \"eh\" at the end. Like it filled our stomachs but totally didnt hit the spot for anyone. I actually stopped eating halfway through my pasta because I looked up the calories. Now I disclaim that If it had been delicious, or even good, I would have probably kept eating. But I make better pasta out of a box at home and I wasnt about to eat a zillion calories and not even feel like it was worth it in the end. It was really bland, unimpressive, unidimensional, incredibly calorie dense for how tasteless it was, and if youre looking for a place to splurge on calories that are actually WORTH the splurge, this is not it."}
{"text":"Boy, I didn't want to go here. My wife loves sauce, but I was not a fan. I mean, there are just other places with better food. However, my Sunday night experience with my wife and in laws may have swayed my mind.  We were greeted by Charlie and a trainee. Like the majority of time, we didn't really know what to order. So what do we do? We pretend like we know what we want by delaying our response finally asking the recommendation of Charlie. Now Charlie was friggin' awesome. Very hospitable and gave strong recommendations. He talked about the Quinoa, Beet, & Arugola salad like it was the tastiest item on the salad menu. But wait, there's more. He said we should add salmon to it. Salmon? Oh you bet your bottom dolla salmon. Was it tasty? I would have to say that I would definitely order this again. Way to be awesome, Charlie!  The two pastas we ordered were the Pasta & Meatballs and Chicken, Broccoli & Cheese Sauce. The Meatballs were ok but I digged the shell pasta texture. Little of flavor but big and thick compared to regular noodles. Now to the chicken and broccoli. I was pretty disappointed. My wife said it is usually really good, but there was a clump of chicken piled up in one location. It would have been better if it were spread out. It was light but lacked the flavor I expected.  Now, I love my pizza. Growing up in Filipino culture and having a pallet for all kinds of flavors, I would have to say that pizza is my favorite food. I know, my wife thinks I'm weird too. We ordered the Wild Mushroom and Spicy Chicken Sausage. The wild mushroom was a little dry but the crust had a nice crunch to it. It was just ok. I did like the spicy chicken sausage. Subtle spice but great flavor from cheese. Would order that one again.  Overall, the restaurant looks great tucked in the middle of the Norterra area. Lots of seating inside and out. You order first, pay, then sit down. Reasonable prices if you're not looking to hurt the wallet. Am I a fan now? I will say Charlie gave excellent service so I have to highlight that. The food was ok but the 4 stars were based on service from the entire staff. As a result, to answer the question, I will definitely come back to enjoy great service and hoping a better experience with the food."}
{"text":"Go to Trader Joes, buy their fresh pizza dough, grab some of their pizza \"Sauce\" and select some toppings. Then, create and bake the pizza at home. Your end product will be worthy of 5 stars in addition to being cheaper and tastier than the pizza at Sauce.   This place is just mediocre. I've eaten homemade pizzas, frozen pizzas and food court pizzas that have tasted better. Leave it to the cunning Mr. Fox to create a seen and be seen, trendy, fast food pizza joint in disguise located in Scottsdale. Go figure.   I'm not saying Sauce is awful but it's definitely not a place that I want to go back to. The pizza (actually just the food in general) was disappointing. Especially the pizza, as the crust was more like a crispy, greasy cracker sprinkled with parmesan cheese.   There are two reasons why I gave Sauce three stars instead of two. Number one is because I really liked their Sangria. For $5 I got a huge glass that was very delicious and strong. Number 2 is that I really like the concept. Fast, cheap pizzas and salads are all great things! However, these things are not great when they just taste OK. The food at Sauce needs some improvement.   To sum it up - I don't recommend Sauce as there are much better chain type places near the \"waterfront\" in Scottsdale... but if you must go here it isn't horrible, it's just alright."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Just ordered my usual salad and soup and was handed a plastic cup for water. I have a thing about plastic so requested a glass and was told she would have to charge for it...charge for a freakin glass! How rude and petty.  There was a time when someone would promptly stop by the table and ask how everything is and when I finished, dishes were promptly picked up. Not a sole asked how my dinner was this evening and empty dishes have been sitting in front of me for at least 15 minutes. Looking at 6 employees on the floor and besides me, 3 people here. Needless to say, wont be back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I always visit the Norterra location and my office from the Thunderbird location. We were in old town for a staycation so we decided to get quick take out for dinner. We ordered from our hotel room which was a couple miles away and then looked for parking in the garage. I'm sure by this time it was a good 12 minutes from when we ordered. A family of 4 was 2 ahead of us when we entered, rather than walking up to take out register we just waited; now we are a good 15-17 mins in fromm ordering. Once we got to the register we paid and was told it would be a couple mins. Needless to say, the family of 4 was well into their meal of pizza, salad, Mac and cheese when I went back to the register to find out where our food was. No apology, not even a look of care. I eat Sauce 1-2 times a week, but I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"My daughter and I get take out once a week from here.. never 1 bad experience in a few dozen visits, until this past week. Tired and ready for the holidays we order when I pick her up which is 20 mins out; confirmed wait was 15-20 mins ...perfect! We get there, okay and was told we were waiting in the kids mac and cheese.  15 minutes later with a whiny, hungry and tired 5 year old they confirn my name and pull my daughters food off a shelf to the side. No apology from the manager that looked at us multiple times, only from the sweet host that helped us; we get home and her food is cold:("}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong... I LOVE sauce!!! But recently they completely changed their mac n cheese AND their crumbly sausage.... :( these are two things that made them DIFFERENT from other restaurants. I had two go-to orders I ALWAYS got when I went there and now... it's not the same so it isn't somewhere I would go to as much anymore. I hope it changes back :("}
{"text":"This place was really good. Only four stars because we got it delivered via Postmates and can't comment on anything about the restaurant itself. But the food was really flavorful. We had the pesto bruschetta, a pizza, the quinoa-beet-arugula salad, and some kids' noodles. Everything, including the dessert cookie, was devoured happily. Great food for sure."}
{"text":"First of all, don't confuse \"Sauce\" with all the new Pizza places popping up, like \"Pie Five,\" \"Pizza Me,\" and \"Fired Pie.\"  At \"Sauce,\" you still order at the counter, but you should plan on it taking a good 10-15 minutes for you to get your food, and also for it to be worth the wait.  The service here is great.  Everyone is very courteous, even when they're incredibly busy.  I've really enjoyed my food both times I've been there.  I had the Chicken Pesto Pizza, and while I wasn't a fan of the crust, the pizza as a whole was outstanding and very fresh.   I also tried the Salmon & Kale Salad.  Actually I ordered it with Chicken instead of Salmon at someone's recommendation, but they brought Salmon by mistake.  Still very good.  Overall, this is a great restaurant.  If you don't mind hanging out a bit, come in and sit down.  If you're in a rush, I would recommend ordering To-Go in advance.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service: 1 star.  Food: 3 stars.  I have eaten at sauce a few times. It is never my first choice, but I do have a couple friends that love this place. It's boring to me. Their pizza is mediocre.  The service however has been awful the last two times. The last time, I ordered takeout for a friend and I literally was standing there for 10 minutes before someone helped me. The employees looked like chickens running around with their heads cut off. They were only helping the dine-in customers. Several people looked me straight in the face and continued to ignore me. Finally someone asked \"have you been helped?\" I said no, and they proceeded to not help me for another 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Just don't get this place. The pizza is just above delivery quality! The salads are average at best. It should be in the food court at the mall! Sam Fox fools everybody again!"}
{"text":"Long line to door with only one order taker.   Ordered soup and panini..... Panini came and soup finally arrived five minutes later.   Roll that usually comes with soup was unavailable for another five minutes!  This place needs some supervision and coordination."}
{"text":"So the food at Sauce has never disappoint you me in the last 5 years that I've been coming here (different locations).  The Fennel and Sausage Pizza has been my recent fave - and it is UHH-MAZING!!!!  Tonight particularly grabbed by attention.  The staff here (mostly younger highschool-college kids) are all polite, friendly, and eager to help.  The crew here looks like they are enjoying working here and it shows!!!    Keep up the good work Sauce Thunderbird!  You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"they have such amazing food and service and they're gluten-free mac & cheese is delicious they work really well with people who have food allergies and are just great highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I am very particular about my pizza- I like it thin, I like it crispy, I don't like too much sauce, I like a tasty dough, etc. Sauce was awesome! At first I wasn't sure if I could eat a whole 12 inch by myself... well, I ate all of mine and one slice from my moms! I had the portobello and artichoke and it was so yummy! Cracker thin crispy crust, tasty, not oozing with sauce- perfect. My mom's chicken and broccoli was good and so was my sisters pepperoni and sausage. Side thing for me was that they had diet dr. pepper- one of my favorite drinks ever and most places do not have it from the fountain! This was our second restaurant in the Fox group and they are obviously doing something right! We will be back when we come visit again!"}
{"text":"Great service and nice ambiance, but the food doesn't hold up.   I started with the spinach, apple and Gorgonzola salad, which comes with chicken, and none of the flavors worked right. The nicest thing I could say about the salad was that the spinach wasn't wilty at all.   Next, we had ordered the four-cheese pasta which features broccoli and chicken, and it fell flat. The rich white sauce lacked flavor,and the broccoli looked good but tasted odd. The chicken was completely different from the chicken on the salad - in a good way, but it was still kind of odd.   I could see myself coming back here just for the convenience factor, but it won't be with any anticipation for good food, unfortunately."}
{"text":"The pizza at Sauce is the best!  I've had pizza in Italy (Rome, Tuscany, Umbria, etc) and love it there; I'm always disappointed by the pizza here in the US, and have only found a few places in the entire country that do what I consider to be a good crust; 'Sauce' manage to get it right! (the other fabulous place in the US is 'Pizza Antica' in Lafayette, CA).    I don't understand another reviewer complaining about the amount of meat in the pizza; pizza is not about piles of meat, it is about a combination of ingredients - a perfect balance.   The pastas and salads are also absolutely spot-on - every salad and pasta I've had has tasted fresh and has good ingredients. My only complaint about Sauce is that you can't sit outside and drink beer!  On a warm summer's evening, you must sit inside (in the over-cooled air) rather than sit at a table outside.  I know this is due to some local city rule, but still - has prevented me from going there more than once.    The pricing and service are also extremely good."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and delicious food! The price was perfect! My friend and I came to have an early dinner and they were super busy but the service was so quick as soon as we sat down after ordering they brought my salad out. The pizza took awhile since they have a wood brick oven but it was well worth the wait! This place is amazing but what really puts it over the rest is their awesome customer service. There was these twins working at the counter and on the floor that were so attentive and super nice! And I think the manager was the one who checked up on us and asked how things were going but this is place was awesome definitely going back"}
{"text":"Came here because their website says they have Daiya vegan cheese.. this location does not.  That's alright, I like a cheeseless pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner for pickup from here last night (11/30) and had a really good experience thanks to missy at the register (don't know her name). My guy and I thought about eating there, and we would've if it wasn't so busy... It was ok tho, we enjoyed dinner at home with our puppies.   Ordered soup, salad, pizza and Mac n' cheese. Total came out to be slightly over $25. What a steal! Apparently, Sauce has a special going on for the holiday season where you buy a $25 gift card and you'll get $5 for free! I LOVE FREE!!!! Missy at the register suggested we get the gift card to use towards our dinner and that way we'll get $5 for free. Had no idea that was going on if it wasn't for her, and we absolutely appreciate her taking really good care of us. She was very sweet, smiles a lot, and seems to really enjoy her job! She radiated a lot of good energy for being up since 4am.   I've been here many times and each visit has been very pleasant. Food is great, service is excellent EVERY SINGLE TIME! Thanks for always being on point. We love our neighborhood, and the restaurants on this side of town. Thank you for always taking such care of those that take care of you, Sauce!    P.S. I would really like to recommend the winter roasted vegetable salad, it's the bomb! Mac N' Cheese not my favorite. Other than that, Sauce is a great place to enjoy dinner and it's good on the wallet too!   Happy holidays!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sauce location of all on Central and Camelback. Eat here at least cpl times a week.  They're always on beat and never failed an order in or dine out, dishes and presentation always beat my expectation. I will drive out of my to go to this location anytime."}
{"text":"Imagine if all your dreams came true, layered together on one perfect pizza. That pizza would be one made at Sauce. I had the fig, prosciutto and goat cheese, my husband had the chicken pesto. The crust alone will rock your world. Crispy, crunchy, with just a little bit of chewy deliciousness in the center. Mine was topped with creamy goat cheese, sweet figs, salty prosciutto, and peppery arugula. The combination was heaven on a plate. The service was even better - on the day I was there, they were short-staffed so the manager was assisting- he delivered pizzas, bussed tables, and we even saw him washing dishes. Despite this, service was fast! Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"A 4 star pizza place in Phoenix?  About as common as swimming pools or sun tans, right??  Seriously, this is 4 stars for a couple of reasons.  *Food* Decent food.  Not incredibly innovative, but still more ambitious than the rest.   I especially like their sausage and caramelized onion pizza, or the pepperoni with crimini mushroom pizza.  Also, the wines by the glass are surprisingly well picked and easy on the wallet.  Make sure to try the spinach, pancetta and goat cheese salad.  It's really tasty.  I asked the staff what kind of dressing they used and they gave me a printed recipe.  Cool eh?  I am curious about the pasta and panini - haven't had them yet.  *Value* Can't be beat.  For what little you pay, you get the better end of the deal at Sauce.  For a while there, they were doing a $20 special for a 12 inch pizza, salad and two glasses of wine.   That, my friends is a steal, and why this place gets four stars.  P.S. I think this place can best be described as an atmosphere similar to Paradise Bakery or Pei Wei as someone said below."}
{"text":"Sauce is awesome!! I have been coming for years ever since they opened up. My favorite pizzas are the chicken Caesar and the sausage / Caramelized onions. The salads are great as well good place to come in with friends."}
{"text":"What truly shines at this location is the service! My husband and I dined here on a Saturday night, and the restauant was packed. When we placed our order, we were told that we would most likely have to dine on the patio (on a very cold night) because every table was taken, and that the wait on our food would be a minimum of twenty minutes. We were making our way to the door when the manager flagged us down and cleared a new table for us. Then, when our food came, he again apologized for the extended wait and offered us a dessert on them! We were very pleased with how this dining experience turned out from what could have been an unpleasant experience. And the pizza and mac n' cheese isn't bad, either."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 4 stars based solely on food.....BUT....the manager is extremely annoying. I get it Fox restaurants tend to train their staff to be friendly and they definitely have a script they are required to follow, but my last visit here with my son left a bitter taste in my mouth. The manager was standing at the head of the line talking to customers and directing them as to which side to go to....order in or take out. It was really busy (not a big deal to me btw because I love the food and it's worth it). What irked me was that he was telling the customers in front of me how someone complained about him (can't recall if it was on yelp or through the website?) and kept going ON and ON about it complaining that it had happened! To be honest I understood why. I've been here several times and felt he was annoying (sitting down with diners, talking and lingering too long, etc.) I'll still go to this sauce it's very convenient location wise for me, but they could use a revamp in management. Way too shmarmy for me and seems pretty arrogant."}
{"text":"The salads.... ahhh... Highly recommend the SALADS!"}
{"text":"Sauce is the best. I love the $20 deal for a pizza a salad and 2 glasses of wine. My husband and I just went there for dinner. It was quick and  yummy"}
{"text":"Sauce is well, Sauce. If you haven't been to one, it's worth checking out. Just don't get overly zealous about it.  Basic casual dining. Order at the counter, get a number, fill your drink, and head on over to sit at a table that's a tad too small and wait for your food (Which is generally not long at all! They are speedy!)  They do have beer and wine offered and specials at times for 2. (Pizza, salad, and wine for 20 bucks). The wine is always a little on the lukewarm side, but I ain't too proud to ice it down (though I would prefer not to, really).  The salads are spectacular. VERY fresh spinach and other ingredients. I would recommend these over anything else on the limited menu. The pasta dishes are also fresh, hot and seem quality. I'm not bagging on the pizza here, because it's fine. It's just not what I expect from Fox. It's never hot, always greasy and basically bland. I do have to give credit for them altering the dishes to make veggie friendly and never seem put off by doing so. The service is also consistently friendly and welcoming. Each time here a manager has checked on us. Plates are clean, silverware and glasses clean and tables clean. It's like Fox concepts meets a tiny, boring diner setting with no \"flair\".  If in the area, it's worth checking out if you are hungry. I really have nothing bad to say about Sauce. It just \"is\"."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pizza is fantastic, thin crust with fresh toppings. I also love the macaroni and cheese which is made with giant shell pasta. So good!"}
{"text":"Mmm...it was just ok.  It's a great alternative to the mall food court and good if you don't have time for a full fledged restaurant.  They only have one Pinot Grigio and it's a pretty crappy one.  I like that they chopped up the chicken in my salad (I hate when you get huge strips of chicken) and the salad was large but it didn't blow me away.  I would probably stop back in when shopping in the area because of how easy it was.   Convenience is all it really has going for it...the food is just ok."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  Between my family of 4 we have probably tried most of the menu items at Sauce.  My daughters (5 yrs and 3 yrs) love the pizza and pasta with meatballs.  I hope Sauce comes out with more specials like the Summer Deal - $20 for pizza, salad and wine.  My favorite items so far are the Meatball Sandwich and the Chicken and Broccoli and cheese sauce.  I need to find out where Sauce gets the side pepper that comes with the Meatball Sandwich.  If you like peppers ask for an extra one as the peppers are really good (not spicy but sweet).  Can you tell I am a HUGE fan of Sauce?  If someone knows where I can buy those peppers let me know?"}
{"text":"My wife doesn't but I like their thin crust pizzas"}
{"text":"We stopped in at Sauce this evening for dinner prior to some pre-Valentines Day shopping.  The restaurant was busy.  Despite this the staff was very friendly and efficient.  The food was delivered quickly and was of the same good quality as my previous visits despite being a busy evening.  The young lady who took our order first secured us a table and then took our order with a warm smile.  Bravo to the staff and management at Sauce.  Four stars for the restaurant and a bonus star for the great service."}
{"text":"Sauce is one of my absolute favorite places for pizza and wine! We usually get the crimini mushroom pizza and add caramelized onions. Mmmm! I also have had and absolutely LOVE the tomato soup (best I've ever had), the mac n cheese, the spaghetti and meatballs, the caprese salad (to die for) and the caesar salad (so perfect for lunch)! I've never had anything their that I don't love."}
{"text":"Okay, so being totally honest after trying this restaurant again, it kind of got worse. I remember this experience so vividly, so let me just tell you what I experienced last night.   So, we walk in and order our food. I ordered the pasta with red sauce and mozzarella (which honestly, in my opinion sounds completely appetizing) and was hoping that it would be good, so I could give Sauce another chance. It was far from that.  When I got the pasta, it literally looked like CANNED pasta with HORRIBLE red sauce, and sprinkles of mozzarella in each corner, that was completely lukewarm.  I wanted to like Sauce, I really wanted to. But sadly--I just didn't."}
{"text":"I love this place, I come to this location about once a month and I love it! It's priced great and has a great atmosphere to just hang out at. I went there yesterday and my bread roll was very hard which is REALLY unusual, so I asked to get another one. I wasn't trying to make a big deal out of it or anything but the kitchen manager baked all new rolls and brought them to my friend and I and was EXTREMELY apologetic which wasn't necessary but greatly appreciated. He also mentioned that he threw away the entire previous batch, they really go out of their way to make you happy there. I'll be coming back for years to come."}
{"text":"I've lived in this neighborhood for more than 35 years and I never knew this business was here until I received a Christmas gift card from a friend. Today was the day to try Sauce. The first thing I did was Google to find the address.  It's located in a strip-mall that's next to Safeway (where I shop 2 or 3 times a week) and I never knew it. The reason: The signage outside is AWFUL. I finally found \"The Sauce\" after travelling through the busy parking lot 3 times. I understand wanting to be \"fun\" and \"creative\" and \"progressive\" but when your sign can't be read from the parking lot, let alone the street, I fear customers might pass you by. It was lunch time, on a Saturday, and there were only 6 customers in the place. We ordered half portions (thank you for offering that option) and it was plenty of food. The tomato basil soup was amazing, and I highly recommend it. The house salad was great, too, with lots of different lettuce, tomatoes and other fun things. We enjoyed the pasta with meatball, and let me tell you, it was worth every cent! The rolls were great (nice and warm) and they offered one with each serving. I was pleased to be served on real plates and the portions were a perfect size. They bus the tables, too. I recommend The Sauce if you can find it!"}
{"text":"So Sauce used to be one of our favorite restaurants.  I mean we ate there like 3 times a month on average...  probably more.  Yet something has changed!    What used to be reasonable portions and appropriate pricing, has become skimpy portions (at best) and I presume the same pricing.  I'm not a particularly price conscious or a frugal diner... so I really can't tell you what they've done with prices, but I know what they've done with portions.    Last time my we got carry out, I actually thought my wife ate half of my chopped veggie salad on the way home!  When we talked to the manager about it (who was gracious, fantastic and well trained in the biz) they told my wife that the portions were \"pre-measured\".   O.K. I get that...    HOWEVER, what that translates into is 1) \"plan a trip to McDonald's\" after Sauce (which in our case is often before a Movie) 2) eat across the intersection @ Pita Jungle 3) plan to fill up on Popcorn or 4) don't go there if you are hungry.    We need more good restaurants in the North Valley, not less.    I want my old Sauce back."}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical about the idea of fast-casual Italian food but, actually this place rocks!   Great place to take the family before or after a movie.   Options include glutten free pizza & pasta.   So far, everything we have tried has been fresh and delicious! (pizza, pasta, sandwiches, salad)  They even have a good \"mini\" wine selection which is a bonus for the wife and I.  The line might be long, but give it a shot and you might have a new favorite."}
{"text":"This place is great. Pizza is awesome !!! Cookies are made here fresh and was baked to order. Setting is causal and welcoming. Service is great. I also tried Scottsdale location and it was same experience. Love it. Wish they would have some locations in Los Angeles.  Will be my \"must go to\" joint in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love fired pizzas, this one has perfect amount of sauce and cheese. I placed my order online and was done by the time I got there. My only complaint is it has a little too much flour on the bottom and dried my mouth out, no biggie though. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday at about 5:30 p.m. Tables were incredibly dirty, with food crumbs and stickiness. Surprisingly, two employees were periodically walking about picking up dishes--but they never cleaned tables or chairs until another patron refused to sit down until her table was cleaned. The food arrived fairly quickly, but the salad needed way more dressing and more salt, and my pasta with red sauce was practically naked. It was barely pink it had so little sauce (ironic, huh?). I asked for a side of sauce, but I found it bland and underseasoned. The children I was with ate their food, but I didn't taste it so I can't comment on theirs. Overall, I was vastly underwhelmed.  :("}
{"text":"Their pizza is pretty good. Another thing you ought to try, though, is their chicken caesar salad! Never met an employee here who was anything less than friendly, either. It's a bit pricey, but them's the shakes!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. I got take out and was really excited to eat the whole pizza but opened the box to find a cold pizza what tasted like a chip it was so stale. The crust literally crumbled down into crumbs. Ruined my day cause I saved all my calories for this pizza and now I have none left and am still hungry so thank you for that Sauce"}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time. Great food and excellent service. Well run location."}
{"text":"We went in as a group of 5, ordered together and had the same table number. We waited close to 30 minutes for the first person's meal to come out. It had been at least 30 minutes between the first plate coming to the table to the last. My wife finally had to cancel her order for her salad because it was taking so long. One person ate at a time and nobody could even eat together because of the time it took each plate to arrive at the table. We were very hungry while waiting for our food, and all of the rolls were \"in the oven.\" About 25 minutes of waiting for rolls, they finally came and were COLD. Also, we attempted to order the chicken pasta and chicken caesar salad and they were out of chicken. The entire experience was a huge let down. Seems like it is very poorly run, considering the last couple times we have gone have been like this. I guess we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really good thin crust pizza and Italian salad.  Gentleman at the counter was extremely friendly and even gave my son a cookie!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. We love the Sauce by Scottsdale Fashion Mall. We thought this would be the same experience. Wrong. We sat at a small table for two and had a very uncomfortable dining experience... one salad and both entrees came out first. We waited for the other salad while the three plates sat there. The other salad finally came out and we could barely navigate our table with all of the plates. We ate the salads while the our entrees got cold. A manager stopped by and asked how the food was.... we asked if it is normal for salads and entrees to come out together. He told us \"usually.\" We expressed our disappointment and he didn't care. We said \"we won't be back.\" His answer was a very sarcastic \"ok.\" For a $50 fast casual meal we could've gone to a much nicer restaurant and been treated like grown ups, as opposed to annoying children. Definitely will not go back!"}
{"text":"I went to Sauce for the first time last night. I had the apple and walnut spinach chicken salad and the pepperoni and sausage pizza.  Both were made to perfection and reasonably priced. The atmoshphere was warm and inviting and they had the monday night football game on. I will definitely come back and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"One of my \"go-to\" spots in old town for quick food. Sauce always has a hip crowd. The place is great and clean. The pastas/ salads/ soups/ and pizzas are all tasty. I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Sauce is a great restaurant.  I grew up in Arizona but moved to California a few years ago and unfortunately Sauce doesn't have any locations in California. So every time I'm back in town I try and make a visit to Sauce they have great pizza and salads. They're similar to California Pizza Kitchen but I definitely think they're superior quality. My two favorite items on their menu is the chicken Caesar Pizza and the sausage and caramelized onions pizza. I only wish they'd build a location in California!"}
{"text":"Generally I come here after a mall visit for cheap accessible food with a cute atmosphere. Today however was unacceptable. I ordered a turkey feta salad to go and had to come back because my turkey was not included. Once I started eating I found short hair in the bottom of my salad I can only assume was from the male cook.   Due to the location and the great service I know there will be many more years to come for sauce on camelback. I only ask for improvements in the kitchen area and competence."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, salad, pasta, and Panini. Basically everything is good. Food comes fast and service is good. I always grab and go because the restaurant is like a dorm dining hall.   Save room for a fresh chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"While most people probably visit Sauce for one of the delicious thin crust pizzas or well-portioned flavorful salads, I go out of my way to visit for the mac n cheese!!! No joke, this stuff is amazing! Creamy, cheesy and perfectly complimented with the side of bread that comes along. Give it a try and I'm sure you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Priced right with excellent product!  The caprese salad was amazing!!! great flavor!   It's worth the visit."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Sauce dozens of times over the years.   The service has always been great.  But in the last few months, the food, service and overall management has been horrible.  Not sure what caused the wheels to fall off.  But we have experienced the issues in 3 of their locations.  Too many other great places to go."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Always delicious pizza, salads and wine. Service has always been friendly and quick. I love their Wild Mushroom Pizza and their Watermelon Arugla Salad (seasonal). I especially love their summer special of 1 pizza, 1 salad and 2 glasses of wine for $22 -- a great date night!"}
{"text":"They have great food, the service was great! I got a pizza with meatball, and pepperoni and that was probably the best pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"Chicken broccoli pasta is good and the kid menu provided has enough choices to keep the little one happy and content"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and the food tasted great! I split the bruschetta, salad and pizza with a buddy of price and it was a good combo. Prices are very reasonable and I can say that I will come back again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good, fast, cheap pizza, this is the place.  Not a typical pizza joint.  Its the Noodles and Company of the pizza world.  Pick one of their main creations or make your own.  Pasta and salads as well.  Personally a much better bang-for-your-buck then CPK.  Great place to take the family in a pinch or whenever.  Recommended by friends last time they were in Scottsdale - and I can see why."}
{"text":"Either this place operates under the assumption that there's a national shortage on cheese or they hail from a part of Italy where pizza is actually flat bread. #NotCheesey #WheresTheCheese #CheeseMeBaby"}
{"text":"Consistent food, great quality, fast service. I can always rely on Sauce! My favorites: pepperoni pizza and the chicken, spinach and walnut salad. Clean, handicap accessible, lots of parking."}
{"text":"I am unfortunately writing with a horrendous review of youew of the food because I was not even able to eat due to the horrible greeting I was given by both the manager and district manager of your establishment.  Let me set the scene for you ... I was supposed to eat dinner with my two children, my parents and my brother and his wife.  They had all raved about how great Sauce was!  We arrived and my parents immediately got in line and I sat down with my two boys, ages three and five.  I figured by sitting down and occupying the children with toys they would be less likely to interrupt the other diners.  Right away a rather surly, un attractive manager got RIGHT in my face to tell me I was NOT allowed to sit down.  OK - she then went on to explain the \"rules\" of the restaurant - as she put it.  I totally understand trying to set up a restaurant - I worked in the restaurant industry for eight years - I have eaten !  ALL over the world - I get it!  What I do not get is being treated like I am at McDonald's and I am thirteen years old.  I then spoke with the district manager and she was just as rude.  All in all pretty disappointing because we left Sauce and went across the street to another establishment - now this morning I am sitting here craving pizza and I am going to have to go to Oreganos!  UNBELIEVABLE what poor service - twenty times worse than eating any where else in the valley.  Too bad for both you and I because North used to be one of my favorite places in the valley and now I am a little tainted in my view of Fox restaurants.  Well - I hope that manager goes back to working at Taco Bell and Sauce goes back to being an inviting place to eat."}
{"text":"The mood for some gourmet pizza led me here on my lunch..  And a couple good with bad happened. You can't just buy a pizza by the slice, they all come 12\"- which has a crispy and airy crust, but lacks in amount of ingredients. Could have used more toppings and tomato sauce. Particularly on my pepperoni and sausage pizza- $11.  My Vegetable salad was scrumptious though, plenty of dark greens, corn, cucumbers, and vinaigrette- $7. Juicy, and moderately proportioned. Only took them 10 minutes to get all the food out though. The cafeteria setting is not too appealing, considering the prices.. bill for just myself was $18.  Good- but overpriced! : /"}
{"text":"Went back and tried the pizza and salad, for sure worth it.  My wife and i split a mixed greens salad that is not on the menu.  It was really fresh and good.  We followed that with the Basil pizza.  It was really good.  Price is right and service is good."}
{"text":"The line was pretty long but not too bad. They only had one person taking orders. The food came really quick and I ordered gluten free pasta with their standard marinara. I'm celiac and wasn't too pleased to find a gluten regular noodle in my pasta. The marina was quite watery but overall some of the best gluten free pasta I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Hello the place is called sauce! The pizza is dry! Food is terrible. Right around the corner from my house. We were a group of 4 and we all hated the pizza. will never ever go  there again. Yuck. Don't waste your money. Wouldn't eat there if they gave me free food."}
{"text":"The pizza isn't great. I give it a 3 because it wasn't that expensive, but the middle of the crust was totally soggy and the outer crust was tasteless. Toppings on both our pizzas were mostly in the middle. The cannoli was sub-par, but only $2. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! They use quality ingredients and it really makes a difference. Their homemade Caesar dressing is to die for! The chicken Caesar salad pizza is one of my favorites! However, everything on their menu is great! I've yet to try their hand tossed crust but the thin crust is too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"There was no wait to order, but it took 4o minutes to get my pizza. For $11.25, I could have done better at Pizza hut or Domino's. It was a brick oven pizza, but the taste was not impressive, And the crust was not crispy at all. To top it off. I watched the box the pizza, then let it set 5 minutes before brining it to me."}
{"text":"I thought this place was a bore and a snore.  I was really excited when I heard about the quick-serve italian place.  I'm a big pasta person and I was hoping for some more creative options from Fox.  I got the chicken, broccoli, and cheese sauce and my friend got the mac and cheese or shall I say the Velvetta shells and cheese because thats exactly what both of our dishes tasted like only they added shredded chicken and broccoli to mine. I went a second time and got pizza.  Maybe its my fault for going to a place called \"Sauce\" but I didn't know they took the name so seriously and literally covered the pizza in sauce with no cheese.  I like pizza with lots of cheese and not so much the sauce.  Thats just me and I know its a preference and thats why they get 3 stars rather than 2."}
{"text":"Meh experience. I've gone twice. Once last year for the pizza and once more this past week for the salmon salad. Both were 2 star experiences. You'd think a place called Sauce would have excellent pizza sauce but it's rather bland. The salad was disappointing. The fish wasn't a fillet, it was chopped and served cold. It was either canned salmon or long frozen because it was very pale and flavorless. Well not totally flavorless, it did have that old fish aftertaste. I didn't get food poisoning which is a plus but I would never order it again. Service was fine no complaints."}
{"text":"Really good stuff. We used a delivery service called postmates since they didn't deliver.  Salad- chicken Caesar - spend the extra $2 for the chicken, so good.  Pizza - lasagna, so good  Meatballs which turned out to be meatball bread which was awesome.   Pizza and Ice cream... Yes please."}
{"text":"Oh my god! I have never had a better bruschetta in my LIFE! That is saying a lot since I am a carb monster and absolutely adore bruschetta! It is on a pillowy french bread slathered with homemade pesto, cubes of the freshest mozzerella I have ever had and topped with an aged (or it could be reduced) balsamic that has my mouth watering when I am parking my car! I can't say enough about this but make sure you try it and try the original only (the other one is not so good). This place could literrally only sell bruschetta and it would still get 5 stars from me. The service is fantastic and the wine/beer selection is good. I am not really a fan of their pizza or salads - the pizza is on a really thin crust and is just not spectacular and the salad tends to be drenched in dressing (which means if you skip it altogether you are probably saving enough calories to splurge on a bruschetta). Trust me when I say - get your own bruschetta - one bite in and you will regret the decision to share! At only $5 a pop you can afford it - and if you can't then skip the beer because its that worth it!  The parking is ample as this location of Sauce is located in a shopping strip mall. If you are reading this as you are leaving the state of Arizona, don't be depressed - there is a Sauce location at Phoenix airport so you can get your kicks in before departing the Valley of the Sun!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Not the Sauce it used to be. Received my mozzarella, fontina, and \"basil\" pizza and there was only basil on 3 slices of the pizza. The veggie salad used to be chopped and wasn't and had large shaved pieces of parmesan that comes across lazy verses generous. I've been back a few times since it changed over from a FOX restaurant and have been disappointed each time. There is definitely a difference. Can't help but notice it's not as busy as it used to be. I wish they didn't mess with such a good concept."}
{"text":"Every salad on the menu is A-MAZING!  The thin crust pizza is to die for!  I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Fast Food pizza is all the rage these days, but these guys seemed like they started the craze before it even officially started. Now, these kind of fancy small crust pizza places will never get more than three stars from a true NY guy, but we were hungry and it was time to at least sample the food here. It was a pretty basic pepperoni for about 9 bucks, nothing stood out and nothing will be remembered and likely no need to return. It was barely foldable and we went with the stretchable crust which at least is closer to NY pizza than that cracker crust Chicago crap that is all around the Valley. I would rather talk about the giant fresh baked cookie for just over a buck that I snagged at the end of the meal. This was chock full of every cookie add-on item that was invented and  was worth the price for sure. When you own 45 restaurants in eight states, there will be some average food served along the way, but those non-folders and pizza snobs might enjoy this style of pie."}
{"text":"I rarely go to Sauce because I have come to expect disappointment every time. In that regard, they meet expectations.  Every time I get take out the order is wrong. I usually order the Mac and cheese with extra cheese sauce.  Once I actually got NO cheese sauce on the mac and cheese at all.  Today it is so dry and lacking flavor of any sort. it's literally like eating dough. I just cannot return to this place again after today. Pass!"}
{"text":"Sauce is a decent, easy choice for quick lunch or dinner.   The food is OK - I found it better several years ago.  The ambiance is fresh and relaxed for a counter-order restaurant.  The menu has enough variety to make everyone happy: pizzas, pasta, salads, panini, gluten free, etc.  I like that you can order beer or wine with your meal (inside dining only).  Last week I tried their new, thicker crust and even though I'm a dough-lover I prefer the thin crust."}
{"text":"Initially I loved this place, but after going here regularly for work, the novelty wore off kind of quickly. The pizza's good, but doesn't compare to a lot of other places in the area. I know it says \"Pasta & Meatballs\", but I always think that's going to be spaghetti, and I'm thoroughly disappointed when it's not. I thought I'd try the \"chicken caesar & parmesan pizza\" to go out of curiosity. I don't know what I expected, but they gave me some pizza bread--Yep, a pizza but with nothing on it, and, completely separately, a chicken caesar salad. MAYBE I'm the crazy one and I expected too much, but I didn't expect to have to assemble my own food--especially something that is already IMPOSSIBLE to assemble. What the actual hell? I pretty much just stuck with the turkey and fontina panini from then on, but even then, it just got kinda boring. I wish I could love this place as much as I initially did, but now, in my mind, it's very mediocre."}
{"text":"I really don't know why this place doesn't have a 5-star rating. Every dish is freaking amazing on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"This is a place is pretty decent.  They have great staff, quick service and a pleasant atmosphere.   There are so many great gourmet pizzas and salads to choose from.      The different taste combinations are awesome and I love their prosciutto  and melon pizza.  10/10 for taste and 11/10 for presentation.   They serve beer and wine too!!!  A little pricey but a great place and plenty of food to eat."}
{"text":"I can always count on a great lunch here... the price is fair and the service is good. I wish they had more locations closer to my home. I love being able to order ahead for takeout on a busy work day."}
{"text":"Visited Sauce today for lunch with four co-workers.  It reminded me of an Italian Pei-Wei with the menu's on the wall and registers where you order then grab a seat and drink and wait for  your food to be delivered.  We ordered the bruchetta appetizer.  It was good but small.  The mozzarella cheese was good and soft but the tomatoes were of the no-flavor-steak type.  We had three pizzas, the best of which was the mushroom and arugula.  The crust is that Roman-kind  - thin and crispy.  I loved it but while the pizzas are good sized - 12\" they aren't very substantial and after finishing off a whole pizza myself I had a piece of the bruchetta and two more  pieces of pizza and still was filled.  On a five star scale, I give Sauce 3."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable place with staff oriented toward good service. We had good pizza and salads.  Wine beer selection a bit limited was only shortcoming.  We had chicken Parmesan pizza and Caesar Salads. Would be glad to come back next time in neighborhood"}
{"text":"Like the thin crust pizza, esp the spicy chicken sausage. Good pasta, spaghetti and meatballs. Love the meatballs.  Kid likes the mac n cheese. Can get a \"side\" dish of pasta at very reasonable price if not very hungry. Good bread also. Not a fan of their tiramisu though which I usually really like at other places. Good for takeout also."}
{"text":"We used to eat at Sauce regularly, but it has really gone downhill since leaving Fox Restaurant Concept. The salad ingredients just aren't to the same standard they used to be... often serving wilted greens and poor quality veggies. Today I ordered the GF pasta and red sauce in hopes of finding something better and it was over cooked to the point of starchy mush. Sad to see Sauce take such a dive."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place.  We go here a couple times a week.  I like the sausage and onion pizza and we also get a salad.  There are three salads I really like: feta and turkey, the apple one, and the caprese.  My husband and I share a pizza and a salad.  There is more than enough food for each of us and the food is pretty inexpensive.  Staff is friendly, although you order at a counter and someone brings out your food.  Aside from that you don't have much interaction with a waiter as you would at a traditional sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"I love that there's now gluten free pizza. Just had it again yesterday. The pepperoni and mushroom toppings were so good. I've had the turkey feta salad and that was amazing. The service is great and I'm always treated well. I'll give another star when they offer mute gluten free options."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Sauce, I had a sandwich, and I really liked it. I also really liked the retro decor of the place. It was different and seemed non-chain-like (whatever that means). The second time I went to Sauce, I had their pepperoni pizza, and it was, eh, okay. Nothing special...at...all. It was greasy and there was too much cheese for the thin crust to hold up so the slices were kinda limp when you picked them up. I've had better pizza from places like Ray's Pizza and Sardellas for a much more reasonable price.   The biggest problem I had with this second visit was that a few minutes after we sat down, they brought out my Mom's sandwich, but didn't bring out the pizza until probably 15 or 20 minutes later. H-E-L-L-O?! My Mom was already halfway done with her sandwich. We ordered them all together, so why didn't they bring the entire order out at the same time? That is a very bad way to serve food.  But, I do have to give them a little props because the manager came out with the pizza and apologized for it taking so long.    I think Sauce is pretty much overrated. The decor and look of the restaurant is kinda cool, but they need to work on their pizzas. I'll probably go back, but only for their sandwiches from now on."}
{"text":"Sauce is a great place to go if you're wanting tasty gourmet pizzas and pretty decent salads! This is a fast casual experience, and the location is always clean. They cater to different dietary needs/trends, so they also offer gluten free crust as well.  I like to play it safe when it comes to pizza and I'm usually happy with anything that's even remotely similar to a pepperoni pizza, so I usually have the Suprema pizza (which includes sausage, red peppers, red onions, and mushrooms), which is about $12 and can be split between two people if you're not totally famished. They also offer a Build Your Own pizza, where it starts out at $9 and each additional topping is a bit extra.  I've also had the chicken, spinach, and apple salad for $9 which is also pretty tasty and can be split between two people  as well. If you really want to get the most out of your experience, I'd definitely recommend getting a pizza and salad to split between two people.  They also offer other food items such as soups, paninis, and pastas (though these really aren't the main stars at this type of restaurant in my opinion). Either way, you're in old town and you've got some pretty cool areas just outside the restaurant that are fun to visit."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend and fellow Yelper and was pleasantly surprised.  Having driven past and seen only the \"Pizza Wine\" description, I thought this was a fancy Italian restaurant, as most are.  I found the menu to be quite compelling: a wonderful mix of unusual ingredients, freshly made.  And the style of service reminds me just a bit of Chipotle (one of my favorite fast food restaurants).  Meaning, the food is fresh, good, and reasonably priced.  And the restaurant is clean and modern without being fancy.  I am unable to give five stars only because I have only been here once.  (I haven't tested the consistency of the restaurant yet.)  There is much more that I want to taste, so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My sister and I dined here for lunch and had a really great experience!  The gal at the chase register was new and really nice. Her manager was there to help out and both of them couldn't have provided better service. They made sure my sister had a coloring sheet and crayons and delivered our food quickly.  I ordered the Italian chopped salad which was delightful and my sister got the kids pasta with red sauce, a great option for kids.  Right now on Yelp you can redeem a 10% off coupon. This location provides everything you are looking for, yummy food, prompt and fantastic service. They also have the best green tea in town, Passport Tropical Green Tea"}
{"text":"Solid pizza joynt, serving up lavosh style thin crust, in almost true Italian single serving fashion.  Nice touch with the casually sophisticated menu, offering up wild mushroom with arugula, parmesan (domestic?) and truffle oil pizzza.  Now that's not something I would expect to find in Mesa, AZ.  Wash it down with a few beer/wine selections and you're almost good to go.  All they're really missing is a few premium beer selections on tap, to round it all out nicely.  Service was friendly, with plenty of employees walking about ensuring a good experience for all patrons and making sure the place was clean.  Nice touch.  Outdoor seating was perfection, on this gorgeous Arizona evening, in a setting that I didn't even knew existed in Mesa.  It almost felt like being in Chandler, or Snottsdale, without the pretense.  Good times in the Sonoran desert!!!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant like this before and I LOVE IT!  I had the sausage and sauteed onion pizza with a glass of snoqualmie Riesling. I've never really been a fan of thin crusted pizza's but this was absolutely amazing!! The prices were extremely fair and lovable.   The ordering process was a little weird to me, as I've never experienced something quite like it before, You walk up to the counter, put your order in there (like a fast food place), pay then you walk over to the drink station and sit down and they bring you your meal. The service I received was fast and amazing!   Now that I have experienced Sauce I will definitely be coming for more!"}
{"text":"I saw someone tweet about the change in noodle type for the mac 'n cheese, and thought to myself, \"that seems a little dramatic, it's just a different noodle.\" I was so wrong. They changed from a shell noodle to a spiral noodle and had little cheese in the dish, needless to say I get why that person tweeted about it. Such a disappointment for a dish that used to be a staple for me there.  Otherwise, the food is good. Haven't had a salad or a pizza I didn't like.  It's winter so I understand they had the heater running, but it was uncomfortably warm. After ordering our beers and food and walking away, the cashier yelled after us that we can't take alcohol on the patio- would've been nice to know when I was ordering my beer so I wouldn't have had to sit in a sauna."}
{"text":"Sauce is a solid restaurant. I met up some family there for dinner and it was relatively quick, decently priced for fancy wood-fired thin-crust pizzas ($10 or so for a 12\" pizza). We ordered the Rosemary Potato and Olive Pizza which was unique and quite good, along with a side of Mac and Cheese which was not so good - I expected a little more flavor or pop in it. Our table also ordered a italian sausage combo pizza which was good, and a corn chopped salad which was quite tasty. Beer selection was limited to about 6 choices.  Comparatively, I'd rather go to a CPK. But this is also a solid choice. I'd come back to it again probably."}
{"text":"I think this place is hyped up a little more than it should be. I've tired their bruschetta, pizzas and salads. They were decent and I have no complaints but nothing to rave about. A decent place to pop in to for lunch since they have counter service that you order at."}
{"text":"Soooooooo good!! Would get 5 stars BUT gross restrooms. The food however, perfection."}
{"text":"Portions are small and over-priced but food was ok and prepared fast. They have an ok selection of wine and a patio area that faces a parking lot.   I ordered their pasta w/ meatballs and my husband ordered an over-priced 1/2 sandwich and small ceasar salad that was pretty good. Over all, the food tasted like Fazoli's."}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of Sauce, but we had a rough experience last night.  1. We were excited about the teacher discount. Showed her my id, and she never applied the discount.  2. I paid extra for ricotta cheese only to find out they added goat cheese (ew) 3. I asked specifically for my pizza to be well done. They gave it to me under done- I literally had to put it back in the oven because it was doughy  We'll probably just go somewhere else next time :/"}
{"text":"Sauce is another restaurant that I really want to like more, but just can't get any enthusiasm for every time I go there.  The two star rating is perfect for this place.  It's \"meh\".  Always just \"meh\".  It's never amazing, it's never terrible.  Even this review is gonna end up being \"meh\" simply because there's just nothing to say about the place.  If you're looking for something to eat that costs just a bit more than it's worth and leaves you feeling just a little unsatisfied, well then, Sauce is for you."}
{"text":"After reading a few reviews and desperately searching for the One Pizza To Rule Them All here in AZ, I decided it was time to try Sauce (also, I didn't want to study any more).  I'm not sure exactly what I expected, but Sauce wasn't it.  It was good.  Not great, but decent.  The food was fresh and hot.  It tasted fine, I just wasn't really thrilled by it.  I just felt like I could have ordered a pizza from the school cafeteria and would have gotten only slightly less quality (and no wine).  Oh, and the wine servings are very tiny.  Not a way to earn fans."}
{"text":"A friend and I tried Sauce when I was visiting Phoenix.   The menu consists of salads, pizza, flatbread, panini and pasta. My friend and I both ordered either the pizza or the flatbread. I can't remember which. About 15 minutes after we ordered a man came out and said that they were out of the dough that we ordered and asked if they could make us something else. We agreed. When they brought the pizza they gave us coupons for two free meals the next time we were there.  The pizza was decent. I thought it had good flavor but was pretty greasy.  I also got a side salad that was fine.  I appreciate the friendliness of the service but I probably wouldn't return. I've never had a problem before where they were out of one of their main ingredients. I just wouldn't risk it again."}
{"text":"I was a little reluctant to eat here given how the \"thin crust pizza\" was touted.  But the ingredients seemed quality, and the salads and other dishes people in there were eating (sparse at 2pm on a Sunday) looked good, so I gave it a shot.  And I'm so glad I did!  To picky pizza people out there --thin crust here does NOT mean cracker crust.  (I hate cracker crust!)  This pizza has a woodfire quality edge with a middle-of-pie limpness of New York style pizza.  Pretty near perfection, in my book.  I had a pretty basic margharita pizza or something --perfect size for one (hungry) person.    We had fountain drinks but you can get beer or wine, by the bottle or glass.  Very casual interior, with some limited (but nice in the experience of a Chicago girl in the winter) outdoor seating.  Definitely recommend, especially if you are weary of cracker crust pizza like me!"}
{"text":"I. Love. This. Place. I came her to order food to go. I ordered the lasagna pizza, pepperoni, Mac n cheese, and the roasted vegetable salad. I usually hate taking food to go because I always think it doesn't taste as good after it's been sitting. When I got home with my food, I was really happy that my order was correct and that my food still tasted good. The staff here is always friendly and always ready to help."}
{"text":"In the years and years and years of going to Sauce I have never once had a bad meal, in fact I always have a great meal. The chicken pasta broccoli and cheese is so mouth watering, their salads are always extremely fresh, for a fast casual restaurant their lasagna is surprisingly good too. All in all, Sauce is one of my favorite places to eat in old town when I'm looking for a quick delicious meal."}
{"text":"Sauce is a casual Italian restaurant that sells mostly pizza and sandwiches. Their pizzas are made on a really thin crust, almost like a pita, but even thinner. I had trouble deciding on which one to buy, so I got a create your own pizza. On my pizza, I added artichokes, prosciutto and fresh basil. I was pretty excited because I love artichokes and basil and the restaurant smelled really good! I ordered my pizza and walked next door to Urban Outfitters while I was waiting. (By the way, this is the sort of restaurant where you order your food and then either find a table or take it to go.) The pizza was ready in about 10 or 15 minutes.   Overall, I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed with the pizza I had at Sauce. I love the fact that the pizza is thin crust, but it was a little overcooked, so some of the edges were a bit burnt. The toppings weren't plentiful; I couldn't even tell there was basil on the pizza. Maybe my expectations aren't fair but when I order artichokes on pizza, I expect them to be a little bigger than they were here. The artichokes were tiny little pieces of artichoke, I could hardly see them. Sauce and cheese, however, had good flavor! Maybe I have to try a different pizza. A girl in line recommended the caesar salad pizza."}
{"text":"Honestly I love sauce and eat here OFTEN... but don't think I'll be returning this location due to the really crappy service. After waiting for awhile for my pickup order, while watching many employees chat and goof off, I went up to who I assume is the manager (light brown curly hair) who was standing leaning on the food counter with another employee chatting if she could help me with my To go order and she said \"nope! The register can help you. (Which is where I had been in line). As someone who worked in the bar & restaurant industry for 5 years this really really unimpressed me. Ended up waiting almost 20 minutes for my food. Pretty crappy."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Italian chopped salad. We also got a dinner roll with the salad, which was really good."}
{"text":"great pizza, apparently the pepperoni is in \"the top twenty\""}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time . I ordered  their panini  .the meats were very salty.ithe place is average  at best"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm just reviewing Sauce right now considering I've probably been there about 250 times since I started working in the Old Town Scottsdale area.  There's nothing really...bad about this place.  It may be construed as slightly overpriced given the fact that it's primarily used as a lunch spot but the quality of the food is good.  Two recommendations: 1.  Broccoli Chicken Cheese pasta if you are able to take a post-lunch nap. 2.  Roast beef panini if you aren't.  The pizza is definitely decent as well, service is prompt and fast especially given the fact that it seems like the entire city of Scottsdale descends upon the place like vultures between 12 and 1p.  Bottom line - between Culinary Dropouts, Olive and Ivy, and the greasy mall food (with the new exception of Pita Jungle!), there aren't a ton of options and Sauce may just be your best bet."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok. Not horrible, not great. You order at the counter and seat yourself. They have a nice patio here and the waitstaff is attentive in refilling your drinks.   I didn't like the little cup they served my white wine in. I like to hold a wine glass from the stem so I don't warm the wine with my hand. And if you order a red your serving hits just below the rim of the glass so you can't swirl your wine. Weird.   There wasn't anything that really stood out from this experience. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Such a cute little pizza shop with delicious pizza at great prices!  The personal pizzas are more than satisfying for one  definitely coming back here again"}
{"text":"Sauce is just OK in my opinion. Ordered the sausage and onion pizza (thick crust). Looked super thin, had to confirm with staff that it was thick crust. Thought the pizza was average. Staff was super nice. Location is great. It doesn't have a \"wow\" factor. 3/5 stars"}
{"text":"Met a new business partner and this place was clean, delicious and staff was super friendly! Salads are healthy and yummy! I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a casual lunch or a quick dinner after a day of shopping. It's nothing special, but it's comfortable, tasty and affordable. Uncomplicated, high quality pizza and salads...plus the lasagna is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Have not been here for awhile. Last experience was lacking. Decided to give Sauce another try..... Gift cards helped in this decision. Our group ordered pizza and the chicken salad with the pine nuts.  Pizza was The extra thin style, and I mean extra, extra thin. This was okay as this is what I remember it being. The topping was tasty.   What shocked me was how the salad had shrunk. There was very little greens and the chicken was extremely salty  I could not find one pine nut on my salad   I will not be going back as all three of us felt that it was not a filling meal. The salad was not a meal but really just a large side order.   The best part was the bread roll that went with the salad."}
{"text":"Go into Sauce on Waterfront. Order bowl of chicken noodle soup and Margharita Pizza. \"Chicken Noodle Soup\" comes out first. Soup is not remotely recognizable as Chicken Noodle Soup. I sincerely thought we had been given the wrong soup. Potatoes and an assortment of other vegetables in a thick stew like brew. Noodles??? No...that was not visible. Broth...not there.   So I checked if we had the wrong soup. So... An ignorant ass waitress(???) came over and said \"we do not get our soup From a can\" like I am a stupid idiot who only knows Campbell's soup. Are you fricking kidding me?  You stupid idiot. I have eaten in more upscale restaurants in the U.S. And Europe than she can even pronounce their names.   I know food from one end to the other. That soup is not chicken noodle soup by any cook's standard. Was it bad??  No. But, it is NOT chicken noodle soup by anyone standards who knows how to cook.   This happened between 5:00 - 6:00 pm on Oct 25, 2015. I will NEVER return to this place due to one stupid, stupid person who represents Sauce.  My husband stopped me from getting in this idiot's face.   Love Fox restaurants. I am still so pissed and insulted from this experience that I sure as hell will never return to Sauce anywhere."}
{"text":"On upon going to the bathroom a employee didnt close the door and kicked the door close.   In which he was throwing up after seeing this my appetite gone away."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 5+ years. Consistently good food, a laid-back ambiance, and they occasionally add new items that improve the menu. It is a fast casual concept - meaning that you place your order, take a number and they will bring it to you. This makes it the perfect format for a quick lunch or a nice, laid-back dinner. I love their pizzas because of the super-thin crust. And their salads are to-die-for. Mac and cheese is pretty wonderful, too. If I were to move out of state, Sauce Pizza and Wine would be one of the restaurants I would miss the most."}
{"text":"Worst ever meatball panni we have ever tasted!  Dry flat \"pita like\" bread,no sauce ,tiny slice of cheese And dry crunchy meatballs!! Ugh  Horrible!   I did take a pic but I figured I wouldn't  damn them that bad.   In the land of Italian restaurants ya gotta up your game a bit. This might past on somewhere like Three trees Texas but not here!  Belch!   (I decided everyone should see this, picture here  http://imgur.com/9Az52OZ)"}
{"text":"I really like Sauce, in fact, I've been liking it so much I think I've eaten here 3 times this week...yikes.  I don't have too much to say besides that their salads and pizzas have been pretty good. There is also something about their pizza that never makes me feel guilty for eating it. It's probably because it's so thin and appears healthy -- I don't know. You know...mind games....  Service has been great for me -- one time I unknowingly came in 10 minutes before the place was closing and they took my order without making me feel like the most hated person ever for coming in while they were trying to close. That is so rare! Right?!   Oh and did I comment on their iced tea? What the eff... that stuff is good!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and taken someone new each time. The only thing I've had is the Chicken Caesar Salad (why I only gave it 4 stars) but it's the best damned Caesar Salad I've ever had. I crave it. I ha d a CCS at a different place last night and it was... unsatisfying. Sauce had ruined CCS for me anywhere else.  Service? Smiling. Every time someone (manager?) has come around to our table to make sure we're happy. The place is clean and bright, and there's nice patio seating.   Someday I might try something else on the menu, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sauce is either hit or miss. It's a bit on the expensive side and suffers from mediocre management.   It's one of those semi self-serve places; you walk up to a cashier to order, seat yourself, wait for servers to bring your order to your table and they might also come around to ask you if you need anything such as a drink refill.  The ambiance is hip, comfortable and open which makes it an ideal spot to catch-up with friends.   An entree item (pizza or salad) will cost you around $10. The pizzas are scrumptious but I suggest getting normal/thin crust over their newer thick/pan crust. Every time I've had the thicker crust it's been over-cornmeal'd. Being on a budget, I usually order the mushroom and artichoke bruschetta and a soft drink for just under $7. If I can spend a bit more I'll go for the caesar salad, though I skip the unsatisfactorily dry, cold chicken add-on.  The service is even more hit-or-miss than the food. Their staff seems to have a high turn-over rate with the exception of a couple great food servers. I've had visits where the employees have been fantastic, and others where the cashiers have acted like I was doing them a favor. During a particularly unfortunate and embarrassing incident a young woman incorrectly took my order and when the resulting price was significantly more than it should have been I politely corrected her. She then stormed off into the kitchen and yelled at the staff, \"HE DOESN'T WANT THE PIZZA ANYMORE!! HE WANTS THE BRUSCHETTA NOW.\" loud enough to be clearly heard from the dining area. I should have then called a manager but instead I accepted the $7 embarrassment and wouldn't return for nearly six months.  I've since returned to satisfactory experiences. Hit or miss ... it's the risk you take."}
{"text":"We had the pine nut/chicken salad, very good, just the right amount of dressing. Pizza was pepperoni and mushroom again not to much sauce, (no pun intended ;) Overall, I can see this as a 'go to place' .   Side note: I will say the service impressed me, even though the busboy was working it, every time he passed our table, he asked if we needed anything and took care of whatever."}
{"text":"Every time it is perfect, fresh and prompt. Never get tire of it at any of their locations."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Sauce? It's a fantastic concept - pizza, salad and pasta (three of my favorite food groups) in a comfortable, stylish setting. The pizza crusts are paper thin, so they aren't too filling. The bread rolls they serve with the salad are yummy. The service is impeccable, with great attention to detail, which is a norm for all of Sam Fox's restaurant concepts. I have to say, I am a little biased - my husband worked here for 2 years and I have been coming here for 6 years. But it has never let me down!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their mac & cheese is amazing. Their pizza is out of this world! Fun salad choices. I go back whenever I can."}
{"text":"Stopped into Sauce for lunch yesterday and was delighted by the bustling little place. The menu offers a nice, but not large, selection of interesting pizzas and salads, plus a trio of lasagna offerings. We opted for a potato rosemary pizza, mozzarella and tomato salad and a chicken walnut salad. All were truly yummy ~ the pizza being my absolute favorite. I was surprised that the tomato mozzarella was lettuce salad. The pizza is served on a light crust, so not overly filling. Mom and I also indulged in a good glass of pino grigio. Total tab: $30.  The one hiccup in the place was service-oriented. This was the day after Christmas, so the place was packed. We ordered our food and drinks, but were told there weren't any seats available inside, and that our wine was not allowed on the outside patio. I asked the guy taking our order what he suggested we do, and he said we should not get the wine. Now, this was a mother-daughter shopping day, and we were going to have a glass of wine ~ we were actually thinking about going somewhere else when a manager-looking type said he had found a two-top for us. It was a cramped table, but we appreciated his service, and would only suggest finding a better solution than \"don't get the wine\" for future lunch and dinner goers."}
{"text":"We ordered a prosciutto and fig pizza. You get eight small thin slices but three of the slices won't have prosciutto or arugula. Kind of disappointing. Definitely great prices on the girls at the front counter are awesome. Only One star for the pizza but I get an extra star first service at the front."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Sauce now serves gluten free pizzas Valleywide!  We tried the chicken sausage poblano pizza on the gf crust and it came out doughy. The manager, Taylor, was very understanding that we wanted it cooked more - she offered not only to make us a new pizza but also took it off the bill and let us try another white sauced gluten free pizza! Very unexpected but much appreciated.  They're still working out the kinks of getting the crust not too doughy vs not too burnt, but I'm so happy they have the option now!   Meanwhile, the chicken Cesar salad without the croutons is still one of my favorites!  Always quick service too!"}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza person and only order them occassionally. But i do like thin pizza. Tried several different ones with friends, not bad at all.  Place was clean. Server was okay.   I wont say that I would be back just to get pizza here hence cant decide whether I should put it a 3 or a 4. I guess considering I dont have negative experience a 4."}
{"text":"Great place... good food. They also have beer and wine.. obviously, lol.  I guess someone didn't want an order of their mac & cheese and was offered a free plate. It was soooo good."}
{"text":"Great experience. It's been a while since we have been here but we usually come at least once a summer for their summer deal. When we got there the line was out the door and only seating outside was available. It was extremely hot and my wife is 6 months pregnant. I asked the gentleman giving numbers out for seating if he could find us a seat inside. He separated a four top into an extra two top and got us a seat inside for my wife. When our food came out they brought out our Mac n cheese but told us that they charged us for a full and only brought out a side. We appreciated their honesty because we would have never noticed otherwise. Pizza and salad were very good and it was a great price. Definitely a place we recommend."}
{"text":"I like to describe this place as the italian version of Pei Wei, only not as tasty.   I have been 3 times now and never have I been like \"I'm glad I ate that\".   I heard from a ton of ppl that their mac and cheese was so good, well despite that it was cold and the noodles were undercooked, slightly crunchy, when I got it, it might have been decent bc the cheese sauce was flavorful.   I first went here with my old roommate when we had an intense craving for spaghetti with meatballs. you would think a place called Sauce would serve that, but nope.   The pizza was so-so but not worth the price. and forget about that lame little roll they give you.   Ya, I'd rather not. Hop over to olive and ivy next door and spend a few extra bucks on their pizza which is by far better."}
{"text":"I love pizza and decided to give this place a try. I wasn't very pleased with the quality of food. Basically it was a a cracker with some sauce and cheese. If you're looking for delicious excellent high quality wood fired pizza, I would recommend Lamp pizzeria at Pinnacle Peak. Well worth it."}
{"text":"goooooodness gracious !!! I don't remeber the last time I ate something SOOOOO good!!!"}
{"text":"SCRUMPTIOUS! Their summer deal of a pizza, appetizer, and two glasses of wine for $20 or $25 (I forget) was an awesome deal. Every pizza I've has been delicioso, the wine was great, the caprese was wonderful, and their caesar salad is fantastic. I'm a fan!   When the weather is nice, I love sitting on the patio and people watching. It's a great combo between a full-service restaurant and a fast-food place."}
{"text":"Had a great pasta dish  ( chicken, broccoli, with mozzarella sauce) Actually very good.  Only complaint I could say was listening to the cook and his annoying whistling."}
{"text":"Sauce Pizza  gave us the nastiest pizza ever! To make matters worse, this isn't even what we ordered. We had ordered the bruschetta.  To top it off, this was supposed to be a romantic anniversary picnic dinner. Good thing the wine was good!"}
{"text":"Good thing they call it Sauce and not Pasta...they take 'al dente' to an extreme, methinks.  Our Norwegian exchange daughter who needs gluten free says they have the best gluten free options in Phoenix.  The sauce is very tasty, but the pasta is very chewwwwy...(better after microwaving at home to reheat).    Have gotten the meatball sandwich, too - panini style (wrong bread, IMHO, for a meatball sub).  The apple salad is my wife's favorite.  For me, meh, but the girls like it a lot, so 3 stars."}
{"text":"It is a bit shocking to me that people like this place so much.  Have they just not had a really good pizza before?  I really don't get it.  The first time I tried Sauce, I went with the hand-stretched chicken pesto pizza.  It was OK - good crust, but a little too sparse on the toppings.  I really wish when they made these pesto pizzas that they'd try to make the pesto stand out a little more.  They always try to go light on the pesto because people in Arizona hate things that taste good, and pure, unadultered pesto tastes good.  My recent visit, I went to the Dana Park location, and I made a huge mistake - I accidentally ordered the thin crust.  I blame the person behind the register for not reminding me that they have two crusts (good, and pure sh*t), and of course, by default, they give you that horrible cracker crust.  So my meal was effectively ruined, even though I felt I made a solid choice with the portobello and artichoke.  People might tell you Sauce is good, and they might have even been eating their awful cracker crust pizza - but make no mistake, that crust is the worst.  If you get the flatbread pizza, you will be getting a much more average pie, and it may even be a reasonable choice for the Mesa/Gilbert area.  But I give them two stars just for offering that abortion of a crust as the standard option."}
{"text":"Been here several times now. Ordered something different this time: Soppresetta Bruschetta, small Mac and Cheese plus a drink for $14.39.   I arrived at 11:45 on a Thursday and it was 3/4 full. A few students mixed in cuz Scottsdale students could afford it.   For the bruschetta, the bread was buttered, toasted, soft and tangy. There was whipped goat cheese, baby asparagus, chopped artichoke hearts and the salami, which was plentiful. There was also s pesto spread on the bread, balancing it all out I really enjoyed that dish.   The pasta was cooked al dente, saucy, if a bit runny. 5\" bowl was plenty big for a big guy like me.      First time at this sauce. Arrived for lunch at 11:30 on a Friday and it was 1/3 full with no one in line.   I ordered my usual: Chicken Caesar Salad and a soft drink for $12.25.  It arrived quickly, within 5 mins.   The poached chicken was nicely shredded, which made for chicken in every bite. The romaine lettuce was fresh, if a bit bitter. Can't blame that on them tho. My salad was well dressed. The croutons were still tooth shattering, just like the other locations.   The sourdough roll that comes with the salads was warm, fresh and chewy, as good sourdough should be.   Good lunch overall"}
{"text":"First time here. Had there chicken broccoli pasta not the best. The sauce was not that good as other people kept saying it would be. Probably will go back to try their pizzas."}
{"text":"On my way home from a hard day at work, I stopped at Sauce to check out their menu. Sauce is a very casual restaurant with an order at the counter style.  I like this type of ordering when I am on a time limit or when ordering to-go (as I did today). The large menu is full of wine selections, 13 choices of salad, soups, wood fired pizza (creative blends and made to order), panini  and bruschetta.   There are a multitude of gluten free options and a nice kids menu for the little ones.  I ordered macaroni and cheese and a roasted vegetable salad.  The salad was a taste sensation with roasted acorn squash, Brussels sprouts, walnuts on deep greens.  While waiting I looked at the dessert choices of tiramisu, cookie pizza and cannoli -- to name a few.    After a brief wait, I took my delicious dinner home and was 100% satisfied."}
{"text":"One of the best thin crust pizzas in Mesa. Have been twice this week. Had the sausage and wild mushrooms. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Okay, so we finally made it to Sauce. and we were mostly happy with our experience.   Sauce is an Italian themed pizza and sandwich place that serves wine. Currently, they are running a summer special of: two glasses of wine, one large salad and one personalized pizza for $20.00.  A GREAT DEAL!  Since our first visit earlier this summer, we've been back a few times and the food has been universally good.    For some reason, we go around 4:30 or so on Thursdays or Fridays afternoons before a movie and the place is usually half full. The downside in going at this time is that Sauces is full of screaming infants or toddlers with indifferent supervision (see photo).   We have seen very few male parents at Sauce, but mostly young mothers who are meeting with other Moms for a play date at the restaurant. For the most part the Moms will take five or six tables at the far end away from the cashier, but the noise can sometimes be overwhelming. Also, the three and four year olds are known to sometimes escape from their prison with pasta soaked hands .   So, go for the food, but avoid the Mom's section in the back, and don't wear white!  Okay, you've been warned."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Sauce a couple times now with our almost-three year old; during off hours, so there was no line and we received our food very quickly. The second time we went, they made the wrong pizza, but went ahead and brought that to the table so we could nibble on it while we waited for what we ordered. It certainly made the preschooler happy.   No complaints about the service. The food was tasty - a refreshing variation on the typical pizza joint. Salad is important to me and I'm pleased with the offerings here; I enjoyed the Caprese salad and my husband had the Chicken Walnut.   The pizza features a cracker-like thin crust - exactly the kind I favor. Loved the sausage and caramelized onion topping. The only thing I don't like about this restaurant is how easy it was for me to overeat. NOM NOM  We ordered the $4 side of shell pasta with a meatball and marinara for our little one. That generous portion ended up being lunchtime leftovers he enjoyed for the following two days in a row. If you split pizzas and salad, the portions are more than adequate and it's not a bad value at all, even for a larger group.   It's kind of like fast food for foodies..."}
{"text":"My husbands pizza was pretty good but I got the pasta with marinara and it was inedible.   There was little to no sauce, the pasta was so over cooked it was pasty and gummy and I ended up throwing it out.   Skip the pasta, order a pizza...at least you'll be able to eat the pizza :P"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a very good dinner at Sauce.  We ordered their summer special consisting of:  a medium pizza, delicious salad and two glasses of wine for the mere price of $20. It was a great deal for a great price."}
{"text":"If you have time to wait in the long line and cash to pay for the moderately overpriced food, this isn't too bad.   Since I was feeling diet-y and would rather spend money on my new christmas-cash clothes, I just got a panini sandwich and water for 11$.  Pretty good, shared my sista's salad, slightly better than what you can get for 6$ at another small Italian owned place.  Great sidewalk viewing for all the Cindy McCains walking down the sidescape."}
{"text":"Great place: came with the family and they tolerated our long indecision without grimacing.  The space is large, lively, and open and sunny in the Arizona glare.   I had a fig pizza which was just the right size, the crunchy thin crust was amazing.    Fountain drinks are self service, I would frequent here were I in town more!"}
{"text":"First time ever .. Staff are very friendly and the place it's clean ... my recommendation will be the Italian panini or pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms"}
{"text":"I finally checked it out and I think its my least favorite of the fox restaurants.  Its like the little caesars of fancy pizza.  I'll actually take little caesars next time since i can get more than double the food...  Upon further reflection, it tastes kind've like grade school cafeteria pizza.."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, always for the Caesar Salad. Croutons haven't changed, unfortunately.   They recently updated the menu and added an Italian Chopped Salad, for $2 more than the Caesar. It was delivered in 16 mins, despite only 1/8 full today. Not sure why.   The salad was very eye appealing but the flavors were a mixed bag.  It had greens, deli meats and provolone plus kalamata olives, fried chickpeas, onions, cucumbers and roasted tomatoes. My only issue was really the dressing. It was a garlic vinaigrette but tasted like oil and a few spices. Perhaps it wasn't mixed well? I didn't get the slightest hint of garlic or vinegar. Too bad cuz it sounded good.   I think I'll go back to my Caesar Salad which I like. I just wish the croutons weren't so hard."}
{"text":"Honestly, doesn't matter the occasion, sauce is always good quick fun easy spot to go or even take out. I've been coming to sauce for many years and it's always remained the same. Same quality every time, same experience so it's nice that they have consistency. You can't go wrong with the pizza. I always do a side pasta and side salad. Can't really tell you which because they're all good so it's just up to your preference."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try sauce for awhile... Well I finally made it!  I did not try their pizza, I had the Prosciutto, Salami, Turkey, Red Onion, Tomato salad instead which was yummy.  It was the perfect amount of food, but if i was really hungry I don't think I would have left satisfied.  My lunch mate had one of their panini's which was all the ingredients of my salad minus the lettuce.  He seemed to really enjoy that too.  I would surely come back and try other things on the menu, their pizzas looked really good too."}
{"text":"I get all of the Fox RC emails and yesterday received one about a limited time lunch special for $7.50 for 2 of either a side chopped salad, soup of the day or side pasta (lasagna not included) and a drink. A couple of co-workers and I decided to hit it up today and I was pleasantly surprised. Not that I had assumed it was bad or anything- I'd just never been.   I had the turkey and feta salad because it had the most veggies-cucumbers, tomatoes, corn and avocado's and  tender turkey squares. It was really good! So was the pasta- marinara shells with a meatball. It was a perfect amount of food for a great price."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. I substituted cucumbers for the Gorgonzola cheese on my salad and was charged $1. The cashier never told me I would be charged which is upsetting. I paid $1 for a few cucumbers, really???? Then the salads chicken was not good- I got hard pieces that I couldn't eat. Very disappointed w Sauce. They need to step up their game."}
{"text":"Such a great place with great service! We stopped in after the mall to grab a quick bite to eat and I am so happy we did! My husband had a pizza & I had the caprese  salad. Both were incredible! At the end they brought us over a pizza someone didn't pick up to take home with us! So nice of them! we will definitely come back when we are visiting the area again!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to when I'm around Fashion Square or wanting a quick bite.  You cannot beat their Chicken Pine Nut Salad, Mac & Cheese, or any of their Pizza's (Chicken Pesto or Pepperoni) for the price!"}
{"text":"While Sauce is always good, this time wasn't our favorite. Pizza was a bit too burnt and lacked its flavor. Service was great. We aren't sure if it's this location or just an off night."}
{"text":"This place is great. Think fast food Italian style but everything is made fresh. The ingredients are wonderful and their wine is delicious too (especially for the price). For around $20 two people can enjoy a pizza and two glasses of wine.   I recommend this place to those that are in the mood for good Italian food but don't feel like the typical delivered pie or the expense of some other sit down Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a friendly staff.  Lots of options and all reasonably priced.   Great place for lunch or dinner.  Love the outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Aweful attitude from the servers and the food was disgisting and too expensive. I will never go here again and neither will any of the people that were with us."}
{"text":"We stopped in last weekend on the pet friendly patio to enjoy a nice lunch of pizza!  The servers were so friendly and welcoming and loved having our pup on their patio.  They actually took our order at the table, so one of us didn't have to go in and leave the other and the pup - nice touch!  We enjoyed a sausage and caramelized onion pizza and a smoked ham and mushroom pizza - crispy, flavorful and delicious!"}
{"text":"It was our st visit to this Norterra location & it turns out our cashier/host Michelle is also a manager. She explained the process of ordering, allowed us to make exceptions like minus cheese & offered her opinion/ recommendation. They went WAY out of there way buy getting my toddler a hot chocolate which isnt on the menu. We had several servers bringing our food, clearing dishes, checking in on us & one even added dessert to our order w/o us having to get back in line. It was very busy when we arrived but cleared out which leads me to believe they flow with the movie theater times? Anyhow, I highly recommend the specials as we were all happy with every aspect of our Sauce experience."}
{"text":"Love this whole chain but I really really LOVE this location. Sometimes I need to carb load the day or two before a long run and the last thing I care to do is valet park and wait in long lines at other Italian restaurants in Central Phoenix. I enjoyed a wonderful dinner and conversation with Tamra on Friday evening. She's vegan (Ugh!) and enjoyed her grand salad. I usually get the Mac & Cheese with Three Meatballs and a salad. It's the right amount and so delicious. Staff is and has always been helpful. I always leave full and satisfied. Thank you! Cheers***"}
{"text":"decent italian restaurant with interesting combinations and presentations.  my friends and I got 3 pizzas, a salad, and mac n cheese to go. we got the arugula/mushroom, proscuitto/melon, and potato rosemary/olive tapenade pizzas.  one regular crust and 2 flat crusts.  all were good but my fav one was the arugula mushroom.  they were generous with the proscuitto and decorated the pizza nicely with slices of thin cantaloupe/honeydew.    the vegetable salad was just a combo of chopped up veges.  fresh but ok mac and cheese wasnt the best. texture of the cheese sauce reminded me of kraft mac n cheese...  overall decent"}
{"text":"Just got a togo order and I got home and opened my salad and was disappointed... do they really think I want to eat the massive piece (size of a golf ball) of pink and all fat veiny hard chicken???? Nasty. Should be more cautious when filling the order of gross chicken :( I'm so disgusted I can barely finish my salad."}
{"text":"Thankfully these guys make it right when they screw up, but let me tell you how many times I've had to come back to get a new pizza made. It's not like I'm customizing my pizza, I'm ordering what's on your menu!!!! I expect my gluten free pizza to be gluten free because I have Celiac's disease. This is not a choice I made, I have a disease! I'm not just some pretentious hipster deciding to go GF because they want to lose weight- I'M ALLERGIC!!!!so not only was my pizza not GF but it didn't have goat cheese on it. Goat cheese, dig, prosciutto and arugula pizza. On your menu!!!! How do you screw that up?"}
{"text":"We were looking for another restaurant when we walked past Sauce. We had a long active day and were hungry and tired. This wasn't at all what I had in mind but my husband thought it looked good and I was hungry.   Long story short, I went from exhausted, hungry and not looking forward to a meal that wasn't even close to what I was desiring to immensely pleased. We both loved our meals and drinks. Service was good too.   We will make the drive occasionally since there isn't one closer but we really wish there was one on the east side!"}
{"text":"Yes it is popular for pizza and wine, but their salads are awesome!  I love the turkey feta or the chicken apple!!  I am definitely a fan and will continue to go back to any of their locations!"}
{"text":"Was pretty underwhelmed by this place. Everything is made pretty fresh but it's just kind of basic. Probably won't be headed back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I did hear bad reviews about this place... but I went in here, and I actually kinda liked it.    The salads are great (I had the chicken, walnut and apple with spinach), the pasta (meatballs... YUMMY) is excellent.    It's cool that you can get a glass of wine with it.    It's VERY casual and the service is good.  It's reminiscent of a Pei Wei, but with italian.  Good for a quick stop in."}
{"text":"This place is very inconsistent. Sometimes the pizza and salad are great and sometimes like today they are disappointing. The vegetable salad was not fresh and the pizza had too much red sauce to a point that pizza tasted sour. This is not specific to this location. We have dined at the Nortera and Fashion square locations and inconsistency in quality is same."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most inconsistent places I have ever eaten at, and unfortunately more often than not its bad.. one day it is great service and food the next you are waiting 45 mins for a salad that tastes like dog food...  I have eaten here a lot and pick up for my office but we have taken this place out of the rotation for months and gave it another shot today... well 45 mins waiting so far for 5 plates. 1/2 full dining room, so not sure why they cannot keep up.. I will not be coming back anytime soon...  salad was good today except the chicken was a blob in the center."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch this weekend and had the \"mix it\" thing with 1/2 salad and 1/2 panini.  I had the house salad with the Gorgonzola vinaigrette and the roast beef panini.  The panini was excellent but the salad was not.  The dressing lacked flavor.  I'm going to stick to the Caesar."}
{"text":"Stopped here for takeout, and had pasta and meatballs. The dish was tasty, the little cupped-shaped pasta held the sauce nicely, and the meatballs tasted \"authentic\" Italian, whatever that means - they were different from the ones I make at home. It was a large portion, and I enjoyed it. The staff behind the counter was helpful in explaining the different menu choices."}
{"text":"Sauce is one of our go to's for dinner when we don't want a super big meal or a fancy outing. It's especially great since we have two kids. We love the sausage and mushroom pizza, The prosciutto and fig pizza, all of their salads - especially the turkey and feta, and my daughter loves the pasta. Even their iced tea is really good! Staff is always very friendly and prices are reasonable. A great place to go when you're out and about in the Norterra area."}
{"text":"Dinner for two was about $35 for a large salad and two personal pizzas. Very good for a chain restaurant and hot and piping pizza out of the oven. Would def come back for a quick meal or wine night."}
{"text":"This is by far my absolute favorite fast casual restaurant. I love the salads, I love the pizza, but what I really Love is the caprese bruschetta. I just walked over the the Waterfront intending on eating at Zoes Kitchen. Then I remembered Sauce and knew exactly what I wanted. Service is good, never great but the food is just so darn good it makes up for any thing lacking with service. Now, don't get me wrong there's nothing really wrong with the service but it's not what keeps me coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Today my brother and family came in for a quick birthday lunch. The food was excellent, but more importantly the service was particularly noticeable. Perry, who took our order, delivered our food and quality check us and brought boxes. It's refreshing to have attentive and consistent service at a place where it's unusual order and take a number. Very impressive. Thank you so much for making it that much more special!"}
{"text":"Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water. It's my mom and I's go-to lunch spot. You can sit outside and enjoy the nicer weather in fall, or sit inside. The prosciutto and fig pizza is a must-get. It's unique and tastes like Italian heaven. I also can't go without getting the chicken, apple and spinach salad. Perfect amount of dressing, the chicken is coated with the sauce, and the combination of the pecans and cheese is delightful.   When they have their in-house lemonades, DO NOT PASS THEM UP. I consider myself a lemonade addict and they really know what they're doing with it. On top of the good food, the service is excellent and so quick. We usually sit down immediately and our food is brought out within 15 minutes. I have nothing but love for this place. It definitely will become your fav lunch spot too."}
{"text":"It was good....but nothing special. ..had the portable lo bruschetta appetizer and it was very good...has a pesto chicken pizza...never found any chicken on it but plenty of pesto, got thin crust bad idea..way to crunchy, but the pizza over all.was ok. Good wine selection as well as beer but they don't brew their own beer which sucks. Undecided if we'll come back again or not."}
{"text":"All I got to say is that this place \"SUCKS\". From the ARROGANT manager to the bad service, nasty food and high prices. I have been here before and didn't have a good experience,  thought I give them one more chance but this is IT!!!..."}
{"text":"I love Sauce and I'm a fairly regular customer at HV location, but I've gone twice now in the past week when the line was to the front door and there was only one register open to take orders. Food quality is still delicious but the service has gone down a bit."}
{"text":"I love the salads at Sauce. The quinoa, beat and arugula salad is by far my favorite. The salads are reasonably priced and made fresh when ordered. The summer special of $20 for two drinks, one pizza and one salad is a steal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I probably eat at Sauce once every two weeks. The beet, quinoa and arugula salad is fantastic. I always add corn to this salad. The summer sampler of a salad, pizza and two drinks for $20 is a great deal. We have taken advantage of this offer several times this summer. The wine and beer selection is decent and the staff is always super friendly. Stop by this restaurant for an easy, quick delicious meal the family will surely love."}
{"text":"Impressive job done at this restaurant, as soon as you walk in you feel a warm welcome, their pizza has a very unique taste. I can't wait to return again, i want to send a shout out to the manager tiffany who has a very well trained team that night."}
{"text":"This place is great! Especially if you are trying to get food quickly and not have to wait. The service was wonderful and the food tasted delicious. The staff was on their game for sure and had a good flow going. The place was very clean. It's almost like a Panda Express but instead you get pizza, salads and pasta. I highly recommend to try the Tuscan tomato soup. One of my friends told me to try it and I guarantee you, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I have been here about 6 more times since my last review and it is really starting to grow on me.  The place is always clean, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff is always helpful, friendly and pretty speedy.  Also, aside from the prosciutto and melon pizza; they are all very good."}
{"text":"we ended up at Sauce before the oregon pep rally for the national championship game, mainly because we were already in the area and it wasn't too busy.  it's one of those places where you order from the counter, find a seat, and they bring the food out to you when it's ready.  the pizza is thin crust, which i like, but it really have much flavor, which was disappointing.  the atmosphere left something to be desired as well.  i didn't love it, i didn't hate it, it was ok.  i would go back again out of convenience, but it wouldn't be a destination spot for me."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service.  The staff is friendly and the establishment is always clean when we are here. My son is a picky eater but enjoys the pizza. High chairs are in the back, so just ask for one if you need it for your little one."}
{"text":"Walked into Sauce yesterday for lunch since it was recommended...after looking over the menue Board on the wall...my Son and I were turned off by the difficulty of reading looking up at a portion of the wall menue that stretched 10 ft.  The noise of the lunch crowd was terrible and was like we were in a tunnel...a real turnoff in itself. They may have good food but I would end up outside just to escape the echo. As it was...plenty of customers but as a Senior I will not return...I need a less expansive way to view and make my choice before ordering. I do not require a waiter but like movie theatres...hate crooning my neck and feeling rushed by a lineup of customers in front and behind. Not fun to feel rushed and unable to peruse the whole menu easily. We left and went to Zappone's."}
{"text":"Sauce is amazing. It is my go to spot for a quick work lunch break. The service is impeccable and the staff is friendly & attentive. The Italian chopped salad (new item) is my absolute favorite! :)"}
{"text":"Introduced to Sauce just recently and I am hooked. Great food - not too many options for vegetarians but still a good amount of them. Friendly staff and the food came out really quickly!"}
{"text":"Ding! Approved.  Okay okay, it's not Cibo or Bianco. But really, should you be expecting that? Given the price, speed and great service, this place is absolutely worth it. The staff is young, friendly, energetic and welcoming. The menu is focused and food well prepared. Quality ingredients are used to make for a tasty light lunch. Everything is served up very quickly and with a big smile.  This is definitely going in my regular rotation of lunch spots!"}
{"text":"I have tried two Sauce locations now and both were positive experiences. Today I tried the feta turkey Salad and it was tasty! It's hard to mess up pasta, but this place truly has the mac and cheese down to a perfect science."}
{"text":"Wow - what a yummy meal.    We had the wild mushroom truffle pizza, rosemary potatoe, and chicken sausage pizza and all were outstanding.   Perfectly cooked.    Server guides us to their special and saved us money and got us more food in the process (get salad and pizza, get two glasses of wine for only $20!).    Service was exceptional.    So nice to eat such a flavorful pizza, and feel good afterwards (instead of comatose like most American pizza)."}
{"text":"Decent pies and salads, amazing service tableside. The entire staff was friendly and very committed to clearing the table of unnecessary dishes, checking in with us to see if we needed anything else and even offered us a Halloween candy treat. Bravo Zulu..."}
{"text":"I wandered in here as a rush effort for some calories before my friends and I were headed to Fashion Square... its quick and relatively cheap.. Im not much for counter service places.. here you order at the counter and they table serve you from there.. AND I freak out over pasta..but they have a good selection of salads... so we were okay..and I dont have to be the high maintenance girl amongst my other girls! BUT... maybe Olive & Ivy down the street would have been a better choice.. not for anything other than my own personal taste!"}
{"text":"A great place to grab a tasty bite if you aren't feeling the food court at Fashion Square.  Delish plates! My personal favorite is the Chicken & Broccoli pasta. Simply divine.  They also have a small wine & beer selection in case you're looking to have a drink.  Love it!"}
{"text":"The management at this location should be reprimanded if not fired. They allowed 2 girls in bikinis into the restaurant during a very busy dinner service. Numerous customers spoke amongst ourselves & then to management regarding the inappropriate attire. They claimed the girls were to they could order food to go. Why then did they allow them to sit down next to a family with young kids? The family walked out. The young couple sitting next to us also walked out. We were there to celebrate a birthday with our two young teenage daughters. We left our meals unfinished & left. The manager on duty was unresponsive. We USED TO visit this restaurant regularly, until tonight. I checked unsure for attire as it appears ANYTHING is acceptable!"}
{"text":"Came to the new location again on 1st Street & Camelback. It was great to see Laura the new manager she was on 7th  Street & Glendale. This place was rocking! Perfect central location. :)"}
{"text":"Screw the soggy ass pizza... it's all about the spinach and pancetta salad. This little salad earned 3 stars all by it's lonesome.  Really though... if you are going to be a pizza joint and serve thin crust pizza... learn how to make it a crispy crust. I should be able to pick up my slice and not have it point south thankyouverymuch!"}
{"text":"I am torn between 3 and 4 but it takes a lot to be bumped to 4.   I really like the atmosphere here and been coming here for years even before Fox concepts sold it off. I am glad they kept most if not all the menu items on here. Especially the chicken, broccoli and cheese pasta. It is and always will be my go to. The pizza is also good and the rolls with butter are always on point (sometimes I get an extra roll if I want the most carbs in life.ssshhh).  It is good for a quick lunch as it's convenient from where I am working and live around. The service is usually pretty good they are pretty quick with orders. They get lunch and do it at lunch speeds.   Here is the issue. The last 3 times I have been, my favorite pasta dish isn't what it used to be at all. Specifically this last round. It is usually pretty creamy and a little thicker. This time it was almost watery. There was no richness to it and the cheese sauce was just lacking from previous experiences. I am not sure why it was running and watered down but it didn't taste good at all and very disappointing. I don't return food unless it is absolutely needed because I don't want to waste it but it was off.   Just because I give 3 stars doesn't mean I won't go back, just might not be my first choice where to eat. I really like Sauce, I've just seen it dwindle from past experiences when Fox owned it."}
{"text":"Wow- so not impressed. Will definitely not come back.  Edible but that's the best I can say about our visit. Caesar salad was over-dressed and soggy. Pizza had almost no sauce and even less cheese. The cheese it did have was over-cooked -not burnt but it was crispy and tasted awful. The pasta was bland kind of like cafeteria food. In fact the entire visit was like being at a cafeteria. You ordered your food before you knew you would have a table to eat at-- thankfully we got one before our food came but just barely. Then you feel rushed to leave because you see people standing and waiting for a table-- NOT RECOMMENDED, not even for take-out. Very Disappointing"}
{"text":"I ordered there featured salad roasted winter vegetable to go.  The wait was a little long  the salad had roasted Brussel sprouts and butternut squash in it that was so hard I couldn't eat it.  Wish I had gone for the  pizza!"}
{"text":"We ate at Sauce for their 2 for $20 summer deal yesterday for lunch.  We ordered the caesar salad (which was a good portion for 2 to share), the chicken pesto pizza (which by the way is a white pizza, we didnt find this out until it came to our table but the manager offered to add pizza sauce to it which made it even better) and two glasses of wine.  Sauce is a good place that I tend to forget about because the pizza is in my opinion forgetable.  The staff was nice and prompt which lead me to give the 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Just love Sauce! If you want something fast fresh and delicious this is your place! Love their thin crust pizzas, delicious tasty salads. They also now offer sangria."}
{"text":"If you like very thin crust pizza this is a place you will enjoy. The salads and mac and cheese is also very good. Service is very quick and the employees are kind and helpful.  If you check in on yelp you will get 10% off. Feed a family of seven tonight for $42.00. Not bad."}
{"text":"Really, better sauce comes in a jar!  No basil on caprese salad, and swimming in dressing.  But what do I know.  Never had caprese salad with dressing."}
{"text":"Where do I begin..  Caprese Salad - Yes Pasta, Red sauce & mozzarella - Yes Mac 'n cheese - Yes Roasted Portobello & Artichoke bruschetta (or any of the bruschettas) - Yes Suprema Pizza - Yes  There are so many more dishes I would like to try but I always get caught up on my regulars. Whatever time of day you come, is always a good experience.  Sauce is always fast and fresh foods to cure any appetite.  Sauce is a great addition to the local Italian bistro market, they truly have all types of pastas, pizzas, panini's and salads!  The service is extremely friendly in addition to the convenience of a casual restaurant.  Job well done!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in about year... New staff.. Very friendly! I have been coming to Sauce for the lady 5 yrs. I go to the location on 7th str & Glendale.. Love that they know what I'm going to order before I get to the counter :)"}
{"text":"Sauce is one of the more popular Sam Fox restaurants in my area, and for good reason.   They have everything from salads (the quinoa, beet, arugula is my fav) to pizzas (the prosciutto and fig is a can't miss) to pasta (MAC N CHEESE THO) to paninis to soups to desert and even yummy drinks (local beer and fresh lemonade and lots of wine!!)  It's a relaxed, urban/trendy atmosphere. You go up to the counter to order and they bring your food to your table. The service is quick and the people that work there are friendly. I love getting food to go from here - they have never mixed up my order and it's just as good as it is when you dine in.   They also have EXCELLENT gluten free options here, so that's always a plus!   Prices are fair for the quality of the food - everything is fresh and made to order.   Every time I come here I seem to run into someone I know! It's a great family-friendly, neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Always super.  Pricing slowing creeping up but love eating here when we're in town.  Pizza, pasta, meatballs, casual atmosphere, soups, salads.  All good."}
{"text":"My family and i went into this location for lunch today. The staff and food was amazing. I had my 8 mo old twins with me and needed a little extra help and the staff went out of their way to help and make my lunch easer! Lee was very helpful and kind. I will be back to this location for sure."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill since it switch from Sam Fox restaurant group. The salad I got today for take out had a large handful or old brow/red lettuce! Disgusting."}
{"text":"I used to really like their turkey panini for some reason. Simple. Perfect. Right amount of turkey and cheese and pesto aioli, at the right temperature with the right crunchiness.   But now it's served cold on a ciabatta bun, and it tastes like every other boring, overpriced cold turkey sandwich with too much turkey and bland, dry bread.   Meh."}
{"text":"I have to say that the concept of this restaurant is a hit in my book.  I love the casual atmosphere and how quick the food comes out. I think the concept is great in that they offer a few items done multiple ways - the menu isn't overwhelming but there is something for everyone. I've never had a single service issue like other people mention.   The Turkey and Feta chopped salad is my favorite and I like the thin crust pizzas. My boyfriend loves the lasagna. Sauce is a quick, reasonably priced option and a great alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch again today!  Had the roasted vegetable salad again and added a cup of white bean soup.  Really hit the spot.  All the veg had a nice roasted caramelization. So good!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Sauce. Every time I come here, I love the food. It's very simple, very causal, and very easy.   The service is (most of the time) excellent! There really isn't much server interaction because you order at the counter and they bring you the food, but the counter people always seem to be happy and in a good mood.   The food is really good. I usually always order the Caesar salad with a side of mac and cheese. The Caesar salad is really good. Lettuce is always crisp and fresh, and there is a nice balance between lettuce and salad dressing. It's the worst when you order a salad and it ends up swimming in dressing. But not at sauce. It is a nice portion of dressing, which has a really nice flavor. The mac and cheese is my favorite part. It's extremely creamy and not overbearingly cheesy. The pasta is cooked right to al-dente and its never soggy or mushy. The bread is also really good. They have warm mini ciabatta rolls that they serve with butter that are super good as well!   The only con is not being able to find seating sometimes.  But hey, if that's the worst it is at Sauce, I can definitely deal with that!"}
{"text":"I love Sauce! I have been here once and will definitely be back. The food was great! They were kinda busy and our food arrived in no time. The service was caring, helpful and friendly. I really have no complaints!  The portobello, artichoke, goat cheese bruschetta has to be the best thing I've ever tasted! It's so good and feeds four people for only four and a half dollars. (As an appetizer and everyone gets a piece)."}
{"text":"So the first signs of new ownership/management at sauce point toward what I have come to expect from this restaurant group. I received a prompt response 14 days ago asking for my email to discuss the issues further. I promptly responded and haven't heard a word since. That was two weeks ago. I'm not looking to have a long drawn out conversation over this but don't ask for contact information indicating you care if you really have no intention of discussing or learning about the issues further."}
{"text":"I love this place for a casual and delicious lunch. This location is super easy to find and has great customer service and food.   I've been to Sauce a few times (one at Fashion Square and the other at this location). Both times the food was great.   At this location, I ordered the pasta with red sauce and meatballs. It was a little plain but absolutely yummy--tasted very homemade and I would order again. I also had the bruschetta with feta cheese, also good. (See pics). We original ordered the bruschetta with a basil pesto sauce and the manager came over to tell us they were out of pesto. She apologized and even though we still had the bruschetta, just swapped out for a different sauce, she took the appetizer off our bill completely.  I've also tried the pesto chicken pizza on their super thin crust and a pepperoni pizza on regular crust. Really, really good. Although, I wouldn't go for the super thin crust, it was actually too thin.  The service is fast and everyone is also super nice.   This is my fourth FOX restaurant and I love all of them."}
{"text":"A great place for midday healthy food, thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula), salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines. It is not an average American food eatery, it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch."}
{"text":"Love the gluten free pizza crust. its delicious. the salads are decent too but the chicken is kind of like a canned chicken in texture. Sometimes when I need a box for leftovers it's hard to find someone to bring one because there's no assigned waitstaff for each table. You order the food up front then sit down with a number and the food is delivered. They ask for a tip when you pay for your food but that's before the food is delivered. I'm not a fan of tipping before I receive any services. My 4 year old is obsessed with this place and I think its more because of the atmosphere/ambiance than the food. We go here at least once every couple of weeks and have yet to really be disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"Bad food.  Meat on my beef sandwich was stringy, tough, and greasy.  My daughter loves macaroni and cheese, and wouldn't even eat it.  Gross."}
{"text":"Sauce is a home run. I found this location on Yelp years ago and I've been coming ever since.   The pizza is solid, the combinations are unique and delicious. The pasta is great, I love the mac and cheese for sure. The salads are fresh and awesome, I love the veggie salad with chicken - it's so good! The paninis are also a great option if you want a sandwich. The cookies are a must as well, I love the chocolate chunk.  This is a fast casual place but the quality is elevated and the service is usually really good. The support staff seem to take pride in what they're doing and it's cool to see the cooks working on your food as you wait.  Keep it saucy!"}
{"text":"I expected this to be a nice sit down place, but it was more or less fast Italian food. I ordered the small pasta and meatballs only to find out there was only ONE meatball..that kinda sucks. The one meatball wasn't that good anyway so maybe it was for the best. It came with free bread that is hard as a rock. When you order take out they give you a free drink while you're waiting. I didn't wait long, under 10 minutes. There was nothing too terrible about the pasta, but it was nothing special. I probably could've made it better though. I should've gone to Olive Garden across the street."}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night. Salad and two pizzas, Beet, goat cheese and quinoa salad, fig and prosciutto, mozzarella, fontina and basil Pizzas. All were very bland. The Prosciutto was sliced thick more like ham. I would put this place a step below Dominos or Papa Johns.  With so many other great Pizza places here in Phoenix, e.g.: Parlor, Pomo, Cibo, Federal why even bother with sub mediocrity?"}
{"text":"So you have to appreciate a good customer service experience. A few weeks ago Sauce changed their noodles in their cheese chicken broccoli dish. When I got home I saw this and thought they just ran out of shells. However they were dry, there wasn't enough cheese sauce to cover all the noodles and it was just blah. Well I stopped in tonight ordered the same thing and I talked the noodles with the manager. She confirmed the switch and said the dryness should not of happened. She promised they would be cheesy tonight and also comped my Stella for me while I wait.   Thank you for great customer service."}
{"text":"It's the chipotle of pizza places. Quick, good but a little on the pricey side of things. It's no Grimaldis or Spinatos but for lunch it's pretty darn good. I'm a fan of salads so the Chicken, gorgonzola and pine nuts is always a nice change up in the week. The Paninis are also tasty and nicely size and the pizza - like I said pricey but good. I like thin crust - that's probably the biggest thing. Fresh, light and not too much for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch and had the spagetti and meatballs side with a Chicken, spinich, apple, pecan and gorganzola salad. After having Rigatonies spaghetti and meatballs the night before, I was a bit disappointed in Sauce's rendition of this classic dish. The sauce on it tasted canned, almost Chef Boy ar di ish. The meatball was ok but not very flavorfull. I had to add alot of dried pepper, black pepper, and parm to spruce it up a bit. I will say that their sourdough rolls are very good here although I am not sure why they even bother to ask if you would like one. Who the hell is going to turn down a roll with butter?!? They should just automatically give you the dang thing. Haha. As for the salad, I really wasnt impressed with it either. Was kinda dry and bland. The chicken in it was good though. Don't get me wrong, I do like Sauce, however, I will just stick with the pizza's from here on out..."}
{"text":"Usually have a good meal here.  Occasionally, the pizza is burned on the edges, but we love the Caesar salad, and the bruschetta is good, too.  The service is generally timely.  Definitely will frequent again."}
{"text":"We originally went here because a friend gave us a gift card for our anniversary. We were not disappointed. It's comparable to the famous Pizzeria Bianco, but better... because you don't have to wait 4 hours and you can order take out. The pizza is crisp and light. When you finish eating it you don't have to collapse on your couch and take a nap. The sausage and caramelized onion pizza is amazingly savory and to DIE FOR. My kids always get the pepperoni but I really enjoy the rosemary potato. I know it seems like an odd combination but it's delish (ask them to go light on the olive tapenade, though, unless you really love olives). The spicy chicken sausage pizza and cookies are also tasty.   The pizza is extraordinary and will make you feel like you are ordering a $30 pizza, but the prices are super reasonable at about $10 per pizza. I HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"sauce has been my go-to favorite spot since 2006. i mostly order the same thing- chicken pine nut gorgonzola salad because it's incredible, but i've also had many other options on the menu and i always love everything i get."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best pizza I have had in awhile I would recommend if you are in the area shopping."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect coming to a pizza place that has gotten rave reviews from people in Arizona. I didn't know what would come of a chain pizza restaurant. Was it going to satisfy my East Coast palette? Or was I going to be left to wallow in an endless craving for the perfect slice, set off once again by sub-par sauce, thick and chewy crusts, and a goop of who- knows- what- kind- of- over- processed- cheese beginning to line my arteries.   This is a different kind of pizza. This is not the \"peasant pizza\" I am used to liking. This is also not the gourmet type you would find at Pizza Picasso. This is a kind of hybrid brand.   Unlike the Prius I rented on my most recent trip to New York, I liked it.   The sauce was tangy and ubiquitous. The cheese was light and tasty. Most of all the crust impressed me with its slightly sweet taste, perfectly complimenting the sauce and cheese combination.   I also ordered a bowl of the soup of the day, which was tomato. Tasty.   I'll be back, but not when I'm craving a NY slice. When I'm feeling a little fancy, I'll be back at Sauce."}
{"text":"Always a great meal! Winter vegetable salad is my favorite! All the best veggies this time of year! Butternut squash, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts! I usually add chicken and it's enough for two meals!"}
{"text":"I genuinely like this place for a few reasons, and I keep coming back despite some small shortcomings, so it must be pretty good.  My good friend and I love to go here for our catch-up sessions over some lunch.  Its great because its easy, quick, something different than the norm.  Anyone I know I can take here for lunch or dinner run, and they'll probably find something they like or want to try.  The menu is pretty simple: pizzas, paninis, pastas and salads, and all are pretty good.  I will say, however, that sometimes they sound better than they actually are.  Some of the salads can be pretty bland, but the pizza and paninis are pretty good, just not fantastic.  All in all, the food selections are great; can't really say there is a bad choice in the bunch.  One thing I can say, I have a tendency to get the same thing often, and every so often a salad or panini will be notably less-than-stellar.  Despite the risk of get a bit of bad luck when ordering, on average, the food is very good.    The service is great considering it looks like a simple order and sit-down kind of place, where there are small extras that they provide, like people coming around and asking if they can fill your drink, or offering to clear your table, etc.  As well, the location is great (especially if you get lucky enough to catch a parking space in front of the restaurant, and the convenience is fantastic."}
{"text":"Sauce has to be one of our favorites.  Great salads maybe a bit speedy but dependable always getting the same quality and service.  A great option for take home after a long work day.  We always love when they are offering the $20 special."}
{"text":"I worked right around the corner from this place for over a year and didn't try it until my last week in Scottsdale. I made it a point to make it before I left mostly just because its a FRC and I love all the other ones. Not sure why I didn't make it before.   Went for lunch with two friends. Jags and I ordered two different pizzas that we both wanted to try and then split each of them down the middle. Evan got another pizza and traded us each out a piece so we all got to try three different pizzas.   I got a pepperoni and basil. Jags got spicy chicken sausage, and Evan got something else, can't remember. Anyway, they were all pretty solid. I like the crust, they definitely do the brick oven thing. The sauce as you might guess is good as well. You can tell they use high quality ingredients.   Those three pizzas were the only things I ever tried but I'm guessing their other stuff wouldn't disappoint. They move pretty quick in there too."}
{"text":"The menu, presentation and service were all simple.  Elegantly simple not frustrating simple.  The pizza (especially the sauce) was above average.  The wine and beer selection was simple yet not familiar.  The service was great.  Seated and served quickly even with a busy Saturday night crowd.  The salad presentation looked good and suspect anything on the menu would be worth eating.   I definitely have to say I was impressed.  I expected some snobby venue with mediocre food and pretentious attitude.  Instead I found great food, reasonable prices and almost fast food like quick, but five star like attention service.  Definitely hope one makes it to the East side in near future Gilbert or Queen Creek.  Yelp makes a great recommendation yet again!"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere seem fine, but lack of pigeon control is extremely alarming. Watched half a dozen pigeons today devour a customer's plate after they left. Pigeon carry many diseases, and the contact that they have the plates and utensils is a pathogen health risk. Waiters did not seem concerned and were slow to collect plates. My wife had a bad stomach ache later that night that may or may not be attributed to food born illness. I was disappointed with the chain's lack of high standards and may not eat there again. Also their back of the house seemed messy and sanitation buckets where on top of the food preparation tables, another cross contamination risk between floor and food prep surface."}
{"text":"The world-champion of the Caesar-salad pizza.  Never found anything like it in my world travels. Highly recommended!  I think it's like $12, comes in one size, a cheesy flat bread with tasty Caesar salad.  Weird? Just try it! I am a believer!"}
{"text":"Sauce is a must! It's my go-to for a great salad, my kids love the pizza and the staff is always warm and welcoming. I enjoy the ambiance inside or on the patio, whether I'm having lunch with a friend or a date night with my husband."}
{"text":"Sauce -  Well enuf said .. no it's not that I didn't like it , it was ...fine .Just not exciting  not wow this is sooo good, just fine.  I wanted Lasagna . I had Lasagna. It tasted like great frozen food you get at Costco.  But  would  I want some of this restaurant's Lasagna   again   , don't know , don't care.   I wish I had been more impressed. A good friend of mine loves Sauce, I want to say to lots of  my friends , \" Hey there is the great new place up at the new place on Happy Valley \"   But I am not going to because I  rather eat some where that knocks my socks off.   The atmosphere was clean . crisp ,  beautiful  brick oven glowing . Lots of modern but Homey decor.   I really want to love it."}
{"text":"I love Sauce pretty much anything you get here is going to be good. I was disappointed though because we ordered out and they put blue cheese instead of Gorgonzola on the salad but that's not that big of deal."}
{"text":"This location is a bit of a hike from mi casa, but it's worth the drive. In general, I think Sauce is a little pricey for lunch but the price point is perfect for dinner.  I usually get the thin crust pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onion and peppers and tell them to hold the mushrooms. The meatball panini is an excellent choice as well. Last time my wife got the Bruschetta which she thought was fabulous. I saw another patron scarfing down the Spaghetti and meatballs, so that's the next item on the menu I'm going to try.   I love the casual atmoshere where you can kick back and relax and have a mellow conversation. There's plenty of seating and the parking is plentiful in the evening since the coffee shop next door closes before dinner."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered a Meatball Panini Sandwich and a small drink. The cashier handed me my table number while I was trying to cope with sticker shock. Any lunch that costs $11.20 better be a kick-ass, take no prisoners bountiful gastronomical feast.  Although the sandwich tasted good, I felt like I was served a child's portion. I asked myself........Where's the Beef?, certaintly not at Sauce. I will not return since I feel that their sandwich prices should be at least a 1/3 lower given how puny they are; not worth the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Sauce for quite a while and its consistently good. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience because I always know what to expect.  The pizza is good, salads are solid, and the mac n' cheese...well, lets just say I'm a sucker it. Every time we come to eat here the service is friendly and helpful, probably the best I've had from a \"fast casual\" type of restaurant.  I definitely recommend sauce if you're looking for something fairly quick but delivers on quality."}
{"text":"Quick lunch get the smaller portions the big portions are a lot of food. Nice bread sticks and the place is really clean and really fast. It is almost like a to go restaurant with table service."}
{"text":"Great food, service and loved the decor of this location!  The prices are going to hurt Postino's. You can get comparable food for a fraction of the cost, you just have to order at the counter.   I had soup and bruschetta and everything was delicious. The white bean soup was super  flavorful and fresh, not out of a can!   Bruschetta had a generous amount of mozzarella along with sweet tomatoes, basil and balsamic drizzle."}
{"text":"This little restaurant offers gourmet pizzas, salads, pannis and wine in a casual atmosphere. As customary, my wife and daughter all ate family style and ordered the suggested Chicken, Pine Nuts, Tomato & Gorgonzola salad and Pepperoni pizza. Being from Illinois, I'm a huge fan of Monical's thin crust pizza (which my wife now loves) so all thin crust pizza's are held to this standard. The pizza was a good attempt but didn't not replace Monical's pizza as the best thin crust. It was thin (almost cracker grade) and good, but just missed the boat on best. On the salad side, I'm not much of a salad eater, but this one did have very good flavor and offered up a great variety for taste. My only real criticism is that the restaurant is trying too hard to be on the high end of the yuppie scale with high prices and just too much arrogance from the staff. They were different in the sense that I felt the \"you are lucky to be served her\", however, when we asked for suggestions, the manager jumped in and made some very good, en-lighted and friendly suggestions that saved the day."}
{"text":"Pitiful...please see my photo of my bruschetta. The picture doesnt really show the end pieces, well imagine just bread and no topping on the rest of piece. Quality definitely has gone down hill since RA purchased Sauce. I use to use Sauce for catering all the time, I will not use them now because they are skimping on portions."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!!! They were busy and patient not much else service wise as we had to get our own drinks but the staff was busy cleaning and making sure theu kept busy."}
{"text":"My two friends and I wanted to have lunch together, so we went to Sauce, thinking it was going to be great! The food was excellent, but the waitresses, not so much. This one waitress came up to my friends and I to collect our plates, but she never asked me if I was finished with my food, and she took it anyways. She did ask me if I wanted it boxed, but I said no thank you because I was still eating. Then she just took my plate and walked away. I was very disappointed. I did not get to finish my lunch, and left unsatisfied. LIKE WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK??? THIS RUINED MY DAY  :((((  UGHHHHHHH"}
{"text":"I recommend the chicken and pine nut salad.  The dressing is perfect.  Their pizza crust is thin but perfectly toasted.  Great service, very friendly and they serve vino!  Can't beat that, cheers!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! The spicy chicken pasta is delicious! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"If I were to name this restaurant with only one word, it would be...BLAH. Everything was...just there. When you burp after you eat at Sauce, it doesn't even have a flavor. It is THAT bland.  I wasted 45 minutes and $44 that I will never get back again on this sorry excuse of an eatery."}
{"text":"What happened to sauce?!!! We ordered to go tonight and it was SO disappointing. They used to have my favorite pizza and now, I don't think I'd order again. Previously they had the most delicious finely ground sausage, now it is sliced and disgusting. The turkey and feta salad had zero avocado (which is the best part).  The toppings in the pizza were sparse and the gluten free crust left A LOT to be desired. Lots of places have great gluten free crust! This was hard and chewy. Oh sigh...so sad to see the changes and downhill turn.  Ps... they only offer kalamata olives??? Who doesn't offer black olives for pizza!?"}
{"text":"Been here many times in the past and Happy to see the consistency is continuing. We ordered bruchetta and a kids pizza, both were delicious. I was a little confused because typically bruchetta is on a thinner French slice but this was on a thick slice of French bread. Still delicious! So friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a small group after trying to find something we would all like in the area. Who doesn't love pizza?!  The food was great and they have an awesome selection of wine. We tried the Pesto Chicken and Suprema and they did not disappoint. The pesto was fresh and delicious, the chicken was cooked well and the cheese was great.  The pizzas at Sauce are very crispy, and the crust is rather thin, so if you are looking for a thick, heavy NY-style pizza, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Was here tonight because Sharon H. wanted some pizza and this was a convenient spot to meet up that we both were interested to try. While walking in i realized this wasn't what i had envisioned it was worth a shot. When you walk in you get a feel very similar to say a Pei Wei where it has that borderline fast food feel but with the made to order mix.  We ordered a caprese salad and a prosciutto and melon pizza. We also got a drink and selected the passion iced tea which was very good. The salad came first and was very good with nice flavoring and good proportioning of the salad/tomato/crustini/mozzarella was excellent to get a bit of each with every bite. It was however lacking in the basil department as it was barely noticable if at all, if that was there this would have been amazing.  As for the pizza it was not what I was expecting at all. It had no sauce (odd for a place called sauce) and the crust was more like a cracker than standard thin crust which is denser and less crisp. This was more along the lines of a crisp tortilla/tostada with cheese. It was topped with prosciutto and melon (honeydew and cantaloupe).  While not what i was expecting that flavor was very good and the ingredients were good. The slicing of the melon made it easy to bite and also prevented it from being overly juicy but without sacrificing taste. The presentation was nice as well with the melon being shaped like a flower over the top of the pizza (see the pic i uploaded).  Pizza wasn't what i was crazing as it wasn't a true pizza and probably more of a lunch/appitizer style pizza than dinner but it was good. The salad was the star of the meal. Overall solid meal."}
{"text":"Good food. Good music. Good atmosphere. Good vibes. One of my favorite places to eat in the Mesa/Gilbert area."}
{"text":"Usually love Sauce and go there often, but my wife and son both got horrible food poisoning from the chicken yesterday. Not sure if this is due to the new location, new ownership, or just a fluke. Things happen, but they got very sick from this experience."}
{"text":"The managers at this location were very nice and had great customer service, especially Casey"}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars because of the staff's attentiveness and the degree of customer service they demonstrated at our last visit. There were two people at the register. I'll call them guy 1 and guy 2. Guy 1 was taking our order. When we ordered I asked if they had some sort of juice for our toddler. I saw guy 2 whisper something to guy 1. I didn't think anything of it. Guy 1 said they have milk, and because my toddler somehow hates milk this week I said it's ok, no drink for her. Then they told us they can get apple juice. So we ordered apple juice. It seemed like they had to get the apple juice from somewhere because it was delivered to our table. I'm very pleased, they didn't have to do this, but I can see that they try their best to satisfy the customers. I don't think the $1 I paid for the apple juice is worth them getting it from somewhere, but it goes without saying that we really appreciated it.  As far as the food is concerned, I really like the thin crusted pizza, almost like a flatbread, so I don't feel like I'm 10 pounds heavier by the time I'm done. We also ordered a small bowl of pasta with meatballs, it could've used a bit more flavor and seasoning. But overall, very pleased with this experience (third time at this location)."}
{"text":"Good food and service.. Only drawback is they need more space! Lines get a little long so be prepared.."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza and salads.  Plenty of options from which to choose.  Lots of pizza competition in this part of town but, nonetheless, a welcome addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is a great place with a very laid back feel. The staff is great, the seating is not a problem here either."}
{"text":"I debated about going in when one of the employees / manager came out gave us a menu and said think about as we were off to another place.  We carefully looked over the menu and decided to take a chance and couldn't be happier with our decision.  We order 2 different type of pizza's and loved it.  It is on our to go list now of place and we hope to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This place went from being great to poor customer service and mixing up all orders. Avoid."}
{"text":"Sauce is my kind of place.  Great, inexpensive food, casual yet trendy atmosphere, perfect location.    Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront, I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.  I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each, drizzled in balsamic), and the artichoke and portabella pizza.  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.    If youre feeling particularly saucey, you can have yourself a glass of wine as well."}
{"text":"This place is the welcome anomaly in the Fox family.  Not nearly as pretentious as its culinary siblings, and a huge step up from its QSR competition.  The chicken pine nut salad accompanied by the sausage caramelized onion pizza is about the best possible dinner one can buy for under $20.    This place is the perfect place for a quick, tasty, and inexpensive meal on an average Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Everyone is great and friendly. Sevice is fast and they make sure you are pleased and even refill your fountain drink.  I love there Chicken C. Salad pizza... It's the best, well anything you order is delicious and the patio is a great plus."}
{"text":"Such a good place. Cheap and quick! A good casual dining option for the area. All of the salads are AMAZING. My favorites: kale and salmon salad and lasagna pizza"}
{"text":"Reason behind why I chose two stars is simply because the food is amazing, but the service I received was awful. I was served by a young, thin girl with long curly brown hair. She was extremely monotone, had awful body language, and was very judgmental. I asked to add on another plate to my order and she literally sighed and rolled her eyes. Never returning to this location again."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed in this place.  Now that it's summer, they have a $20 summer special where you get a salad, pizza, and two glasses of wine...perfect for a dinner date :)  I love their turkey feta salad, and you can ask to substitute the lettuce for spinach which is even more amazing!  We tried the chicken pesto pizza for the first time, and wasn't disappointed at all.  I always love stopping by for a nice casual dinner...there's so much to choose from!"}
{"text":"I've started to consider myself a regular at Sauce. Ever since this location opened down the street from my house, I can't stop going! If you're looking for pizza, pasta, salad, or a sandwich, you have to check this place out. The environment is friendly and very welcoming. Staff is also super great at waiting on you. This is a great place for lunch or a casual dinner. I'd also recommend it as a good \"first date\" spot. The portions are a good size for the amount of money you pay! A cool thing they have available is the wine on tap. Who doesn't like a good glass of wine with their Italian food? You also have to make sure to grab a homemade cookie at the register! Whether you're looking for a good sit down meal or a quick to-go order, this is a place you've got to try."}
{"text":"This place has been packed for dinner since it opened a few weeks ago. We had pizza this time while pizza is thin and crispy and pretty good it is over priced for what it is they do not look like their picture's with pile's of stuff on them, they are mainly flat and chinsey w the topping's. Who know's maybe you would have to add lot's of topping's to get it tasty so a make it yourself personal $8.50 12\" pizza turn's into $11. I'd rather go to Ray's accross the street personally. The beer and wine selection is not too bad. I will probably eat here again but not for the pizza. The kid loved the mac & cheese $4 incl. drink is ok by me."}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of thin crust pizzas, but this place actually manages to make them taste good.  The dining environment is casual, and service was average but speedy.... it is basically an upscale fast food joint.   Not for every occasion, but all-in-all a nice place to grab a quick bite.  Added bonus, they serve wine and euro-style fizzy drinks (in orange and lemon flavors)."}
{"text":"Used to love sauce so much it was always my go to but I hadn't been in while but ordered my favorites today- grilled cheese and tomato soup and mac and cheese. But I sadly discovered both had been changed and are pretty terrible now. Why mess with something so good? The mac and cheese is like a sad buttered pasta and the grilled cheese used to be so crisp and now is a sad bun with cheese. I am very disappointed in these changes and unless they change back I will not be returning to sauce."}
{"text":"Sauce is one of the fast-casual dining concept that seems to have sprouted in AZ -- from breakfast (Scramble) to Chinese (Pei Wei). You line up, order your grub, and the staff brings the food to your table. Not a fast food, the menu items are prepared daily. This is my go-to place when I need quick dinner without the delay of being waited at Grimaldi's or other pizza place.   WHY GO THERE? Salad, thin-crust pizza, beer or wine.   WHATCHAGOT? I've tried all salad but always go back for the chicken, spinach and apple salad. I like having protein without the guilt of fried chicken. Pepperoni pizza with crimini mushroom is good. I'm curious to try prosciutto and melon.  YOU GOT SERVED. Service is prompt and informal. Nothing to jump about, but nothing to frown either.   Overall, good value when you want a quick bite."}
{"text":"After ordering my Kale Salmon salad and sitting on the bench for 25 min, still nothing. The person I was waiting with had already received their food, several people that were behind me whom ordered pizza's had already received their food and left. When I asked again about my salad they said they were still making it since they were trying to figure out what to do since they ran out of salmon again. They decided to give me chicken...UM...Were you going to ask the customer if that was okay? What if I didn't like chicken or had an allergy? The guy says, oh oops they haven't talked to you yet...UM no. Finally 10 min later I get a salad with chicken. It's missing half the ingredients this salad comes with. All that's in here is romaine lettuce, some kale and chicken and the dressing. Missing the farro, currants and cashews. At least they gave me $3 back for the cost of the salmon, but at this point they should have just refunded me for the 40 min it took to get a salad and not even what I ordered. Maybe take a look at your inventory and start ordering salmon if you run out often? Just a thought."}
{"text":"Sauce rules. I have been to this loc specifically, a dozen times probably. It's always a good experience. The food is fresh and you usually don't wait long. Best items on the menu: Rosemary Potato and Basil pizza, Mac n Cheese and Caprese Salad. I also really love the Brushetta apps, can't go wrong there. The staff is always polite and friendly. Very reasonable pricing for what you get. One of my favorite lunch/dinner spots in the area!"}
{"text":"one of my very favorite restaurants! the staff is so friendly and knows my name and order. (don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing). they always ask me questions and make me feel comfortable and welcomed. not to mention the food is great and they're super quick!"}
{"text":"One of the few placed that exceeds expectations time and again.  Just try the salad and you'll probably be impressed like me.  I usually get a sandwich and salad combo but the pizzas are good too.  Great value and good food."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a cup of soup and nice salad with my wife.  Good food and service at reasonable prices. Good for families or a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Solid, simple place.  Order at the counter, grab a number, have a seat and get your meal delivered when ready.  It's quite attractive inside, with a pretty patio and lots of room.  Nice staff, but spotty take-out (if they're at all busy, it can take ages).    They serve tasty gourmet little pizzas with interesting ingredients (although sometimes a little dry - depends on what you like), salads, pasta and paninis.  We've only tried the pizzas and salads.  The Rosemary Potato, Mozzarella-Fontina-Basil and Wild Mushroom pies are all taste-tested and approved.  The classic ceaser salad is just what you'd expect.  It's a nicer, healthier alternative to other pizza places in the area.  However, with all of the amazing pizza in Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe, this is only a place I'd visit when I'm in the neighborhood.    For the area, 4 stars, but if it were in a neighborhood with better restaurants, I'd only give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing service! The food was Incredible! Had the pizza and the chicken broccoli pasta"}
{"text":"Have picked up orders here 3-4 times as a food courier, sometimes it was very busy, other times not so busy, but in every case the wait times were reasonable, employees were attentive and friendly, and they seemed to care whether my order was right and kept me updated if there was going to be a wait. Thanks."}
{"text":"This place is good for kids and groups. Recommend the thin crust! It is super thin, which I really liked. The edges are crispy but the middle was soft and floppy from the sauce and toppings. Also, with the thin crust, you get less full off the crust so you have room for more pizza. :P For 5 people and a toddler, we ordered the roasted vegetable salad, the quinoa beet arugula salad, the mozzarella fontina basil pizza, the lasagna pie pizza, the suprema pizza, the red sauce and mozzarella pasta, and a cup of soup (for my mom). It was just enough food with a little room to spare for dessert (which we got down the street at Snoh, but the gelato here sounded good too!).  Also came with focaccia rolls, which I didn't have room for and also didn't really care to eat because I was already getting enough carbs from the pizza. My favorite was the lasagna pizza, which was super garlic-y, but my brother's fave was the suprema. The pasta was also surprisingly good for being so plain. Would def come back!"}
{"text":"Don't know what the food is like but the employees are kind of rude. We walked in right around closing time and there were at least 20-30 people in the restaurant. We stood at the door for a few minutes then someone yelled across the room \"We're closed. We open at 11 tomorrow.\"   Haha. Great. That's real helpful when we are hungry right now. Your food isn't something we neeeeeeed so badly that we'll be back at 11 am. It's something we were settling for bc we were close & your dining room looked busy enough that maybe the food wouldn't be bad. But I guess I'll never know.   I also didn't realize it was a Fox restaurant. I don't know what the hype is about w those but I've been to others & wasn't impressed. Now sold to the owner of RA? Lol. Please see my review of RA at Kierland to understand why that makes it even less likely that I'll ever know what Sauce is all about."}
{"text":"This is one our families go to quick casual spots for lunch or dinner. Nothing fussy, just good food that comes pretty quick.  It's a walk up, order, seat yourself kinda place.  Always busy but magically there is always somewhere to sit too."}
{"text":"I love this place! This is my go-to place in the neighborhood for delicious, quick, and affordable food. There are many vegetarian and gluten-free options. I love it that I can bring almost friends and acquantainces to Sauce, and they can both eat the food and find it to be delicious. My favs are the Mac & Cheese and the Caprese salad. Yum!"}
{"text":"In the past two weeks, my wife and I have been to this location twice. Both times, we ordered the exact same thing...because it was absolutely delicious!  For our appetizer, we opted for the Caprese Bruschetta. It's topped with mozzarella cheese, and it's perfect for sharing. If I'm not mistaken, it comes in a serving of either 2.5 or 3 pieces.  For our pizza, we decided we would split the Portobello & Artichoke Pizza. It's a thin crust style of pizza topped with...nevermind. You know what's on it.  Again, this pizza was perfect for us to split.  Sauce has a great modern vibe going on inside. It's kind of trendy, mixed with a little hipster. So, it should appeal to many different groups. On our first trip, we sat inside. It was nice to see how the staff were so involved in the entire process. Even though it's not a \"wait service\" type of place, the staff didn't seem to know that. They were constantly policing the dining room, making sure every table was spic and span for the next group that would inevitably be coming in. While doing so, they were also very diligent in making sure that the clientele were being cared for.  On our second outing, we managed to find space on the patio. Each table outside of the natural shadow created by the building's overhang has an umbrella. Though, there are no misters that I saw. Thankfully, we managed to find a couple of tables under the overhang. Therefore it was nice and shaded. As for the rest of the seats, they might be better suited for the cooler months, or in the evening.   For both of us to share an appetizer and a pizza, plus two refillable fountain drinks, we managed to pay around $20. Not bad for such good food and service!"}
{"text":"I'm a pizza guy so this post is strictly on the pizza. My wife and I love this place. We go there probably every month if not a few times a month. I have had every pizza there and my favorite is with the sausage and pepperoni. The atmosphere is great and the waiters/waitresses are always, always kind and respectful. We went in one time and when they brought out our pizza the waiter (before he placed my pizza down) said, \"We are so sorry we made the wrong pizza for you, we have started the other pizza currently as we speak for you but we wanted to give you this one so you wouldn't go hungry.\" Now that is some customer service right there. Sauce is my go to place for pizza now over any other place (yes even Papa J's). I would absolutely recommend going to sauce and getting there sausage and pepperoni and/or spicy chicken sausage. Not a fan of the rosemary potato pizza or their gluten free pizza (that taste like... the usual gluten free nasty)"}
{"text":"My first visit was pleasant. The pizza was delicious and a wonderful thin crust with a fired oven. The Mac and cheese was nothing to write home about though. I like that they also have Sobe Lean as a drink choice. The staff was friendly and it was nice to be called sir."}
{"text":"These are by far the best salads ! Ingredients are so fresh and tasty. The portobello and artichoke Pizza was so flavorful and delightful will definitely be a regular"}
{"text":"The really thin crust pizza at Sauce is the best in town. The gluten free version is the reason for the missing star. Good, but for me the gf pie at Streets of New York or Spinatos is much better."}
{"text":"Always fresh, this location seems to serve up better quality food than the others. Part of Fox Restaurant Concepts, Sauce is the mostly salads, sandwiches and pizzas, so it makes a great lunch spot. They serve beer and wine and also have a couple desserts, so they make a good dinner option as well."}
{"text":"If you got a craving for pizza and don't want to feel too guilty about eating it, this always seems to satiate that fix. The pizzas here are ultra thin and there are many varieties available. Bryan and I always get 2 pizzas because we would still be hungry if we just order one without an appetizer and we can always take the extra home. Today we ate the pepperoni and mushroom pizza and the potato and feta cheese pizza with olive tempanade. Both were yummy in their own way! We ate the tomato, mozzarella, and pesto bruschetta as an appetizer which came out unbelievably quick while waiting for our pizzas. Sauce's pizzas are unique in their own right that I crave when I want something lighter than regular hand tossed pizzas yet don't want to spend as much for gourmet pizzas. It's a comfortable yet yummy in-between compromise!"}
{"text":"As always it depends on what you're looking for in a pizza and individual opinion.  I am all for gourmet anything, and I love pizza, so I will leave it at that.  If I was basing a review on appearance only than I would give it four stars because its clean and inviting.  The pizza's are on the smaller side and the crust is cracker like in texture and appearance which means the pizza cools off quickly, so if you're doing take out you may be eating cold pizza or reheating it at home.  I wouldn't personally call Sauce gourmet as much as trendy.  The pizza is alright but pricey for the portion you get.  Overall the place is clean and decent quality."}
{"text":"The good: Great service, friendly staff Tasty, well cooked pizza crust, sauce & ingredients Good variety of pizza toppings Delish salad  The bad: Skimpy on the pizza toppings  I got a no-cheese pizza with red pizza sauce, basil, broccoli, crimini mushrooms & tomato. The pizza was cooked well and the crust was crunch, crispy & tasty, they've got it down! Topping were definitely skimpy though. When someone orders a no cheese pizza, you gotta hook up the toppings! I wound up combining toppings from 3 different slices on to 1 just to get enough coverage.  My wife got a chopped salad with a delicious vinagrette dressing that she really enjoyed.  Vegans should avoid the red pasta sauce and the tomato soup, as they both include cream. The red pizza sauce & crust is vegan."}
{"text":"this may be one of the more boring reviews I write because it's late and I just wrote a paper for class. The first time I ate at sauce it was HORRIBLE. i was trying to be all healthy and order this cherry goat cheese salad, which basically killed me.  Goat cheese is not meant for those who have been vegan for a year!    It's always nice to unwind with friends, even though they weren't all my direct friends, it was nice to be around people that didn't judge me.  It took away from the watery wine I was drinking.  My best man and I enjoyed a broccoli chicken pizza, and like usual it was good.  The chicken wasn't too dry and the crust didn't make it hard to enjoy the toppings.  Our friends had more trouble liking their food.  I suppose the shells and mozzerella were a bit dry...the woman who was eating it though is very picky...so it may have just as well been delicious.   This is also the same woman that thought Mac-n-Cheese was a sandwich -_- anyways I enjoyed my food, and you will too.  The mood of the place is very relaxed.  you get your own refills of soda and tea, but the waiters are more than happy to get it for you.   Since Ronald, my new yelp partner in crime went with me..I await his review.  Welcome to the team!  And I'm not raggin' on the pic that they suggest for this location and review...but what is that?! I mean seriously that isn't going to make people go there..."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the scottsdale location of Sauce a million times and I love it, so I decided to grab my favorites to-go from this location since I was in the neighborhood. I got my usual, roasted vegetable salad, and an order of bruschetta. The bruschetta was fine, but my salad was pretty bad. The brussels sprouts are always my favorite part and for some reason they just threw in a bunch of malformed pieces and stems, no actual edible sprouts. (See pic) They were as hard a a rock and not even chewable. Ruined the salad as I had to pick through to avoid eating these. Won't be back to this location probably."}
{"text":"5 star review for the manager. Justin I believe his name is. The absolute king. Every time I go there he is super nice, runs the show down there how a manager should. I have seen him do everything . He doesn't care. I see him on the register ringing people up. Or even in the back whipping up a delicious meal. If I ever had a restaurant I would want this guy. This probably sounds like I'm his relative or something but I swear, I'm just a customer of this place. I just hope their taking care of him in the cash dept cause he deserves it.   Oh the food is also very very good. Quick, friendly staff. No punks which is hard to find. The best. It's my Saturday spot."}
{"text":"The salad was half put together, I ordered the spinach chicken salad with glazed walnuts.  The walnuts were left out, the chicken was just thrown in in clumps.  Not impressed at all! Will not come back ever!"}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of Sauce and I'm not lowering any stars, but I will say that the changes they have made to the Caprese Salad are not so much to my liking. It used to be my favorite salad and I would crave it. However, I've now had the new version of the Caprese Salad and it's just not like it was. The mozzarella overtakes the salad and the croutons (while tasty) are too fatty for the salad. Mozzarella is definitely the most overpowering ingredient and there aren't a ton of tomatoes. It's still tastes ok, but it's not the same. So, I will continue to hope they bring the old one back!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Arizona, I wanted to try new establishments I couldn't find back east. My friend who lives in South Scottsdale brought me here, and I'm italian, so I was excited. For being named \"Sauce\" its sauce wasn't too great. I ordered the caesar and spaghetti and meatballs. It was OK but nothing to rave about. I wouldn't recommend it, and I havent been back, but for italian and good sauces, I would prob go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long time and it was really good. The meatballs are my favorite and the customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"I work right by this location and I've always been pleased with the service. But today I called to order lunch, on my very short lunch break. They asked me to hold briefly and I agreed. After 5 minutes (no exaggeration, I checked the call time on my phone) they finally picked the phone back up. Even then I was still patient and ready to order. So I tell them again that I'll be placing an order for pick up, and they ask me to hold again. So I let them know I had already waited 5 minutes to order, and he still pushed to have me hold AGAIN. When I only have 30 minutes for lunch and I'll still have to wait another 10-15 for them to make my food, I don't have time to hold over and over. Needless to say, I've crossed them off of the list of places for lunch in the area."}
{"text":"So YUMMY!!!!! The bruschetta is excellent . And the services is awesome!! We love to stop here after a movie to chat and get a drink."}
{"text":"For a good cause.. that's what I kept telling myself when we pulled up to Sauce at the canal (Waterfront, puhlease!). Me and the Mr headed over to Sauce after our reservation for Digestif fell through (thanks guys!). We were very animate about supporting the Dining for Life cause so this was the next best thing.. well, maybe those are a poor choice of words. The thing is we didn't want to drive all the way to downtown Phoenix.. so since there were only a handful of places..   Anyway, I have never been a fan of Fox concepts.. mediocre food set into sort of cool spaces. Sauce is no different.. sort of cool industrial interior, down beat music and wine only 5 bucks a glass. The concept is great its just that the food is terrible on all levels. From the salad with next to no toppings.. to the shitty Totino's style pizza (yep, ate that shit when I was a kid) to the horrible pannini. Seriously.. the food is so simple you think it would be great.. its just doesn't work.. I think the ingredients are to scant and the quality is so so.   I gave one star for the lasagna which didn't suck as bad as I thought and the staff.. the staff is very friendly and attentive. Now if the food was better, well, I think we'd have a winner."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the food or service at Sauce. Stopped in for lunch and had the mac & cheese and it was great like always. I know I will certainly be back again soon since I now work in the area."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good ....  They have Ruffino Chianti -yes, that earns them a star right off the bat . They also have Gluten free options.   I had a salad ( they have a few choices and most have corn in them )The only corn free salad unfortunately had chicken. My veggie salad was decent (wish it was corn free).. Everyone else had pizza, and they really enjoyed the sausage, and carmelized onion pie.  The service was good, and relatively fast .  The not so great .. Way too noisy ,and the chairs were annoying, zero ambiance, i found the atmosphere lacking warmth.  Bottom line....it is a decent option for a quick bite, in my opinion ."}
{"text":"Everyone was very nice service was good food was delicious I had minestrone and a salad my guy had minestrone as well and a sandwich we both enjoyed it we will return and recommend"}
{"text":"I really like this place despite it being a chain. Their pizza is pretty predictable and good. After ordering from here, I realized a pizza is too big for just me. Next time, I'll split a yummy salad and pizza with my little. I love how quick the service is. We ordered a meat lovers pizza, a kids pizza and added sausage, and I made my own on hand tossed (or there's thin crust or gluten free)with chicken sausage, olives, and artichokes. All fresh, all tasty. Will continue coming back.  This is the type of pizza that doesn't leave you with that heavy, bloated feeling."}
{"text":"Went in around lunch, it was busy but I didn't have to wait very long to get my food. I got the supremo thin crust pizza. It was good, their tea was good only negative was that the sugar in the sugar packets was just a big clump like it had gotten wet. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"With so many pizza places around the valley its difficult to find uniqueness combined with quality, but this place does it on both accounts. I've sampled a lot of their menu and can honestly say the pizzas, pastas and salads are definitely more carefully crafted than other places in this price range. Great experience all the way from the food to the staff, you can tell this is a well managed restaurant. Now I just need to check out the wine!"}
{"text":"I finally tried Sauce at norterra and was pleased. Very reasonable prices. I got a pepperoni and mushroom pizza on the thin crust. Being from ny this is the only way for pIzza. It had a very thin wafer like crust that was tasty. My only preference is it was short on mushrooms. I will try it with extra cheese next time. I also think the pasta menu looks good to try."}
{"text":"Staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The quality of food for the price is great. We are officially adding this place to our regular rotation."}
{"text":"We like coming here because of the variety of items on the menu-pasta, pizza, sandwiches and salads. I have tried a few items on the menus and haven't been disappointed. Service is quick and you don't leave hungry."}
{"text":"I have loved sauce since the day it opened. That is why this four star review is so painful for me to write. I simply cannot give my once five star impression all because of what was once one of the most desired cravings amongst the people of Arizona - the Mac n' Cheese. Ever since the type of noodle used has been switched from a decadent shell to an ordinary macaroni noodle, it just isn't the same. Fortunately, the salads are still as fresh and flavorful as ever. No matter where I go, no salad is as satisfying as the roasted vegetable salad - packed with big bites of veggies and dressed to perfection - or the classic and crisp turkey and feta salad."}
{"text":"Overpriced upscale fast food. I spend my $ at better places... the food is average quality and overpriced... did I mention OVERPRICED?"}
{"text":"Go to Pizzeria Bianco! It's so much better and it's locally owned and about 15 min away also Martha Stewart's favorite place to eat. Nothing special about sauce pizza."}
{"text":"Omg the food was amazing. Had the spinach chicken apple Gorgonzola salad held the walnuts and had chicken pesto pizza. To die for.  Service amazing. We meant to order chicken Caesar pizza and they replaced it no question.   Great service great attention to our needs.  Loved it"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Sauce for over 5 years now, and the food is consistently good. I love the crisply thin-crust Pizza, my partner loves the salads. They have a variety of wines by the glass, 'reasonably' priced (relatively speaking), and they also sell Pellegrino 'Pompello' (Grapefruit), which is one of my all-time favorite sodas."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza in town. Excellent customer service! I love this place. I'm now a regular. The truffle oil arugula pizza is my favorite. They ate super fast and amazing."}
{"text":"WTF Sauce!  I just ordered a bowl of tomato soup on Postmates and this is what I get?? Where's the rest?!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Sauce, up until it was bought out from Fox Restaurant concepts as of the first of the year.  Boy, have I noticed a change in quality!  Went last night, we were craving the Mac N Cheese which previously was always the best.  Last night, after having a salad as an appetizer, our 2 bowls of $7.00 Mac N Cheese arrived.  My friend dug into his first.  I asked, is it a great as ever and all he said, was taste it and you tell me.  I dug my fork in and found that the pasta was over cooked, all stuck together and there was little cheese sauce.  I took a taste and it was awful!  I mixed up the bowl hoping it would help but there was so little cheese sauce and the macaroni noodles were so overdone, there was nothing to help this dish.  We didn't eat either of the 2 bowls we were served.  Two girls sat right next to us and ordered the exact same thing and after about 5 minutes of watching them play with their food, I asked them how it was and they both said the dish was completely off from \"normal\" and they too did not finish their respective bowls.  I don't know who took the Sauce restaurants over but come on - it's Mac N Cheese!!!  How do you mess up that dish?    I may have to revert back to making Paradise Bakery to place to go for Mac N Cheese and Grimaldis our pizza go-to and skip Sauce all together or maybe it's just the Norterra location?  Either way, please get your stuff together new ownership!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend who had been raving about their 'gourmet' pizza for months. She only knew of the one in Mesa but I stumbled upon this one while out for a ride on my bike, motor-less. Decided to take her there for a couple reasons a) cuz she's pretty cool and b) cuz if I don't like it I can totally rip on her and her tastes.  But dang! I really loved this place! So what if I'm in search of the best pizza in a city new to me? This pizza was so good I couldn't even bother comparing it to my fave 'back home.'   We split a chicken caesar salad. The dressing was tasty and I really enjoyed the pulled-style all white chicken. Then onto the pepperoni and mushroom pizza. I loved how thin and crispy it was, the pepperoni was of really exceptional quality but it literally comes down to the sauce. Yeah, it's not just a catchy name for the joint; it makes the pizza!  My only complaint would be the selection of beer. Wine is becoming more and more accessible and I can totally get on board with the idea of wine and pizza or wine and just about anything else, but sometimes I want a beer. They have maybe 6 brands of beer and some are totally appropriate, such as Peroni. I just would like to have seen a bigger selection.  And I think someone else has mentioned the fact that the restroom is very small; true. It wasn't crowded when we were there so I think I'd be pissed if I'd been drinking and it was crowded and I did need to go. Other than that, I really dig this place and can totally see myself going back for a casual dinner or even making the little trek for lunch."}
{"text":"I do enjoy Sauce. The Pizzas are great, not the best around but they are good. This place is a bit pricey for what it is but still worth it. The Panninis are great and always hit the spot. They give you actual glasses  for your soda and have to ask for a to go cup, which is kinda annoying, but thats just a small issue."}
{"text":"Great Pizza,  SUPER YUMMY Mac N Cheese!!   If you haven't tried it - you're missing out!!  The  salads are super tasty as well.  Mac N Cheese is where its at though!!"}
{"text":"I have tried to eat here more than once.  Every time, it's been a distaster.  This food is just bad. The pizza dough tastes like sawdust. The tomato sauce doesn't taste like anything that's been near a real tomato in quite some time. They even managed to make fresh mozarella slimy, tasteless, and disgusting.  Never again. I've given them enough chances."}
{"text":"This is our favorite family pizza place. Our habit is to get the Caesar salad and Margherita pizza with extra basil. This combo always rocks and goes well family style. We love how laid back this place is."}
{"text":"Love the sausage and peperoni pizza, go hand tossed"}
{"text":"It's remarkable that the sauce in a restaurant called SAUCE is so devoid of any flavor. Had the side of pasta with meatball, and the sauce was no better than the cheapest store bought brand; less flavor than ketchup. The chicken with broccoli pasta was equally disappointing. I don't know if their recipes have changed, but I both dishes used to be favorite go-tos whenever I dined at a Sauce. C'mon guys! Your sauces should be so good that I want to buy some to bring home with me. As they are now, I didn't even finish my meal."}
{"text":"I too am also a fan of other FOX concept resturaunts but Sauce was extremely disappointing. Had seen the location at the Scottsdale Water Front but never seemed enticed enough to enter until the other night. My cousin and I met up at a central location and unfortunately this seemed like the best option in the Norterra lot.  He had a pizza, which for my opinion are over-priced for their quality and size. Their menu doesn't span much taste-buds but can get any general idea of a \"classy\" pizza across. It was burnt and too crispy, even for just a plan pepperoni and cheese, it was boring.  Torn between wanting some pizza and a salad, I ordered their \"greek\"ish salad which was pretty good. Although it was delicious, the salad was way to rich to eat entirely by one's self.    I was mostly turned off by their service of wine in what appeared to be a juice cup. Maybe thats fine for my kitchen but thats at home where it doesn't cost per glass. My Mom informed me later that in a juice cup is actually how they drink it ususally across the Atlantic. hmp, didn't know that.   All in all, don't think I'll be getting sauced with Sauce again."}
{"text":"Things I loved: great prices, good location, good service, the rolls, everything was ready fast!  Thing I did not love: the chlorine taste my pizza had. My boyfriend likes Sauce and I hadn't been there in years so I decided to give it another shot! Wasn't too crowded when we went, and I was happy to see all of the vegetarian pizza options! The bruchetta looked good too. I was incredibly hungry when I came and was so grateful that we were able to order and receive our food pretty quickly! I ended up getting the artichoke portabella mushroom pizza. My boyfriend got one with chicken sausage or something, I don't remember but I do know that he liked it! The pizza looked so amazing when it arrived and I was happy to see the thin crust. The outside was crispy and I liked it! Almost cracker-like. It was good. The middle got a little too soggy, was flopping when I picked the slice up. But was still not too bad! The one weird thing was every few bites I'd get a chlorine smell/taste. My boyfriend did not have this issue with his pizza so idk what was wrong with mine! Maybe it was the water the vegetables were washed with or something?  It wasn't so strong that it was inedible or I felt the need to complain, but it was odd. The rolls were great though I loved them haha. Well I still feel unsure of Sauce but I'm not totally opposed to returning!"}
{"text":"Okay in a pinch when you are absolutely craving pizza and a salad, but it's not so much faster that you coudn't run in somewhere else.  Maybe if you are really frazzled and need to take the kids out to a meal but don't want to disturb other people.  Can't say that the food is offensive, its just not great."}
{"text":"Delicious pseudo Italian food at an affordable price. Not quite fast food but quick and easy to grab on the way home. Everything is super fresh which makes all the difference in taste. The wine selection is \"interesting\", haven't found anything I liked but nothing terrible either. We usually get dinner to go so that's usually a nonissue anyway. Only thing that has bothered me in the past is the parking is horrible. It's a poorly planned out lot with tiny spots anyway but on more than one occasion I have seen employees parking right in front. Again not a huge deal but irksome, especially since there is no designated Take Out spot. At most times of the day you'll end up trekking it from far out in the lot if you have anything other than a compact car."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza toppings are mozzarella and basil and Sauce answers my pizza needs with toppings and excellent crust.  The staff was friendly, it's clean, the prices are agreeable and you can get a Peroni while you wait for your pie."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice! So far had a great experience! Good friendly staff and the food is great!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at Sauce and have had many dishes. Every time the food has been fresh and made in a timely manner. Also enjoy the atmosphere of the place. Could be a little more friendly with the bread rolls. Overall have had solid experiences at Sauce."}
{"text":"Sam Fox needs to have a talk with a certain employee at this Sauce location.  Sam, can you please advise your staff of the following:  When a lady walks up to your counter and orders a pizza and salad, don't then turn to her 4 year-old and say \"Wouldn't you like to have a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie today, too?\" while nodding and smiling at the little cherub. He doesn't have any money, so you can direct your questions to me.  And if I wanted a cookie, I would've ordered it.    Also, when you drop off a pizza to a table and you hear a mother say to her small child, \"eat a little more of your salad before having pizza\", please don't look at the mother like she has two heads.  You can also refrain from saying things like, \"Really??? You make him eat SALAD before he can have pizza??  NO WAY!\" and shaking your head and laughing as you walk away.  This behavior is disturbing to parents who want their children to be not obese.  As for the food, it's good.  The pizza is very light and more like a cracker baked with a smidge of sauce & toppings than actual pizza made with dough.  The side salad is a nice-sized portion for $4.  I also like the fountain Sobe and kid's drink for $1.  Thankfully, my son was happy to be out with his mom having pizza and ignored the waiter completely :)"}
{"text":"I stopped in Sauce today for lunch to take a break from shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square...it was a great choice.  Sauce is a good place if you want lunch while you are out shopping, but don't want typical mall food court options.  It's similar to a place like Pei Wei, where you place your order at the counter and your food is brought to you at a table.  I ordered the grilled cheese panini (mozzarella, fontina and cheddar), a slice of cheesecake, and a glass of Riesling.  My total was $15 for those three items, so not too bad at all.  The sandwich was delicious...the cheeses were melted together perfectly and they all complimented each other very well.  The cheesecake was nothing spectacular...not bad, but not amazing.  My friend's salad looked delicious, so much so that a woman came over and asked her about it.    My only two negatives about Sauce are: *the wine list was a bit lacking for a place that says it's a pizza and wine place...I think there was only like six choices or so for wine. *you can't take your wine outside, according to the guys behind the counter. So if you want to eat outside, don't order any wine.  We saw people outside drinking beer, so I'm not sure what the complete story is."}
{"text":"Sauce is A~OK with a solid 3 star rating because the service is excellent their turkey and feta salad is amazing but their pizza is unique and just OK at best.  My son and bride would give them a 4 or 5 star rating for their salads and mac~n~cheese, but since this my review and I eat pizza, they are a 3 stars.  They are conveniently located in the Norterra Shopping area making this place a go to prior to catching a movie or doing some shopping.  We found it best to go when they are having their special (1 pizza, 2 drinks and a salad for $20) and it is a really good deal. The turkey and feta salad with turkey, feta, corn, cucumber, tomato, avocado & almonds is one of the best salads I've had at a pizzeria. They also have a new, very tasty Chicken, Spinach & Apple salad with gorgonzola and candied walnuts.  Yum!  Again my son says their mac~n~cheese is awesome and we like their little bread roles.  We've tried almost all of their pizzas and you would think having a name like \"Sauce\" and advertising pizza as your specialty this would imply they have amazing pizza sauce.  But no, it's average tasting at best and there's barely any of it (sauce that is) or toppings on their pies.  There crust is good providing it's not burnt.  We've had to send a few back due to severe \"char~age\" around the edges.  Don't get me wrong, it's decent pizza and the crust is surprisingly good for being so thin, but still I could go to Barro's and get a more filling pizza that tastes just as good for the money.   The service was great. It's one of those places that you go in, order at the register, pay and then pick a table, sit down and wait for your food to be brought to you.  Our food usually comes out quickly, so we are very happy with the service and can plan to see a movie after wards.   Great place to go for the value if they are having their special!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time frequenter of Sauce.  Two words: caprese bruschetta.  Oh my, divine.  I also love the chicken Caesar salad pizza.  This past week my son and I stopped in for a quick to go order and their pizza oven was down.  I was devastated and as luck would have it a Monsoon storm hit as we were ready to leave, so we waited it out.  While waiting the oven was fixed and the owner treated me to a pizza on the house.  It was a very serendipitous day indeed. I received both rain and pizza in one perfect afternoon."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Wanted to go to Federals but thought I needed to try Sauce. We had the pepperoni pizza, caprese bruschetta, turkey and feta salad. Pepperoni pizza was just okay. Tasted like it came from a box. The salad and caprese bruschetta were good, not great. Service was good too, staff made sure we were taken care off. Love the patio, place was clean, had good music. If it weren't for the pizza i would have given it 4 stars.  I will be back but not soon."}
{"text":"Do you like cracker-like, ultra crunchy pizza crust? Then this is the place for you.   The menu consists of salads, pizzas and I think a couple pastas and sandwiches. My sister and I came here for lunch with her two young boys (ages 5 and 3). It's the type of place where you order at a counter, they give you a number and then bring your food to you. There is a soda fountain with the usual suspects and some teas.   My sister ordered the chicken Caesar pizza, I had the mushroom and pepperoni. My pizza was overly greasy and hers had to be eaten with a knife and fork. The crust is just ridiculous. I'm not kidding when I say it's like a cracker. Only mine got soggy from the grease.  The boys did not like their food. The 5 year old had a cheese pizza, the crunch was weird to him and the black stuff on the bottom from the wood fired oven FREAKED HIM OUT. He picked off all the cheese and pretended to eat the pizza all while attempting to avoid the black stuff.   The 3 year old had the grilled cheese and he sort of enjoyed it, barely. They use two types of cheese and press it in a panini, which is a little high brow for someone who still sometimes pees his pants.   Overall, I sort of enjoyed it, but would not return."}
{"text":"I had bought the gift cards through Costco and decided to go here for dunch (late lunch, early dinner).   One orders from the menus on the wall, walk up to the cashier and order, and the food is brought to the table.   My daughter had the Italian chopped salad with its advertised pepperoni, sopressata, smoked mozzarella, pepperoncini,kalamata olives, yellow tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, red onions, roasted garbanzo beans & roasted garlic vinaigrette.   And when they say, chopped, they do mean chopped.   I tasted, and it was quite tasty.  Quite a mixture of ingredients with the tasty vinaigrette.  I had the pasta with chicken, broccoli & cheese sauce.   It was much like mac and cheese with added broccoli, chicken, and, of course, its cheese sauce.  I put in the obligatory chili flakes.   Lots of cheese.   And it was quite tasty.     Since I have the gift cards, I'll return.   The price is right and so is the food.   Shall try something more from the menu."}
{"text":"Totally a fan of this place.  The pizza is great both thin and hand tossed.  The spinach salad and Caesar salad are also very tasty. Not a fan of the chicken that they put in their salads, so I get it without the chicken.  The employees have been nice all the times I have been so no complaints there."}
{"text":"Chopped salads are YUMMY.  and bruschetta!??  soooooo good  i usually get a vegetable chopped salad and add chicken (omg, the avocado makes this thing), and a bowl of the tuscan tomato soup.  Great lunch, although I think the soup is a little too creamy for me, even though it tastes DEELICIOUS.  I haven't tried the pizzas, but they're on my list!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times, and everything we've ordered has been delicious.  My husband and son loved the lasagna, from the just-right al dente texture to the sauce that left them wanting more.  The next visit, a friend and I split a caprese bruchetta appetizer and a thin crust pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and artichokes.    But I have to admit I come back here, not for the Italian fare, but for an unusual salad that I highly recommend to veggie lovers.  Called Winter Roasted Vegetable Salad, it is a wondrous combination of brussel sprouts, butternut squash, cauliflower, dried cranberries, and candied walnuts.    Sauce has a good variety of pastas and paninis -- love the meatball and mozzarella one. The only downside to this restaurant is the lack of desserts.  For a long time you could only get tiramisu, then not even that was offered.    Sauce is a fast-casual restaurant, where you order at the counter, then sit down.  Service is friendly, and food arrival is never too long."}
{"text":"I liked the pizza at Sauce. We tried the pepperoni and mushroom, and the chicken sausage and poblano pizzas. Both were really good, thin but chewy crust, good sauce, more than enough for one person. Cute interior, good service."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and service! I have celiac disease and the gluten free pizza is the best pizza i have had!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here and split a Caesar salad and a gluten-free pizza. Their gluten-free crust is among the best gluten-free pizza I've had. We enjoyed the food and the casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I expected a lot from this Sauce after eating at the one in Tucson multiple times and loving it, but it did not meet. My first time coming here the food was decent, but my grilled cheese sandwich was dry and so was the tomato soup. I thought it was just a one time thing, but the next time I went I had an order to go and when I asked the young man who  was doing the to go orders if I could please get my complimentary bread he rolled his eyes!!! When I got home, my sandwich was burnt and the soup was even more fry than the first!"}
{"text":"GREAT place! There, plain and simple...GREAT food! Great everything! We love it here. Never too crowded, very relaxing and , oh ya...GREAT food. I LOVE the Tomato soup, the best I have ever had. Mac and Cheese, also the best I have ever had. Pizza is great, and Meatball panini is wonderful! You want a great chocolate chip cookie???? Then here is where you will find it! mmmmmmmmm......cookie...aaaahhhhhhh!!! The people are so nice here and helpful! We have been here too many times to count! You will not be disappointed. Fair prices, and that always makes me say \"Woo Hoo\"!"}
{"text":"A nice place to stop in for lunch.  I've had the pasta, pizza and panini. All have been pretty good for the price."}
{"text":"Lovely, chewy thin crust pizza here. Not a bad stop at all if looking for quick pizza, salad or sandwich options. Just know that it's \"fast casual\" so don't expect a nice lingering atmosphere on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for a quick lunch.  I was in here today and had the pasta with meatballs.  The meatballs and marinara sauce were good.  Nice flavors.  The pasta shells were overcooked and mushy.  Oh well."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the winter roasted vegetable salad, vegetable salad and the Mozzarella fontina pizza.  My daughter ordered the child's Mac and cheese.  Food was delivered quickly and the manager Cameron was very attentive and made sure we enjoyed our dining experience, he was also very personable.    I thoroughly enjoyed  vegetable salad and the Fontina pizza.  My daughter also really seemed to enjoy her macaroni and cheese and I liked it as I could tell it was homemade and had none of the artificial colorings that many of the kids macaroni and cheese have.  Great dining experience, we will definitely be coming back.  It's a child friendly restaurant but adult enough where I would come here with girlfriends for a glass of wine and a salad."}
{"text":"My wife and I love their salads and very thin crust pizza (we call it cracker pizza since it is always so crunchy).  Haven't had a bad experience at a \"Fox Concept Restaurant\" yet!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at this quick place to eat.   I had the Chicken and Pine Nuts salad.  The portion was perfect and it left me wanting to come back for it again.   The servers were very friendly and came by to ask us if we needed anything several times.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Chicken pesto pizza, TASTE.  Bruschetta,  TASTE. Though smaller tomato chunks would be ideal. Meatball panini, TASTE. Def coming back.   Screw those awful metal chairs though. Seriously some of the worst.   Dat food tho..."}
{"text":"The pizza was really greasy.  Ordered a create your own with mushrooms and it came loaded down, which might have been good except it that's all it was, mushrooms.  There was practically no cheese or sauce. The cheese pizza is surprisingly not boring with 3 different cheeses on it. The pizzas are big enough to share, if so desired. Hand stretched is a basically a thin crust pizza with a slightly raised crust. They serve Pepsi products and a wide variety of teas.  They offer patio dining which would be great if people with shopping bags and scooters didn't walk through it and bump everyone all the time.  While it was an ok pizza place next to fashion square we won't go back again."}
{"text":"I came by here the Sunday before Labor Day.  I have to say that the décor was done in a pleasant modern Mediterranean ambience.  Comforting.  The layout of the place is spacious and comfortable, but somewhat of a maze.   They could have done a better job cleaning the tables before you sit down.   I hate picking up my order and walking to a dirty table!    We ordered ice teas, two pizzas and a salad.  The food was good, but for three people it left something to be desired.  The portions are relatively small.  My four year old son was able to eat a cheese and basil pizza alone!  He was still hungry.  The salad hardly had any lettuce. The ingredients used are tasty and first rate.  The food is fresh.  Please increase the portions!  It is good, not great."}
{"text":"We went to the Pie Wei at Gainey last night and found it very pleasant and food was very fast & good. The service was good also.  I recommend it   Kay"}
{"text":"I've been here several times because it used to be a convenient place for my friends and me to come to for lunch, but over time we all just stopped coming.  The food here is not anything special.  Their pasta is overpriced and is just cheese and pasta. It tastes good, but it's not anything that is difficult to cook.  The pizzas are ok, but sound better on the menu than they actually are.  There are only a couple that I would actually ever order again, because all of the ones I have tried I did not like.  The salads are the worst of everything on the menu, in my opinion. They try to be healthy and creative with the ingredients, and there's nothing wrong with that, but they are bland and tasteless.  Also, my friend has gotten food poisoning from one of the salads, and it was probably just an accident, but it has left a bad memory of this place for me.  I know this review sounds like a 2-star review, and the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the food is not disgusting, it is just not great and not worth the price.  The service is good, they bring your food to your table and are great about getting you anything you want, but the food quality is just not there."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants !! It's fast and everything is very fresh not processed tasting, I also have to say the manager Eric always makes going here a pleasure he goes out of his way to always make sure everything is perfect, another reason we love this place!!"}
{"text":"Sauce is the absolute best. I would die for their Mac n Cheese. Service is excellent and the dining area is always clean. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Meh, I'm a fan.  When you want something predictable but solid, you go to sauce.  I'd avoid the pastas, but everything else on the menu is good!  My favorite is not the pizza here, but the turkey and feta salad.  Get light feta if you don't want your salad to be half cheese.  It's a great combinations of flavors and it fills you up quickly!"}
{"text":"Sauce has grown on me... particularly this location since this is the one I frequently end up at for a quick lunch or casual dinner spot near home.  I typically order chopped salads at lunch.  The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.    My husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal...   What I like about Sauce the most? Fast, friendly, and efficient service in a clean and casual environment.  The moderate pricing is also a big plus in my book... especially in this economy."}
{"text":"Great lunch place to get a drink with a vendor and enjoy a great meal, but still be able to keep a conversation going.  Sometimes you just do not want to not have a waiter interrupting your conversations every 5 minutes, but you do want semi elegant food and atmosphere. I have found this actually pretty hard to come by.  Well, if Italian food and wine are on your taste buds, this is the solution.  The food is fast and taste above average along with the service being above average, but that would only get it a 4 star rating.  The location and the fact they have alcohol there in the form of wine for a great price, makes it a 5.     Great food  Great price Great service for a counter order restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't let the \"pizza\" tag line throw you off.  There's salads, pannini's (sp?), pasta and desserts as well.  I had the vegetable salad and I added chicken and it was divine!  I appreciated that they chopped all the veggies so that they were the same size (size of kernel of corn).  And the chicken was NOT processed which was a big plus.  Overall--fresh food, tasty--win WIN!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetable and avocado salad to go.  I would rate this a 1 or 0, except that the salad that I got tasted pretty good despite the problems.  Two problems:   1)  Service Problem:  When I picked up, the young man who waited on me mumbles & talks fast.  The noise in the restaurant is loud and clattery, and this guy mumbles into his neck and runs everything together in a way that I couldn't hear over the restaurant patrons even though i was standing right in front of him.  Every single time he said something to me, I had to ask him to repeat it, sometimes more than once, but he never tried to speak in a normal tone.  (I have better than normal hearing.)  No matter how well he did everything else, the fact that he spoke in a way that demonstrated he didn't care about the customer was a huge black mark against customer service.   2)  Food Quality Problem:  The worst problem is that there were only two tiny, pinky-fingernail-sized slivers of avocado!  The rest of the salad was pretty good, but come on!  If you advertise a vegetable and avocado salad, that means the avocado is noticeable and somehow the highlight of the salad.  I thought at first that there was no avocado, but I dug around in it until I found the 2 tiny slivers, which anyone else might have missed.  If I hadn't been 10 miles away when we opened the salad, I would have returned it.  Instead I'm writing to alert others. This was our first visit, and we thought since it's a Fox restaurant and the prices are fairly high for what you get, that the quality would be good.  These two huge problems are enough to keep us from returning to this Glendale Road location.  We probably won't try any other location either."}
{"text":"The roasted winter vegetable salad was amazingly delicious. Sooo much yum. We also got the rosemary potatoes pizza which was also good."}
{"text":"Cashier recommended I do the spicy chicken sausage and boy was that a wonderful recommendation! Such a delicious pizza. We ordered two pizzas and said it would be about 15 minutes and it took only about 5 minutes! Wonderful accommodating staff too!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sauce several times and am always satisfied. I absolutely love the mozzarella, tomato and basil chopped salad. It is always so fresh and delicious. Perhaps I am just simple but their cheese pizza with mozzarella, fontina and basil is my favorite. Their crust is super thin and crunchy and the cheese is melty, salty and delicious. This isn't your normal cheese pizza, the slices melt in your mouth. I don't eat meat but my parents love their sausage pizza and the chicken noodle soup. The iced tea is decent and I enjoy that I can get a bottle of Fat Tire. Staff, although high school aged, are accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Sauce has been one of my favorite places to go especially because of their Mac n Cheese. Why in the world would they change their perfect recipe to bland spiral noodles that has barely any cheese on it?! So disappointing. I'm finding whatever I can in my kitchen to give this some flavor.   The only positive side to this was we had also ordered a side of Mac n cheese and it came in a big portion."}
{"text":"Tonight was my last night visiting a former Fox Restaurant  business that has gone downhill. I learned Sam sold off Sauce two years ago and it explains a lot. It used to be excellent..food, service, and upkeep. However, my last two visits have been very poor. So much so, that tonight when our pizza showed up 30mins  after our salads and it was cold and soggy. I outright asked for a refund. Something I normally would never do. The manager tried to tell me it was not sitting long, but you could tell by looking at it that was just bs. I've worked in the restaurant  business for some time. I would say your service is below standard. Cleanliness of this restaurant  was also in bad shape. On another note to the current owner that may or may not see this review. Management should look like managers. This young lady was not in business attire. She was so casual I didn't even know who she was when looking for assistance. So, that's why I stood back in line to ask for a refund. Total fail. Too bad..I will give my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I come here quite often for lunch as I work across the street. It gets very busy especially around noon so I try to get there early. The line gets busy and you walk up and order so it can take some time before receiving your food so if you are on a short time frame, make sure to call in your order or order online before hand.  Food is always good and fresh. The pizza original crust is a very thin hand toss which taste amazing and not as filling as normal pizza with all that thick bread. The margarita and simple pepperoni are my favorite. They also have great salads! I always get the chicken apple walnut salad. It comes with this juicy shredded chicken and amazing raspberry vinaigrette. They also serve each meal with rolls and butter.   In addition to your meal, make sure to get the passion black tea. It's amazing and super refreshing! Great place for lunch, dinner, or date night. They recently redid the decor so it's very pretty and modern inside. They also have a cute patio to eat and hang out on when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"You've got to get the caprese bruschetta when eating here.  Service is great. Food arrive quickly and hot. Prices are decent for the quality of service and food.  Nice menu options as well."}
{"text":"They built a Sauce in Minneapolis & it only lasted three months. I'll never understand why, but I'm excited they are in Arizona & plenty of them.   The Turkey & Feta salad is almost identical to my favorite at True Food Kitchen, which is a great thing. The paninis I've tried have always been good & come with a side of seasoned chips. I've never tried any of the pastas, but they all look wonderful as well.  Great place for a quick, affordable, good meal."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's fast and fresh.  I usually stop in for lunch and get the chopped, veggie salad and tomato soup.  The flavors in the salad are crisp and bright!  Food usually comes out quickly.   Yesterday I decided to mix it up and get the turkey/gouda sandwich with pesto instead.  I have to say, if this was the first time and the first thing I ordered from Sauce I would never go back...that's how bad it was.  Barely any pesto, lackluster flavor.  That sandwich was so disappointing...the only thing I enjoyed on that plate was the red pepper used as a garnish.  So guess I'll stick with my salad, I try to go early as that place fills up pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"The cashier was a little meh. But she was friendly enough in taking our order. Maybe I expect to much when I go into a place and tell them it's our first time? She was just kind of saying like \"okay, cool, here's the menu\"... that's good and all but dude, it's my first time, say things like \" oh sweet! welcome! I hope your visit is amazing!\" be excited for me! Well, rant over. But the food was great. We had some good eats here."}
{"text":"This was my favorite location but over the past few months they have been cooking their to-go orders as if they don't care, as if they place to-go orders at a lesser priority than dine-in orders. My pizza was burned to a crisp to the point it was inedible. They didn't bother to show me the order before leaving the location as if they were just trying to get me out the door. This has been going on for the past few months even after numerous calls to the management of the location, still nothing has been done. Seriously considering going to a further location if they don't eat their act together. Very displeased. PLEASE CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE LEAVING."}
{"text":"This location is always clean and playing good, quiet music which sets an amazing ambience. The employees are very knowledgeable about the menu and pleasant to deal with.   The food is priced right and always comes out good. I have never had one complaint about their meals. The pizza sometime lacks in cheese and thickness, but overall it's average.  The one thing I absolutely despise about this location-delivery of the plates. If you see two people sitting together, bring out the food at the SAME TIME! It's so irritating to be with somebody and have your food in front of you for ten minutes before they get there's."}
{"text":"Had a bit of a fiasco with the order. It had been put in a to-go bag and was waiting to be picked up, and the wrong order made it to the table. The server who took the wrong food back didn't think to follow up on where the right order might be. Manager put in a brand new order AND gave them the to-go order that had been sitting around. Double food, and she charged them nothing. Nothing for any of it."}
{"text":"Price is good, service was great.  Easy in and out. We'll be back.  ( had supreme pizza and garden salad)"}
{"text":"Love their pizza!!!  The make your own is cool.  My niece loved that she can create a pizza of her OWN.  We walked in and ordered... It was linner (4pm) but we were hungry after all the shopping.  My niece ordered a pepperoni and smoked ham pizza.  I got the chicken peso pizza.  We got our drinks, sat, and talked.  An employee asked if we wanted a chopped salad, they made 1 too many.  Sure, my niece inhaled it.  Her pizza came and I was told they made a mistake with mine.  Nice, so I am here watching her eat.  =(  My pizza finally came after 10 mins."}
{"text":"I like this place! Didn't think I would, but I do. The Cesar salad was great...but I like a lot of anchovy flavor, so take that into consideration. I also liked the pasta sauce. My 6-year old had a simple pasta with a meatball and we shared it...we both liked it. It also had a Pei Wei kind of feel to the arrangement of the place. Menus on the side wall you order and pay at the register and then they bring you your food. Cheesecake afterwards was nothing special but still met my sweet tooth (but they didn't have coffee so that was a bummer) I would go back."}
{"text":"Sauce was a delightful place to enjoy lunch with friends after a grueling hike up Piestewa Peak.   I have been really impressed with all of the other Fox Restaurant Concepts, so I was excited to finally try Sauce and see if it was on par with the others. Short answer: YES, this fresh Italian restaurant has something unique and delicious to offer!   It's not on the menu, but here's a little secret a friend shared: You can create your own half and half lunch combo! I ordered a half salad and bowl of soup which was perfect!   The Tuscan Tomato Soup was warm, full of flavor and perfect for dipping the complimentary warm bread roll.   The Golden Beet Salad with Quinoa, pistachios, avocado, goat cheese and other amazing goodness was in a word DELICIOUS! Seriously, if you like beets - you have to try this salad!  You can thank me later ;)  The service here was great. Staff were friendly - even came over to ask how our hike was and about my friend's FitBit fitness band. They even gave us an extra bread roll to enjoy later with our leftovers.   I'll definitely be back! There's just too much good stuff on the menu - I want to come back and try it all!"}
{"text":"This review comes a little late as my grown children and I ate at this location back in the late summer (August). It was our first time to dine there. We ordered the mac & cheese, pizza with pepperoni and olives, and pasta,-- red sauce and mozzarella (gluten free). It was a delightful visit, the food was cooked to near perfection, the pizza was fresh, with a thin crust.  I would recommend this establishment to others who like to have a nice place to eat pasta and pizza and drink wine. I didn't drink any wine this visit but I will try a glass on my next visit. Very helpful staff, relaxing atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Very delicious!  We had a pizza, grilled cheese kids meal and the caprese skewers. Everything came out quickly considering it is freshly made. Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. I had the spicy chicken pizza with a thin crust; I think next time I'm going to try the hand-tossed. First time I've been there and I really enjoyed it. I did try the Mac & Cheese and it was a little bit too rudimentary for me, very bland but I think something a kid would like more than adult. I might suggest them adding some of the poblanos chilis or even some of the spicy chicken inside of it, make it actually be attractive to an adult.  Again though overall for pizza was great. My sister had the chicken pesto and she loved it as well. I can't wait to go back there and try the same pizza with the hand-tossed."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. I ordered a quinoa, beet, and arugula salad and wild mushroom pizza. I can't complain about the salad but the pizza was underwhelming, it was on the dry side and I couldn't taste the truffle oil that it was supposedly drizzled with."}
{"text":"First time trying Sauce. We had it delivered by Door Dash. Wow! We customized our pizza and ordered the asparagus bruschetta. They do not play. Let me repeat they do not play, when it comes to their toppings. I have never seen it piled on so heavy. Amazing artisan crust. I can't believe we had not tried this place until now. Highly recommended for what we have tried thus far. Cannot wait for our next adventure there were so many items on the menu. And for it being as good as it was being delivered. I am very much looking forward to actually dining in and seeing their wine list and trying their options in store."}
{"text":"Keep it basic, and Sauce is good. We got a pepperoni pizza and an artichoke pizza - no one liked the latter. Their salad options are good and well sized for sharing - nothing too memorable though. There's an outside patio and they have wine. Overall, it's an okay option but there's lots of new places nearby."}
{"text":"Update: came back yesterday.... One year later. Same issues! Got our pizza first, then salad, then bruschetta and lastly our pasta. The pasta we had to go ask about since it still wasn't out 20 minutes after we ordered. Food was good.    We have been coming to sauce for years. We were so happy that this one was being built closer to our home. We've been to this one a couple times; lackluster each time. Today was no different. I ordered a salad and my husband ordered bruschetta and a panini. I got my salad first. When I was about done with it my husbands appetizer showed up and the panini right after. Timing at this place is an issue. If I order a salad and he orders his meal, you would think the appetizer would come out first and then my entree salad and his entree sandwich. We each watched each other eat at different times."}
{"text":"It's the Italian version of Pei Wei.  The pizza crust is so thin and so delicious!  To me, it's the perfect place for a casual date.  I love drinking wine out of a juice glass (just like my Italian grandpa)."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try out this pizza spot as it seems to be common in Phoenix and Arizona. I am a huge pizza fanatic. We ordered a few pizzas here as well as beers, the pizza was very very soon. Comparable to a chip or thin tortilla, I would definitely prefer something like Pizza Hut as we both left hungry."}
{"text":"Because This place is so darn consistent, it's always my go to when I'm just craving some great pizza and salads for a competitive price. Their manager Amy is doing a wonderful job running this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The caramelized onion and sausage pizza is so good! The pasta and salad is good to. I usually order pizza and a pasta or salad dish and take home what I dont eat. Small place but nice and food comes out really quick. I want to say more about this place cause my review seems small but its simply good eats. Check it out"}
{"text":"I like this chain of restaurants, but this specific location... Pizza is absolutely mediocre."}
{"text":"Overall I really like Sauce. Possibly the locations vary in service and quality slightly, but I think over the years the quality has diminished. For example, my favorite and one a week meal was the chicken pine-nut salad, but over the last couple years, the amount of chicken and pine-nuts has been significantly reduced. So much so that I complained once when my  salad arrived with maybe a tablespoon of pine-nuts (when I was used to about 3). There seems to be no consistency in the quantity and proportions of ingredients. For example, I enjoyed the kale and salmon salad the first time I had it (when it was first added to the menu), but now it's more romaine lettuce then kale!  The mac and cheese, a favorite of my husband, has also gone from a nice big portion, to a much smaller one.  Overall, Sauce has great food. The problem is you can never really expect to get the same dish when you order the same dish... Except maybe the pizzas.  Last- why don't the rolls come in whole grain wheat too?"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and today was disappointing.  The food is good but I ordered half salad and half pasta. My wife ordered the vegetable salad. The pasta came out within a few minutes. The salads literally came out 15 minutes later. I don't understand how that happens. I ended up sharing my pasta with my wife while we waited for the salads. Plus, we were like one of 3 couples in the restaraunt at the time.  I like this place but I'm unsure if we will return, especially with so many options nearby."}
{"text":"Great place, fast service, lots of options. You really can't go wrong here. If you're not in the mood for pizza, you can get a salad, panini, or pasta; I've never tried their panini or pasta options, but they sound very good, and their salads are definitely really good! Nice and fresh. My favorite would probably have to be the chicken, spinach and apple one, but they're really all good.   Usually for pizza, my friends and I will each get our own (they only come in 12\", which is too bad - you can't get something bigger or smaller depending on how hungry you are) and just share them all. Favorite so far is the Chicken Pesto, but I also wanna try the Portobello and Artichoke. You can choose thin or thick crust, but get thin - it's best by far.  Cool, fun vibe. Love to come here, and will more and more in the future!"}
{"text":"Great urban atmosphere, great food, fast service, and the bathrooms were clean! Definitely recommend! Would recommend the tomato basil pizza ($8), and the tomato bruschetta ($5)."}
{"text":"I want to recognize a young man named Keith who took our order and assisted me and my daughter during my visit tonight. He greeted us when we arrived. He was respectful and accommodating in ways that we have NEVER experienced at this Sauce. He checkup on us. We, have, had good service before, but this was different.  Thank you, Keith for making our dining experience exceptional to say the least!"}
{"text":"Finally made it into Sauce last night for the first time. There are so many chain restaurants here that we had always passed up what we thought was \"just another pizza joint\". I was very impressed!!! We tried the Pepperoni and Sausage and Chicken Pesto pizzas and also had the Turkey and Feta salad! Everything was delicious! The quality was amazing for the quick service! The menu was good sized and this will be one of those places where it's hard to choose something new next time!"}
{"text":"My husband didn't like the pizza but I loved it. I usually don't eat the crusts, but I did for this one. They didn't offer a vegetarian type, so we had to custom make it and I felt it was having to do that was a bit expensive. The olives were too salty, but the pizza was good."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed my last experience at Sauce. I ordered a spinach and apple salad with chicken. I think the apples were from a few days ago wtih no taste and the shredded chicken must have been in the freezer and put on the salad. The kids however did enjoy their mac and cheese. The salad was terrible!"}
{"text":"Interacted with the manager and that food was great.   Service was good (my only feedback would be wipe off tables as you clean them off). Great value for the price."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, clean restrooms, food comes fast and is always great! I love the thin crust pizzas, and the tomato basil soup that comes with fresh bread and butter is my favorite, a must have!! We go there at least once or twice a month and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I had been to one of the Scottsdale locations before but this was my first time at the Norterra location. We chose to stop in because of thie summer special they are running... A pizza, salad, and two glasses of wine for $20. I just had a pepperoni pizza and caesar salad but I have had the caesar salad pizza before and it is also really good. The ordering process at Sauce is similar to Pei Wei which makes for a casual environment but a great dinner before a movie. We are glad that they opened up this location."}
{"text":"Been to Sauce a couple of times, and just realized that I haven't done a review for this location! We've had a couple of different things from here. During one of our visits we decided on two different specialty pizzas to try out and I have to say that it was more than enough for the two of us and then some. We ended up boxing up a couple of slices from each of them and taking it home with us.  Next go-round we were more well informed and decided on sharing a pizza with half and half toppings so we could both get the style we like most, but still share. Since we were sure to share the main dish, we were able to get the Tiramisu for dessert.   There isn't much interaction with staff at these locations after your initial order at the front cashier. Someone brings out your meal, but drinks and all else are up to you. The cashiers on both visits were nice enough and seemed to move the line quickly.   Overall: B+ Definitely A-OK!"}
{"text":"This location was recommended by a co-worker so we planned to head there for dinner that very night. It didn't disappoint.  We arrived around 7:30 p.m. and were able to walk right up to the register to order before taking out seats with a number.  I'm happy to have this place as my 100th review!  Yay!  We decided to share the Sausage and Caramelized Onion pizza, a small order of the Pasta with Meatballs and the Tiramisu. Wanted to try a little of everything seeing as how this was our first visit and all.    The pasta was our least favorite - but wasn't bad!  There was only one meatball added to the small bowl order and the pasta was a touch overcooked so it was a little pasty.  Again, not a bad choice, just not the best ever pasta and meatball.    The pizza however, was delicious.  We chose the hand-tossed bread and it was really tasty.  The touch of sweet from the caramelized onions was a great blend with the savory sausage topping and cheese.   The service was really well done.  The tiramisu wasn't brought out until we wanted it and the server was nice enough to have it held until that time - seems to be the norm here. They also brought out a box and cleared the table as soon as plates were empty.  As for the tiramisu - it was light and fluffy and had a great flavor to it - I'd order it again in a heartbeat.  Overall: A- The pasta may have been a miss, but the rest was two thumbs up! We recommend the sausage pizza and the tiramisu without hesitation."}
{"text":"I like Sauce. I've always liked Sauce. The food is always good, consistent, quick, and rather reasonably priced. I always get the turkey & feta salad along with the pesto pizza on thin crust."}
{"text":"For the two times I've been to this location on the weekend, it is practically deserted. I feel like we are always the only people in the restaurant, but the staff and service is always great.   We came there recently after a bike ride outdoors and this place hit the spot- we ordered the pesto chicken thin pizza and the chicken and pine nuts salad. I liked all of it as the food was consistent to other sauce restaurants, but hubby didn't like the Gorgonzola on the salad. The staff noticed his disappointment and offered to give him something else and he politely declined.   Overall, I like this location and will be back."}
{"text":"Back in the day (really maybe a year ago), I used to love Sauce - inexpensive, quick, and consistent food.  I decided to visit yesterday for dinner.  The restaurant was not too busy and I get to the line (and the chalkboards overwhelmed me) - so I decided to order based on memory.  I ordered the gluten free pesto chicken pizza and the boyfriend got the meatballs with pasta.    We sit down and the meatballs and pasta came first - it was ok.  I was hungry so I snatched a few bites.  The pizza came and it was way overcooked.  An employee saw my pizza and asked me if the pizza was ok - maybe bc she noticed how brown it was.  I really didn't fuss about it since I was starving and I really didn't want to wait for another one.  At the end of the meal, I was a little disappointed.    Sauce just doesn't do it for me anymore."}
{"text":"Cockroaches crawling up the inside window. Staff did little to acknowledge this until I screamed in front of everyone inside during lunch. Manager said it was a water bug. Ya right, honey. Thanks for the expired appetizer card. I wasn't going to use it anyhow."}
{"text":"Great pizza on a thin crust, perfect for takeout. My favorite is the portabella artichoke.  Their mac n cheese is alright, but I've had much better. Their Tiramisu now come in strange circular cups. Not as good as they used to be."}
{"text":"I am not a salad eater but the chicken pine nut salad is out of this world! Pizza is tasty as well. Seemed a bit over priced but still a great place to eat. I've been here 6 or so times and will still continue to eat here."}
{"text":"The pizza was good nothing special in my opinion but the Mac N Cheese wowed me! Honestly the best mac n cheese I've had in such a long time and I would totally go back just for the mac n cheese. The location is really nice and clean the service was really nice and friendly. They also have A GREAT patio and is perfect for big groups."}
{"text":"It's a cheap and quick meal when you're in a hurry.  The paper thin crust pizza is fine and we always finish all of it.  The salads are tasty and fresh.  If you want authentic pizza, this is not the place."}
{"text":"We visit this Sauce regularly and are always  pleased with the quality of food and service. On the rare occasion they do not get the order exactly right, they visit your table with a sincere apology and make it even better than originally requested. Everyone is polite and truly interested in our comfort and helping to provide an enjoyable dining experience. Today we had two pizzas and split a Caesar salad and had take away, and they even accommodated us so we could wrap the food and fit it in the saddle bag of our tandem bicycle."}
{"text":"I really liked the pizza - the crust is very thin and crispy just the way I like it.  Very fresh salads too.  They have a nice patio area.  I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. I've been here to Sauce now twice. I've never actually eaten at the restaurant itself, but instead, both times got our food to go. First visit: several months back. We called in and placed our order, when we went in, 20 minutes later (when the girl on the phone said it would be ready) they hadn't even started our order yet. When we got the food, it was okay. I wouldn't rave about it, but I also wouldn't speak anything negative either. Second visit: I ordered online, went in at precisely the time the online app said it would be ready, and it was! This made me excited because I was really hungry. The girl at the counter was nice, and the guy who brought me my pizzas showed them to me to check for accuracy, which is cool, because how much would it suck to get home and realize your order was wrong?? My only problem, and maybe it's my fault for ordering something so bland, but the basil mozzarella pizza was just okay... it wasn't great... it was just okay. BUT the part that really disappoints me is the fact that the crust tasted so bland. My favorite part of the pizza is the crust because I'm a weirdo.   Anyway, I don't dislike Sauce, but I also don't LOVE Sauce. I will probably eat here again in the future, but I see it being a little ways away in the distance."}
{"text":"mom and i met up for a shopping adventure, but before we shopped we needed to eat. woman cannot live on great deals alone! so we headed into sauce, right after the lunch rush. service was efficient and friendly. our table was dirty so we cleaned it ourselves. our food was delivered without plates or silverware. both of our chopped salads were pretty-on-the-plate and filling. i'm always amazed by how filling a sauce salad can be. a clean table and silverware/plates we didn't have to chase down would have earned this sauce 4 stars."}
{"text":"i'm consistently happy with this location. we always get takeout - a pepperoni pizza and the pasta, chicken and cheese, and an extra roll. the pizza is really good, and really light. i like that they use a lot of garlic, most of the time. the pasta, chicken and cheese lives up to its name with tender chicken, perfect tubular pasta and cheese, tossed with some broccoli. i'm not sure if the sauce is actually cheese, or alfredo, or both, but either way it is consistently good. they give us an extra roll at no charge, which is kind and saves us from squabbling. parmesan and red peppers are standard and appreciated with the pizza. service is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"This place has good food but terrible service.  Do not order take-out or pickup. Without fail they will mess it up EVERYTIME. No matter if you order online, phone, or postmates; they will always mess it up. It's crazy how they just throw whatever they want in the to-go bag without checking it. Last night I ordered a chicken walnut salad and received the beet and quinoa salad. Not only was there no chicken but I'm allergic to beets!!"}
{"text":"Pizza * Wine  I drive by Sauce nearly every day and those two words on the side of the building just kept calling to me.  Pizza * Wine  Come in!  Today!  Really!  I finally listened.  After a long day I was ready for something tasty and convenient that (most importantly) I didn't need to cook myself.  Sauce definitely fit the bill.  It is a casual yet kind of industrial/trendy place.  It is also FAST!  In no time at all I had walked up to the counter, ordered my meal, and was enjoying my juice glass (!) of pinot grigio.  I went with the most basic of pizzas - mozzarella & fontina cheese with basil.  While it was not what I typically think of as \"pizza\" - the crust was super-thin and kind of crispy, especially at the edges - it was tasty!  The cheese and sauce complimented the crisp crust nicely.  Yes, I ate The Whole Thing.  No to-go box here!  I justify this by telling myself that crust that thin wouldn't reheat well...  Yeah, right...  Overall Sauce is a good spot for a quick, casual meal.  I would have liked a slightly larger juice glass for my wine, though..."}
{"text":"Good pizza, kids love this place, no real healthy options. Cesar with chicken was overdressed"}
{"text":"Good salad selection, healthy choices, great beverage choices.  Prices were pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Every girl I know that lives in Phoenix ranks this place as one of her Top Five lunch spots around, but I'm still not sold on it. Sure, now and again I'll want to have a lighter, healthier lunch (something other than a burrito - I like to mix it up) and Sauce is good for that. But I feel like it tries to be upscale without actually being upscale, and casual without actually being casual either. It's in that strange netherworld where you're not sure if you're overdressed or overly caj, overfed or underserved, overpaying or overexpecting.   The thin crust pizzas are actually really good, but light, so if you have a serious appetite don't be surprised if it don't need a box to take home extra slices. The house pizzas have interesting topping blends like artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes (err . . . maybe that's not that interesting. What can I say? I like heavy things with meat on them that you can empty entire jars of parmesan cheese onto. Any deviation from dense cheese and meat is \"interesting\" to me).   They bring your food to your table (Pei Wei style) with one piece of packaged bread. This also slightly irks me. The bread is really good but they can't spring for baskets? If you're looking for New York style pizza that drips with cheese and thick pepperoni pieces, Sauce isn't your spot. For a light afternoon lunch or snack and a glass of wine, it gets the job done."}
{"text":"I got the garden veggie salad (the one with squash and brussle sprouts) and it was sooo good! Lots of flavors and a savory dressing drizzled over the top, nice and healthy! Cool, clean, modern inside. I like that there is a coupon when you check in here on Yelp!"}
{"text":"The guys that runs this joint owns some of the nicer resturants in town. Later I learned there are a few Sauce's around but that didn't change my excitement for this place.  Pizza and Wine. What else is needed?  Thin crust pizza, great salads, wine and panini. Ive never had the meat balls but tons of ppl were ordering that w/ their meals. Ordered the chicken, pine nut salad which was awesome and split the chicken ceaser salad pizza with a friend.  Place is causal, quick and good food, and filling."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices.  I loved the mac and cheese... although very heavy :)"}
{"text":"We love sauce! The chicken Caesar salad pizza is my go-to. It's fresh and so good every time. It's big enough to share for sure. The Mac n cheese is excellent too. We order it for our daughter and eat half of it ourselves haha. They have tons of options like lasagna, build your own pizzas and pastas and amazing chopped salads. It's more fast food than not and prices are fair for how big the portions are. I am always down for sauce."}
{"text":"I really wish they would have had solo diner friendly items on the menu so I wouldn't be forced to eat a whole salad and a whole pizza all by myself.  I've taken to wearing maternity shirts when ever I go out to eat now so that I don't get ghastly looks from other customers wondering why I'm eating so much.  I ordered the spinach salad with pancetta and goat cheese (see pics) It was alot, why couldn't they have made me a half order?? Although I had  no problem eating it, it was just delicious, I loved the pancetta vinaigrette, it was perfect. It came with a sourdough roll and butter.  I would return just to eat this salad.  I also ordered the Wild Mushroom and Truffled Arugula Pizza.  (see pics) Again alot of food, you won't find slices here or personal size pies. Needless to say I did finish it all.  It had a light, thin and crispy crust ,almost cracker like. I thought it was good but really lacking in flavor, I put salt on it...didn't help much...it was just kinda bland, I liked it but I've had Better.  Even though you order at the counter, get your drink and seat your self, There is waiter service to come and refill my drink, which was nice because I sat outside and wouldn't have liked to leave my food alone to go inside and refill my glass.  My waiter was Awesome and refilled my glass about 4 times......Afterall I was really thirsty from eating that saltine crust.  I  moved the stars up to four because the staff was so nice, my glass never emptied, I even got a to go cup full and I was kindly greeted upon arrival and departure."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  I've been to another location for Sauce, and it's the same everywhere.  Good food, a little pricey, but there's no wait, other than the line in front of you.  (This was a backup for Olive & Ivy, because we didn't make a reservation.  Great second choice!)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food was great, an overall great experience! Thank you, Cameron and staff! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"First time I picked up my lunch here there were little white worms on my basil mozzarella skewers. Second time (shouldn't have trusted it) they screwed up our entire offices order so bad I had to drive back and ask them to fix it. We got some free cookies and comped pizza I guess. But I've personally lost all hope on this place. Plus I'm not sure if they are very clean behind closed doors... you know.. since I had wormy food."}
{"text":"I would knock someone over for this pizza - its really, really, really good.  And I always get the chicken/pine nut salad.  It's such a simple, fresh combination and it just works.  But something ALWAYS goes awry with the delivery/service when I come here.... forgotten rolls, missing silverware, etc.  It just seems like turnover is extremely high so I'm sure its simply inexperience, but for a fast/casual place with a limited menu you'd think some things would be a given."}
{"text":"Pizza is so good and very reasonably priced. We did a build your own with red sauce, prosciutto, spicy chicken, smoked mozzarella, and caramelized onions. It was bomb. We also did the meatball bruschetta. This was ok. It was only $5 so it's not like we wasted a whole lot of money on it but we'd probably try a different one. Food came out in a timely matter and staff was very friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a delicious Italian food chain place. Not authentic Italian food, but it gets the job done. Perfect for lunch, and their lunch specials get a thumbs up! They also do a pizza and bottle of wine for $20!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is not bad but you order two pizzas a couple glasses of wine you're talking close to 40 bucks it's just not worth it if I'm gonna spend that much money able to go to three or four star restaurant and order something"}
{"text":"Whenever we want to eat a decent, Italian style pizza we order from Sauce. The original thin crust is actually thin. I mean THIN. So thin, that I don't feel bad about eating carbs. Because it's almost not there. Honestly. And I love it. If you need a bit more dough, you can go with the hand stretched one. You won't be disappointed. The Tuscan tomato soup is a must try. Try it. TRY IT."}
{"text":"I probably go to Sauce once every two weeks to be honest. Some of the best thin crust pizza and MAC N CHEESE.... so yummy and super friendly people work here."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. The artichoke pizza was ok, but would have been better with a white sauce vs red. The roasted veggie salad was awesome!! A perfect combination of flavors, and the veggies were cooked perfectly. It was so good that I'm going to try to make it at home. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sauce is my absolute fav. I don't think I've had a single thing there that I haven't liked. While they are pretty well known for their pizza which is absolutely delish, I usually tend to eat a little on the healthier side and get either the turkey and feta salad or this other salad that has pears in it (I kind of forget exactly what it is, but I've gotten it a few times). I also like the soup and you can't go wrong with their turkey sandwich either. Oh, and their mac n cheese!!! So delish. Those are pretty good standbys, and it's nice that they give you bread and butter on the side no matter what you order, even if you do get a sandwich which a lot of places tend to skimp on the bread if you ordered bread as a staple of your meal (which is probably better for you anyway, but thanks for the extra bread, Sauce!) It's also nice that it's really close to a lot of stuff, so it's a good lunch spot during the work day. Don't get caught browsing at Urban Outfitters while you wait for your food though or you might get stuck spending 100 bucks in about 5 minutes like I did last time I went. Yikes."}
{"text":"We were feeling suuuuper lazy one night so decided to get delivery, and sauce was the best option. I can't comment on the ambience or the service, but the food was great!   I loved the fact that even the delivery order came with bread, and that they use cavatappi (the best kind of pasta) in their chicken, broccoli, and cheese sauce pasta. Its probably sacrilegious for me to say, but I liked the fact that they used cheese sauce and didn't just make it a chicken and broccoli mac and cheese; the sauce is smoother, and it allows the chicken and broccoli flavors to shine through. The strawberry-basil lemonade was a bit sweet for my liking, but I loved the combination of flavors, and would get it again."}
{"text":"Mmm...Chicken and Pine Nut salad and a glass of wine. Heaven.  Sauce is such a cool hangout. They offer the best pizzas and pasta (and salad!) that you will ever have in your life! This location in Dana Park is fantastic, but it is super busy (a testament to the great food, mind you).  If you haven't been here, you need to get here."}
{"text":"The reason for two stars is due to the food. The service, like most Fox restaurants, is garbage.   Don't bother placing an order for pickup. I placed a simple order (salad, and Mac & Cheese) and was told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. I arrived 25 minutes later and still had to wait another fifteen minutes. While waiting, I noticed that the manager was going around and asking other people, who also ordered for take out, what their orders were. It was pretty obvious that they were understaffed and it's likely that the orders aren't placed until you actually arrive in the restaurant.   UPDATE: I took the rating down to one star because upon arriving at home with my food I found out that they forgot to put turkey on their Turkey and Feta Salad... They forgot one of the ingredients that is in the name of the dish."}
{"text":"There is a nice wine and beer selection though I thought my pinot grigio was a bit astringent.  The mozzarella, fontina, basil pizza was a bit of a disappointment.  For some reason I thought there would be some cheese on it as the name implied. I paid extra for pepperoni and there was pepp on the pizza and basil, which is good, but where was the cheese?  The crust was paper thin cracker and it was good for paper thin cracker.  There wasn't much tomato sauce to speak of either. It just felt more like an appetizer and less like pizza. The other thing is that the chairs are all hard, cold steel and are so very uncomfortable. If you want people to stay a minimum of time at your restaurant then provide cold, hard steel - it works. I hope this chair fad passes quickly because I now look at the chairs before I decide to frequent a particular restaurant. When you consider how many restaurants are in the area it is unlikely that I will return to this one."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Seems to have gone down hill just a little. The mac and cheese is different and definitely not as good. Sometimes when they're busy it's hard to get the attention of a server. Salads and pizzas are always solid."}
{"text":"I love Sauce! Met a girlfriend after a workout class last night & it was actually my first time eating inside, normally my boyfriend and I get takeout. We got a caprese salad, pepperoni pizza, and a side of meatballs to split. The caprese salad was delicious and different than I expected it was a salad with lettuce with chunks of tomatoes, mozzarella, and pieces of bread, I would definitely get this again! Side note: the Caesar salad is really good too. I am a huge fan of the pizzas, they are thin crust, I've had a few different ones and enjoyed all of them, perfect to split between 2 people (~$8-10 per pizza). Its a nice place if you want to have a casual meal, you order at the front then they deliver your food to you (sort of like a pei wei or noddles& co)."}
{"text":"The Suprema pizza was delicious. The vegetable salad was good as well. Service was fine, little hiccup on bringing the wine to the table, but no big deal.   I liked it!"}
{"text":"Very casual place and the service was good. I was happy with my beet, quinoa and arugula salad. Although I wasn't crazy with the cannoli that I had because it was OK not wow.  Overall it was a good quick lunch place."}
{"text":"The cafeteria setting was always a turn off for me but finally gave in to giving it a shot.  Salad was soso-think some of the tomatoes were bad.  But I thought the pizza and pasta were pretty good.  I would definetly go there next time a pasta craving comes around..but maybe will get it to go to avoid sitting in the uncomfortable chairs."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place with another couple on a Monday afternoon. We were in the area vacationing from the Midwest. The other 3 shared a thin crust pizza and had side salads. They said it was very tasty. I had a mixed green salad. The salad was good too. The service however was slow. Though they weren't busy, we got the pizza 10 minutes before any of the salads arrived- and got a minimal apology for the delay."}
{"text":"It's been a lil bit since I've made a stop into Sauce- but had to write up a review bc I've never been disappointed with their service or their food- I'm a fan of the Fox restaurant's and this on in particular is a fave. My fave pizza is the Rosemary Potato (spinach, feta and Olive tapenade) as for the salad the Chicken, pine nuts & gorgonzola is a winner.. seriously very tasty. They really have a lil bit of everything when it comes to pasta dishes as well and the location is convenient if you're walking around waterfront."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Sauce multiple times in the last few weeks.   Always consistently great, well prepared and generous portions we have yet to be disappointed in anything.   We have used Postdates, which has had a couple challenges, but no fault of Sauce. GrubHub once also with challenges but no fault of the restaurant.   Our favorites are the wild mushroom pizza with arugula, lasagna pie pizza, the quinoa beet salad, italian panini, turkey panini and of course the mac and cheese.   Thank you so much Sauce!"}
{"text":"Great food, great wine selection, this new location is so nice and very well kept as far as cleanliness goes. I will definitely be coming back here to watch all my football games! The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"There is no such thing as great pizza in AZ.  This pizza is pretty good though... but it isn't REAL pizza.  Real pizza crust is not flaky pastry.  Flaky pastry tastes good, but it isn't real pizza.  REAL white pizza isn't devoid of garlic and other Italian flavors.  What i ate was good without traditional seasonings and garlic, but it wasn't pizza.  I couldn't even make excuses and say it was like real pizza in Italy because it wasn't, but it tasted good.  Beer selection wasn't bad.  They have options for a wide range of tastes.  I like the atmosphere.  It is casual cafeteria style, but the interior is very comfortably decorated for my taste.  Red(head) is my color and this place is shades of tomato and olive green.  Their chop salads are good too... but they aren't chopped.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"BEST Mac N Cheese ever!!! The sauce is so addicting."}
{"text":"Best place in Dana park. I come here for lunch 2-3 times a week. The service is always awesome. The food is reasonably priced and you can make a healthy choice. But even their not as healthy choice aren't too bad. Lunch dinner date you name it; sauce is a great choice. The tomato soup with the fresh dinner roll is my favorite combined with any of their salads."}
{"text":"I ordered the Suprema on thin crust and it was good!  This spot, just opened up recently, nice ambiance, sharp decor and friendly staff.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  My wife first took me here a while ago and I wasn't so sure, but she kept wanting to go, and I expanded my selections.  I've had a large number of their items.  Right now, my favorite is their baked beef lasagna.  I can't seem to get enough of it.  Their pizzas are really good.  The cheese pizza and the chicken w/ white sauce one (can't remember the actual names) are my two favorites.  As for sandwiches, I'm a big fan of the meatball, but I ask for it on the old style bread, just a regular bread that is used for panini instead of the more wrap like bread (I don't really know why they switched.)  The Caesar salad is good and the meat salad that isn't on the menu is excellent.  One mention, I don't know why, but I find the tea they make here is the best of any restaurant that I've gone to.  My wife always gets the Pasta, Chicken and Broccoli, without the broccoli.  It's alright, but I want something more exciting.  The staff is usually friendly, and certain members recognize us and talk about how big my son is getting.  It's really nice to be greeted like that."}
{"text":"Great tasting Suprima Pizza and Chicken salad!The $20 for two including drinks was great deal! Will definitely be going back for more great food and drink!"}
{"text":"Not to shabby at all, Sauce!  Love their exposed brick, wood floors, and big chalkboard menu on wall. Adequate seating inside or out. Quick and friendly service.  Had the Feta and Turkey Salad (hold the corn!) last Sunday afternoon. Was pretty scrumptious! My dining partners had thin-crust pizza that looked delish also.  I will def be back for more Sauce!"}
{"text":"I like this place for lunch.  Salad and pizza is a great combo before a 5 hour long shopping trip.  Yes, we waited in a long line, but that was good since I had a hard time deciding what I wanted.  Yes, I have had better pizza- but it was pretty good and I usually like to eat GREAT pizza when i can take time to enjoy it.  This place will get you in and out."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. We were trolling around scottsdale on july 4th and popped in because of yelp reviews. Total find. Food wad great. Redsauce pasta superb, mac and chee too good, super salad, and crazy good pizza. We will be back before heading back to socal."}
{"text":"Last night I ordered a artichoke and portobello mushroom pizza to go.  I was so disappointed when I got home to discover they were VERY skimpy with the toppings!  Seriously, only about and 1 1/2\" from the center had toppings, the rest was plain!  And, there should be at least one mushroom and artichoke on each piece and there was not.  VERY disappointing.  Come on you guys... don't be so skimpy!!!"}
{"text":"Upscale \"fast\" food.  We're creatures of habit and order the same meal during most visits. The macaroni and cheese, bruschetta and a mixed green salad and a few drinks. The salad and bruschetta are mostly consistent when ordering. The macaroni and cheese is never consistent. Sometimes the pasta is way over cooked other times just right. Sometimes the pasta swims in a runny cheese sauce, other times its coated just right. You never know.   We've been going to this location for little over a year now. It's conveniently located within walking distance of our house. Today was perhaps the first time we received friendly and fast service.  From the cashier to the person collecting our plates, everyone seemed friendly and happy to serve. It almost seemed weird because I've gotten used to the fairly crappy snotty behavior of the kids working there.    It was also the first time ever our whole meal was served within a few minute period. On all previous occasions, one dish would come out, then 20 minutes later another, and on many occasions you had to ask someone where your food was. Today, it was smooth running. Perhaps they did some much needed house-cleaning and hired new staff. Keep it up please!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this location was here and decided to go here for lunch over Panera today. I have three stars for many reasons. 1. First thing I noticed when I walked in was it was busy (expected) and none of the open tables were clean. I was unsure if I was gonna find anything. 2. I stood there for a while for my order to be taken and I was the only one in line. 3. I assume it was the manager, he was the only one in a button up shirt and not a panera one, he said come here in an attempt to help me. He spoke over me and was callous in my order taking.  4. Because it was fixed, this would only cause them 1 star loss, but I had a hair in my mac & cheese. I let someone know and they made it right immediately. It happens, I can forgive.   Overall, my Cesar salad was awesome and what I had of my mac & cheese was delicious. I always love the rolls as well. I'm not sure if I would come back but the 2nd person that helped me with my food was exceptionally nice."}
{"text":"Sauce has the best bruschetta in the valley! Also amazing salads and great lasagna."}
{"text":"I have been eating here a few times a month for the last two years. The food is always good and fresh, the staff is always nice and polite. I've never had a bad experience and will continue to eat here for lunch!"}
{"text":"I love Sauce, oh so much. Their food is always fresh and everything I have had there is AMAZING. They have great salads with large portions, their pasta dishes are to die for, and I always ask for an extra bread because its just really good.   Great place for a casual date night, girls night or just want to eat some good food!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday.  It was very crowded!  We were lucky enough to get outdoor seating though.  I ordered the caprese bruchetta and a side green salad.  The bruchetta was a little oily for me... also very garlicy.  If I were to go back, I think I would stick with a caprese salad or sandwich instead for those flavors. The salad was good too, pretty big and fairly plain.  My friends both got pizzas that they thought were excellent.  This is a great lunch place I would definitely revisit."}
{"text":"This review is going to be based solely on the service, as I looooove the pizza and salads here.   We went in this past Friday, they were busy but not jam packed, there were plenty of open tables.   There were 6 in our party. We ordered 5 pizzas and 2 salads.   4 pizza come out pretty quickly. As the waiter (Who looked like he might be the manager, as he had on a different shirt then the rest of the staff) went to give my little 13 year old cousin her pizza he full on hits her in the head with the pizza plate. She sits there stunned, says ouch, and is holding her head where he hit her. He doesn't even say sorry, instead he says \"Ive never seen that happen\" and WALKS AWAY. We were all kind of shocked, no sorry???   So 4 pizza are on the table. My mother in law had ordered her own pizza. It become obvious they forgot. We question them on it, the server mumbles something and then another 10-15 minutes go by and out comes her pizza, again no apology.   Ive never experienced service like this at any of the Sauce locations I've been to.   Come on Sauce, step it up."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of OK. Not great and not bad either. Good for a family, but not really a date place. If you want something hot, quick, low key and moderately tastey, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go and share a pizza with a friend since their \"personal\" size is perfect for two! I was basic and just tried their margarita pizza but it was so amazaing! I would absolutely recommend it to a friend!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried their pizza yet but I do love the pasta shells and meatball.  The side order is big enough for a meal for one. The atmosphere is casual, open, and airy. The staff is friendly and the location is ideal; near movie theater and shopping."}
{"text":"I have been to sauce many times and have rated it around 4.5. After not going many times, todays experience was quite different.   My friend and I split the chicken Caesar salad pizza and the chicken broccoli pasta (2 of my favorites that i recommended because she had never been to sauce before). The total was around $20, $26 with taxes and drinks.   We got our own drinks and found a seat. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. It wasn't difficult to find a seat but it was also a Monday afternoon so I imagine the place fills up quickly other times.   The ambience is great. It's very warm (not sure if that's the right word) ie the pizza oven, brick wall, and italian prints but also had a very modern vibe with it's chalkboard wall, clean finish, and high ceiling. Altogether the ambience ties together nicely and adds to a great dining experience.   After getting our drinks an sitting down, the food came out in under a minute!!! It was faster than fast food!   The food itself was five stars. The crust was thin, chewy, and supple which explains how they make it so fast. They changed how they make their Caesar salad pizzas and added a lot more asiago to their crust which really balances the flavors of the pizza. The salad on top was amazingly fresh, the dressing was homemade and robust, and the chicken too, was moist and flavorful. I personally think that the crust and salad must be eaten together which is a unique experience   The pasta was also delicious. The chicken and broccoli were cooked to perfection, the pasta was al dente, and the sauce was unlike any regular cheese sauce. Even the role that came with it was warm, chewy and homemade.   The service was 5 stars. We were constantly being checked on and although it was busy there were plenty of waiters and waitresses.   Eating here today was amazing and pretty much everything I've ever had here has been really delicious. Sauce puts a lot of thought in every single ingredient, and constantly works harder to create a better dining experience. And for around $10-$15 a person, you simply cannot beat it!  The only cons were: -Very loud (but that's what outdoor seating is for, right?) - there were no napkins (I had to ask the waiter to bring us some)"}
{"text":"First impression of sauce was great, love the kitchen and pizza oven set up and how open the place is. The menu had a great selection and the food was excellent. However, the service was not what I expected, aside from the girl at the register, the staff just stood there and did nothing besides talk. I had to go up to them 3 times let them know we were ready for the check...(bummed out) I have to give the establishment a 3 star, I would comeback but probably on a day where the staff is switched up. Still though the food was great."}
{"text":"Every weekend my husband and I love to go out on a date. It is our time to be alone, relax, and have a great time together. Our favorite thing to do on date night is to eat out at a restaurant we can both agree on. We decided to try a restaurant we have never been to which is called Sauce. I was very skeptical of this place because many Italian restaurants are very similar, boring, and bland. I realized I was very wrong from the moment I walked into the door. Sauce Pizza and Wine is an excellent choice to dine out because it is affordable, has great service, and serves fresh and tasty food.         One of the most common reasons my husband and I eat out only once a week is because the cost is so high. At the average restaurant our bill could easily be forty dollars not including the tip for just the two of us which is quite a bit of money for a family on a budget. When we eat at Sauce we know that we are getting the best quality food for the best price. There are many places that have low prices, but many of them do not have quality service like Sauce.      Exceptional service is a key element in choosing a restaurant and Sauce has it. As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted by smiling faces. They also waited patiently as we looked over the chalkboard menu on the wall. The line moves very quickly because the staff is very knowledgeable about their menu. After ordering, we went to find a clean table which was not difficult at all. Sauce routinely cleans all unoccupied tables to ensure that their new guests are able to sit down. Less than ten minutes later a server brought our food which was hot, fresh, and ready for us to eat.       Sauce has a variety of foods in which any person could find a dish to fall in love with. Most people come here for the pizza, but if you are on a healthy diet they have many delicious salads.  Each ingredient is listed in a way that demonstrates the zesty menu that Sauce provides.        Sauce is one of the best restaurants I have visited because the price is right, the service is exceptional, and the food is amazing. I have always felt that pizza was a food I ordered in at home because I was too lazy to make anything or did not want to wait around for a sit down meal at a restaurant. My view of pizza eateries has definitely changed because I know that Sauce is a place I can go for a quick and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Best service I have had in such a long time! Food was great! Good atmosphere! Must go here!"}
{"text":"We love SAUCE .  Ted and Chris along with entire staff were very accommodating to our football order. Not only did they donate a meal to our team of Football Players at CHAPARRAL but they sent delicious pizzas, red pastas with meatballs, white pasta, fantastic macaroni cheese, caesar salad, and homemade chocolate chip cookies!  SAUCE  ROCKS!!  Try it TONIGHT"}
{"text":"I ordered the pine nut salad, tomato soup and also have had the mac and cheese (kids size).  Everything was delicious! The location is in the middle of a strip mall (next to orange theory) which I think is a little crowded, however the ambiance inside is great!  They have eating outside as well if you would like."}
{"text":"They have gluten free items labeled on the menu, but even though they have a ton of veggie options, the vegetarian/vegan options are not labeled so we had to ask about everything and held up the line. If they had things labeled as vegan, they'd get 5 stars because the food and service was good and they were very accommodating regarding our \"allergies.\"  Order: Roasted winter vegetable salad, dressing on the side. No other changes. Quinoa, beet, & arugula salad with no goat cheese, and balsamic on the side. Build your own pizza, hand stretched crust, red sauce, olives, asparagus, and spinach. All vegan.  Tip: order extra red sauce if you get a pizza with no cheese.  The Roasted Winter Vegetable salad is almost exactly like True Food's autumn/winter salad - yum!"}
{"text":"Just felt compelled to write a quick review of Sauce. My company orders from here ALL the time, everything is always spot on as far as substitutions, correct orders, and anything extra that we might have requested.   I can really appreciate exceptional customer service and I was in there Tuesday around lunchtime and I completely forgot my wallet at the office, I offered to call in with the number or even use my husbands card over the phone but they don't have capability to do that so the manager just comped it - maybe she recognized me because I'm there weekly but it was very appreciative and it's rare to find companies that go above and beyond these days!"}
{"text":"Keeping in mind that Sauce is a chain, the pizza is pretty good.  In my opinion a thinner crust is the only way to serve pizza."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a coworker. Got the chicken and mozarella salad. VERY tasty, but small portion. They give you a roll in a bag, which was odd. $23 for 2 salads, so a little steep."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant! The new location on camelback just opened & the inside is so nice! Loved the pizza and the macaroni cheese. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Have noticed several of these in Phoenix area, but haven't tried until now. Just had a lemonade tea mix and was good. Pelligrino also. Have asked for a pasta dish of marinara. sausage, and chicken. And all was really good."}
{"text":"I had lunch with some friends today and it was a good experience.  I have been here several times and can share it has never been bad.  We had a party of 11 and the staff was very accommodating, helpful and customer service oriented.  A lot of times when you have large group restaurant employees get annoyed and are not very friendly.  In our case they were very attentive and helpful.   We sat outside and enjoyed the patio seating, but since it's mid December it was rather chilly, the gal who brought out our meals was very nice and asked if we would like the patio heaters on and started them up right away for us. Also while serving my beverage I had dropped my plastic cup before filling it, (thank goodness it was still empty!!!) the lady at the register proceeded to approach me with a new one before I could even make it to the register counter to ask for a replacement.  I was impressed!  They're on their game...  I had a spinach chicken apple salad and half a panini. The salad was extremely fresh and very flavorful.  The sandwich was very good as well.  I wouldn't say I love this place nor is it my favorite choice but it is a good pick if you are in the mood for some pizza, pasta or salad at a fair price while shopping or in the area.  Since they also serve an okay variety of wine it is also perfect for a  dinner quick bite if you are already in the area as a matter of convenience. In other words...I wouldn't ever drive out of my way to make a special trip for Sauce specifically.  Happy dining peeps! Ciao! :)"}
{"text":"Ahhh, another place that used to be great, but is now blahhhhhhhh.    We ate here many times in the past and the service, food, and cleanliness were always really good. But alas, once again another restaurant in Mesa that used to be good, is now a dive.    Come on Mesa - I am a longtime resident of the city and I'm getting sick and tired of the crappy offering of restaurants that we have here.   But let that go.  So let's start with the only good thing about this meal first, and that was the Spinach Apple Chicken salad.  We habitually order this every time that we go there and it is always good -and in this case they did not disappoint. However the portion was a tad smaller than what I recall in the past, but it was good overall.    But let that go.  So the wife is on this gluten free kick (like everyone else who has been duped into believing that gluten is bad) and she wanted to order the gluten-free pizza crust. And like a fool I caved in and ordered the gluten free crust. We ordered the Supremo Pizza,  and did I say it was on gluten free crust?  Well here is where the wheels came off the bus. The pizza came out lukewarm, the crust was as rigid as a rock, and while there were toppings on it, they were much sparse than I recall from the past. But it was the fact that it was lukewarm and rock-hard which was the biggest problem. In fact this pizza was so hard they couldn't even hack through it with their pizza slicers in the kitchen because I had to take out a chainsaw and hack up several of the pieces just so I could eat them.  Now granted I may own a little bit of this review for caving to the wife's to demands for gluten-free crust, but I would think that this place would have somehow determined or tested one of their gluten-free pizzas to see if it was even worthy of being served. This obviously was not and it was a huge blunder to even set this type of food before guests who are paying.  Lastly I just wanted to make this note but we did request two plates when the pizza came out and the server brought out to dripping wet plates that must have just came out of the dishwasher. And not only were they both dripping wet,  but one of them still had bits and pieces of food left on it and obviously their dishwasher is not working well. That kind of sent me into orbit because hey get your head out of your backside and at a minimum wipe the dishes off before you bring them out to me dripping nasty wet.    That in essence is just low-class service but that's becoming the norm in today's society I guess.  Anyway we're done with this place.   For some reason that song \"Another One Bites the Dust\" from the 1980's is going through my mind right now and I don't know why.    Well that and I have a little indigestion from the pizza."}
{"text":"I usually hit up Sauce for lunch once a month, and it's a decent choice overall.  Their salads are great, the chicken/pine nut one is my favorite. The pizza is also delicious and they have some great specialty pizzas. I personally like the chicken Caesar salad pizza. It's basically a garlic/cheese pizza with chicken Caesar salad on top! Best of both worlds!  On the negative side, the portions are okay, they have gotten smaller over the years, especially if you get take out salads. The places is usually really crowded especially during lunch and dinner rushes, so seating and parking can be kind of a pain."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken pine nut salad with a side of mac & cheese. Half of my macaroni was left without cheese, really disappointed especially for the prices here."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly, concerned and quick. Not a single bad thing to say about this place. Food is always fresh, made to order and delicious. Perfect lunch place, even during the lunch rush service is still great."}
{"text":"Great job! Get the lunch size macaroni and cheese with a pizza. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"The pizza and salad were delicious. They were seasoned well and just the right size. I will try a different pizza next time as I had the spicy chicken sausage. Very tasty! The fresh bread was hot and crisp. The star of the show, however, were the double chocolate chip cookies. I shared one with my daughter, immediately regretted it after my first bite. Better than my cookies and it takes a lot for me to say that because my cookies could win contests. Will definitely get my own cookie (cookies?) next time."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight and it was super yummy!! You can get half a salad if you'd like, which I did, and had the spinach, apple, and walnut salad, we ordered a side of mac and cheese for our son, and we had a mozzarella and basil pizza. Everything tasted fresh and homemade. The cheese on the mac and cheese was creamy, rich, and amazing. The service was great, food came out very quick, and the place was clean. We enjoyed sitting outside. We will be back again for sure. I really want to try the lasagna now!"}
{"text":"Always satisfied.  Pizza's are thin crust just like in Italy!"}
{"text":"Great date night with Michael.  We enjoyed the summer special, salad, pizza and wine for $20.  I LOVED the thin crust, it reminded us of our favorite pizza from LaMaddalena, Italy.  I suggest to offer red pepper/spicy oil to drizzle over the thin crust pizza.  That's what we remember from living in Italy, it's so yummy!  The artichoke and portobella mushrooms was delicious!"}
{"text":"I came into sauce today around 3pm and received the worst service ever. First I go up to the counter and ask do you guys have white pizza and all he said was yes and rang it in not even telling me what the pizza was! Then he dropped the food off and we asked for another bread for all our soup and he just nodded and walked away and never came back.. Then as we are finishing we ask the young girl for a box for our pizza and she never came back just stood up front talking to her coworkers.. Really disappointing this place has great food and terrible employees."}
{"text":"I ordered a mozzarella, fontina and basil pizza to go and when I came home the pizza had no basil! Get the orders right. The most simple order and they couldn't get that right. Won't go back to that location if they can't get a simple order right."}
{"text":"Even though I don't dine here nearly as often as my taste buds would like, I love Sauce! The handful of times I've been here, I've never had anything to complain about. I've had a few different menu items, namely, chicken/pine nut salad, chicken/spinach/apple salad, chicken/broccoli pasta, chicken/broccoli pizza and nothing has ever disappointed. Right now they have their summer special: one pizza, one salad, two glasses of wine for $20. Such a delicious deal!"}
{"text":"After driving around with our Realtor all morning, it was lunch time and she had never been to Sauce. Since we were by there, we stopped in for lunch and split a Cesear salad, my wife, daughter and realtor ordered Pepperoni and Crimini Mushroom pizza and I had the Salami, Turkey, Prosciutto & Mozzarella Panini sandwich. It was excellent, just the right amount of food for lunch."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet. We order a couple salads with chicken to go and one salad comes without chicken. My wife calls and asks if they could re make one with chicken. The manager says \" Come on back and we will have one for you\". We go to grab it real quick and they make an even bigger salad and give her a free salad on her next order! I'm in customer service and this how it should be. Way to go Sauce!!"}
{"text":"I had heard about the mac n cheese here and ordered that as a meal.  While most restaurants serve up a watered down, unseasoned version of M&C Sauce delivers.  The flavor and cheese thickness were spot on. The best is that while I made my way through the bowl the cheese didn't start to settle.  Amazing from start to finish.  I want to try it with the meatballs next time!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their Kale and Salmon salad. Obsessed.  Yes, I've had a Panini and pizza here and there and they were good, really.  then I got the kale and salmon salad.  I no longer care about anything else.     I've tried to replicate this salad because really, it's pretty simple as far as ingredients go:  kale, romaine hearts, currants, cashews, (farro I leave out b/c I have no idea where to get it), and salmon.  See, simple.    Two things:  the dressing and the salmon are what set it over the edge. The champagne vinaigrette is outstanding.  Side note:  they sometimes allow you to buy a cup of salad dressing to go.   The salmon.  I don't are what I do, I can't replicate the richness of their salmon.  I just can't.    I have a sneaking suspicion that they do something bad to their salmon, like cook it in a stick of butter, to get it that rich and delicious.  I don't EVEN want to know.  All I know is, that salad is goooooooo-ooood.  And, in total is $11.  DEAL!  Oh, service is always great whether you dine in or carry out."}
{"text":"I first tried this place when I was studying at the UofA and I'm glad they have a location here in Scottsdale.  Personally, I prefer deep dish Chicago-style pizza but Sauce has helped me gain more of an appreciation for thin crust as well. I've had both the portobello/artichoke and the sausage/pepperoni pizza and both are quite tasty."}
{"text":"Very slow, unorganised and pricy for pasta and lettuce.  Different since FOX sold them."}
{"text":"Morgan took our order,  and she couldn't be any better or sweeter.   She was amazing.   The Italian chopped salad was wonderful and the Supreme pizza with the thicker crust was the best.   Thank you Sauce for an amazing time and great food. Again,  Morgan was great!!?"}
{"text":"I wanted to thank, and commend Cameron, the General Manager, at this location.  I eat at many of the Sauce Pizza restaurants and they are excellent.  Cameron is always so nice when I come in and he always comes over to say \"hi\" and help me with ordering.  I am vegan and he has been very helpful on several occasions.  The employees are very nice and the food is great.  Cameron does an excellent job of managing this restaurant.  He is very aware of everything that occurs within the restaurant and is very involved in working orders so the quality and efficiency is always top notch.  You can tell he enjoys his job and it is evident in how friendly the staff always is.  If any vegans are looking for an outstanding pizza, order the wild mushroom pizza with no cheese.  It is so good.  Thanks Cameron for the excellent service and food and please let the employees know I appreciate all of their kindness and service as well.  And lastly, the owner of the Sauce Pizza restaurants is very nice as well.  I forgot his name but he is a very nice guy that knows who to hire to manage his restaurants."}
{"text":"I was in for pizza today at the camelback location.  I go in often and I wanted to share how great the employees are at this location.  Laura is the manager at this Sauce and every time I come in she is always smiling and always says hi.  She does an outstanding job of managing the business.  You can tell the employee's are very happy and it shows in how nice they are with the customers.  They all are very knowledgeable of the menu and offer suggestions.  Another employee that I want to commend is Ryan.  Most times when I go in, Ryan is at the register.  Ryan always waves as soon as I walk in the door and always says \"would you like the usual\"?  He is always happy and is always very polite.  Employees like Ryan keep people coming back.  He is excellent at his job and he makes it very enjoyable to everyone when they come in.  I doubt you could find someone that is better at their job.  When he is not taking orders he is always ensuring that the pizzas are being delivered quickly.  Besides the fact that the vegan version of the wild mushroom pizza is the best I have ever had, Ryan and Laura make it fun to go into the restaurant.  They are so good at their jobs that you would believe they are the owners.  That is how much they care about customer service.  There is also a young man, that I wish I had gotten his name as well, that is always nice.  He has black hair and often brings out the pizzas.  He is always so nice and great too.  I will have to check on his name so I can update this so he gets recognition.  But everyone there is great.  Laura does a great job of picking employees.  For anyone thinking about pizza, you won't find a better pizza or better service than Sauce.  One last person I want to thank is the owner.  I've only talked to him on the phone but he is a great guy.  His restaurants are always busy and it's because he puts a lot of effort into making them great."}
{"text":"I have to say that I had the best experience at Sauce that I have had in a long time.   We used to frequent Sauce quite a bit, but lost interest in the past year or so, when their food seemed to have changed and their portions were altered.   Once in a while I try them with the hope that I will once again be happy. Tonight, was that night. The food was fabulous, but what made the restaurant shine was the staff. Everyone that I interacted with seemed to really care about their job and truly wanted to give the best customer service.   I will be back, this time I won't wait for long. Way to go Sauce"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has a three star rating overall, unless people expect something crazy awesome.  This is one of the Fox Restaurant Concepts and in my opinion, it's the best.  (Although I do enjoy the asparagus at North!)  I've only eaten in here once or twice at most maybe.  Most times I'm just picking up to go on the way home.  I love the \"Pasta, Chicken and Broccoli\".  It's just the right size portion and despite being pasta with a cream sauce I never feel like it's too heavy.  If you're looking for quick food for the family this place is a great alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"I'm overdue to give Sauce my five stars, since I've been riding my bicycle twenty miles once per week for the past two years just to eat lunch there.  Yes, there's one in the Scottsdale waterfront district that's closer, and the food is just as good, but the patio at Thunderbird Square is less hassle.  I could eat the rosemary and potato pizza every time.  Who would think? Don't snicker till you've tried it.  It's the olive tapenade that gives it the great flavor, and the thin crust adds just the right crunch and cheeziness, and ensures that the wait is short.  But I also like the portobello and artichoke just as well, and you can get it as either a pizza or a bruschetta.  I also can't resist the sausage and caramelized onion.  Another dark horse which I've grown to love is the prosciutto and melon.  The cool, thin melon slices on top are great on a hot day."}
{"text":"Had some gift cards for here so decided to use one. Pizza was a good shareable size, but tried a spinach and pepperoni pizza and the spinach was bad, I was actually sick all day after having it last night."}
{"text":"I've always loved Sauce! Every location I go to is always decent but I really enjoyed my meal here the other day for a couple reasons. I struck up a small conversation with the cashier who I suspected to be the manager. I ordered my food and told him I would definitely be wanting a box later on. He told me he was and he hoped that I would enjoy my meal. The salad came out first, the chicken and pine nuts salad is my absolute favorite. All the ingredients were fresh and the amount of dressing was perfect. I ordered a pizza and it was dropped off to my on a plate about 10-15 minutes after I ordered. Not soon after it was dropped off, the manager came by with two different box options. I was pleasantly surprised that he remembered our conversation from earlier.  I took the pizza home to-go.  That small amount of thoughtfulness really impacted my experience here ! I'll come back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Wild mushroom and fig pizza was exceptionally lovely. I skipped the arugula. Crust is quite good, nearly as close to true Italian as you can get in the US. Keep up the great work, and I will be ordering this regularly. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Sauce today because I couldn't find \"Nando's\" (across the street, I found it when i left) , I was really hungry and lazy to drive across Baseline.  So, first timer to Sauce and the Manager/Owner?? asked if we have been before..and since we weren't he went on and on and on about how to get the best deal...sounded like i was buying a car.  I quickly said \"great\" and forgot everything he told me.  I ordered the Summer Special...Salad, Pizza, and 2 glasses of wine.  Pancetta, Goat Cheese and Spinach salad was good, really light and fresh tasting.  The Sausage and Carmelized onions pizza was good but the Sausage was exactly like Tony's pizza in your grocers freezer section...THE EXACT SAME FLAVOR, SAME LOOK, SAME evertyhing...it took a really good light pizza and made it taste like Tony's frozen pizza.  So, don't order the sausage anything pizza (unless u like little rat droppings on your pizza).  So Sauce was decent, wouldn't make a habit of going but decent"}
{"text":"The perfect place to get a good lunch when on a shopping adventure at fashion square. You are in and out relatively quickly. I love their salads! The patio is also a delightful place to sit when lunching and catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Love Sauce as a casual lunch spot.  Their pizzas are delicious, using fresh ingredients.  We also love the caprese salad, the dressing is a great balsamic vinaigrette.  The Snoqualmie Riesling is a favorite.  We've also had some of their salads and their bruschettas are tasty too."}
{"text":"Sauce may not have the absolute best pizza in the valley, but it's certainly up there!  We started with a chicken, pine nuts, tomato and gorgonzola salad.  Heavenly.  The salad was not too heavily dressed, and the cheese really complimented it quite well.  The salad itself is big enough for two people to split, and comes with a roll.  If it were my meal alone, I would've been quite satisfied.  We also had the rosemary potato pizza.  Very thinly sliced potatoes, spinach, feta, and some sort of olive mixture.  It was a little tangy and oily, but everything tasted so fresh and come together quite nicely.  Whomever created this pizza knew what they were doing.  Sauce is not really making a big deal about it, but there's now a thicker wheat crust available.  It's still quite thin, crunchy and delicious.  In addition to salads and pizza, sauce offers paninis and pastas.  It's a semi-service order at the register and your food is brought to you style.  This location gets quite busy during lunch, but only gets a small dinner crowd on off nights.  Prices may seem a little high, but the portions are perfect, and quality is fantastic."}
{"text":"I went to Sauce for the second time on a recent Friday night.  This was my first time at the Norterra location and the first time in several years since I've been there.    The ordering process is similar to Pei Wei, menu boards on the wall as you are in line, with a couple of registers at the front.  The line was short, so we were ordering in no time after we decided.  We chose to share a mozzarella/fontina/basil pizza and chicken/pine nuts/tomato/ gorgozola salad.  The restaurant was crowded, but fortunately we spotted someone leaving as we were searching for a seat, so we didn't have to look outside.  We sat down, and I went to get our drinks.  This is one area where the design of the restaurant is a bit of a cluster, walking to and from the beverage station over our entire visit, I almost ran into (or was almost run into) by employees coming out of the kitchen area.  Luckily, no incidents occurred, so it wasn't a big deal.  The salad came out pretty quickly and was good.  The chicken was especially tasty, though I didn't have too much, as I was saving room for the pizza, which came out a reasonable amount of time later.  I enjoyed the pizza very much, the flavor was quite good.  I liked it so much that I had five of the eight slices!  My only minor quibble would be that the middle of the pizza didn't have the same crisp as most of the rest of the pizza.  Overall though, very good.  We enjoyed Sauce.  The food was good and was a nice value (we had a free salad with pizza purchase coupon).  Solid four stars, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Quality food and good service!  My favorite is Sauce's sausage and pepperoni pizza, with red peppers, onions and mushroom.  Definitely a gourmet pizza with quality ingredients.  Although it's a small 12 inch thin crust pizza, it is satisfying and has a freshness unlike the typical heavy pizza you find at other chains.  The vegetable chopped salad is served in a generous-sized bowl.  I like the light dressing and crisp bite size veggies.  You order at the counter and your meal is brought to your table.  The servers are attentive and check to see if you need anything. This service always earns them a tip by my appreciative lunch buddy.  I look forward to a future lunch at Sauce!"}
{"text":"Food was a solid 4/5, staff is great, they serve booze at a decent price throughout the day (aww, yea!),   My friend and I split a salad and a pizza about 2 weeks ago which was really great!  ....Then, last week, we had an office party with food catered from this location.  I want to be honest with you all:  DO NOT GET THE THIN CRUST......   I tried the Pesto Chicken Pizza with thin crust and the crust was basically like a crisp (Which I am not a fan of... If I wanted a one-sided quesadilla, I would spent $5 at Fredericos).  My side salad was good and THE BRUSCHETTA IS FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!  I do recommend going to this location, getting some booze and amazing bruchetta..... for that, I thank you!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a gluten free salad and it came with a crouton in it which got me really sick. The salad was also pretty much inedible with awful chicken and dressing.  But I would come again for the gluten free pizza!"}
{"text":"It's fine... nothing special. For some reason my brethren from the Valley of the Sun were huge fans, don't get it, won't be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch on a busy Sunday with friends.  (Tip:  Get there early to get a seat!)   The menu is loaded with nice pizza creations, as well as soup and nice salads.  We tried the Caprese Skewers and they were fresh and tasty.  The tomato soup was amazing and fresh, just wish the bread that came with it was something more special than a basic dinner roll.  The pizzas were amazing and filling!  Pesto was outstanding and so was the spicy chicken sausage!  Overall, it was a decent visit!  Service was friendly and helpful too."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Sometime the service is slow especially during peak times. However the food is always hot. Never had a bad Meal."}
{"text":"Sauce is a great Quick Serve place.  I had the Chix Caesar Salad it was large and filling and quite good.  The sangria is nice as well...I like the koolaid touch around the edge of the glass.  My man had the bruchetta caprese style and it was awesome...the tomatoes were perfectly ripe and the mozzarella was fresh and creamy.  The bread was a really crusty yet fluffy yet able to hold up to the mix piece of wonder...we found out they get it from LaBrea.  If you want a great quick lunch or dinner check it out...we look forward to trying the pizza and pasta next time!"}
{"text":"Sauce is just my pace. It's a relaxed atmosphere where you order the food from a counter and it is brought to your table when it is ready. They offer pizza, tasty salads, panini's, and pastas. I have only tried the pizza and salads, but I have been very happy with both. They also have a huge selection of wines to choose from.  The pizzas do somewhat remind me of Italian pizza, just a crisper crust. They have some very unique pizza flavors at Sauce. Last time I ate there we tried the  Rosemary potato, spinach, feta, and olive pizza. I was a bit hesitant about the potatoes, but it turned out to be really good.   I have to admit Sauce was a bit over hyped, but still the food is good and I really like the relaxed atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Walk-up counter, friendly staff w/ suggestions ready.  I came in stil unsure as to where I was going to have dinner- Olive & Ivy or Sauce?  One manager already had me pegged for a Spinach, Pancetta, and Goat cheese salad.  He was right, since it was pretty much the only salad I'd choose, mostly bec. many of the other choices contained allergens.  Meatballs were calling my name as well, so I chose to order the salad ($6.50), plus chicken ($2), and a side of one meatball ($1).  Paid and took my tag number to a booth.    Salad, w/c glistened beautifully dressed w/ a balsamic vinaigrette, came topped w/ what looked like a teaspoon of lightly toasted pancetta and a tablespoon of crumbled goat cheese.  Chicken was missing, but was quickly brought to the table- about a quarter-cup, shredded, served cold in a dipping bowl.  In another dipping bowl sat my one lone meatball and a little dollop of red sauce.  I savored this little morsel w/ the dinner roll that came w/ the salad.  (The meal would have been perfect had the dinner roll been toasted crusty and warm!)  Aside from the counter and barstool dining area, the rest of the restaurant made me feel like I was eating at a cafeteria, w/c didn't lend any pizazz to my dining experience.  However, this speedbump won't keep me from returning to try other dishes (and more of those luscious meatballs!)."}
{"text":"Really nice place, a tad small but not crowded today. The pizza was pretty okay. The crust was too thin and really crunchy plus a couple burnt parts. I didn't like how little cheese there was on the pizza. I also would like to see pizza of different sizes. The soda fountain stuck and wouldn't quit pouring soda (Pepsi products btw). Overall, it was okay. Not really a place that stood out from the others I've been too."}
{"text":"This place was busy. Four of us were in our party. Food came out fast.  My order cup of soup and a pizza. Hatch Chile and pepperoni.  It was a ten. You have to try it. The soup tasted like it was half salt. They quickly brought me tamatoe soup out. That was really  good. Nice place to sit outside."}
{"text":"Love this place! Quick and easy, take away or stay and dine! Amazing concept! Been coming here for years. The hardest thing to do is decide what to eat, it's all awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sauce at Norterra a few time before and always had a good experience.  We recently came here during a Friday night car show.  Wow this place was really busy, and we were lucky that we came right before the rush!    Sauce is a restaurant where you stand in line to order, then you get a number and the food is brought out to you.  I actually like restaurants like this when I'm in a hurry or don't feel like being served at the table.  We ordered a salad with apple, chicken and walnuts it to start. It came to our table before our pasta and it was very good.  We also ordered Mac and Cheese with Chicken  added. I enjoyed it very much but the wife didn't think it was much.  I did notice that chicken was a little dry and hard..it seemed old to me.  I've had the chicken and Mac before and it came out better before.  I would have complained if we were not in a hurry so I just ate it.  Not totally satisfied.   Anyways ill come back here for one more time to give a final rating.  I would like to rate it 4 stars but it was a little hard to do with my last taste with chicken.  I wont totally write off Sauce just yet though!"}
{"text":"Our order taker/cashier was kind of rude. There wasn't anyone behind us but she was very impatient. They now leave the silverware in a bucket on the table. This is so unsanitary.  People coughing and talking now ver the silverware. Kids could be playing with it. Who knows what's on it. One of our orders was not right and im pretty sure the cooks just removed some of the salad and added stuff rather than remake the order as is what should be done. We rarely have a poor experience here so I'm going to assume this was a fluke and will return but info feel it has gone a little downhill since Fox sold it."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate have eaten here a few times, and we've always had excellent service. I love that they offer Kale Salads now and that alone deserves four stars.  I've never tried any of their pizzas, so I can't comment on the quality or the pizza tastes. I've always gravitated towards the salad selection. I don't care what other yelpers say! 4 Stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"I should have run once I saw they had pepsi.. I ordered a kids cheese pizza for my daughter and asked to add olives, she said \"we can't do that\" I laughed and repeated It back to her, \" You can't add olives to my kids pizza?!? \" she said \"Nope\" So I asked for a side of olives, she said \"OK\". Then I ordered a glass of wine for my wife, they poured It handed it to me, then told me I can't sit on the patio, where my family was sitting. What......? ( the order lady was very apologetic ) but still..maybe put up a sign? Pizza was soggy and under cooked. No flavor. My daughter enjoyed her cheese pizza with olives on the side.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"When Sauce first opened a while back, I wasn't a huge fan....until I discovered their AMAZING macaroni and cheese that is! Whenever I am in the mood for some comfort food (which usually means macaroni and cheese) I always think of Sauce. It is perfect. I usually like to pair it with their caesar salad. I haven't tried much else here, but I am not a fan of their pizzas. Doesn't mean they aren't good, just not for me!"}
{"text":"This was my second attempt at Sauce and unfortunately it did not get any better for me. The first time I came in I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and found it to lack flavor, my friend enjoyed her salad though. Came in again today and shared the meatball bruschetta, sausage and pepperoni pizza with sautéed onion, and a pizza cookie. The meatball bruschetta again lacked flavor and spice. The pizza had thinly crumbled sausage which is disappointing knowing Schriner's is local and would have made a big difference. For some reason the sauce or one of the ingredients had a fishy taste, we tried the toppings individually but couldn't identify what was giving off the flavor. Based on these two experiences I can't see myself coming back to Sauce."}
{"text":"My entire family LOVES Sauce. The pizza is always delicious and they have an amazing selection of healthy and fresh salads. We really like everything they have to offer. This is why when my brother asked (trying to conserve costs for his wedding) if we would host his rehearsal dinner at our home, I suggested Sauce for the catering.  Sauce did not disappoint! We ordered a few different pasta dishes, including lasagna, and two different salads for approximately 40 people. Everything was FLAWLESS!  Cameron, David and their staff made sure that our orders were sufficient for the number of guests that we were having, walked us through the ordering process and they went out of their way to make sure that we had enough serving utensils, salad dressings, rolls and butter. The order was ready on the day exactly at the time promised and we brought everything home and easily got everything set out to serve our guests. Most importantly, EVERYTHING was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! All of our guests loved the food, commented on how fresh it all was, asked where it was from and enjoyed the evening! There were barely any leftovers!  Believe me when I say that we will DEFINITELY use this Sauce again for any catering needs that arise! If you have the chance to have Cameron, David and their team prepare the food for your next event, I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. The food is fresh, healthy, delicious and affordable. This was a big success! A big thank you to the entire Scottsdale Sauce Team!"}
{"text":"Great service dedpite it being very busy at 2:00 on a Friday afternoon. This was my first visit to this restaurant but I will be back. I had the turkey and salami pannini with chips -  it was very good. You do not have a dedicated waiter so you can leave a small tip if you would like and it's serve yourself on the drinks."}
{"text":"Sauce is great. The pizza are perfect for lunch. They come in one size with a few topping combinations ranging from traditional (pepperoni/mushroom) to original (proscuetto/melon). They offer solid salads and paninis, but missing out on the pizza is a mistake.  Prices range from $8-12. Seating is sometimes tight."}
{"text":"Fantastic. This pizza place has unique types of pizza and it's sensational. The ambience is great. The servers were friendly. We got the chicken pesto pizza the server suggested and loved it."}
{"text":"So many choices! Now I'm not saying their pizza is east coast fabulous, but it's pretty darn tasty. They also have a good amount of salads to choose from. My all time favorite is the chicken, spinach, walnut. YummmmEeee! The dressing isn't too heavy. The spinach is always fresh and the chicken succulent. It's also a great place to bring kids. I take my nieces here all the time. They have a kid menu and even a beer and wine menu for the over 21 crowd. I've never had to wait too long for service. The staff is awesome. And again, it warrants mentioning again... Great place to bring the kiddos!!!"}
{"text":"The best food ever ! Come here all the time it's fast and affordable and amazing ! Their mac and cheese is on point and so is their Cesar salad. Also their Cesar pizza and potato pizza is great too. Love their bread rolls !"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing. The staff was not the best but wasn't horrible either. The only thing I would change is their seating. The chairs are very hard and little. My booty kept going numb throughout dinner lol :)"}
{"text":"Really like this place. Pizza, salad, soup, and bread is all great.  The pizza cookie is great also. The pasta is pretty basic. They have a really good summer special where you get a salad, pizza, & 2 glasses of wine."}
{"text":"First visit to Sauce ever! Great food, great staff. I had an Italian sandwich, loved the peppers, and my mother had pasta. We were both impressed (and full). Customer service was amazing too, the woman that took our order was a doll and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and excellent sauces are the stars at this restaurant. We ate here for lunch and in addition to the indoor seating, there is an outdoor patio for al fresco dining.  After browsing through the menu, I decided on the meatball panini. The order came out quickly, but I was surprised to see that the sandwich was placed in a thin, folded over pita-like bread rather than a thicker panini bread. Since it was only folded over and thin it was hard to eat it without the meatballs falling out of the sandwich. Additionally, the sandwich came with a marinara dipping sauce. The sauce itself was superb but any attempts to dip the sandwich in the sauce also resulted in the meatballs rolling out of the sandwich.   The actual ingredients were good though. The meatballs were hearty with good flavor, and the thin bread was nicely toasted.  If I eat here again I probably won't be getting the meatball panini, but perhaps another lunch item will be less unwieldy to eat!"}
{"text":"Sauce is one of my go-to restaurants. Lately my orders have been messed up and I haven't had the best experience but I always come back because I love this restaurant. I give this 4 stars because that last 2 times I've gone , they have done a really great job at getting my order correct and they're very nice!! Keep it up :)"}
{"text":"The chef robert is awesome. He was very nice to my autistic child. He even made him a gluten free dessert just for him. Very nice staff. We plan on coming back again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on my 20th birthday and they gave us a free dessert if we signed up with alerts with an email!  I ordered The Italian Panini, my cousin had the Quinoa salad (not sure what it was called), and my other cousin actually ordered a pesto pasta (not on the menu, they basically take mac and cheese pasta and put pesto in it instead). My panini was good, but it was better refrigerated when I got home and got to add ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise and all that! ;p   I loved the banana peppers in the panini. My cousin's salad was alright, I'm not a huge fan of quinoa so I didn't care for it much but my cousin didn't like it too much- she didn't finish it or bother packing it to take home.   My other cousin finished her pesto salad, I tried some and initially I thought it was bland but she gave me another part of it which was super flavorful, so just make sure to mix it evenly throughout.   We got the pizza cookie for our free dessert and they used a vanilla gelato on top of our chocolate chip cookie that wasn't cooked in a little pan. It was delicious. Great service, as well. The food is delivered to your table and all the workers come up to check on you even though it almost is self-serve.   Had a great first time at sauce and the staff were patient and initiated conversation. The prices aren't too bad either. My panini was $8 but I can't remember the rest of the bill because I didn't pay attention, haha."}
{"text":"Used to love the pizza and pasta at this place. Lately the service has been poor and the pasta has been watery. The restaurant is always busy whenever I go, the workers must be in such a rush to make the food that it hasn't been turning out right. Hopefully they get their food back to the quality that it was before. Disappointed for now..."}
{"text":"Food was ok, wine was ok, service leaves a lot to be desired.   The whole meal was pretty \"blah\" nothing stood out as amazing, but the biggest issue was nearly every table was both dirty and empty. We were there for maybe 40 minutes and no one cleaned any tables, it was disgusting."}
{"text":"Sauce was good, pasta was ok. For such a swank place it didn't deliver what I expected."}
{"text":"Huge fan! One of the better gluten free crusts I've found. The mushroom with arugula is my fave -- the hubs gets a meaty normal crust pizza and loves it. Service is always great and quality is consistent."}
{"text":"This sauce really disappointed me tonight.   I had guests and we ordered Grubhub delivery from sauce.   Delivery was on time and food of course was good.    The problem was that our dessert wasn't delivered.   When I called the store I was told by the manager Justine that I was basically out of luck.  There was no way to fix the mistake except to refund my money.   I didn't want a refund we wanted our dessert.   She scoffed at me and said I'm sorry that's all I can do.   Well for one, how about being truly sorry instead of trying to get your customers off the phone because you are 'in the middle of dinner rush'?   Although a sauce long time fan- I will not be back.   In store or delivery that attitude soured me for good."}
{"text":"Quick and easy spot to grab a quick lunch. I have had their Broccoli and chicken pasta and their winter salad. Both were good. I love that they bring you a roll when you eat there.   I absolutely love their triple chocolate chip cookie. It Caramelizes to a nice crisp."}
{"text":"Great place for a vegetarian! I love their salads and the bruschetta. The salads are full of a mix of fresh veggies and good flavors. They have big chocolate chip cookies at the counter, buy one or three because they are delicious! The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch with my neighbors and first time trying out Sauce. The pizza would get 4-5 stars! Very tasty and feels like a lighter style pizza with thin crust. Smart style of ordering at the counter and delivery to the table. Also love they over a Cabernet that offers 50% proceeds to autism.. made me feel better about wine at lunch! Also ordered the veggie salad- it is pretty delicious! I would ask for dressing on the side next time, as it was pretty drenched. Patio sitting is decent too."}
{"text":"EAT AT SAUCE!!!   The service is fast and friendly and the food is great! I love the spinach, pancetta and goat cheese salad. I always say I'm going to get something new, but I never do. I try my friends' pizzas though, and those are good too."}
{"text":"This place has been around for years and I can't believe I have overlooked it for so long. I took my son and a friend on Sunday and I had a roasted winter vegetable salad that I fell in love with. Perfectly roasted Brussels sprouts, squash, cauliflower, cranberries and walnuts in a light vinaigrette. So good on its own, but I added chicken and it was all the mire delicious. I thought about that salad all week so I went back today and ordered it again. I'll probably be back in a few days!"}
{"text":"Just to be clear, when they say a side of meatballs, pasta and red sauce, they really mean pasta with red sauce and a meatball."}
{"text":"I am very picky about salads since most salads I had from restaurants have been very flavorless or the veggies were sub-par.  I went to Sauce today with high expectations...a good salad.  I ordered the Chicken Pinenut Salad which was great.  The workers were courteous, and it did not take too long to get my salad.    On my next trip to Gilbert, AZ I plan to pay them another trip and try one of the pizzas."}
{"text":"I love this place so much I've got my family and bfs family hooked! So hard to try anything new so I'm not going to lie I've only had the spaghetti, pepperoni n sausage pizza, and the chicken Caesar. It's really good especially for the price"}
{"text":"Great service! I placed a phone order and when i collected my pizza it had onions on instead of garlic. Scott immediately refunded my money, got a new pizza made for me and and even said I could take the wrong pizza home too. Great customer service and great pizza!"}
{"text":"Just finished up lunch here with my girlfriend a little while ago and it was amazing! You order at the counter and then pick your own seat and they bring you the food when it's ready. We ordered the lasagna thin crust pizza and we cleared the whole pizza. It was amazing! Perfectly cooked, crunchy thin crust, and an incredible taste. They have beer and wine as well which goes great with pizza. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  We love it so much we eat there at least once a week.  Everything on the menu is good, and there is a wide variety of entrees.  The pizzas are around $10 and can easily feed two.  Salad portions are ample as well.  You really can't go wrong here.  The only downside is that it can get quite busy and can be difficult to find a seat.  That being said, it still doesn't deter us."}
{"text":"Lots of veggie options and gluten free crust. Great selection of beverages to compliment the food."}
{"text":"First & Last time eating and ordering takeout from this place (which was highly recommend by a friend) Mac N Cheese $7.75, Roasted Vegetable gluten free Salad w/Champagne dressing $8.00, Pizza Cookie w/Ice Cream $6.00. The price was great! the quality food negative :(  I really, really tried my best to hold myself back from not calling but, my food was getting worse by the bite. Roasted Vegetable Salad had raw squash and the dressing was honey mustard (The manager said it was fully roasted and the base of the dressing was honey mustard, because he personally brought it from the kitchen and bagged it up). My Mac N Cheese was missing mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. The manager said he was looking at my order and told me, I ordered the regular Mac N Cheese (which is priced at $4.50) now, unless my receipt and bank account are deceiving me; I clearly paid $7.75. My last straw, that made me call was, my burnt Pizza Cookie. He took the cookie off my receipt; but it won't erase the fact of how much justification he put on my incorrect order. Giving this place a try, I say go in person but for me, I will pass and will NOT recommend eating here. Too much hassle for a simple dish."}
{"text":"I really like Sauce, but this wasn't the best experience I've had. They brought all our food out separately. Which would be fine, except my food took twenty minutes longer than everyone else's. Then, when I received my food, it was completely burnt. How it even left the kitchen like that, I do not know... So I reluctantly brought the pizza to a server. She was apologetic and said she would get me a new one right away. The manager saw is talking and came over. She looked at the food and took it away without saying anything to me. 25 minutes later. (Almost an hour after everyone else got their food) I finally got my food. The manager never said anything to me even after I asked for a Togo box."}
{"text":"No menus, just what's on the chalkboard in the hallway leading to the cash registers? So you can't see the menu while ordering!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch place!! Great salads, pizzas,pasta, appetizers. Bruchetta is hard to beat on the most deliecious bread. Thin crust pizzas are great, with some really unique toppings.  Have always had great service and the manager is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza...we had 2 for 4 ppl with a salad...plenty! The best was the lasagna pizza with tossed crust which had deep flavor yumm. The other pizza was half ckn pesto n half sausage and carmelized onions with thin crust so good! Great arugula n beet salad completed a fab fast dinner. Oh we had some special pizza n bottle wine for $30 on Sat nites. Good service and used our Yelp 10% off."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to eat here a few days ago, the food was amazing, the service was so friendly but we both actually wound up getting food poisoning and it ruined our two year anniversary plans. Although the food may taste good, BEWARE! You may regret it later....we will never be returning."}
{"text":"Upscale fast food (think Pei Wei). Order at the counter, they cook it fresh and bring it to your table. The pizza crust is ultra thin, the ingredients fresh, the service quick.   I had the pepperoni and mushroom pizza, spinach and goat cheese salad and mac and cheese. It was a good meal and a great price (they have excellent iced tea too)."}
{"text":"Service and consistency has improved since my negative review I felt the need to update."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but it was quite a let down.  Friendly staff but a few major flaws will keep me from going back.  Wife ordered a salad, I a pizza with plans to share both.  After receiving two glasses of wine at the counter and taking back to our table my wife's salad showed up almost at the same time.  Because we were both hungry I insisted she put manners aside and eat while I waited for my pizza.  Glad she did because my pizza took a standard 15 minutes, was she supposed to let her salad sit while we waited for the hot food?  I am forgetting the one piece of bread that showed up haphazardly 5 minutes in, quite humorous actually.  Once the pizza finally arrived it was either undercooked or a bad crust recipe.  The pizza had no structure and needed to be held with two hands to keep from severe sagging.  Pizza was going to be the main driver for me but no thank you if it has the rigidity of cooked spaghetti.  Just bummed out.  $35 for a salad, pizza, and 2 glasses of shotty wine where you make your orders at a cash register.  This is the same money as any of several sit down restaurants in downtown Phoenix for which there is no comparison.  I will need to continue to make the drive...  Staff was very friendly however!"}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a couple of dishes here. We got the Italian sausage pizza and kale and pear salad. The pizza tasted so fresh and delicious, I didn't feel weighed down or in a carb coma. The salad was big and delicious and had a generous helping of greens which I am appreciative of. It was quite clearly a popular spot with the teenagers, so just make sure to get here a little after 6 and not much later, otherwise you're running into that crowd. Overall very good and I can't wait to bring my kids here."}
{"text":"We really liked this place! In town for a few days, I was in the mood for a good salad and nice glass of wine. The reviews on here were mixed, but decided to go for it anyway. I had the caprese salad and my husband had the spinach, chicken and apple salad. It was not a classic caprese, more like a green salad with mozzarella and tomatoes, but it was really good, and I particularly enjoyed the grilled croutons.   It was so yummy we went back a second time to try their pizza. It was equally good. Their staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, and our pup enjoyed the dog friendly patio!"}
{"text":"This place is a hot mess. We ordered online, arrived, and they couldn't find our order. Come to find out, they gave someone else our food. The employees were all scrambling around, and it wasn't busy for a Monday night. The sausage and caramelized pizza and the pepperoni pizza were just mediocre. On a positive note, their triple chocolate chip cookies are fantastic! But everyone knows I'd rather have a dessert than my meal. Fat kid problems."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in town. I always get the pepperoni and mushroom; you can't go wrong with basic. The crust is super thin, the sauce is perfect. It's just good ol' trusty for a fast-casual pizza."}
{"text":"I visited Sauce when I went on a trip to AZ for about a week.  We ordered 5 pizzas and 8 ciders for our party of 8.  All pizzas were really good, I prefer a thicker crust pizza than thin but after eating 5 different types of slices, they all tasted the same to me (texture wise). Never bit into a slice and didn't like it.. but I also don't discriminate pizza.  I was charged incorrectly on their cider (which was really good btw) and I didn't realize it til I saw my cc statement after I've already arrived back home in California.  Eryn, the manager at Sauce, helped me out through the phone and was very sincere and understanding about the entire issue that happened.  I am forever grateful for good service and if I ever go to AZ again I'd go to Sauce to say thank you to Eryn, but also to order more pizzas."}
{"text":"Where's the sauce?   My husband and I live close by and decided to go try it out since it is always busy. We ordered a pizza and salad to share. Salad was good- but I honestly don't remember to much about it.   Pizza was a major disappointment.  There was barely any sauce on the pizza! The sauce had good flavor but only tasted it for one bite out of the entire pizza. My husband couldn't taste it at all...The rest of the pizza was just bread, cheese, and meat. (Which honestly was also kind of burnt too!)  Maybe their pasta is good but now when we want pizza close by we just go to Papa Johns down the road.  Sorry Sauce :("}
{"text":"Had lunch at the North Scottsdale location.  Service was great, food was better!!!"}
{"text":"I have loved Sauce for their salads and pizza since it opened at the Norterra Shopping area.   I found a new appreciation for the restaurant and staff the other day. I called in an order and went in to pick it up only to find I had forgotten my wallet.  I asked if they had Apple Pay or if I could have my husband call in a credit card number but none of those options were available.  They very nicely just said it is on us.  I so appreciate their kindness. Great food and great service, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Food is pretty darn good, it's simple & reasonably priced :)"}
{"text":"This is an update based solely on the MAC AND CHEESE.  Since I've had Sauce back in 2014, I have raved about their mac and cheese to pretty much everyone.  Regardless of location, it has always been a must-order for me and it's always been cheesy and delicious!  My last trip here however I was solely disappointed!  Instead of a wonderful bowl of rich, stringy, cheesy, and flavorful goodness, I literally received a bowl of tasteless noodles in a bland soup somewhat resembling cheese sauce.  Initially, I thought it would improve a bit if I left it alone and let the cheese thicken up a bit, but it never did (sadness and sorrow). The \"cheese\" was so thin and bland that it could not even coat the noodles properly.  Easy Mac had more flavor than this particular bowl I had (sadness and sorrow x2).  Multiple stirs could not save it and my heart broke.  I'm hoping it was a fluke batch and a one-time thing.  Next time I visit AZ and if I'm here, I hope it's better!  Don't let me down Sauce!"}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to check this joint out?!  We went on a Monday afternoon, 5'ish.  Business was steady with eat-in, and take-out customers.  The first girl we met was young, adorable, friendly and enthusiastic.  As I looked around, I realized that all the servers fit that description.  The order taker was very knowledgeable of the menu; she did not say \"I don't know\" to any of our number of questions.  You place your order with her and then seat yourself.  The food came quickly.  The quality was fresh.  The volume was perfect, not grossly huge like claim jumper and not skimpy.  I ordered the pesto bruschetta - delish.  The roasted vegetable salad was the BEST roasted veggie salad I've had IN THE VALLEY.  Brussell Sprouts, acorn squash, walnuts, feta and generous portions of each...not like other salads that are mostly lettuce, this salad was substantial and the veggies were actually roasted, they had a nice char flavor to them.  My husband had a chicken pizza that he devoured much more quickly than is healthy.  His son had the mac and cheese, which was definitely housemade and looked delicious (though I would love for him to have added broccoli).  Rolling Rock cans were $2, jus' sayin'.  The pizza cookie was CLASSIC!  The peanut butter chocolate gelato that topped it was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and pasta!  Very nice spot.  Nice and clean.  Our family loves coming here.  It's a great combination of casual, family friendly and fun!  So happy they opened one in Norterra."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the pizza tonight.  Both of ours were over cooked and thinner than I've had at the Sauce in Chandler and Tucson.  We left regretting the last minute change from Zuppas.  I hope it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"The food was great and we had a nice time eating lunch. Why the 3 stars?  This place uses PLASTIC, disposable drink cups for soft drinks and water.  More unnecessary plastic in the landfill. This place needs to step it up and be greener."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite spot. Very modest but that does not mean they are slacking on food.  Excellent prices and great service, I recommend the chicken spinach walnut salad and the tiramisu is LEGIT!"}
{"text":"You know, after experiencing True Foods and some other restaurants Fox Restaurant Concepts have plated up for me, I was reticent to eat at Sauce.  Yeah, well fuck that goofiness.  Sauce is sauce-tacular, sauce-sational, sauce-ariffic even.    Man this is turning into a weak-sauce review (ba-dum-chee).  I'm not drunk or high or anything, I just can't think of anything else that'll make this baby pop, you know?  Lets see, me old lady and me had a cheese pizza and a salad.  Thank god she only ate a few slices cause I felt the need to scarf her half of the pie in addition to mine.  And I'd say I ate a good quarter of her salad. NOM NOM NOM.   Like a fat kid at a fatty camp.    So overall, two thumbs up.  I need to try to get sauced here the next time I'm here.    Sauce."}
{"text":"I ordered the Artichoke, Portobello, Goat Cheese, Red Pepper Bruschetta for appetizer. Ordered the Spicy Chicken Pizza, and my GF ordered the Rosemary Potato Pizza.   Overall I thought the bruschetta was excellent, both pizzas were spot on with taste, however.... I'd like a little more sauce on the pizza. It tends to be a bit dry especially towards the crust. Maybe next time I'll order extra sauce.  I'll be back, good food with a good price."}
{"text":"I was passing by 7th Street and Glendale with an itch on my tongue for something  sweet.  Should I run into Safeway and deal with the multitude of aisles and lin--  hey there's Sauce!  I've yet to try their desserts.  It was already late and only a few tables were occupied.  More importantly there was no line at the register.  Score!  Let me just pop in there and grab a cookie.    During a prior visit, an amigo of mine told me the cookies were good.  It looked good in his hand, too!  So on this particular night when the cashier informed me that a batch of their triple chocolate chip cookies had just gone into the oven, I decided to wait the 20 minutes or so that it would take for them to finish baking.    And how yummy would it be to have one freshly out of the oven?  Right?  Right?  Am I right?  Ooh, I could hardly wait.  Fast forward...to my utter disappointment.  What the heck happened?  You call that a cookie?  I think (maybe) someone got the recipe wrong.  For the customers' sake, I'm hoping it was a simple recipe mistake.    I don't cook, so I understand how difficult all the mathematics of a recipe can be. A tablespoon here, a teaspoon there, here a half cup, there a quarter cup, everywhere a whole cup.  Maybe whoever made the dough that evening put too much or not enough of something.  The dough was so oily it could not even hold itself together.   And I don't think they use butter.  Butter doesn't feel like that.  This was, this was...sad.  Just sad.  I didn't even put it into my mouth.  The oily residue on my fingers probably would have worked wonders rubbed into my dry wintered skin, but inside my gut.  No thanks."}
{"text":"I never thought about going to a Sauce restaurant until they opened one down the street for my house. I had the arugula and quinoa salad with goat cheese.....lots of yummy delicious goat cheese. My husband had the kale and salmon salad. The salmon was broken into small pieces instead of whole. I think it's because they could skimp on the salmon and you'll never know the difference. We each had a piece of artichoke, mushroom, roasted red pepper & goat cheese bruschetta. Everything taste delicious. Our total for dinner plus a glass of red wine was $32. We didn't know fresh bread came with the salad, we'll probably skip the bruschetta next time and just eat the bread. The table next to us ordered pizza. The crust looked super thin and short on toppings. Being from Chicago I'm picky about pizza. That being said, I'm not in love with deep dish, but I like a substantial slice. I'll try for myself next time.  Sauce is VERY, VERY kid friendly. If kids are not your thing (they are not mine) then I would go later in the evening or for lunch. Babies screaming in the line. Kids running around the outside patio. Little girls making a mess at the self serve beverage bar. All in all, a pleasant experience and we will return.....for lunch or when it is past the kids bed time."}
{"text":"I love their winter vegetable salad. I ask them to heat the veggies they always do. I could eat here a few times a week...sometimes I do...it would get 5 stars if made from scratch"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza is really really good. Give the summer salad a try, the mix of vegetables is really great, with a mix of crunch and soft. They also have some great summer specials for couples."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for a casual night out. We got the mozzarella fontina and basil pizza and lasagna with a side of macaroni. The lasagna was a little bland--my husband loves lasagna so he is pretty opinionated when it comes to that. The macaroni was just okay, could be better. It did have a nice light cheese on it and didn't taste soggy like some pastas that just sit for hours after being made. I liked that they brought out a little roll with butter on the side. The pizza crust is extremely thin. Definitely the best part of the meal though which is why I'm giving it a 4 star instead of 3. The atmosphere is just what we were hoping for. Good customer service. Medium noise level. Overall, it was good, don't know that I would recommend to anyone or come back though."}
{"text":"The food here is always so delicious.   I wish I lived closer, I would eat here more often.  We had 11 people in our group and I was the only person who had eaten here before.  Everyone loved what they got and I know the locals will be back.  The salads are so fresh and tasty and the pizzas were hot and so dang good.  I love the little rolls that come with the mac and cheese and the soup and salads.  They are hot and served with creamy butter.  I want some now!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled and expect too much out of pizza restaurants, but for some reason I just wasn't  impressed with this place. It was my first time at a Sauce restaurant too. I think I'm just not a fan of the \"pei Wei\" style ordering. I want to sit and have a waiter/waitress come to me.   The food was eh. I got the Mac and cheese side, which is pretty big for a \"side\" and the basil, fontina, and Mozzarella pizza. It was ok; nothing to rave about.   Prices are good. Cheap and reasonable.   I wouldn't dismiss this place if someone suggested it, but I won't be recommending it."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The pizzas are spectacular, and they have really good gluten free crust for all you fellow celiacs.   I recommend the Chicken Caesar & Parmesan pizza. It's basically an olive oil crust with a caesar salad on top. It sounds odd, and is a little tough to eat cleanly, but it is totally worth it!  Also, the business model is super efficient, and all the employees have been very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered the Caprese Bruscetta, Fennel & Arugula salad and the Suprema pizza. The bruscetta was delicious and the salad was yummy but didn't hit the spot. Pizza pretty decent but not up to par. Nice ambience and great customer service. Loved the Strawberry Basil Lemonade."}
{"text":"I've been to Sauce many times.   It's a quick dine-in/take-out sort of place, so don't expect anything too terribly fancy or special.  Sauce's specialty is pizza, which they offer in a wide variety of unique types.  They have the typical, normal pizza varieties and some more unusual ones, like a Caesar salad pizza or a melon pizza which come to mind.  They also serve panini sandwiches, simple pasta dishes, and salads and soup.  For dessert, they have cheesecake and tiramisu.  Finally, they offer a selection of wines and beer.  However, the thing that keeps me coming back over and over is the macaroni and cheese!  It's really lovely and somewhat addicting!  Very creamy and rich with flavor.  They also offer a variety with broccoli and chicken, but I prefer mine plain.  So, check that out!  It's worth a try.  A couple of things to keep in mind... It's usually very busy at the lunch hour, but it's quieter in the evening.  Prices are moderate.  Not cheap, but not too-too expensive."}
{"text":"Have always loved sauce until tonight when I had a long hair cooked into my grilled cheese panini. When I brought it to their attention they did not offer to reimburse me, but to make me another sandwich which I did not want. Ew. They really didn't even seem apologetic about it.  Used to come in every Sunday after church but no more.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Always a fantastic meal when my family and I come here! The service is friendly and accommodating, and the food is outstanding for the price. Pizza is always delicious, and the salads are always refreshing and fresh. The outdoor patio is beautiful, especially at night with the lights they have put up."}
{"text":"Where do you bring your family of 16 when no one can figure out what they want? Here!! There is something for everyone on their extensive but limited menu and they can piece together any combination of sauce or pasta to satisfy any picky eater. My rowdy family ordered nearly the entire menu and the staff helped corral all of us and arrange the tables so we could all sit together. Definitely this was a very amiable and delicious restaurant where I am sure we will visit again."}
{"text":"I am really, really sad to write this review.    I have been eating at Sauce for many years.  The salads and pizza are, as far as I know, still amazing.    However... they've destroyed my favorite thing on the menu.  The mac and cheese was watery the last few times I ordered it but this time they changed the pasta to spirals that taste funny AND it was watery.    I guess I have one less place on my very long list of places to eat in the valley... but this is one I hate to lose.  :("}
{"text":"We've been twice for their summer deal, which was a great deal. The first time we had the caprese salad, which I loved, and the prosciutto and melon pizza, which was.... ok. Nothing too exciting there, I wont get it again. The second time was the chicken and pine nut salad, this is salad was really good as well. We also had the sausage and caramelized onion pizza which was much better than the prosciutto one.  Its a great place for a cheap meal before a movie. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Love their thin crust pizza.  Daughter loves their pasta.  Wife loves their salads.  Oh, and they have those crusty little rolls.  Slathered in butter, they are delicious."}
{"text":"First time here.  Had a late lunch today because we had a gift card from our son.  This place is OK.  That's about all I can say . . . 2 pizza's + 2 beers = $30.  Crust is very thin.  Go if you love thin dry crust.  Don't think I'd ever go back.  There were a few tables with dirty dishes.  They weren't busy at all.  Wish I could say more.  I'm sorry but this place didn't excite."}
{"text":"$5.50 for a kick ass chopped salad, very nice.   I'll go back just to try a few more salads.  Pizza has super thin crust, about half as thick as a regular tortilla, but just perfect in every way.   We created our own pizza with spinach, artichoke, and feta and it was a very good creation if I don't say so myself.     Think of this place is a \"Chipotle\" style restaurant that makes pizzas, pastas, and salads.   Good prices, limited menu,  with clean contemporary interiors.   Sorry but I can't really complain, it was very good."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic... salads are amazing... pizza is tasty. Selection of wine is decent enough and not terribly overpriced. The seating is very cafeteria like - similar to Pei wei or Chipotle - you place your order and take your number and drinks to your seat... someone brings you your food and they clear your table of empty plates.   The food has been very reliable and I love to eat here.   I'm not a fan of the seating and atmosphere though - the menu should drop a buck or two here and there to reflect the ambiance.   The place usually has a good amount of people in it and depending on the time of day, someone's brought their noisy kids in there. It's not as bad as peter piper pizza, but I think the rich parents shopping at fashion square or waterfront consider it as such when their kids start crying for pizza. It's also a hot spot apparently for teenage high school girls... much like Ra Sushi.   If the food wasn't as good as it is, I'd never go there again."}
{"text":"I've always driven by this place but never really had a desire to try this place. My son kept on asking if we could go here today and I gave in. So it's our day on this place. Both my son and daughter has been here multiple times so I guess we'll give it a try.   The interior is nice with brick and decorated somewhat contemporary. The menu is on a big black board so you have to figure out what you want before you order. Fairly good sized menu. Once you order, they bring the food to your table.   I had the Meatball Paninis which was actually pretty good. Really good and tasty. They give you potato chips on the side. My wife and son split the pepperoni and sausage pizza. Thin crust and they give you about 8 slices. Really good and they enjoyed it. My son also had their Mac & Cheese which was gobbled up. So what can I say but the food was terrific. Only problem  is that it's a good portion but on the side of not enough. I left feeling a little hungry still.   They come by and pick up your empty dishes in a really timely manner so there weren't any table with dirty dishes. The staff was very friendly and did a good job.   So overall, I enjoyed the meal and the experience there. I would say that this place is a good lunch spot and not sure for dinner. So enjoy."}
{"text":"Sauce Pizza & Wine (2470 West Happy Valley Road, Phoenix, AZ 85085) offers the best \"Original Thin\" crust pizza I have ever eaten. My favorite is the Portobello Mushroom & Artichoke personal pizza. Accompanied by a Fresh Greens Salad and complimentary Artesian Bread Roll, this meal is perfectly filling and full of flavor. The facilities are clean and spacious, with seating available on the outdoor patio or inside dining room. Parking is readily available; however, at times a good walk away."}
{"text":"I eat at Sauce about once a week, it is convenient, consistent and generally very yummy.  The staff is always courteous, the food always comes out in a timely manner, although I will note, when dinning with a group some times food comes to the table over the course of 5 to 10 minutes.  I have also noticed that things aren't always \"hot\" when they get to you.  Other than those minor issues, Sauce is the perfect place for a quick lunch with colleagues or after an afternoon of power shopping. I recommend their Veggie Salad with the gorgonzola dressing (it doesn't come with the salad so you have to ask  for it by name!)."}
{"text":"I always order the vegetable salad, but on this day, I decided to add some meat to it.  I added chicken.  It was perfect that way too.  I love the dressing.  It has just the right amount of flavor without overpowering the salad."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect from Sauce, since there are SOOOO MANY restaurants to chose from....I wandered in here next door from Urban Outfitters.  SAUCE is kinda like Pei-Wei, you study the menu board in line, go to the next available cashier and place your order. They give you a number tent for your table and you wait for the server to bring your food. Service is friendly.  They give you cups to get your own beverage.  I like this concept...it's casual, quick, and not really full-service either.  The food was pretty good, I had the chopped chicken, pinenuts, gorganzola salad. It's not a HUGE salad, just a good size portion (maybe the size humans really should be eating???). We also had Mac & Cheese and a pizza...good food here.  The lunch special was a good deal (there are 3 versions): ANY chopped salad, side of pasta, and a beverage for $7.50.  I think the cheese pizza was $8.75...(crust is thin) fresh basil on it...yum!  I saw most Diners eating the caesar salad pizza...it was a salad spread all over a pizza. It seemed like every table had one.  I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I work off of 16th and really wanted a panini. Usually I would go to Fresh & Easy for their mozzarella sandwhich; but, yesterday I wanted a hot one. You know... toasty bread kind.   Seeing as how I was pressed for time, I needed some place I could call in my order and just pick up. Doing a quick iphone yelp search I found nothing. So, I went with what I knew. Sauce.   This review is strictly based on my panini experience. I have had their pizzas, which are pretty good. But, after going there yesterday, you may have to drag me to go back to this place!   The only non-meat option is the grilled cheese. At $6, it is a bit pricey... but I was willing to take the hit b/c I was craving. I phoned in my order, and added some arugula and tomatoes b/c lets face it... just cheese... boring.   I get there. My total was almost $9!!! NINE DOLLARS! I was floored! I was charged a dollar for a slice and a half of a tomato! Not even a juicy slice!!! A paper thin one!!!!!!! And, of course, another dollar for arugula!   To put the nail in the coffin, the \"panini\" - more of a toasted sandwhich - was so small!!! Maybe like 4 x4. I wish I could post the picture I sent to Joanna E. The sandwhich was the size of my coin purse!!!!!!   I cannot believe it. WHAT A RIP OFF!   I will not be returning. They cheated me. I hate cheaters!  UPDATE:  Check out the pictures. Joanne E. posted for me. THANKS!!!"}
{"text":"We will never go to this Sauce again. I ordered a salad and a pizza. We finished the salad and waited and waited for the pizza. I got up and asked the waitress if they forgot the pizza, she laughed and said yes that they forgot and it would be 10 min before we could get it.  She never apologized or offered to take some of the price off, nothing. Just rude!!"}
{"text":"First time dining in at Sauce, it's a fast dine-in type of place that serves pasta, pizza, wine and the like. Definitely casual, decent pricing and good food.  Stopped in with a few gals to have a bite to eat before heading out for cocktails for the night. We decided to share the Wild Mushroom Pizza and the Broccoli Mac & Cheese.   The pizza came with arugula, mushrooms and truffle oil and was delicious. For you thin, crispy crust fans this is it! Crunch and thin crust with light vegetarian toppings! Very good and not too greasy or heavy feeling. The Broccoli Mac & Cheese was good, well cooked pasta, creamy cheese sauce and pieces of broccoli. Definitely a lot better than The Vig's, it wasn't incredibly rich which made for easy eating and definitely second rounds.  The place is casual, but appropriate enough for a meal shared between couples. The staff was very pleasant and made sure we were all taken care of! Definitely, gonna come back to satisfy my thin crust pizza cravings!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Knowing the service is always slow, I ordered online because I had to be somewhere. Expecting the food to be ready when we got there we still waited thirty minutes, with only two other families in the whole restaurant. Finally we asked about our food and it had been sitting behind the counter the whole time. Not only was the food cold and crusty but unfortunately we were also late for our prior commitments. Finally the waiter asked how are food was after we picked over it for quite some time, I explained everything expecting something to be done about it and the only action taken place was a insincere apology."}
{"text":"I love sauce, the food is always good.  I have gotten to go orders before and its always ready on time. Every time I have came here its been great food and service.   I usually get the Mariana and pasta. My tired the chicken mac n cheese once , it wasn't my cup of tea and the manager was nice enough to trade it out for my regular without charging me."}
{"text":"Gross,  the pizza lacks flavor and quality.  The turkey sandwich used to be one of my favorites but their quality has gone down so much.  Food lacked quality and flavor all around.  Except for the roasted red pepper, mushroom, artichoke  bruschetta which has too much flavoring and is gross too.  The cannoli and chips are the only thing well done."}
{"text":"I have definitely become a great fan of Sauce! Every single thing I have had the opportunity to try has been delicious! I took a bite of each of my friends' dishes and everything tasted great. I ordered the sausage and caramelized onion pizza and added some red peppers. OMG, it was so amazing! It was a perfect combination of flavors and the thin crust was also very good! The kitchen accidentally made a cheese and basil pizza and kindly offered it to us! Even without a great amount of toppings it was a delicious pizza. My friend's daughter was in love with it, and she is typically a picky eater! I had a bite of my friends dishes - lasagna and mac n' cheese- they were both very flavorful and you could taste that they were made with fresh ingredients. It was a beautiful day outside so we decided to sit outside, the staff was very kind and brought out a high chair for the 2 year old. I was impressed at the size and quality of food that they serve with reasonable prices. I see that Yelp has a lot of good things to say about their salads, so I plan to get one next time! I cannot wait to come back for more, but I will admit it will be difficult to order anything other than their amazing sausage and caramelized onion pizza."}
{"text":"The Good: Service, Its Clean, Iced Tea  The So-So: Alfredo cheese pasta sauce  The Bad: All the rest of the food.  I really don't get the good reviews here.  $2 frozen pizza from the supermarket will blow this pizza away.  Dry (read almost no sauce) maybe 6 real thin pepperonis and cardboard crust, make grade school pizza look good.  Chicken has no flavor and was chewy and pasta dish was served only mildly warm.  Total waste of money.  How this 'chain' stays in business is beyond me."}
{"text":"Sauce is a fantastic place to go if you're looking for great pizza, pasta, salad and wine on a budget.  For the quality of food you get, the price is really great. My mom and I split a pizza, caesar salad and two drinks and the bill was under $20 with tip, but it tasted like it was from an upscale restaurant, rather than from an order-at-the-counter bistro.  I have a few friends that go to Sauce all the time, and I've never heard anything bad about it. Anytime you're looking for great Italian food without having to pay a ton for it- go to Sauce."}
{"text":"This little chain restaurant has been a life save for us. We are new to the area and needed something quick to eat that wasn't fast food and we love it! The service has been great dinning in and togo!! You should try it!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty content with everything I get from here! I've never gotten a pasta that I didn't like! Great prices."}
{"text":"Ok so this is the first time I ordered via online for this location mind you I have ordered thru eat 24 before no issues ..so when I show up almost an hour later to pick up my food. Somehow the system didn't send my order thru but actually I know this is complete bullshit because it sent me confirmation that my order was received by the restaurant and they were already preparing my food to go ..if would not be that big of a deal if I had been treated with exceptional customer service upon arriving to pick my to go order up but the guy working the to go  register  was a complete waste of space not only was he over the top arrogant but rather pompous and very rude. Thats the main reason I'm writing this review is purely based on his lack of customer service and needs to learn a thing or two about the service industry . I prob will not be returning to this location ..."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is always great and the service is even better.  At many restaurants, you never see the manager unless there is a problem.  At Sauce, the manager is usually out front and interacting with guests.  On our last visit, my son had the Meatball and Mozzarella Panini and loved it.  It was more than he could eat.  I had the Chicken Caesar and Parmesan Pizza - which was unique and delicious.  We love stopping in here when we're in town (frequently)."}
{"text":"Terrible food, meatballs tasted nasty. They ran out of Pinot noir and only choice was chianti...... Very bitter. Not a pleasant experience. Will not be here again!"}
{"text":"LOVE their pasta shells, broccoli, & chicken dish (made for 2!) & various thin crusts. Service is as good as it gets for upscale fast food. Pricey, however portions are filling"}
{"text":"Pizza is unique and may not appeal to all Pizza Lovers!  Ultra thin crust and toppings very light!  For example when I picked up the box (carry Out) it felt empty.  Good taste!  Mac & Cheese bland and not cheesy enough for me.  Nice trendy atmosphere quick service but for the price Pizza Hut's thin crust leaves me more satisfied."}
{"text":"Lunch rush and only one person taking orders and then stops to take phone orders. Also having to ask for tables to be cleaned. Looks like more staff needs to be hired for this location. Hopefully food as good as other locations. Well had food- salads overdressed and soggy -gross! Mac and cheese good But honestly how can you mess that up"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong they have great food but the service at this location is AWFUL! We have called in to go order multiple times and have sat in the restaurant for 30+ minutes for our pizza. We called 20 minutes before and they said it would take just 15 minutes. The manager doesn't know what he is doing when we complain. Get better management and actually start making the food for to go orders when the people call..."}
{"text":"This place is really good for what it is (a very casual, kid-friendly, medium-priced restaurant). The food was all good. We tried pizza, pasta, and salad. The kids bowl of pasta was big and two of my toddlers split it (with me stealing some too). The pizza wasn't really my style, since it was very thin with very little sauce, though some people love that kind. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. I would definitely come back here for good food with kids in tow. Definitely not with girlfriends or on a date night."}
{"text":"I really don't know what the rave is all about. I found this place ordinary and lacking in the delicious department. The pizza was soggy, the pasta sauce was bland, and the meatballs were overcooked. Very disappointing. Maybe I'm missing something because it was packed when I went there on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of Sauce. Try the Chicken Cesar pizza or the macaroni & cheese. SOOOO good, and for the price? Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Not the same, the pizza is gross & the meat not cooked all the way.  Had cold pasta, utensils not clean, floors dirty.  Service is not good.  Review is true,Do not attack the reviewer"}
{"text":"Such delicious pizza and served nice and hot! Best meal I've eaten in Scottsdale. $16 got me a good sized pizza (probably should have saved some for later - but is was so good!) and a locally brewed beer. Service was friendly and prompt. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"We love Sauce.  My husband and I each get a Caesar Salad and split a create your own pizza:  Original Thin Crust No Sauce on Pizza (we get it on the side) Cheese Feta Roasted Red Peppers  Olives  Delicious. The pizza is nice and thin but SO flavorful!  I also like their side Pasta, Red Sauce, and Mozzarella.  The people who work there are always nice and the restaurant is lovely and clean."}
{"text":"The pizza and pasta are so good. They have Tiramisu for under $5 for a decent sized slice."}
{"text":"You have to get there hand stretched pepperoni pizza. It is better than pizza Bianco"}
{"text":"Worst take out experience ever!  I ate there for the first time last week and loved it.  I ordered a salad for lunch for pickup today and it was minuscule compared to when I ate at the restaurant.  I will not being doing that again.  Way too expensive for the amount of food!!!"}
{"text":"Quick, fast casual dining. We've been here many times (I always forget to take a photo before eating). I love the modern/farmhouse decor. Always have good service, and i like that they allow dogs on the patio. It is very clean and even though you don't have servers, the staff is attentive and still comes around to deliver the food and clean up the plates. We got the vegetable salad (it was seriously so good) and the mushroom, pepperoni pizza. We have gotten the food for takeout but the pizza gets soggy fast since we usually get thin crust so I would recommend to eat there!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good.  Heavenly salads delicious pizza and cookies so good you will buy them everytime!  The chicken and pine nuts salad is my favorite salad ever!  The staff is excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Sauce has gotten a lot better recently.  This store really went downhill after Fox RC sold them off but it has come back.  I live very close to here and frequent it a lot.  For a while, it was just plain bad.  Now, it's back to it's prior glory.  If you haven't been in a while because the food got bad, you should probably check it out again.  If I didn't buy hundreds in Sauce cards from Costco, I might not have \"checked in\" as frequently but I can say for the last 5-6 months the food has been much better"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Lasagna tasted packaged. Pizza was good, but not great. Locals go on and on about this place. Love all of the other fox restaurants that we have tried. This one just wasn't what we expected."}
{"text":"I love, love Sauce! The caprese salad, the spicy chicken sausage with poblano peppers pizza, and the sausage with caremelized onion pizza are so delicious! Restaurant is clean, lovely patio seating, and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I adore their chicken pinenuts and gorgonzola salad. It is really good and a great portion for lunch. I eat that I am full and satisfied for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"I really don't see what is so great about Sauce. Maybe for chains this is as good as it gets? Pizza and sandwiches are just okay, nothing I would drive 300 yds out of my way for. Yeah, I would drive 300 yds! Maybe if you are stuck in a strip mall with a somewhat time crunch this is your place. I don't want to bash it because it is a clean place with fresh food. I guess my tastebuds have moved on from the chain restaurant grub."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Cravings. Goat cheese, soppressa and asparagus bruschetta? Turn me on. The flavor is incredible. Grilled cheese panini and tomato basil soup comfort food at its best. So impressed and ready to go back."}
{"text":"Solid pizza for pizza night. Great concept from Fox for thin crust pizzas. We order at least once a month, and can ways count on quality pizza and salads.  Very happy with the gluten free crust option- its a great alternative- and guilt-free way to enjoy pizza.  We have tried many versions of pizza, and love the Roasted Potato, as well as general staples such pepperoni and sausage.   Absolutely LOVE their macaroni and cheese! Expect huge portions! A side is more than plenty....  Lastly- their Chicken Pine Nut salad is quality :)"}
{"text":"Wow. Sauce.  Did not disappoint. Tasted amazing! Everything  Seemed so fresh. My first time at Sauce.  I will return. The service was excellent. Props to the Manager"}
{"text":"The fact that they offer a gluten free crust (a tasty one at that) is appealing in and of itself, but the toppings are unique and delicious. A great place to come for lunch during a workday or anytime you want a truly tasty pizza and not something from a box."}
{"text":"Mildly disorganized approach due to milling people at entrance. Felt the menu boards to entrance and walking areas too close to see complete menu board. Had a 5 Guys feel at entrance. Flow of drinks awkward with server station and lavatories close proximity. Caprese salad was standard fare, felt like this was associated with Corner Bakery with same balsamic vinaigrette profile. Pretty boring salad with not a lot of tomatoes. Bruschetta was ehh.  Pepperoni and crimini pizza was quick to to come after order placed. Decent franchise-esk on par with what you would expect. Middle of the road."}
{"text":"We get Sauce salads to go for dinner a lot.  My favorite is the chicken with pinenuts and I usually substitute the blue cheese for goat or feta and I get the vinaigrette instead of the dressing it comes with.  It's delicious and filling.  The chicken is shredded and always cooked perfectly, it tastes like rotisserie chicken.  It also comes with a tasty dinner roll and butter.  I'm not really a fan of their pizzas because they are too thin for my liking, but I know some people that really do like them.  I've also had the shells and meatballs which I love, the sauce is delish!  I recommend for take out or a laid back dinner.  You can order beer and wine.  They don't really have wait service, you order and pay up front and then they bring you the food."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time to Sauce! My hubby and I have been wanting to try it for awhile so we decided to go for lunch. We started with the bruschetta which was amazing! Then we each got a small side salad, the caesar and the chicken, apple, and spinach. Both were great! Then we got a thin crust pepperoni pizza which was average. The pizza was so thin, the only thing I could compare it to would be a crispy/burned tortilla with pizza toppings. It would literally crumble when you picked it up! You could tell that the pizza had flavor but the fact that it crumbled into crispy thin pieces didnt so it any justice! Also, all of the food came out at the same time! Literally the entire meal. So we felt like we had to rush through it all to get to the pizza so it was still hot. We will try this place again and order the other type of pizza and hope the food comes out in order."}
{"text":"Sauce would be my favorite place for pizza! Usually come here after my workout to grow! Great amazing food! Also great workers!"}
{"text":"The restaurant always has amazing food and service. I frequent this restaurant quite often. You can't get better pizza for the price. The manager does an amazing job. Rarely does the manager go noticed in an establishment and you really feel his presence. He always makes sure everything goes smooth. I haven't done a lot of reviews on here and I got on here to do one because that gentlemen has given us such great service."}
{"text":"Fast casual for pizza and salads. The pasta dish I had not so good, but they do a very good job with pizza and especially salads. Very good pricing, and service."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is amazing. Get the portobello and artichoke! The caprese salad and the pesto chicken pizza were so authentic! It was like I was back in Europe!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Sauce and was a little underwhelmed by the experience. Ordered the Mac and cheese with chicken and the noddles were way undercooked. The saving grace from the experience was the staff was super nice and was very helpful. I was able to switch out my Mac and cheese with pizza. The pizza was good but not a great first time experience when you feel hangry."}
{"text":"Sam fox restaurants are the best! Food here is pricey so when I do go it's a treat to myself! To die for....Sam Fox your rich as ever come down a little on prices! It's fast casual not fine dining!"}
{"text":"Good enough for us to go back when we're feeling lazy but not good enough to rave about it.  It's fast, convenient and decent.  And impossible to take a piss in. Seriously. 1 stall for like, 40-70 customers. I swear every time I need to take a leak or wash my hands, someone's in there--writing a novel on the crapper or something . . ."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   Located in the heart of the \"waterfront\" district in Scottsdale (yeah it's just a canal, and you can't see it from Sauce or most of the district in the first place, but it's the desert ok?), the unchain chain (it's a Fox Restaurant Concepts venue) does a nice job of good food at reasonable price and with pretty good speed.  Service is still a bit in training mode - but it did just recently open.  With a simple wall menu and pricing scheme, there is a large selection of thin crust pizzas - the kind you truly get in central and northern Italy.  While the cheese pizza I had was excellent, there were some nice mildly exotic offerings as well.  The beef lasagna was, for the price of $9, also a very very good choice.  While there was nothing wrong with the salad ordered (sorry - I think is was their Chicken and ? salad)  the order taker didn't know what type of lettuce (mixed) and it was way to light on dressing.  Good - but I wouldn't drive there for it.  Italian beer (Moretti's - yum) was nice.  The wine by the glass was not  special.  Chintzy retro-ish juice glasses were used, the Pinot Noir (only 1 selection per category) was ok.  But to get a 2nd glass I also had to go back up to the counter.  Even though it's a counter order system where they then deliver the food to your number & table, it still seems they should go the extra step for additional orders of food and drink.  Soda was one of those all you can drink fountains.  But for a bill of $45 with tip for 3,in the heart of Scottsdale, it's definitely  a place I'll stop in again if it's \"quick, casual, simple and tasty\" that I'm looking for.  Cheers"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant but don't ever order their pesto pasta. It was literally just noodles with olive oil on them. I would have asked for more sauce but it was runny and had no flavor :("}
{"text":"What a fabulous place to meet friends for lunch after a few hours of holiday shopping!!! Right across the street from Fashion Square, this place is in a prime location for shoppers to rest their weary feet and escape from the frantic craze that is Christmastime at the mall. All of their food is delicious, but my personal favorite combo is the Chicken, pine nut, tomato & Gorgonzola salad with the wild mushroom and truffled arugula pizza (split between friends). The pizzas are mostly all under $10 a piece, and if you're not starving and don't want to share, you can get one of their many pasta sides and leave it at that. I like to enjoy a glass of wine with my lunch, and they have plenty to choose from. In the summertime, they even have a $20 special that gets you a pizza, salad, and two glasses of wine. That's $10 bucks each for you and a friend! The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the interior decor is seriously lacking (reminds me of a nice cafeteria), and you aren't able to take your wine to any of the outside tables because their patio is not closed off to the sidewalk. Overall, though, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"ok, Tried Sauce in Chandler, n now this one....   Unless you are into over spending for less food just because it may be a little healthier, then have at it.. The flavors have been bland, and leave out of there for about 12 dollars and seriously still hungry....   I tried the Wild Mushroom pizza actually served on a Tortilla :-( lightly dusted with some cheese, ,,, mehhhhh  Meatball Panini, is the only reason for the 2 stars and not 1... it did have some flavor, and the sauce it came with for dipping was decent, i would def try again forl like 6 bucks,,,, Not 10.  Out of rotation ----"}
{"text":"WOW! WOW! WOW! There gluten free pizza is amazing! Best crust I have had in a long time and it still tastes good the next day. I wish they were able to make the food a little faster, but overall service is good, the team is friendly and the environment is relaxing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome- and it's even better on a hot afternoon when they are running their 2 for $20 deal! Get a decent size pizza and a crisp refreshing Caesar salad, and 2 glasses of wine for $20!! Amazing ! And to top it all the staff is so nice and accommodating at this location! If aren't happy they aren't and will make sure you get what you need to feel satisfied and full! Thanks Sauce! I'll be back soon-"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic but there just wasn't enough of it, hence 4 stars instead of 5.  Had the roasted vegetable salad with salmon, some if the butternut was still hard/undercooked  but salmon was cooked perfectly the champagne vinaigrette was fabulous I saved half to take home. Even though it's a tad pricey, I highly recommend this restaurant and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service! They really run their business by the modo \"the customer is always right\"! I witnessed an incident where a customer was clearly wrong (he wasn't rude) but thought something automatically came with him meal that he didn't pay for. The waitress got the manager and he explained the situation and they brought it out anyway free of charge.   That isn't why I gave them 5 stars though. I LOVE the potato pizza and the salad. All the ingredients are fresh and tasty. It's nice that you can still get a glass of wine or a beer in such a casual setting. I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The service staff is always friendly.  Took my friend here for her birthday and shared the 2 for $20, that included a pizza/salad and 2 glasses of wine.  For that price you can't beat it. Little loud and food was yummy"}
{"text":"Yummy food! I love the mac-n-cheese, the grilled cheese, their chips, and their tomato soup which is THE BEST! Everything here is always delicious! The staff is very friendly! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite for me and my friends. I love the concept of this place. The prices are great, the atmosphere is great, and the food is delicious. The tiramisu is wonderful. I just love this place. I always bring new people, and they always love it . It's family friendly too. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Thin and Saucey. Fresh and cold. No I'm not talking about Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton. It's the pizzas and salads at Sauce. I normally don't like the order here, sit down there kinda restaurants. But this place does it right. I'm not going to get into NY vs. Chicago vs. California vs. Tombstone. Save that for a thread, right? I love pizza. So I love them all. Depends on my mood. These pies are delightful. My fave is the sausage and caramelized onion. The potato pizza is hella good. Spinach salad with pine nuts and goat cheese...perfect with my sausage pizza. Service is cheap and the prices are friendly. There's plenty of atmosphere and the parking is light and airy. So get Sauced. Today!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, relaxed atmosphere. Pizza cookie with gelatin was on point. Definitely a place I will recommend and return to. Thank you Sauce for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This reminded me a little of II vicino back home. The pizza was much better, and the past, and the sandwich, pretty much everything was better than II Vicino and I really enjoy II Vicino as well I hear that this place is coming to ABQ in the near future so I am looking forward to that!"}
{"text":"I've been here only twice or 3 times, but I had a great experience everytime. We've only ordered pizza and salad, not pasta. The pizza was amazing and the salad (chicken, spinach and apple with candied walnuts) was to die for. We ordered the chicken pesto pizza and the mozzarella, fontina and basil pizza. Service was quick. The decor is very fresh and modern. I also like their outdoors seating! I love it here and would love to go back"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Allll the pizza here is phenomenal.  You can't go wrong with any veggie pizza here. :))) great customer service and very attentive.    I LOVE THEIR ROLLS. :)"}
{"text":"How to lose $1000...  Me: boys, what do you want on your pizza? Boys: we want black olives on our pizza. Poor employee at register: we don't have black olives, we only have Clamato olives. Me: I'm sorry will have to go somewhere else that has black olives like every other pizza restaurant on the planet.  Solution: go buy some flipping black olives and put them on your menu like every other pizza restaurant on the planet.  Hopefully the owner or the management reads this review and figures out the solution to the problem so all of your patrons that really like a extremely common topping can dine at your establishment. Until then I will take my money elsewhere even though I live right around the corner."}
{"text":"The food is good, the reason I'm giving 1 star is because of the poor service we got. When we came there was only 1 other family dining there, yet they forgot 2 of our orders and when they brought them out after a reminder it was the wrong order.   By the time they brought out the right orders the kids ran out of patience and we ran out of appetite.  They never offered to compensate us for our inconvenience.  We will most likely choose to go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. But the service, ah, the service, 8 of the slowest moving servers ever. I wasn't sure they weren't doing mannequin challenge. Paid online, didn't have some of the food I ordered. Cluster F. Never again."}
{"text":"I can't count how many times I've been to Sauce and I've never ever been disappointed.   I really enjoy Sauce for a lot of reasons, but especially because they have more than one vegetarian option. Nearly half of their menu is vegetarian and on the non-vegetarian items, meat can easily be omitted from the dish without changing it too much.  EAT. THE. MACARONI. AND. CHEESE. If you eat meat, get it with chicken and broccoli. If you don't eat meat, stick with the broccoli. Holy moly. It is the best macaroni and cheese I've ever tasted.   The vegetable and caprese salads are my favorites; they're both really fresh and I love the dressings.  Now, I hesitate to call their pizza PIZZA. I'm from Chicago. I know real, good pizza. Sauce isn't classic pizza, and anyone who is heading into there thinking it is WILL be disappointed. Now, if you're looking for a new, fresher spin on a pie, then Sauce is your place.  I've eaten every kind of pizza Sauce has to offer (I said I've been there quite a bit!), but my favorites are:  Prosciutto and melon (damn my vegetarianism, I can't eat it any more!) - super fresh tasting; great salty/sweet. If you get it to go, ask them to pack the prosciutto and melon separately (as well as separately from the pizza). If not, you'll regret it - the pizza is a soggy mess otherwise.  Wild mushroom and truffled arugula - my tried and true favorite. To me, it's the one that tastes most like \"classic pizza.\"  When my boyfriend and I went there a few days ago, though, he wanted to try something new; we tried the Rosemary Potato (with spinach, feta, and olive tapenade).  It was delicious. It was pretty greasy in comparison to their other pizzas, but still really tasty! The feta was awesome, as well."}
{"text":"Good food.  Pricey. Friendly staff especially the North Scottsdale location.  Ordered the Mayo Clinic 15 pizzas from here and they said they thoroughly enjoyed them.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Pizza and Caesar salad were great, pretty neat place to get a quick eat"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza. Meatballs great. Got delivery. Pizza is gone with tiny meatballs Salad for later. Missed eating this used to live here"}
{"text":"Sauce has great pizza and has traditionally had great salad and pasta as well. On this visit the pizza and salad were both great, but the mac and cheese was lacking. It was more like buttered noodles than mac and cheese... With that said, everything else about my visit there was fantastic.  Sauce does thin, nearly personal sized pizzas that have the perfect combination of crispy crust and melted cheese. As long as you stick to the pizza here, you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Best spot to have lunch. Yummy pizza and salads! I am going to be such a regular when I become a neighbor soon."}
{"text":"I first tasted Sauce not too long ago at a Phoenix location. I fell in love with the taste of the pizza as well as the quality of the food and the environment. I live in E. Mesa so about a month ago I found the location in Dana Park and decided to go there. I placed a phone order for three pizzas on a Friday night.  Once I got there 20 mins later my food was not ready. The girl at the register was very impatient and did not even greet me. They seemed rushed and just wanted to take my money and make me wait another 10mins. There were way too many people in the back that didnt look very clean. Anyhow I finally received my food and it tasted ok.  So I decided to go again hoping for a better experience.  In fact it was worse. I specifically said what I wanted on my pizzas. I get there and still have to wait for my food for a while. I was offered a cup of water for my wait. I got my pizza and it was incorrect. So they apologize offer me a soda and cookies while I wait felt like 30 more minutes. Mean while they seem to keep forgetting about me. The nice guy at the register had to keep reminding them that I was waiting. I remained very patient but I was very frustrated.  As I was waiting I noticed that behind the counter was not clean at all. The place was busy and dirty. Once I finally got home. Our pizzas were a soggy mess. I'm so disappointed with just this location. I will just travel to a different location next time."}
{"text":"I love pizza and salad. Always. :) Sauce has both of those so of course I like it!  First, know that this is not the super greasy, huge, cheesy slices that we also love! The pizza here is more like that on a diet. :D If you aren't into the fresh, light, healthy kinda pizza, then I wouldn't recommend it. I got the Mushroom and arugula pizza which was pretty good! I would say maybe there is too much arugula piled up on top to the point where you feel like you're eating a full on salad. But it's not a big deal to me. Just take some off.   The salads here are pretty good. I like the chicken, pine nuts, tomato, and gorgonzola. I'm don't usually order salad because they don't feel like a meal to me but that one is really good.   I like the style of ordering here although I've read that some people don't like it. It's similar to wildflower, where you line up, look at the menu on the walls and order at the counter. Then, they bring your food to your table along with some rolls if you would like. This is a pretty quick and efficient way of getting your food and the servers are really nice! I was surprised that they even refilled my drinks for me at the self-service fountain."}
{"text":"Not only is the food ridiculously amazing but the people are even more ridiculously awesome!   I locked my keys in my car as I was coming to pick up my order and they were more than accommodating! They were happy to keep my food in the warmer until I was able to get in my car, offered me something to drink and even cookies (it was impossible to say no).   Most places would have just forgotten about you once you paid but they made sure to make feel welcome and even took the time to let me know that even though they were closing, I was more than welcome to stay until the locksmith got here. This place is great and I ended up devouring my lasagna before I left, it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Visiting my daughter who is attending GCU and she suggested Sauce. Went in the evening and it was a very cool vibe. We ordered a glass of wine and the pine nut and chicken salads. Salads were fresh and the chicken was perfect. Would have rated it a 5 star except there were 3 kids that raced around our patio table screaming for the first half hour while their parents ate peacefully inside. Wish staff would have kindly asked the family to reel their kids in. All in all, good good, good service."}
{"text":"C & I stopped by on our way to his performance in Pinocchio. I have been a fan of Sauce since the first time I stopped by the original in Tucson years ago. C had never been here before however. I've always liked how the restaurant feels. The exposed brick & modern furnishings, pictures on the wall all make it very pleasant. However, here is where I have to toss in one of the negatives. This location can get loud. There's really nothing to absorb the ambient noise floating around so as the place gets busier, and louder, it can become a bit intrusive. If the noise is too much for you, outside you will find a nice patio which you pass as you enter the front doors. The menu covers pizza, pasta, panini's, salads, soups, kids meals & desserts. They offer a decent selection of wine & beer as well. The person who took my order was very pleasant, he read the order back to me which I appreciated. He gave us our table number and off we went to find a seat. So yes, this is yet another fast casual restaurant where you order at a counter, get a number and find a seat and they bring your food to you.   C and I ordered the Build Your Own Pizza ($7.75) and added Sausage ($1.00). We chose the Artisan Hand stretched crust. The crust came out pretty good although I did feel it could have been left in the oven another minute or two. The  sausage was not overly spicy and had good flavor. Winner winner sausage pizza dinner. Lovely decor, nice patio, good food, fair prices, nice staff, loud accoustics. 4.5 Stars."}
{"text":"We ordered a salad and a pizza, both my husband and I found the salad to be made with wilted greens, croutons that were hard enough to break a tooth.  The pizza we ordered was the sausage and caramelized onions one.  Only a few tiny pieces of sausage among the majority of the topping being onions.  The service was good,  the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"I got the roast beef and mozzerella panini; it was bland and dry. The white bean and potato soup was good.  Just average."}
{"text":"Hey, have you heard of Sauce's summer special? One pizza, one salad, and two glasses of wine for $20!  Yes please! This special and place makes it for a fun, affordable, casual date spot. I'll definitely be returning here quite a bit during the summer months."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place always makes me hungry when I think of it. The customer service is great! Everyone is very friendly. I think he pizza is the best besides the macncheese. I think everyone should give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Sauce is a great mix of good simple food. From bruschetta, a grilled cheese, pasta 'n meat balls, cheese cake and tiramisu, we had a sample of them all. It was dinner time on a Saturday night, but we still got a table quick. The staff was on the ball, quickly getting our orders in, cleaning up tables and making sure we were happy. The staff left a very positive impression, but so did the food! The bruschetta was packed with flavor, sweet savory, loved the basil and the fresh mozzarella. The grilled cheese was awesome, the bread was done in like a panini grill so it had nice deep, crispy lines in it. The pasta 'n meat balls was the largest portion and didn't disappoint anyone. Finally we splurged on desert, the cheesecake had a raspberry dressing added to it which really livened it up. Finally the tiramisu really hit the spot. Its a must get when you come to Sauce. Overall, our party had a great time and will certainly be back."}
{"text":"MMMmmm this place has some yummy flatbreads! Got the wild mushroom and truffle arugula pizza and a chicken apple and spinach salad. Both items were excellent and comes in such large servings that my roommate and I couldn't finish it in one sitting. Everything tasted fresh and healthy... not heavy like most pizzas. Prices are fair for the quantity, service is good too!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The place was nice and clean. The menu has a large selection of items, all very reasonably priced. The guy who took our order was very friendly, which is a considerable change--especially nowadays with the lack of customer service. In fact, everyone seemed to be very friendly. There was a little girl next to us who spilled her drink, and one of the managers came over to clean it--on the floor. Talk about great leadership. The customer service alone gets this place five stars. About the food: we ordered a chicken caesar salad. The salad was very tasty and overflowing with chicken. We also ordered a \"build your own\" pizza with ricotta. The pizza was tasty, but I was slightly disappointed in the portion of the ricotta (which was about a tablespoon total on a 12\" pizza). However, not disappointed enough that I won't be rushing back! They have pasta and several different desserts that I will be back to try! Definitely impressed!"}
{"text":"We go there at least once a week. The prices are reasonable, the portions are good and the food is excellent. Additionally, the service is excellent. Definitely make this part of your regular restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Don't go out of your way to come here -- you'll be disappointed.   Sauce is a fast-casual concept that serves beer and wine (like Chipotle). Be forewarned that while you can order alcoholic drinks, their liquor license does not permit drinking on the patio. You have to keep your party indoors.  I went in with three other people. Three of us got the chicken and broccoli pasta and one got the meatball panini. That panini was the best thing on the table. The interesting thing about the pastas was that two of them were cold -- room temperature at best. The other one was blazing hot. I'm not sure what they do with their chicken here, but it has the taste and texture of canned chicken. They also ran out of wine glasses during our visit. When we ordered our second round, we were told we had to wait for clean glasses. We all finished our entrees and the glasses still weren't ready. Had to get a refund. Super disappointing.   I might be back to grab a pizza for takeout. It seems that's what it's known for. Definitely won't be bringing a group in again."}
{"text":"Just had the lasagna pie. It was good, the place is nice and clean. Staff was friendly and helpful, then Hank walked in.  He started yelling about how good he is at throwing pizza dough in the air. Then he tried to get behind the counter to \"show them how it's done.\"  He was tackled by 3 patrons and dragged out, while everyone clapped and cheered.  I recommend Sauce, I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend on Saturday night and we both had the chicken pine nut salad. She had been raving about this salad forever, so I needed to see what all the fuss was about. Sat on patio. Nice evening. Music outside needs to be louder as we could barely hear it and I'd much rather hear it than the other diners conversations. The salad came out almost as quick as  we sat down, which was awesome, and each came with a warm roll. My friend immediately commented that her salad didn't have enough dressing (mine was fine) and stopped one of the servers who was walking by. She asked if he could please bring her a little more dressing, and while giving her the stare down, he replied in a snarky voice \"are you saying there isn't enough dressing on the salad?\" She was surprised by his comment and just kind of mumbled that it was dry, and he said he would grab some for her. While I would have said something smart like \"No, there is plenty on the salad, I'd just like extra to look at\"..that isn't her style..so she let it go.  So while we were both annoyed, this kid comes back with her dressing...and APOLOGIZES! He said he didn't mean to come off rude and it came out wrong and that he was sorry! Nice! Now back to the salad. Chicken was dry, pine nuts lacking, salad was BASIC! Go home Carol you are drunk....and never speak of this salad again!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Sauce. We went here for dinner last night, and wanted something quick, tasty and casual. Done. I think of it as a cross between a fast food place and a pizzeria.  I had the Pepperoni and Crimini Mushroom pizza, and it was great. The crust is amazingly thin yet perfect for the pie. The center where the toppings are is a nice and soft but the edges are super crispy with a chip-like \"crunch\". The sauce and toppings were noticeably fresh and perfectly proportioned on the pizza.  M had the Turkey salad, and she too was very pleased. I can describe hers much - as we both stuck to our plates!  The waitstaff was very pleasant and everything came out well; however nothing really blew me away to earn that 5th star."}
{"text":"The pizza and salad are always great!! Went today and got the sausage and caramelized onion pizza and the salad with beets (I don't remember the name). Great family place."}
{"text":"Delicious food. The service is so prompt, friendly, and professional. I go on my work breaks and food is always ready for me quickly. It is also very affordable for the quality of food you are getting. I love their salad and soups. Makes for a fairly healthy meal as well."}
{"text":"Love Sauce. Pizzas are always good, but my favorite thing to order is the Chicken, Spinach, Apple salad! Always very clean and  the staff is super friendly. They like to ensure that everything comes out ok, and are always offering to do whatever they can to make the experience more enjoyable! Definitely a great location, and the patio seating is great when the weather is nice :)"}
{"text":"Another spot that has quick service with great food but you don't have to rush your meal.    Today I ordered the Roasted Vegetable salad which was a nice sized portion, very fresh with a delicious red wine vinaigrette dressing.     I also ordered two pizzas- the Prosciutto and Fig pizza as well as a build your own pizza with Meatball, Garlic and Onion which was oh so tasty.  The crust is very thin so you don't feel like you get stuffed from eating too much pizza crust.   Another restaurant that serves Passport Iced Tea- Company based here in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love the caprese salad here! However today there was about 1/4 of the dressing container full. :("}
{"text":"This place was nice.  Pretty quick and easy, and reasonably priced.  They forgot to bring out our drinks so then to make up for it they gave us a free cookie. The food was good, nothing spectacular, but hot, fresh and flavorful. It was quiet and relaxing atmosphere inside.  It hink we will be back when we just need a quick meal.  We had the pasta though, and I think next time I want to try the pizza."}
{"text":"You really can't beat their summer special - a salad, a pizza, and two glasses of wine for 20$.... great deal. So why 3 stars? It really isn't worth the cost the rest of the year. I have been to Sauce a couple of times and have found their salads to be far more delicious than their pizza... I especially like their quinoa/goat cheese/beet concoction... mmmm. The last time I had Sauce, we got the lasagna pizza, which sounds amazing buuuut was just ok. Anyway, I would come back for their summer special, but I think there are better pizza places for the money in the central Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This place is a fast food restaurant.... I just don't understand why their prices don't reflect this. The BF and I went in here last night to get the summer sampler, and we were excited to try this new place for less money. Well what we paid was STILL too much for what we got. We ordered the caprese salad, a pizza with pepperoni and arugula, and two glasses of chardonnay. The caprese salad was not what was expected. Usually it's just basil, tomato, mozz, balsamic, and evoo. This was a salad (like lettuce) with hidden chunks of mozz and tomato in it, as well as some soggy pieces of bread. The mozz was the most flavorless mozz cheese I have had in a long time.... not so good. Otherwise, the salad was a plain old salad, but not what I wanted when I ordered it.... oh well. The pizza came out ridiculously fast. This leads me to believe that they are all sitting back there made and waiting to be shoved in the oven real quick and brought out. Our pizza had some spots that were covered in black burnt crust and some that seemed like they'd barely been in an oven (droopy, chewy, meh tasting). The pizza also lacked a lot of flavor, the sauce was almost non existent in taste, and it could have been a frozen pizza for how it tasted. The wine we got was also not pleasant.... although, chardonnay is not my usual wine, I have had it and this was particularly bad. The people who work there were very friendly, however, so that is a plus. I suppose if you want expensive fast food pizza....come here. For 'italian' style pizza, there are just too many other (good) restaurants in the valley to waste your time here."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch but probably would pass on dinner. Had the spinach, goats cheeser and pancetta salad with a tasty light dressing. Also tucked into a cheese and basil pizza which was thin crusted and light - just what I wanted! It's a bit of a hike from Chandler but if you are close check it out."}
{"text":"Travis was killing it! While all the other employees were sitting around.. Travis was taking orders, defusing situations, and packing to-gos. He was the only one working and I have worked in a restaurant and can tell you how frustrating it is when all your coworkers are sitting around doing nothing and you're working your ass off to keep customers happy. Give this man a raise and fire the scumbags who say \"they aren't good at the cash register\" train your employees. Was super unhappy with the service but Travis was an A+ and the food is always good... although I have been noticing that the quality of the food has been slipping.. Step your game up Sauce I used to love your place."}
{"text":"Located in a popular shopping plaza, Sauce is a nice option for a quick lunch and a glass of wine.My wife and I stopped in on a Sunday at lunch time. The restaurant was about half full. There is outside seating. Since the weather was perfect for alfresco dining, We got one of the last tables outside.   On your way to order, you walk past this huge blackboard with the menu items listed on it. When I got to the counted I ordered an Italian panini. This is turkey, ham, cheese, lettuce, and roasted tomatoes drizzled with vinaigrette on a lightly toasted bun. It came with a side of potato chips. My panini was brought to my table in a reasonable amount of time.The sandwich was alright. Not bad for the price, but not stellar. The chips were Lay's or something similar. The waitress did come by several times to check on us and clear any dishes. My wife got a salad which came with a dinner roll. She avoids gluten so she gave it to me. I could have played hockey with that thing. No one with dentures could have eaten it.   If I do return I am interested in trying one of their signature pizzas and a glass of wine, The pizzas are unique and the wine list adequate."}
{"text":"I always forget about this place! I need to frequent it more often! Always great food, clean restaurant and relaxed atmosphere. I had a mistake with my order and the employees were so accommodating, the manager even came and brought me my new pizza. EXCELLENT example of customer service, I was very impressed."}
{"text":"I found Sauce on a weekend trip to Tucson, and was thrilled when I found out they had Valley locations. I've eaten at the one on Thunderbird, the one in the east valley and the one on Camelback&Scottsdale, the one on Camelback being my favorite. The pizza is WONDERFUL and so are the salads. The gem of the place (as long as you're willing to splurge on calories) is the Mac&Cheese - which is outright phenomenal.  Highly recommended for the casual atmosphere, fast service, great food."}
{"text":"I normally love Sauce, but I had the worst experience here on Memorial Day.  If that would have been the first time I ate here, I definitely wouldn't have ever returned.   I went to eat with my boyfriend around 5:30pm.  The restaurant was not busy.  However, the service was super slow.  I ordered the side of pasta shells with chicken and he ordered soup and a sandwich.  His was brought out first.  He ate slowly trying to wait for me, but after at least 10-15 minutes his food was getting cold as he waited for my simple dish to be finished.  I'm not sure why it was taking so long since it wasn't busy.  I finally went up to the manager, a lady who was walking around not doing a damn thing. (There was actually a guy in front of me complaining about how long it was taking to get his food too)  I told her that my order hadn't come out after waiting 20 minutes and that my boyfriend's food was now cold because he has been waiting to eat WITH me.  She was so flustered and said she'd find out.  She brought it to me a minute later and said she was sorry but that she couldn't control her staff.  WHAT?!?  How unprofessional!  I couldn't believe that she was blaming her kitchen staff, especially to a customer.  Maybe you shouldn't be a manager if you can't get your staff to work together.  She did offer me a slice of dessert that I took to go.  I got a slice of cheesecake.  It was awful.  Very dry.  So you would think that since I just got this dish right from the kitchen it would be super hot, right?  Nope, no steam coming up.  I tasted it and it was luke warm!  How is that possible?  How long has this been sitting out?  I also paid for extra chicken and I am not kidding when I say there were only 4 small pieces of shredded chicken at the bottom of the cup.  Normally there is so much chicken added, but today it was non-existent.  I couldn't even be bothered to talk to the manager again.  Also, it was really messy inside.  Most tables had crumbs and hadn't been wiped down.  We ended up moving tables because we were right under the AC vent and both chairs I sat in were covered in crumbs that I had to wipe off.  Such a disappointment since I had my heart on eating here today."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite places to eat out. Everything is 5 star from the courteous, friendly service, calming, pleasant atmosphere, to the delicious, unique, tasty food. We love the lasagna, pepperoni & crimini pizza, chicken & pine nuts salad, and Tuscan tomato soup. Whether dining in, eating on the patio, or getting our food to go, we have never had a bad experience. That is really says something as we eat here all the time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE Fox restaurant fan.  Huge. (I think it's because of the time I spent in their birthplace of Tucson)  Did you know that Sauce has $3 wine specials from time to time?  Nice. I'm a big fan of the entire menu.  The salads are delicious and filling.  2 new salads are available for the winter (see my uploaded photo of the menu).    Service is quick and friendly.  My personal favorite menu items are:  Chicken, Spinach & Apple Salad, side of Mac n Cheese (for when you just want some kid food!), Salmon & Kale salad, and the Wild Mushroom & Truffled Arugula pizza"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The chicken and pine nut salad is fabulous, as well as the chicken pesto pizza, for my not-as-healthy days. Other pizzas are also good and the roast beef panini. The chocolate chip cookies are fabulous!   The restaurant is very clean and the staff very friendly. I actually pick up food more than I dine in and I am always impressed with how they repeat your order back to you and show you everything before you leave with it so you know your order is correct. I'm here at least twice a month!"}
{"text":"So glad we found Sauce to eat before the movie. It's always quick and Always delicious!"}
{"text":"My friend works across the street from the Happy Valley plaza so we frequently meet in the area for dinner. Sauce is usually the first place I suggest since I prefer it far more than the other (crappy) chains nearby. The pizzas and salads are good, the prices are right and the atmosphere is nice & casual. Service is pretty good considering they don't have a \"real\" waitstaff.   Just noticed two pizzas that I'll have to try next time: wild mushroom + truffled arugula and prosciutto + melon."}
{"text":"Love this place, mainly For the Mac n cheese (fanatic). Sometimes I have come in and a girl at the front with dark hair has given me attitude for no reason, doesn't greet me, and/Or doesn't smile.   This location recently hired a blonde girl with glasses (forgive I don't have anyone's names), but from the first time she took my order, to this next one about a week later, her customer service is outstanding. She's very bright and kind, doesn't make you feel judged, and makes sure you have everything you need. I was a server for 2 years and know the effect this has on a restaurant.   Giving sauce on camelback /central , and the new girl, 5 stars. :-)  For future employees, you are our experience, and sometimes being positive spreads to others, enough to where they leave reviews like mine!!"}
{"text":"They have the best tomato soup I have ever encountered. I also really enjoyed their Caprese bruschetta. Pretty good pizza (last time it tasted pretty dough-y to me), not one of the best that I've had, but good for the price."}
{"text":"Very good for a fast food style restaurant.  I enjoyed the Quinoa Salad without the cheese.  Seems like a popular place for families."}
{"text":"Very delicious food without long waits! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Yes.  I love this joint. Incredible pizza and my personal favorite quinoa salad with white beets (thought I hated beets until I tried this version),goat cheese and pistachios. De-licious!  Hubby gets to eat the various pies and sandwiches and I get my favorite salad with a nice glass of merlot for only $5.   Nice ambiance and great service. Another one if my Fox favorites."}
{"text":"I like Sauce, a lot. I like that for a 'quick-meal' place, they have a menu with a ton of variety. I like the brick oven pizzas, with that charred edge. The cheese they use is delicious. They have a new thicker hand-stretched crust, which is pretty good if you're offended by their normal thin crust. The hand stretched also appears to be a little larger, and is more filling than the thin crust, so it's good to share.  The white bean and potato soup is the reason why I only try to come here on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Yes, it is THAT good.  The pasta, salads, panini's are all good too. And they have a decent wine selection.   In the summer they offer great dinner deals. I believe last summer was a pizza, a salad and 2 glasses of wine for $20. Seriously, thats a steal and a half dot com."}
{"text":"This is a fairly competent restaurant that tries to be more than it is... With the PeiWei style cafeteria ordering process, it is difficult to pull off the trendy-chic branding they are reaching for with the low rent seating, ordering and service model. However, with all that said, the food is tasty and well prepared!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try and send them a message on here but they have messages off.   I ordered the chicken Caesar salad and not only was my lettuce mostly brown they literally gave me this much dressing for the whole salad. I was on a lunch break and didn't have time to go back.   Also, they only have one operational bathroom at this time. I'm a huge proponent of gender neutral bathrooms but they only have one bathroom for the whole restaurant and that's a cluster during lunch."}
{"text":"Went with a large party after church last Sunday afternoon. The service was EXCELLENT and the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food. Definitely one of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"Salad was 3.5, pizza at 2.5.  We had the 20 dollar pizza/salad special.  I thought the price was very reasonable. We had the caprese salad and the sausage pepperoni pizza. the salad was good, albeit a very different take than how capresse is usually served.  However, it was good. The pizza was disappointing. It was greasy, and just not particularly great.  I would rather eat at Zpizza than here.  The restaurant concept is nice, the service was good, and the ambiance was adequate. However, I don't think I would go back to eat pizza."}
{"text":"Sauce is perfect if you want to grab a quick bite while shopping. The staff is super friendly and Yelp check-in gives you 10% off the bill.   We ordered a salad and pizza to share. They split the salad for us too. The Quinoa beet and arugula salad was really tasty. The dressing is spot on, seasoned perfectly without overpowering main ingredients. The suprema pizza on thin crust was yummy as well, slightly greasy from all the pepperoni and sausage topping. The onions and mushrooms balance out the grease nicely.   There's plenty of seats inside and out. The staff came around often to keep all the areas clean."}
{"text":"Fox restaurants sold this division of there restaurants. Good spot for salads pastas and of course pizzas. Their signature pizzas are a good value cooked to order and I prefer these pies over the new style of pizza making with unlimited toppings and sauces. Something like Fired Pie or Pieology. I think they do a better job here"}
{"text":"This is one of my fave Italian places in the area.  It's one of the Fox concept restaurants--which all seem to be pretty good from my experience.  Cute inside - brick walls, kinda dark, you order at the register and they bring the food to your table.  I really love their salads and pizzas.  My fave salad is the Vegetable Salad, which is basically a bunch of chopped fresh veggies (corn, cucumbers, carrots, avocado, etc.) served over a bed of mixed greens with tangy dressing and a roll on the side.  Even my friend who \"hates vegetables\" loves this salad!  Pizza-wise, they all come on a thin, crispy crust which is nice because you don't feel like you need to be rolled out the door after you eat.  I really like the Portobello & Artichoke and the Mozzarella, Fontina, & Basil pizzas but have heard from my carnivorous friends that the ones with meat are also pretty good.  I'm always too full for dessert but I'd imagine they're tasty, as everything I've ordered in the past has been good here.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Always great service and love the Summer $20 special. Sauce is one of the few places that serves Naked Snowqualmie Reisling--and it's delicious with a Chicken Pinenut Salad along side their pizza--ANY pizza, in fact. Our family eats here at least 1x each week--especially for our Wednesday Family Movie Night!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to say how extremely disappointed I am with my order. I placed an order for delivery and first off I ordered the supreme pizza and only got a pizza with mushrooms and onions. Second I ordered the broccoli cheese and chicken pasta with extra sauce, well there's no extra sauce and the pasta is undercooked. Every time I pass by this restaurant it looks so intriguing and thought I would get something at least decent but this uncooked pasta???  Very disappointed customer"}
{"text":"I don't think you can go wrong with anything at Sauce.  This place is one of my go to favorites.  They also have gluten free pizza crust as an option.  Good food and consistently good service."}
{"text":"My only disappointment w/ Sauce was that while the food was good - it wasn't as great as the menu's hyped it to be.  Why would I mention that first?  Because after reading the menu online I was WAY into the place (expectations up), then I read the reviews (expectations slightly down, but still high), I then heard rave reviews from a friend (shooting expectations up) so I suppose I was expecting something above and beyond what I got.  Mind you - it was still pretty good.  I'm actually looking forward to making the trip again.  My sandwich was good - though I hardly tasted any pesto and my cheese was not melted (On a pannini - it should be melted) - but not amazing.  The pizzas looked great and I'm anxious to try one.  Soup and salad was good, but quite simple - nothing outstanding once again.  That said, great location, good parking.  We were one of only 2 other tables at 11:30 but by 12:30 when we left the place was packed so my advice is to go early or late if you want a really good experience.    Though it's been stated that it's a \"order at the counter\" kind of place, folks regularly came around to pick up extra plates and provide drink refills which was a nice unexpected touch.  It's a nice option for lunch - but it's also in an area of many Good, Nice, Great and even Amazing lunch spots.  So while there are \"better\" spots to go in the area, this isn't ever going to be a bad choice - especially during non-peak hours."}
{"text":"This place reminds me a little like the Italian restaurant, Pompeii, in Chicago where my roommate and I ordered food from there quite a bit. We ordered carry out from here. I wonder since I was visiting her here in Phoenix, she thought about getting us food from this place. I did deviate from what we typically order and got the Salami, Turkey, Ham and Mozzarella panini. It had a red wine vinaigrette that made it taste really good. The ingredients appear to be fresh and well packaged. The prices seemed average to me from Chicago standards, but unsure if it's pricey for the area here. I wouldn't mind trying out some other items here."}
{"text":"Where is 2470 W Happy Valley Rd.  It's not near the large 2480 number on the building in the middle of the block on the north side of the street."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this a 3.5!  It's a wonderful place for a quick lunch - but this is not a place I would frequent for dinner due to atmosphere and menu choices, hence the lower rating.  If you're a fan of the walk up and order establishments, this would be a prime contender.  Now for the food!  I'm not a huge fan of their pizzas.  They taste great with gourmet ingredients - thin crust, but there are so many other pizza joints I would suggest first.  What I do love and highly suggest are their salads.  I think my favorite would have to be the caprese, which is actually a standard salad with lettuce, pieces of tomato and fresh mozzarella mixed in, an amazing balsamic vinaigrette, and to top it off... lightly crunchy buttered/oiled croutons made from their fresh bread.    My second choice salad is the chicken/gorgonzola/tomato/pine nut one.  Fresh light dressing makes this a summer time delight.    Their bruschetta is also great, but expect them to be small in portion, very individual, not shareable as an appetizer really.  Great flavors!  Paninis and pasta also are a large portion of the menu, but alas, I have not tried any of these yet!  In all, a great place to grab a quick bite with good food aimed to please.  If you're familiar with restaurants like Noodles n Co or Cosi, this is right in line.  Not quite what I expected from a FOX creation, but yummy.  p.s. their triple chocolate cookies (plain cookie dough, dark, milk, white chips) are way worth $1 more.  Make sure to take advantage of them because I am addicted even though I don't really love chocolate!"}
{"text":"Met the family here for lunch today and although I'm not in love with their pizza, my uncles both really liked theirs. Mom had a beet and quinoa salad and loved it! My cousin had a panini and mac n cheese, both of which he really enjoyed and I had a seasonal salad with arugula, watermelon, sunflower seeds and feta. It was seriously delish!! Here's the weird thing, my friend went to use her Fox gift card and the manager said they were no longer affiliated with FRC.....who knew?? She was very accommodating though, she was able to change the FOX card into a Sauce card so that was really nice. A server came over and checked on us a few times, refilled drinks and picked up empty plates so if you go....don't forget to tip these folks!!"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing, healthy, staff are always nice.  Place is clean, well run. Always comes out fast.  Will be back."}
{"text":"You always know what you're getting with one of these Fox Concept restaurants, but I had a great customer service experience the other night. I needed to grab some dinner real quick, but I knew most places were closed already. I showed up at Sauce at 9:05PM, and they closed at 9. I opened their front door anyway, and asked if they were still serving. They said \"No,\" so I turned around and walked out as I had expected. Then about 10 seconds later, another person working there chased after me and said \"Hey, maybe we can help you, what are you ordering & we'll see if we can still make it.\" I was getting a pretty simple chicken salad to-go, so they said it wouldn't be a problem, and they'll have it ready for me as quickly as possible. They made it fresh, and I was ecstatic that they stayed a little later then they had to in order to make me happy."}
{"text":"Nice, fresh take on a tired concept. Kudos to new ownership & looking forward to this concept going to the next level!"}
{"text":"Food is a good value but the service is absolutely terrible.  Ordered a salad and pizza for my wife and I.  It was quite busy when we arrived on Sunday, but this is not unusual for this place.  We got our pizza in about 15-20 minutes but had to ask about the salads.  The salads arrived about 8 minutes later and was drenched in salad dressing.  We asked about the roll they usually bring with the salad and almost 10 minutes later we were told they would be out of the over shortly.  As we finished our lunch we are them bringing rolls around, but missed us.  By this time the restaurant had thinned out quite a bit and we shrugged and left.   While the pizza was great, the salad would have been sent back had we had wanted to wait another 10 minutes for it.   The service was absolutely terrible and will make me think twice about returning."}
{"text":"We used to love this place and always made a point to eat here when visiting family; surprised to find out ownership had changed beginning of the year.  Along with that change, the food quality has changed as well - we ordered three salads for lunch today, all were heavy on the olive oil to the point of looking (and tasting) greasy.  My sister's chicken salad had just a little bit of shredded chicken that looked soaked in the oil :-(.  I'm afraid we won't be coming here again especially with so many good restaurants in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food is good but the portions aren't very generous for the price.  I ordered a salad to go for the 1st time and it seemed about half the size of the dine-in size.  Oh well, maybe I just eat too much."}
{"text":"Notice that all the pictures of the food look great on yelp.  Then notice all the pictures were taken by the business owner.  Think he puffed up the food to make it look better?  Think the customer is going to get the same thing? hahaha.  Only someone dumb enough to vote for Hillary could --well be that dumb."}
{"text":"Sauce is pretty good. I give it a solid 3 stars, because it's named for it's Pizza, but that's where they lack.  Sauce has some great chopped salads. It's the only thing I'll get here. The portions are generous. A bit pricey, but but an overall good salad.  The pizza is like eating cheese and crackers. Not impressed. There's something about a pizza so thin crusted and lacking so many toppings that makes me want to bust out the lunchables instead of waste my money here.  If its lunch or dinner time, don't expect to find a table. People love this place. Not sure why."}
{"text":"First time here, very confusing setup upon arrival. Busy Friday night, with disorganized chaos regarding servers, available tables, requesting additional service needs with overall fast food appeal environment. Ordered chx spinach Apple salad, which was decent. Chx pesto pizza was okay but took long as well as asking for \"sauce\". We spoke to atleast 6 various workers throughout our experience. Price was reasonable however."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is \"so-so\" but the food is surprisingly delicious for the money. The chicken broccoli cheese pasta is light and flavorful. The goat cheese bruschetta is also worth checking out it you like earthy, acidic flavors. Lastly, the pizza is good but not amazing. The crust is VERY thin- almost cracker-like, would recommend as an appetizer. They also serve beer and wine which is a definite plus."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is fast casual, minus the fast part. I have been here several times due to its proximity to work but I find that the time it takes to get your food is not conducive to a work day lunch. They also do not offer pizza by the slice so if I am by myself grabbing a quick bite I go for a panini (which are just ok) and a side salad. They don't let you swap it for the chips so you have to pay extra for the salad and they don't let you get once of the \"fancy\" salads in a side portion.  Overall, I think the only time this place works is if you have some time to kill and a few other people with you so you can share a pizza and salad. But on those occasions I can think of half a dozen other places at the same price point that I would rather go to in the area with better food and ambiance. i.e. Fifth and Wine, Herb Box market, Olive and Ivy marketplace, Gelato Spot, etc. etc."}
{"text":"Sauce actually gets 2 1/2 stars from me, but I rounded it up to three because of the  Caprese salad.  The pizza is just OK, but you pay a premium price.  Sauce I felt was pretty expensive for what you get, especially for the service, which is the stand in line and order at the cash register then wait on your food type.  All of their pizzas are 12\", and most have one or two toppings.  Price for most pizzas is about $8-9.  I had the pepperoni and felt that it was short on sauce (ironic, huh), and they could have thrown a few more pepperoni on there.  I also got the Caprese salad, which was in a traditional salad form instead of what you'd normally expect, and it was excellent.  I'd definitely get that again.  The dining area seemed cold (aethstetically), crowded, and uncomfy.  While I wouldn't likely come here on my own again, I wouldn't protest if a group of friends wanted to go. Sauce isn't a bad place, I just didn't think it was that great.  I think you can find better pizza for less money."}
{"text":"Finally a pizza that competes with my Zpizza's personal concoctions. Stop by this place if you're a wine lover as well. They only have a few selections of wine and beer, but from what I've had they've been pretty tasty.   Mozzarella, Fontina cheese, and basil pizza. I can't help not to eat the whole thing when I go there. Hey! They're thin crust, and I'm a man with a huge appetite. I usually get take out, but the next time I go I'm dinning in with company."}
{"text":"Have ordered from this location numerous times however today my order was incorrect. I ordered my usual spinach chicken salad & chicken pesto pizza. Salad was salmon & kale (allergic to salmon) so had to toss salad. Pizza was cold."}
{"text":"Well Sauce hits the \"spot\" for me. I was amazed how quick the service is and how fast we get our pizza (well their  pizza does follow the laws of physics, THIN PIES COOK QUICK!). So if your're looking for deep dish....this is not spot. But if you like it thin, it's great. I tend to order the same item time and time again and it's the sausage with carmelized onions. Sandra K likes their salads, so it's a pizza and salad and we share. She likes a glass of red wine with her dinner. We share the pizza and salad (she won't let me drink her wine though) and I gotta tell you, it's plenty of food and I feel like I got real value for my money. Kudo's to Sauce!  This guy, Sam Fox, has a magic touch with most of his restaurantsl He is truly gifted by bringing his concepts to the greater Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Good takeout or dine in option. Lots of \"design your own\" pizza sauces and toppings. Variety of salad options. Several kids meal selections (mac and cheese was YUMMY!).   Order your food at the counter, grab a number and head to your table or wait for your take out.   Good option for an easy, moderately priced lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with family, and we always get the Mozzarella & Fontina Cheese & Basil Pizza to split (It's basically a margherita pizza, but it's pretty tasty).  The pizza is really yummy, but it's not the best pizza I've ever had.  This place is really good for pizza if your in the area, but I don't drink wine...so I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but It's great after a long day at Fashion Square."}
{"text":"Great gluten free pizza. The menu is a bit pricey in my opinion considering the fact that it is a retail shopping center and you are in a fast paced and open seating area."}
{"text":"I feel like the food and service was better when they were part of Fox Concepts but the quality seems to have fallen into more of a fast casual chain area.  The mac and cheese used to be THE dish, but my last experience was pretty weak.  The pizza is passable, but not great, and the service was forgetful.  As in, they seemed to forget about us.  I don't think I will go back to this location but I may try another.  This review would have been 4 stars a couple years ago."}
{"text":"This place is great! Their cheesy broccoli pasta is sooo delicious and it comes with a warm bread biscuit that goes great with the pasta. They were always really busy but we always found seating, they have an enclosed patio and they also offer gluten free crust for the pizza too. One time we had a waiter that was very strange and kind of rude and another worker came and apologized without us even having to complain and gave our friends meal for free. It's kind of like a slightly more fancy chipotle for pizza and pasta. You order and pay up front and then they bring the food out to you."}
{"text":"Knowing Sauce is part of the Sam Fox Restaurant group is part of the reassurance of a quality.  Order at the counter from a menu chalkboard with a good selection of pizza, salads and pasta.   I have had so much pizza lately that I will have to come back another time to try the huge selection of combinations.   This time we shared the lasagne,  meatball panini, pasta with meatballs and mac and cheese.  Each was very good and pretty small in size portions.  The decor is very simple with brick style walls and a drink dispenser.   Very simple and casual, reasonable in price and not the usual Sam Fox Restaurant.   Will come back to try other items and certainly the pizza."}
{"text":"Best quick food place out there.  Pizza is great! Salad is great! Cookies are amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I love coming here for a great pizza. Their customer service is great too. They've been so gracious when our order is late or slightly burnt they fix it right away. This is our staple date night for at least once a month."}
{"text":"I used to go to Panera Bread, now I come to Sauce, it is  fresh bigger size  and better pprice. Customer service s very good!."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing Italian food. This is not Olive Garden or Applebee's level of quality- this is very decent quality food. They appear to use wholesome ingredients and their wood-fired pizza is the bomb dot com.!!!"}
