{"text":"Tanja rocks the place. Great food and greater service. Newer tvs and pool table. Juke box and Keno. The flat bread pizzas are a perfect choice for something delicious and not heavy. The Lobster Bisque is one of the best around when it's available."}
{"text":"Kind of like Panini's trashy cousin. The best part is it's a decent place to play pool which is usually why we come. I've never had a good meal here. Everything is dry and covered in sauce. The drinks are watered down and the bartenders are not friendly (and the jerk to hotness meter is very skewed here: ugly broads/dudes with bad attitudes). Luckily there's a mediocre Panini's across the street now so save some time and money and just go to Panini's to reminisce and attempt to relive your slutty college years."}
{"text":"I was so incredibly happy to be visiting home over the holidays and stop by brubakers. My trip home would not have been complete without some Great Lakes Christmas ale with the sugar and cinnamon rim!!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and unsure where to go grab some food and a beer. This place was close to our hotel so we figured we would give it a shot. . . Was fantastic!  Food was great and surprisingly inexpensive.  Great happy hour prices! Great beer selection.  Staff was very friendly.  Would return for sure!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and good draft beer...all at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Recently stopped in here one evening driving by, had a fabulous bar maid named Emily (emmy). She made my drinks in a kick ass timely fashion, was incredibly friendly and a lot of fun to be around!  Everyone should stop in here and try it out!"}
{"text":"From other reviews I think this place is just about gathering and getting drunk.  You'd have to be drunk to appreciate their food. We stopped here for a late lunch of burgers and beer, then found that they only serve burgers on Thursday night?????  The beer selection was not great and the food was laughable.  A bowl of iceburg lettuce with fake bacon bits ,one slice of tomato, and marzetti dressing in a packet made up their house salad. The chili was out of a can and even the waitress agreed she didn't care for it.  My chicken quesadilla was a mediocre at best.  I don't even think they cook their own chicken.  We now know where not to stop!"}
{"text":"Where to start? 

Food: Crappy bar food. It's not for the faint at heart. They have a microwave and a toaster according to the waitress. So the selection is huge for what they have to cook with. If your here for the food, get out while you can!

Drink: Didn't have any due to driving 3 hours after eating here. The selection at least is the normal bar selection for domestics and imports. Crappy wine list and this places advertises as a Irish pub... Guinness is the only Irish beer they have, pretty sure the last Irish Pub I was at there was at least 15 Irish beers and scores of whiskey. 

Atmosphere: It's worst then a college bar. Enter at your own risk. The bartenders slam beer bottles into the trash can. 

Overall: Our bill was less then $20 for dinner. That alone will achieve a 1 star. If you in a hotel, drink and go. Skyline Chill has descent food and a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"My rating is not concerning the food. I wouldn't know what the food tastes like or whether or not it was good because we never got any. It was our first time and thought it looked good. It was also near our hotel and we were tired and didn't eat to travel far. We walked in and there was no sign or indication as to whether we should seat ourselves or wait. When a woman, I assume a waitress, finally said something we had been standing there several minutes. We would have asked someone but you couldn't tell the difference between patrons and employees. So we took a seat and prepared to order...only no one ever came to the table. After 10-15 minutes we were fed up and left. The woman we think was the waitress was now outside leaning in the bar talking to the bar tender out there. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Attempted to order drinks and food. Was instantly served drinks and given menu. Sat for over 30 minutes without a refill/new drink and without my order taken. Finally flagged down an employee to request an order to go. (Really wanted to try their Cuban Sandwich) the sandwich was subpar (not authentic) and the potato chips were terrible. Never again. First time is last time. Tell your male bartender to stop flirting and take my order."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews I would definitely agree with most of them. I sat at the bar. Didn't have bad service... AT ALL. So that's what gained them my 4th star.. Ordered potato pancakes. Not good at all. I'm not from around here, but if I was I would only come here for drinks. Decent place to drink and decent prices a"}
{"text":"The cheap, cheap beer is the only reason I give the 3rd star here.

The food is mediocre at best. Saying that the staff is inattentive is putting it mildly. They aren't usually all that busy but it's obvious that they would rather be anywhere but at work. It's rare to see the same employees twice so I assume that turnover is pretty high.

As I mentioned, dirt cheap draft beer. If you're staying at the Courtyard, you're within staggering distance of this place so $20 will go a long way here.

Ohio's weird smoking laws have created an unusual feature. These outdoor bars that are open on all but the coldest of nights. If you're a smoker, you can sit outside and still get food and dink brought to you while you smoke.

Oh, and they have Golden Tee Live. So bring two credit cards. One to open your tab and one to play the game."}
{"text":"Where the regulars go. The real key to this neighborhood pub is the service. Allot of bars have pretty bartenders, these ones actually care about their job and their customers."}
{"text":"This is my watering hole and I love it.  cheap, good people, and dollar hamburger and dollar beer thursday. need I say more"}
{"text":"By far the best service in area & the best looking female bartenders! They always make taking care of their customers top priority. Thx Jordan & staff"}
{"text":"Its Ok.  The food is ok.  The Beer selection is ok.  BUT the prices are awesome.  It's like a price time machine back to 1999!

I do like the setup.  A long curvy bar, with outside seating and many TVs.  Nice place to hang out.  And golden tee!"}
{"text":"For a strip mall bar, someone took care in lighting and styling this sliver of a bar. A \"classics\" pub decor of an Irish pub accomplished by having every other light on and dimmed. Ensuring that if it is daytime, you will have to squint from the sun stinging when you leave. I liked the fake stained glass lighting above the bar. With anymore light the cheesiness might show through. Through some miracle of physics they did fit darts and pool in the back of the pub. Enough TVs to go around also. 

I didn't have any food, but I enjoyed the atmosphere enough to post it. This is really a 2.5."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed, it didn't have much food to choose from just sandwiches, appetizers, & salads.  If you are somewhere for dinner this not the place to go.  The good is that it's clean and the price are good in other words a c&c clean and cheap.  This place is just good for lunch and hanging out to watch a sports and have drinks."}
{"text":"I appreciate the great service and fine food. The ambiance is distinctive and the servers are polite."}
{"text":"Very loud bar. Food was terrible.  Couldn't eat it. The bartenders were friendly.  Will definitely not stop back."}
{"text":"On 03-20-18 we went for lunch. The place looked clean and friendly and had six or eight patrons. Upon walking-in, there was an overwhelming odor of cleaning solution. We figured we could live with it because we were starving! We were then told (by a male bartender) to sit wherever we wanted. We sat for over twenty minutes before the male came to our table and asked what we wanted to drink. I ordered a Guinness and my partner ordered a mixed drink. After another wait, the male brought the drinks, put them on the table and walked-away. The Guinness was spilling all over the glass and table and tasted like Guinness flavored water. No server ever came to the table even as the place was essentially empty. We finally stopped the female bartender who was walking past. We politely asked for our check and she never asked if we were okay or inquired as to why we were leaving. We won't return there."}
{"text":"This is a very friendly and enjoyable Pub. The staff is attentive and available to make your experience memorable. The locals make you feel at home. When it comes to food the menu is simple but has the necessary tasty choices to satisfy a variety of appetites. Monitors everywhere to give electric ambiance and not to mention local sporting events. The outdoor patio is covered and heated when needed. I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This is a chain in Cleveland Area, the food is good 'bar' food and the portion are nice as well.  The beers are cheap and the price for a nice chicken sandwhich is reasonable.  Golden Tees in all the ones that I have been in..."}
{"text":"This is a bar not a restaurant. You have to walk through a cloud of smoke on the patio to get to the front door. I tried to eat here but it was an epic failure. The pretzels are lower quality than the frozen pretzels I used to buy from Walmart in college and they overcharged for these from the listed menu price. I ordered the Ruben and the first few bites were actually pretty good but then I pulled the hair out of my sandwich. But the do have pretty good drink happy hour specials. So like I said this is a bar, not a restaurant."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere decent bar food.  Lotta specials and everything is pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Cool place to relax and unwind. Friendly staff and service was great. Special shots are a must just all for the PBJ"}
{"text":"We've been here many times over the years. The flatbread pizza is good as is the Bavarian Pretzels. Better than average bar food and good selection of beers."}
{"text":"I have had a lot of drunken nights here!!  You can rack up a bill here pretty quickly after a couple of drinks so don't say I didn't warn ya.  They have some pool tables and plenty of tvs to catch the game.  As the night gets later be sure to pop a few dollars in the jukebox to hear your favorite tunes.  

The food here is solid bar food, although I only ever really came here for the booze.  They also have a great outdoor bar area if you can stand the smokers!!"}
{"text":"So.....not even close to a real Irish pub. The bartender filled my Guinness to the top and handed it to me. When I asked her if she knew how to pour a \"perfect pint\" I had to explain to her what that meant. She looked at me as if I were stupid and said, \"uh, we don't do that here\" and made it seem as if I were just being unreasonable. All in all, if you like rap music and beer pong, maybe this place is for you. If you want a real Irish pub, go somewhere else. Green lights and Guinness on tap that you pour incorrectly does NOT make you an Irish pub."}
