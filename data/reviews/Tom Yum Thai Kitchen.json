{"text":"It's a truly hidden gem in Galleria at Sunset! We had a bowl of beef noodle soup, beef bowl and boba tea! I like their boba. It's just perfect texture and sweetness. Noodle was good and Must be very good in cold season.  Beef bowl was good size and it was only $6.10. Pretty reasonable, right?  We will come back!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Definitely will be back!
Cute family owned restaurant and the prices are really good for the amount of food you get"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that this place opened up at galleria mall's food court! Now, whenever I get hungry while shopping I don't have to leave the mall just to find a good place to eat at. The food is so fresh, affordable and you don't have to wait long! The staff was friendly, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"So, I've been here 3-4 times and think I can give a honest review. This place is hit or miss. One day 5 stars the next 3. The curry is great one day...blah the next. Customer service varies...today there was no one at the counter...the first time I visited there was three people and they were outgoing and offering samples. Maybe that is why they are a mall location...I don't think they could make it in a strip mall. Overall...the food is good and worth trying. One of my favorites is the yellow curry...and on the right day is better than most Thai restaurants in town. I'm still a fan..."}
{"text":"Food was good, I guess I'm just not a Thai food lover. My friend said it was great. In the food court at Galleria, so
Kind of noisy, but clean."}
{"text":"Seriously you will be surprised there is a really good Thai restaurant inside of the food court"}
{"text":"This little gem is located in a food court but the food was really good. and inexpensive. You choose one, two or three entrees with your choice of fried rice or panang. All the entrees we tried had lots of meat and veggies and were really tasty and fresh. The soup we ordered was made fresh to order and was very good. The panang was far to sweet so I would choose the rice.  If  this was located in my home town I would be a regular."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to eat inside the food court at Galleria Mall. My family's go to is the Pad Thai, yellow curry and Thai sweet chilli chicken.  The do have really good pineapple rice.  Also don't forget to grab a Thai coffee way better then anything you get around the corner."}
{"text":"Generous with samples and portions for the price.  Quality food for a mall food court, but don't go in expecting the best Thai food you've ever had.  The \"spicy\" isn't the typical Thai spicy level but the flavor is pretty good.  The ginger chicken was the highlight but the basil chicken was the lowlight...Nothing bad, but just not that great.  Overall, this is your best choice while in the mall but don't go out of your way to go here.  They also have boba drinks."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. First time having Thai food and it couldn't had been any better.. Make sure you check them out when your in the galleria mall"}
{"text":"I have visited this locations 3 times and the last 2 visits have been disappointing. The server they have does not know there dishes or ingredients in them which is something I find inexcusable. In addition to that there food has been inconsistent being that there pork stew has over 95% tofu when previous has been pork. If there trying to cut food costs, or lack of ordering then it's the customer who is ultimately loosing. I hope the gm/owner reads this and resolves these issues and properly trains there staff to know what there serving and not trying to nickel and dime there customers."}
{"text":"The Panang Curry was delicious.  The price is extremely reasonable for the quality of the food.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tom Yum is in the Galleria Mall and despite that location, makes some damn delicious Asian fusion dishes. Though the name says \"Thai\" they also do a handful of Filipino and Chinese dishes too. I followed the staff here from their east side restaurant, JWok, and though they've changed to a cafeteria-style setup, their focus is still on putting out flavorful, home-style food with friendly family-owned service. 

I usually luck into seeing Jason when I stop by, and he hooks me up with whatever's freshest. The Tokyo style or Adobo beef, Asian Cajun garlic shrimp, and any of their curry options are always really good- their sauces are balanced and their proteins are fresh and juicy. Props for offering some vegan options, too. They also have fresh-made soups, along with a few apps and a bunch of boba drinks for those just looking for a snack. I really like their honey boba but my friend swears by their coconut milk tea with pudding. Lots of great stuff in this small mall spot!"}
{"text":"Family owned!!! Never see that in a mall.. the food is delicious!! Highly recommended for the food and the wonderful service! The girl who helped us, Delilah, was also very sweet as well."}
{"text":"If you are ever hungry at Galleria Mall, go here. 
The Tokyo Beef tastes like a hug from your mom, the rice is always perfectly fluffy, and the boba is sweet and made with real fruit. Everyone that works here is super nice and makes you feel like you've known them forever. 

TL;DR: The best food ever."}
{"text":"I CREATED A YELP ACCOUNT JUST TO SAY HOW GREAT THIS FOOD IS! I saw a new, little restaurant in the food court at the Galleria Mall and had to try it. I loved everything I tried. Please everyone, if you are in the area, stop in and experience THIS! My taste buds are going through a flavor explosion with every bite. OMG! #neverhadfoodlikethisomg. This is better than my mother's cooking!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and it was very nice gesture to give us samples!  I like their pad Thai and smoothie. Their boba is tender and has very right sweetness.   Price is great.  I will come back for sure!

Updating 7/15/17

I had Tokyo beef, gyudon, and TOM yum noodle.  I loved both and Boba was always the best!"}
{"text":"What a surprise! I have passed up trying this place because in the past, every fast-food counter thai place was terrible. The gal offered me samples, and I'm so glad she did. As far as fast food Thai goes, this place is great and not too overpriced. Glad there's finally something decent to eat at the Galleria food court."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is amazing!!! The food here so cheap and delicious. I love it and will recommend my friends to come eat here."}
{"text":"Not only was the food delicious but the staff was AMAZING!!! Not only did the young lady behind the counter let my friend, who had never had Thai food before, try just about every dish before ordering, but I left my phone at the counter and she actually tried to track me down in the mall to bring me the phone. My boyfriend called my cell phone and she answered and was already half way to the store we were in. Definitely going above and beyond on their customer service!!!"}
{"text":"This place sell Boba, food is great (they got chicken adobo), and the price is affordable (under 10$). Customer service was amazing. Jason was very friendly to go over the food with samples and the price is reasonable. Indeed coming back here to try out other dish"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best place for Boba drinks. Food is also very tasty especially the panang curry. Would love to come back."}
{"text":"Yum! I love my strawberry banana boba smoothie :) my mom ordered a honeydew boba and they use real melon! I'll be back. Everyone was so sweet"}
{"text":"Boba in the Galleria Mall? Yes! Finally there is some quality boba to be had whilst shopping in the Galleria Mall. Tom Yum has a variety of boba options and plenty of Thai food items including roti! Since we were going to eat after shopping we opted to just get a boba. We chose the Thai tea with boba and the strawberry smoothie with boba. The boba had a good consistency and was not hard or overly chewy. I rate both drinks 4/5. There menu items exceptionally good for mall food. We will definitely be back to try a bite. 

They have a frequent drink buyers card with buy 6 get the 7th free. Interesting as most places its buy 10 get 1 free. They have one size drink for boba and smoothies. There are also some specials like Thai Sunset, Bangkok Night, Squirrels Dream with Nutella, Cooklies and Cream Oreo and Wimbeldon with strawberries and cream. You can opt for popping boba or regular."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of food courts, but you've got to love the Galleria's because of the variety and not the same chains that you see at other malls. I typically go for the Greek food, but today I decided to try Tom Yum Thai Kitchen, and I'm glad I did. 
The server was very friendly describing the dishes to me. I love Tom Kai soup but decided to try an entr√©e. I had the Basil Chicken with vegetables and pad thai, all three items were flavorful, delicious and fresh! I also asked for a sample of the yellow curry and they were glad to do so. Yep, that is what I will order on my next visit. Creamy and bursting with flavor. Great food, great service.  Definitely stop here on your next visit to the mall. Your taste buds and tummy will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Solid food option at the mall for once. The quality is good ( Siam Beef is my favorite ). The bubble teas are amazing as well, I am picky with were I get my taro, but this place manages to get it right every time. The best part is, the staff are friendly and fast as well which is what I look for when i'm trying to run in and out of the mall."}
{"text":"Pleasantly Surprised.  Pad thai was delicious but not overly heavy.  I love thai food but find myself having to take a nap over the heavyness of the food due to the oil.   Not so at tom yum.  Both the ginger chicken and pork maintain an at home taste hard to find while dining out.  The food is fresh and tasteful without being overbearing.  I also appreciated the pad thai not being overly sweet."}
{"text":"??????????

{"text":"This has to be the best mall food my wife and I have eaten in any mall. We split a 3 entree combo which consisted of panang chicken, spicy basil chicken and beef stew with steamed rice. We pondered over 5 minutes trying to decide which ones to eat after the lady had us try each entree sample. The portions were just right since we had leftovers. Before eating here all the Thai food we ever had consisted of panang beef and pad Thai. I'm glad to have had these variety and to have tasted all of them. I highly recommend anyone who love a kick of spice and Asian food to try Tom Yum Thai Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Great service, a hot bar that serves the classics. One of the best pad ja pows around. Great chicken yellow curry!! Definitely worth giving your business too. I paid 8$ and got 15$ worth of food from any other Thai place."}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars because they tried pretty hard to accommodate my dietary preferences. I asked for no animal products and no oil and although they had to think about it they did a great job. I had to wait 7 minutes for them to prepare it so no big deal. I didn't know a food court vendor would be so nice. Many thanks to these nice people."}
{"text":"This is the best boba tea you'll find in Vegas! The squirrel's dream and Thai tea are 2 of my favs. 
I also love the pad thai and panang curry combo on the menu.
The staff is awesome and always willing to go the extra mile. 
I always make it a point to visit them while shopping at the mall, excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.  Authentic Thai at a food court.  Inexpensive as well.  Ordered the Tom Yum with shrimp.  Made fresh.  Not just heated up in a microwave.  Will definitely have to try their other selections on the next visit."}
{"text":"This place is like Panda Express' Thai counterpart!  It's fast food Thai, and it is what all malls are missing.  You can select a side with an entree like Panda's.  Price goes up depending on how many entrees you choose.  Sides include Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Steamed Rice.  I usually go with the Pad Thai, which is okay, not like what you would expect in a restaurant, but put a little hot sauce on it and yum!  All the curries I've tried there are good!  Also the beef stew was good, meat was tender.  I haven't really strayed away too much from those items, but heard good things about some of the other choices.

Who I think might be the owners are really nice, as well as the other staff.  They always offer samples!  I've tried their boba drink samples and they have been yummy, but never treated myself to one, but one day!  I love grabbing a bite here when at this mall.  Quick, easy, nice people, cheap good food!  Can't lose!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I was so happy to finally see a Thai Fast Food place at a mall Food Court. I was just thinking a couple of months ago that malls should have Thai Fast Food and was extremely happy to see one at the Galleria mall. The food is restaurant quality and they do their best to keep it fresh even if it is fast food setting or the fact that it is fast food. Prices are comparable and maybe even a little cheaper to other cuisines in the same location but taste and quality I think surpasses since it wasn't salty or have the mass production quality to it. I may be partial to Thai food since it's one of my top favorite cuisines but in general I think it is definitely a good choice at the Galleria Mall Food Court. Staff was really great, friendly and to my kids, helpful, and very gracious. It was clean, presentable, and overall A+. Whether you like Thai food or not, or even if I gave it rave reviews, I suggest for all to try it and see for yourself. They have different entree  options that I think caters to different preferences. And even if Galleria Mall is not the closest mall to me, I would most likely choose going there since they now have this option. I ordered the Siam Beef, Yellow Curry, and side of Pad Thai and White Rice, and topped it with yummy and legit Thai Tea. All tasted good. Looking forward to the next time I go there and try other things."}
{"text":"So glad this place is close by! If you want a quick Thai and boba fix without the wait and you also feel Panda Express is too salty for the day, try this place out! Had the pad thai and egg plant tofu. Flavors weren't overwhelming which I liked. Their boba was chewy and the drink wasn't too sweet."}
{"text":"I'm very impressed with this section of the food court in the mall! They have many traditional Thai foods to offer! Out of all the outlets in the food court at Galleria mall I'd say this is the most delicious! I ordered Pad Kra Pao with Thai Iced Tea with boba and it was all so scrumptious. The two ladies helping me were so sweet and welcoming!"}
{"text":"I was in the food court at the mall and I noticed this new restaurant! It's set up really clean. You can choose to eat what you see. All the food is fresh and hot. I had the basil chicken with noodles and the flavor was on point meat was fresh as it looked! Prices are fair too. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"The food here is great! The portion size is decent. Both Curry's are full of flavor with just the right amount of spicy ness! Lumpia is ok. They give pad Thai as a side for the entree and it's delicious. Eat here :)"}
{"text":"It was my first experience to try out tom yum thai kitchen. Jason was very pleasant to go over the menu with me and my boyfriend. The customer was outstanding, they gave us samples to try it out first, and most of the food was good. So We decided to get the tom yum noodles, two entree plate and two ice blended boba. The food is amazingly delicious, i love the hot and sour tom yum noodles, the pad thai that came with the plate, and the chicken curry was so good. The ice blended was so refreshing, the boba is fresh (you can tell from the texture if the boba fresh or not, if u r a boba lover). The price was reasonable, pretty good for the portion. This is gonna be my to go thai food place. Definitely  coming back to try out other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Love the pin3apple rice SO YUMMY. The Thai yellow curry mixed with the rice is the best!! Very good prices for the amount of food and quality of food they make. I hope they stick around for a long time!"}
{"text":"Amazing curry!  Wish they had a vegetable curry available but they curry itself is full of flavor! Can't believe this is from a mall food court!"}
{"text":"Ate here Thanksgiving night for the Black Friday sales. The staff was amazing, super friendly and helpful with reccomendations. The lady helping me was so sweet. She asked me if I was Thai. The Thai food here is decent, but not my go to. I had the Pad Ka Pao (spicy basil chicken) made with ground chicken. They have Filipino Adobo as well. Both were decent."}
{"text":"the food made me very sick. 
my order was not correct, even after calling to let me know they didnt have an item. i give it 2 stars for the effort of the friendly guy who called to see what id like instead. he tried. 
the food arrived with the containers broken in so there was plastic in my food. probably not best to stack them up and just use a few bags. will not eat here again because i became ill."}
{"text":"Galleria Mall I swear has the best food court eatery compared to all the other malls. Just my opinion. 

I wanted to jump the gun and give this place 5 stars, but I prefer to hold a star as this place is  the newest edition to this food court. While I personally did not order from here (aside from eating all the samples I was given)...I was the one in line ordering for my fab5. We were immediately greeted and literally bombarded with samples from the older lady (who is the owner by the way). I swear my 3 year old was nearly full off of samples with his tiny tummy. Lol. 

Anyway, what reaaallllly stood out for me was how the owner just seemed very homely, like a grandma...from wanting you to sample, to how she served us, and how she noticed that one of our plates could use more rice because she said the jambalaya is pretty spicy so we will need more rice to soak it up. Hahaha. Oh, and how she added more soup over my fam's  rice. Having more sauce or soup poured over our rice with more rice being added is like a Filipino's dream that we didn't know could exist in a food court?! 

You will be impressed over how good and the quality of it you are getting from here. Note people...Thai food in a food court?! It was delicious! I sampled two out of the 3 dishes because the jambalaya has shrimp in it and that's a no-go for me. They were each flavorful, fresh tasting, and the meat was of quality. 

More so, the pricing is very fair and reasonable. My husband has been craving the Thai jambalaya since then. The jambalaya per the husband has a good spice to it, not too spicy...but my husband loves heat in his food so I'm not sure every person will speak the same. He was impressed of how much shrimp and sausage he got in that one serving.

 It is a drive for us but we would literally come here knowing we can shop and eat good in one stop. I think they are worth the try if you are in the vicinity or in the building and are hunnnngary.

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Sooooo disappointed. Ordered from Uber Eats and the portion sizes were RIDICULOUSLY small. For both the basil chicken and fried rice with chicken. The fried rice came with three shrimp. These were basically appetizers, not entrees."}
