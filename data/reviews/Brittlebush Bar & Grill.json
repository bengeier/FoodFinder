{"text":"The chicken waffle sliders were tremendous and the mahi mahi tacos were delicious too!  Plus the complimentary bread pudding dessert rounded off lunch nicely."}
{"text":"Standard hotel bar and grill fare.  Appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, etc. offered at hotel prices (read: higher than regular restaurant prices.)    I had the clubhouse salad which was fairly tasty, but the chicken was a bit dry.  A side of french fries was served in a tall cylinder with 2 dipping sauces.  The service is top notch; it's obvious the Westin takes time to train their staff."}
{"text":"Steak tacos all day long...they are so good!! Bartenders are friendly. The only downside is that is a small area."}
{"text":"The food is really good.  Had the Scottish Sandwich.  My fiancee's soup had a hair in it, but we pushed it aside.  It's just hair, right?  

The service was really slow, and not at all good.  I've never tipped less than 15% in my life, but there's a first for everything.  The server came over after somebody else got out drinks, took the order, brought it out, and dropped off the check.  I'm not sure if he did anything else.  

The view of the golf course makes this place 2 stars.  Skip the expensive hotel restaurants and go to another place nearby."}
{"text":"Situated on the golf course of the The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa, this place is a great location to enjoy a lazy (in a good way) lunch with family and friends.   It has a very warm and cozy feel along with fabulous mountain and golf course views out their floor to ceiling windows.

The menu is definitely contemporary and has something for everyone.

We enjoyed the crispy honey-walnut shrimp.  They are designed to be lettuce wraps, but i think the crispy shrimp were sooo tasty that they stood pretty good alone (tapas style).  It was Very Sweet and Very Crispy.
I also had the lunch salmon.  The salmon was perfectly cooked.  Very moist and just past pink in the middle.  It had a citrus vinegrette and a very light salad.  It was a very petite piece of salmon for the price, that is my only gripe.

Parking is ample - save room for dessert and tell me how it is...We didn't make it that far as we were very full!"}
{"text":"I have gone here for 9 straights years. The service is top notch. When you come in they seat you right away, and the server always checks on your table every 5 minutes. The menu is great, so many selections to choose from. The food is fresh and outstanding! You should try the award-winning \"French Onion Soup\". What a amazing selection of IPA Beers they also have. I also love the decor. They serve lunch and dinner. Highly Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We had the best service by Andrew. He made our stay at the Westin all the more pleasurable! The food was great! Ask for Andrew when you go!"}
{"text":"I bought a discount certificate from Local Dines and made the mistake of not looking at the hours.  We went to have dinner and they do not serve dinner, but close at 3pm.
Just wanted everyone to be aware of this.  We were disappointed but it was our mistake."}
{"text":"Absolutely great place and the service is spectacular. Tiffany T is the best!!!! She takes pride in what she does and it shows!!! You won't find a better person than this young lady. She makes the visit to the BrittleBrush an awesome. Unbelievable service and beyond personable!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Scottsdale this afternoon and needed food.  This place was located in the resort where I'm staying and had good reviews, so we decided to have lunch here.  First thing we encountered was a surly hostess.  She was making such a big deal out of whether the party in front of us was for 2 or 4.  In a place full of empty 4 tops, this hardly seems like a big deal.  Then we waited 30 minutes for our party of 4 to be seated.... again, LOTS of empty tables.  They were having some kind of event, but unless the event was a complete surprise to everyone, you plan your staffing accordingly.

The lunch was good.  I had the turkey sandwich and I enjoyed it.  It was served with a sweet pickle, which I don't like, but others at the table liked them.  My onion rings were perfectly done and delicious and came with a nice creamy sauce in addition to ketchup.

Someone else in our party had the fish tacos and said they were worth the wait!

The waitress told us they were having free bread pudding today and brought us all one.  It was delicious!  I loved that it was small for 2 reasons; it was just the right size without being too much; and because it was small, it had a nice crispy exterior.  I loved it!

I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Tasty little spot after a round of golf. 
Nice view of the range & the mountains inter distance. friendly server, prompt seating and fairly speedy food service. 
Indoor/ outdoor seating. Unfortunately they had county music playing for ambiance. Not a fan. 
Ordered the philly sliders and the Caesar salad with chicken. 
Sliders had fantastic flavor. It would have been the bomb if there were mushrooms in the pepper & onion sauté mix. Other than that, they were a tad on the oily side, so eating them while there warm is key. 
Caesar salad came in huge leafs of romaine. The presentation was lovely, very top notch. I don't think I'm that picky about salads, but there's one thing I don't like. 
Having to cut my lettuce to get it in my mouth. Boo. No thanks. I don't want to have to work to eat my meal. 
So after I chopped my lettuce up with a butter knife - no steak or sharp knife provided, I ate my salad. Which tasted like a Caesar. Chicken was yummy. Pesto pepper mix. Pretty small breast provided . 
Oh, and they have complimentary dessert. Sticky toffee pudding. Heath bar crumbles, caramel sauce and marscapone on top. 
Nom nom nom 

Great spot. A lot of things going for them. 
I look forward to trying more delicious items off their menu"}
{"text":"They DEFFINATELY knew what to get from the bar and from the food menu.
Will go there again for sure, and ask \" What's good\"
Great view!!"}
{"text":"I liked this place enough to lunch here twice during my stay at the Westin Kierland.

As expected, the prices are resort appropriate but the food is well executed.

The whiskey onion soup, onion rings and waffle fry nachos are delicious. I had a grilled shrimp salad which was ok but you don't really come here for salad. 

The BEST part of the meal is the complimentary Sticky Toffee bread pudding. Yum...."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my wifey during a conference. Great view to the golf course and the mountains. We had French onion soup and a salad. Both were good. Better than the food was the service. Nice staff. I'd visit again if staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"Service has gotten bad.  Prices and menu are a problem. Management is very displaced. Waste of a nice location"}
{"text":"Have you tried the new Brittlebush brunch menu? We sampled the delights on a beautiful warm November Saturday on the patio with gorgeous views of the golf course and mountains beyond. The food was simply outstanding.
    I had the scrambled eggs with smoked trout which arrived with the eggs delicately cooked on top of delicious soda bread. The scones are warm, flaky and melt in your mouth with butter and the strawberry compote. My favorite was the French toast made from corn bread drizzled with Nutella, and caramelized banana. 
   Another highlight was the coffee by Press, roasted in Arizona. In fact, I went immediately to Press Coffee Shop at Scottsdale Quarter to buy some coffee for home!!    
   Wow, this is a golf course restaurant that doesn't have just burgers and fries or fish and chips. Run, don't walk to try this delicious brunch menu."}
{"text":"The service here is top notch, I have no doubt about it as I once (over 10 years ago) worked for the same company at the same property at the Kierland resort, so I have no doubt the Westin takes training seriously. The food was above average but not exceptional. I brought my parents with me to have a New Year's Eve lunch, they enjoyed the location and the drinks and the food as well. Mom Ordered a prickly pear margarita, dad had a black label scotch and I got me some Moscow mule. All drinks were well made. We then ordered the nachos, which our server informed us that its not your regular nachos, however it was like a waffle fries with some of the nachos toppings. It was tasty and different, I wouldn't call it nachos though.  For lunch, mom ordered the Phoenix cheese steak sliders, dad got the Brittlebush burger and I had the pastrami reuben panini . Please note that none of the dishes come with any extras (fries or salad) as they were all a la crate style ordering, so I asked for onion rings, fries and sweet potato fries to come with our meals. Dad LOVED the burger, and said that they were not dry at all (and he likes his burgers well done). Mom was happy with the cheese steak sliders. As for me, my pastrami reuben panini was tasty and filling, I would have loved it more if it came with some au jus sauce. The fries and onion rings were average nothing exciting (fries were not crispy), but the sweet potato fries were great. The views were amazing as it's pry of the golf course and the golf club house. Outdoor seating would have been ideal but was a bit cold and aside from the fireplace they had no outdoor heaters. Good place to hang and have a bite to eat. I'll definitely come here again. Note: open only for lunch."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. We had the Ahi trio first, bland, bland, and bland. The chef seems to be afraid to use salt or come remotely close to properly seasoning dishes. It's unfortunate because the quality of ingredients is there. For entree's we had the Kobe beef sliders, temp was spot on but once again not a hint of salt or seasoning. Best part of that was the buns. Also, had the fish taco's which had a very heavy very sweet orange Asian glaze which is a weird flavor for a southwest grill. Flour tortillas were way to thick, every bite was dominated by sauce and tortilla. The server Guy, did a good job. The best part of the meal by FAR were the three little donut holes. Could have used double that amount but they were fried perfectly and the filing was good. Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying holy crap. Polenta Tots. Yes.

I had no interest in trying the polenta tots because they sounded weird, but I was talked into them and wow. They're amazing. I would come back JUST to have more of those. They're delicious and the chipotle aioli they come with is delicious. Try them. 

Anyway, some other things I tried:

Onion Rings with Harissa Dip- These were alright but not as great as the polenta tots!
Grilled Shrimp Salad- Sooooooo good. The grilled shrimp was cooked perfectly- so juicy.
Chicken Panini- Really tasty and I loved the Truffle Brie Spread. I actually wish there was more of it on the sandwich.
Spicy Steak Tacos- Really yummy! Just be aware that they are small (street tacos).

Their complimentary dessert was also really good. I highly recommend trying this place out for lunch if you're staying at the Westin (or even if you're in the nearby area). It's located near their golf clubhouse area but the food is so great. It should be enjoyed by more than just the folks who are golfing!"}
{"text":"This restaurant  is one of the untapped surprises of the Westin Kierland property!  We call or come by everyday just to find out what the popcorn flavors are. Some of our absolute favorites from Chef Cole Chiaramonte are: jalapeño with Parmesan cheese (and this is big curls of Parmesan), bacon, garlic with a hint of mustard, bacon and cinnamon, and the list goes on and on. This is gourmet popcorn and it's very best!! Goes great with the beer btw. 

I had the most awesome sandwich today: Grilled NY Strip Steak Sand Wedge, Gorgonzola cheese, fried onions, roasted red pepper, horseradish cream, sautéed mushroom, artesian bread. 

The staff is always awesome, great customer service!!

Check the hours, open for lunch and then 3-5 is a happy hour menu."}
{"text":"First, the whole food scare D grade guy. BS. Saw the posting on the door as A. 

Second, great service. Nice server. Management follow up. Complimentary small dessert. 

Third, food is just okay-good. Had the pastrami sandwich, it is good. Not $16 good but an okay sandwich. 

All in all - a safe, solid Westin option."}
{"text":"The servers are really friendly and attentive. The view is great. Ponds, green areas, and the driving range are all in view.  the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in Scottsdale! Carrie our bartender made us feel welcome the moment we sat down! Food was delicious! Great place after golf!"}
{"text":"Wow, first of all I'm surprised at the rave reviews this place has received. A friend and I were looking forward to a day at the spa and were recommended here by the concierge. I ordered a chopped salad, and my friend ordered a beet salad.  I was SHOCKED when my salad came out - it was very small, and although the menu description said avocado, I assumed I would receive a beautifully presented salad with sliced avocado on top. Nope. I literally had to find my avocado, which ended up being 4 diced pieces. I thought I would have slices of red onions. Nope. I really do think they used the condiments section for the hot dog stand, to obtain my red onion. And the salad dressing was around the end of the plate. So I had to circle my salad on the edges of the plate in order to get some dressing?? Ridiculous! 

My girlfriend ordered a beet salad. The word \"beet\" was in the title. She had three small pieces of beet. Really?! it was pretty comical of how bad this place was, and unfortunate this was our start to a day at the spa. Highly DO NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"Spent the weekend at this wonderful Westin. If you are going to spring training...suggest you stay here and enjoy this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Arrived 15 minutes prior to a special early last call and took a seat on the patio planning to have one drink and head out. Sat here for 15 minutes, during which time a waitress walked by me and made eye contact with me before going back inside. No one acknowledged me and I left after sitting there for 20 minutes. 

On top of that I had called earlier in the day to make sure they would be open their usual hours since they often do special events. I was told they had normal hours all week. 

Super good service, guys."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious food and extremely impeccable service. Our trio enjoyed a terrific view of the Westin Kierland Golf Course and the desert beyond on a flawless winter day. Our server could not have been more gracious. The coffee is remarkable and we were warmed up to start. One of us had the burger which was an enormous beef patty cooked to perfection on a huge toasted bun with all the extras. Yum. Another friend had the tacos and they were also amazing - not too spicy, but flavorful. I had the chopped salad with salmon. That salmon was perfectly cooked and made the salad. The sweet potato fries, while a bit soft, were delicious. And that little bit of desert bread pudding put us all over the top. I'd come back for certain, and next time I'm staying the night..."}
