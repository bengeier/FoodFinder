{"text":"We were very lucky and went to this lovely bistro on its second day. 
The escargot was large, tender and perfectly seasoned.
The duck was very tender and flavorful.
The beef tartar and salmon were both perfectly prepared and were very tasty.
We also tried the crème brûlée & the parfait and both were a wonderful finish for our meal."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the experience was phenomenal. They rushed to accommodate our infant with crayons and a high chair and made sure there was a child portion since they didn't have a kids menu. I had an incredible duck meal and my wife said her steak was cooked perfectly. The waiter was always around when needed and very friendly. Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"This place was GREAT. Our waiter was very kind and helpful with recommendations. The onion soup was delicious, and the bread was just to die for. I had the salmon tartare and thoroughly enjoyed it. My dining companions RAVED about the duck confit. Definitely would go back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Great very authentic feeling French bistro. Went here for dinner on a date and had a great time. I would come back again. 

Service: the staff was very kind and contributed to the positive mood. When our dessert was taking some time we were offered coffee which was kind. Otherwise service was timely and good.

Food: we had a salmon tartare and the duck confit. The salmon tartare was definitely the better of the two, and was very well made and tasted fantastic. The duck was as expected, no complaints there but did not impress as much as the salmon in terms of flavors.

Price: pretty reasonable for an average dinner date. With any of the main plates they'll add an appetizer and dessert for $6 extra which I thought was a great deal."}
