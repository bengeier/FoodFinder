{"text":"Food was awful and so was the service. It took over an hour for the food to come out. The tacos and enchilada were gross, stale tortillas and burnt sauce. We sent everything back and just left."}
{"text":"Fabulous tacos. I adore the new veggie and ahi tuna tacos! Quick and helpful service, even better bar staff. Great drink prices are always a plus."}
{"text":"The Tacos are some of the best I have ever had! It is a nice little Gem there in the Music Factory. I love going there before Comedy Shows."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! The food is terrible!! I ordered 2 tacos and my boyfriend ordered 3. One of the tacos was so hot I couldn't finish it and I love spicy food. There was nothing on the menu about the chicken taco being spicy!! The second taco was just bad! I sent both tacos back. My boyfriend's didn't even finish his food it was so bad! The guacamole was a dark shade of brown and the margaritas were over priced and tasted like the premixed ones you get from a bucket at the store. On top of all of that my boyfriend and I got food poisoning that night from the horrible food at this place!  The one nice thing I can say is when I called to complain the next day the manager was very apologetic and refunded our entire bill."}
{"text":"Terrible!!!! Worst Mexican in all of charlotte and the worst mex I've ever had. Went with a large group and everyone sent there did back and half of them ended up sick. The guacamole was brown and the tacos were disgusting. I wouldn't rec this place to anyone. Please do yourself a favor and don't eat here!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Waitress did not care about food allergy. She took our food order and someone else brought us the food that was stone cold. Food lacked any flavor."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I wish we would've read the reviews before we went there. 

First off, we couldn't even tell if the place was open. Then we were semi escorted to a unset table. The menu was confusing and the waiter couldn't explain it. We ordered some waters and they were brought out individually. We didn't wait too long for food which was fine, but my friend ordered a burrito and got a taco. She politely stated that and the waiter blamed the kitchen and Said people don't order burritos usually. Isn't this a Mexican food place?!  He then pondered what to do and took her food away. He stated he would just charge her for a taco and not the burrito($5 cheaper). 

The rest of us had our food and starting nibbling on our food and her burrito came out a few minutes later... with our checks?? We just started eating!!! We didn't didn't even ask for it. Then we looked at the check, and he charged us full price for the burrito. We waited until we were done eating to address this. When we asked him about it he acted confused and said maybe he could do something about it. He came back with a new check for my friend and then asked us if we were ready to cash out. He then stood there while we got our credit cards out to pay. I said \"this is a strange experience\" and he told me I wasn't very nice. I thought I was the paying customer having a terrible experience?!

He came back later with our checks and brought them back individually. He never once asked if we wanted a refill of our drinks and the food was mediocre. We will not be returning. I don't know how this place can stay in business"}
{"text":"$2 Taco Tuesdays. Our party of 9 tried all of the tacos and most of the appetizers, and generally found most food to be acceptable. There were pros and cons to each taco variation, but my feeling is that if we'd paid the full $4 price for each we would have been pretty disappointed. 

Skip the carnitas taco. It's just pulled pork without any flavor. The chicken tinga taco was good but did have some inedible chicken pieces in it. The carne asada flavoring was great, even though the meat was tough (almost expected with carne asada). The winner for several of is was the grilled portobello taco. The mushroom itself had a good flavor, and the combination of portobello, queso fresco, cabbage slaw and the picked vegetables was really nice. 

The guacamole is made in house daily and was good. The chips are too thick and hard for my preference. And what Mexican place charges for chips and salsa?! 

The service was good, even though it was clear they're still working out some kinks. They allowed me to bring in a birthday cake and they provided extra plates and silverware without complaint. 

The ambiance is cool, and overall I found this to be a pleasant addition to the NC Music Factory area."}
{"text":"I can not even express how mad this place made me! I went there sat night April 11. We waited at the hostess stand for Ten minutes never got waited on, so we sat at the bar. The bartender told us to take the table behind us and wait for a server. We waited for another 15 minutes and nothing. We noticed two men who worked there were busy with an angry woman who was having issues with another woman giving her dirty looks... We were passed by three servers no one ever checked on us. So after we noticed a man at the hostess stand finally taking another couple to the table we walked over and I slammed my menu down and walked out. We were so disappointed, we had only heard great things and no one even wanted us to experience this. I will not recommend this to anyone... Disappointed and annoyed!"}
{"text":"I was really excited that Texicali moved into this restaurant space and was looking forward to an excellent dinner before going to the comedy club which shares the space downstairs.  I made a reservation on OpenTable to make sure we got seated in time to eat and go see the show.  We arrived Saturday night, and found it dead inside.  Well, we didn't have any trouble getting our table, that's for sure.

I liked what they had done with the interior of the restaurant, giving it a more modern Mexican/Tex-Mex feel with its \"Day of the Dead\" decor.  

We ordered a couple of expensive Coronas while we sat underneath an air vent and fan that must have been turned up to \"maximum frigidity.\"    We perused the menu and noticed that there wasn't a lot on it, and what there was seemed a bit pricey.   You don't even get free chips & salsa, so we ordered the guacamole to start.   It was decent, but was barely an appetizer.  More like an appeteaser.  
 
For my entree, I ordered the Chicken Tinga burrito.  It came on a plate...with nothing else.  And it was one of the smallest, tightly rolled burritos I've ever seen (think the kid-size version at Moe's, Qdoba, or Chipotle).  The flavor was just ok.  I expected more for the price, its uniqueness, and its size.  I ate it with a fork and knife...and was still a tad hungry.  Since it was our \"date night\" and hadn't already filled up on much, we split the Tres Leche cake for dessert, too.  It, too, was ok, but I've had better, moister, and more flavorful Tres Leche cakes.  

All in all, everything was just \"ok.\"  I can't really say much more than that.  But I can tell anyone to not think of Texicali as any other Mexican or Tex-Mex restaurant where you get a lot of food.  

Would we return?  Without hesitation, no.  While the atmosphere is nice (overlooking the A/C problem), you don't get enough in return for what you pay for.  I'd eat somewhere else outside of the NC Music Factory prior to going to the comedy club again.  

A note to Texicali:  look at your customer base.  You are based at the NC Music Factory where the primary customers are 20-somethings who do not have a lot of extra cash and have high metabolisms.  They're not interested in a dainty, expensive meal.  They want a lot of food and cheap drink specials.   You could have been something great, but you blew it by trying to appeal to an upscale clientele that you're just not going to get."}
{"text":"On Halloween (10-31-14) the servers/employees tried to start a fight with people walking away from the bar for no reason at all. Screaming curse words and taking their shirts off. If this place is ran anything like its employed I highly recommend a new venue. Would not feel safe bringing my children here at all. Not family recommended."}
{"text":"How dare me book a reservation at a restaurant without checking Yelp reviews first! I didn't look at the reviews until the day of and was instantly kicking myself when I saw the low start rating. I went anyway with the hopes I would have a better experience, but I didn't.

Went with a friend for my first stop of restaurant week and I'm in no hurry to go back. They've only got two stars for a reason, that's because of their bland and unimpressive food.

Starter:
We had the queso fundido, it's a basic queso nothing too exciting. If you like your queso on the mild side you'll like there's, it wasn't spicy at all.

First course:
I had the grilled Mexican sweet corn. It was covered in queso, cilantro, chili powder, and a roasted garlic aioli. Would have been very good but it wasn't hot, tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long.

She got the guacamole that wasn't good at all, looks and tastes like it came out of a bag. They're definitely not making it fresh.

Second course:
I had the texas brisket enchiladas while she ordered the surf & turf enchiladas, both were just ok.


Third course:
We both got the Chicken Zarape which is a grilled chicken breast topped with bacon, queso, cotija cheese, pico de gallo, chipotle sauce, crema fresco, and served with cilantro rice, and charro beans. It was good but lacking Mexican flavor.
*It tasted like something TGIFriday's would serve.

The overall dinning experience was lacking. Don't think I'll go back, there are too many great Mexican restaurant in Charlotte to eat this mediocre food."}
{"text":"This one is simple. We had an 8pm reservation, we arrived an hour early, checked in and had a drink at the bar. Even though they knew we were there, our table wasn't ready at 8pm.  We waited until 8:20 when they told us we were \"better off\" ordering at the outside bar. We tried, but they had stopped serving food. At this time our reservation was cancelled and we NEVER GOT SAT. Showed up an hour early for a reservation and NEVER GOT SAT. The Manager (assuming there is one) never came out, never apologized, never offered a drink or a free app, never did a thing. Needless to say, don't go there. I'm a Charlotte native and this city has much more to offer than this so don't subject yourself. They will be out of business soon; much sooner than we would've got sat for dinner."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Mean employees and over priced food. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you are about to die of starvation...even then you will likely be worse off. I would chose no stars if it was an option. The food is inedible."}
{"text":"Perhaps the flavor could be more intense, but based on my recent experience here, I believe some of the previous reviews are a little harsh maybe.  Service admittedly was a tad bit slow, but our server was both friendly and helpful.  The location is great and the valet parking just outside the door is convenient.  The space is nice and open and they can easily cater to large parties.  The guacamole was more than decent with a nice hit of lime and cilantro flavor.  The southwest chicken bowl could have used a bit more of both, but was overall quite tasty.  The serving sizes are more than adequate and the Tres Leches cake for dessert was incredibly light and moist.  Overall, I would definitely not hesitate to venture out here a second time."}
{"text":"I checked out Texicali during restaurant week. Honestly, it was a last resort option - a friend wanted to go somewhere for Queen's Feast and Texicali had availability. It did not seem like a great deal, in terms of Queen's Feast, but they offered a good bit of food, and also had their regular menu available, so we decided to check it out. The food was okay - nothing mind blowing but it was tasty. We had items that (supposedly) were being offered only during restaurant week, with the exception of the guacamole (pretty bland) and the queso fundido (really good). Satisfying is the word I would use to describe the food experience - I got my fill, and it wasn't horrible, but I could have taken or left it. The drinks were good - both in terms of quality and price. But what really sold me, and the reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 3,  was the service. Our waiter, and the guys who ran our food to us, were very friend, and funny; they really made it a great experience. Overall, I think this would be a great place to go if you are with a large group, and you want to have a good time with decent food and good drinks. The atmosphere, and food seemed perfectly suited for that sort of thing."}
{"text":"As an Elite Yelper, I'm ashamed to say I did not read the reviews prior to scheduling a lunch meeting at Texicali. I chose Texicali because several of my coworkers had never been to the Music Factory and I know that most people in the group like Mexican food. We went on a Friday afternoon and were one of maybe 4 tables dinining in the restaurant. 

The salsa and the food were absolutely delicious, I wish their service was as good as their food. It took over 15 minutes for our drinks to come out, then took an additional 45 minutes for our food to come out (we ordered our food shortly after being seated). We got our food but had no silverware, that took an additional ~5 minutes. Then, we had to wait, and wait, and wait for our checks. All told, the lunch ended up taking nearly two hours -thankfully I was with all of my supervisors... but Texicali needs to step up their service. I'll miss their delicious tacos and tasy guacamole, but won't be returning until their reviews improve."}
{"text":"Mango Margarita was on point!!!

Funny because I felt like I got a little more star treatment than my friends. Got the garnishments for my drink... they didn't. Got my food first... they didn't. Got to take the dipping dishes home... they didn't. 

The Yucca fries are good with the homemade ketchup (which I thought was salsa) and some sauce. 

My tacos were decent. I tried some of my friends rice and beans which was pretty good. 

I'll definitely go back and try another set of tacos or perhaps a burrito. 

Definitely getting again:

chips/salsa
yucca fries
mango margarita"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. The decor is awesome but everything else was awful. Went in with 4 people on a Saturday night. Asked the hostess for a table - She looked at us like we were crazy.. She pointed to the room and said \"we are pretty busy, but I'll go look for a table.\" When she came back, she said a table might be ready in 30 minutes. We stepped to the bar and that was an even worse experience. The bartenders were rude, didn't know the menu, and took forever to acknowledge us. The margaritas tasted like Jose Cuervo sweet and sour mix and were over priced. The bartender over charged me for the tequila and when I asked him about it he aid \"We are still working out the kinks\" Well.. sir.. you got more than kinks to work out for sure... no adjustment was made for the overcharge. 

We waited an hour to get seated and when we asked the hostess she told us no one is leaving and walked away. So we walked out. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Really hip place in a hip location (NC Music Factory), this restaurant doubled as our Salsa Dance Floor during the night I went. So they knew they'd be getting a large group, yet, like others have stated on Yelp, they seemed unprepared (i.e., understaffed) for what was to come! My friends and I had to fight for a drink....not necessarily the bartenders fault but there just wasn't enough staff to accomodate the large crowd. Took forever to get a drink. Food came out relatively quickly though.....

Speaking of food. Overall it was pretty good! The salsa was fresh, chunky and spicy the way I like it. Got the pork & BBQ sliders dish with 2 tacos. we got the brisket and carne asada tacos.....all were VERY good! A friend got the chip plate and their queso dip was excellent. I was SO hoping that the bacon guacamole that I ordered would be great....well, it was just A-OK. It had bacon, ancho chiles, fresh guac, cilantro, onions, etc....everything that should make this a stellar dish....but the flavors just didn't integrate well....at least the way THEY did it. Pretty hot dish, which I really liked, but it was missing something and not well balanced. So I just went back to the regular guac on the table and life was good.

So I'd say 4 stars for food and 2 stars for service...split the difference for a 3 star experience. They could easily overcome the service issue with having more staff available for specialized events or when popular concerts are being held around the corner."}
{"text":"Went for $2 Tacos on a Tuesday...the place was empty.

The tacos were good, but not worth more than $2, full price would have been way too much.  And yet, we were charged full price.  I called to ask to have this checked out - and instead of looking into the incorrect charge, the manager just promised me free tacos in the future....thanks?

Salsa is super watery - like can't even get on a chip watery.

Margaritas are way overpriced and my friend's was incorrect.  

I would only come back for $2 tacos and literally get nothing else.  Nothing.  And hope that the price is correct.

Better places out there for sure..."}
{"text":"Wow, I must say I was really impressed with their food.  The menu didn't seem very spectacular (not a ton of choices) but I thought everything was really yummy.  Starting with the salsa which was delicious!  For dinner my husband and i just ordered a few steak tacos and the chicken nachos.  Full of flavor.  I will totally be back again! 

The service was a little slow, but it was right before a bunch of events at NC Music Factory, so that was to be expected."}
{"text":"Understaffed and overpriced!!!! Highly disappointed, I visited once before and figured I would give it another try, big mistake."}
{"text":"Texicali was a major disappointment.

Tried this place out for restaurant week and suffice it say, I will not be rushing back. Before trying out a new place, I like to browse the yelp reviews (I mean, DUH), the online menu(s), twitter/instagram pages. I looked up Texicali the night before I went and it was a big RED FLAG to me that Texicali's instagram hardly shows any of their food. The low rating on Yelp was another flag. Texicali refers to themselves as a \"Taco and Tequila bar\" yet for their restaurant week menu, NOT ONE TACO is listed as a meal option. I always figure that the point of the restaurant week is to introduce new patrons to the best of what's offered.

So on to my restaurant week experience...My friend and I started off with the queso fundido - it tasted like basic cheese dip, nothing special of note about it all. For my first course, I ordered the guacamole. I always judge a place by its guac and with Texicali's guac? I'm banging my gavel in disgust. The guacamole tasted like a pre-made mix with some jarred pico de gallo put on top. For shaaaame. The guac was served with fried rings of flour, not chips, which also added to its overall wrongness. Second course, I got the surf & turf (carne asada and shrimp) enchiladas. These actually weren't that bad. Third course, I ordered the chicken zarape. This wasn't that bad either. However, it tasted nothing reminiscent of a Mexican dish but more like something you would find at a Chilli's. Dessert was a tres leches cake with smores. Was not a fan of the cake. Traditional tres leches cake has nothing to do with smores - the cake tasted as confusing as the description.

The best part of the meal was the margarita I ordered. It was perfectly mixed and smooth.

Texicali seems confused as to what direction they want to take the place. Our waiter told us that some of things offered on their restaurant week menu are potential meals that will be added to their regular menu. Personally, I feel Texicali should focus on being a spot to get a good drink (because they clearly know how to make a good margarita) and should lean toward a more 'street food' feel. Make their menus taco-heavy and really get a good grasp on making that their thing and making them good."}
{"text":"First let me say, I was excited to try TexiCali for dinner before a big night of Rick Springfield, Loverboy and Romantics! This was only our second experience at NC Music Factory, and not enjoying our previous meal at another restaurant there, we thought we would try TexiCali since we love Mexican! 

We knew it would be busy there with a big concert scheduled. When we arrived, they asked if we had reservations. I did not know that they took reservations, so good to know although I will NEVER BE RETURNING! We were able to find 3 spots at the bar. It was obvious that the restaurant was severely understaffed, but especially the bar area! There was only one bartender on our side of the bar which was the very long side. 

When we finally got his attention, we ordered drinks and food so we wouldn't have to wait. They were out of pint glasses so my husband's beer came in 2 plastic cups. I had to ask twice for water. We ordered guacamole which never arrived. But a runner brought chips and salsa. Although the bartender said it was coming! We never got utensils, only napkins & little plates.

In the meantime the same runner came to our bartender/server to tell him that they were out of mahi, one of the tacos I ordered. I overheard the conversation and he looked at me periodically throughout the conversation, so he knew I heard what they were discussing. Rather than tell me that they were out of mahi to allow me to order another taco, he told the runner that it was not his responsibility! Seriously, that is what I heard him say! Then after more waiting, another bartender was in our Area and my friend asked if she would check on our food because a table of six behind us that was seated after us had already received their food. The bartender replied bartenders and servers don't work the same and food comes out differently because of that. My friend said \"I don't really want to hear excuses, I would just like you to check on our food\". Shockingly the female bartender looks right at us and says \"no but you are more than welcome to go back there and check on it!\" I am not kidding! Our mouths dropped to the floor! At that point, we should have asked for the manager!

Our food eventually came out and we told the runner that we never got our guacamole. She said she would go get it. I said no just forget it and I mentioned that there was no mahi taco on my plate. She explained that they were out of mahi. I told her that yes I knew that as I overheard her entire discussion with our bartender, yet he never bothered to tell me so I could order something else. 

Our bartender/server came over to apologize for the rudeness of the female bartender that told us to check on our own food! He said she was a BITCH and that it was her last day! When I mentioned that I never received the guacamole or my mahi taco, he said \"oh yeah we're out of mahi\". I told him that yes I knew that as I overheard his discussion. He never responded beyond that.

We should have asked for a manager, but quite honestly he or she is to blame because the restaurant was understaffed and they obviously hire RUDE wait staff with attitudes! 

Note to manager: the restaurants in NC Music Factory are going to be busy on a night of an event! Otherwise, with no concert or event, I don't see why anybody would go eat there! Therefore, you should staff your restaurant appropriately to be able to fulfill the needs of your customers! And more importantly, do not hire rude wait staff with attitude! They have no business being in customer service whatsoever! On an irrelevant side note, the food was pretty good, although cold, but we didn't care about the food at that point! The RUDE & uncaring attitude of the entire restaurant superseded any quality of food! Again we will NEVER go there again, and I suggest you don't either!"}
{"text":"So we have been here waiting to be seated since 8:45. We take a seat at the bar and ask for a menu and the server says kitten is closed. Considering we are still on the wait list for a seat. I think that this is poor management. Unfortunately the band was amazing and should receive 5 stars. For it being cinco de mayo they should have planned better for the amount of business that they had, and lost tonight. So many patrons are disappointed that they couldn't be sat. Empty tables for a hour and they tell us the kitchen is backed up 90 minutes. We are now leaving to go get food somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was here opening night and the food was very mediocre and service was slow. I decided to give it another shot last week and was extremely disappointed. The service was so slow that we walked out. This included the bar area. They are clearly understaffed. It's unfortunate as the place is in a prime location and could do really well- if they wanted to. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday before a comedy show and it happened to be $2 taco night. The tacos were good and salsa was too. The only thing that lacked was the service. Our group along with maybe two more were the only people in the restaurant. The staff seemed frazzled at times, like they couldn't keep up and the food took at least an hour to get out to us. Will probably go back, but it won't be when I need to get some where in a hurry."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. Soooooo bad. It's been a long time since I've not been able to think of a single food-related reason to return to a restaurant, but that time is now. Even $4 margaritas can't save the food here.

I tried the 3 salsa app, which at $7, was a little steep for some chips & dip. The green salsa tasted like lime juice and chilies, the red salsa tasted like tomato paste and chilies, and the... bbq sauce (?) tasted like someone had tried to fancy up some cheap, sugary bbq sauce with some OJ and you guessed it, more chilies. It was syrupy and definitely the grossest thing on the platter. 

Imagine my disappointment when my \"shredded brisket and cheese enchilada\" came chalk-full of the same nasty bbq sauce, minus the OJ. And for $9, I got two little 5\"x1.5\" sticks with no sides. 

I tried my friend's guac ($7) - straight from a food service company freezer bag. I tried my friend's queso (also $7) - straight from another food servicecompany bag with a little chorizo mixed in. Fortunately, the plastic cheese was the first halfway edible thing I'd had and I ate it because I was starving.  

Even with the terrible food, the weirdest thing was the decor. I couldn't figure out how snakeskin booths, angel wings, Day of the Dead, motorcycles, birdcages, and iron crosses went together. That is, until my friend pointed out that it looked like an Ed Hardy store threw up in there... its decor style is \"dudebro.\" 

In closing, my Yelp tip says it all, \"Come for the drinks, get wasted or leave before you get hungry.\""}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty, but the hostess told us it would be about a 20 minute wait, so we decided to sit at the bar instead. It took at least 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge that we were there and another 15 minutes for drinks. I flagged the bartender down and asked for dinner menus, which he should've already voluntarily given us. He acted frustrated that I asked and told me I would have to hang on because he was really busy. After another 25 minutes of waiting for a menu, we paid for our drinks and left. We were sitting right in front of the beer taps where they saw us every single time they went to pour a beer. It wasn't like we were off on a distant corner of the bar. I'm a very patient person, but that was all I could handle that night. I will never be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"**Beer and fun review only**
Men's room over by OSSO 8:57 PM, exited at 9:01 PM - \"Hey, wait a minute, where did everybody go?\" Cricket - cricket -tumbleweed. The Yelp party was unplugged.
An impromptu after party started at Texicali - couples dancing and swirling - watch your toes or you might lose them. Very loud. \"What's that?\" I said, \"it's very loud in here\". Good beer selection. Fast and frosty. Was too stuffed from party samples to eat anything else (but their \"street corn\" was quite tasty). Maybe I can make it back and try something off the menu."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Easy to get to and fast service. Food was very very good, taco's are slamming."}
{"text":"Yelpers take heart: Texicali has heard our cry, and now serves free salsa and chips with every order.

That said, the food is good. Not rock your socks off good, but good as an alternative to Matties for a daytime lunch when I want to sneak in a drink. Speaking of drinks, the bar is where this place really shines. I'm unfamiliar with fully half of the liquor brands they stock, but each time I've been surprised (pleasantly) by the balance and flavor of the libations, particularly the tequila-based drinks. Friendly service, too."}
{"text":"I've got two words for you:
BRISKET TACOS!! Oh sweet Jesus, they were just delicious! And the beans!!! JUST bomb.com!

Our first bartender was SO NICE!!! We got there right after they opened I think, so it was pretty slow so we had the bartender's full attention, I never had an empty glass in front of me, he kept our drinks flowing! Hung out for hours just chilling at the bar and they had no problem at all. Even after our first bartender was done with his shift he stayed around hanging with his coworkers and still refilled my sodas when he was just hanging out! INCREDIBLE!!! I would try this place again!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Texicali and I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE....Sweet Taco Jesus! I ordered the Bacon Guacamole Dip, the flavor was amazing!!!! Even though I picked a few dark peppers out (just to be safe) for my entree I ordered 4 Tacos all on flour tortillas...I would highly recommend ordering the Carne Asada and Smoked brisket, Best tacos ever! Also the ambiance here is too cool for school! There's a motorcycle displayed in the center of the bar which adds a funky edge. All the staff members are really nice and quick on their feet my food was out within minutes...I cannot wait to go back! Thanks to everyone here tonight"}
{"text":"Went to Texicali yesterday for dinner before the Eddie Griffin comedy show in the Comedy Zone. There's a direct entrance from the restaurant to the Comedy Club so it's a great spot to get dinner before the show and hang out for drinks after.

We ordered the Yucca Fries as an appetizer. I love fried yuca so I was very skeptical of how good these would be. To my surprise, they were delicious. The right amount of crisp on the outside but very soft on the inside, exactly how they should be.

For the main courses, wife ordered the Enchilada/Quesadilla combo and I had the Chicken Zarape. The chicken was delicious and the bites I had of my wife's meal was very good as well. My wife ended up eating most of my cilantro rice and kept remarking on how much she was enjoying it. She ordered the Texicali Margarita and I ordered a Blue Moon. Suprisingly, there's no Blue Moon, but the waitress recommended a \"Day of the Dead\" Hefeweizen, which is a comparable wheat beer. I was surprised at the level of detail where even the brand of the beers match up with the \"Day of the Dead\" motif throughout the place. 

There's definitely been a lot of thought put into the decor and ambiance of this place, from the skeleton greeting you up front, to the flaming Harley in the bar, to the skull designs seemingly implanted into the walls. It's a very cool southwest theme and made me feel like I was in a Robert Rodriguez movie. An added bonus was a great house band playing blues music throughout the night.

The best part, the waitress was conscious enough to know that we had to finish and pay before the start of the comedy show downstairs. It was timed perfectly and we made it to our seats in the Comedy Zone just a couple of minutes before the show started. During the comedy show, we noticed that the menu downstairs is a limited version of what's being served upstairs. We ordered a brownie and tres leches dessert and both were delicious.

Overall, the mix of good southwestern food, good drinks and then good comedy made for a great night!"}
{"text":"Menu is sparse. Would not call this place real texicali restaurant. Who doesn't have fajitas? I mean, really!? Go to Cabo Fish Taco if you want a real taco or other texicali food. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"We were meeting friends in the music factory this weekend and we wanted to try somewhere new. We read the reviews on Yelp and noting the theme of slow service we went early armed with an OpenTable reservation.

Our visit started out very well with our reservation being promptly honoured and finding out that on Saturday night all their draft beers were $4. Including local favorites such as Noda Jamsession and Birdsong Higher Ground IPA we were impressed. 

We decided on the second combo platter option - two tacos, a quesadilla and an enchilada. We chose carne asada for both tacos and when I started to ask if we got an option for the quesadilla and enchilada our waited abruptly cut me off to inform me we only got one of each, which wasn't where I was going but we figured it mean they would be simple bean and cheese. I did not realize until looking back at the menu to write this review that Texicali only has on enchilada option and one quesadilla option on their entire menu. The menu states their enchilada was brisket (I could have sworn it was pulled pork) and the lonely quesadilla option is chicken and spinach. 

The food came out hot and fresh from the kitchen in about 15 minutes which was about the time it took us to finish our chips and salsa (which were just ok - they definitely aren't into giving out full baskets of chips like most Mexican places and gave out a small plate with a handful of chips). The carne asada tacos were actually pretty good but had liquid spilling out profusely. They would have been soggy if they were not eaten immediately. Unfortunately this liquid drained on to our plate and made the quesadillas very soggy. I did manage one corner that was not soggy and that part was pretty good. The enchilada was completely underwhelming. 

With a storm clearly brewing outside we were in a hurry to get our check and relocate but at this point our server was nowhere to be found and almost 20 minutes later I had to aggressively flag him down to get the check.

All said it wasn't a terrible experience but with better options nearby we probably will not return for food though we might hit up the drink special if this place is still open next time we go to the music factory."}
{"text":"What everyone else said. They forgot to assign us a server, so we waited awhile before being greeted. The food was less than mediocre. All staff was very friendly, but they aren't the ones making the blah food."}
{"text":"Last night was my 2nd visit... and this time we only went to the bar. My friends and I went after the Yelp event, Yelp Gets Freaky at the Factory. They had salsa dancing and live salsa music, and that mixed with the crowd from the event, there was a pretty nice party going on. It wasn't too loud, we found a place to sit, the atmosphere was fun... the only complaint I had was that my mojito was terrible. My first visit I tried one and it was the same, and I gave them another shot, and yuck. My husband's mixed drink was the same... watered down and not mixed well. We'll be sticking to beer on our next visit, but we'll def be back with our dancing shoes next time!"}
{"text":"Technically, the wife became a fan. And therefore, I am a fan. It was our first time visiting this place after Yelp's awesome Halloween party. Everyone were on their feet dancing! And though I usually don't until I'm tipsy, Maya grabbed me and we started dancing salsa. I don't even know if that's how you say it. Dance salsa?

Anyway, it was mui fun. (Is that right?) The crowd was feeling it. And I ended up promising that we will return with a set of buddies so we're looking forward to it."}
{"text":"6-24-2014 walked in and found an open table..promptly told it was reserved with 8 tables open! Well he did not offer us anything open and did not welcome us! This is the South! We are welcoming not Pissy Alex! He said he was the owner.. Not southern, Not Texan and Not Nice! We went to Wet Willies and they have a patio to hear the concert!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awful for multiple reasons:
1. Food - bland, under cooked, unoriginal. I ordered yucca fried which tasted like freezer burn. They were mushy and undercooked. The tacos were lackluster too. Chicken tinga was dry and portobello mushroom was slimy and not seasoned at all. Totally gross. Not worth any money. This place should honestly shut down based on food alone.

2. Service - how long does it take to bring out water? 15 minutes apparently. It's slow, which is incredibly surprising given how empty the place is. The waitress didn't even ask me if I wanted a second drink. I would've said no bc my first was gross.

This place is worse than a college dining hall. Food is gross, service is slow, I'm never coming back and openly hating on this place via yelp."}
{"text":"Went with a large group of 15+ people. The first problem was they only gave us 1 waiter, so everything took forever. The waiter never came back to refill my water or offer me another beer. Our first order of tacos came out cold, when they replaced them, they were the wrong ones.  Keep in mind the restaurant wasn't busy during this. The food was just ok and all I could taste is spice from the hot sauce. I feel bad for the waiter for the lack of support, training, and management"}
{"text":"Well, if you plan on coming here, expect horrible service.

I had called in to place an order since it was Taco Tuesday.  How can you say no to $2 tacos!  When I placed the order, it seemed like the person in charge of to go orders understood my order, only to find out once I got there that she missed one of them.  When I informed her, Katie or Casey (didn't quite catch the name), she seemed to give a bit of an attitude as if she was not responsible for the mistake.  No apologies about it.  My friends and I had to wait a little bit longer for the one order that wasn't placed.  Okay, that's fine.  We want our food.  Once the last order came out, she had just passed us the order in the bag \"here's your order.\"  No \"I'm sorry about that.\"  No \"Is there anything else I can get for you?\"  No \"Have a nice day.\"  Real smooth customer service there Texicali.

I'm sorry, but this was the second time that I've had really bad service, and it was only take out!  Note, that it wasn't even busy in the restaurant during lunch time, so I don't understand what was up with the attitude.  The first time I went in for a to go order, there was only a group of five of us and everyone received their bill except me.  Being the good person that I am, I informed the girl (first time was a different girl) that she did not give me my total and she didn't run my card.  She kinda gave me an attitude with it.  Well, excuse me for trying to be good and pay for my order.  

For this place, the food is only alright.  The first time that I came in, the Crispy Chicken tacos were good.  The second time, it was soggy and tasteless.  The food item that I thought was really good?  The free chips and salsa.  Both times I never had any issues with that.

I work just within a five minute walk of this place and am very disappointed with it.  It was the horrible service that makes me just not want to go back.  My coworker even agreed that it was the most horrible service he's seen in a restaurant.  They definitely lost a Tuesday regular due to that.  Guess I'll just have to pack my lunch or drive out of the Music Factory for food during my work hours now."}
