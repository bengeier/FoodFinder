{"text":"The place is always packed on Saturday and Sunday morning. You get seated rather quickly though. Service is prompt. All the breakfast food we've tried has been delicious. My only complaint is they only except cash. I do understandbeing a small business the fees associated with credit cards."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. Never had a bad meal! Plus everyone that works there is super friendly. It's been packed every time I've gone, but the servers are always on the ball. Bring your cash and stop on by! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Streetsboro is the halfway meeting point for me and my family. While visiting for Thanksgiving, I decided to check Yelp for a place where we could go to eat breakfast. I stumbled upon this little gem and we were all quite pleased! We enjoyed it so much that we went back the next day. The omelettes and pancakes are fluffy, The eggs were perfectly cooked and the service was great! You may have to wait a minute to get in this place but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Breakfast and lunch diner style. Clean and bright dinning area with a open kitchen view. The food comes out fast.great sausage gravy n biscuits ."}
{"text":"FAVORITE place in Streetsboro! Whether you're in the mood for breakfast or lunch...this is THE place. They have the BEST burgers in town (just make sure you get the pretzel bun)!! Prices are amazing too. Go now!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun little gem! Waitstaff was awesome with our kids. Our server was energetic and friendly. Food was served hot and plentiful. Large menu with lots of options. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast restaurants. Definitely 'no frills,' but the food is good and the service is great. I love breakfast food and eat here often. Would recommend the 'Herb' or 'Ultimate Herb.'"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff ate here many times haven't had a bad meal yet. Biscuits and gravy are the best in the area. Forget dinner they close at 2pm which is great because id eat there every meal if i could"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and we always leave in a happy mood.  Each time we've visited the place it's been packed with customers, but the wait for a table was not that long.  Food comes out quickly after you place your order.  There aren't many places that offer corned beef hash as a breakfast item so that is what I ordered.  Wife tried the Herb Nelson which was very tasty - she said she'd order that again.  Kids had the home fries, sausage links, and eggs.  We all shared a delicious waffle.  When we have guests visiting from out of town we will take them to Jim's."}
{"text":"We tried what people recommended on yelp.  Biscuit w gravy, waffle w toppings and the ultimate herb nelson. Everything was good. Strawberry and blueberry toppings on the waffle were not fresh fruit but were made into jamlike syrup. I liked it. The ultimate herb nelson was similar to potato skillet with various veggies and meat stirred together. My favorite was biscuits w gravy. Yummy!!! The owner is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from Rhode Island and breakfast was amazing. Great food, great service, friendly and clean. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place!  Never had a bad meal, good prices, friendly staff and delicious food.  The waffles are a must have with crispy hash browns."}
{"text":"Great hearty breakfast food and a friendly staff. Just remember to bring cash as they do not take credit cards."}
{"text":"Food was ok, busy place and the waitresses are rude and abrupt . Be ready for the bums rush. They are not friendly or accommodating ."}
{"text":"We moved near Jim's Too a couple months ago and at first, didn't ever go by when they were open. But then we realized it was breakfast and lunch, and decided to actually leave the house a bit earlier on the weekends to grab some take out on our house hunting adventures.   The first weekend, we ordered as we left the house and when we arrived there, the place was packed! A car was pulling out so we pulled into his spot. He actually stopped me and said, \"Hey! It's really really busy in there!\"  I assured him we got take out and he winked at me.  The gentleman who waited on me as I dodged and ducked to get in the door was extremely nice and got me in and out quickly. That trip we had bacon, egg and cheese bagels. They were really very good! The bacon was crisp and delicious, the eggs were flavorful and fresh, and the bagels? For Ohio, pretty darn good! And after living in NJ all those years, I know what good bagels taste like. It didn't have the snap of the crust like a great bagel does, but there was a good mouth feel to it and wonderful chew.  The second time, we got a bacon cheese burger and another bacon, egg and cheese bagel. My only issue the second time was that when I first walked in, the place wasn't quite as busy as the first time, with about 5 tables empty, and all the waitresses were huddled around one table looking at pictures, possibly. They all looked at me standing by the register but not one person moved until the guy in the kitchen threw his arms up in my direction. The food, however, was again very fresh and we were impressed for a second time.   We'd go in to eat if you could get in the door on the weekends. They seem to empty out a bit around lunch time, but we've gone by at breakfast and they are packed! If you can't go in, do take out. The prices are great and the food is very good for what you pay!  Just remember - take cash!!! They don't accept cards."}
{"text":"The food is always very good.  To the management of Jim's - please sit at your counter and watch your cooks at work cooking but NOT wearing any gloves.  I am surprised this is allowed to happen and would appreciate it being corrected.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Lived in Streetsboro for 15 years and finally gave Jim's a shot. Good food all around and will definitely be back. I am anxious to try the waffles."}
{"text":"The absolute best breakfast place- here or the one in Solon. Small and full of lively people that are exceptional servers.  So good and we always get the following : Big Jim Burgers Belgian waffles- blueberry is the best  Biscuits and sausage gravy - so good and can eat that with a spoon if needed - so delicious  Chicken salad - Beyond good   The ranch and the thousand island dressing is amazing and homemade. The fries and home fries are also amazing. Overall, I can't even express how good it is and soooo reasonable. For five of us we spent 46 and left happy.  They are always busy and there may be a wait, but it's also worth it ."}
{"text":"Was excited to go here for the first time. Food was ok but the service took forever. Seriously like it was setting records. We were there for close to two hours. We watched other tables get their food before us when they ordered after us. After we were done eating we asked for the check and still waited another 15 mins to get it and then another ten for them to pick it up. We will not be back."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST IN TOWN HANDS DOWN. Cheap too. Bring ya motha, brotha, and uncle too. They are accepting credit cards now!"}
{"text":"Jim's is Streetsboro's version of the local diner everyone hopes to find for breakfast. Simple menu, good food, and reasonably priced: breakfast for two with a tip is usually $20-25.  There are, however, a few things that first-timers should be aware of.  First, the parking lot is an unlined free-for-all.  There are usually lots of big trucks that take up two or more spaces, so park at your own risk in this tiny lot that turns to ice in winter.  Second, the staff is generally friendly, but when the restaurant gets busy, there are a couple of salty waitresses that won't hesitate to rush you through your meal.  We had one tell us \"let's pick it up; I have a line at the door,\" with food still on our plates.  Charming.  Finally, in warmer weather, be prepared for lots of patrons of all ages in sleeveless t-shirts and camo who have been skipping the gym for the home fries for a while (set your expectations).  But again, the food's good as long as you have cash, an old car, and don't linger!"}
{"text":"I hadn't planned to review this place, but I see I'm not the only one with this type of experience. The food is good, the servers are special, but I won't go back. As Sugar K. pointed out, the owner is a jerk. Sorry fella, but being rude as a pig doesn't bring customers back. You need me more than I need you, and there are lots of other places to eat."}
{"text":"For a great greesy spoon hole in the wall.... sure this is the place! Value on your dollar and get a la carte to fill all the needed spots in your belly. I always get the corned beef hash. A local favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect breakfast place! The food is always good and the service is excellent. The streetsboro location is a little bigger...if you're going to Solon on a Saturday morning bring a newspaper and be ready to wait about 10 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Superb home fries, a key item for me. Eggs properly cooked, good coffee. Happy, friendly waitress. Diner atmosphere, customers are regular people, room is probably five times the size of Jim's in Solon. We will return!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast around! In addition to the delicious chicken fried steak the staff is friendly and treats you like family."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service. The burgers were good and so were the onion rings and fries. The rice pudding is good but very different from what we were used to!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast! It's very clean and super fast.  They only accept cash, so be prepared! My coffee is always full and service is prompt. It's usually crazy busy in there so that alone should speak for itself."}
{"text":"Downright RUDE! We were told to leave because my baby cried for less than 2 minutes...in a loud place like this where they scream out the orders to the cook. The owner wouldn't even reply to my complaint about this. My friends and family will never patronize either of his restaurants again...and we ate at the other one regularly! If I want corned beef hash from a CAN I will go to the grocery store!!!"}
{"text":"This is a legit diner from the messy Reuben to the ubiquitous B&W checkerboard floor. Can't wait to return to try the breakfast items. CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Love it! Great local diner--small but totally worth it. Doesn't look like much on the outside, but totally worth your time once you go in! I used to come here in the morning with my dad---great homestyle cooking and some pretty awesome prices. The staff is always friendly, and the food comes out fast and hot! And it's GOOD. I always get the Ultimate Herb Nelson, and there are some nights I dream about that homefries and egg scramble. Awesome atmosphere--feels like your Grandpa's kind of place that you not-so-secretly love. They have an ATM on site, but they only accept cash!"}
{"text":"Wow what a scam this place is running!  appears to be a nice place to go until you get your bill and they notify you they are a cash only business.  They dont have anything posted either,  and the kicker is that the P O S  system has a place to swipe credit cards and they have a ATM inside that charges 2.00 and guess what your bank will hit you again for at least 2.00  so now you 8.99 breakfast just turned into 15.00 the owner is a P O S himself no pun intended."}
{"text":"The only diner I've ever been to that was better than Jim's was a dive in West Virginia where the waitresses smoked and you had to walk around the outside of the building to access the bathrooms.  That was some authentic food, and so is the food at Jim's!  When you walk into this place on a weekend, you see a clean diner that's busy as hell, and tastefully decorated.  The reason its so busy is the food, which is outstanding.  The only pre-made thing that I know of here is the sausage gravy, which simmers lovingly, waiting for someone to order it.  I'm pretty sure everything else is made right after you order it.  The waitresses are friendly, but not in that artificial \"chain restaurant\" way.  Be nice to them, they're nice to you, come back, and they remember your face.    If you want a no-frills diner with great food, and you don't mind a slight wait, Jims is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I checked my reviews and I can't believe I've never given a review for my favorite breakfast joint in the area. If you're looking for a classic diner breakfast, this is your place in the Aurora, Hudson, Streetsboro area. I don't eat pancakes or waffles, but I'm told they're very good here. The place is clean, fast, and reasonably priced. If you're looking for a mimosa, or Bloody Mary with your meal, this is not your place. No alcohol served. The location is easy to find right off SR 14 in Streetsboro."}
{"text":"Love it! Prefect diner style breakfast. Friendly staff and quick home style breakfast food!!"}
{"text":"Just tried it for breakfast for the first time.   Fast, friendly and attentive servers, good food at reasonable price.   Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Been driving by this location since we moved out to Streetsboro (1.5 yrs ago) and finally stopped in this AM for breakfast and BOY have we bee missing out on great food and wonderful atmosphere at a great price for those 1.5 years. Today they mentioned that they just got a jukebox in yesterday so the staff and restaurant patrons were having fun playing music and the staff was having a great time singing along. Great \"hometown\" feel to it ad we will be sure not to wait another 1.5 yrs to try it again! One side not...it is cash only however they do have an ATM onsite"}
{"text":"OMG. We have lived in the Boro for 2 years and finally decided to go on our not so often days off together. The Herb Nelson is TO DIE FOR.   Can't get enough. Good Lord, please never stop the Deliciousness! I would imagine everything is great but the Nelson is ..... fantabulous."}
{"text":"Fun little local's spot, good food at a good price.  No attempt at atmosphere makes this a classic.  Not a lot of seating can mean a wait for a table, but give them a try and enjoy the original diner feel.  Breakfast is my favorite."}
{"text":"Had a good breakfast here but it was somewhat bland. Great service but the not a place to go on a \"date\" breakfast. Very plain and the seating is not good."}
{"text":"Great place- awesome menu- lots a special quirky menu items....singing cooks and very friendly servers. Always clean, always busy, always good."}
{"text":"Better than you'll get at your typical breakfast place. Sausage gravy and biscuits are pretty good. Eggs and home fries were fantastic.   The #1 is a lot of food. Pancakes are thick and delicious - ask for double syrup, you'll need it."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast, fast friendly service. Cash only but there's an ATM. Check the address on Google maps as yelp's seems to be wrong by about a mile. It's right by BW3. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal, wonderful staff....especially Debbie who remembered my name after being there for my 1st time :) Will come back again for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped here for breakfast after sleeping at the Walmart on a road trip. This is the place to go to get your fix of hometown diner charm! Clean, bright, incredibly friendly staff. The food is old-school diner fare done just right and the coffee is pretty good too."}
{"text":"We use to have a go to breakfast place we really liked. It was the ONLY one for the last couple of years... Now we have two!!   Jim's open kitchen has now been added to our b-fast place destinations!    It's clean and the staff is efficient & friendly.  It's the place where the locals go and non locals like to go.    I have only been here for b-fast, so I can't comment on lunch or dinner (although m sure we'll try it in the future).  But the b-fast food is good!  The coffee is good."}
{"text":"Food was very good.   Prices were average.   Our service was crappy.   They were very busy, but that's no excuse for bad service in my opinion. I feel that there should be enough people working that we can atleast get a refill of coffee when we ask. Actually, I don't think we should have to ask!!!"}
{"text":"Julie, Tucker and I out for breakfast. Great breakfast, nice friendly waitress and great service! What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"All I ever ask for in a breakfast place is crispy, salty bacon and fast service. This place has both. Everything is fast-paced and the staff are friendly. Pancakes were a stack of three in the combo and homemade delicious. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Oh, Jim's. I always laugh when people come here expecting foie gras and champagne. Jim's is a lovable greasy spoon with locally famous spots in Streetsboro & Solon.  When you walk in, it is totally a retro-throw back diner. Checkered floors, bar and booth style seating and jukebox decor is all around. If you're coming to Jim's, get the breakfast. Or the milkshakes. Or why not a milkshake with your breakfast? I've seen people do it. On my last trip, I opted for the biscuits and gravy with eggs. I swear, it came out from the kitchen in 5 minutes. The breakfast menu is simple, but it gets the job done. Again, don't come here looking for foie gras.  My favorite part of Jim's is the service and staff. Its so refreshing to see a staff that likes their workplace, likes working together and likes chatting with customers. When we visited, you could tell the numerous regulars scattered around the diner. Jim's gives a hometown feel that definitely lacks in the area. You can also come in sweatpants and not be judged. Oh, and hit up the ATM before you go -- cash only!"}
{"text":"Was very busy Sunday morning. We managed to get right in, where people who came in afterwards had to wait. Not much to look at, and had the typical diner feel. Could really tell that this was the place locals favored for breakfast. Wife had the eggs benedict, kids had pancakes, I had the herb Nelson. Everyone cleared their plates. I think it is also important to note that they brought the kids food out first. This allowed us to prep their food before ours came. As for seating, it did feel a little cramped for the 5 of us , but workable. Cost wise it came out to be right around the same as breakfast at bob Evans ."}
{"text":"Small like \"hole in the wall\" type place with very good breakfast food! Service is always good! Have been several times and will continue to go!"}
{"text":"After moving out here from cleveland we were looking for a place like this, a no frills diner with good food done right, quick and inexpensive. This place fits the bill. You must bring cash and the place is always packed and they're only open till i think 2pm and closed mondays. Staff is friendly but some of the customers........LOL not so much. I have long hair and tattoos and the customers talk about me, point at me and avoid me like the plague everytime im there (especially if i sit alone at the counter). Its a good place though and my fiance' and i enjoy it."}
{"text":"First time for wife and myself.  Very pleased with food quality service and price.  Breakfast was great.  We will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Love breakfast here with my family.  Food never disappoints and the waitresses are very friendly.  The prices are excellent but it is cash only.  If you forgot cash or never carry cash like we do, there is an ATM to your left when walking in for your convenience.  Weekends can get busy but it's worth the wait for a great meal."}
{"text":"A classic American diner. Super nice waitresses, good food fast at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Love the place. Quant, friendly, fair priced, welcoming place to have a wonderful meal at. We ate there for breakfast and ordered the homemade chili and a breakfast sandwich. Can't go wrong with those two choices.  Reminder: it's cash only but it does have an on-site atm.  Lastly for management: Just an fyi, the address on yelp page for this place is stated incorrectly.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast; quick, well prepared, with hustling wait staff.  Can't ask for much more in a local diner.  Popped in for lunch for the first time and, although I try not to eat much red meat, had a super cheeseburger with grilled onions on a pretzel bun that rocked."}
{"text":"Jim's isn't much to look at from the outside. The gravel parking lot often has several 18-wheelers parked on the side and everyone else just sort of fills in the other space haphazardly. The sign on the building is not flashy and the surrounded buildings are closed and abandoned.   Walk in, however, and you'rd immediately among friends in a classic diner. The inside is super clean even if it is a bit cramped.   The place is always packed the reason is that the food is awesome. All of the typical breakfast fare done exceptionally well. Next time you are in the area, surely worth a visit."}
{"text":"M. Jims offers a local fare to streetboro. I like a scramble and they deliver with the ultimate plate full. Atmosphere is not trendy but neither are the prices. A belly full of morning starter is what you leave with."}
{"text":"We come here every weekend.  We've tried so many \"breakfast\" spots all over Cleveland and this is the best one by far.  Classic diner food, everything we've ever ordered has been good.  Big fan of the omelettes, waffles, pancakes, the list goes on.  Thank goodness we found this spot because a lot of other places haven't compared."}
{"text":"Best. Breakfast. Ever.  Well, that might be a slight exaggeration, but it's pretty damn close. We went to the Solon location when we first moved to Cleveland and loved it; but it's tiny and tough to get a seat in, especially with our (at the time) 10 month old daughter. So, sadly, we didn't go back.  Finally tried the Streetsboro location now that we live in Hudson. GREAT service, quick to table, delicious diner food. It is what Johnny's diner in Hudson SHOULD be. The Ultimate Herb Nelson is amazing, and I love that you can 1/2 the order. Pancakes are fluffy, waffles gigantic, and my mom thinks their omelets are the best she's ever had. And they supply Franks Red Hot. Boom!!! Love love love. Looking forward to trying lunch here. Cash only! Just a heads up."}
