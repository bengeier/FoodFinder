{"text":"We came into the restaurant as a group of twelve after one of us recommended it. When I first walked in, the decor immediately struck me as the very old fashioned Italian restaurant (checkered table cloths, brick oven, wooden bar, etc.) We were quickly seated and served water. The menu is everything you expect from an Italian restaurant (pizzas, calzones, pasta, veal, etc.) Most of us ordered pizzas and pasta, but I ordered the risotto. Prices were reasonable (my three course meal was less than $20). The appetizers came quickly. My green salad was simple. The garlic bread was also pretty good. The main dishes came soon afterwards. My risotto was very delicious with exactly the right texture and flavour. I got a tasty tiramisu for dessert. Service was very friendly. The owner was very friendly (acting like the italian grandmother I never had), joking with us, and making sure that we were all well served. In fact, one of my friends who eats very slowly was teased jokingly by her. The owner gave her a slice of cake on the house. Overall, restaurant recommended and definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I think the other reviews' take on the decor is a bit much.  it's a basic red checkered tablecloth beneath plastic Italian restaurant.  It was clean if tacky, but hardly worth mocking. 

the staff was very pleasant.  Eggplant parm and spaghetti bolognese were decent.  the pizza was so-so with crust that was not as crisp as you'd like from a wood burning brick oven.  

good place for kids."}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizza. Fresh, tasty with a nice chew to the crust. Bump it to five if the place had a major overhaul...run down with years of diy renovations."}
{"text":"Delicious food. They give amazing warm buns to start. We had the gnocchi and the pesto pizza which were both delicious. We know our tomato sauce and this was one of the best we've tasted. Definitely worth a visit. Very friendly service and we had arguably the quickest service at a restaurant we can remember (granted we were earlier than the dinner rush). The decor is a touch dated but if your looking for some delicious food this is an excellent destination."}
{"text":"I've been here about three times for supper and twice for lunch. I always order penne ararrabiata and if my review depended on this alone my rating would be a five. I took my kids here and they are hard to please. They ate their food without complaining. That's worth a five right there. Unfortunately there's a few negative points to mention. First, the location isn't exactly family friendly. One one side there's an alley and on the other side is a strip club. Second, it's been a least twenty years since there's been any updates on the decor. Posters on the wall are torn. Torn wallpaper is repaired with tape. I've heard more upbeat music at funerals. The service is too slow. On a slow night why does it take half an hour for pasta? ( not an exaggeration ). My guess is they were busy preparing orders for delivery. Judging by the coming and going of drivers they do a lot of delivery business. But while they are taking care of orders for Just Eat you'll be Just Waiting. Now to finish the Risotto was ok but the rice way overcooked and there was no cream to be seen. Only red sauce. The Tiramisu wasn't good enough to finish."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals we've ever had in a restaurant.  We were excited to have pizza made on a wood stove and love Italian food.  We should have taken a cue when we saw the people sitting next to us leave after just a bite of their pizza.  First, the rolls that were brought to us smelled stale/recycled.  They weren't freshly made and it was obvious they were reheated because the outer portion of the bread was warm while the inside was room temp.  The mushrooms they use on the pizza appeared to come from a can and the pizza was bland.  My mother and I ordered the seafood pasta.  The red sauce wasn't bad but the seafood, if you want to call it seafood, was lackluster.  There was some white chewy indescribable fish that was probably 80% of the seafood with a few very small shrimp and several mussels.  The only good thing about the restaurant was our sweet waitress who was excited to give the homeless the leftovers."}
{"text":"Hit's the spot: Atmosphere, Service, & Food

Atmosphere:  Santa Lucia has been occupying it's little corner near Stanley and St. Catherine for quite some time - and it certainly shows.  The place is certainly the \"old school\" dinner other more recent restaurant incarnations try to imitate but fail.  In a word \"charming\".  The place however could use a little bit (ok a lot!) of touch up.  From the raggedy wine coloured rug, to the creaky tables and frayed curtains - it is very obvious that St. Lucia is in the business of frequent clientele turnover (good luck finding a table during lunchtime - thanks to the crush of business people at that time)

Service:  The service at Santa Lucia varies depending on the time of arrival.  Evenings (3pm and up) tend to find the restaurant almost desolate - and thus the staff (one / two people) being very attentive.  Being popular with the business crowed due to its menu and close proximity to many of the businesses in the downtown core - it is very difficult to get a seat (or grab anything to go) during lunch time, so the staff is understandably rushed and brief during those times.

Food:  You will find many a Montrealer who swears by Santa Lucia's pizzas, pasta dishes and Italian sausages, however for the prices charged the food's quality is not something to write home about (but worth a Yelp review!).  Pizzas and calzones are cooked in a stone hearth / oven which gives them an added dash of flavour (watch out, sometimes these are made \"more-oily-than-necesarry\") and some pastas are even made from scratch.  Dishes are served hot, and Santa Lucia makes a great carrot cream soup.

Santa Lucia is best for pickup and for when no other places remains open - its quaint charm is slowly fading (along with the paint) however due to lack of up keep.

Note: It is located directly adjacent to the Che Pare strip club and La Boom nightclub.  Just though you should know!

Worth a try when time allows :O)"}
{"text":"Discovered this restaurant on the way back from a hockey game. The pesto pasta was delicious, pasta was cooked al dente. I had a pepperoni pizza and it was cooked perfectly. No complaints about the food or the service. The deco is dated but we would  go back. Great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Musty smell when we walked in but food was very good. Tortellini gigle (sp)suggested by waiter was outstanding. Nice sauce with filling tortellini. Pasta carbonara was very good, chicken Parmesan was good, garlic bread was good and Italian salad and Caesar salad were very good. Reasonable prices close to hotel."}
{"text":"Ok,ok, not fancy, so what...

We went here to some comfort Italian. No it's not al dente, and no there's no olive oil with balsamic vinegar...

The pasta, is cooked, the sauce is full of flavour, even the cream sauce is well salted. There is nothing bland and subtle about this place. And I like it that way.

All pretence is thrown out the window, all you get is a solid meal at good deal. They have a pizza oven so the pizza crust is done well here. 

The tortellinis are a little tough and over cooked. The other pastas even though not al dente work we'll with the sauce. I was surprised at how fast I ate it all up, it was tasty."}
{"text":"Santa Lucia overall was a surprisingly pleasant experience considering when we sat down we were literally the only people in there, no music was playing and the staff were all gathered round the bar at the back of the restaurant hoping the manager would call it a night. The decor is far from a trendy, dimly lit trattoria but there is a certain 'charm' about the place especially after a drink or two. Our waiter was pleasant and chatty, the god father drink was delicious,  good bread and pasta. There were a a couple of unidentifiable items in our seafood appetizer which I would not recommend.

This place would be a good choice for a group of friends wanting affordable and decent Italian before a night out but not a place for a romantic dinner or impressing parents."}
{"text":"If you want solid and honest al dante spaghetti bolognes, come to this place."}
{"text":"We happened to walk by this place while exploring Montreal during our first visit...and the gentlemen outside really encouraged us to check it out. So we returned later for dinner and we were not disappointed! We were blown away by the delicious & authentic flavors. The spaghetti bolognese was hearty, flavorful & authentic...plentiful, very satisfying. The caprese & house salad wonderful, and you have to try the garlic bread, delish! Yes the decor is outdated, but so what! It's the food that makes this place a must try..and prices are reasonable. Staff is friendly too. We've had Italian in San Fran and Boston...now we've found a new gem that's right up there with the best!"}
{"text":"3,5 stars... Pretty decent Italian restaurant, but a bit annoying. The same as other reviews, we found this place while walking and we were stopped by a man who told us about their 5 star chef and stories of how people love it from all over... So we went in after walking through the rest of the neighborhood. Compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood, this one is actually pretty cheap. The menu is semi-authentic with some really interesting Italian specialties. We started off with a small Caesar salad, which for $7, or so, it was tiny. Enough to start off one person's meal. But it was served on a heart plate, which was kind of them. Service, not too shabby. From other reviews, though, they say that it took forever. Not for us, since we came at around 6 or so for dinner. The woman, who must have been the owner('s wife) was very friendly and recommended some options for us to try. She was also bilingual in what must have been three languages, which was also really special. The main courses where quite small, but we're filling. The pasta with clam sauce was not what I had expected. I pictured the sauce to use a bit of a wine reduction with olive oil for a transparent look and a liquid texture. This was just an Alfredo sauce, very creamy. It didn't make the pasta flow like it used to. Also, they must be quite clever because with such a creamy texture, it's hard to identify what is in your dish. I couldn't tell there were clams in there. There seemed to be only a few, which was disappointing. The lasagna, which the guy had front said people raved about, was tasty, but not the most amazing thing on the menu. Most of their pasta dishes start with a vodka based sauce. The lasagna had all of the key components and had a delicious taste. Small, but appetizing. The cannelloni was also very good. Possibly the best dish out of the three. Decor, checkerboard tablecloths, cheap chairs. If you want a good meal, come here, if you want an outstanding meal, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Il n'y a rien d'italien dans ce restaurant mise à part trois ou quatres babioles accrochées au mur. Quel est l'interet d'avoir un four à bois si on n'y fait que décongeler des pizzas surgelées ?

Avec une amie j'y suis allée un lundi soir, nous étions seules dans le restaurant. Bien que ça aurai pu nous mettre la puce à l'oreille, nous avons néanmoins commandé un plateau d'antipasti de fruit de mer, puis des pizzas.

A peine deux minutes plus tard voici qu'arrive une assiette avec trois feuilles de salades flétries avec le contenu d'une boîte de conserve de fruits de mer, inmangeables. Tout avait le même goût extremement vinaigé, on ne distinguait même plus ce qu'il y avait dans cette bouillie pas tres appétissante.

Mais nous n'avons pas perdu espoir de manger, en nous disant que les pizzas devaient forcément être mangeable, c'est la spécialité de l'endroit ! Et là elles sont arrivées. J'avai fait l'erreur de prendre une calzone, je me suis retrouvée avec un énorme biscuit sec et dur fourré avec trois olives et un peu de sauce tomate. Je n'avais jamais vu quelque chose qui soit aussi éloigné d'une pizza italienne ! Les photos que j'ai posté pourront en témoigner.

Malgré tout la seule étoile de mon vote va pour le service, un serveur gentil qui paraissait dégoûté de travailler dans ce restaurant, et qui s'est sincèrement excusé a voir notre dépit en nous confirmant que ce qu'il servait était tout issu de boîtes ou de surgelé.

C'est bien trop cher pour une nourriture aussi mauvaise."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza. We didn't expect much when we saw it but went in anyway. Food is fresh and service is superb. Owner is very passionate about his business. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Based on some of the reviews I expected the food to be better.  Went here last night looking for a great meal.  I'd call it average. No homemade bread and the shrimp in the fettuccine were from a can.  Definitely disappointed.  Finally, the decor could use some updating which is easily forgiven if the food is great, but not the case."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza with a great authentic feeling Italian pizza place feel. Was packed at 9pm when we went."}
{"text":"I was staying in Montreal for the weekend, and after going to Eggspectation and Dagwoods (Both you should definitely try) me and my family, all 8 of us, we wanted something new. I was walking down Stanley earlier in the day, and I remembered an Italian place on the way down the street. So I asked them if they were in the mood for pasta and pizza and we headed on our way. 

This place is off of one of the main streets in Centre-Ville, So apparently many do not bother to go down the street. But I am happy I did. First of all, we called for a reservation only 15 minutes before we arrived, but they already had jumbled up a group of tables for my large family. They actually recognized us from the phone and sat us right down. There were not many people in the place when we were there, and the big wood oven was calming. The bread, I admit, was one of the 2 downs about the place. It was stale. But the pasta sauce was great, as I went with the classic penne and meatsauce. Perfect blend of spice and flavor. I also had some of the pizza. The one I got looked perfect, and tasted even better.( Is there even a word for better than perfect?) 
The bill at the end was very cheap considering the quality and quantity of the food we got. 

The last down was the bathroom. You have to go thru the kitchen to get to it, and it made me feel uneasy. When you finally get there, it is poorly lit and cold. To make matters worse, it was probably, maybe, 1 foot wide at most. I had to go sideways to go thru there. If you can, avoid going to the bathroom here.

Overall though, are waiter was fantastic, the food was of good quality, the price was right, the food was prepared quickly, and it has a pretty nice, quiet, during the day location. Recommended to tourists looking for a quick, quality, and affordable meal near the heart Centre-Ville."}
{"text":"Classy? No. Fashionable? No. Authentic? YES! Hearty Italian food, just like Mama makes it. Great value for money.

PS: The 'wood oven' (sauna?) is really a brick oven that's wood-fired! And thank you for that - most excellent pizzas!"}
{"text":"Had the veal, shrimp, pasta combination and it was excellent. Nice mushroom sauce on the veal and the 3 large shrimp were topped with a nice marinara sauce. Nice combo with the pasta made for a tasty meal for an affordable price. My wife had lazania which was topped with nice layer of cheese. Highly recommend if you want a good meal in an a classic italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Santa Lucia loses one star because of the atmosphere + interior. 
I read good reviews before I went with my boyfriend but hesitated to enter because of very old looking sign and exterior..

We went in, and there was one table of customers. Very not impressive. We stayed because we were tired of looking around for restaurants and hungry for Italian food.

We ordered seafood fettuccine with white sauce and Hawaiian pizza. 
It was very authentic and we LOVED it ! Both dishes were very rich in flavours..!

Seafood pasta actually had lots of seafood in it! Some calamari, many mussels, crab meat. It was very creamy and we ate every drop of the sauce with the bun that were given.

Pizza was GREAT. Thin dough, rich flavourful tomato sauce, sweet pinapples and ham. Other table ordered two pizzas and it looked like the pizza was packed with meat! It looked very good.

Service was not bad. 

I would give this place 5/5 if they changed the exterior and interior  .. to dull and old fashioned.

However! GO HERE! TRY THERE AUTHENTIC FOOD! It was so great that my boyfriend and I barely talked to each other while having late lunch :D 

We kept saying...      wow..... wow.. it's so good.. wow...  :) 

Price was around 25 dollars I think. which is not bad at all.

You won't regret it. Go. Now."}
{"text":"They have everything you need :) reasonable pricing + a creative and interesting menu with various options + a 5 star chef to get you the best quality of the meal + and the best part: The Golden Wood Oven ;)"}
{"text":"Restaurant Santa Lucia has a lot going for it - great location, capable waitstaff, an enticing menu, and a seemingly skilled chef. This restaurant could really be great if they could improve on the quality of their ingredients. 

We started out with an appetizer of escargot, which my wife usually insists on. The sauce was delicious, but the snails were obviously not fresh and that really killed the dish.

For entrees, I had a calzone while my wife opted for a veggie pizza. The presentation was great, and the homemade wood-fire cooked pizza dough was fantastic. Once we hit the toppings though, the honeymoon was over. The onions in my calzone were raw and totally overpowering. My wife said most of the vegetables on her pizza tasted canned and were nearly inedible. We both picked everything off and ended up eating mostly dough and sauce (which were good!).

If Santa Lucia steps up and starts buying fresh ingredients to pair with their great pizza dough and sauces, it could really shine."}
{"text":"Do not be scared away by the dated bizarre décor!  The food here was really good.  Best part, my picky children ate their entire meals.  They catered to my son and made his pasta to his exact specifications.  The pasta bolgenese was great and carbonara too.  The price was just right."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! We had the fettuccine with white sauce which was good but the penne with white and red sauce mixed was the most incredible pasta ive had! The pasta itself was very soft and tastes homemade and fresh. And the sauce was so delicious. The service was abit slow but besides that, the location, the reasonable price, the food and the quaint decor was all fantastic."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant italien, pas très chic mais vraiment bien ! Leur pizza cuite au four est incroyable ! De plus, il y a une bonne variété de pizza mais aussi de tous les autres mets. Le service était bien aussi :)"}
{"text":"Never eating there again.
So we were convinced by the \"salesguy\" who waits on the corner to convince people passing by to eat there that it was worth a try. We sat down on the most uncomfortable chairs, the place looked really drab and when we got our \"sauteed mushroom entree\" it was nothing more than sliced mushrooms in a weird tasting thick sauce. Even our vegetarian pizza was disappointing! Would not go back."}
{"text":"I had neapolitan pasta, and sincerely, it didn't make the cut (read: it didn't taste authentic). The sauce was too oily and mushy, it missed the taste of fresh tomatoes. My coworkers tried the pizza and they were quite happy with it. Otherwise, we went there during lunch time (week day) and since the restaurant was full it took them about 30 minutes to serve us. Just something to be mindful of when you go during work."}
{"text":"I finally tried this resto a few weeks ago and was pleasantly satisfied with their food, service, and their table du hote prices. Not the most wonderful decor in the dining area but it's appropriate for the price you pay, and I was impressed with the quality of my meal. All good! I would recommend this place to all tourists looking for a home style supper at a great price and right mid downtown. I am going to eat there tonight actually!"}
{"text":"Location: In the heart of downtown, tucked away on Stanley between Rene-Levesque and Ste-Catherine. The hipsters haven't invaded this place yet so don't expect anything fancy - the decor probably hasn't been updated since the place opened. It's very mom & pop but that's part of its charm.

Food: I always have their pizza - no complaints here. They make it in their wood oven and offer a variety of toppings. The pizzas are cooked to perfection with just a hint of crisp on the outer edge of the crust, the tomato sauce is bursting with flavor yet not at all acidic, and well, the pizza is just damn good. What else do you need to know?  

Service: It's pretty good though can be slow when they're busy. If you plan to stop by for lunch during the work week, get there before Noon. 

Price: Very reasonable compared to other restaurants in the downtown core."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.

Quite friendly and attentive service but I don't think pasta was anything special. Pizza was not good at all. Complimentary bread was cheap dinner roll-type.  For the price, it's OK but the old lady server insisted the minimum tip is 15%. According to the locals, standard tip in Quebec is 10%. 

This is a place where you want to eat something to keep you full without caring any ambiance.  If you want a memorable visit and good food, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had the alldressed oven pizza and it was really good. Not the thin crust that they you see too many around.  A pizza here will satisfy your appetite. The place though needs to be freshened up a little."}
{"text":"It was a great dinner at Santa Lucia during my short trip to Montreal. The atmosphere was warm and had a traditional Italian home feeling. We had a party of four and we tried their specials of the day that came with bread, a salad or soup, then the entree and a choice of cake, coffee or tea. It was a pretty good deal. I had their thin crust pizza with Italian sausage and peppers. It was nice to see the pizza freshly made out of their flame stone oven. It was crispy on the crust and had a good amount of toppings. We finished with the tiramisu cake which was average. We also had the cappucino to warm it all off before walking back into the ice cold weather outside."}
{"text":"Went with the family after looking for a place with a wholesome meal at a reasonable price.  The pizza was good here but the pasta dishes, both Veal and Seafood, were great.  The Sol dish was very surprising.  Service was quite good too, for just 2 people on the evening we went.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We came here when we didn't know what to eat one night. We wanted Italian food but didn't want to spend $25 per dish either.  

I remember seeing this place and liked the vibe as it didn't seem pretentious.  We ordered a seafood pasta and pizza.  The pizza was okay, but I found the crust to be too think.  It didn't have that crunch that wood oven pizzas usually have. 

With regards the pasta, it was quite creamy and nice.  Great flavouring, but it wasn't cooked al-dente.  

However, service was fast and our waitress was very friendly.

Verdict: average place, good service, great for a \"normal\" meal."}
{"text":"This $15 seafood & salad calzone was tremendous. Very Italian, very good, very big. I can only imagine it was fired in the wood-burning oven, a nice touch for those who enjoy the slight smoky aroma. Despite the food being decent here, decor & signage is dated enough that you wouldn't bring a date. Rather, it's a nice place for lunch with coworkers or a non-romantic pal. The salad, like the decor, was a dated standard and slightly disappointing. Overall a solid B-, somewhere I would come back to but not go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Ordered via foodora*
The delivery was on point. I have to say this is the worst carbonara Ive ever had. Very very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Really like this place! Good food, great price and lovely staff. I loved that they start you off with warm fresh bread and loads of butter and our waitress was very lovely and attentive. I ordered the clam pasta with rose sauce which came up to $18 including tip and tax. Although the noodles weren't hand made, the sauce was yummy and they did not skimp on the clams! My boyfriend ordered the manicotti and there was sooooooo much cheese it was delicious! The portions are huge! Only 1 person in our group of 6 finished their meal, everyone else had to take a doggie bag!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We tried 7 different dishes and everyone loved their food. Only bad thing, we ordered for pick up after they said that delivery would take 2 hours and we waited over 30 minutes once we got there when they said to. But the food itself is awesome."}
{"text":"Ate there tonight. Took quite awhile to be waited on. Manicotti was good, fish was overcooked but okay. Only complaint was the service. Asked four times for water and never got it."}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong with this place but nothing that would draw you out of your way to go there either.  

I had the Vegetarian Pizza + Pepperoni (ya, I know ... sorry about that Vegans). It was ok.  Sort of the McDonalds of pizza.  Nothing bad but nothing specifically good. 

When I'm in the area and hungry for pizza, I'll look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Small place, excellent food. The best food in montreal so far. Good price. Everything was fresh. I loved. Try to eat their mango cake for desert."}
{"text":"An Italian dive on Stanley St. In Montreal. Will let you know how that goes. The pizza is cooked in a \"wood oven\" and just arrived and looks pretty damn fine. The pizza was good but not great. Returned a week later to have Veal Limonene, but that was disappointing."}
{"text":"Randomly tried this place.  OMG the za was AWESOME. true wood feed stove.  Ignore what it looks like the food is the best.  And some hot waitresses."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident, walking past it last week while a guy stood out front in a suit and told me everything I didn't want to know about it. So ventured back there this week, and there he was, still trying to pull them in.
Waited WAY too long to finally order. Kind of had to wave my arms to get some attention. The bread isn't bad at all. The minestrone was mostly vegetable soup. Also not bad, but not what I've come to expect from minestrone. 
The spaghetti Napolitano was a bit greasy, and the sauce was very thick. Overall it was not a wonderful meal. The waitstaff were very nice, once I'd gotten their attention. I really wanted to like this place, but eh. I might swing by on the next trip and try the pizza I've heard so much about. But there are a LOTTA choices in the area."}
{"text":"You know that frozen grocery store pizza you keep in the freezer for emergencies that you bought because it was on sale and then had to add a bunch of your own ingredients to make it palatable?....that's the one."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I had to after eating at this restaurant unfortunately twice. Came to the restaurant around 4:30 on a Saturday and waited for a fresh cheese pizza. I was really excited about the brick oven. The pizza took about 15 minutes and the staff was pretty friendly. However, when I dug into the pizza I was extremely disappointed. This was without a doubt the worse pizza I've ever eaten. Just soft bread and cheese, no sauce. Unfortunately, later that night my friends ordered pizza before I came back around 9 and they made the same mistake I did. The second time was actually worse. I can't stress enough how bad the pizza was."}
{"text":"Very very good food. Busy little place must be patient. Servers were busy but took good care of us in time! Lasagne was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Delicious, casual Italian eatery downtown.  I had the gnocchi and the escargot--both delicious. The bread is also great, and there's a good selection of wine, beer, cocktails, etc."}
{"text":"What can you say about Santa Lucia? The place is a dive a gigantic dive in need of the greatest restaurant makeover conceivable. The carpet is so old, they don't vacuum it, the mop it. The tables and chairs are probably older than me. The wait staff is comprised of grandmothers. The pizza guys often stink. There are really old wine bottles in rattan baskets hanging on the ugly walls. The ceiling is a total loss. The whole place says \"DO NOT EAT HERE\"

But you will anyway. Why? They serve what is probably the greatest old-school thick, hot, delicious, cheesy, meaty pizzas in Montreal. Bonus? All baked in one of the rare brick wood ovens left in Montreal. The pastas pretty tasty to. Old school Italian wedding soup. 

If the 3 cheese pizza doesn't make you want to kick your head back, roll your eyes and let out a huge sigh of orgasmic contentment, then hit the Bolognese pizza, meat sauce, onions, bacon, cheese and a guaranteed mindblowing experience.

The place is awesome in its shittyness. But it doesn't stop people from pilling in since 1967. If you show up at 12h05 on a weekday, you're shit outta luck because the place is packed, half the tables already reserved. Try to show up at the very latest 20 minutes before noon. Service is fast and polite. Prices are cheap when compared to the awesomeness you'll be hovering faster than a porn star... well you get the point."}
{"text":"This little Italian spot in the business district of Montreal, Canada is a neighborhood GEM. Quaint and warm Italian  atmosphere, with checkered tablecloths and comfortable chairs, features a real BRICK OVEN. Louis, the pizza artist, turns out some special stuff. We shared the Pizza Bolognese, an 8 incher with crisp bacon, sausage and onions. It was very good. I rated it a 7 out of 10. The sause was too understated, or I would have rated it higher. We also share the Lasagna. It was baked casserole style, and was very tasty. All in all, I would give this little place 3 1/2 stars out of 5. I'd hit this place again if I return to Montreal"}
{"text":"I was happy to randomly try this place after getting back to Montreal on the train. Location is near downtown and I just googled mapped near-by restaurants that were still open late. There are not a lot of pasta dish options, but I got exactly what I wanted. I ordered Penne Romanoff and tasted a bit of the Ravioli Basilicata. They were both tasty, the first one is with vodka sauce and the second one is stuffed with ricotta, tomato and spinach with a pesto sauce.  If I have a vodka sauce craving I might come back for it! 

Staff was also super friendly and the resto had a homey welcoming feel with dimmed lights."}
{"text":"I often hesitate to order pasta at an Italian restaurant, thinking that I could easily do a decent pasta job at home myself. And then I had Santa Lucia's linguini alle vongole with white sauce. I take my food reviews seriously so believe me when I say nobody... yes... nobody in Montreal could make pasta sauce that unforgettable. It just has that 'wow' factor that makes you start planning your next trip before you even finish the dish. Proof: I've been going there and ordering the same dish in the last five years. So there, 'nuf said.

PS: the place looks like someone's outdated living room, so if 'hip' is what you're looking for, this isn't it."}
{"text":"I think they do a very credible job with all their dishes and they have been very consistent over the years. Located on Stanley street they are in the heart of  downtown Montreal and within easy walking distance of most of the local hotels. The food comes out quickly from the kitchen or pizza oven; I have found the table service to be very good even when the restaurant has been busy. Santa Lucia represents a good dining value in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I loved this place! We are here today and I got the Cappelletti while my husband got a pizza and shared the bruschetta. We each loved our food and highly recommend it. 

The location was right off the main road, easy to find but not so loud and crowded. It was very clean and beautiful on the inside and I love the brick pizza oven. 

The staff was all extremely kind and helpful when conversed with about tourist attractions and other  useful information. Lovely people working at a lovey place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night as it was close by and we were in the mood for Italian. I had been here years ago with my mom. Our usual pizza go-to at the time, Pasquale's, had closed so this was our next option. It's an unassuming place just below Ste-Catherine on Stanley, right next to Chez Parée and La Boom. The decor is very homey (read: looks like eating at nonna's). I believe the place is run by a man from Bangladesh, but the recipes are authentic Italian and are well-executed. All pizzas (and calzones if I'm not mistaken) are cooked in the wood-burning oven, which faces the dining room. Our server was very nice; she was attentive and friendly. I ordered the ham-onion-bacon pizza (I cannot for the life of me remember the name of it!), and it turned out to be the perfect portion for me. Crust was nice and crisp (a definite must!), but wasn't burnt (i.e. still had that fluffy, doughy inside). It wasn't greasy and the taste was pretty good. All others enjoyed their meals as well (tortellini gigi, calzone and pizza). All in all we most definitely enjoyed our experience and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"ordered delivery from santa lucia using foodora. very disappointed with the food i tried. the garlic bread tasted like the frozen variety you get at a grocery store and cook in the oven - but at a 900% markup. the linguini vongole was even worse: lots of bland tasting cream (odd since all previous linguini vongole's i've had no cream), zero taste of white wine, and i strongly suspect that the clams were canned rather than fresh. i definitely won't be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Very slow. We didn't even get to try the food as after half an hour there, they still hadn't started an order of Garlic bread and pizza. There were a total of 3 tables in the restaurant. Just awful."}
