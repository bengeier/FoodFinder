{"text":"first off, it surprises me Yunaghi hasn't gotten more good press.  they deserve it. there isn't anyone else doing the same thing in Toronto at that price point. the beautiful composition of each dish takes care and attention to detail. seasonal menus (it was Oct when I went), and options for wine or sake only pairings.  servers were friendly and explained each dish (sometimes a bit challenging to ask more questions but they tried to answer). i would return to see what's on offer next year!"}
{"text":"The only question is why isn't it packed? This is one of the most interesting restaurants in Toronto, such a creative and inspirational fusion . . . 

We've come here for quite a while, so this review covers a number of visits - all delightful, all different, all quite good.

Every visit brings a change to the menu - the tasting menus change, the ideas change (brunch this summer was quite special and the noodle night was a very cool idea) - the chefs are creative and inspired. The whole experience is always filled full of such carefully conceived and executed fusion ideas. Presented with exact and such attentive service, very nice ambiance and such attention to every detail.

We only get here 3-4 times a year, but every visit is a home run. It's unlike anything else, and it deserves to be full. Can't wait for what comes next!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Might be the best Japanese food in Toronto.  Go for the full tasting menu--it's pricey but worth every penny. The sake pairing was a nice complement.  I actually think the pork there was so good it actually upgraded itself to beef!

Take a special someone there for a special occasion and learn to fall in love all over again."}
{"text":"Amazing taste, beautiful presentation and attentive service. Definitely recommended.

My only issue is that the menu was not filling at all. We were still hungry after 9 courses!

The restaurant is very small (only seats about 25), so be sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Nice presentation.  Good food but not amazing.  Price is reasonable for what you are getting.  We ordered the 9 course and was full by the end.

Worth a try."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Fusion kaiseki menu utilizing seasonal ingredients at very reasonable prices: 7 courses for $68 or 9 courses for $80. Option to upgrade mushroom sticky rice from shimeji to matsutake mushrooms for an extra $5.  Add beef tartar course for $15. 

Modern decor and excellent service!  Within walking distance from Christie Station.

-0.5 star for charging green tea by the (small) cup with no refills. Ok, organic or roasted green tea @ $2 per cup isn't too bad.  But come on, I'd rather pay a bit more to have a pot instead."}
{"text":"Totally blown away. Amazing presentation, unexpected flavors, everything just worked so well. The staff were extremely attentive and the set menu was excellent value for money. For most of the evening, we were the only two guests. Hope their other nights are busier, would hate to see such an innovative restaurant go under."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!

Called on Saturday afternoon for a reservation that night, they were able to accommodate us at the bar.  

Ambience: The place is small, maybe fits 25 ppl max, modern clean decor.  

Service:  Excellent!  Very attentive, friendly staff.  We were greeted at our table by a cute little paper crane with my name on it, a clever alternative to the usual \"reserved\" sign.  The kitchen is partly open, and we could see the chef and other kitchen staff checking on us from afar, making sure we enjoyed our meal. 

Food: Mindblowing!  We chose the 9 course tasting, I got the drink pairing (additional $40) which included a mix of cocktails, sake, and wine for a total of 6 drinks.  My bf got the $50 sake pairing.  All the courses from the hamachi crudo to the key lime cheesecake dessert were impeccably prepared and meticulously plated.  My favorite was the salmon sous-vide, it was very flavorful without being fishy, and the sauce had so much depth of flavor and a great spice to it.  The only (small) complaint I had was the romaine lettuce soup, although cool concept, just tasted like a really well-made miso soup. 

Overall: Great value!  Amazing food and service, on par with Michelin-rated restaurants around the world, for a very reasonable price.  I was surprised the place isn't more packed, there were 3 empty tables and some open seats at the bar.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had the 9 course menu and it was absolutely amazing. A dining experience I will never forget.  The food was so unique and prepared with such thought and passion.  We were also gifted with a foie gras dish on the house. Yunaghi is hands down one of the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been to.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails, true one of a kind! 
Astounding food; flavours, textures, presentation and all the other pretentious words one can use to describe truly innovative and impressive food.
9 course option was perfect. Very filling.
Second time I've been. Would go again. Eating at the bar was more fun than the tables."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Great atmosphere! A small cozy restaurant with delightful dishes. The portions are a little on the small side and left me wanting more. My biggest complaint is the $2 charge for a cup of green tea."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 5 stars. From the moment I walked in, I felt remarkably calm. Even though it was 7:30PM on a Friday night, there were perhaps 10 other diners scattered around the restaurant (overall, Yunaghi maybe seats ~25). You could barely hear the other patrons over the smooth jazz that was on. 

When you are seated at your table by one of the exceptionally polite servers / hostesses, there is a little origami placeholder waiting for you (sadly, no amuse-bouche).The service is quick, and at the one odd moment when our procession of food was delayed, our waitress offered us a complimentary non-alcoholic drink (tasted like ginger 7 Up - delicious). The 6 course tasting menu is only $50 (!!!), and the sake pairing is $35. I would recommend Yunaghi if you're a fan of (i) attentive service, (ii) artistic meal presentation and / or (iii) trying different sakes (my favourite was the sake mixed with kombucha, served first).

. . . Sadly, I just couldn't get over how underwhelmed I was by the food! The first course tasted like a custard version of miso soup (served cold).The second course was a selection of mini appetizers, of which none were particularly remarkable. The third course was a warm soup, with a tiny slice of seabream (of note, I would say this sake pairing was the most intriguing). The fourth course was slices of pork jowl (which was ironically overwhelmingly salty) and random vegetables. The fifth course was a \"make your own sushi\" adventure, with a lot of black squid-ink rice and barely any fish. Finally, the dessert was disjointed, but pleasant.

I understand that you get what you pay for. Some of the prior raving reviews clearly were related to a more expensive tasting menu - one I wish we were offered, by the sounds of their experience vs. ours. Oh well!"}
{"text":"I've decided to give this restaurant a try as I wanted quality good Japanese food to end my Friday. Anyways, the reservation paper crane, they wrote Mr. Wang instead of Ms. Wong. So I've sent it back and the service was excellent. They wrote a new one for me and apologize. My boyfriend and I ordered the $100 tasting menu. There is a choice between the $80 and $100 tasting menu and they only serve tasting menu.  I ordered the pairing drinks for additional $45. The roasted duck texture was rough, the sea lettuce jelly was blend. Only the Kobe Beef Tartare tasted good. There was a course where there was winter melons, again it was blend and nothing to write home about.

The Yakimono- the beets overpowers the beef flavour. The lobster was not bad. I feel like the Shokuji, chicken, carrot and nori was like to make sure you are full towards the end.

The Kanmi-Matcha, Yuzu, White Chocolate, Pistachio. It felt like a deconstructed dessert where nothing really went well with each other. The waitress was friendly and service was good. Anyways, a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Had the 9 course meal as well as the wine pairing. Great meal. Just a heads up to those who are expecting sushi - they don't serve it here. It's dishes. Very good dishes. Decent selection of sake as well. I'd summarize this place as Kaji without the sushi and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Yunaghi to try out their 9 course omakase. 
There is a choice of $80/$100 - we chose the latter since we wanted the toro. Service was excellent and the display of the food was very pretty but the food quality was not good...D: We were pretty disappointed with our food experience here. 

Drinks:
* Honey Yuzu
* Sapporo

Here are the 9 course menu:

The items with *asterisk* were the ones that made the $20 difference between the $80 / $100 omakase.

SAKIZUKE (2/5)
[Mountain yam and Almond Snap Pea]
The mountain yam was infused with wasabi flavour; I give this +2 points.
The peas had no taste.

HASSUN (3.5/5)
[Mountain Vege, Bottarga Sushi, Octopus, King Fish, Fiddlehead, Salmon Sakura Sushi, Burdock Root, Sweet Cherry Tomato, Zuke Maguro*]
The sweet cherry tomato was good. The maguro, I expected it to be more fresh. Everything else on the platter was okay.

WANMANO (1/5)
[Shinjo, Carrot, Parsnip, Edamame, Pistachio]
I give this dish a 1 because it was lukewarm when it came out ?_? Is it supposed to be a hot / cold dish? The taste was off too.

HIYASHI BASHI (3/5)
[Asparagus, Dashi, Rutabaga, Celery Root]
The interesting thing about this dish is that the salty mochi (sticky rice) was asparagus flavoured. Pretty cool :O

MUSHIMONO (2/5)
[Egg, Clam, Rapini]
This was disappointing because I love Japanese steamed egg custard (chawanmushi). There was not enough taste to this, too bland for my liking :(

YAKIMONO (1/5)
[Cod, Shio Koji, Red Pepper, Jerusalem Artichoke, Calamari*]
Biggest disappointment of the night D: I don't recall ever not liking any codfish dishes.. but this codfish had no tasteeee lollll

NIMONO (2/5)
[Pork, Ginger, Red Cabbage, Daikon, Pearl Onion, Beef Pâté*]
The +2 points all goes to the beef pâté. Both my boyfriend's and my dish's pork chunks were raw. We actually returned both our dishes to our waitress lol

SHOKUJI (3.5/5)
[Sea Bream, Konbu, Sakura, Toro*]
We were so happy that something we had was actually sizzling hot!! *finallyy*
This was good - rice + soup mix together with the sea bream.

KANMI (2.5/5)
[Yogurt Mousse, Hojicha, Rhubarb, Raspberry, Strawberry]
Very creative with the plating and decor of the dessert but the ingredients that they chose to mix together for this dessert doesn't seem to blend well together.

Will not return -_-"}
{"text":"The restaurant had nice service in a pleasant, small atmosphere. This is perhaps the only good thing about the Yunaghi experience. Unfortunately the tasting menu was a huge disappointment for me and my guest, who found all the food too salty, and didn't appreciate the excessive repetition of dashi broth, winter melon and soft tofu. The fish quality was mediocre at best, which was a huge shock. The Yunaghi Caesar beverage was easily the worst Caesar I have ever tasted. The fusion of French and Japanese has potential, but Yunaghi didn't achieve it.  I mentioned this to the restaurant but they were dismissive and trying to turn my table so they can \"process\" the next couple with their fast food fine dining experience. It was all too formulaic and distracting - really a very poor experience unbefitting sophisticated Toronto diners. Save yourself $300 and rather go to one of Toronto's many other options that are vastly superior."}
{"text":"I took my mother to this restaurant and we both loved it. We were waiting for an appointment at Curl Ambassadors and the staff highly recommended.  The food was very tasty, the shop is very interesting and different and the staff were friendly. We really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Had 7 course menu, dishes are like miniature food, it is great if you don't have big appetite otherwise, you won't be satisfied. The dishes are very dedicated and well presented. The description of the dishes can be better.."}
{"text":"There's something wonderful happening at Harbord and Manning: Chef Tetsuya Shimizu is turning out exquisite prix fixe dinners of exceptional quality with creativity, flair, and incredible enthusiasm. The staff are great, friendly, and knowledgable -- and the cocktails and sake pairings work beautifully with the main show. If you love Japanese food and want to get well beyond sushi and sashimi, head to Yunaghi where for $80 a head you will be transported for a few hours to a very joyful gustatory realm. Honestly, this is the most exciting dinner I've had in the downtown core in many years.  Standouts for us were the two \"mains\"  to which the tasting menu builds: the spanish mackerel and the pork belly.

Ive never given five stars before -- but Chef Shimizu thoroughly deserves a top rating"}
{"text":"The worst thing about Yunaghi is the knowledge that dinner service will end.

Stepping into the restaurant on a Wednesday night, we were pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't overly crowded, especially at the bar where we had requested seats.

After our first cocktails (the refreshing and fruit filled Sake Sangria), we embarked on the tasting menu with the regular drink pairing. 

The first item sent to us was a Hamachi and miso amuse-bouche, in a Dashi tea. The small dish was delicate and sweet, the miso not at all overpowering. 

Next, the sashimi\" platter arrived, an elegant tile covered in wonderful confections, including a standout Chicken Sashimi. For those worried, the chicken is cured, not raw, and absolutely mouthwatering. Equally delicious, the Conch in stock practically defined the word \"Umami\". Less impressive, the Edamame mousse - which tasted bland and sticky - and the Shrimp jello, which consisted of an over-cooked shrimp in a cold gelatinous casing.

Our next course was presented with a flourish of smoke and drama - a \"Dashissoise\" playing both on the idea of classic French cold soup, and, well, Corned Beef. It was, for lack of a better description, effing yummy.

The fourth course consisted of a lovely \"vegetable garden\", complete with whimsical \"soil\" made out of fried Panko and olive crumbs. That 'Furikake' carried the dish. While winter melon is typically not the best Asian vegetable, the cubed and pickled gourd was crisp and fruity. A helping of fresh green peas certainly improved the vegetable course.

The middle of the meal was upon us, and so was one of the best things I have ever tasted. Chawanmushi, an ordinary egg pudding most Asian families are familiar with, was elevated to a height I had not expected, with the addition of Truffle oil and Grana Padano. It was comfort food turned into rich decadence, with the addition of two simple ingredients.

It was therefore disappointing when next, the Nanban course arrived with a lacklustre soue-vied salmon paired with a boring Harissa sauce. 

Disillusionment did not last for long. The next platter, a play on a very familiar meal of ham, beans and sausage, was covered in a buttery white sauce and cubes of fried Boudin Noir. Creamy blood sausage, pork fat...what's not to love? The cleverness of playing with such familiar ingredients - much like the Chawanmushi - contributed greatly to the enjoyment.

Dessert did provide one last lovely surprise; savoury flavours mixed with sweet (such a sure facet of Asian desserts) was a wonderful way to end the evening. Who knew edamame and chocolate would work so well together?

Aside from the food, the wine pairing throughout the meal was not exactly great. Ontario whites - reeking of bad grapes - did not deserve the foods they were paired with. The one Sake we were served told me that for ten dollars more, the Sake  pairing is probably the way to go in the future.

The clientele ranged from dignified Japanese men savouring every last item, to kids who didn't look up from their smartphones long enough to interact with each other, much less to enjoy the food set before them. 

Ultimately, the bad of this dining experience did not come close to outweighing the good. For the price and the quality, this restaurant is worth revisiting."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice place to eat where the courses build upon themselves and your taste buds get teased and pleased, I am going to say, go here. 

There are 3 prix fixe options: 7, 9 and 11. There is also a drink pairing or a sake pairing option for each (priced differently, because I'm guessing there are more drinks for more courses). The courses were actually of appropriate size. And after the end of 7 courses, my girlfriend and I were both very full. We were surprised to read a small number of reviews which said they felt the portions were too small and weren't full afterwards. The drink pairing that we had was fantastic. It went very well with the courses we had. I can still remember the first two drinks vividly: the sake with yuzu juice, and the \"pearls of perfection\" were awesome!

We thought the food tasted amazing. It's very pretty (as all the other reviewers have pointed out).  But more importantly, it's very easy to notice that a lot of planning went into how the courses and items connected with one another. The taste of pumpkin was carried over quite a bit in our meal. All the elements sort of spoke for themselves within each course--each element served a very nice purpose, and of course the quality of the products made them taste very good. There was a slice of duck meat that I can still picture the taste of right now...and I can remember the smile on my face when I ate it! The term we used to describe the food was that it was \"slap-the-table\" good. Every course was bang on.

The restaurant is small. I think a reservation may help, but I didn't think it was necessary when we went last night. There were only 4 tables being served last night. I felt like that lead to a nice ambience (not overly crowd, not a lot of hustle/bustle). We certainly spent longer than 2 hours there (which I think was supposed to be the allotted number of hours for the reservation?), but no one complained! 

The service was outstanding. The plates were explained to us very clearly. When we asked questions, they made sure to relate their answers in a way that we could understand it. And most importantly, the staff was friendly and smiled lots.

One thing I didn't see notice in other reviews is that dishes here is that there is red meat in some courses (I guess I didn't read the reviews closely enough...). One of us can't eat shellfish (me), and the other doesn't eat meat. Unfortunately, not knowing this, I only told the staff about my shellfish allergy when I made the reservation. So I ended up eating parts of her dish that had meat in it. She didn't mind, but I wish I had known so that we could have told them ahead of time in order for her to have a complete experience.

Overall, I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"We had the 9 course tasking menu and it was amazing. Everything was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. The sous vide salmon plate was especially good!

Highly recommended, one of the best restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Excellent and amazing! Service there was really good and all of us liked every dishes!  I've already recommended it to my friends. We will visit again and hope to have different dishes next time."}
{"text":"One of the most worth going japanese suicines in town. The menu is set as a 7 cources meal which changes oftenly. Dishes were amazing with full of creation (combination of Japanese and french style). My favourate is the egg pudding with truffle. The beef tasts awesome too. (in fact everything is pretty good) The server was so nice and introduced every single dish throughly to us. Great experience with a reasonable price. Plannung to have another meal for the next menu."}
{"text":"We tried the tasting menu and really enjoyed it. A delicious selection of freshly prepared dishes that kept coming. Small place so reservations are necessary. Ambience is quiet and pleasant. Service was very good and definitely superior to other Toronto restaurants. The tasting menu at $80 per person is very reasonable. Yunaghi is not at all like the other Japanese sushi places in the area and ranks among the top Japanese in the city."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for the 80$ tasting menu and the experience was subpar. Perhaps my expectation was too high from such glorious praises and reviews that I found all over the internet about this place. The food was not bad but nothing was blow your mind spectacular, and I found many items were too heavily salted, especially the corn soup. My favourite dish was the egg/dashi dish with aubergines; any time I get egg yolk food porn I'm sold. 

As an aspiring cook, I appreciate the use of many french techniques in the preparation and presentation of the food and the texture of the sous-vide pork loin and salmon was on point, although the salmon skin could have been done crispier to add more texture to the dish. Also I think the dish portions could be slightly bigger. The highlight of our dinner was a 30$ Kuheiji sake that was absolutely delicious. The ambience and service was on point although the Japanese server's English accent was barely comprehensible and needs improvement so that the guest can understand the food more. 

Finally, we had a billing misunderstanding but the owner was nice enough to sort it out with me on Yelp. So I have updated my review to three stars instead of two. The service attitude of the owner Yasuko is top-notch, so maybe when they change their menu in the winter I will give this restaurant another go."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday with my boyfriend, and everything was just perfect. The service, the food, and the environment was top notch. 

Yunaghi only offers a tasting menu and we decided to do the $100- 9 course one. Although in pictures it appears as very little food, but i was actually full by the 7th course. The dishes were all so unique, and the plating of each dish is just beyond me. All ingredients were so fresh and high quality - I've never tasted a sweet cherry tomato as good as the one here! ^^' You can truly enjoy and appreciate the flavours of each ingredient.

The service was very welcoming and friendly. The staff was very knowledgeable on their menu items and drinks. Each dish presented in front of you, and then explained - answering any questions you might have. Its a very small restaurant so the staff was very attentive, and service was quick. 

I love how the restaurant is so small, with quiet music in the background. It felt very personal and private which really sets the mood for a nice quiet dinner with your significant other. I think the restaurant seats about 25 people. 

Last but not least, for my birthday they made me a special dessert and sang happy birthday to me. It really ended the dinner/night on a good note and made it a special and memorable experience. 

I would definitely come back when they change up their menu again. And I highly recommend trying this place out for any special occasion."}
{"text":"One of my newest favourites in the city. 

I came here with my parents for my belated birthday dinner and we all enjoyed it immensely. The biggest question my father had was \"why is this place not busier?\". Frankly, after my experience at Yunaghi, I'm also surprised it's not busier. It's a great 'hole-in-the-wall' place that's a little tucked away on Harbour; relatively close to the University of Toronto campus and Splendido/Piano Piano.

I made reservations via the phone approximately 2 weeks before hand and when we arrived we were promptly seated with a simple folded origami crane sitting on the table with my name on it as a reservation sign. Already love the attention to detail.

The entire ambience of the restaurant is remarkably calming.

We opted for the tasting menu which was $50 per person and an additional $35 if you wanted drink pairings (opted out of drinks).

The dishes were timed well and there was no feeling of being rushed. Each dish was immaculately thought out and a perfect balance between Japanese and fusional cuisine. The waitress calmly walked us through each dish. Loved every dish!

Despite looking like smaller portions - our stomachs were pretty satisfied. Though we wanted to try 2 a la carte dishes - the calamari and the liver sashimi. Both were delicious in their own way. 

They also had a special birthday dessert and hand-drawn birthday themed business card with the date written on it to commemorate my special day.

Everyone walked out full and super happy. Would definitely return and highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and thought I would try it out.
Ordered the $100 menu. The service was great, but this review is solely about the food.

The appetizers were good, but it all went downhill from there.
The mains were salmon, beef cheek, and kobe beef. The proteins were overcooked and the beef was very stringy. The worst was the kobe beef - i could buy a better piece of meat from Galleria at half the price. Definitely not what kobe beef should be like.

In summary, i would rather spend an extra $50 at Kaji and be very fulfilled."}
