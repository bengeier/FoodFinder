{"text":"A friend took me here for lunch the other day and I was really impressed with the food. I got the boneless chicken meal with coleslaw... The best coleslaw I've had in my life... Sorry gram... But it was so good. Next time I'm in the area I will stop in for more! It's not a sit down place, order and then pick up, the wait was about 20 minutes which wasn't bad for the amount of people that were before us. Good food good price."}
{"text":"Great Polish Boys And Great Wings!...Love The Sauce!"}
{"text":"On point! Wow blew my mind how good this food is. Long wait, but sooooo worth it. Also loved how this is def a local joint in the hood. Out of towner, and felt welcomed even though I was the only white girl there. :D Get the yams! Thanks Open Pitt!"}
{"text":"Greasy, store is too small, and staff is grouchy will never go back!!!!!! in addition parking is horrible, should add more healthy selections on the menu"}
{"text":"Hi I am a loyal customer of this restaurant for many years but lately when trying to call and order in has been terrible. I have been hung up on numerous times or they just don't answer the phone on Friday night's specially they answer the phone and phone order manners is horrible don't believe me try and call in yourself..."}
{"text":"Good food all the time better then Kim's wings good wholesome girls in there to lol!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a be honest with you I love there chicken its great but the people who work in there all need to be fired if they would get new staff there place would be so much better"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the customer service skills are horrible! This is by far the most rude staff I have ever come across and I don't ever see myself going back. If you order from here brace yourself for the rude employees especially over the phone. I don't know how they have stayed open so long with such terrible customer service skills..."}
{"text":"This is the first time that my meal was horrible!  I've been a patron for a couple of decades and know how the food should taste.  Don't know if you have new cooks using different recipes, but whatever it is, it doesn't work for me or my husband.  The last couple of times our order wasn't complete, always missing the desert.  Absolutely done with Open Pit!!!"}
{"text":"Open Pit has the best barbeque wings ever! The sauce is amazing. We drive there from the Westside to pick up our order! Yummy..."}
{"text":"Best Bbq spot hands down. I've been coming here for years. I wish they would fix the place up and expand a little, but you pay for what you get. The prices are reasonable and the bbq whole wings bang! I suggest calling in your order. There are no tables to sit or anything. It's a pick up and go spot, but they're always crowded especially on Wednesdays and the weekend."}
{"text":"wow once again nobody speaking on a great place to eat in Cleveland...this place is one of my many favorites in the city of cleveland..a must have and the sauce is bomb..."}
{"text":"This is now my new favorite soul food and barbecue spot in Cleveland! Wings are battered and fried extra crispy, just the way I like. Nice wings thru and thru, no veins or grizzle. The rib tips were meaty, not a lot of fat and bone. I thought they were actual ribs! The sauce is like butta. The kicker is, I didn't get to have any for at least a half hour because of the long drive home and I still was loving every bite. Didn't bother trying any sides, sorry, the meat was too good."}
{"text":"Open Pitt. I'm pretty disappointed. I been going here for at least 15 years and the quality and quantity of the food has changed. I recently ordered a wing dinner and I expected 5 wings and a large fry with sauce. When I got it and went home, (me and my girl had the same order), the amount of fries was the same amount that you can get at Wendy's for a small and the wings were barely crispy and my girl asked for sauce on the side and they gave her a tiny side cup of sauce barely enough to pour over her fries. But what about the wings? Maybe I should start going to kims. Open Pitt, you need to stop being cheap on your food. Step your game up!"}
{"text":"At 1 time this used to be a very good barbecue restaurant however because of the customer service I will never  there again everything has went down about this restaurant and if they don't get better with the and customer service people will notice and people will stop coming to this place I know I'm one customer that will not return.  I dont think the owner even cares"}
{"text":"This place is THE BOMB. HANDS DOWN. IF you haven't eaten here you DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE MISSING."}
{"text":"The foods good.  The customer service tonight was everything wrong with black owned business. There's a blizzard in Cleveland tonight. 12-9-16. I go inside and there are 2 fat women behind the glass. One pleasant,  the other on the phone having a personal conversation.  She's smiling and her conversation and response to the caller confirm that her conversation was personal. All the while I wait for eye contact or some sort of acknowledgement and she intentionally avoids inter actions with me and the other customers waiting to have their orders taking. None of the other employees in the store say anything. The employees in the back are doing what they do and the chick on the phone continues her conversation not caring about the customers who came in on a blizzard to eat Open Pit. If the owner is reading, the fat one with the braids going up in a pony tail is hurting your business.  Customer svc should be important.  Even in the hood. She proved everything they say about 'Black Business '. When she finally took my order which was 3 pieces of cake I paid. She didn't even say thank you.  I'm gonna stay away from your establishment for a while and when I'm asked 'Who has good bbq I will recommend any place else but Open Pit. You can thank the fat girl with braids on this snowy night for loosing a customer. I encourage anyone else whose had a similar experience to stay away until their customer service gets corrected."}
{"text":"I went there on the 4of July and they have worst customer service ever the chicken I got old and those ghetto chicks that work there have bad attitudes never will i go there again."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ, wings are hot and crispy. I like sauce on the side! Good polish boy, I've also had the pork chops very good and they cook to order!!! Just be patient when you go weekends are packed but service is fast. Well worth the drive to da hood.. This place is soo much better than b & m and hot sauce williams COMBINED!!!"}
{"text":"It's been over a month since the owner claimed that he would remake my meal which was absolutely horrendous. My rating remains at a 1, because of the lack of customer service and inability to follow through."}
{"text":"Pro: Food is ALWAYS GREAT; Parking lot and street parking; Best to call ahead; TouchTunes onsite for those who have to wait Con: When placing a phone order, hold time is always long; When trying to place an order over the phone line may be busy"}
{"text":"I had wings w/sauce, mac and cheese,greens, cornbread and yellow cake with chocolate icing. Everything was ok. The wings are like Chinese style wings. The sauce was good. It was a sweeter sauce than Hot Sauce Williams. The sides were ok. The cornbread was dry and the cake was nasty. I will not eat here again. However, the customer service was amazing."}
{"text":"I've been eating from this spot since I was born!! It has the best polish boys, wings, fish, and rib tips. Basically order anything and you will be satisfied. The they have now compared to recent years is much more courteous and professional.   Two quick tips: always call your order in cause it will take 20-30 minutes and second try not to go late night by yourself. It's in a rough neighborhood."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken Breast sandwich w/ fires and waited over an half an hour while I watch every other customer come n go. This is my last time coming here."}
{"text":"The food is so good but do not try to put a order in over the phone they will mess it up or won't answer the phone"}
{"text":"Fantastic food best bar b in the world!!!!!    I love the sauce and the service is awesome..... I can eat here 7 days a week.    It's worth every penny"}
{"text":"I ordered the 5 wings with fries and coleslaw and it was amazing! The wait was 30 mins but everything was very fresh & hot so totally worth it. The sauce was very tasty. The lady that rang me out was pleasant and sweet; I asked several questions and she made sure she answered them all regardless of how busy it was. I appreciate amazing customer service like that!   If you have never been here, I recommend this place!! It's a small place but VERY good!"}
{"text":"Now that's what I'm taking about! So, I bought my usual and had my Polish boys, fries and wings... and someone must have read what I wrote because these wings was soooooooo good! OMG, yes, yes, yes! Thank you! The wings had extra sauce on them!!!! What??!!!! Talk about being surprised! And they had the nerve enough to be fresh. Well ain't that some shit? LOL! Someone must have had a good day because these wings where Bomb! Keep his ass in the kitchen :) Until next time...  ** Before I could finish this review I went back to Open Pitt and it was still good for the second time!! Talk about being shocked. Today is January 1st and if you are reading this and have want some good dripping saucy wings go now before it's too late!!! Wings and Po'boys all day! Yum!"}
{"text":"These people are rude as hell. The only business I know that answers the phone and hang up on you! Or they just leave on hold forever. The only reason they get 3 stars is the food is good."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get BBQ in Cleveland. The SIZZAUCE is...fantastic. Really incredible. Layered and the perfect combination of tangy/spicy/sweet. I analyzed the sauce a few nights ago while sopping it up with white bread. (One of the only times I am willing to eat white bread is with this sauce.)  The Polish Boys and wings are great here. I ask for my wings fried in flour as opposed to batter. A request they get often and execute quickly and well.  But my favorite thing to order here is the Center Rib Dinner, sauce on the side. If you can get some ribs from here FRESH, they are out of this world. If they're not so fresh, then not so much (but that's the case anywhere). I would just ask before ordering.  The macaroni and cheese must also be mentioned. I'm not a big mac fan, but have tasted it and recall it being memorable. And a friend of mine raves about it.  Also, this spot is almost always open. My most recent visit was post-clubbing at around 3 am! And they honor call-ahead orders when there are other nearby BBQ spots--AHEM B&M-- that will not."}
{"text":"Best dam bbque in the inner city wait is sometimes unavoidable but the food is great my favorite is the rib tips and the cakes . Try the sides ."}
{"text":"I LOVE this Barbecue!  I use it for catering on photo shoots. First time i was told to pull around to the back door. As I pulled in I saw the smokers lined up behind the building.  Amazing! Just not in the best part of town. HIGHLY recommend. Call for carry out. No place to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Great Bar-b-que at a value price. The sides of potato salad and baked beans are just as satisfying,"}
{"text":"I love the fried catfish and the sauce on the wings is so good !! I'm not from Ohio but this is one of my favorite places to eat .."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Customer service is shit. Ghetto establishment with ghetto workers. The females that work there have terrible attitudes. Yelling through the phone, getting mad when a customer asks a question about an order. Smacking lips. Totally unprofessional."}
