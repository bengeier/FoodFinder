{"text":"Nice Ambiance. Chef/owner is generous with sending tasting treats to the table between courses. Being a vegetarian, I did not get to taste them because they mostly (except the sorbet) contained some form of animal in them. 
Okay service, nothing special. 
I gave the restaurant 3 stars because there is no option for 2.5 stars and it is not vegetarian friendly. I based my review by tasting 2 salads which were also okay, but nothing to rave about. 
In general I find the place overpriced. Torontonians are very fortunate to have so many other options with better value. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It is family run. I have been three times all with different people. Everything we have ordered is delish. Great service, great food and nice touches to make you feel at home and wanting to come back."}
{"text":"We had the beet and goat cheese salad which was really good. The fruitti de mare was amazing. They didn't have cheese tray on the menu  but made one specially for us. Wait staff were friendly, attentive and accommodating. Family owned business and I loved the idea of supporting their dreams. So much fun."}
{"text":"This family-owned restaurant brings a cozy feel and the warm goodness of a home cooked meal. If you're expecting the fancy stylings and flavours of an upscale restaurant, you may leave a bit disappointed. But if you're looking for good food, you'll enjoy 12 Tables. 

We had:
- Baked eggplant appetizer: Fresh taste, though would have liked a bit more cheese
- Prosciutto and fig salad: Generous serving, with clumps of prosciutto and figs
- Beef tenderloin pasta with creamy truffle sauce: Meh. Ok for a creamy pasta but would have loved more if the truffle flavour and the beef was not as tender as I wanted 
- Frutti di Mare: Really generous serving of seafood to go with a nice tomato sauce
- Duck: The absolute star of the show. I don't know how to give this justice but the flavours and cook was just spot on
- Pavlova dessert: Generous serving (are you sensing a theme? good for two) and not overly sweet (which was great)
- Chocolate lava souffle: Gooey and oozing, just how it should be

In addition, servers were very attentive and had a friendly (but not overly familiar or intrusive) vibe. And to top off the meal, they gave us a shot of Polish vodka and Italian limoncello for free - yum!

While it definitely is on the pricier side (especially for food that has more of a home cooked feel), I'd still recommend 12 Tables. I hope this neighbourhood gem continues to flourish!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food - everything made fresh, brilliant flavours. Especially loved the charcuterie plate and the pasta dishes. This restaurant is family owner and operated. The exceptional warmth and hospitality is an excellent addition to the terrific food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went last week with friends and had a spectacular time. The duck is the best I've ever tasted. The people are friendly, the service is excellent. I'm definitely coming back."}
