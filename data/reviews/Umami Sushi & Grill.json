{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have never dined in and take my sushi to go but I'm sure you can't lose either way. The people are super friendly, the sushi is succulent (a funny word but it's true). They don't cut the sushi in gigantic pieces, so you can't chew or swallow. Their traditional sushi is almost bite sized and yet somehow it's still filled with soft, yummy ingredients. Their specials are bigger but not obnoxiously big. The Unami roll is one of my favorites. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get takeout a few nights ago. This is a great little new spot and the hibachi dishes were good and reasonably priced. They even come with soup and salad which many other places charge extra for. I havent tried the sushi but probably will at some point."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night and the place was very quiet (one table). But I know it is pretty new so I was still hoping for the best. I ordered three dinners to go. My chicken tempura was placed on the counter way before the teriyaki chicken and hibachi beef was ready, and it seemed like it was forgotten there. The hostess did then inform me that the chef had failed to notice the beef dish so I would have to wait a bit longer for the whole order. By the time I got home the tempura was ice cold and and not crispy at all. The other two dishes were ok but not anything to rave about. The place itself was clean and the staff was very friendly, I will probably give it another try but for now I was not all that impressed."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the quality and quantity of food. I ordered the hibachi beef and chicken. The service was great and the price as well. I will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"So. Good. The food was wonderful. The service spot on. We had sushi and hibacci and once we realized how good it was we ordered a sushi roll to take home for our son. It's great to have another yummy option in Matthews. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Charlotte area without a doubt.
Extremely fresh fish and great selection of rolls.
I highly recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this amazing restaurant. Very friendly people and pleasant music. They have an all you can eat sushi deal for $19.99. That is insane, and amazing! I literally got 6 rolls and they were all incredible and 6+ pieces per roll. If you love sushi, go here! Spread the word. :) This place needs more recognition, they rock!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a gem. Quality sushi and all you can eat for 20 bucks so come hungry. I'm a big fella too so you best believe I got my money's worth outa this place! Some of the best customer service Iv had in a while. Even with me and my lady coming in a hour before close they were nice and friendly. Thinking about coming back for my birthday next month. Regardless, I will deffinitely be making this one of my new spots for good sushi, just awesome!"}
{"text":"I wanted to wait till I have a few visits under my belt to write a review. 
Umami has become my new favorite when it comes to sushi. If you love sushi the first thing you should order is the Matthews roll. It's over the top delicious. It's sweet and spicy. My favorite roll of all time. Not a fan of spicy? Try the Pop pop girl. It's got cucumber to cool off the palate. 
Even the hibachi is on point and our little one loves the Miso soup. 
My only complaint would be I wish I could eat more when I go but for all-you-can eat at $19.99 your first order will almost exceed that price. 
Love sushi? Don't love sushi but like hibachi? Give it a try. 
Just save the Matthew rolls for me."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!! Fantastic service, great prices, especially the all you can eat sushi (which includes apps, salad, soup, etc) which is always very fresh and delicious! Small scale family owned restaurant with great friendly atmosphere. We have been 5 times now and have not been disappointed! : )"}
{"text":"$20 all you can eat sushi?  Oh yeah!  It is made to order too (not sitting on a buffet all day).  Service was fast and friendly.  Tasty fish, great preparation and presentation.  Only downside: no alcohol."}
{"text":"My sister, mom and I stopped in to try it (mom and I Hurricane Irma evacuees , sister just moved here a month ago) and the food was excellent. The prices were very cost effective. We enjoyed our sushi and the service was excellent. The restaurant was very clean and eating utensils were very polished. Not my FL sushi bar i go to every Saturday but i loved it and i will def be back when i come ti visit."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! The servers are attentive and the food is consistently good. 
I also love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We stopped in for late dinner to kill our sushi cravings on a Tuesday night. Having just moved here from out of state, we were a little nervous about the quality of the sushi, but were pleasantly surprised! Our orders came out quickly, and the service was pretty good. The best part was that they didn't stuff the rolls with a ton of filler rice! Instead, the rolls were meaty and full of flavor. We will be back on our next sushi craving :)"}
{"text":"I forgot to do this the day I went her but I love sushi but not at 25$ for 4 roll like gtfo of here with that bs bye Felicia I'll keep going to the other sushi place in Matthews for less cause your prices way to high you need to cut it"}
{"text":"This is the BEST sushi I've ever had. Price is right, food is perfect. Simple, delicious. Just can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"Love it here. We have been at least 10 times. Thankfully now serving beer and wine. It's a remodeled KFC so please don't go for the the venue but the staff and food are wonderful. My family goes for the hibachi but I enjoy the sushi. 10 out of 10 visits have been good to great. Great addition to Matthews."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, $19.99 all you can eat sushi was delicious. 
Best in town, will tell others about this place and will visit again."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly staff. Sushi tasted fresh, spicy seaweed salad was great but not spicy, vegetable tempura was good and teriyaki chicken was flavorful. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really excellent sushi.   Had about 5 rolls and 5 pieces of sushi.  All were great.  $20.   Wow. We will definitely come back.  Nice people, too."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Seriously, I've been to so many different sushi places and this is by far the best. They don't have a license to sell alcohol yet but they are working on it and you can still byob. The Matthews Roll is a must have! 5 stars is an understatement!"}
{"text":"We LOVE sushi and Umami was awesome! Super fresh seafood, fast service, and very nice restaurant! The prices were very reasonable also, I got hibachi shrimp, the rainbow roll, and 3 pieces of red snapper. They have a all you can eat deal for $19 so I'll definitely be back for that!"}
{"text":"Sushi was very very bad. We ordered the Black Tiger and Spicy Tina rolls. It tasted like it had been sitting out all day. Could not finish it. Was sick for days after"}
{"text":"Great food and sushi and a great atmosphere too. 

Our waitress was attentive as she would come and check up on us often. 

The food came out in orderly fashion. We had lots of appetizers that were all good and actually came out first. 

Three of us had all you can eat sushi which was more than we could finish but we tried very hard not to be wasteful. My parents and an aunt had food from the menu which was tasty too. 

I think this place just opened not too long ago too. The only thing I would say is the rice is a bit excessive but as long as you try to finish you won't get any glares. Lol."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi! Very good selection. It's 20 bucks per person for all you can eat. Small. Quiant. Clean."}
{"text":"What could I say I keep on coming back.
That should say enough 
They have great Deal $19.99 all you eat
They do have a special menu for this deal
You can't bet it.
Family owned and operated.
The Mrs is always out front making sure everything is just so.
And always so clean.
This place you must come..."}
{"text":"I came with my boyfriend and we got all you can eat. It's a little weird because you get charged 50 cents per piece you can't finish. I have been to Pisces and other places where as long as you order reasonable amounts one or two pieces does not matter. Quality was good for all you can eat and there were a lot of options for appetizers. The sushi roll options were limited and mostly fried. I would recommend for price but not for selection."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! This place even has a drive thru so when I'm on my lunch break I don't have to walk in."}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant, all you can eat sushi was very good and a great deal.  Good service.  And was pretty busy  even on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Ok so I came for the all you can eat sushi for $20 and that was amazing.  Their rolls are fresh and fantastic.  However, little did I know that they have some of the best hibachi I've ever had anywhere.  Let me tell you, the $20 AYCE sushi is a great deal and very hard to pass up, but their hibachi may be worth it."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place already! Ive been here twice to dine in and also gotten take out twice. This place is brand new and the first couple of times i went in it was clear they were still figuring things out. However, there are clear improvements each time ive been here. The staff and owner are extremely friendly and accommodating. And the food is FANTASTIC. All you can eat sushi for $20 - you can beat that! (Also, kids get the full all you can eat sushi menu for $7!) I honestly cant say enough positive things about these guys!"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Japanese Sushi and Grill places that being said Umami is definitely one of the best. I have driven past it several times and thought about stopping and after I read the reviews online I decided I definitely had to give it a try. I started with the Gyoza or fried dumplings they were good, but the dipping sauce they came with was a little Bland, I then ordered the Hibachi chicken and beef, which comes with salad and soup you are supposed to get miso soup but they allowed me to change it out for the onion. it also comes with mixed vegetables for $11.95, I'm not sure what the sauces they use on the meat, but it is absolutely delicious when the plant first came I tried the rice and thought it's very Bland but then when I realized how delicious the meat was with the sauce and mix the two together, oh my goodness that was the bomb. if you happen to be around Matthews and you're in the mood for Japanese stop by Umami you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get sushi in the area. They have a really awesome selection and they aren't too expensive! I've tried individual rolls and done the endless sushi. I thought both were really good! We've gotten hibachi from them a few times and haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"The staff are all very nice.  The food is good - I can only speak for the hibachi as we have not had sushi here.  The hibachi and teryaki entrees come with miso soup and salad, fried rice, and vegetables.  The fried rice is good.  The teryaki chicken is good as well although I do wish the chicken wasn't so thin.  We frequently get take out from here and have never had any issues."}
{"text":"Was a very good lunch. Fresh sushi, not like some places I've been. Great server. Not Super expensive, well worth it!!! And they have an all you can eat menu for $20. Will be back one night for dinner for sure. Almost forgot the excellent Miso soup and salad, make sure you get it with the ginger dressing!!!"}
{"text":"Sad experience this weekend when attempting to go to dinner. It was a Saturday night around 6:15 with several tables set and empty at the restaurant. A group of two walked in directly in front of our group of three. We were all generally greeted within about  30 seconds - great!

The group of two was seated within about a minute while our group continued to stand at the entrance...waiting to be sat. Several servers and what appeared to be hosts continued to walk by us. After an additional five minutes of no one greeting us, asking if we've been helped or any other dialogue, we left. 

This was truly sad as I'd just explained to my group before arriving at the restaurant how nice the place is and how friendly the staff had been. 

Unfortunately with several other nice sushi places nearby, I will think twice before returning to Umami."}
{"text":"Excellent! Very happy with our first trip here.  We had different kinds of hibachi and the all you can eat sushi. Everything was very fresh and made with an attention to detail. Even the sauces tasted fresh and delicious. The gyoza appetizers were some of the best we have had. The family that owns this restaurant is very nice. They made us feel welcome and were very attentive throughout dinner.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We did the all you can eat sushi dinner, and we really enjoyed the sushi! The rolls were very tasty, and the sushi itself was very fresh. The only complaint that I had was that the sushi came out at a very slow rate; we had to wait a long time for our second round of sushi. But overall great quality sushi!"}
{"text":"Great little spot to get some sushi or a little hibachi. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food was good, definitely not the best sushi I have had. But what else can you expect when you get all you can eat sushi. We will be coming back. The one thing that surprised me was the small size of the appetizers, but that is not a problem because you can order more or you can try various appetizers. Sorry I did not take a picture of the all you can eat menu, it has changed slightly since the last photos were loaded."}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favor and try this place out.  It isn't your standard all you can eat sushi that is mediocre.  It is very well prepared and it is EXCELLENT quality.  We are sushi connoisseurs and I will say that this is the best place in Charlotte for this type of meal.  The staff is extremely friendly and they allow you to BYOB until they get their liquor license as they are a new restaurant.  It's worth the drive to Matthews."}
{"text":"The all you can eat sushi is a great deal you get to pick the sushi you want. For only 20$ it doesn't look good from outside but don't judge a book by its cover the food is simply amazing."}
{"text":"So glad this place is open! Great non-greasy hibachi. Tons of food for the price. Love it."}
{"text":"The sushi is mediocre - nothing special, I would spend my money elsewhere. I had a bad experience the other day when the restaurant was completely empty and the waitress was extremely rude and didn't bring me some of the items I ordered."}
{"text":"Umami was good. I called in an order for beef hibachi and an order of spring rolls. Grand total: $15. My husband, daughter and I split the order and had plenty of food. The  miso is good. The meals come with soup, salad, veggies, rice and sauces. It's a deal that can't be beat."}
{"text":"The food was just okay but the service was great. Plus the price is good for the lunch menu if you find that you enjoy the food. I had the umami roll, California roll, soup and salad for $10. The salad is iceberg lettuce with a sort of ginger dressing already on it. I didn't care for it but it was no big deal. The umami roll was ok but the California roll was pretty bad. Once again, the service was great so no big deal, but I probably would not go again."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good spot for sushi. Their sushi was really really good and tasted very fresh. I wasn't too impressed with the miso sour or the ginger salad, but amazing prices on their sushi lunch specials"}
{"text":"I've had the Tuna Poke bowl, and Umami Burrito. Both were delicious! The burrito was extremely flavorful with the Umami sauce. Chris suggested the Shishito Peppers as a side and it was a perfect meal! 


This is going to be my new spot!  Now I can get my \"Poke fix\" without daydreaming about going to California just for a Poke bowl or burrito:) 

Thanks for the excellent customer service and honest recommendations Chris!"}
{"text":"This sushi is fantastic, fresh, and reasonably priced. It doesn't look like much from the outside but you'll be glad you stopped in!!"}
{"text":"This was a late night stop for sushi after a long day. 
We were greeted by smiling, friendly faces at every turn. Service was spot on and the food was great.  We tried the hibachi chicken and the portion was insane. The all you can eat sushi for $19.99 was way more than I could eat!  The only thing was the sushi was a bit more warm than I cared for.  Otherwise, this is a clean, quick place for great food and great service."}
{"text":"Great sushi in Matthews! Nice atmosphere, love the dim lighting!! Great  very friendly service and the food is excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and all you can eat sushi! I had the teriyaki chicken w/ fried rice. Very good and the shrimp sauce is the best I have had. Legit. Wife had the sushi. Nothing but good things from her. Favorites were the Matthews roll and Crunchy Shrimp roll. I will definitely try the sushi in the near future. Also, service was quick and friendly. Check them out. I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am from out of state and was here on business. I am alway looking for a great sushi place. Let me tell you. This place is AMAZING. At first from the outside I was thinking otherwise but inside it's a lot different.

The sushi was fresh. And the service here was great. For $20 all you can eat.... I would be willing to pay 2X that. What a great find."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, awesome sushi and lots to choose from! I requested my sushi rolled in cucumber and even though it took a bit longer, they were willing to accommodate me. So thankful! I enjoyed every bite and will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but my10 year old son got the all you can eat sushi for his birthday and didn't eat one ball of rice then ordered one more round the owner preceded to come out and tell us how we were being wasteful and wasting the cooks time because he didn't eat the rice under one of his pieces of sushi. Like I said food was great but the owner is an asshole."}
{"text":"The miso soup is good. Typical soup. 

Dressing for the ginger salad is very pleasant. It's creamy and the ginger isn't so much to where it's overwhelming like other Japanese restaurants around the area.

Vegetables entree is decent. I wished there were more mushrooms and if it had sweet carrots. The entree consisted of mostly broccoli, onion, green bell pepper, and mushroom.

A thing I wished they offered are sweet carrots. I love that they offer miso and salad with the entrees even when you have your order to go. 

The sushi is one point. My husband who didn't like sushi became quiet the fan of Umami's. I would recommend teriyaki menu items as the sauce isn't too sweet. Habachi is great as well."}
{"text":"Very quick and friendly service! The sushi is very reasonably priced--- I got 3 rolls for $12. My sister ordered 2 rolls + sashimi. The sushi is very tasty and I love how it comes with soup and salad with no extra charge. The interior of the place is very modern and nicely done. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great little spot in Matthews! Sushi is always fresh and plentiful. Can't beat the all you can eat sushi menu and prices!"}
{"text":"Had this place twice already, I will say the customer service is always great. I ordered the hibachi beef (9.95) Spider roll(7.50), California roll (4.50) spicy tuna roll(4.95)and a regular tuna roll(4.95). Let's be honest, it's your typical Japanese style restaurant. It's a place where \"you get what you pay for.\" I must say though -- the potions were surprisingly big and you also receive a miso soup and ginger salad. 
They do offer all you can eat sushi for $19.99 (kids 3-6 $6.99 Kids 7-10 $11.99) 
I do like the sushi bar they have, the decorations are Asian inspired. A sitting area while you wait for your take-out and a casual dining area.
For the affordable prices that they offer I will continue to go here, but if you're looking for a not so plain/rainbows out of your rice Japanese meal, spend the extra bucks, skip this spot and see the other options."}
{"text":"We tried this for lunch all you can eat sushi. Very fresh and tasty, okay price for a great concept! I recommend."}
{"text":"California roll-yum. Crunchy shrimp roll-yum, yum. I love the ginger as well as the Wasabi.  The spring roll was not greasy, hot and wonderfully flavorful. I also had a salad with a wonderful ginger dressing. The teriyaki shrimp was glorious. Lot of flavor in the shrimp and fresh vegetables. The rice was perfectly steamed. I love this place"}
{"text":"$19.99 AYCE. It's worth it, trust me. Unless you can only eat 2 rolls, in that case... who are you?? I wish that were me. I don't do all-you-can-eat sushi often because then I have to order and eat as much as possible to get my money's worth. I usually end up semi-regretting it. From the appetizers, I recommend the seaweed salad and calamari. Ordered a few rolls and enjoyed all of them. I like that they don't coat the rolls with too much rice so that you're just being filled up with rice. Do note that sometimes if you order many rolls, like more than 5, they will give you 2 pieces of each type of roll, maybe to save space for more? Someone who ordered more sushi than me ended up with almost the same quantity. I kinda wish they didn't do that because I know what I'm getting myself into and don't want to have to order another round after the first. Anyway, the service is prompt and friendly so I'll definitely come back if in the area."}
{"text":"First visit today. Good and fresh sushi. I was pleasantly surprised at the great value for the delicious selection. The service was good and everyone was so polite. The building is an old KFC or other fast food place, but there is a treat hidden inside. I recommend the food and will be back."}
{"text":"Don't let the converted fast food stand alone run you away. No it's not fancy but the food is good. Very fresh sushi, great miso soup, goza and seaweed salad. Have an all you can eat sushi menu  as well as a regular hibachi menu. 

Parking lot, casual and family oriented."}
{"text":"We have been there when they first opened and found it to be ok, nothing fabulous but ok. I have not been since February . My Nephew(14) had heard about it at school and wanted me to take him, so off we went to eat sushi. We went at lunch time and ordered from the 19.99 all you can eat menu.
We had.
Edamame
Tempura Calamari & Shrimp..Both of these were frozen pre-made commercial products 
Seaweed Salad..Which for some reason they doused in spicy mayonnaise 

We ordered some rolls from the regular roll section and they came out. they were very loose, some couldn't even be picked up with chopsticks without falling apart.They don't use sticky sushi rice, but some other sort of non clumping harder rice. I would imagine this is used to accommodate the fried rice menu

We ordered a second round of rolls from the special rolls. 
They came out again way over dressed with mayonnaise and various sauces. One thing that was missing was the actual crab from the fried crab roll, salmon skin was barely noticeable, the double spicy roll was just gooey on top , so much mayo inside that it was dripping and again they were all falling apart.

We ate what we could pull out of them and left the rest. This is when our MIA waitress appeared and told us if we didn't eat it we had to pay a surcharge , To me the best part of sushi is it is some what Healthy, when it's dripping with nasty mayonnaise it is not .Then the owner came over and yelled at us and told us we had to eat it or pay extra. I had been holding my tongue and didn't tell the waitress we didn't eat it because it was gross.

Now the owner ( which another reviewer called an asshole ) came and yelled at us, I tried to explain we found it pretty nasty and had we eaten it I would have vomited . He didn't care he yelled he made it this morning and it was good. He brought us the check with a 15.00 surcharge, our crappy all you can eat 19.99 lunch totaled at 63.47. For this we could have gone to a REAL SUSHI place. While  I usually use my debit card I charged this so I can contest the surcharge. 

Summation If you want quantity over quality please go but if you want to be treated with respect, eat good food stay away"}
{"text":"First things first we came in to this tiny hole in the wall not expecting much. We were greeted by am extremely friendly staff who explained pur options well. My inlaws ordered the teriyaki chicke and my family ordered sushi. All of the food was very fresh and exceptionally tasty. Dine here with comfidence that you will have a good meal."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have great quality sushi for a fair price. The people and servers are always friendly and welcoming. It truly is the best sushi in town."}
{"text":"Don't let looks fool you, although an old fast food building the food was great! Friday night, full house but no wait, service was great, food was a little slow but nothing to complain about. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wife, Kids and I went for lunch on Jan 2.  We had sushi and hibachi.  Everything was excellent.  Server was prompt, polite, and brought my oldest easy chopsticks without us having to ask.  The food was delicious, portions large for lunch, and well priced.  Dinning area was clean, spacious and well decorated.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We have been there twice so far and love it! Had the $19.99 all you can eat sushi and apps. They have a great selection of food. They are doing a soft opening so be patient. The staff is friendly and food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh sushi. The prices are reasonable, and of course the all you can eat is fun too. 

I love their lunch specials - sushi and hibachi. They're all fantastic! 

I'll be going back for more!"}
{"text":"5 stars all day long. Listen. My wife come here every Sunday night. He have lived tons of places. New York. Chicago. New Jersey. You name it. We first joked coming here because it's like an old kfc turned it a sushi restaurant. But the waitstaff is amazing. We always have Val as a server and she so friendly and attentive. We do the all you can eat deal for $20 and destroy it. Majority of the time when other restaurant do all you can eat they add a ton of rice so you get full quicker and use fake items. Not here everything is spot on. Hope you try it out and we will see you on Sunday!!!"}
{"text":"The heat wasn't working the evening I went for dinner (which in sure is fixed now) but the sushi was delicious! Everything tasted so fresh and had great flavor! Someone else with me had a hibachi chicken and shrimp plate which was also very tasty. Will definitely be back again and would absolutely recommend this restaurant to others!"}
{"text":"The $19.99 all you can sushi is such a deal for the quality of food you get. The Crunchy Shrimp roll is outstanding and great Miso soup."}
{"text":"The $20 ayce sushi option is the real deal. Very fresh, excellent. Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you! Very friendly service, clean inside and very good sushi. Fish is all fresh and their tempura is good. So attentive and fast. This is way better than the AYCE sushi place on Pineville-matthews road. Will definitely be back. Didn't have anything from the grill- will have to try that next time."}
{"text":"This review is not for the buffet. We just ordered regular menu but I would give 4stars for the all-you-can-eat buffet just paying $19.99. The roll I ordered was dragon roll and yes, the ingredients were fresh. But the portion of eel was so disappointing. You can hardly find eel, mainly cucumbers! (As you can see in the photo) Also they forgot adding masago on the top. 

If I had this roll as one of the rolls for the buffet, I wouldn't complain but it was not good enough for regular priced roll. We talked the server and they were kind enough to change the roll. Another dish, teriyaki beef and shrimp was good. I can tell they use fresh ingredients. This place is good for the buffet but I will probably not order rolls for the regular price next time."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday lunch .. we ordered if the all you can eat sushi menu... their sushi is a joke .. I mean a joke .. you'll get better sushi at buffet ..  the only thing was good of the menu was the miso soup ... the service was friendly and fast .. but  food was bland and tasteless. I'm going 2 stars because the friendly service .. I feel like people who left them good reviews where either paid or family ...  there are way way better places for all you can eat sushi ... this is not one of them ........"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for $19.99 is perfect for anyone who loves fresh served to order sushi. It has a variety of appetizer options too. The miso soup is delicious! Come hungry, you will not be disappointed! For an extra charge, order the temporal ice cream, its a perfect ending to a great all you can eat sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food. I had the chicken and shrimp hibachi meal. The hibachi plate was cooked perfectly and the seasonings were were spot on. The miso soup and salad were also flavorful. I would have liked a larger portion size for the meat as it seemed more like a lunch portion than a dinner portion. 

My dining partner had sushi. The rolls were beautifully presented, large, and well priced.  He was happy with his meal and very full after eating two rolls. 

Unfortunately, they do not serve alcohol. I was hoping for plum wine, but no such luck. The lack of alcohol will probably keep this from being a true date night place, but we'll definitely be back for lunch. 

We were impressed with the friendly staff and clean restaurant. The dining area is pretty and pleasant with lots of space. This is a much needed addition to the Matthews dining scene.

Edited to change to 5 stars, as we've eaten here 3 times in 10 days. Excellent food!"}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat sushi, made to order. Sure, there's a regular menu but if you're looking to stuff yourself silly with raw fish, the printed list is the way to go.

We got a couple hot items to start with - gyoza and such - and then a couple of huge plates of sushi. Tamago, eel, california roll, an Umami roll, spicy tuna, all that and more.

Service was great. No faces when we ordered more. No funny looks when we cleared one plate and got another plate. Woot.

Fish quality was good and the flavor was on. Definitely would return to Umami."}
{"text":"the grilled shrimp was cooked perfectly the sushi was fresh and tasty   service was well timed"}
{"text":"Closer to 3.5 than a full 4. Very friendly service and what seems to be a good deal for all you can eat, but an emphasis on fried options and standard rolls priced a bit above the quality of the fish.But pretty good for a fast sushi experience. They maybe just need to push in one direction or the other. Lower prices a bit for individual rolls or up the fish quality. I'll give it another shot though!"}
{"text":"This is probably my new sushi buffet restaurant. The waiters/waitresses are friendly, atmosphere is quiet and nice, and food to sushi ratio is amazing!! Would definitely recommend to my friends and family! Definitely would recommend the spider roll, it's great! Sushi doesn't take too long to come out as long as you order as you eat. Price is only $19.99 per person so it's pretty affordable!"}
{"text":"Great choice if you like all you can eat meals. My date and I did not have AYCE this trip because he didn't want sushi and I wanted to try a roll that wasn't on the AYCE menu. The portions are typical of what many AYCE places serve. I enjoyed the sushi, and ate all 3 rolls by myself. I would return when I'm in the mood for a great sushi deal. But for a regular sushi night, I would go elsewhere."}
