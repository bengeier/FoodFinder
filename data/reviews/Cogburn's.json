{"text":"Don't waste your time. Snotty waitress and mgr just as bad."}
{"text":"Opened pretty good, food is the same as the power store, perfect. Glad it's in my hood. 10 times better than the previous restaurant. Chicks are hotter than the suicide sauce!"}
{"text":"Tried this location to satisfy my wing craving last night. Pretty awesome special on on cheeseburgers for Mondays hut I stuck to the wings. Nice big wings, cooked well (approaching overcooked but not quite there) with a good sauce. Pricing is very reasonable and the \"big\" beers are actually big unlike most places. Service was good on my visit. Minus one star for being able to clearly see one of the other the server's buttcheeks under tiny \"shorts\"....just no."}
{"text":"Excellent service, cold beer, and great wings, what more do you need? Very cool bar with food that's much better than typical \"bar food\". Great place wether you're looking for a bar to go watch sports and drink, but also a great place to bring the family for a meal. I would highly recommend! Our service was Molly and she was excellent."}
{"text":"This is the worst place. I wouldn't even go back to use the bathroom. The worst service.  Mediocre food if they can get it to you before it's cold. Enter at own risk"}
{"text":"My husband introduced me to Cogburn's GRILLED wings a few years back from one of their other locations and they were phenomenal! We tried this new location since it's down the street from his office and they're just as great...grilled garlic parmesan are my favorite.  It was fairly full, very clean, and service was good...we got seated immediately and drink orders taken within a few minutes. I know others mentioned the service was lacking and while we didn't have issues, I realize that it can take a bit to work out the kinks at a new establishment. I would definitely recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Another sports bar where I am ignored. However this time there was no one else there. Also how does a sports bar have bad ESPN reception?  Seems like that should be THE channel that always works.  3 stars because I did like the food.  Good southwest chicken wrap.  Good nachos, made with real cheese.  So I guess if I want to go to a sports bar, eat decent food, and be left alone then I will be back."}
{"text":"Ken is the owner of all three. His taste in music is bad, so you'll have to suffer with 1940's hillbilly banjo music he apparently thinks is country? I like country...Willie Nelson, George Strait, etc. Not that stuff. That was in the day last week. Then at night recently they overserved a guy who thought it was ok (since he could barely sit on a barstool) to lean all over me. No. Not ok. They know now that I would not accept that as a paying, polite, patron of the place. I've now been kicked out because I got loud about drunk dude. All three? What a wimpy, stupid place to drink a beer and eat wings. The watresses are sexy! And know it! Bye strange acting bar. Dirty Blonde Tavern.....A REAL bar"}
{"text":"Greay food. Great service. Try the Cowboy Chipotle Pasta. Amazing! Kendall is a gem and is one of the best bartenders ever. Nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. First of all, the addition of the wall was a big mistake, it closes off the whole restaurant! Secondly, the food is gross. Our plates were dirty (literally had to wipe them off with a wet nap) and that was the small problem. The wings were actually salty. So salty that I thought I was pouring salt directly into my mouth, mixed with artificial butter. I don't know about you, but that doesn't exactly say \"medium\" to me. The pizza was limp and greasy, and the beer was Mildly cool. I suggest you save your money and swing into the fry's across the street and pick up some *better quality* frozen food and drinks."}
{"text":"So this is a new spot for us here Gilbert, been to the location on ValVista and the service was ok, the food was good too, so we decided to give the new location a try... in a word, TERRIBLE. The food was good and the service was ok, but there is no management at this place, they are allowing vapes/e-cigs at the bar,  hardcore profanity laden gangster rap and even having the wait staff play and turn up another profanity laden song all the while singing it so anyone could hear... so in all, of you like your chicken wings with vapes and gangster rap, well this is your place. I may be conservative, but this was ridiculous,  no thanks Cogburns, you have enough of my money,  you don't get anymore."}
{"text":"First visit to this location and it was a nightmare from the start but because we love the other locations we decided to stick around. It took over 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge that we had not been helped, the only reason someone finally came was because the hostess went and grabbed someone. Once the waitress came she was real short with us, definitely needed some customer service training. My husband ordered 10 wings and she brought out 5 and didnt realize anything was wrong. She then went back and had them make him 5 more, when she returned she said at least these ones are fresh. As my husband begins to eat the first batch he quickly discovers they are not cooked all the way in which I had to have the hostess find our waitress. When our waitress returns she asks us what we want to do, as we look at her blankly she says she will have them make more. At that point we told her we will take the check. At no point did she ever apologize and there was no manager around. We will never be going back and definitely spreading the word."}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice, over all great service from our waitress. Waited a couple minutes before the hostess greeted us at the door. Ordered wings/turkey burger/beers. Wings were large and fresh. Loved the selection of flavors for wings. Cinnamon and sugar, peanut butter/jelly.. interesting! As for the burger..obviously frozen and thin. Picked off most of the over buttered bun. I rarely order a burger so I was super disappointed. Tip: stick to the wings!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat there. 4 of us stood up front for a minute and no one greeted us so we sat down ourselves. Waited another 5min or so and still didn't even see anyone walking around the one table they had at the time. I went and got the family menus while I started looking for somewhere else to eat. We left a few mins later and didn't see anyone waiting on tables, even the only one in there. Didn't look like we'd get any better service."}
{"text":"Despite breaking up a brawl staff was great food was good and hopefully the trash filters out"}
{"text":"Had early dinner on Monday-  burgers were awesome. First time at this restaurant/bar for us and we will return.  Service was great- we will be back. Looks like it could be a great time little later in the evening for dinner and drinks"}
{"text":"Was going to try this place for the first time. We arrived and waited to be seated.  Two servers looked at us twice and didn't say a word. We waited another five minutes and left.  There was probably five people in the restaurant.  They were not too busy to seat a party of four.  Also not too busy to acknowledge a person waiting to be seated.  Not going there again."}
{"text":"Well well well, looks like someone decided to do up the decor of this place. The last bar here was House Of Brews but it should have been called \"House of dirty drunk regulars and bathrooms that smell like pure garbage fire\". They cleaned up the joint for sure. The staff that works there are all pretty legit and take care of you when you are ready for a fresh ICEEEE COLDIIIEEEEEEEEE. Ill slurp there for sure. Only problem is, they go to country music by default if you're not manning the jukebox. Country music is the equivalent to listening to your entire family being murdered by polar bears. Saw some super drunk idiot sit at the bar and get cut off at 3 pm......Party. So, final thought, bring cheddar for music that wont make you want to die, order many brews, play golden tee like a moron and just get loaded up."}
{"text":"The place has a great atmosphere and food, but both the service and the servers are absolutely horrible. I waited 27 minutes to receive a Sprite with only 7 other customers in the restaurant. The food is very good, and comes out in good time but the waiters are not helpful, nor do they care about the service they are providing as it has been similar experience every time I have been in the neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Was excited to have a close bar near  home but it quickly  disappointed  with their poor service. Food  is okay, beer glasses taste like dish soap,  and management could care less. Power location is 100x better and will  continue to go there.  Looks like this  location will bite the dust based on reviews."}
{"text":"Second Cogburn's we've been to and this one is by far much better. Great service and always attentive, even when super busy. Big beers and good food. We stop by for UFC's fights and Cogburn's never disappoints."}
{"text":"This restaurant has ok food but the service is terrible.  Waitress was very slow couldn't get a beer order correct and took forever to take a order.  This restaurant is not busy and it could be a great place to go if they get better help. From the girls behind the bar to the waitress they all need a little training in customer service, friendliness.  You have a location surrounded by neighborhoods that can bring you business if you hire the correct people. The crew in there know will destroy your business"}
{"text":"It's been a long time waiting for something new to take over HOBs. I've been in a few times now. Very cold beer good happy hour prices. There is always some type of special going on. I've had a few items off their menu. beef sliders are good, wings are not that great. Service on the bar needs help.  1 of the ladies behind the bar is standing there talking while the other bartender is doing everything. At one time everyone on the bar had an empty glass. Most of the time you have to ask for a drink. The other issue I had was with our tab. The first receipt was $33 gave her my card, after 5 mins of them talking at the cash register she comes back with a tab of $48 with no details of what was purchased.  I asked how did my tab jump form $33 to $48. She said the other bartender didn't add 2 drinks. I told her the tab was right the first time. She says ok let me fix it. This is crazy!!! Why would you add to my tab and not tell me. Does she do this to everyone? Does she do it to the unaware patrons? Will she do this to patrons that had a little to much? Please take a double look at your tabs once returned."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new wing place of choice. After my longtime favorite alternative location closed down, and after a particular popular stop for wings became pretty pricey, my fiancée and I have been looking for a new date spot.  We stopped here on a late night whim, after seeing it a few times from the road. It looks pretty unassuming from the outside, but stepping through the door was the right choice. The music playing on the jukebox was perfect, and the menu was a pretty decent size, with pretty decent prices. I never knew a combination of hot wings, chips and guacamole would hit it off so well, but it was a definite winner.  The range of wing flavors was excellent, from pretty crazy choices (like peanut butter and jelly) to competitive heat. The staff was attentive, even at almost eleven on a Saturday night. Everything was clean, causal and laid back. Although it was listed as a bar, it didn't feel like the overwhelming bar atmosphere. Wings were awesome, sides were awesome--it was just an all around good date place. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Five stars because Elise (the hottest babe) is the best! Most of the girls aren't too bad to look at though. Food is good most of the time. My only problem with the joint is the lack of respect in management.. on that note  #brushyoteef too."}
{"text":"Wings are always great here as well as the salad's.  Like this location for my favorite bartender Tayler! She is always s pleasure with a great smile and great service. She never lets a beer glass get empty plus all her regular local customers love her."}
{"text":"Dropped by here for taco Tuesday to meet a friend for lunch. The tacos were pretty good and service was pretty quick. The place wasn't that busy since it was middle of the day during a weekday but my experience was good. I've been to the other Cogburns locations and the experience was similar with pretty good food and friendly, prompt waitresses."}
{"text":"Two stars for decent food. The service was laughable. I mean truly horrible. Seems to be a common issue from reading other reviews at this location. Two waitresses literally argued right Infront of us (tossing insults back and forth over us, as we sat down actually) about who's job it was to wipe our table. Once they figured that out, the girl who actually did it, complained to us that it wasn't even that dirty and she shouldn't be asked to clean it. It was truly bizarre.  Then three different people came over to take drink/food orders after we had already ordered. Clearly a lack of organization and leadership. There are so many people looking for work these days, they really need to re-evaluate who they have in this location interacting with customers."}
{"text":"Ehh......here we go another installment of \"THE NEW BAR\" on Warner and Cooper. This will be the 4th? 5th? Place here in like 6 years. They have shrunk the place down a bit, new seating, basic bar menu and tap beers have been scaled down. They did have some decent selections on tap, all female bar staff, and country music playing. It's the same professional alcoholic customer base the last few places have had. They've been sitting in those same chairs for years now. I guess this place would do in a pinch but I have to give it a solid C on the grading scale. Nothing outstanding, nothing disappointing. I didn't have anything to eat, we just had a few drinks and left."}
{"text":"If your into rap and average food this is the place if it wasn't for the good service I would have walked out good luck"}
{"text":"Nice place - plenty of space. Pretty good service - a bit slow at times, but acceptable. Food was pretty good. I had the fry bread, covered in refried beans and cheese. Tasty - not what I know as an \"Indian Taco\", but not bad. My wife had chicken fingers - a bit too much breading but tasted good and there was a good portion of white meat chicken. Drinks were relatively inexpensive. Overall, not bad. Would go back. Not a \"favorite\", but quick, tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"I went to Cogburn's today because I was looking for a bar that plays ASU football games. Not only did they play it but it was front and center with the sound playing. Score!!! When I saw this restaurant in Yelp I was hesitant because even though people liked the food most all reviews scored the service horribly. I care about service but I wanted to give them a shot. At least I would have the game to watch.  I am happy to report the service was outstanding. The food was delivered quickly, my drinks never ran dry and the server was happy and enthusiastic. Whew! The wings were pretty good; cooked perfectly. My wife and I shared the wings and got the raspberry/chipotle sauce. The sauce was good but I did not really taste the chipotle. Otherwise I would score the wings perfectly.  My wife and I also shared a Philly cheese steak sandwich. The sandwich was not as good. Not bad, mind you but it did not have as much flavor as we hoped for and the bread was a little too dry.  The atmosphere was awesome! The televisions were big, hi-def and everywhere! The decorations were fun! The prices were average but they have great specials like $6 burgers on Mondays, for example. The domestic beer was $3/bottle. BTW, the Sun Devils won so that was the cherry on top.  Go Devils! And Go Cogburn's!"}
{"text":"So excited that Cogburn's opened a new place so close to our house.  Our server Molly was excellent.  Very friendly & our food came quickly.  The wings & nachos were A+. We will definitely be coming back here again! Also  beer was ice cold! We really enjoyed our dinner & the ambiance. Well done Cogburn's, well done."}
{"text":"I asked for a manager and conveniently they weren't there (during lunch time). I have never been charged for extra dressing but this place wants .50! Does anyone know the profit a restaurant makes on a salad. Then, my mother is still eating her salad and the waitress asks to clear the plate. The waitress told me it's the kitchen management that charges! Really? The cook has more say so then the manager? I won't be back"}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have ever had! Mediocre food at best! The enchilada soup came out in a very shallow \"bowl\" and was barely a cup worth. It looked like super chunky salsa with no liquid at all. Dark red with big chunks of peppers. One taste and it was awful. I put it at the end of the table. When the rude waitress came by we asked her if that was the soup or chili. We didn't know lol. She says soup and walks away! She swooped by later and took the untouched soup. When the others were done with their mediocre food age asked if we wanted a box for our fries which were bad too. We said no they are over fried and she said yeah they are and walked away!!! When she brought the bill the soup was still on it. I told her to please remove it. It was awful and I didn't eat it. She argued with me that she couldn't take it off the bill! I told her to find someone that would get it off and she did and fired the bill at us! HORRIBLE!!! Never even asked if I wanted something else. She earned No $ tip just a note on customer service on the bill. Don't go."}
{"text":"Me and 3 of my coworkers went here today for lunch - NEVER AGAIN!  It took 55 minutes for our food to arrive (mind you we are on a one hour lunch break).  After waiting 45 minutes, one of us got up to go find a manager to ask about our food.  The person she talked to wouldn't get a manager but she was told \"somebody in the kitchen didn't show up for work today\".  No \"sorry about the wait\", just a rude response.  When our food finally came, it was all bagged to go, dropped on our table with the check, and the waitress took off.  What?  We didn't even ask for that, but the table next to us was pretty upset too as they too waited a long time for their food and finally had to leave so they may have asked for their food to go.  I had a burger and fries, it was meh.  Nothing to write home about.  They did end up only charging each of us 50% of our bill, but even so, I will not return."}
{"text":"First time here with my wife and our Indian Fried Bread and Chicken Tacos just came out. Tremendous. We will definitely be back just for those. Lots of cold beer and food options. Bravo. Cheers."}
{"text":"Went here when it first opened, and after loving House of Brews for food and beer selection and ambiance. The food was so-so and I hated the crowd and ambiance. Well something has changed in a few short months because now it's awesome. Food was bomb, awesome server (Elise) and bar staff, love it now. Can't wait to go back. So great. Except wish they put scallions on the potato skins. Weird without them. BYOS. Bring your own scallions. Love this place now!!"}
{"text":"Exceedingly unprofessional service and management. We were greeted by three hostess' who were sipping on their Bahama Bucks drinks, and texting. Sat down, ordered an appetizer, after finishing the appetizer we were told the food would be right out. We ordered a medium rare burger, and a Philly Cheese Steak. After waiting 20+ minutes the food came out and we were told that the plates were \"very hot.\" So hot that the server could barely hold them. When my wife cut into her burger there was not even a sliver of pink, beyond well done. My Philly Cheese Steak was beyond dry as the meat was crispy and curled up due to the heat lamps. When our server came back to check on us I let her know that my wife's burger was well done, and she had ordered it medium rare. Her response was that \"the food was sitting under the heat lamp for five minutes before I got it out to you.\" Yikes. That explains a lot. She offered to bring out a fresh burger cooked the way my wife wanted. I then mentioned how gross the Philly cheesesteak was and showed her the dried up curled meat. I asked her to talk with her manager and see what could be done. Within a minute the manger came to our table and apologized, and offered to comp everything but the appetizer. We were very appreciative, and thought that really said a lot about the management. Wrong. 15 minutes passed and still no burger, we asked our server when the burger would be ready...she said she would check. Within a minute the same manager came back and said \"the deal was I comped your meal and you pay for the appetizer only. I'm not giving you another burger.\" Welllll you threw the over cooked hockey puck burger away and was told a new one was already on the way and then told it would be comped.... We said thank you and no worries we just won't come back We will no longer be patrons of Cogburns. We weren't asking for a free meal by any means...just a decent meal? We have been there several times before, and the food and service continue to deteriorate. Kinda weird, the only time we have enjoyed this location was their grand opening weekend. Good luck, reviews are pretty spot on here for the negatives..."}
{"text":"Went to the new cogburn's located on the corner of Cooper and Warner. Kept my eye on it and couldn't wait for it to open. My girlfriend and I decided to watch a playoff football game there. Big mistake. The service was horrible, we order the appetizer which was a suppose it Garlic Knot plate, she'd forgot marinara for it, and it was like eating cardboard. We had the wings and although they were not skimpy they were not very tasty. I can say the beer was cold. They have this manager there, at least I think he's a manager that used to work for Mad Dog Saloon. In the four years that I went there I never saw him smile or he never said hi to me or anyone that I noticed. Guess what, my first interaction with him at cogburn's was the same. I'm wondering why someone in their right mind would hire someone like that to grow a business. So, we went there once and unfortunately will never return"}
{"text":"Absolutely an amazing sports bar and grill. I recommend getting getting cowgirl primavera.  Celine did an amazing work on keeping me updated on how long the food had until it was out. Definitely my new favorite sports bar. Go Cardinals."}
{"text":"Had wings in multiple different flavors. They were good but nothing out of this world. My biggest complaint was we sat outside and the stools are so old that they sag down so much your but didn't put in them. Management needs to put some money in new stools!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite bar to go to. All of the food is amazing, especially the burger and wings which are both on special Monday and Thursday respectively. Drinks are cheaper than any other bar I've been to and on Tuesday you can enjoy making any mixed drink a double for just a dollar. The bartenders Tiana and Lauren are always amazing as well as the servers Elise and Eyleen. Great specials, atmosphere and staff keep me coming back nearly every day. Definitely worth going to at least once if you haven't."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast friendly service. Neighborhood breasteraunt. Lively friendly place with great specials and a very friendly, inclusive clientele. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I have been to another location and enjoyed the food. This was my first time to the new Gilbert location, located where House of Brews used to be. They did not keep the electronic menus of HOB, but there were plenty of television screens showing multiple games. The seating was large enough to accommodate a lot of patrons, and the bar area was also large. It was Friday night about 10pm. Should be prime time for a bar, but it wasn't too busy. There was a good crowd around the bar, talking, drinking, listening to country music on the digital juke box - but not too many people in the restaurant area. We stood at the front for a few minutes waiting for someone to come to the hostess desk. Eventually they did arrive. We ordered a chicken chipotle pasta to share. I wondered about the wait because there was a guy who was already there and it seemed to be a while before his order arrived, and it looked like he had the same thing we ordered. But it was not too long of a wait before the dish arrived. Nice-sized portion with a side roll. The server brought out an extra plate and she was very friendly. She stopped a couple of times to check up on us. I had two sodas - the first was mostly water, but the second was better.   Overall the place seemed like a good location if you want to see some games, have a few beers, and listen to country. Plenty of space at the bar or in the restaurant for a group of friends. They have a reverse happy hour from 10pm to close, and an okay selection beers on draft and bottle. The service was friendly and the dish we had was good. I think it would be a good sport during football season to have some beer and wings, but it was a little surprising it wasn't too busy on a Friday night. Hopefully they can bring some more people in to support the location."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are amazing. The wings we ended up with were honey hot, raspberry chipotle, and medium.   Brownie points because this is closer to my house than the other locations.   Thursday is also wing night with $0.55 wings so feast away."}
{"text":"Been here a few times bartender on Sunday night can be kinda rude and your not worth her time unless your a friend or an established regular just my opinion"}
{"text":"Best burger and it's only $5 on Monday so I'll be back!  Also want to say the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went here with a coworker for lunch and to watch some march madness games. Ordered our food. Waitress didn't seem to know much about the menu. It took more than 45 minutes for the food to be served (burger and a wrap). We were about 2 minutes away from walking out as lunch time is limited for us working folk. Burger was mediocre. Patty was eerily similar to the frozen patties from Costco and the fries were a bit overdone. As noted in another review, I suppose this place would do in a pinch for a quick happy hour. Assuming it doesn't take as long to get a drink as it does to get your food. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for a few beers, wings and a good time. When we first walked in we were initially greeted by a server and she say us, grabbed is water and asked if we were ready to order. It was our first time there so I said no and she said she would be back. 10 minutes pass and the restaurant is pretty much dead it's just us and 3 other tables, with 2 servers on the floor. The server was on the floor and tending to her other tables but paying us no mind. A few times I raised my hand to get her attention but to no avail. She was all over her other 2 tables I saw her take them two draft beers, a salad, mozzarella sticks and a bunch of delicious food while meanwhile I was sitting there wishing it was for me. Eventually I gave up and tried to get the other servers attention. She passed our table 3-4 times every time I put my hand up and hung out our booth to get her attention but again to no avail. At this point it's been about 20 minutes and I ask my wife can we go somewhere else. She says yes and we do so. When we get up I made eye contact with the server who neglected us who was standing at a table 3 feet away and she immediately looks away as if she knows what happened but refused to acknowledge it. I'm not sure what happened I'm a courteous guy I say hello and smile and all that jazz. Not sure what it was. But either way I'm not going back to ask questions."}
{"text":"Good service. Little bit more of a grungy version of native. Food was typical bar food."}
{"text":"Beer was cold and around $6-7 a glass. Decent selection of beers, though almost half of their taps is of the Bud Light domestic variety. Service was mediocre and seemed a bit unconcerned about us. The chicken wings were pretty sad. I tried four different sauces, none of which were very good. Too bad it wasn't a more welcoming and cool place to hang out. We could use a decent neighborhood spot right there.  Maybe it will improve over time?"}
{"text":"Pros:  The wings are very good with some original flair choices.   Cons:  Extremely slow service, no matter how slow or busy it is. The waitstaff lack a personality and seem unsure of what they are doing. If you don't sit in the bar area, it's like you pretty much don't exist.   It's common for it to take 10 minutes for your drink to get to you. Minimal wait time, even for an appetizer is around 20 minutes. Again, this is even when the place is slow. The place just has a vibe that nobody really knows what they are doing or lack experience in the bar/restaurant industry. We've given this place a few chances, and have been disappointed each time. It's a shame, because he food it pretty good."}
{"text":"Amazing wings! Sit at the bar!  Great country music, Deals for wings and beer were excellent. Probably the worst service I have ever received. The waitress even made an expression when she saw our table sit down. We had to go get our own napkins, ordered a second round before we were half way done with beers-because we knew it would be a longer than normal wait. Save yourself the hassle, sit at the bar. I would have given 4-5 stars if service was actually decent."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!! My husband and I waited 10 minutes for a server and nothing. While we were waiting 5 different servers walked past our table, 2 of which looked at us, smiled, and continued walking. It wasnt like the place was busy, there were 4 other tables in the entire restaurant. We were looking forward to trying their food but that did won't be happening. We ended up leaving and going to Buffalo Wild Wings. The place was packed with tables and we still received faster service."}
{"text":"First let me say I have never sat down and eaten in the restaurant. We order to go only. The wings here are so good!! The garlic Parmesan wings are the best flavor I've ever had. The medium is super tasty too. Their french fries are so good also."}
