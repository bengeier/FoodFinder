{"text":"Honestly, this place is in between a 2 and a 3. The restaurant itself is very small and only has about 8-10 tables tops. I have been here for both AYCE and regular a la carte, and both are affordable. The all you can eat menu is pretty limited compared to most other places but it's also about $5 cheaper per person than places like 168. The a la carte is fine and the bento boxes are a great deal. At about $12 for a bento box with soup, salad, one maki roll, tempura, gyoza, rice and protein of your choice it's good value. However the food is always just okay. I have never gone in here and said \"Wow\", it's just somewhere to go that's close by and relatively cheap. Also the service here isn't the best. The female server is always grumpy, and since the place is so small the staff just stand around watching you eat which makes you feel REALLY uncomfortable. 

All in all there are much better places in the area where you might spend a bit more but the food & service will be better."}
{"text":"This small store serves smoothies, bubble tea and sushi. Their sushi from what I've seen is prepackaged. I have yet to actually try it though. I have had their Mango Slush. They've had a special on it for quite a while. For a large Mango Slush under $4, it is definitely a steal. They use real mangos and it tastes really good for the price. I have also tried their strawberry smoothie thing (forgot what it's called), it was also on a special price which was the same as the Mango Slush for the same size. They seem to use a hand smoothie blender, the great thing is that the slush and smoothies were really smooth and had a nice consistency. Regarding the seating, there is barely any. Considering how small the shop is and how mostly what they serve is takeout and drinks, I don't think it will be a big deal. They aren't that busy anyways so the few seats available won't be too hard to snatch. 
Overall they are a decent small store that serves good drinks."}
{"text":"Trust the other Yelp reviewers, this place is great. They only serve sushi though, no hot foods (except for miso soup).

The maki rolls are delicious. Portions are great. Price point is also decent.

Cindy is the lady that works there. She's friendly and willing to make substitutions for you. I've been here twice and both times have been a win!

There are 2 things I didn't like though: they don't offer low-sodium soy sauce, and the salad dressing is mediocre.

Give this place a try and let us know your thoughts."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Our favourite sushi spot in Oakville right now.  I have been a handful of times and am never disappointed by the high quality sushi and quick service.

The all-you-can-eat is the recommended way to go.  Don't bother with the menu. There is both a lunch and a dinner all-you-can-eat and it is excellent value for your money.  

Not only is the sushi great, but the rolls are delicious (spicy salmon and tuna), as are all of the fried rice and soba noodle dishes.  Great for sharing!  There is good variety on the menu for appetizers, sushi, teppanyaki, noodles, rolls and dessert.  

We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Was there for lunch today.  The  waitress was  very unhappy and   did not allow a welcomed atmosphere at all.  My guess is that  she hates her job  and is taking it out on the customers.     She was down right snarly....more later.
I ordered the seafood udon soup,   there was some imitation crab  pieces in the soup,   but no sign of any other seafood.  (  Was unable to finish ) 
Next,  the   onion  salmon   was a big piece of  fat with 1 bite of pink salmon that I could tease off the top.   The teriyaki  salmon was good.  Then I ordered a  dynamite roll.  There was so much rice,  I  could not finish it all, I   ended up  eating up the middle of the roll,  and leaving the outer  bits  of  4/8 pieces.     
The waitress came and scolded me and stated that I could not  have anything more  from the menu unless I  finished the rice that was left on my plate!!!
The chef seemed oblivious and / or  uncaring of what went on..He never looked up  to see what was going on in the restaurant.
I will never go here again.  The wait   staff   (  one woman)  was AWFUL   and  really unprofessional.   She did not clear my plates as the meal progressed and just left them to accumulate on the table.  She was   dismissive to me,  and  down right rude  at the end. 
  I    paid and did not even leave a tip  at all.  Felt so  uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Best Sushi Place in Oakville.  The Place is small and the ambiance is nothing much.  The food is great and the staff are friendly.  They have the same lunch rate through out the week including the weekend which is great.  Highly recommend their 'dynamite roll'."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place a three star because I have experienced better AYCE sushi, and better sushi period. This comes down mostly to the restaurant's atmosphere/space and the limited AYCE lunch selection. But it's so conveniently located and the staff are so friendly that I just know I'll be going here again soon--and don't get me wrong, the sushi is good too! 

Their lunch menu is limited, but if you're not fussed about getting exotic sounding rolls of sushi, like a Kamikaze or Las  Vegas, you'll be fine. 

The dinner menu is better, though both lunch and dinner offer only iced cream for dessert--no sesame balls or fried banana. (If you're the owner and reading this, please add these in. :)

The place is very small, and I definitely wouldn't pick it for a first date or to go with anyone I don't know well. There are three \"booth\" type tables, and 3 or 4 regular tables.  It should be dead around lunchtime on weekdays, but on weekends it's busy/full. 

Tips are included in your bill which threw me off at first because my $18.99 weekday dinner came to +$23. But that includes tax, and the staff are so friendly I would have probably tipped the same or more!

You can also order from their better a-la-carte menu (pay for each food item), or take out which many people do."}
{"text":"Upon reading the positive reviews, we have decided to drop by and pick up a sushi tray or two for a night in. 

This is a small place, so don't expect a super extensive menu. We ordered the roll tray special which came with 4 rolls of choice and paid around $15. Although basic, but the quality is decent, and the price simply cannot be beat ! Much better value than what you'd get at MAC sushi / other chained sushi places"}
{"text":"Bang for your buck sushi :) Got the PC14 daily combo (8pc red dragon roll, 3pc salmon sushi, 3pc eel sushi + miso soup + salad), all for just under $15 with tax. The portions are also pretty big and service was friendly and quick. It took probably 10mins for them to make everything on the spot for me. Sushi was pretty fresh for the price too. Definitely will be hitting this spot up again next time I have sushi cravings! Satisfies the stomach without breaking the bank"}
{"text":"Nice little hidden gem in Scarborough for those craving an affordable sushi fix. We ordered a jumbo party tray (120 pcs for $95) for 5 people and it fed us for nearly two meals.

The price was incredible for the quality. Keep in mind this is no high end sushi joint so the quality will be lacking a bit but nonetheless it was delicious. All their maki was HUGE, literally need to take two bites to eat it. The sashimi and sushi was cut nicely and generously portioned. 

Try to call ahead of time as they do get super busy. We waited an hour-ish on Friday for our tray. We did call in prior but they were rammed. Their ready made sushi is 30% off after 7pm - an incredible deal! Dine-in option is super limited as they only have two tables with two chairs each and a small bar table that seats 3. 

A lovely couple runs this business with limited English but are super friendly and full of smiles. Would definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"You would never expect a place like this to serve up some  delicious, yet affordable sushi.... but this is one of them!!! Run by a Chinese couple, they are super sweet and accommodating. 

We decided to order a party tray as we were tired & hungry. We didn't want two of the rolls that were featured in the \"red\" tray, and to our surprise the owner was very accommodating as to switch for rolls that we preferred for no extra charge! We basically switched a California roll for a spicy salmon roll. They also serve a daily special combo that is comes with soup & salad - and you can add a LARGE bubble tea for an additional $3 (sounds like an amazing deal to me). 

When we got the platter, the fish was super fresh and the rolls were huge - major keys to delicious sushi. The party tray we got was actually recommended by the owner herself. Everything came in twos, which was great for us to share.

We also ordered drinks because we can never resist when we see a drink menu. We got the mango slush as well as the strawberry lychee slush. Unfortunately the strawberry lychee slush had a bit of a funky aftertaste but the mango slush did not disappoint!!! 

The restaurant itself is definitely intended for a take-out setting, as it occupies a very small space with two small tables. This will be my go-to place when I'm looking for a quick bite and specifically craving for sushi, as they offer individual-sized trays."}
{"text":"Nice place for a good meal. The staffs are welcoming. The price is so good compared to the quality of food. Bubble Tea is one thing that brings me here."}
{"text":"Smoothies are delicious, definitely one of my favourites. My boyfriend highly enjoys the sushi and the pricing here is pretty cheap, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love it. Small store (mainly takeout) but they have 2 small tables with 2 chairs each. Affordable prices and nice owners. 12 pcs of salmon is 4.99 - cant go wrong"}
{"text":"Quick stop in a pretty good strip mall for food, parking can be a pain at times but nonetheless the food was fresh and rolled right before your eyes for a simple take out meal for a great price. Sushi tasted perfect will be back for me!"}
{"text":"got some takeout from this place at 20%
off. it is a good deal i find at 8.99 for quite a vit of salmon. and the owner was nice. i think the thing that made it lose two stars was the rice and the spicy salmon. the spicy salmon roll had no punch at all. and needed more of a kick to it. it didnt have much flavour which is surprising consider its a spicy salmon roll. the rice itself was too moist and too wet. i would recommend those who want to go for a quick eat. and overall it isnt bad for what you pay. the salmon sushi is acceptable. and the price is decent considering what amount you are getting"}
{"text":"Ordered from DoorDash and received a horrible salad with brown lettuce, clearly old soup and the spicy crispy salmon maki was just despicable. Will never purchase from this horrible restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place has really affordable sushi and excellent quality for the price! Love how they have end of the day specials, and they give you a great discount on sushi.

Their bubble tea is awesome! I got a Large Taro bubble milk tea for $3.99 which is really affordable.

This will continue to be my go-to bubble tea / take-out sushi place."}
{"text":"I was excited to find out there is a sushi place in the neighborhood but was not impressed at all after trying it .
I have no problem with small restaurant. Just kinda disappointed in their food . Shrimp tempura tastes weird . My kids usually went through those so fast .. but they only had one each and told me \" I don't like it \" . If you can't even get that done right then there is noting more for me to say ."}
{"text":"There are a couple of things I judge sushi restaurants by. One is the freshness of the food, and this one had fresh food. But to my big disappointment, all the rolls that have fish in them are filled with tempura bits. We had spicy salmon rolls, and there was almost no salmon inside. I hate to eat only tempura bits and rice. That tells me that the owner is cheap, and he fills the space with tempura so he wouldn't put fish  inside. This is my last time here for sure."}
{"text":"At first, I was skeptical about this sushi place when I was in this strip mall.  But I decide to give this place a try.   Surprisingly, this isthe best takeout sushi platter I ever had.  Sushi was fresh and the prices are very affordable.

To the owners:  keep up the same service and quality.  I will be back and spread a good word about your place.  

2nd update:  went to Mika yesterday based on my last positive experience, it was not a disappointment, all I could say they maintained their quality!"}
{"text":"\"Holy Rice balls batman!\"

So I popped in there for lunch today since the place is so darn convenient for me to get to. I think the problem with this sushi restaurant is that I've gotten used to average to pleasant service and food in most places that I've been too.  My budget doesn't allow me to go super high-end but it does allow me to have an overall positive experience and the various places that I go to.
      This place misses the mark on a couple of fronts.  First off, the service isn't the friendliest that I've experienced.  I'm used to smiling Japanese people greeting me enthusiastically usually.  However here, the server was downright surly. felt like I was an inconvenience to her checking her Facebook updates on her Iphone.  The chef is also equally surly and you can tell that he's all business and very little joy in what he's doing.  A lot of times even they'll shout a \"thank-you\" to me as I leave.  But not here... not a farewell... not a nod... not even an acknowledgment of my existence.
     But the real disappointent is the quality of the food.  This place is cheap with its portions!  They're overly generous with the rice (so you can fill up faster) but they provide the narrowest cuts of fish to rest on that rice.  You'll never leave hungry but you'll probably never want sticky rice ever again.  I'm not 100% sure but I think the rice that they used may have been stale.  It lacked flavour and was a little chewy at times.

    Hopefully they figure out how to run a nice customer-focused sushi restaurant in the near future.  At this point, I won't be back and I'll gladly pay a little extra somewhere else for better service and better quality."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating take out sushi- so of course it's not top notch sushi quality- but for a quick bite their prices and quality matches. We ordered the salmon skin, spicy crab + salmon rolls for $13.99 for ~ 30 pieces. The only reason my review wasn't a 4 star was because they overly dress the sushi with the spicy mayo, and our salmon skin was felt very stale. But overall, I'll probably pop by to try out their other menu items."}
{"text":"Received a recommendation for this place, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It's definitely worth trying - their service was quick and the staff was friendly.  I ordered my sushi tray at 5pm and they were ready in merely 20 minutes.  I really loved the unagi sushi and is super impressed they gave 4 rolls compared to other places. The price for their party trays were also very decent compared to other places. I ordered the red dragon mini party tray which came with 30 pcs for only $22.99."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to try this place since it was in a random Plaza and looked a little run down... But after I read the Yelp reviews I decided to give it a shot. 

Man am I glad I did! I stopped by this afternoon - they have a delicious selection of pre-made take out sushi for extremely cheap and they also have a sit-in option. I opted for the sit in lunch special - red dragon roll, salmon sushi and California roll, but decided to swap out the California roll for a spicy salmon and they did that for no charge. The special came with miso soup and salad and you had the option to add on a bubble tea for an extra $3. 

Overall for $12.99 you get a generous amount of sushi, that's surprisingly high quality and delicious!

A lot of the takeout options were very cheap ($4.99 for  spicy salmon rolls) which I'll definitely be trying next time!

Definitely recommend that you're in the area! 5/5 for taste, quality and price!"}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews, we decided to give it a try. We ordered Take out two sets - red dragon, California roll and salmon sushi set $12.99 two any kind of rolls (8 pieces) plus 4 any type sushi $10.99.  The salmon sushi is quite good, tastes fresh and the rice is just right.  Just the spicy salmon roll is very bad, the crunchy thing inside is so hard, DONOT order them. Salmon and avocado roll is good.  California roll is just normal.  Red dragon roll is ok because of the tempera inside is not fresh. We also ordered mango slush and ordinal bubble tea, quite good. Will come back for more salmon sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi here is fresh and the rolls are huge! They make the prepackaged boxes on the same day they serve but if you ask for a fresh one they'll make it on the spot. They have good deals there too! The couple that run the shop it are friendly. They have limited seating 3 tables (6 seats total), but they're more of a take out sushi. They serve bubble tea here too!"}
{"text":"I downloaded and signed up to yelp just so I could confirm what people are saying about terrible service. We showed up at 8:15 and the women told us three times the kitchen closes at 9, awkward. She stood there staring at us the whole time, even when my sister accidentally spilled a cup of soy sauce on her self and her boyfriend. she didn't come over to offer napkins. 

My boyfriend asked if he could have an avocado and cucumber roll, the waitress said \" no, only avocado on its own, cucumber on its own; or shrimp, avocado and cucumber\" what the hell?   

While eating , three women showed up and were turned away because they asked if they could substitute salmon for crab In the California roll. 

Pretty terrible service, the food isn't terrible. I wouldn't recommend eating at Mika."}
{"text":"Good sushi, affordable and offer discount if pay in cash. Large selection, always busy for takeout, not too many seats inside restaurant. It's our regular go-to sushi place as it tastes as good as any other place that charges a lot more."}
{"text":"This is a all you can eat sushi place with the best and freshes sushi you can get. Very nice clean little place just opened maybe 9 months ago. Been going there ever since once a month. Prices are pretty good."}
