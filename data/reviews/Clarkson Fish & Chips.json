{"text":"Excellent fish and chips. Crispy light batter, not greasy and heavy which is great. Real neighbourhood place."}
{"text":"It's a definite greasy spoon, hole-in-the-wall (see: somehow it's a non-smoking establishment but I still smell smoke coming from somewhere!!) BUT the portions are good and most importantly, the fish is fresh and the chips are perfectly crispy on the outside and mashed potato-y fluffy on the inside.  Seating is pretty limited (around 35 seats) and is a mixed crowd ranging from families to retirees and everything in between.  I would highly recommend the halibut & chips and the haddock is a close second.  As Becca G mentions, service is \"curt\" at best (hence 4 star rating) and on numerous occasions, the waitress forgot to bring everything except for our main course.  It's what we've come to expect and yet we still go back to Clarkson's Fish & Chips time & time again.  It gets crazy busy on Friday nights so if you can, call ahead for take out orders to save yourself some time."}
{"text":"Good Fish. They serve up very good portions and don't skimp on the fish. Helen's Fish and chips was sold a few years back. The new owners are not providing the quality fish we remembered. Clarkson's Fish and Chips is a very close second to the \"OLD\" Helen's Chippery. That's my new Friday Fish and Chips place Thanks for keeping it real!"}
{"text":"It's simple, it's not classy, it small - BUT - the very best fish and chips in Mississauga and you have to try the cole slaw - the best rainy day meal to warm you up.  Don't let the location or front of store deter you - I guarantee it will be the best fish & chips - EVER !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Clarkson's Fish and Chips is GOOD.  It's your usual dive-y looking greasy spoon type of place in a shabby plaza, but who cares when the fish is hot and fries are.... hot....  You can sure rely on this place to bring you hot, right out of the deep-frier deliciousness!  They've actually recently spiffed up the inside, with some new wood decor and a fresh coat of paint, which is nice.  The crowd is usually old people which is awesome.  I suggest getting an order of the halibut and chips, with a side of mushy peas and a bottle of Scotland's original orange pop Irn Bru or Dad's Rootbeer.  Their chicken fingers are really good too, even though they're probably frozen.  They're crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The owner, who acts as head waitress, doesn't say much and may come off rude, but I think she's just serious about her job and to-the-point.  Say your please and thank yous and I'm sure she'll take them to heart.  Overall, this place kicks Port Credit's 'Helen's Fish and Chips' butt, because when I cut into my piece of fish, I expect to find meat, not have my batter break into a mess of crumbs.  And they say they cook it by weight... sure.  Anyway, go to Clarkson Fish and Chips, they'd love to have your business and warm your bellies."}
{"text":"this is classic comfort food at its best, if you want the best fish and chips in the city, here they are. The interior would have looked great 20 years ago but who cares, I have been to amazing looking restaurants who had the worst food. If you have a craving this is the place you want to hit up!"}
{"text":"Visited this quaint old joint that has has a homely atmosphere after a relaxing massage at Relaxology,  located next to the restaurant.   Service was not very friendly but the fish was amazing.  I had the Haddock and my girlfriend had the cod. We both shared a bite from our meals and the Haddock was very tasty.   The batter was extremely crispy and although the fish was deep fried, there was hardly any oil. The chips.... that's another story. Although a bit soggy,  they tasted good but I highly recommend the coleslaw. They can substitute the fries for the coleslaw if requested.   All in all a great place for a quick bite. They would have earned 5 stars if the fries were not soggy."}
{"text":"I knew the food was going to be great with I saw that it was packed with people over the age of 70! Sure enough, the coleslaw and halibut & chips were wonderful! Great portion, crispy, good quality fish. I can't wait to go back! Oh, don't expect much from the service though, it's a mom and pop place and the tables get cleaned as they're needed."}
{"text":"A definite hole in the 'strip mall' wall type of restaurant but I have to say our halibut was really good and came hella quick!!! The price was pretty average and the service was decent. The only issue was since they put the fish in top of the fries they were soft as instead of nice and crisp."}
