{"text":"Came here for a late dinner after work. After scouting out the nearby food options and deciding that we didn't want bar food, my girlfriend and I were delighted to see a decently romantic looking Italian restaurant without a large price tag. A quick glance over the menu at the door pretty much had me set on the pasta.   Upon sitting down, we were promptly served drinks and placed out order. I called the pasta vittoria which had capellini, prociutto, roasted red peppers and goat cheese, while my girlfriend called the pasta milano which was a creamy tomato based chicken spagetti with ricotta cheese. We were served bread while waiting for the pastas, but it was nothing impressive. For a place with a woodfire oven, I had hoped the bread would be fresher but it was pretty dry and stale. The balsamic vinegar however was probably one of the best I have had at any restaurant. The food came really fast and was cooked to my exact liking. The pasta was al dante with a great texture while the prociutto was subtle and not overpowering. The goat cheese was creamy and complimented the pasta well. I also had a bite of the milano which was also superb.   Overall, for the price you pay, this is an excellent place to take a date for a bite to eat. The atmosphere is excellent, and if you don't mind stale bread the this place is near perfect. Definitely coming back to  try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Horrible spelt pizza! Practically disgusting, the vegetarian one! Won't return here! Also they serve calamari fried that are frozen rings:( what Italian restaurant does that?! I found the atmosphere lacking as well! I actually asked if they were frozen and to our surprise the waiter offered the grilled but we were pressed for time, friend ate them."}
{"text":"Amore trattoria has the best pizza I ever tried!!! They make a real paper-thin crust, that's what a real authentic Italian pizza should be. The service there is really impeccable! All the servers are very professional, they're dressed nicely, no jeans or careless shirts. The food was brought in in a timely manner, we didn't have to wait for too long. Our waiter, Ruben, was very considerate, and had an answer to every question we had. The only reason I'm not giving full 5 stars is the because their tiramisu is a bit dense, definitely doesn't take you very high. It was very tasty, just not very fluffy and cloud-like. The prices are very reasonable. The dishes at this restaurant are good 2-3$ less than those at other ristorantes italianos in this area, but they're so much better. I had great time at this restaurant and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"should be better, can get much tastier mid range Italian elsewhere. ordered from uber eats. The pizza margarita was good and tasty thin crust perfect amount of cheese, but the pastas and salad were not good not horrible or inedible but just bad. The arrabiata was simply pene which was cooked fine topped with passata ( plain purred  tomatoes) and possibly a bit of chili oil. I cook pasta often so I know I can tell by the colour too it was bright red meaning it was never cooked out as any good sauce should be.  was like something a toddler would eat, plain noodles with pureed tomatoes. The other pasta was over cooked angel hair with very very thin almost tomato water pesto combination with artichokes straight from a can . To make it  edible we had to pile on cheese and chili flakes. The salad was a green mix from a box toped with pale tomatoes and bocincini that had seen better(softer) days. They included some obviously grocery store baked baguette slices with butter which was nice and honestly   my favourite part of the meal! Also the food came very fast. This would be great if you had kids. pizza and very plain tasting pastas lots of buttered white bread."}
{"text":"I ordered the gnocchi w/ pesto cream sauce. The sauce was fantastic...so i was really excited. But there was still this strange taste to the gnocchi that I couldnt figure out. The gnocchi itself almost tasted old...but I knew that wasnt it. After one got stuck to the roof of my mouth..i finally realized what it was: flour. It was so prominent! I couldnt finish my plate. The texture and sauce were really nice...so the flour totally ruined it. The calamari was nice though! The dipping sauce...not so much."}
{"text":"* * * * *  Amore is a perfectly situated gem in the booming Yonge & Eglinton area!   Great service! great food! great atmosphere! not much else you can ask for if you want amazing Italian cuisine at a fair price and in a great setting with family/friends. Their lunch/dinner dishes are epic! but, this place has a little secret that not a lot of people know about.. and if Torontonian's knew, it would change breakfast in the city.  Amore is perhaps one of the best breakfast spots in. the. city.!  I like to judge a breakfast place by it's ability to do an 'egg benedict'--their bacon benedict is amazing--homemade hollandaise sauce is the game changer! the truth is, I wish they served 3 egg benedicts on an english muffin rather than 2, because it keeps you wanting more! they also have great breakfast juices (mmm, pineapple!)  The problem: Breakfast is ONLY on weekends between 11a-4pm.. so those who work on weekends are pretty much SOL. To tell you the truth, whenever I do get a day off on the weekend, this is one of the first thoughts that I have: \"breakfast at Amore' then I think about all the other possibilities for the day...   Keep it classy ladies and gentlemen, enjoy!  -Ace  \"There cannot be good living where there is not good drinking\""}
{"text":"Don't even bother. Maybe 40 years ago this place was decent but in 2017... forget it. Cappuccino undrinkable, oily eggs, canned fruit in summer, maitre'd smelled hungover. Keep moving"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch as the carribean place down the block was closed.  Service was average... nothing special but not horrible.  Salads have too much dressing on them.  Pasta is ok, but not great.  Bottom line, I wouldn't come back any time soon - I think they rely a great deal on their location as the foot traffic is heavy and it's easy to drop in.  However, the food is unremarkable and not worth the price."}
{"text":"Not sure why so many negative reviews. We decided to try this restaurant and we loved it. I'm not going to go fancy on the description, but i am going to say that the pizza was incredible, the veal chop perfect and the tiramisu simply beyond. Also I really enjoyed the relax non pretentious atmosphere. Service was friend and knowledgeable suggesting great dishes. Overall I would come back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Two reasons why I always came back to Amore Trattoria was- the option of making your own pizza and pasta. Sadly, Amore has taken these options off the menu. Noooooo!  The service and quality of the food remains excellent. However, the menu seems so limited now with those options taken out. Personally, it's been difficult to find something on the menu that I would like. I tried out their lamb pasta special- perfectly cooked pasta, boring tomato sauce, and juicy pieces of lamb. The only good thing about this dish was the lamb, nothing else. The dishes are rather pricey too for what they are.   The dining experience at Amore is not the same anymore since they've taken out their option of customizing your own pizza's and pasta's. I don't think I'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Came on Thanksgiving Day for brunch. Since most places were not open, my bf and I didn't have too many choices.   Decor is comfortable, but the tables for two were a little small. I had a waffle with spinach and eggs which was pretty standard - and it tasted pretty standard. The whip cream on the side was a nice touch.   My bf had a frittata with spicy italian sausage, red peppers and cheese. Looked good on paper but tasted very bland. So unflavourful almost like an overcooked omelette with some random stuff inside.  I hope the 3 slices of toasted wheat italian bread he had on the side was good at least?   However, on a positive note, our server was very nice and enthusiastic. He had such a positive attitude working on Thanksgiving Day I really appreciated it.  The wood fire oven looked good... maybe pizza next time... hopefully the food would be better!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite neighborhood brunch spots. I have been here probably 10 times and I would say service wise 7/10 they are on their A game. I like to get the smoked salmon eggs Benedict but with the smoked salmon on the side (I find if it comes on top it cooks it). Its a classy yet reasonably priced spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been eating here for years and its always been consistent. The owner is usually around and he's super friendly and really helpful. Very nice and intimate atmosphere, never have trouble getting a table or reservation.   The food is wonderful! There is a huge menu with so many options anyone can find something to eat. The quality of the food is really great, very tasteful and they will always make substitutions or changes if need be. I've had the salads, All fantastic (Caprese is my favorite it's got a really nice balsamic on it and fresh tasting ingredients). The pastas are all incredible and super hearty. And the pizzas are really fabulous, I can never decide between the pizzas and pastas that's how good they both are. The only complaint is that the bread basket is always a little hard and stale tasting, (it's never been soft) but we usually save our appetite for the food.   The service is always very attentive and friendly. I've been there so many times and NEVER once have I had a mistake in my order. All in all this is a fantastic place and its not over priced!"}
{"text":"Amore is a great place to eat healthy food in big portions.  Delicious pasta,  great service and friendly management. It's a hidden gem of the yonge and eglinton area. I go there often with my girlfriend and we absolutely love it.  We often regret going elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went on Valentine's Day... It was awful!  We always used to drive by and thought this restaurant looked nice. Service was mediocre, at best. We had two different waiters ask our orders and then both came back to confirm it- very disorganized! We also had to send back a water glass and cutlery as they were dirty! Now the food- we ordered marguerite pizza and Ceasar salad. Salad leaves were wilted and there was brown on the edges of the leaves. Also, the salad was disgusting! We were enticed by the open oven  but were highly disappointed. The only flavor we tasted, on our pizza, was salt- no basil, no cheese, no tomatoes, nothing! We had two bites and left! This place was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Was there for lunch recently.  S.O. and I both liked our dishes.  The accompanying salad was really fresh.  But the best thing about lunch was the bruschetta - the best I've had in a long time.  The goat cheese was amazingly fresh. For those in the Yonge and Eg area who go to Grazie's I'd recommend this as a great alternative.  The only drawback is that their menu is not quite as extensive. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I dont want to diss this place at all with three starts it is really more 3.5 put I dont have that option.  This place is really decent, I went for brunch a little while ago and it is a very nice looking place.  I found there wasn't much I was interested in on the menu and the food was ok but nothing blew me away.  The prices were just a little bit over what I thought they should be for what we got.  That being said it was busy inside and yet we still had really fantastic service so overall I would probably go back. Maybe for dinner next time though."}
{"text":"I had reviewed this restaurant based on a meal had at dinnertime in February.  I came today for lunch ordering along with my companion, essentially the same items as the previous time (Latina salad, Wild Snapper fish special, and basic pepperoni mushroom and green pepper pizza on spelt crust).  While the salad tasted as good as the last time it was less pentiful (not as much arugula as previously), the pizza at almost $14.00 was a horrendous disappointment, however, especially as this is a staple on the menu.  The pepperoni tasted stale and was of a greyish-light brown colour that I have never seen before.  The crust was of a texture and flavour that I did not recognize and would not expect in a pizza of this calibre.  The other ingredients were paltry (except for the cheese) and not particularly fresh looking.  The sauce was also a very strange flavour-unlike any I had ever tasted.  While the fish entree was large enough, it did not taste particularly fresh.  It was basically edible.  The cappellini and sauteed vegetable side was adequate in terms of both the quality and the amount of the ingredients.  I did not leave hungry.  All in all the value of the entree and salad were a 2 to 3 star but the pizza would be zero. The restaurant was still clean and the service still attentive and friendly.  I am not sure if the chefs change throughout the week or at lunch and dinner but based on this last meal, and with the exception of the very good dill leek and white wine-based sauces and dressings found in the Latina salad for example, I cannot really recommend this restaurant-certainly not for the PIZZA."}
{"text":"I actually intended on visiting North 44, but for some reason I couldn't find the bloody place. Once in a blue moon, I lose all sense of direction. So what more appropriate time for such occurrence with a very important Woman once in my life from Britain visiting?  With all the competitions in the area, including Centro, what was my justification for coming here? Well, turned out I needn't to be justified after all. The place was alright.  There's nothing to see from the outside, in fact, the idea of not being able to find North 44, and discovering this place instead is just..ridiculous.  What a cozy place, very intimate atmosphere, highly questionable art. It was as if a six grader took a fast and furious class on the Renaissance, went to the back yard, and glued a bunch of recyclable materials on the canvas, fixed it to an expensive frame from another painting, and cried until someone finally hanged it up.  Inside it didn't feel as if there was actually any light at all, yet somehow I was able to see. Not a large piece of real estate by any means, but comfortable.  The Pollo Parmigiana was alright, slightly better than what I had at Franky Tomatoes. However, that could be my lack of knowledge in Italian food. It was really saucy. I can't remember what my friend ordered, I was too distracted by her--like I said, she was once very important to me.  Our dinner was accompanied by water, she ordered the Pellegrino. I never understood the hype of carbonated water. It just doesn't make any sense to me.  Honestly, I'm not complaining about the place, whether because it was some time ago, or just that I was so entrench with my company,  it's just that Amore wasn't exactly very memorable. And that's never a good thing."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I have some crappy leftovers from Amore for lunch. You know your food is shitty when your customer is wishing she could replace your dish with one she made a few weeks ago that rocked her dinner party.   But don't get me wrong, it's not so horrible that I'd give it a lowly 1-star. It's not that shitty. It's two-star shitty.   There's nothing on the wine list that's worth getting or overly appealing. Everything is $9+ by the glass. And don't ask the staff what they recommend because they can't tell California from Niagara Falls (in their defense, I suppose grizzly bears could survive in both regions*).   They also make you feel like they don't like you. I wasn't sure if I was dining at a restaurant or in the back of some asshole Torontonian taxi cab. All I know now is that both will screw you by charging you a rate that could buy you a mansion in Burma.   For a first year engagement anniversary dinner, the only thing that saved our dinner was the fact that we're still interesting enough to entertain each other.   Maybe I should have taken my hubby's advice and settled for Chipotle.  *Although the grizzly bear appears on the Californian state flag, the last one in the state was shot dead in 1922. Grizzlies used to live in California and the Niagara Falls regions in the post-glacial era, but now live in the far north (Yukon, Alaska, etc) when not confined to city zoos for human amusement."}
{"text":"A few weeks back I had a very good lunch meeting at this little bistro located just north of Yonge and Eglington.  It really is a beautiful spot, simply decorated with 2 floors of seating, an advantage for busier nights - aka no shortage of seating. The space is kept warm and warms our bellies with a Wood burning pizza oven open for us all to see. Seeing this excited me for my lunch ahead!  This was until I saw the specials on the lunch menu. After much deliberation I decided on having the blackened Fish special with mixed veggies and rice. Ya that's right, I had the option to go Pizza but went healthy instead.  The Fish was excellent, fall apart with a fork - cooked beautifully, 2 generous pieces and yes spiced and cooked to a blackened perfection! The Veggies were plentiful a huge portion of bok choi, sliced carrots, and grilled peppers. However, the rice was horribly cooked, stuck together, dry and unseasoned not really a great addition to the dish.  Price for lunch special was $18.95, reasonable considering the higher end style of the venue.   Looking forward to returning to carb out on their pizza and pastas they sounded delish!  3.5 star overall in my books!"}
{"text":"this is one of my facorite neighborhood brunch spots. I have been here probably 10times and I would say that service wise 7/10 they are on their A game.  I like to get the smoked salmon eggs benny with the smoked salmon on the side( I find it cooks it if left on). It is a classy yet reasonably priced spot."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to write this review because their staff is so lovely, but the food at Amore has really gone downhill. It used to be one of my favourite Italian restaurants in midtown but the quality of the food on my last visit was mediocre at best. I ordered the caprese salad which was drowning in balsamic dressing and the quattro formaggi pizza which was very dry and lacking in flavour. I felt like I could have made it at home by sprinkling some shredded cheese on a piece of flatbread and zapping it in the microwave. The rest of my party was very disappointed in their meal selections as well. I hope they were just having a bad night because the people who work here are always very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! Reasonable prices and a lovely ambiance."}
{"text":"Solids threes all around. Came here for a family function. Had a pizza with salami, mushrooms and some other things. Was decent. My gfs pasta was good but nothing special. Waiter seemed a bit confused. There are better if pricier options in the area \"zucca \" cough cough."}
{"text":"One of the main selling points of Amore for me was the fact that you could choose your own pizza toppings, and thus create your own unique, and perfect, pizza. Unfortunately, they no longer have this option. Therefore, although the pizza is still pretty good, it just isn't same.   Moreover, now that they don't have this option, their menu looks somewhat sparse. Yes they have a diverse amount of pizzas still, and an okay number of pastas, but they really don't have much else. Also while their pastas are good, they are simply too expensive for the portions that they give you.  Overall Amore is okay, but nothing great anymore."}
{"text":"Service Nothing was BAD but nothing was GOOD either. This restaurant looks nice on the inside and outside, it is even located in a busy area (Yonge and Eglinton) but why is everything so mediocre? We had a group of 20+ individuals so they had our party sit upstairs on the second floor. Holy cow this place is small, we barely had any room but I'll blame that on the structure of the table/seats. It would have been better if they saved the table beside us as well so we could move around (I mean we had a large party and you know tips are already included) but I'm sure they had to maximize their venue. Obviously with such a big group it would take some time for all of us to order, but could they not offer us some bread first? Another thing is paying took forever. Could the restaurant not have more than 1 server to speed up the process? Also, our waiter offered us cheese after our meals were half finished. Like......what?  Food Looks pretty good once again but the taste is not worth its price. First of all the bread was just laying on some table (for I don't know how long) so it was not warm. I've had better bread at Chinese bakeries that sell sausage buns lols. The olive oil was disgusting - thick and smelled like plastic (I'm just trying to say it was too bleh). My friend noted that the mussel were too sour. Our soup came late and was depressing, even Campbell Soup would give it a thumbs down. The soup costed us $6-7, not only was the bowl size small but it had almost no taste. The main dish was so disappointing, the chicken tasted like it came defrosted from frozen food. Sure, the food would be okay if they costed half its price but at $20+.......no lols."}
{"text":"We were here for our friend's birthday this past weekend and thought this was a definite 3*  Ambience is dated (80s cheesy Italian), service was good, location is superb and my carbonara had the most bacon i've ever seen in my Life.  I LOVE bacon, but this may have been a little crazy! there was  at least a half pack of bacon in there.  I also thought there would be a raw egg on top of the carbonara which i could have mixed it in myself, but nope. i'd have liked that better  i also had the calamari which was ok, the antipasto platter which was ok.   their desserts are from Dufflet. I recognized the Butterscotch nut pie immediately since i was addicted to it earlier this year."}
{"text":"It doesn't look much from outside, but open the door and you step into an elegantly cozy double-decker Italian restaurant.   Large menu. If you don't have the patience or the stamina to study the whole thing, throw a dart at the pizza portion....you can't go wrong. Pasta dishes are your \"safe\" bet too; they know how to do pasta, my fav is fettuccine di mare in garlic olive oil.   +++ fresh food, excellent value  - - - don't take reservation except for large parties"}
{"text":"Was so good! Got pasta, pizza, dessert and a drink. Spilt it with a friend and it was $30 with a tip"}
{"text":"Wow, was this bad! I work in hospitality and the lacklustre experience of my brunch was atrocious, their tightly confined seating in this restaurant was reminiscent of a sardine can when they forced everyone into the front section leaving less than a foot and a half between tables, romantic?   The flavourless food really didn't help them either and neither did the poor service. It was clear that they bought pre sliced meat and didn't really know anything about smoked salmon or eggs or that hollandaise should taste like something and not be a watery mess.  The bumbling staff made me nuts, failing to clear tables, bring food, refills, bills or anything in a timely fashion was insulting. There was four of them and none of them seemed like they wanted to work together or get anything done except to have sour looks on their faces.  I couldn't imagine coming back to this place and reminds me of other pretentious, overrated restaurants on the danforth. Seriously needs an overhaul, hopefully their dinner/lunch is better but I won't risk trying it any time soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a friend on Sat. Restaurant was quiet for the neighbourhood.  There were barely any customers and we came almost near lunch time. Service was good (I guess when it's quiet, you would get better service). Food on the other hand was rather disappointing. I got one of the omelettes but the egg part seemed a bit dry. Also had some orange marmalade that might have been expired because I had an upset stomach for the rest of the day! Makes me wonder how fresh their ingredients are when they don't have many customers...Waiter also didn't know how to split the bill and ended up asking us to calculate using our phones. Prob won't return for brunch seeing there are so many other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Ugh, this place is just so good.   Think extensive wine list, endless pasta and pizza options on the menu, decadent desserts on offer.   Think minestrone soup with fresh spinach, potato, carrot and tomato brother with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.   Amazing.   My husband and I have been here twice and it has been a great experience both times. Everything feels so fresh and delicious and although the servers are a bit on the surly side, the food speaks for itself.   Love this place. Go!"}
{"text":"OMG?it was soooooo good!! Italian style steamed mussels--cozze,totally different with French one, used spring onion and tomato instead of shallots, drizzle with lemon then use the bread to suck all the juice~amazing~ My favorite is the seafood risotto?rich and creamy, but you still can taste all different flavor in it~ the last one is pasta de amore~ fantastic pasta, unlike other Italian restaurant make their pasta all red, full of tomato.. very light flavor brings out all the freshness in seafood. love it!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the the antipasti but the main course \"seafood risotto\" could have been much better - small portion size and looked overdone"}
{"text":"It was such a lovely day that the friend and I decided to look for a resto with a patio in the 'hood. What we found was Amore.  The host greeted us with a warm smile and sat us on the patio within minutes. Our server came soon after to take our drink orders. The decor of Amore is nice and the serving staff are well-dressed, which makes you feel that you're at a legitimate establishment (not to say that Amore is some shady joint).  We both ordered a fritatta (an open-faced omelette). I can't speak for my friend so I'll review only what I ate. As it was 11 AM, I decided to go for an item from the brunch menu - tomatoes, feta cheese, and basil leaf fritatta. With my order came potatoes and three pieces of baguette. I was impressed as when I order egg entrees, it usually doesn't sit well with me after due to it being quite greasy. The coffee wasn't amazing, but wasn't terrible - the person who made it must have gone to the same barrista college as myself.   The pricing wasn't outrageous, which is always a good thing. Another positive was that the waiting time for our food was minimal. A server came once in a while to see if I needed my coffee mug filled.  All in all, I would like to come back again. Now that's amore!"}
{"text":"Ok place for brunch or lazy breakfast Not outstanding food not rushed either though Being going off and on for years Not as good as it used to be though Coffee could do with improvement Nice atmosphere, decor ok.  Try it and see what you think!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful local find.  It hadn't been my first choice in the neighbourhood because I thought other restaurants in the area had better ambiance looking in from the street, but after a recommendation by a friend we tried it and it was lovely.  My server was impeccable - polite, friendly, checked in at all the right times.  The house red is well-priced and not at all bad.   The caesar salad is very creamy, which I like, and the pizzas were delicious.  I had a margherita and my partner had the Siena (with bacon!) - perfectly done, great crust.  I highly recommend for an easy (perhaps weekday) dinner out!"}
{"text":"Real wood fired Neopolitan pizzas in a quaint setting with a large menu."}
{"text":"I have come many times with my boyfriend or his family (they love it). Personally, I find it just okay. I have always been happy with their breakfast..especially the french toast or the waffles :) However, I have also tasted their pizza,soup and pasta..it was just okay.  The one dish I really enjoyed was the Asiago and Red Pepper Stuffed Chicken Breast,but it was a special and not on the regular menu.   They have a small front patio that looks very inviting in the summer. The service is always good, the owner seems to always be there. The biggest problem is that it is just too crowded, and on a busy day its unbearably tight."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive service that wasn't overbearing. Intimate spot that's great for dates or casual dining. Delicious food that to me, is authentically Italian. Great location, vast menu that offers lots of choices. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Decided to go out for dinner on Mother's Day on Sunday with a friend and her 5 year old son. We noticed there was not a big line up and decided to try this restaurant as the more popular restaurants were booked. We were asked how many people and if we had reservations and I told the owner that it was for 3 with no reservations. There was another couple and their 2 young boys behind us that also did not have reservations. The owner told the couple with their 2 kids a table was available and seated them upstairs. We would have left but it was Mother's Day and it was already late. Another server told us they were setting up a table and I asked him why the couple with the 2 kids were seated before us and since he was not aware of the situation I told him what happened. He spoke to the owner and confirmed that he had seated them ahead of us and apologized and said he didn't know why it happened. I told him that it was discrimination that they were Caucasian and we were Asian as the owner did not have the decency to apologize to me directly but in passing as we were being seated. The server tried to offer a free drink but we don't drink and seated us at the front of the restaurant instead of the crowded table near the kitchen as originally planned and gave us a free house salad to make up for it. We ordered the seafood fettuccine and it was pretty bland and tasteless and the pizza was nothing special and soggy instead of crispy. I would not go there again and surprised they have been in business this long."}
{"text":"I woke up last Sunday with an intense desire to have brunch. I never have these cravings nor do I do brunch. I am an early riser and tend to have a fruit smoothie, like a I regularly do, for breakfast. But I decided to indulge this unusual taste and headed to Yonge & Eglinton to find a brunch spot.  I chose Amore because it had a table free in its patio. I ordered the French toast. I've made these exact French toasts at home with the egg cooked and spread throughout the bread. It was delicious. The whipped butter was soft and rich - something I could never achieve. The right amount of syrup in its toy sterling silver serving dish to the side.  I ordered tea and was left unimpressed. It was Lipton tea. Packaged milk & cream containers.  But the service was phenomenal. I had a young, peppy, good looking server. He made sure I had hot water in my tea pot. He came to check on me on several occasions while never being intrusive. Overall, he was attentive without being intrusive. He seemed happy to be doing his job. He did a fantastic job! I only wished I could have taken him home with me!"}
{"text":"At Amore Trattoria, one will find the standard Italian fare. Anti-pasti, pasta, pizza, and a lot of wine. I went in a group of 4 for a fairly early dinner, around 5pm. The place wasn't too busy but I saw a wood fire oven and was excited for pizza.  Upon being seated we were given a menu... a VERY large menu. I watch the Food Network and see Gordon Ramsey cut a menu into a quarter of what it once was. Now I completely understand why. I was so overwhelmed by the different choices I couldn't choose! Indecisiveness is a weakness of mine when it comes to food.  So many pastas and so many pizzas! We each sat there for a good 20 minutes debating on what to get. And we were hungry! People started filing in while we scanned the menu. The server knew everyone by first name so I assume they are all regulars. This is a small restaurant and is filled with 20 or so people who are all regulars! I started to get excited about this place. I spied to see what they ordered. Every one of them ordered pasta. This started to sway my order towards the pasta. If the regulars get it, it has to be good right?  Luckily we all finally finished choosing and ordered. In came a grilled vegetable anti-pasti and grilled calamari didn't take long. The antipasti was grilled, drizzled with olive oil and freezing cold. I think it was stored in the fridge. The vegies didn't taste freshly grilled, freshly oiled, or freshly anything. They were served on a lackluster bed of mixed greens. The grilled calamari was over cooked, stringy, chewy, and also served on a bed of mixed greens.  For my main, I ordered the linguine with artichoke, spinach, zucchini, and tomatoes with garlic olive oil. It came in a gigantic pasta bowl, big enough to serve 2. The flavors were wonderful but it was heavy on the oil and felt greasy. The pasta was also a tad overcooked. It was good but nothing outstanding. I began to regret my change of heart and wished I had ordered the pizza.  The prices were really good and the portions were huge. The quality of food left more to be desired but at a price of $13 for a gigantic pasta bowl that's made fresh I feel I got my money's worth.   While seated there was a take out order for pizza.... thin crust, looked very good. If I come back I would definitely have to try the pizza. IF I come back.   The service was ok. It was quick and accommodating but there was just no heart. Not mean but not happy. Just there doing his job and not really outgoing, even towards the regulars.   The decor was simple. Traditionally styled Italian bistro minus the vinyl red and white checkerboard table cloths. Instead it was a simple white table cloth with white paper on top. Dark wood chairs, tan tile, wood bankets, and a gorgeous wood fire oven.  Overall, I had a decent experience, for the neighborhood and quality of food the price point is amazing. Even the drinks are cheap. Food was good but left a lot to be desired. I had a good meal but it wasn't memorable. There are other Italian bistros within the same block (Grazie). If it's too busy then come here."}
{"text":"This review is for delivery pizza...we received a menu in the mail and decided to give'r a shot. And we weren't terribly impressed, particularly with the Valentino pizza (goat cheese, spinach, prosciutto, green olives). It just wasn't very good at all. Sorry Amore! (But the tiramisu was delish)"}
{"text":"I thought this was a very good Italian restaurant. There are so many to choose from in the Yonge and Eglinton area, it can be hard to find a good one. What makes this restaurant unique is the wood fire oven.  You have to try their pizzas here. It's thin crust, lots of toppings and perfect for 1 person. I went here with my girlfriend and the restaurant were very accommodating for couple. We ordered 2 main courses to share, and they conveniently split the dinners for each of us (sounds simple, but not many places do that).   The service was quick and polite. The food did not take long to come out, and there was plenty of space for couples and small groups. This place is not cramped, and patio looks really nice too.  It's not expensive and the food is great. I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Came here honestly because grazie was closed and la vecchia was packed! Food was mediocre at best with service being sub-par.  When I asked the waitress for more bread she told me to just wait till others who didn't get bread were served first.  Weird answer and kinda out if place since I saw their stash quite full.  I think their crowd was luckily from other more popular restaurants being full.  They didn't seem to know how to handle the larger crowd.  Also the multiple sneezing and coughing was totally unappealing along with the waiter that served the pizza that got water (from his cleanup tray) spilt on.  Gross!  I hope that wood burning oven burns off the bacteria in case the customer had herpes.  I know....I'm being extreme but even McDonald's would throw that s$&$;&(;62 out."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for a late dinner as a group of 4. Overall enjoyed the dinner. Service was decent and prices are okay, too. Started with warm bread served with oil and vinegar. We ordered calamari to share which unfortunately was not good - it was really dark-coloured and tasted burnt - almost as if the oil needed to be changed in the deep fryer. In hindsight we should have sent it back, none of us enjoyed it. I had pizza as my main and really like it. It was one of the options with tomatoes, chicken and arugula. Overall was a decent dinner but just seemed a little inconsistent - I think I'd pick one of the other Italian restaurants in the area next time."}
{"text":"I always liked this restaurant but I have to admit I did not try a lot of different things from the menu. Long story short if you like carbonnara this is the place to go. They have decent price beer and is in a great location. The staff is friendly but nothing special. My friend always get their pizzas and can't get enough! If you're in the mood for some simple Italian dishes this is the place.!"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times for lunch for OpenTable. Happy with the experience both times. Good seating, service, and atmosphere for small groups to chat and eat in comfort. The Eggs Benedict were good and I'd be happy to come back again."}
{"text":"I came here with my partner for a light dinner and ordered grilled eggplant, artichokes and the olives as my \"choose-three\" antipasti appetizer. Compared with other Italian places I'd been to, it plain sucked.  It seemed like it'd been sitting around for a while and did not taste fresh.    The capallini also did not impress me at all, as it was overcooked and done rather carelessly.  Echoing Jay's review, the staff here seem to be dragging themselves a bit and weren't keen on cracking a smile.  They were polite and served everything as we needed though.  I probably won't come back here knowing that there are better choices downtown."}
{"text":"Ordered online a margarita pizza and penne al la vodka. I have ordered from here as it is nearby and never had any issues.  This time my pizza was not warm and the basil was so small and very minimal that I could hardly taste it. Very disappointed in this pizza. When there's only three toppings on a pizza you would think you should taste them all. The penne al la vodka was good - no issues."}
{"text":"Cool little place to grab brunch. Their dinner items sound delicious as well, but I can't seem to get past ordering breakfast/lunch items. Right now I'm stuck on re-ordering the waffles, different toppings every time and all so good."}
{"text":"Calamari Fritti had soft delicate batter and a delicious garlic dipping sauce. It could use more salt, but I was satisfied.  I had the daily special - Pesce and it had a very nice lime avocado butter sauce on Alaskan Plaice and rice. It was tasty - really soft and smooth, a good pairing of a light fish with avocado."}
{"text":"My previous review explained my dismay about this place:   * Wine that had been left opened for several days * Rancid olive oil on the table * Mediocre food  The positive things: pasta and garlic bread.  Even after a disappointing visit, I decided to give them another chance with their wood-fired pizzas.   Today's lesson: having a wood oven doesn't mean you know how to make good pizza! The pizza crust was thin and soggy. You can't pull a single piece out of the box without it falling apart.  When I called, I asked if there was a delivery minimum or delivery charge. She said the delivery charge was $1.99. I assumed that meant there was no delivery minimum. I asked the total: just under $20. If there was a delivery minimum, you would assume that 1. their terrible website would display it; or 2. they would mention it on the phone--they had several chances (when I initially asked if there was one, and when I asked what the total was). She also hung up on me when I was mid-sentence. And I'm not soft-spoken either so either she heard me and didn't care or was in a rush. I was asking when I could expect it. I figure it can't be too long, and I'm sure she was in a rush so I got over it. She was probably more socially awkward than rude.  The pizza arrives pretty quickly. After paying and tipping, the guy tells me that next time there's a delivery minimum of $25 (my order came to $20). I said that I asked the woman on the phone and she didn't mention anything. He said that there is a delivery minimum and that it was on the website. I told him I looked at the website when ordering and that it wasn't there. He insisted that it was on the website. I insisted that it wasn't. He again insisted that it was, so I decided to end it there and said \"now I know for next time\" so that the argument would end. As if there would be a next time. Did that really just happen? How unprofessional.  As if you'd even know what's on your website. No one's touched that thing since 2008 (though it looks like it's more from 1998).  I have provided a screenshot of their \"lovely\" delivery page that does not display that there is a delivery minimum (in case they decide to change it all of a sudden): http://cl.ly/1k1H3Z1n270T0V2L3B42  Here's the actual link: http://www.amoretrattoria.ca/?page=delivery  I will never spend a dime at their store again for the following reasons: * Extremely rude customer service: you don't hang up on your customer (I got over that one), you don't argue with them about a delivery minimum (especially when you're wrong).. smart to do it after I tipped him though, I wanted to take the tip back... * Soggy pizza that falls apart and tastes cheap. Cheap mozzerella, and if the chicken was grilled it was either done so several days ago or in a factory. * Really old wine if you order by the glass. so disgusting I refused to get it. * RANCID (no word of a lie) olive oil sitting on the table. Go ahead... Go there and taste it and tell me I'm wrong. It isn't rancid by a week or so either, try months or years.  The cons definitely outweigh the pros. There is no shortage of good Italian restaurants in the city. Even La Vecchia up the road is better.  These people deserve 1 star for having low quality food that probably won't pass a health check (e.g. rancid olive oil), several day old wine, soggy pizza that falls apart, and the worst being the rude and unprofessional customer service.   Coles Notes: I knew the food was mediocre from the first time around and that they were terrible in some domains (rancid olive oil, days-old wine) but I decided to give them a try anyway because they have a wood burning stove, to be disappointed yet again with their soggy pizza, and then arguing with the delivery guy..  \"Amore\" means love... Based on all the Yelp reviews I wonder how successful I'd be at launching a class action suit against them for false advertising. This community definitely has no amore for Amore!   I guess \"Old Wine, Rancid Olive Oil, Soggy Pizza and Bad Service Trattoria\" won't sell as well...!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday at 1:30pm, expecting wholesome italian food. We were quite disappointed. My husband ordered a pizza and I ordered a pasta. They come with sides of salad. However, there was more salad than the food itself and the food itself was very mediocre. The pasta with basil was lacklustre and the pizza was not favourful. The waiter was not knowledgeable about the wines and we did not get what we were looking for. Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"It's fascinating - had I read the mixed reviews here before my friend and I stopped in, I wouldn't have gone. And I'd have been wrong.  We decided to stroll Yonge & Eg on a Sunday around noon looking for a place for brunch. She'd suggested a few greasy spoons further up the way, when I saw the \"brunch Saturdays & Sundays\" sign in the window.  The Brie & Asparagus crepe on the menu outside screamed at me, and she was simarly called by the Pesto & Sundried Tomato frittatta.   We went in and were invited to seat ourselves at the table of our choice - something I always appreciate, not being used as window dressing to entice passersby: \"It must be a good restaurant, there are customers!\"   The waitress was prompt, coolly efficient if not overly friendly, and if there were any specials or recommendations we never heard 'em. We only drank water but our water glasses were refilled at least twice, and never allowed to go completely empty.  The crepe & frittata were, with tax, $24. That's not obscene for brunch for two people, there was ample enough food that we both left quite full, and we both QUITE enjoyed the meals.   Were they the best we'd ever had? No.   Were they good enough that we both made note to come back?  Heck yeah."}
{"text":"Wull niy come back. Salty not cooked pasta. Drank 4 glasses of water to force the food down. Pricing was okay."}
{"text":"I ordered the Prosciutto antipasti for an appetizer and the Vitello Parmigiana (Veal Parmesan) entree.  The prosciutto was good, though a bit tough. But you can't go wrong with cured ham, asiago cheese and melon. The fruit was especially sweet so this was a satisfactory appy. The veal was less interesting. The marinara sauce was a bit bland, and the meat tough which always surprises me with veal (the whole point is that this is a tender meat). However Amore was generous with the cheese and sauce, and the bread pairing.  Overall, this worked in a moment of desperate craving for Italian food, but it's nothing I would recommend or try again."}
{"text":"Reccomended for a mature croud.  Italian little restaurant. Amazing Wood oven gourmet pizzas & delicious pastas. Personally I did not think the staff was friendly, he was pretty rude.  *Floating black stuff in our water- Ew..  BRUNCH SATURDAY & SUNDAY 10:30a.m. to 3:00pm!  DO DELIVERYS,CATERING,PRIVATE PARTIES +MORE!"}
{"text":"Having recently moved to the area, I'm slowly going down all the restaurants up Yonge Street. This was maybe our 5th or 6th one, and by far the worst dinner experience.  We ordered a bottle of sparkling water, caprese salad, and 2 pastas - a daily special with red sauce and lamb sausage (rigatoni) and the Chiara, which was rigatoni, pesto cream sauce, shrimp, sundried tomoatoes and artichoke.  Upon arriving to the restaurant, the waitress wasn't very inviting. It wasn't that busy - 2 tables in side, 3 out, plus us arriving - and she shortly told us we could seat ourselves. We did, and then felt vey rushed to order. We were also informed we could not share a dish without paying the sharing cost, which I've only heard of once in my life at a high end Vegas restaurant.  The Caprese was decent, and the highlight of the meal. It wasn't very traditional, and the tomatoes and bocconcini came on top of a green salad mix. There was also no fresh basil, just some pesto on top of each cheese slice. Refreshing, and for $7.50 - meh.  My friend's rigatoni with lamb was not very appetizing. The red sauce tasted like it came from a jar and the sausage wasn't that great, either. The fusili, though better, was barely on par with what you'd expect at The Pickle Barrel. Tasty at first, but got increasingly annoying to eat. The artichokes were disgusting, mushrooms slimy, and basically the entire worlds supply of sundried tomatoes.   Another big taste difference was the fact that the pasta was obviously not made on-site. La Vecchia and Spacco are 2 of the best meals I've had in a LONG time (and both DO make their own pastas). I highly recommend either on the same block, particularly because all 3 are around in the same price point (Spacco has pricer appetizers, but entrees at all 3 are basically on par).  If the entrees were lower priced, perhaps I'd be more forgiving. And by lower priced, I mean maybe the $8-11 range. Overpriced for what you get, not the nicest room, and bad service.  Skip Amore, there's better food inches away."}
{"text":"Service was great. The Amore pizza is probably the most authentic and delicious pizza I've ever had. It is so yummy. I wish I could eat there every day."}
{"text":"Kinda tacky. Not really authentic Italian. Place was clean. Friendly but very basic service. Food was average at best. I had the White Bass which was OK but portion wasn't great. My fiancée has the carbonara; sauce was bland and while there was ample bacon there were no scallions / onions or anything else to jazz it up. The wood-fired pizza menu was fairly long, so maybe that's their strong suit? The only bright spot for us was the prices; it was rather inexpensive for a restaurant in the Yonge & Eglinton area, but we would have happily paid more for better quality."}
{"text":"Place is stuck in 1995. Diner dishes, paper table covers, and service that matches the milk in plastic cups. Serving wilted lettuce, and bland food. Definitely won't come back."}
