{"text":"Took my kids here for first time this morning. In a word - Yummy!  Fresh, warm, wonderful donut flavor and textures. Cooked and made in front of you. Outside texture slightly crunchy with fluffy cake center.  Wonderful customer service as we were greeted when we walked in by a very nice lady (owner?) who took my kids under her wing and showed them the ropes. Great concept and thoroughly enjoyable product. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this donut shop! Always hot donuts and every frosting and topping you could want!!"}
{"text":"So not worth the hype. 
Found the glazes and toppings looking rather gross.  Not fresh looking with toppings spilled and not clean.
The doughnuts looked nothing like the pictures and were just ok.  Not worth the price."}
{"text":"What a wonderful idea....fresh made to order donuts ! However there were no vegan options :( , so I didnt get to try any but my mom and son did. They got a pumpkin spice donut and a bluberry one....they were not impressed at all...very disappointed ! 

I got an iced herbal tea that didnt taste good at all, so bitter I couldn't drink it , my son got one of their frozen fruit drinks that was severly fake and sugared filled, he didnt even like it nor finush it either and mom got a plain coffee....no one was happy here and probably wont go back BUT the idea is cool and if you are a lover of donuts you probably should check it out and see for yourself! 

The girls were nice and helpful and the place was very clean too so I hate to leave such a bad review but if I am spending money I want to ensure its good food and drink going in my belly, ya know what Im sayin ??"}
{"text":"So I was ready for my morning coffee and bagel...
Unbeknown to me, I stepped into not your average donut store...
It was pretty cool to see the store layout and the Gizillion Glazes and Trillion Toppings u could pick from.
I had maple glaze w bacon topping.
Taste: 

Donut: OK, not bad but not one of the best...

Glaze: pretty good too bad it's too runny my bacon DIDNT STICK (by the time it's about 2.5978 inches from my mouth 70% of the bacon already fell off, by my second bite 98.76536% of the bacon fell- I Cry!)

Topping: bacon is always good!!!' :) 

Iced coffee-light blend: umm if the standard for good are peets coffee and dutch coffee  then this is an OK, a tad too sour for me. 

Conclusion: will be back to show out of towners crazy things u could find in AZ."}
{"text":"Take them to go if you must, but dig in and enjoy ASAP 'cause these things come out tasty, hot, crisp, and decadent.  Like fair donuts without all the other yucky smells surrounding you.  I describe this place as Design-Your-Own-Donut to people because you can choose your own glaze (and there are dozens of choices) and toppings.  But mostly these are just awesome because they come out fresh, hot and soooo tasty."}
{"text":"Probably the best doughnut I've ever had. Can't go wrong with any flavor because the doughnuts are made on site as you order it."}
{"text":"The best donut! I loved Krispy Kreme but now there is fractured prune! The best hot donut, u pick topping and addiction! 

It's fun to watch the donuts made in front of you."}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect when I first walked in but I was more than pleasantly surprised by the total awesomeness of how they actually tasted!! The Bacon Bomb is amazing!!!  My inner fatty is going to regret finding this shoppe!!!  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"You bite into a hot doughnut with melted icing that is just a little taste of heaven.  I love making my own doughnut and it\"s exciting to taste my created doughnut.  Then again you can never go wrong with a doughnut.  My only critique is the bacon is soft instead of crispy."}
{"text":"I love this place! The apple pie doughnut is my favorite. It's fun that they make it right in front of you and it's super fresh!"}
{"text":"We all had a doughnut craving so we headed to Fractured Prune, which is extremely close to my house. I had heard rave reviews about the place. At work, I heard people talking about how amazing it was to create your own doughnuts. I also went on yelp, and again encountered highly positive feedback.

When I went to the store, it was totally empty. It was a ghost town. There were only 2 employees- one behind the counter and one sitting and eating doughnuts with a date (?) Anyways, the employee behind the counter explained the idea behind the place and we got to ordering. He took quite a while to make the doughnuts, and watching him make them was sort of painful to be honest. Didn't seem like he quite knew what he was doing. 

We ordered a dozen doughnuts- one cherry, one orange, two lemonades, three salt caramels, and the rest plain glazed. The doughnuts were fresh and warm, and also pretty to look at. But that's about it.

When I finally bit into a doughnut, I realized a GLARING problem. The texture of the doughnut was all wrong. It was the texture of those packaged powdered doughnuts you get at Walmart. There's a reason I don't buy those. The only flavors I found edible were sea salt caramel and honey glazed. The fruit glazes were strong and artificial tasting, which is inedible in my case. Why eat a doughnut that doesn't even taste good? 

To be honest, I don't understand the hype about this place. The concept is good, but the doughnuts are terrible. I feel like the only reason people like this place is the fact that you can put bacon bits on your doughnuts. And I don't even eat bacon. So there's really nothing here for me.

The worst part about this experience is that I STILL have a doughnut craving that has not been satisfied at the slightest. I guess I'll be driving over to Bosa doughnuts later today for some cheap, delicious, fresh doughnuts."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for my 91-year-old grandmother, who is obsessed with Fractured Prune (except that she always calls it the Split Prune and Dirty Plum). She raves to me all the time about the quality of the baked goods and how interesting and unique the doughnuts are. She tells me that they are by far the best she has ever had. I wish I lived close to her so that I could join her in her Fractured Prune adventures. Hopefully that day will come soon, but until then I will happily convey her raving review on her behalf.  And I figured that it must be truly amazing if such an experienced lady loves this place so much!"}
{"text":"11,628 Flavor combinations from 19 glazes and 14 toppings. How can you possibly go wrong? We purchased 1/2 dozen of their favorites (pics to follow).

The donuts were exceptionally warm and delicious; probably would've been the bomb dot com had I eaten them right then and there. Not that they weren't hood when I got home, simply knowing that they are ALWAYS warm makes me drool with anticipation of eating one freshly dipped. Mmmm! 

The place is rather clean and bright. A nice sized flat screen tv adorns the wall in the dining area, and the patio (though not going to be inviting in the upcoming months) will be a cool ticket on those beautiful Fall, some Winter, and Spring days. Do we even have Fall here in AZ? Lol.

The staff was very pleasant. The ONLY downfall are the prices. $1.89 for 1 donut! Holy cow! Its a regular sized cake donut. Nonetheless, you gotta pay for good food, right?

For all you really nice people who adore your fellow office coworkers (or not), they do have a \"Corporate Card\" that lends $2 off if you buy 2 dozen donuts. And a free dozen if you purchase 5 dozen...all must be purchased at the same time. Nothing fancy smancy, but at $1.89 each every damn penny counts!"}
{"text":"4 stars because the donuts are 5 stars and the coffee is two stars...at best.  The donuts are amazing, made to order for the glaze and topping and when they are warm they are omfg delicious. I ordered a coffee style donut and one with bacon, and they were both mouthwatering good. Even thinking about them now I can't help but salivate.

The coffee on the other hand...is a complete let down. I'd suggest going next door to a gas station for coffee that is equally good or better. 

Overall I'll definitely come back for donuts time and again."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed out first visit to the Fractured Prune. The kids loved picking out there own glazes and toppings, the adults enjoyed it too!! It was great being able to watch your donuts created right before your eyes. We will definitely be returning. You can't beat a hot and fresh donut in the morning. 

They have a great little sitting area out back. Some of the tables are setup on a lower level, allowing plenty of space for the kids to run around and burn off all that sugar they had just devoured. 

The only thing I will say is that the prices are higher then other local donut places but we expected that when we heard we would be able to design our very own donut creation! Definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!  And also a fun experience no matter what age you are.  There are so many flavor choices, so you can be creative and make your own combination or choose from the menu options (all which sounded amazing).  The doughnuts are a cake doughnut so they are richer and more filling than a Krispy Kreme doughnut, which is good because you don't need to eat a bunch of them to get full.  I had 1 1/2 and was happily stuffed!  If you are taking some home for the family and don't want to leave Fido out, you can ask for a \"doggy doughnut\" and then everyone in the family is included in the fun!"}
{"text":"The donuts are amazing.  The staff, not so much.

I took my kids here for an after school treat yesterday evening.  There was one employee manning the shop, and he was completely overwhelmed with the crowd. But that didn't stop him from fiddling with his phone! He scooped raw donut batter into the hopper while fiddling with his phone, then changed his gloves and fiddled with his raw dough-smeared phone as he put toppings on donuts. And my debit card was covered with sticky crap when he handed it back to me.  I was so revolted I should have walked out, but I had 2 excited little kids with me who nearly cried when I tried to leave.  Lord help us if we get a foodborne illness from the grossness at this store."}
{"text":"Checked this place out today in preparation for our daughter's 2nd bday party. Donuts were amazing! Donuts aren't big but that's ok...allows you to try more flavors without all the guilt ;) can't wait to get them for her party!"}
{"text":"A must try. Made-to-order custom donuts. Amazing! The donuts are warm and incredibly soft and the glazes are flavorful. When you enter you are greeted by friendly staff on how to create and order the donuts. This is a very family oriented establishment and has a fun and energetic environment. You'll have a great experience."}
{"text":"For now one star because they close at 2pm EVERYDAY I can understand on Sunday's but really? I'll probably never try it because I work. I'll update this when I do find time to try it."}
{"text":"Simply good! Tried the Pina colada, maple bacon,  strawberry shortcake,  and Blueberry. All good but my fave is a toss-up between strawberry and Pina colada. The donuts are made fresh to order so they are hot when you get them.  They have a slight crunch on the outside and fluffy inside.  Not too heavy or dense,  which is good.  The iced coffee is great (city roast). Atmosphere is clean and relaxed.  Friendly service. Will be back to try more :)"}
{"text":"WOW!  Seriously the best donuts ever.  Should be featured on Guy's Donuts, Drive-ins and Dives!   A client brought my staff 2 dozen to say thank you, and all of us were in love!   

I have told at least a dozen people and posted on my FB!  Absolutely the best, who can do any other donut now."}
{"text":"Man - I don't know a lot about donuts. Like, people bring donuts in to work and talk about which ones are better than other ones, and I know there are different kinds of donuts, but I've never really cared about the whole thing enough to learn any of that mess. Anyway that doesn't make a great case for why you should read my review, but I was here and ate the donuts, so don't be so critical.

Anyway let's break it down, yinz:
Price: You can get a dozen donuts for like, $15 or something like that, and there was a sign that said on Wednesday they were even cheaper.

Atmosphere: Dude this is a donut place. The kitchen is visible, and has a diner-like feel. The paint scheme and wallpaper make you think it's a tourist trap from the 80s, and they've got music going loud enough to be like, \"Thank you - I'm awake\" but not too loud that you can't carry on a conversation. They have a few tables but it looks like for the most part, people carry-out, as opposed to eating in.

Food: These donuts are freakin delicious. So they make them fresh - you can tell that because they make them right in front of you, and you can watch the entire process. They then give them one of a dozen glazes, and whatever you want from twice as many topping options. We got a dozen - all different, and they were pretty awesome. The donuts are perfectly soft inside, and just a tiny bit crisp on the outside, like you're eating an elephant ear at the fair or something. No - they don't have vegan options. It's a donut shop.

The Name: Why are they called 'The Fractured Prune'? I don't know. There's a story behind the counter that says why, but I got distracted and didn't read enough to know anything other than that there was a woman."}
{"text":"My company moved into a new building in Tempe yesterday and they treated us to donuts and coffee from Fractured Prune.  They were fabulous.  Not your usual boring flavors.  Very innovative and tasty.  Loved the Bold coffee too.  I hadn't heard of them before - but now that I have, I'll go back on my own."}
{"text":"Some of the best donuts I have ever tried! Magic is having them warm.. will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Fractured Prune is a DIY donut shop for those who are hoping to meet their yearly sugar allowance in one helping.  You start out with a vanilla cake donut and choose between numerous sugary glazes AND up to two sugary (or bacon-y) toppings.  I never really liked caked donuts, but I'll admit that I liked FP's donuts better than expected.  The donut itself was slightly crisp on the outside, and soft and warm on the inside.  The toppings were a different story; cloyingly sweet, to the point of not being able to taste anything other than...sweet.  We tried 4 different donuts, and they were all sweet, sweet and more sweet.  If I ever come back, I might just order mine plain.  Other than the taste of the donuts, the shop is very clean and attractive inside, the service friendly and it was cool to watch donut batter drop into the oil fryer and fry up into crispy-soft little donuts.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, these are more like dessert donuts, so if your diabetes-tooth is acting up and you're hankering for something REALLY sweet, Fractured Prune will do the trick!"}
{"text":"Nothing, but nothing, beats a hot cake donut.  My first hot donut was while I was in elementary school on a field trip down to Lewisburg Kansas, the famous Lewisburg Cider Mill.  I remembered for the longest time thereafter the fantastic hot donuts there topped w/ nothing more sophisticated than cinnamon & sugar.  I didn't have that same experience again until dining w/ my beloved @ a local BBQ eatery in IL shortly after college.  Well, about 20 yrs later I've once again found another outstanding hot donut.  Today I ordered the OC which was glazed w/ a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar.  2nd donut (& one donut is really sufficient) was a hot donut simply dipped in maple glaze.  Staff was friendly & helpful.  If making your first trip to this store I would encourage all newbies to eat that donut while still warm in lieu of boxing it up & leaving.  I know I don't have the self control to sit in my car w/ that aroma & not gobble it up before I really got to wherever I was headed.  ENJOY:)"}
{"text":"This place get one star for the pretty delicious donuts they sell but unfortunately for them customer service is terrible. They have very young tweens working there more worried about the latest gossip than the paying customers."}
{"text":"The donuts were amazing and very original, but somewhat over priced. This is the only place that I have ever been to that allows you to customize your own donuts with glazes and toppings, as well as offering such a wide variety of choices to begin with. Not only that, but they are so fresh, the dough is not even poured until you make your order and the donuts are then made in front of you, much like a sandwich at a subway restaurant! Awesome fresh, utterly tasty and unique, but questionable price tag at $1.95 per pastry."}
{"text":"They're honestly just THAT good. It's almost like a coldstone for donuts. If you love cake donuts this is the place to go."}
{"text":"If you like fresh hot cake donuts, this is the place. We had fun choosing our flavors and watching them make them. It was a minor disaster because we took our kids there and a fresh hot donuts is actually not the best idea for a two-year-old and a four-year-old who don't like crumbly or sticky things or waiting for things to cool. The people making the donuts did make a few mistakes in our order, but corrected them to the tune of several extra free donuts. The only bizarre one was that the sugar donut tasted salty instead of sugary."}
{"text":"I loved the BlackBerry cobbler!!! I was the most excited about the Blueberry but it was a little much for me. Doughnuts came out hot and fresh but they are a fun concept more then supreme flavor. Great for what they are."}
{"text":"Best dounts around Ruth was great so clean APlus they can make you anything in the world you can imagine"}
{"text":"Dude.  Wow.  Okay, the review.  Assuming you really enjoy sweet and rich, these donuts are exceptional.  And they are a unique experience- nothing like other typical donuts.  Made when you order them, super heavy and rich and sweet.  Lots of interesting flavor combinations already on the menu, or you can customize your flavor combinations.  If you're looking for a light and fluffy donut, this isn't your spot.  Otherwise, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Nice place and fancy design. The doughnuts taste great, cooked fresh and soft for people to eat. They have a similar concept as Krispy Kreme (good marketing idea). The only problem was that the price for the donuts were more expensive than I had imagined. Definitely not cost efficient, but overall not too shabby!"}
{"text":"A truly gourmet doughnut experience. Smells wonderful. Doughnuts are made before you. Feels like a California establishment including price. I give 3 stars because they don't do gluten free, and combos are super sugary and a bit messy. I think they have established themselves as a high end spot so why not indulge us spoiled people and those who are sensitive to wheat?  However my husband and kids don't care a prune about GF. We literally had to stop going because they are so decadent and shouldn't be a habit unless you want to weigh a ton and have diabetes. It is a sugarfest. A great rare treat. Sure to be a hit if you bring to a party or meeting. The combos are amazing. There is also a \"Step and Repeat\" to give it a glamorous edge. The history of the name is posted. The coffee is strong and delicious. The workers are young, friendly."}
{"text":"I felt like I was having a diabetic attack. So sweet!! Be warned that this place is more of a dessert rather than the normal breakfast stop. Have only one unless you want the sugar jitters."}
{"text":"It lives up to the hype!  I had a sea salt caramel donut and it was excellent.  Husband had the sugar/cinnamon.  The sheer number of choices make this a little overwhelming, so we just ordered off their favorites menu. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The place was clean both in the customer area as well as behind the counter.  The restaurant idea is novel similar to a Subway or Chipolte. I ordered two different doughnuts and was unimpressed. Most any other shop is just as good if not better and considerably cheaper.   At an approximate two dollars per doughnut I expected much more."}
{"text":"These donuts are super fresh and the menu has a lot of really great options.  We got the coffee cake and salted caramel donuts.  I loved how fresh and warm they were.

Now the parts we didn't care for: the glaze is pretty thin, making it hard to get a lot of flavor out of each bite.  So all you really end up tasting is this delicious donut...with a hint of the flavor you ordered.  

It wasn't bad by any means, but I think more could be done to make the flavor more powerful.  I think I'll try it again, because maybe some of the other flavors would hit the spot! 

Cool place too!"}
{"text":"Normally I don't like cake donuts... these have flare and are quite good."}
{"text":"Nothing short of amazing! Everything is on point from the whole ordering process, watching the \"doughnut designer\" make your doughnuts, and the amazing employees!  I do have one complaint.....let me tip those amazing workers, they deserve it!  After the girl handed me my dozen doughnuts she then handed me another little box, she said the fresh made doughnuts had not turned out as big as they had wanted so she threw in a couple extra for free!  I went home opened the box and thought they looked fantastic, then I took a bite........WOW!  I will be back for more delicious doughnuts at the Fractured Prune!"}
{"text":"I havent been to the shop but someone brought my workplace these donuts and WOW! the toppings are great and even the donut itself without anything on it would be delicious. I heard about all the different things you can put on and can't wait to go there."}
{"text":"Holy hell, FANTASTIC!!! I'm NOT a doughnut guy, but thought I'd treat my team to some goodies on a friday. The whole concept is super customizable doughnuts. You walk in, and they usualy have order forms (today, it was just pen and paper) and you can choose pre selected creations or create your own with tons of glazes and toppings to choose from. I got a dozen alrady selected types, to make it easy. Truthfully ,they all looked great. They literally fry, then dip, then top  your doughnut fresh! YOu hand your list to the next doughnut person adn they get to work. it's pretty impressive. I got random ones that incliuded strawberry shortcake (strawberry glaze with graham cracker crumbs), Maple with Bacon, Prunellas Classic (awesome mixed berry glaze with powdered sugar), Smores (marshmallow glaze, chocolate chips and graham cracker crumbs) etc. They all looked great, and the ones I had were the two best doughnuts I've ever had. Hands down. Now it's a bit pricey ($16 per dozen) but WELL worth it. GREAT DOUGHNUTS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg! Where do I start?!?!? This place is literally sinful! Today's National Donut Day, so why not indulge is some amazing donuts?!?!? I've heard nothing but great things about Fractured Prune and chose today to see what all the hype was about! 

Honestly, I feel as though people did not do this place justice AT ALL!!!!! Okay, I'm getting ahead of myself..... 1. You walk in and there are flavors galore! You have the choice to choose one of the amazing menu recipes or you can create your own with all the base flavors and toppings! I was a bit overwhelmed with the selection and didn't know where to start!
2. There are order forms that you fill out to give the counter your order and quantity! Luckily they were fully staffed and I could ask everyone what they recommended! This is where the problem arose: I couldn't narrow my options! I got 4: French toast, salted caramel, cookies and cream and another one that was similar to the French toast one! Since its National Donut Day, you got a donut free with the purchase of a drink..... I wasn't even thirsty but what the heck why not! 

4 donuts and an apple juice later...... I made it home and the donuts were still HOT! They literally melt in your mouth WTH! Each one was better than the one before! I am a fan, but with a wedding coming up and swimsuit season already upon us..... I will need will power to be a fan from a far!"}
{"text":"Ok, i was really really craving donuts. ...so here i decided, being 8mo pregnant and really craving something memorable,  that i wanted to taste a few here. At 1.98 apiece, i figured they might be a bit special since I'm always hearing about this place from folks I follow on IG.
Anyyywayyyy, stopped by and the gentleman with the 'stache kindly explained to me, as a newbie, how it worked. So i went with the OC, the strawberry shortcake and the salted one. The batter for these cake donuts is pretty good and really, that's about as sweet as I'd like my donut. .add on the other toppings and i was just past enjoying them and kinda done with them after just a bite of each. The strawberry one was the least favorite of mine. .it was kinda yuck. The other two were more enjoyable but still very very sweet.
Honestly, i can't even think of which other ones I'd like to  try, none of the other  combos interested me :/
I'm glad i tried it, just to remove the mystery in my mind...  maybe I'm just not their target customer, too sweet sweet sweet for me."}
{"text":"Holy doughnuts!! This place has the best doughnuts.  So many combinations and flavors. The doughnuts themselves are crispy outside, soft and fluffy on the inside....So dlish. The banana cream was very yum. Getting to watch them cook was very interesting. 
We had a dozen doughnuts since we had a Groupon so we got to try a bunch of different glaze and topping combos.  
I only took down stars for the bad customer service. The two teenage girls gossiping and playing on their phones totally ignored is when we entered.  When we were ready to order it took a few min just to get their attention when she finally laxidazily came to the register she was not very friendly and there was no smile the entire time she was assisting us. Both girls made it seem like we were inconveniencing them. They definitely didn't appear to want to be there at all. Also on a note, the f-clair? (The oor that's supposed to be like an eclair) didn't have any Arizona cream in it...i am hoping to try it next time since they messed up the order. 
If it were not for the employees I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"Some of the best donuts I have ever had in my life and I love donuts. Fresh, fast and delicious. You can customize your donut to however you like and it comes out warm and so good. I can't even make a recommendation for a certain donut because they are all so tasty. (They are the cake type of donuts)"}
{"text":"Warm, fried-on-the-spot. This is donut heaven. We went with a group of friends and tried different combos, which I think Fractured Prune does best to breed creativity and try some amazing combinations."}
{"text":"As weird as it sounds, Fractured Prune has restored my faith in good donuts. I really liked the concept of being able to pick how you want your donut topped and was really happy that the execution was spot on. I stopped in with a craving for something chocolate-y so I went with the donut dipped in chocolate & topped with chocolate sprinkles. As much as I liked the chocolate, I actually was a huge fan of just the donut itself!

They have happy hour in the afternoon which I missed out on (didn't read the sign quick enough & wasn't allowed to add donuts after paying for the one). For $5, you get any 3 donuts; I'd be interested in going back to try other ones!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning treat taking my niece and her GF for the first time. Friendly associates throughout the shop even in the craze they all continue to smile. We got lemonade, strawberry shortcake, Oreo and the Prunella. The first couple bites are tasty, warm and not overly sweet but if you don't eat it right away there is an oily after taste. I only ate half of mine due to that after taste. Next time I'll share one so not to waste."}
{"text":"I love the concept of creating your own personalized donut.  They cook to order the donut, which is the good old fashioned heavy dough, then you select your glaze, then your topping!  Voila!  Your hot, fresh treat is ready to eat!  The staff is very friendly to boot!"}
{"text":"I had to see what the hype was about. I've seen friends post about their \"creative\" donuts online and I was getting jealous. I love donuts and I never knew this place existed. Sad thing, this place is less than half hour from my parents place. But I was determined not to miss out on the opportunity during this new year.

Yup, yup, yup lived up the hype! I was pretty overwhelmed about what to do when I walked in but I calmed down. Took the piece of paper and selected their favorite kinds of donuts. Next time, I will make my own! But for now, these donuts were delicious. Hands down some of the best I've ever had.

My piece of advice.. don't take it to go. Just eat there and enjoy the freshness! It was absolutely amazing. Do it!"}
{"text":"Was my first time coming here. Oh why havent i heard of this sooner?? I customized my own donut with honey glaze, cinnamon sugar and powdered. A bit more expensive than bosa but the experience is worth it. The donut comes out piping hot cause they make it right out of the oven. Best donut ever! Im a fan of sweets so it was the perfect amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"Typically, a yummy experience; however, Sunday's must not be the day to come for consistent, mouthwatering, one-of-a-kind donuts! Out of our six donuts, 5 were amazing. But the Bacon Bomb...that famous Bacon Bomb - was bad. COLD bacon on a hot donut??!! Not a good mix! 
The place was super clean. But today's service was less than friendly and the two employees seemed more interested in carrying on their coversation and making us wait. When we received our 6 donut order, we were missing one...the bacon bomb. The employee's facial expression seemed a bit bothered with the \"forgotten\" donut issue but he did get the donut to us fairly quick. Maybe that's why we had the ice cold bacon??!!?? 
Customers who showed up after we did were out the door with their donuts before we had ours. Perhaps, take out customers have preference??!!?? 
Oh well! Too delicious not to return, but today was strike one!"}
{"text":"I live in Tucson which is probably a good thing that Fractured Prune is 1 1/2 hours away.  I seriously love the doughnuts here.

I love the combinations they suggest but I also like that I can create my own.  

They are cake doughnuts and they are light and fluffy not heavy like some cake doughnuts tend to be. They are made to order so you will not have a stale doughnut and you can watch them make your custom doughnut in front of you!"}
{"text":"We loved it. They have a donut machine and they freshly fry your donuts. You can pick your toppings. They had some really good combos. It's just under 2 bucks a donut. Not cheap but really good and worth it. Just white cake donut but lots of toppings to choose from. We will be back."}
{"text":"i am going to preface this by saying I am a huge fan of cake donuts they are my favorite and I have never been in the store. So I cannot comment on their customer service, cleanliness of their store, and so on.

One of the managers at work bought 3 boxes of donuts and brought them in for us to try, all I will say is WOW adios diet these are amazing! I was being so good at resisting the donuts but everyone in the office kept saying \"This is the best donut I have ever had! You have to try one!\" and so on and so forth, finally I gave in to the peer pressure (I know I am weak, woe is me) and I tried one, there were only a few left so I had the Salted Caramel and sweet baby JESUS that was like Christmas in my mouth! I went NOM NOM NOM on that donut and didn't even feel bad for breaking my diet, now I need to go run for an hour to get rid of those calories. Totally worth it! In fact as I am typing this I want to get up and go get another donut...."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of cake doughnuts. I am going to start off with that. So when my coworker's wife brought these for our department to celebrate his birthday,  I avoided taking one. Until... I found out he saved one for me before everyone inhaled them. Well damn, I couldn't say no.

I took a deep breath and decided to take one for the team and take a bite. But hold up, this cake doughnut was different. It wasn't heavy dense dough. It was light and had yummy flavor. The glaze wasn't too sweet and the little chocolate chips on top weren't chalky, made by Satan to torture chocolate loving brown folks like myself. No, this was a good damn cake doughnut. 

I felt like I needed to apologize to him for avoiding this little piece of bliss he put away for me. This place is legit! 

I am now a fan of cake doughnuts. Only from this place though. Fractured Prune is my secret lover and the hubs is ok with that."}
{"text":"New donut spot in Chandler, with a unique spin, picture donuts ala Chipolte.

I hit FP on a Sunday morning, and was warmly greeted by an employee. They explained how to order and purchase your donuts, cool system. Basically they are all cake donuts, but you have a huge selection of glazes, and toppings.

The place is super clean and fun, and the service was very nice. Sadly the donuts have a very distinct and weird after taste, and I think it's an oil issue. I read other reviews that noted it, so I am not alone, it seems like something is odd about the oil after taste. I am a huge fan of donuts, and know them like a wine snob knows wine. With that being said, there are many people who swear by these things, so please give it a try. Based on the sweet people here alone, it's worth a trip. In the meantime maybe they will tweak the oil, or something. I wish this place all the best!"}
{"text":"They make them on the spot - can't get a fresher doughnut. We went on a Sunday afternoon and there was no line, so the wait was just a few minutes. They have a good list of options and then you can choose your own glaze and topping to get whatever you want. I'm not a doughnut guy, but I really liked this place and the doughnuts were great. Now I have to get up earlier to get to the gym to burn those doughnuts off. Thanks..."}
{"text":"New donut shop in chandler. Thought I would stop by, didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. Its basically a made to order donut place with many options for glaze and toppings. 

We walked in they gave us a quick orientation and said they have cake donuts, which i am not a big fan of in general but thought i would try anyways. Wow these suckers are good. I would say its a mix between a cake donut and a yeast donut. Warm, Soft with a slightly crispy outside. 

I tried 2 donuts: 
-The chocolate covered cherry which is red cherry glaze and little chocolate chips on top, very good and the donut was so warm it started melting the chips
-The orangsicle which is a orange glaze and powered sugar. Very good as well with nice bright orange flavor.

Will have to try to make my own creation next time and be adventurous.

The price is about $2 after tax for each a little pricey for the size of donut but they are made to order so not too bad.

Quick addition:

Stopped by to try two more donuts this time custom style:

-Key lime/ Sea salt -Bright green, Sweet tangy and tasty
-Maple/ Bacon -Perfect breakfast Donut, slightly sweet and savory salty with the bacon pieces

Rating still holds, great place for warm hot gooey goodness"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and I am not sure we will even be back.  I hate to give a bad review but I was not at all impressed with the donuts here.  They are made fresh to order which is very nice but they don't taste like that.  Almost like the oil they used was old because that's what the donuts tasted like.  They have a lot of options for flavours which is nice just wish they tasted better."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and it's great how you can choose your own toppings! Loved how the doughnuts were made on the spot- the doughnuts were light and crispy with just enough toppings on it. The place seemed clean except for one fly that was flying around the toppings - not sure how you can avoid having them inside, but overall it was a fun experience!"}
{"text":"Oh, Fractured Prune. What a concept. One I think that's a little better in theory than in application. 

The batter for the donuts is superb. I probably could eat it on its own, no problem, and I'm usually not the biggest fan of cake donuts. I'm partial to the lemon glaze with some sort of crumbly topping, because the tartness balances the sweetness pretty well. But in my experience, most of the other glazes that they have are way too sweet, especially if you're gonna add a super sugary topping too. 

A trip here usually takes quite a while. I get that everything is made fresh and that's all part of the experience, but the wait gets to be pretty long when there are more than a couple people in line, seeing as most people are getting a few. The setup is also slightly awkward, as there's no real place to line up when you're handing over your order form. It can get a little crowded, with people just kind of waiting in clusters throughout the shop. However, the environment is always very clean and organized. 

My biggest issue is probably pricing. Again, I get that it's a novelty thing and so it's obviously gonna cost more than your standard donut. But $1.89 seems a little steep for a single donut. 9 times out of 10, I'm gonna head down to Bosa Donuts instead and get myself an amazing donut for 79 cents."}
{"text":"Delicious old fashioned donuts! I thought it was a fun experience to choose all of your own toppings and watch your donut be made. The donuts are a little on the expensive side but if your just looking to have a single donut treat I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Having been to the original location in Ocean City, I'm happy to saw the doughnuts are just as delicious. Super friendly staff and very clean. If you like doughnuts and have never been to a Fractured Prune, you're missing out.  Warm, delicious, and customizable goodness. Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Cream aren't even in the same category as Fractured Prune. So happy to see this franchise slowly growing it's locations across the US."}
{"text":"This place is so good, we actually first tried a fractured prune doughnut in Maryland a couple years ago. Very good, but oh so lethal lol"}
{"text":"I came in because it was in the area. I wanted to check it out. NOT IMPRESSED. First this was the first time we visited this place. We figured out that we needed to fill out a paper and tell the cashier what we wanted. Not too hard to figure out. We ordered and paid. We then sat there for 15 minutes. We were taking so we did not notice that no one had called us. Which ok llike Starbucks sometimes that happens. Well I got up to look at the counter and the cashier told me bye guys! I told her, we have not gotten our order. She said oops you must not have heard me when I called your order. Sure I get that and my fault for not paying attention. But where is my order. She then went behind the counter and started our order. Hmmmm? My fault? No, but good try. Anyway we got our order and left since it was going to close in 20 minutes anyway. Dh got his with ice cream on top so, he had to eat it before we left. He said the ice cream tasted old and frost bitten. He ate anyway. When we got home I was surprised the donut was still warm. I ordered apple and nuts. There was 3 pieces of apple and 1 nut on it. I ate the apple pieces and the nut and chucked the donut part to my dog. Which he loved! Dh wound up doing the same with his. We won't be going here again."}
{"text":"12.60 for 6 donuts? Really? Maybe back east where wages are much higher. Will not be here a year from now...book it."}
{"text":"Yum! If you love customized fresh cake donuts, then this is definitely the place for you. I've known about this place for a while, and a great deal on Groupon is what made me finally make my way over. I have a huge sweet tooth, and their list of amazing donuts definitely had me excited. I ordered half a dozen donuts, and it took them about 5-10 minutes to prepare. The staff was super friendly, and the wait was well worth it. These are definitely some of the tastiest donuts I've had in a while, but the only down side was that they weren't too soft the next day - but what can you expect from donuts, right? 

These are best to get if you plan to devour them within a few hours from purchasing them."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The donuts are always fresh and made to order! They have the coolest way you order too! Grab a little form and either pick one of their awesome creations or make your own! 

We tried an OC Sand, a Strawberry princess, and a blackberry with nilla wafer toppings! The kids loved watching them make the donuts! They are also really light and have a slight crunch to them, they aren't heavy thick cake donuts like the other donut shops. It's really worth giving them a try!

Also their customer service is awesome. The guys helped me decide and weren't bothered and didn't rush. They only took about a minute to make them fresh! It was a great place!"}
{"text":"Doughnuts were hot, fresh and good. The reasoning behind the 3 stars is due to 1) the manager/ shift supervisor/ the person who rang us up came across as arrogant and unfriendly 2) the seating/eating area was dirty and we were 2 of 3 customers in the place 3) the place where they assemble the doughnuts was dirty as well. It was unappetizing. I will try it again. Hopefully I will go back to a clean & friendly environment."}
{"text":"Mouth watering donuts and toppings! We finished a dozen without blinking. Great customer service and friendly people."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for doughnuts, I went there yesterday. I had a vanilla glazed doughnut with the cookie crumble topping. So many combinations, an completely customisable. They are served fresh and hot right to you. I went there with my two friends. One got a vanilla glazed doughnut with granulated sugar as a topping. The other friend I am not sure about what she got but it was probably delicious. It is really cool that they allow you to see the process of the doughnuts being created. Very nice staff, indeed. Highly organised group. They have ordering cards. The crew shows you exactly how to use the ordering cards. Clean establishment, and they had a wall- mounted flat screen television...WOW!!!
Indoor and also outdoor seating. The bathroom was very clean. The soap smelled, \" just like heaven\" lol
They have a frame on the wall with the fractured prune logo on it. You can also purchase fractured prune paraphernalia. ( e.g. Frisbees, stuffed dogs, coffees mugs, tumblers, and teddy bears) You should definitely visit here if you love doughnuts!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad donut here. They are so good and have the best flavors! This location is really clean and has very friendly staff. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"OMG! These donuts are out of this world! They are the reason I am skinny fat and don't care! Best donut spot EVER!"}
{"text":"It's a really fun concept, and we had a good time choosing donuts. We had hoped that the flavors would be natural instead of artificial but unfortunately they were artificial. So the strawberry shortcake tasted like a pop tart. It's not a gourmet experience as we would have liked, but it was still fun."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I LOVE DONUTS!!! I had heard of this place for awhile but I was finally in the area and got to try it. I loves the whole idea of creating your own donut. These are definitely not your typical donuts and since they make them as you order they are always fresh! 

We created our own donuts; mint glaze with vanilla wafers, strawberry glaze with mini marshmallows, and peach glaze with cinnamon sugar. 

We also bought a dozen of thier features donuts to take home. Definitely try strawberry shortcake & blueberry hill.

A must try spot!!"}
{"text":"I worked at Dunkin Donuts for much of my teen years, and I'm not actually a fan of donuts, after that.  You get burnt out on a thing, you know?  But when I do eat donuts, I prefer them to be above average and better, and these are definitely that.  The only other donuts I'll eat in the break room are Bosa, if somebody brings those in, but they're heavy with oil.  Fractured Prune, on the other hand, are cake donuts that manage to be fluffy.  The various glazes and toppings make for fun combinations, and the staff that I encountered here were very friendly and accomodating.  It appeared that they're family, and they seem to care that you have a good experience.  The only thing that I would have liked was variety with the cake donut, itself.  Like a chocolate cake donut, blueberry cake, etc.  And maybe fritters, and what not.  But that's maybe not the model (I understand that this chain comes from back East), so it's probably not fair for me to fault them for not offering items that none of their stores offer.  They're not inexpensive, if you get a few with coffee, or whatever, but then they're much better than store-bought cheap donuts.  It's a nice treat on a weekend morning - I recommend."}
{"text":"Heard great reviews from friends,  so decided to try. 
Long story short doughnuts were hot and fresh smelled fantastic, now the downside once they dip and  speinkle their magic the doughnuts  become a hot soggy mess...... not good"}
{"text":"Custom donuts.

Let that sink in for a minute - let the possibilities wash over you like a warm, sugary glaze. Let the thought permeate the moist, spongy cake of your being. 

A friend told me about this place, and I was immediately excited about the idea. Don't get me wrong, I still love Krispy Kreme, but after a while the same variations on sugar, chocolate, maple, and fruit-filled wear thin. And Bosa is good, too, but the idea of getting your very own custom-made fresh donut sounded amazing.

I dropped by on a Saturday afternoon after watching \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" (which was terrific, btw). There weren't a lot of customers in the store, which was perfect for me. I looked over the little menu sheet, and since it was my first time I stuck to the popular options on the front. A few minutes later they handed me a box of hot, fresh donuts and I rushed home to devour them.

They were SO good. The Black Forest (cherry glaze with chocolate chips sprinkled on top) was just wonderful - soft, melty, chocolatey goodness. And the others were all terrific, too. I actually missed them a little when I finished off my half-dozen the next day. 

Move over, Krispy Kreme, there's a new top dog in town."}
{"text":"Fresh hot doughnuts, what's not to like. While they were not the best ones I have ever had they were a solid doughnut that is made to your exact specs. I would recommend stopping by if you are a doughnut lover."}
{"text":"Bacon on my donut...yes please....This place is great and donuts are made fresh while you wait."}
{"text":"Was not as impressed as everyone else. Yes you can get the toppings you want but it is the same cake donut for everything. Warm donuts immediately eaten were decent but not worth the price. I will go back to Krispy Kreme or Bosa for unique donuts."}
{"text":"We'll start with the good. The flavor & topping combos are unique and essentially endless with the create your own options. The doughnuts are not produced en masse, but in very small batches, so they're super fresh, and you can watch the entire process from a large window. We tried 3 doughnuts to share: Banana Cream Pie, Key Lime, and a create your own with mocha glaze and bacon topping.

The best thing Fractured Prune has going for it is the novelty factor. The customization/build your own trend in food is huge, and this place caters perfectly to that, especially for kiddos. 

Now, the negative. There's only 1 type of doughnut, vanilla cake style. No chocolate, no nothing else. You have to really be in the mood for THIS doughnut. The toppings and glazes are all pretty intense (even \"Plain Jane\"), so this strikes me as more of a treat than breakfast. 

They are SO fresh that the glaze is really runt and messy initially, and the doughnut doesn't seem dense enough to stand up to its toppings. Interestingly, trying the 2nd halves 2 hours later, they were MUCH better! 

Finally, they're a little over $2 a piece, which is pricey for doughnuts. Granted, still not a lot of $, but double most everywhere else.

Overall, we thought the donuts were just okay. We absolutely love BoSa, and this is just a different type of place. A great alternative to ice cream night or a fun treat for your kids though, for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow.. I was so happy to have found this place. The customized order list is amazing. I suggested Nutella to add because that is just amazing. The only thing I must say is that they are Cake donuts which is fine but if they had the other type of donuts I would be here everyday!! Which is bad but it's that good"}
{"text":"So good they're bad!! I've picked up Fractured Prune donuts the last two weeks for birthday gifts at work. My coworkers loved them. They are a welcomed change from the traditional donuts we typically pick up."}
{"text":"This is the best cake donut I've ever had. Fried fresh for each order, choose your glaze and toppings. Delicious and truly best eaten warm and fresh."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the texture.  The donut was delicious with the soft inside the the crispy outside.  I wasn't as thrilled with the topping choices.  Tried the salted caramel.  Would likely do cherry or strawberry with chocolate sprinkles next time."}
{"text":"Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Hot donuts, wonderful glazes, and outrageous toppings. Basically everything you ever wanted. Definitely the best donuts I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"They look beautiful.... I just didn't care for them. They are very heavy, and if you are not used to it, it will make you ill. They are also a little pricey and the toppings tasted too much like artificial flavoring. A great concept, just a little too much grease for my liking."}
{"text":"The doughnuts rock almost as much as the staff. Check out the pumpkin spice now that it is back in season."}
{"text":"Over priced. Nothing too amazing. I would go back and get one donut as a treat. When they cool they are not very good."}
{"text":"Love that they make the donuts fresh when you order. Lots of yummy toppings. Super great value. Was a little disappointed in the maple-bacon donut; normally I love those but it was meh here. Fortunately there's a ton of other options. The éclair is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Fresh donuts made to order and come out hot, it doesn't get much better! Also offer decent coffee with a variety of creamer choices.

Have a patio in the front and back for seating as well."}
{"text":"4 stars but one complaint. They would not honor the yelp \"check in\" offer for one free donut. I bought a dozen. Not sure why she would just honor the yelp offer and give me 13th donuts for free. Anyways.... the donuts are amazing. They are always made to order so they are hot and fresh. A dozen cost around $15.00. Place is kept clean and has plenty of seating and parking."}
{"text":"These donuts are so delicious you will swear there is crack in them! They are unlike any other donuts you will find in the valley. And the best part is you can make custom donuts too. I usually stick with the OC but they have something for everyone! Definitely a fun place to go."}
{"text":"This place will get my money every time! I swear they're sprinkling crack in the batter before cooking & serving them with sprinkled crack pieces. We couldn't stop eating them. We we're so pissed we ordered such a small box, we thought about robbing the place of all their donuts. Lol. The sea salted caramel with bacon is my heroin. I almost lost two of my own fingers because my mouth was faster than my hands. The next time you go, I'll be on the outside with a sign that reads \"Work for donuts!\" Give me your spare change."}
{"text":"This place is on point. Easily deserving of the five stars. I felt like a child almost burying my face in the delicious creation they had recommended. I've been craving something from here ever since I went."}
{"text":"This is by far the most unique and coolest donut shop I've been to! They make the donuts right in front of you. They have set kinds or you can also customize your own! It doesn't get much better than that! My favorites are the OC sand dollar and cookies and cream."}
{"text":"My daughter dragged me in here one afternoon because is supposedly a life changer.
They had a 3 for $5 special going on.
Fresh made? I don't think so ours were kind of stale and our donuts came out NOTHING looking like the pictures we ordered from.
i don't know if thats just how their made or the teenage boy that made them put ZERO effort into making them. As an adult, I was not impressed by this place."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy!!! I am currently chomping on my doughnuts as we speak. I ordered the blueberry hill, cookies & cream, and OC sand. I'm pretty sure I can eat the donut plain on its own. But all the glazes and toppings are perfection. I was worried coming in at 6pm would mean we get doughnuts that have been sitting out but these are made to order, right in front of you. The employees like to chat with each other while they're making your doughnuts but that didn't bother me. They were warm and friendly. And the price to me was reasonable - under $2 per donut. $15.99 for a dozen. I actually had a bad first impression of these because the first time I had a taste of one was from a client at my work and they were sitting out for awhile. I suggest anyone coming in eat their doughnuts right away. Can't wait for this to open in Cityscape because I'm from the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Why can't I give 10 stars? Deeeelish! It's clean, the staff is very friendly, and most importantly the food is good! I tried a little bit of a few different ones and couldn't pick a favorite. They are cake donuts, tpiping hot, and made right in front of you. What a great concept! My diet definitely wishes I wouldn't have found this place!"}
{"text":"Drove up from Tucson on the way to the Phoenix airport and made sure to stop at Fractured Prune because a friend raved about their donuts. We got a 6-pack of assorted donuts and honestly was not impressed. They were a little small and they all tasted pretty similar. We agreed we would've rather spent our money on Krispy Kreme or even Dunkin'. For the price and supposed locality of Fractured Prune, it should've been way more of an experience."}
{"text":"This is the only place you can find freshly made old fashioned donuts, while you watch and wait! The people working there are really cool and willing to explain all the different flavors and toppings. My personal fav is the Blackberry donuts. 
I recently took the GF there to try it out, and she was overwhelmed to the point of panic, looking over all of the selections! 
An order of 3 different flavors and one bite and now, she's hooked!"}
{"text":"I've heard much about this place and decided to give it a try. I ordered a French toast donut, a Black Forest donut and the breakfast donut with the egg bacon and cheese and a cup of coffee. He said he had to start a fresh pot of coffee. Ok that's fine. Well this person continued to wait the rest of the customers that were in there instead of taking maybe 2 minutes to start the coffee. My donuts were ready way before the coffee     I was missing the breakfast one. I told him and he said it took a little longer. Ok
I said. I waited and waited and did not see an egg being cooked anywhere. I finally got my coffee after I just about finished with my donuts. I finally went up to the counter a 3rd time and asked for my money back. The cashier said no problem.  I never had one I don't think it's very good.  I don't think anyone was bothering to make that breakfast donut.  I don't know if they expected me to just forget about it or what. Why advertise something you can't or don't want to make.  The donuts I had were ok. I was not that impressed. I expected much more after all the rave reviews I heard.  I wouldn't go back again. The service was terrible."}
{"text":"Good warm donuts. Some hits. Some misses. Bacon donut is just ok. Bacon was too soft. The Arizona donut was nasty! The chocolate one was good as well as marshmallow. Staff was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.....bought 6 and did not care for any of them.  Although I like raised doughnuts better, wanted to check this out and was really expecting great things, especially for the price.  I bought 6 for 12 bucks!!   So I thought, ok, this will be good!  The Apple Pie-not enough stuff on it, tasted like cinnammon and sugar.  Cherry/Chocolate-couldn't hardly taste the cherry.  Key Lime-not like the picture.....not enough stuff on it to even flavor it.  Blueberry-again, not enough stuff.  I think because they are HOT, the stuff does not stick, but still, very disappointing.  The Banana cream pie and the key lime tasted the same.....fried doughnut with no stuff on it!  Plus they are smaller than the other donut shops.  Plus, they did not have the chocolate Eclair available.  Won't go again!  Not for that price!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fun novelty donut shop that everyone must experience once but, they don't have any raised donuts or chocolate donut options. I tried the Blueberry Cobbler, chocolate glazed with chocolate chips and honey glazed. My fav was the blueberry. 
Skip the chocolate chips unless your looking for a candy bar experience on a donut. 

Plus, I enjoy looking at a big display of beautiful donuts not pictures of donuts to choose from. 

New cold brew coffee was pretty good!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place I was finally in Arizona. I finally got to try it out so how it works is they have a form which you fill out of what kind of glaze you want on your donut I.e caramel chocolate etc and what toppings you want then give it to them. The donuts where fresh when I was there not sure if this is how they are like that all the time. They also have donuts already named which they have created by themselves. The donuts get messy when you eat them and I recommend milk. Overall a great place highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ate one blueberry flavor and it was pretty good I'd say. Too bad I'm counting calories :) delicious"}
{"text":"The story behind the Fractured Prune is enough for 4 stars alone, but the fact that they make piping hot donuts with seemingly limitless topping selections is pretty amazing too.  Today on our cheat day (it sucks to get old and calorie count, gone are the halcyon days of eating anything and everything and never gaining an ounce) we decided to try this place.  My first bite of the blueberry glaze with crushed vanilla wafers reminded me of eating the deep fried outer layer of a fresh, hot corn dog.  The flavor of the donut was  identical, only with a super sweet glaze.  These donuts are not my favorite, but for people who love super sweet glazes this is the place to go.  The customer service was stellar, the girls behind the counter were extremely knowledgeable.  I'll be taking my friends who love sweet goodness for dessert and breakfast!"}
{"text":"You've never eaten at anything like Fractured Prune unless you've eaten at a Fractured Prune.  The concept is new and fresh. Warm plain cake donuts done many ways. There are many glazes and toppings to choose from.  

We tried three different kinds; the blueberry, OC sand, and the peppermint patty. All were  good and warm. I have a feeling these May be better when warm. I'd like to go back and try a bunch of the others.  There are recommended combinations so if you are unsure what to make, try one of those. I did like the OC Sand best out of the ones we tried. It is also the most popular selection. The staff was helpful and courteous."}
{"text":"Excellent doughnuts! Excellent service! Hot delicious cake doughnuts exactly how you want them. A custom donut for less than $2? YES PLEASE"}
{"text":"Wishing I could give this place 5 stars because I love the concept but it falls just short. Im not a fan of cake doughnuts but they are still good. With toppings and glaze, they are just too sweet. 
Enough about that... Heres the good stuff. Every time I come in, it is always clean and organized. They cook the doughnuts right there to order, you've got to love that. Theres a nice assortment of glaze and topping choices and its also convenient that you can take your list home with you to keep track of what you've got and what you like."}
{"text":"Not too bad for a donut shop. It's like an assembly line of you watching them build your doughnut. I ordered 6 different types to go for myself and friends. Lots of sugar!!! The donut base is similar to a really fluffy cake donut and then they top it with a glaze and other toppings. You can choose from their selection or even make your own. My favorite was the blackberry cobbler donut. You place your order on a paper and they also have photos of what the donuts look like to help you decide. (I liked that). I ordered the \"bacon bomb\" in my half dozen, I love bacon but was not a fan. The bacon had a weird fake smoked flavor. The lemon donut was also a hit! Enjoy!! The staff was friendly and there was a crowd for a Sunday afternoon at Westgate!"}
{"text":"Just left this place this morning to pick up 1 doughnut.   It was an expensive doughnut, but it tasted amazing.   I got the French Toast doughnut.   Every doughnut comes out made to order!   I think the idea is fantastic.  It is basically the only doughnut shop I am going to from now on.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Come in and get your sugar high!  This place is very good for a franchise donut chain.  They were featured on Food Network.  Fractured Prune is a all cake donut shop that customizes every donut.  You can make your own concoctions or they have a menu of amazing creative tasty donuts.  I am going to recommend 3 donuts for you.  My top 3 are the bacon bomb, muddy pig, and the most popular according to Fractured Prune and that is OC Sand.  The OC Sand is honey glaze + cinnamon sugar.  If you are a cake donut person this is the place to go.  I have not had a better cake donut than Fractured Prune.

{"text":"Hot and fresh donuts made to order. They offer total customized donut, glazed with your choice of 19 glazes and 14 toppings. Didn't realize that I was missing this in my life. Fantastic donuts."}
{"text":"So good! Not a cake donut not a regular donut. More like a funnel cake donut if u can imagine it. Custom made a bacon maple donut. Bomb.com son!"}
{"text":"The best fresh donut intown. I don't mind driving 45 mins from my place to have what I want. Love love it"}
{"text":"Wow, I didn't think donuts can be call high end, well this can!  

It was great to be able to create a custom donut of your choice of glaze and toppings, no other donut place can do this, however I am just a simple gal - sugar donut and honey glaze.

For $2.12 for a donuts, it is quiet expensive!!  Consider you can usually get a dozen of donuts for less than $10.

It was a great experience though!"}
{"text":"You have to be a fan of the cake donut to really like this place. Nice clean shop. Greeted promptly. You begin by filling out a menu card of the type of cake donut you want them to create for you. Different icing/glazes and other toppings. Donuts were made correctly and to order. Our group tried 6 different combinations between us. Best was a sweet bbq like glaze with bacon crumbles. But under all the fluff was the same boring cake donut. Do yourself a favor and find a real donut shop/bakery and try your luck with their variety of goods."}
{"text":"It's a great concept: custom-made donuts hot out of the fryer with your choice of a wide variety of glazes like peach, blueberry, chocolate, etc. with a variety of the toppings such as mini marshmallows, mini m&m's, sea salt, and many more. The donuts were tender and the flavors were good, except for the bacon, which was soft and not at all crisp. My major complaint with this place is that they use hydrogenated oil in their donuts (I confirmed with an employee). Come on people, it's 2014 and the FDA has banned hydrogenated oils because they are a huge health concern and a major artery clogger. Surely something else healthier could be used. Just because it's an indulgent dessert food doesn't mean it can't be healthier. This problem will be solved once the ban is in effect and they are forced to find a different oil to use. Until then, I won't be going back. /sadface"}
{"text":"Really really light donuts I did not expect with a cake donut... highly recommend! The mocha and the bacon ones are my fav!"}
{"text":"The donuts are cake donuts, so they're very moist and quite good, I might add.

Only issues is the price, which is what we were expecting, but weren't expecting the donuts to be as small as they were.

If you're in the mood for a couple over-the-top donuts, I would absolutely come here. If you're looking for anything else, go traditional."}
{"text":"Saw this place on the news this morning and I had to come give it a try. Fresh made donuts with custom glazes and toppings. There are so many options to choose from and the choices are endless. If you can't decide on what to get they have a set of 15 custom donuts you can chose from . For a dozen donuts it's $15.99 and single donuts are about $2.00 each. 
I would defiantly come back and create my own custom donut"}
{"text":"My sister bought me a bacon covered donut to cheer me up last week. I'm pretty sure it was the grossest thing I have ever put in my mouth. The bacon was so greasy and overpowered the rest of the donut. Willing to try again soon tho."}
{"text":"This place has a different spin on doughnuts. We went one evening and they weren't busy but it took a good 20 minutes to get a dozen to go. The doughnuts were ok but nothing that I would have to go back for"}
{"text":"I'm have no idea what the hype is here!?! I got a donut it was like eating straight grease!! Won't ever be back."}
{"text":"I'm kind of a donut connoisseur. Having had donuts in every major city I've traveled to across the US I've only tried Bosa's in the Phoenix Metro Area, I needed something a little more gourmet. 

These donuts have an excellent dough cooked pretty fresh so you get them when they're still warm. With a nice crust texture on the outside and moist fluffy interior, these donuts hold their own on my list of great donuts. 

I'll be back..."}
{"text":"The worst chemically tasting donut I've ever had.  I love donuts and the concept of creating your own flavored donut sounds fantastic.  Excited that they made me fresh donuts with all these awesome looking flavors.  They are expensive but I thought for a custom It could be worth the price.  As I shared them with friends.  All of us agreed that they tasted very chemically.  

love the concept, hate the donut."}
{"text":"This is one great place for custom donuts. Don't come expecting regular donuts. They have a number of different toppings and you can also create your own! They have coffee and other drinks as well!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 4-5 stars, but the fact that they don't have nuts as a topping option REALLY is a bummer for a donut place. I've asked the workers about it, and get the line that it's because of allergies. I don't buy that for a minute. It's a cost thing. Just charge a tiny bit more to add nuts per donut. Until that happens, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The two team members are super nice. When we walked in we were greeted immediately and one even walked all the way out beyond the counter to explain how everything worked. We got blueberry hill, strawberry shortcake and banana cream pie. Came out  warm and crispy! My 1 year old approves! Don't forget to check in to get a free donut! No matter how many toppings you get, the price Is the same =D

One thing I did notice is that someone was on their phone with the gloves on =( . I'm a germ freak ."}
{"text":"I was driving by and saw this place, so I thought I would stop in, and I'm glad I did.  I don't think I'll ever go back to the \"standard\" doughnuts that you find all over town which are nothing but sugar.  These doughnuts had amazing flavor and texture.  It only took about 5 minutes for them to make a dozen.  Reading these other reviews makes me sad --- people, these are made from scratch in front of you.  If you want the \"norm\", go back to dunkin!  I'm talking to you \"Draconia C\" -- stay home and play with your cats!"}
{"text":"Let me start with saying....The night staff on 1-8 was bomb.com. They were so nice and patient when we walked in at literally 5 mins to close. I could not appreciate that more. They accommodated our group of savage men who were out busting criminals all night....they helped save the city that night...

These donuts are fancy...and delicious. Salted carmel was so good. Again, these are fancy donuts, so you will pay $5 for 2 donuts, and upwards of $15 for a dozen. This is more of a specialty doughnut shop."}
{"text":"Pretty good donut place. I am personally a Bosa guy, but these were pretty good. It is a designer donut with many flavor options to choose from. The donut itself has a very fried taste. The toppings were good. It's not an everyday donut, but it's not bad. Give it a try. Fun date idea for those on a budget."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth cake doughnuts is all you need to know! Just go try it, the price for one donut is $1.89 which I don't mind paying if I'm getting a fabulous, flavorful, delicious donut like these! I wish they had another location out by queen creek because I'm never out in the chandler area but I will always remember these little gems."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is- but going there today seemed as if the employees working there were bothered by the customers who walked in. The young Tweens just didn't seem to care (doesn't surprise in the least)  and would take forever to make.   \"80 min wait!!! What?!?  Seriously ??   No thanks .  Me & like 6 other people walked out!!! Besides, not worth the price!"}
{"text":"Donuts here are great. I like how they make it fresh and right there when you order it. My bf and I ordered the Maple Bacon and the Mocha glaze.  I wish the donuts were slightly bigger for its price, but the taste of it was almost on point.  I would recommend coming here again."}
{"text":"I am a true fatty. Got 6 donuts and ate 4 on the spot..although I now regret this gluttony, I didn't while devouring it. I would do it again if I had the chance, which I will. 
The donuts are like cake not chewy. Which is awesome actually cause you can share the flavors with your date or whoever you want to share it with. Or you can just eat it all by yourself. ;)
You can't go wrong with any flavors. It's all really good. I don't know what else to say, I'm just speechless by this  place. Mind=blown"}
{"text":"I thought Bosa doughnuts were the best but oh how wrong was I!!!!! These are the best doughnuts ever!!! So many glazings and toppings to choose from, so many combinations to create... Made from scratch  oh this is doughnut heaven!!!!"}
{"text":"While in AZ We were desperate for donuts and Fractured Prune was the only place open at 8:45pm.  We Ordered:
Death by chocolate, Cookies n Cream, Coffee cake, French Toast, classic Chocolate, Rainbow Sprinkles.
Oh My... U have to eat them while they're warm, the toppings are amazing and the donut cake is so awesome!  It's a good thing they're $2 each, otherwise I would've eaten a dozen ."}
{"text":"I love doughnuts. Let me get that out there first. So here is my review. It's a cake doughnut. It is not the fluffy buttery crispy cream type.There is only plain old small cake doughnuts with different toppings. No fillings, no long johns, no squares.  Costs double. A decent doughnut if you like cake. I do not prefer them to Basha's, Albertsons, Bosa etc. My kids loved them. I will not go again."}
{"text":"First time going there this last Friday because of another friend that mentioned it on instagram. Been open for a few weeks now. Good and you got to love it when you have options on what to put on your own doughnut. I went basic with a maple glazed doughnut with some bacon crumbles."}
{"text":"Interesting concept.  It seems like everyone is following the Subway model of ordering.  I have been here a few time, and know they have a solid product.   You write your selection on a pre printed paper, hand it to the counter person, and two minutes later you receive your toppings on a donut no more than 10 minutes old.  The donuts are too fresh to eat by hand.  Gooey, sloppy, soft, full of topping in the most decadent way, a fork and knife are needed. 

Four donuts and a cup of coffee cost $12 dollars. 

On a final note, upon entering the store, you are immediately met with a sewer order.  This is likely a city issue but still very off putting.  I have been here numerous times and never had this issue before, hence no deduction in yelp stars."}
{"text":"All the doughnuts have the same base but you get to pick your own glaze and toppings which make each doughnut unique. Was not disappointed with my mocha glaze doughnut with Oreo topping :)"}
{"text":"Ever since I saw a place in California that does fancy donuts, I've been craving for one. I didn't want to wait until a cali trip to go get one either, so I yelped donuts just to see what was around. 
Last week is when I came across this place and have been wanting to go ever since.  Well today was the day thanks to national coffee day. I went to dutch Bros and got me a coffee and then headed with some friends to go try out this place. It was amazing! Staff is cheerful and helpful.. Customers ask each other what they're getting and, like us newbies, they help you out.. One lady named several that she gets for a group of people and shes like \"you can't go wrong.  They're all good!\". And boy was she right... I have donuts every once in a while. Maybe 2 times a year or 3. I love the fact that they are cake donuts and that I can put whatever I want on it vs just sprinkles at a local donut shop.  
Honestly because of the fact that you can put whatever you want on them, the price is not bad. I will definitely be returning when I have a donut craving."}
{"text":"Being a donut fiend, I had to try this place out and had it bookmarked. If you do not know what to expect, you may not have an enjoyable experience.

This is more of a dessert than a have-for-breakfast type of donut. The donuts are all cake donuts, no raised glazed. They offer several glazes and several toppings. Just go to their website and look at them all. They also have popular or pre-fab combinations. Of course, you can just make up your own combinations. You go in, take an order form, fill out what you want and how many of each you want, then give it to the cashier.

You donuts, or in this case as they spell it--doughnuts--are then made fresh. There is a slick machine that a person cranks and it bloops out the exact amount of doughnut dough in a perfect circle into the shortning. A conveyor then properly cooks it and turns it. Then another person takes the doughnut, reads your order, and plops it into the various glazes and puts on the toppings.

We ordered a dozen in a dozen of their flavor combinations to test out. Since we just finished eating supper, I was the only one that had one fresh. And it was really pretty tasty Very tasty It was the Key Lime doughnut. The doughnut itself was nice and crispy on the outside and cake-y fluffy on the inside. Yummy.

We then went home to Tucson. Later that evening, we all tried several. In the few hours where they cooled down, they didn't taste as good to me as when it was hot and fresh. Keep in mind that all the flavors are artificial. The colors are bright as a result of heavily artificial flavors and coloring. We were not too impressed. As a matter of fact, as much as our family LOVES doughnuts, these sat around our house for three days without being eaten and were eventually thrown away.

So here's my tip: treat this as a dessert and just order one or maybe two for you. They are always made fresh to order, so you will have a hot doughnut that will be crispy on the outside and fluffy on the outside. Then you will enjoy thiis doughnut more. Don't buy a dozen unless your party is large enough to eat them right away."}
{"text":"Maple and bacon donut was delicious considering I got it for free via YELP :)"}
{"text":"These donuts are ridiculously good.  Bacon doughnuts.  Holy God please forgive me for how many of these I'm going to eat!!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. We got one Gorilla and one Salted Caramel. They were both good. They didn't stand out to me as worth going out my way to get a doughnut, but I live close, and will probably be back."}
{"text":"I have their doughnuts when I go to Suns games and they're the best doughnuts I've ever had. Damn near best thing I've ever had. At least in the running. My favorite is the blueberry but they're all great."}
{"text":"One day someone woke up and said:  I'm going to cut a fresh fried doughnut in half, add an egg, bacon and cheese to it and then call it the eggnut. That person holds the key to every fat persons skinny jeans closet. Yum yum yum! I thought I would never publicly admit to eating this treat, but I guess I just did. I also took a few doughnuts to go: banana cream pie, french toast, and rocky shores. Here is my one complaint: the dough for all the doughnuts is the same. I wish there was a way to flavor the doughnut instead of rely on the toppings to carry the flavor. The iced coffee wasn't all that special either. I love the idea of this place. I'll give it another go around. The eggnut made this a 4 star review, just sayin'!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The lads here helped me with custom donuts to use in an upcoming photo shoot and we're kind and took their time explaining how everything works. Not to mention, their donuts are absolutely delicious. I definitely suggest them."}
{"text":"While they have great donuts they have horrible customer service. I walked in at 2 pm and they were currently making donuts for a family if 7 that was paying and they told my family of 4 that they were out of dough and couldn't help us. I could drive to Gilbert if I wanted to though because they were open. I have two groupons to use and then I won't be back. And I will go to Gilbert to use those."}
{"text":"I love donuts. I make it a point to find good donut shops when I travel, that's how much I love donuts. So when I heard Fractured Prune had opened up of course I had to go check it out. I loved the concept of customized donuts. Even more I loved the fact that they serve their donuts hot. But that's where my love for Fracture Prune ended. 

My boyfriend and I got a few different flavors to try out. All of them were way too sugary sweet. I ate one and felt like I was sinking into a sugar coma. And it left kind of a bad aftertaste. But the worst part was how I felt later. I reacted to these donuts as if I ate MSG. When I eat MSG I get super crabby and that's exactly what happened after I ate these donuts. No thanks!

And they were expensive - $2.00 a donut. I'll stick with the cheaper and better tasting donuts from Bosa."}
{"text":"The doughnuts we're good. Smaller than expected. First time here and the cashier gave us a \"warm\" welcome. Relax girl.... No I don't know what I want. Stop looking at me that way for only buying 6 doughnuts.

I'll come back again and try something new."}
{"text":"Willy wonka would stop by this donut shop. Maybe not the one played by Johnny Depp but the older one played by Gene Wilder. The only thing that could make this place a ten star place is if they had umpa lumpas work the donut shop.
The place has so many different glazes and a plethora of toppings, which makes the combinations of donuts endless. They have cherry, mint, chocolate, salted caramel, blueberry, chocolate chips, maple, even bacon!!!!! So once you figure out the type of donuts you want, you can watch the freshly made donuts make their way on the conveyor belt. The donuts are picked up and placed in the glazes of your choose and then the toppings are put on all right in front of your eyes. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Fractured Prune is not the place you run to at 11pm to grab a dozen cheap donuts to fill your late night cravings. They cook to order, use better ingredients, and cost more. Makes sense right? I am positive I will be back many times in the future, and if a location opens up in Downtown Tempe I'm in trouble. They don't have the quirk that VooDoo Donuts has, but they are sure fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"It's like cinabon meets donut.  Really super amazingly yummy.  They come out hot, glazed, customized however you want.  It's about $1.89 a donut, but you only want to order maybe 1 or 2 per person, they fill you up.  It's a cute place to possibly take a date."}
{"text":"Love this donut shop! they always have unique and yummy doughnuts as well as a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Hot buttered heaven baby!!! I have to say I'm so impressed by the whole concept . The different combinations for toppings and glazes is so cool!! You could seriously spend all day creating all kinds of sinful treats . We enjoyed the bacon bomb and the smores doughnut . Both doughnuts we hot , fresh and tasted like a hybrid yeast and cake doughnut .  I can't wait to come back and try a couple more combinations"}
{"text":"The Fractured Prune is a fun and different doughnut concept and I am a big fan! I love being able to customize flavors and mix and match so this is really the type of place for me. The doughnuts are more of a cake style with different glazes and powder/sprinkle toppings. They have multiple pre-fix options, as well as an option to create your own flavor combinations on the order sheet.

Some of the favorites from our group meeting were, chocolate covered cherry, morning buzz (mocha flavored with chocolate topping) and french toast. The customer service was also great and the gentleman on the phone helped me place a phone order after looking over the menu online. I liked the experience so much I went back for another dozen for my fiance's work meeting that same day. They also have a frequent buyer program, when you buy (I think 8 dozen) you get a dozen for free.

Overall great experience. I would highly reccommend trying it out if you have a sweet craving anytime soon!"}
{"text":"You must come here!! 
Super clean store with delish donuts. We came here on a whim today after hearing so many rave reviews.
The staff was very nice and greeted us right away.  They explained the process and gave us time to choose.  We happened to be there during happy hour 11-3 and we got 3 donuts for $5.
Our choices were chocolate covered cherry, dulce de Leche and French toast.  It is hard to choose a favorite, but I think dulce was the winner.
What a find.   Can't wait to come back and try again.  Next time we will come with a crowd so we can try more."}
{"text":"I just walked past this place in my way to AMC and seen a line out the door... After the wack ass movie I went inside and was blown away! When you place your order is when your donut is placed in the hot oil... You watch as they make your craving come to life!! EXCELLENT... Just plain excellent!!"}
{"text":"Bought a dozen to go. I like the concept but the donuts just weren't that great to me. They only had cake donuts, no raised which I am partial to. The pick your own toppings were really nothing special, a bit on the artificial side. And prices were a bit higher than most donut shops also. None of my 4 kids really enjoyed the donuts. They weren't bad, just not that special."}
{"text":"First visit and had an awesome fresh warm salted caramel doughnut! Only concern is it looks like there are way to many varieties to try..."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I really enjoyed the donuts at this restaurant. We visited the Westgate district location. I was very impressed by the menu. I really appreciate the quality customer service. I lost my wallet and they had it waiting for me she. I finally arrived."}
{"text":"Ermagerd. How could you give anything but 5 stars to warm, made-to-order donuts that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside (that's what she said)? I had the Key Lime, my husband had the Salted Caramel and all was right with the world that morning."}
{"text":"Warm blueberry is my absolute favorite. This place is a must try. FP is also reasonably priced. Anddddd the donuts are made to order!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast bite and WAS NOT disappointed. First time at this place, and the guys behind the counter patiently explained how the donuts are 'cook to order' and how to choose your toppings. Ordered two donuts and a cup of coffee, and am already factoring how many miles I need to run this week so I can go back next Saturday..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never heard of this place. They make the donuts right there fresh in front of your eyes and dip them in all sorts of ooey gooey toppings. I got a half dozen ranging from caramel glaze w/ chocolate chips to vanilla glaze with Oreo crumbs to orange glaze to cherry glaze w/ choco chips. This will be my donut spot from now on, honestly Dunkin Krispy Kreme have nothing on this place. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Been here before and they do have good donuts which is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. Reason for the low rating is the fact that they are now forcing people to buy at least 2 donuts. Just went in wanting to enjoy 1 donut and was being told I needed to buy 2 due to a policy change. They said the reason for it was because of the boxes they use and how the smallest box holds 2.  Last time I came here you could get 1 donut on a plate and sit down to enjoy it. I don't think it's right to make people buy 2 especially if they don't have the appetite for it or are trying to make better decisions and wanting to split one with another person."}
{"text":"Donuts are amazing. They are made fresh and you can taste the difference. The donuts have a slightly crisp texture from being fried and the topping selection is phenomenal. I  the Black Forest donut."}
{"text":"I've been in love with this place ever since it opened although I have realized how unhealthy it is. But it's never wrong to treat yourself once in a while. :) they are heaven when they come warm out of the fryer. I love their French Toast and Apple Pie donut as well as experimenting and making my own creations! I do wish they had different flavors of the actual donut tho. That would've been fun!"}
{"text":"Found out through Shannon E. The Fractured Prune's Grand Opening was today, and wasted no time hustling over on my break! 

Apparently, some other guy didn't either: \"I drove all the way out here from Apache Junction for a dozen!\" 

When I walked in I was immediately greeted by Marilyn. She talked me through their custom donut process: Selecting a custom glaze and toppings before handing off your card to a doughnut designer.

Think combinations like Dreamsicle, Chocolate Covered Cherry, Maple Bacon. 

Decided on two Mint Chocolate Chip doughnuts: One for me to scarf down at work, one for Andrew C for later. 

Because he might murder me later for going alone. 

And I'm not a self-centered, lameface lady friend. Doing \"Nice things\" goes both ways, ladies. 

These donuts aren't sitting around in a case, either. Custom means made when you order. 

Got back to work and took a bite. Still piping hot, minty, chocolatey, practically melting in my mouth as I ate it. 

This is really a four star review masquerading as a five star: I love the custom concept; however, I'm more of a \"classic doughnut\" gal: Think Old Fashioned Kruller with some chocolate on it. 

The customer service is what bumped the rating up to five stars! 

Now go, take a doughnut break. Meanwhile, I'll resist inhaling Dude's while waiting for him to pick it up!"}
{"text":"These are definitely more of a cake like donut than the light and fluffy ones. I've read in a previous review that they use hydrogenated oils which is concerning. 

But, the glazes are super tasty! I had a maple bacon and a chocolate covered cherry. They were awesome. The donuts are a bit heavy-it's not like BoSa where you can down 3 of them and be content. I had two and was super full.

The staff is really friendly and kind. I'll be back, but I really really hope they change their oil. It has a funny after taste."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this new concept and actually the donuts are very good.. So many flavor combinations.  My disappointment came as I was leaving.  I stopped to order some to take home.  I ordered a half dozen.  After I paid and was waiting I see that for only $3 more I could have bought a dozen.  When I asked about it she said if I wanted 6 more after paying I would have to pay the per donut price which is $12+ for another 6.  I was very disappointed in the lack of a solution like possibly refunding the first order and maybe recharging me for a dozen.  There was just absolutely no way to do it I guess  ???  Also no coffee refills even for a fee.  Donuts great.. Some work to do in the customer service area..  May be a while before I return.. Lots of choices in this big valley."}
{"text":"Ah the FP! Ever wanted a custom made cake donut? Well now you can! There are a plethora of glazes and toppings to choose from, and you can make your own or go with some of the suggested flavor combinations on the menu.

Each donut is $1.89 with discounts for a dozen. You can also get a plain cake donut but it will also be $1.89. The donuts are fried on the spot so you are getting quality freshness.

I decided on a coffee cake, lemonade, key lime pie, and banana cream pie. I also got 2 plain cake. The donuts had a lovely light crispness around the edges to contrast with the soft moist cake inside. Overall I enjoyed them but they did taste a little more oily than donuts I've had at other donut shops.

Service was excellent.

I love the concept and while it's a little pricey (About the same price as a croissant donut) if you want a custom created donut this is the place to be."}
{"text":"The donuts are great! We wish they had a better coffee selection. As well as some sort of frappe. Bc we were hoping to sit and enjoy donuts and coffee--now we are headed across the street to Starbucks!"}
{"text":"I never knew a donut could try too hard until I tried these. Too many things going on in a single donut, and they were overly syrupy sweet and sticky. I think maybe they were going for artisanal or quirky--trying to tap into the designer cupcake fad? Whatever they're doing though, it just doesn't work. I'll not be returning."}
{"text":"Opening day!  Stopped by to get some fancy pastries for my staff.  From the second I hit the door, the staff were all attentive and helpful.  
  
The options are unreal!  There was so much to choose from that I finally decided to let the pros pick for me.  I picked up 3 dozen dealer's choice doughnuts and they barely hit the break-room before they were gone.
  
The rest of the day I fielded questions on where I picked them up, and when I was bringing in more!!

I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I like fractured prune donuts. I really like fractured prune donuts. I just don't LOVE LOVE LOVE them as if they are the best donut I've ever had. The service is always slow since the donuts are made at the time you order them so it's hard for me to swing by and grab them for the office. I did recently find out they do $12 dozens on Wednesday though so that's prettttty cool. 

Favorite donut ever was from Blackbird in Boston."}
{"text":"Love the variety! You choose your own glazes and toppings, but they also have a menu of suggested combinations, like S'more and Cookies and Cream. We got them both, along with a Lemon and Carnival donut. The Lemon was my favorite! Fractured Prune is like the Cold Stone of donuts. Super fun! 

The staff is so friendly! The manager greeted us at the door, and asked if we'd been there before. This was our first time, and he was happy to explain the menu to us. 

They're open 6 am - 10 pm and offer free Wi-Fi. My husband was in his Army uniform, and they gave us a 25% discount. Great place!"}
{"text":"Just opened. Custom glazes and toppings with fresh made donuts. Tried the Carmel with Bacon topping. Tasty!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love donuts. And it doesn't get any fresher than here. Krispykreme and bosa you gotta get there when they make it, but fractured prune the make it on the spot. And you get to custom it the way you want. I don't know how they messed up on my order since its right in front of them on a piece of paper but it still turned out good. Chocolate donut with bacon. Smores. Marshmallow with cookie crumbs."}
{"text":"I would give them a 5 star if the prices were a little lower. Great friendly service, quick to help make the \"experience\" fun. They have a ton of choices and everyone I tasted rocked. If you are a donut person this is defiantly not a place to pass up. Try at least 3 of their made up flavors and try a few of your own."}
{"text":"Fancy, freshly-made cake donuts, made only when you order. At $1.89 a piece or $15.99 for a dozen, it's definitely worth a shot. Especially since there's a $6 Groupon out there for $10 worth of whatever your heart desires from this donut equivalent of a candy shop.

Ordering might seem a little overwhelming since you get to choose any and every topping on your donut but to help you out, there a number of combinations on their menu which you can customize to your liking. They have lots of interesting ones like Death by Chocolate (chocolate sprinkes, chocolate glaze, and I believe mini chocolate chips), Black Forest (raspberry glaze and mini chocolate chips), and Bacon bomb (I don't know, it had bacon, I'm sold) for starters. I'm sure you'll find something to satisfy that sweet tooth.

Shout out to the guy who did an amazing job making our donuts. Extremely efficient and done with such care, I mean look at those gorgeous donuts!"}
{"text":"After hearing about the Glendale location from a friend, I checked and there was a Chandler location. Yay! My boyfriend and I are always looking for neat places to check out so we came here on a Monday morning. We were promptly greeted by a nice gentleman who helped us with our order. He showed us how to order on the order forms, and gave us some popular suggestions. We both ordered two doughnuts and coffee. The coffee was fresh and really tasty and they had 4 options for creamer! The doughnuts were brought to the table and they were warm and really delicious. We ordered a Key Lime, Cookies n Cream, Maple Bacon and Apple Pie (I think). 

The only things I noticed that weren't perfect were that the gentleman that assisted us wasn't wearing a beard net of any kind and his beard was pretty long (probably 5\" or so). If he had just been working the register it would have been okay with me, but he was handling food and was leaning over the toppings bar as he worked. Also, we may have come in after a rush but there were 4 employees working and the front sales area wasn't the cleanest. None of the tables had been wiped down."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Honestly I expected to be let down after hearing all the hype when they opened 6 months ago but that definitely wasn't the case when my hubby and I stopped in the day after Christmas. The novelty is that you get to make your own donut combinations. You start with the same plain cake doughnut base. Then you choose a glaze (19 choices) and toppings (13 choices). They also have \"specialty\" pre-designed combos to choose from. We tried two speciality recipes and one \"adventurous\" self-made doughnut. The pre-made ones were lemonade and chocolate covered cherry. Delicious! They tasted exactly like what they say. And the doughnuts are cooked fresh in front of you so they were warm. The one we made ourselves, I call it the funky monkey, was banana glaze with coconut. Also very tasty.

Another mentionable  feature was the coffee bar. I appreciate that they had all different types of creamer and milk, including soy. It was a thoughtful touch. 

Overall this was a fun experience, the customer service was great, and the taste was incredible. A word of caution! These doughnut are definitely sweet! Next time I think we will be stopping in for dessert, not breakfast."}
{"text":"Okay I'll start with ,cake style donuts are what normally go for.  So when I walk in the front door and see fresh cake donuts rolling off the \"assembly line\" oh yeah going to be good!  Came in with a crew of 11 year olds post soccer game (they all loved the place).  Funny watching the mind of an 11 year old working with 10 thousand options.  Anyway I had Maple Bacon - mmm donut with bacon and sea salt carmel.  Both were awesome.  Coffee was also top shelf - Bold Roast.  They have carafes of 2%,skim, or 1/2 &1/2 that the friendly staff will fetch from the refrig which is an appreciated touch for me.  Excellent experience!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I like this concept for a donut shop I only wish they had some type of variety in the donut batter instead of all just being the plain cake flavor. I like the fact that you can create your own toppings and the type of glaze you want which is fun. However this is probably a place I would not visit too often. It may also take a while to get your donuts since they are fresh (which is great!) but be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The doughnuts are made fresh and you pick your glaze and toppings. They are cake doughnuts but sooo light! Delicious!! 
The guys working were so nice and even had a doggie treat for my puppy!"}
{"text":"Can only buy donuts in increments of 2, 4, 6, 12. Yelp has a special for a free donut with checkin. I checked in and was told they weren't doing that anymore but she would honor it anyway. Only one girl working. So she had to take all the orders before making any donuts that had been ordered. Donuts are fresh and made to order. Tasted great."}
{"text":"I wanted to find an upscale donut shop in the Phoenix metro area with unique flavors but Fractured Prune fell short of my expectations. I like cake donuts just fine, but since these are fried to order, the frosting melted into the hot donut instead of sitting on top and the remainder of the toppings fell off. Basically, I was left with soggy donuts."}
{"text":"As avid donut lovers, this place is right up our alley. Creative and delicious, it's one of the best!!"}
{"text":"I woke up and I thought to myself \"I need some doughnuts today\". I haven't been to fractured prune for 3 years because personally it's too fried and sweet for me. I wanted to give it another shot, but unfortunately I'm still not that impressed. If you guys ever had VooDoo doughnuts from Oregon then you know what I'm talking about. 

I got:

1. coffee cake (mocha glaze, graham crackers, and powdered sugar)

2. Marshmallow madness (marsh mellows glaze and mini marshmellows)

3. S'more (marshmallow glaze, graham crackers, mini chocolate chips)

4. Rice krispy treat (marsh mellow glaze, cinnamon sugar, rice cereal puffs, marshmallow bits)

If you check in, you get a free doughnut. My favorite was the rice krispy treat. All 4 donuts were $6.33 including the check in."}
{"text":"Best donuts I have ever had! I think what makes them so tasty is that they serve them hot. You can add any topping you want. I had the salted carmel & the French toast. Two was enough but I maybe could have had three. The coffee was good too. I wish they would open more locations. Please open one near Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Read about this place and decided to check it out.  It lives up to the hype, doughnuts come out fresh with the toppings you want. The owner is very nice and tries to greet everyone.  My only complaint is just the lack of the doughnut itself in variety as only one kind is made. I would have loved to have had a devils food doughnut. The place is kept spotless."}
{"text":"Fresh doughnuts! Perfectly warm in the inside, perfect crisp on the outside! 

I walked in there for the first time. I was welcomed and was told about how fractured prune works. The lady dropped the doughnuts and you can watch them being cooked. I ordered a dozen for my team at work. They LOVED it. Looking to make an impression? I'd recommend picking up a dozen of these! 

I selected random flavors. I personally had the blueberry glazed. It was very good and I will definitely come back to try other flavors!"}
{"text":"I love this donut shop! There's a reason they have been expanding like crazy... their donuts are crazy-good. The process is fascinating to watch: the donuts drop into hot oil and cook right in front of you. Then they are dipped in glazes and topping that you customized. It doesn't get any fresher than this. Their \"cake\" donut is really unlike any other you've ever had... a lighter, fluffier, moister version that strikes me what a donut would be like, texturewise, if a cake donut and a raised donut had a baby.

Of the bajillion flavor combinations that you can create, I have settled on some of my favorites. Cookies 'n cream, fer shure. The S'mores donut with graham cracker crumbs, mini chocolate chips and marshmellow glaze is pretty amazing. But I was taken aback by how much I dug the Ms. Prunella donut - berry glaze and cinnamon sugar. Astonishingly good! I made a special trip to stop by here before work on my birthday, so that I could share my love of Fractured Prune with my co-workers. They were hooked as soon as they dug into them! I had tempted them earlier in the week by showing them the website and describing the hot-dipped process that is the unique signature of Fractured Prune. When I mentioned it was my birthday, my donut preparers were awesome... they asked me what I wanted on my (extra) birthday donut. At their suggestion, I tried the Apple Pie donut... delicious!

I tried to get a good variety of donuts in my dozen, which included a maple and bacon-topped donut. I was told that the maple + cinnamon sugar with added bacon was the way to go... they call it their 'bacon bomb\". But alas, when I drove my dozen to work and did the big reveal... they had neglected to \"add bacon\" to the maple donuts. This was almost enough to ding them a star, but I couldn't do it. They're that good..."}
{"text":"I see that Fractured Prune has two Yelp listings, so I'll review them both.  

I went again this morning and got a donut with blackberry glaze and bacon crumbles and it was a thing of beauty.

Also, their bold coffee is like a delicious shot of caffeine right to the jugular vein.  YES!!

I haven't been this excited about a new business before, but once you try their donuts you'll understand why I am..."}
{"text":"W.O.W.! I'm super impressed! Delicious flavor combinations to please any mood and age. Please come to Colorado!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING.  Such a fresh and custom donut.  A bargain for $2.  

They make them right in front of you with numerous toppings.  Wicked good."}
{"text":"I keep coming back for the Rocky Shores donuts (gotta do at least 4) and then I just fill up dozen by adding whatever my mood is. 

Would recommend to get a variety as it's not like a box of chocolate and everything is a surprise, with these donuts you know what you are getting."}
{"text":"Tried a couple of different varieties including the French Toast and Salted Caramel and both donuts left a very undesirable aftertaste. Not even milk helped :(

There's nothing special about the donuts themselves which is unfortunate. The specialty is the ability to custom coat your donut with different toppings. 

Not worth another visit even though the concept is great.... Just need a better tasting donut."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars based on the great service that Mary and her coworker provided, as well as the freshness of the donuts... They make them to order while you wait. I've never been to a donut shop where you are able to create your own donuts like this... What's not to like? I took my menu to the car and the wife and I created our list. We went with key lime/graham cracker, blue berry/vanilla wafer, and vanilla/coconut. Then Mary bright brought to my attention that if I ordered a dozen it would only be $17 as we already had eight all day. So we're added salted caramel, strawberry shortcake, and pina colada. Whew thank God that was over. Unlike at Bosa where you just point here you have to be on your game. Now since we can't count I had to order one more to make that dozen goddamnit we went with her choice lol mystery surprise. The donuts were hot and fresh and very sweet. They were not Bosa or Voodoo and that's OK. Overall they are not my thing and I prefer the above mentioned. This is no reason to knock Fractured Prune. The service was awesome, facility clean, and my donuts were made to order and tasty that equals 5 star."}
{"text":"Be ready for a sugar high, but this place is great! Loved taking my sister's here and we got to watch the donuts made fresh. Also coffee was reasonably priced and a fridge to add the amount of creamer you want! Look for deals on local flavors!"}
{"text":"My wife and I saw the name of this place and just had to check it out. Once I was inside I felt like a kid in a candy store. The options are practically limitless, and all of their fruit glazes are made with real fruit!

We only got two doughnuts: maple glaze with bacon and cinnamon sugar and peach glaze with cinnamon sugar and graham crackers. Both were incredible! The texture was heavenly--fluffy cake doughnut with a moist glaze soaked into it. The flavor was likewise delicious. The glazes were wonderfully sweet without taking over the experience. My only complaint is that the bacon was too soft and lacked flavor, but that didn't ruin the doughnut at all.

I imagine the doughnuts are not quite as good when they are cool, but it seems like they would still be very tasty. All in all, those two doughnuts were two of the best I've ever eaten. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts!!!!!! When you're craving something deliciously sweet - GO HERE! It's super clean, the staff is always really friendly and the donuts come out warm and delicious. They melt in your mouth! I'm craving some now. You guys are the best."}
{"text":"This place is a super special treat. Not a place you'd want to go every day or every week for that matter because it's just so bad for you but it's amazing.

Nothing like a hot donut that has that slightly crisp outside and a nice topping. So delicious.


Less is more as far as flavoring a go. You can go overboard here."}
{"text":"Ive been hearing about this place forever and finally decided to come here with my SO, was not disappointed!! The staff was extremely friendly and engaging, they even have my boyfriend a free donut for his birthday!! The donuts were fresh and warm and the flavors were cool too! My only complaint is the glaze...if you have a cavity or sensitive teeth, you might want to pass. The sugar overload is real..."}
{"text":"First time at the Fractured Prune doughnuts, too many choices they all look so good. I got the French toast and it was most excellent. Nothing better than a warm doughnut and a iced coffee. Oh yeah my doughnut was free because it was my first time here and I checked in on Yelp."}
{"text":"I don't get it. It sounds like it would be a great place with custom donuts, but I thought they tasted terrible. My mom and I tried four different donuts. The blueberry, the salted caramel, the cherry with chocolate chips, and maple. 

I liked that they were warm, but they were so greasy and they left a weird burnt taste in your mouth. I didn't like them at all and neither did my mom.  The blueberry tasted so artificial.  We ate a little of each doughnut and ended up throwing the rest away.

We ordered the donuts to go. The staff seemed friendly. I didn't like the vibe of the place. It seemed a little dirty, and felt kind of depressing.   I appreciate what they're trying to do, but like I said I just don't get it.  I don't know why this place is so highly rated. I prefer the type of donuts you get at Bosa.   These donuts are just over-the-top too much in my opinion.  Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you can smell the warming aroma of freshly baked donuts. Because, yes, they don't fry them up into you order them! Then you can either choose from their menu of creations or create your own from a list of glazes and toppings. I have had the oc sand and blueberry hill twice and they are awesome! They come out warm, cakes, gooey and sugary. What more could you want? I purposely make the trip from gilbert for these decadent,  delicious creations."}
{"text":"Have been here twice. If you want a custom hot donut, this is THE spot. Many flavored of icing, tons of toppings, and the combinations are endless. Just be prepared to spend about $2 per donut. The price is a bit high, but worth it as an occasional treat."}
{"text":"Fractured Prune offered me a fabulous donut experience! The donut was warm, and the flavor I picked rented space on my tongue in such a marvelous way. Go here! Have a donut and grab one for a friend!"}
{"text":"Great doughnuts. My wife and enjoyed our visit. It seems that there is only one type doughnut with different variety of toppings to choose from. But it's Good!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try The Prune as my friends had raved about it and I left, 25 min later with 2 donuts and the urge to never go back.  I was intrigued by the made to order donut concept especially the hot out of fryer part.

Part of the 25 min was our fault, we decided to go on National Donut day which they had a special, buy a drink and get a free donut.  The place was packed, close to 30-40 people in the tiny space, most of which were standing in a line that never moved.  We somehow got to the front of the line, ordered our donuts and moved to the back of the store to wait on our 2, made to order donuts.  Even though the place was packed, the staff there seemed to have no sense of urgency to complete orders.  Since the line wasn't moving, they weren't overwhelmed with orders but no one really seemed to be making donuts.  There were 5 people working and 2 donut making stations set up but only one person at a time actually made the donuts and that was after they stared at the order form for a minute.  

After the long wait, we finally got our donuts and left.  The donuts themselves were just ok, I've had better from a gas station (Casey's Donuts, if you are from the Midwest you know what I am talking about) and the whole experience was just not that great.  I'll stick to my local Bosa"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My girlfriend won a girt card for here and we drove about 45 minutes and it was worth it. Staff was very friendly, clean place, tons of combos to choose from and the prices are incredible!!!!! You can't beat this shop, even though it is out of my way, we will be returning!!! Way to go guys!!!"}
{"text":"A life changing doughnut experience! Seriously, you have to make the time for a visit at least once even if you don't live in the area. If you do live in the area? I hope you have some self control cause this place is where your cheat day goes off the deep end. I tried the strawberry shortcake and my boyfriend created his own. Both were so delicious!! We will definitely be visiting again! Staff was very friendly and offered suggestions and showed the way to place your order which was appreciated also."}
{"text":"When my coworker first mentioned this place was opening I began to drool uncontrollably. When I pulled up the website and saw the pictures my eyes glazed over and the thoughts of consuming these amazing creations began to take up most of my days. Finally the day of my donut experience has arrived! I jumped out of bed this morning already knowing which donuts I'd be happily forking over whatever price they wanted in order to scarf down (ps- the price wasn't bad at all!) Arriving and ordering was all a blur as once the smell of hot donuts hits you, there is no room for other thoughts. But eating them? The lemonade donut changed my life, I'm pretty sure I can never settle for another donut shop again. And then the salted caramel, because I couldn't stop with just one. So warm, sweet, flavorful and delish!! Fractured prune- I love you."}
{"text":"We drove thirty minutes tonight to check this place out. Unfortunately, a gentleman greeted us and a few other customers by saying, \"our fryer cook went home. The oil is too full and I had to turn it off\". We were not able to get any donuts. I totally understand safety comes first but I would assume he would have at least passed out coupons or vouchers to come back. I'd still love to check this place out but am disappointed in the customer service."}
{"text":"This was my first time here - a friend of mine was in town from Scotland and wanted to try an authentic american doughnut shop. The process of selecting and designing the doughnut was fun and was low pressure since we were the only ones in the store. In the end we selected 3 and designed 1 doughnut. They were good and worth the stop. 

However, we waited to eat them until we got home and were disappointed to see only 3 doughnuts in the box. The doughnut my friend designed was left out and since I live over half an hour away it wasn't worth it for me to return or even call the store. Honest mistake - but had to deduct a star."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious. The donuts are perfectly soft on the inside with a nice crusty outside. With 19 glazes and 14 toppings the flavor options are almost endless. Definitely a good choice for dessert, special treat or just to hang out and watch donuts made fresh. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place! Fun atmosphere, great toppings and donuts were moist and delish! Had the bacon bomb! Maple glaze was great! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Q: What do you see when the Pillsbury Dough Boy bends over? 
A: Doughnuts. 

Gosh.  How crude.

;)

Anywho, so Fractured Prune is the beloved make-your-own doughnut place where they fry up the doughnut right before your eyes and glaze it with what you want and top it with whatever you want as well!  If you're lazy like me, you can get one of those pre-made and equally delicious combos.  We got the Morning Buzz (mocha glaze & Oreo) and the Salted Caramel (caramel glaze & sea salt) to share.  I will admit that the Morning Buzz was ridiculously better than the Salted Caramel only because the Salted Caramel was tooth-rottingly sweet whereas that mocha glaze on the Morning Buzz was like heaven.  Mmm!

The doughnut itself is pretty light but compared to eating a couple of croissant doughnuts the day before, I felt they were a little heavy.  Not a bad thing but I think croissant doughnuts have spoiled me.  Not a hater though, I'd totally stop in to Fractured Prune again if I were in the area,  You just can't beat a freshly fried doughnut!"}
{"text":"Like some other reviewers, I am not traditionally a fan of cake donuts.  So when my co-worker brought three boxes of these gems into work, I was not intrigued until I looked at all of the different flavor combinations and heard all my co-workers raving about them.  So I had to try one.  The one I picked: Caramel Bliss -- a freshly cooked cake donut drizzled in caramel and sprinkled with micro mini chocolate chips.  Amazing!  The donut was soft, light and fresh -- not dense like cake donuts usually are.  And I'm also not a huge fan of chocolate, but the tiny chocolate chips sprinkled on top of the caramel were not overwhelming chocolaty.  Very good, and I would try again!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh Fractured Prune. I have NO idea what your name means but you have won my heart. This shouldn't even be referred to as a \"doughnut\" store. They are little delicious poofs of cake in your mouth!! On a good day, I can throw back 2 of these bites of heaven in one sitting. (Or maybe that's on a \"bad\" day cuz I sure feel like a glutton afterwords.) For those who have not already experienced the Prune, you can order off a sheet of either pre-designed donuts, OR, you can create your own! You select your glaze and your toppings. My favorite custom doughnut is a chocolate glaze with coconut and sweet sea salt. Oh ma gawd!!! Yeah. You're welcome. Anyway, I order off the list sometimes too. They feature things like OC Sand (om nom nom) Salted Caramel, Death by Chocolate (whaaaaa??) and Cookies and Cream. You can order a big box of a dozen or like I do, just stop in for a quickie and eat one (or two!) there. There's seating inside and out and the best part of course is that you get to watch them makes these fresh to order right in front of you! Oh sweet baby Hey-Suse! When your donuts are ready, they are warm and dripping with sprinkled toppings that are like Christmas in your mouth! Today, I had my dog in the car and waited outside, but those doughnut angels delivered my box right to me! I am actually kind of glad that there are only a couple of locations because if this place was closer to my house, I'd probably weigh 200 lbs. Just sayin'. Ughhh. Just scarfed down 2. I need to lie down."}
{"text":"Yum! This is such a cool place! Doughnuts were fresh and delicious! Staff was really nice and friendly! They are a little pricey but delicious and worth it! I would go back (not too often ) and recommend them to my friends!
I went on a Sunday mid-morning and I was the only one there so it was super quick too!"}
{"text":"Hope this place makes it in the current location. We've been hankering for something to make it here and this may be the place. The name is truly funky, but it's a chair from the Midwest, so go figure. Walk in and be welcomed by amazingly friendly folks and place your order for hot fresh frosted donuts. Loads of choices and combinations for your crispy frittered delight... enjoy my friends... enjoy."}
{"text":"I love that every donut is made fresh and is always warm! The option to customize your donuts is a plus! My girls are teens and love The Carnival (vanilla glaze with lots of sprinkles) while I tend to go for the cherry glaze with chocolate chips (Cherry Chip). A nice occasional treat anytime of day!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a donut person - but the donuts here are hands down the best I've ever eaten, in fact if I could eat these everyday I would! 

Love the idea of custom building your own donut! The two times that I've gone it was mid-day so there wasn't any wait however; I can totally see this place being packed on Saturday and Sunday mornings. 

The staff is friendly and always willing to help offer suggestions. The cost is pretty pricy for a donut - but worth it! 

I saw that they now have breakfast sandwiches on a cake donut. It may not sound all that great - but the picture looks so tasty! Can't wait to try it.

Be back soon!"}
{"text":"The whole set up at Fractured Prune is cool.  You get a menu and get to choose your toppings and glaze.  Then they make you a fresh donut and build it to order.  Very fun!  

We tried three different donuts.  One was the donut of the day, one was a FP favorite and the third was a combo I decided might be good (key lime and nilla wafers).  

I didn't really think there was enough glaze on these donuts.  They were so dry!
Still, the donut itself had a good flavor to it.

I am not a fan of cake donuts, though.  They are so heavy!  I ate less than half of my donut, which is very uncommon.  

I would bring my daughter here because she is a fan of cake and buttermilk donuts.  She might enjoy the concept of choosing her own toppings.  I wouldn't come here by myself or to order donuts for takeaway, though.  They're just too heavy and dry for my tastes."}
{"text":"WOW!! We were going to hit Krispy Kreme when we stumbled upon this place! 

Their donuts are fresh light and cakey.  The literally make them for you from batter right there.  The idea of customizing your own is like novelty ice cream in donut form.  You can even add ice cream to your donut selection.  

We are going back Wednesday for their $12 dozen and we want to try one of the donut breakfast sandwiches. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Wow. I love their donuts. 

Unlike other location, their donuts are not premade. They make it as you order it. It is rich, thick, and absolutely delicious. It is a bit too sweet for my taste bugs..but it surely was delicious. I had a plain, snore and banana cream donuts. I like the plain one the most. The other two are too sweet but still delicious. 

The store is very clean, organized and staffs are very friendly. If I am in the general area, I don't mind stopping by here again."}
{"text":"If you are a doughnut junkie this IS the place for you! Never-ending choices for toppings on your doughnuts that are fresh and delicious.  Everyone who works here is genuinely pleasant, very helpful and a joy to encounter. It can get a little pricey and they only make cake doughnuts. Give The Fractured Prune a try, it a great departure from your run of the mill chain doughnut shops."}
