{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. I used to recommend but can no longer. Bad service from a surly waiter, corn tortillas that were cold, carnitas that were over done and salsa that was bland. I recommend going to Unica now . Too bad since Chico's used to me my fav."}
{"text":"This is our first trip to Chico's & we will definitely be back!   The lunch specials were good,  & I ordered the lunch fajitas.  My wife ordered the Rosa Margarita that was on special.  Both were really great sizes,  which we were happy with (some places give you a great deal less in portion for items on special).  The booths were comfortable & the decor was interesting and added to the Mexican atmosphere, along with the music.   The food was phenomenal and the service was fantastic.   The only reason for 4 versus 5 stars is that the fajitas weren't sizzling.   Maybe that's being a bit tough,  but it's a thing; fajitas should come out popping. The food wasn't cold by any means,  just no sizzle.   As big fans of this style cuisine,  we're very pleased with our service."}
{"text":"Never again. Got food poisoning and have been barfing up my food. I feel awful and even had to miss work. Avoid!"}
{"text":"AMAZING service! The staff is super friendly! The food was prepared very quickly! This is defiantly an authentic Mexican restaurant. HUGE portions! I got the beef chimichangas, and they were to die for!!! Favorite Mexican restaurant ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Veracruzana is delicious. Chicken breast with pablanos on top. Pretty standard mexican joint. Good service. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Food is ok medi-oker... The waitress was nice. Cheese dip is a bit expensive for it to be watery. Over all if you get something basic it is worth it but the more expensive food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Arrived in town late in the evening and chico's was close by. Yum! We started with hot crispy chips and salsa with fresh cilantro and just the right amount of kick . Shared the steak and chicken fajitas (for one, not two) and it was delicious, sizzling hot, and more than enough for both of us. We will be hoping for an opportunity to try out some of the chicken dishes ."}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican experience ever. We found 8 bugs in our margarita's and the wait was over an hour.  We simply ordered taco's and they came out soggy and cold. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Awful Food and even worse service! An uninterested waiter who should have gone home. The corn chips were stale and probably fried in stale oil. The corn enchiladas were overcooked with the ends impossible to chew. The cheese dip had to be sent back (when we were able to flag down the server) since it was so cold. My son, who came home to visit, looked forward to eating here since he used to eat there regularly when he was with the Huntersville EMT. How VERY disappointing. Will not eat here again. We should have gone with our instincts and left for La Unica before we ordered our entrees."}
{"text":"Food was good, but I noticed the tax being charged was higher than what appears to be correct from viewing online information. Tax charged was 9.25% instead of the 7.25% stated for Huntersville, NC on the internet. This means they are getting an extra 2% off each customer through deceptive means and fraud. BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Delicious and very fast! My husband loved the shrimp fajitas. I had a tasty taco salad. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"We dined here on Sunday evening.  Having visited before we knew their food was good and the atmosphere is nice. It is located in the Food Lion shopping plaza on exit 23 off of I77.   The reason it is getting a 3 star is because this time we went we had the rudest server.  He messed up several things and constantly cut us off when we were asking questions.  The very, very nice manager came out from behind the bar several times when he saw us sitting at our booth without drinks,  chips, etc.  We never complained but he did mention the server was new.  Still, his rudeness was unalled for.  Also, the ladies room was out of both time paper and paper towels and had litter all over the floor.  Definitely worth a try though,  their food is very good and the chips are some of the best around, so light and crispy and not greasy"}
{"text":"Definitely worth giving this place a chance regardless of what you read or even experienced in the past. Realize every Mexican restaurant has something unique to offer and this one is no different.  

I didn't like it the first time I came here but I decided to have an open mind and try it again. Now this is my Tuesday evening destination...TACO TUESDAYS. Along with  $2.50 pints and $3.99 house Margaritas.

Give it try! Once you keep returning they make you feel like part of the family. 

That's my 2cents!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Huntersville for a quick lunch. Quick service, decent food and price, especially on their 5 dollar special days."}
{"text":"Love chicos!  Think they recently changed ownership and even better than before.  Always fresh food & good service.  Even makes specialty drinks"}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with this place at all.  The salsa was bland and virtually tasteless, and the chips were very \"commercial.\"  The food, itself, was also very ordinary, and what was place on our table was not quite like what was advertised on the menu. 
I liked that they had vegetarian options, but I did not like that their beans were advertised as \"vegetarian,\" but were made with lard.  That's not vegetarian.  It was obvious they do not understand what vegetarian means.  
I did not like that I ordered the #1 from their vegetarian section, and it was not like it was supposed to be.  Yes, I got all three items advertised, but the tostada was supposed to have beans and cheese on it.  Mine had no cheese, but, instead, had sour cream, and a tomato.  The beans were pretty scant, too.  The plate itself looked pretty goo when they brought it out, but it really wasn't.  Just like the salsa, everything was just a bit bland, and tasteless.  My enchilada was more like a half-fold corn tortilla filled with the same cheese sauce they used on the cheesy nachos than it was an enchilada.  
I ate the food, but, I probably wouldn't go back even if I lived in the area.  The $9.00 I paid for that combo would buy a much better meal back in Denver; a meal that would come with rice and beans, too."}
{"text":"First time trying Chico's a few days ago. We were the only ones in the restaurant on a Sunday night! I had the top shelf margarita and 2 tacos dinner- one beef and one chicken. Everything was just average. The top shelf margarita was heavy on the sour, almost too sour to drink! My husbands wasn't as sour, so maybe mine was a fluke. The beef taco was good, chicken was a little flavorless and I did not even eat the refried beans since they came out cold and lacking flavor. I definitely prefer El Toro or Azteca."}
{"text":"My teenagers did not want to try it because the outside looked a little sketchy. However, the food is AMAZING. I grew up in California and am picky about Mexican food. This is good stuff. Loved the nachos. Excellent tacos al pastor. The fajitas taste great. Service totally fine and kid friendly. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the other positive reviews. This is one of the worst Mexican restaurants I've been to. I have no interest in returning. The hostess looked pretty miserable about being there and half-heartedly greeted us. The complimentary \"salsa\" is literally tomato paste from a can. When we asked for a spicier salsa (ie., something that resembled real salsa), the waitress laughed as if there was some kind of joke that we weren't in on. We were brought what I can only assume was blended wasabi and green pepper. Strange consistency for a salsa.... The main course was average. I guess they gave a lot of food for the price, but it looked sloppily put together on the plate. My burrito was lukewarm. I asked for no peppers inside, but there were peppers inside. The only thing I liked about this place was its decorations."}
{"text":"Used to be one of our favorite go to places. Unfortunately the service and kitchen have really declined. Don't know what's going on."}
{"text":"I make it a priority to eat here every time I'm in the area. Never been disappointed in anything here. The food is great, and they're always quick."}
{"text":"It's always fun to break out and explore new parts of the Charlotte Metro, so I took some time to visit my neighbors to the north in Huntersville. Chico's has been a long time favorite of my buds and now, it's a favorite of mine. While it is partially hidden from Statesville Rd, (in the Food Lion shopping center), you will not forget where it is when you set your sights on your return trip! You are always greeted with a smile, typically from the owner, and are served quickly. Everyone receives complimentary fresh chips and zesty salsa. I'm very much an enchilada kinda girl and my friend is a borderline vegan, so we traditionally stay close to those entrees and I have never been disappointed... Truthfully, I haven't often swayed from Enchiladas de Mole because they are that good!  The food is always hot and looks appetizing. I haven't experienced personally, but I have heard that the 'street corner' tacos rival the best you can get in any food truck. Whether you are a local or are passing through to go to LKN, make sure to stop by Chico's for some phenomenal and authentic Mexican cuisine!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was awful. It was not busy, it took about 45 minutes for our food. I knew it wasnt going to go well 25 minutes after we ordered and our waiter came back and asked \"do you guys order yet?\" and retook our order, and then took another 20 minutes for our food (a burrito and 3 tacos). The manager walked around quite a bit but never checked on anything. Only time we spoke to the manager was to fix our bill after the waiter rang us up for the wrong amount. Didnt seem like they were on top of anything."}
{"text":"Great service! Refilled chips and salsa each time we were low and the food was out quick!  

Food is great and server was friendly!"}
{"text":"Great find for tasty cheap Mexican food in Huntersville! Our favorite Mexican place hands down. Service is always very fast and comes with the perfect amount of \"check-ins\". Food has always been great as well. They are great at making sure you always have chips and salsa! Must try for Mexican in Huntersville!"}
{"text":"LOVE. My favorite mexican restaurant, way better than la unica. The mole is great, flavorful and not too sweet. My favorite thing to get from there. Everyone has been super nice when I've been. All the food has been delicious. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Not my typical go to for Mexican but they are good. I've been a few times out of convenience. My carnitas tacos were good , rice and beans were ok. But the surf and turf chimichanga is delicious a pleasant surprise. That sums up my experiences here good to delicious depends on what you order."}
{"text":"The place was dirty. Also, I ordered enchiladas with mole and they were terribly dry. Very chintzy on the mole. The picture in the menu showed a generous portion of sauce but I was lucky to get a few tablespoons!"}
{"text":"This is our go to local Mexican restaurant. Have tried many items on the menu and haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"Man, is this place fast.  We had barely sat down before a basket of chips and salsa was placed on our table.  Drinks and food came out super fast as well.  This is only impressive because we weren't the only people in the restaurant.  

I got a strawberry margarita.  I think the single serving is 16 oz?  If I love anything about most mexican restaurants, it's margaritas the size of your head.  It wasn't the BEST margarita I've had (meaning it wasn't as boozy as I like) but it wasn't terrible.  

I generally order one thing at any mexican place, and that is a chimichanga.  Because, you see, it's a burrito.  And who doesn't love a burrito.  But...but it's....FRIED!!!  I've had some pretty bobo chimichangas at mexican restaurants that should have done better, but THESE were perfect.  Simple, satisfying, delicious.  

This is one of those places that's kind of hidden in a shopping mall, that you'd never think to go in because it occupies a space with a Food Lion, smoke shop, and little nail salon.  But if you have the opportunity, definitely check out this little place."}
{"text":"Great value and excellent Mexican food.  Enjoyed the mixed platter fajitas.  Only complaint is that they don't have anything but house margaritas that we could tell.  But we ate a large, flavorful meal for two for less than $50 for two so no complaints."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and on a Friday night at that.  The restaurant wasn't crowded, but had a good amount of people.  They only had a hightop for a one person party, though there were booths open, perhaps no waiters, but I thought that was odd on a Friday.  I ordered the chile rellenos with cheese, and it took awhile to come out, but that didn't seem unusual as the same was happening at other tables.  The chile rellenos were not fried, they appeared to be deseeded and stuffed, then broiled in the oven. The chile meat (looked like a poblano) was firm, and some of the cheese not melted.  My waiter said it's how they make them.  Still tasted good just not the rellenos I was after, and their beans and rice were a good size.  A little slow to deliver the check as well.  I'll be back to try something different next time, I'm just glad the tv was on."}
{"text":"Tried several items at our table and nothing was what we would call good. For example:

Cheese dip- was prob the best thing we ordered. But still just okay. 
Chicken street taco - very dried out chicken
Cheese enchiladas- very cheap tasting cheese and covered in a yucky tasting brown sauce 
Free chips & salsa - salsa tastes like out of a can
Chicken quesadilla- used pulled chicken in a broth so was wet and flavor wasn't very good. 

Some things were eaten because we were hungry and some after 1 bite were not. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Great environment. Nice atmosphere. Food was excellent. Fresh. Medium priced. Great value. Tango took care of us."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a fluke because it was close to a really cool fish store I started going to. Since then I have been back several times with my family. The food has always been good large portions with a nice selection. They even have a low carb option for fajitas that I have never seen elsewhere. The restaurant is nothing fancy so I wouldn't go for special occasions or first dates, but a great place to take your family to for good Mexican."}
{"text":"This is just your average run of the mill Mexican restaurant with the exception that it is much higher priced.  I will say the service was great and much better than other places that I have visited.  However, there is nothing special about their food.  It strays far from being authentic Mexican food and leaves a lot to be desired.  Once again when it comes to street tacos, it has no competition for the very authentic and delicious Taco Truck in Huntersville.  In my opinion, save your money and either prepare your own food at home or hit up the Taco Truck."}
{"text":"Pretty good place - I've eaten here twice! I ordered the chicken tacos last time- outstanding! But ordered the shrimp this last time - great but lacking the shrimp. Chips are fantastic .... Very fresh! I would go back again. Great service!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant multiple times, and view it as somewhat of a diamond in the rough. The food is quite good for the price, and I would highly recommend the street tacos. At a few bucks a piece, they are simple, authentic, and very tasty...the perfect combo of grilled meat, cilantro, and onions."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! I recently came here for lunch. The food was delicious. We had a great waiter that assisted us in ordering!"}
{"text":"This unassuming, strip mall restaurant is a case where you can't judge a book by its cover.  The food is really good, the service is good (can be slow when its on a busy weekend night) and the margaritas are down right tasty.  My cousin will even drive two hours to meet us here for dinner.  The cheese dip is always the first thing I order and there never a shortage on the chips and salsa.  The Arroz Con Pollo is one of my favorites and during the Winter, I highly recommend the Tortilla Soup....even get it in the Summer sometime.  Great lunch specials.  Definitely my favorite spot for Mexican in Lake Norman.  I ventured away to try La Unica one night and never again will I make that mistake.  Looks like they have a new menu with some new additions that I am anxious to try or the pictures just looked really good and I didn't know they had it before :)  Definitely worth a trip to try at least once."}
{"text":"When I'm craving Mexican, Chico's is always the answer. The food is absolutely delicious. My favorite entree has to be Alambre de Mar. It's grilled chicken smeared in cheese dip with half a dozen of shrimp on top and rice on the side. The service is always great. They always have drink specials! My family and I always come right in between the lunch and dinner rush, which works out great!"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic, great service and I AM CRITICAL! It's rare I don't send my plates back. I'm from the west coast where mexican food is a competitive market. CHICOS HAS THE BEST MEXICAN AND THE PRICES ARD FAIR! Just don't try their fried ice cream, tasted a bit like they're taking shortcuts on that. Nonetheless there entrees are to die for!"}
{"text":"I called Chicos on Wed. 5/3 to make a reservation for Fri 5/5 for a group of 10 at 6:30. Knowing it was Cinco de mayo, I made sure the young lady took my name and phone number. 

When we arrived I was told by the hostess  that they don't take reservations for Cinco de mayo and had no table available. I told her that I called and made a reservation. She said \"Oh you're the one. The young lady was a new employee and made a mistake taking the reservation\" I told her that I gave my name and number; when they realized their mistake why didn't they call. She had no answer and said sorry  but they couldn't accommodate our group for at least an hour.

Members of our group have eaten there many times and felt very put out by their attitude. I then called Chili's and they were able to accommodate.

Will probably take Chicos off my list of regular places to go."}
{"text":"My new favorite local Mexican restaurant!! Never too busy so you can always get a table (at least every time my husband and I have gone)! Great drinks! Try the Mexican Moscow Mule!"}
{"text":"I have made the mistake of avoiding this place for years, assuming it would be low budget. I was very wrong about my assumption. While it's nothing to look at inside or out, the food was actually quite good. I don't normally give five stars for a place, but I did for this place because it's a hidden gem for Mexican food in Huntersville. I'd choose this place over La Unica any day."}
{"text":"It's not very hard to cook Mexican food. The quality of the food and staff wasn't so great there. I have had better."}
{"text":"Love, love Chico's!  Service is usually pretty good, food is great and bar specials are great!  We meet friends here with all of our kids and can hang out for a little while.  They have great bar specials, the margaritas are really good.  There is tons of seating and they are always able to accomodate bigger parties.  We frequent this place for sure!"}
{"text":"I  am not from this area so this is my first time going to this place. I was kind of hesitant when we first went inside because the air-conditioning was out and it was rather warm. I soon realized this was something that would be overcome rather quickly. We were met at the door friendly young lady quickly seated at a roomy table. Our server came to our table after a few short minutes and took our drink order. He gave us plenty of time to look over the menu which I personally prefer instead of the server asking us constantly if we are ready to order.
We started with an appetizer of chicken Flautas which were about of this world. For my entree I ordered the Chicken Taco Dinner. When the order was served I was quite surprised to find out that they were fluffy taco shells vice the traditional hardshell tacos. They were good but I won't say great. I would have liked to have had more meat but they were tasty.
All in all I personally feel that the very negative reviews that this restaurant has received are unfair. Everyone we met was friendly the food was served hot and everything we ate was good. and I really did love the Flautas"}
{"text":"I'm from southern California and can't seem to find decent Mexican food. I've been to all of the high-end places in the area and they're offering overpriced bad food. Great chips and salsa very authentic. I ordered the carnitas plate. Everything was excellent from the tortillas to the carnitas. My wife ordered the chicken fajitas which were also excellent. Granted I'm new here but this is my new favorite restaurant in all of Mecklenburg county. Also, the staff was very friendly and the food was well priced."}
{"text":"We were craving Mexican food and stopped by this gem hidden in a strip mall. This was just what we were looking for! Authentic Mexican cuisine at an affordable price. It didn't hurt that it was grande margarita night either! This will definitely be on our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Had heard some good things about Chico's and thought that I would try.   It was not a good experience.   

Came in on a Friday night and were seated quickly.   It took a few minutes for the server to come over but no big deal.  

Provided the complimentary chips and salsa and should have left right then.  The salsa wasn't that great and tasted very ketchupy. I chose a staple which was the carnitas plate.  I will tell you that the meat was done well but didn't have a ton of flavor.   The refried beans were runny and the rice had no flavor whatsoever.  What is that?  

I would not recommend"}
{"text":"I expect good service when I go to a restaurant and today was just terrible. So I walk in for lunch and they are not busy. Only 3 customers. The hostess greets me and starts walking me to my booth. Before I get their a young waitress walks by and says NO I don't want any more tables then start talking in Spanish. The waitress said YOUR waitress will be right out. Minutes later the same waitress who said she didn't want any more tables is my waitress. I love to get margaritas at Mexican restaurants because they Should taste the best. So I ask the waitress what are your drinks specials. She doesn't know. Then I said what margaritas do you have she don't know. The whole time she is a laughing and looking confused. I guess she's not old enough to drink but if you are going to be waitress your Should know the drink menu. So I ended up ordering Water because I couldn't get any information from the waitress for drinks. Management you just lost money because I can here specifically to drink margaritas!!!!! So I order the chimichanga. When she brings the food out she walks all around the restaurant and finally gets to me and ask Is this your food? I'm looking at something covered in lettuce tomatoes and cheese sauce I didn't know!!! So I told her what I order and she confirmed this was it.  She walked off and started watching tv and texting on her cellphone. Soon the kitchen staff came out and started watching tv too. Does anyone work at this place. I won't be back. Had to ask for napkins. No refill on drinks and before I could finish my food she asked me was I done.  Ughhh. Tip is: hire better staff."}
{"text":"Came back here after some time. I've been here before with some friends to watch soccer. The service was good and in town tonight so decided to re visit.  Got a custom made burrito mushroom veggies and avocado.  It was delicious! I got a Dos Equis amber and my friend got the special margarita because it is Friday.  She got the carne asada tacos and said they were alright, not fantastic but good.  The waitress was courteous and engaging.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"We've gotten take out from here many times. A few weeks ago when I called the order in, they told me there was a new menu. We were ordering something from old menu and they were still able to make it. Everything was fine but prices have gone up quite a bit. Tonight we called in and the phone rings a long time before an answer. They take the order and my son goes to pick up. He got home with food and half of an entree was missing. I tried calling but can't get an answer. My son goes back and they immediately know why he's there. The other part had been made just not included. No one apologizes. I don't know if there is a new owner or manager but service has gone downhill. The food is decent but not worth the higher prices and lack of service."}
{"text":"The food was great. Fresh and tasty. And the service was fast and friendly. A great stop close to the highway."}
{"text":"Fresh lime margs. Fuggettaboutit. 
Walking distance from the hotel.  GTFO. 

Be about it. Great service, better than good food."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I was a little hesitant to come here on exterior looks alone. But a friend persuaded me to go and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious and you get a large amount for a decent price. Service was quick and they are very friendly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Officially made the switch from La Unica to Chico's. 

Chico's is so much better. There's never a wait, service is always excellent and the food is always fresh and comes out hot. 

I typically get the al pastor tacos or burrito but everything is good. The mole enchiladas and smothered burrito are two other favorites. 

It doesn't look like much from the outside but definitely give Chico's a shot! It will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal for the price! Service is usually speedy and courteous. Free chips and salsa at every table."}
{"text":"So I found myself with some time to waste in Huntersville.  I was hungry but there was so much traffic that I quickly got overwhelmed with the tiny, slow streets and all the cars so I pulled into the nearest shopping center and saw Chico's and decided that was my refuge.  I walked in and it seemed kind of dark but they were friendly and welcoming so I went on in.  I was seated near the bar and noticed many tables full of lunching people which I took as a positive sign.  The sweet tea was delicious and arrived in a giant glass which I'm always a fan of  :-)  the salsa had a kick to it so I ordered some pico de gallo and it was perfect.  My dish arrived quickly and it was so colorful and pretty.  it was also very tasty, I ate most of it and then more chips and salsa.  This little place was a hit for me and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I went to Chico's when I saw they had free kids meals. When i got there I saw a sign that said kids meals 99 cents with adult dinner. It was lunch time so my husband and I ordered off the lunch menu and we ordered for both kids. Didn't really care for the food. The kids like theirs. I didn't like the cheese sauce they smothered over my taco. Time  for the bill they charged us full price for both kids meals. One would think the waiter would have stated the kids would be full price if you ordered from the lunch menu. If we would have known that my husband and I would have simply shared a mean and the kids would have shared one too. Bad communication on the restaurant's part. I will not be returning. They left a sour note in my mouth."}
{"text":"Chelsea v Barcelona football or USA v Korea curling on the TVs, you gotta love it. Got tired of traffic on Statesville Road for a change and thought dinner would be a good alternative to road rage.
Walked in and got a seat at a hi-top in the bar away from the glare trying to cut through the shades. Settled in to watch some curling with a basket of warm chips and chunky salsa plus a refreshing margarita and a large glass of water... so much better than yelling at traffic!! Asked for Enmoladas: 3 shredded chicken enchiladas and special house mole sauce topped with cheese. Comes with rice & lightly cheesed black beans. Enchiladas were hot and moist and delicious; needed a knife but not much effort to cut of little bite sized pieces. Chickens was tender and flavorful and well suited to the mole. Hard to mess up beans (especially black beans) which is part of why I like 'em so. These were good and hot and served in their own little cup :-) and oddly enough I didn't spill any on me, yea!"}
{"text":"If there ever was a Mexican joint that needed a Speedy Gonzales special, Chico's is it - they are definitely fast. We were in the area looking at cars (How is it we look at so many cars, you ask? Our kids keep wrecking 'em!). Anyway, speed is useful, but it is not the only category used when judging a joint for your dining pleasure.

In this case, the rest of the place was not great, and I really can't say why. It's not that it was bad, exactly, it just wasn't very good.  Absolutely nothing stood out on the plate. While there is certainly a good thing to not standing out - I mean there wasn't anything bad either - there wasn't anything memorable about it. If I worked in the area, I'd probably visit.

However, I might be just as likely to head across the lot to Taco Bell, depending on whether or not I wanted counter service or the sit-down variety.

Note: I was there before the apparent recent ownership change, so it might be better now."}
{"text":"When I worked in Huntersville, Chico's was one of my personal faves for pretty authentic and super quick Mexican. 

Though inside it looks like a bit like a struggling Chi Chi's, Chico's menu hosts a variety of delicious Mexican fare. While there are a ton of great lunch specials (Huevos Rancheros for $5.50, Fajitas for $6.95), I always find myself going for a few \"street corner\" tacos. Yep, the doubly corn tortilla wrapped envelopes of love. They're small, but oh they are mighty. 

Deets on the street corner tacos from Chico's menu:
Authentic Mexican grilled tacos. Two corn tortillas with your choice of meat. Topped with cilantro, chopped onions, and hot salsa on the side $1.75 each.

Carne Asada (grilled steak)
Pollo Asado (grilled chicken)
Chorizo (mex. sausage)
Pescado (fish)
Al Pastor (pork)
Carnitas (grilled pork)

Personally, I really like the chicken and the carnitas. Delicioso. Two tacos give me a nice, super light lunch for $3.50. Super affordable and tasy. Next time I'm in Huntersville and jonesing for Mexican, I look forward to paying Chico's another visit!"}
{"text":"My wife and I admit we have a problem.. We would drive an unusually long distance for good Mexican food.

So we discovered Chico's about 2 years ago, and this restaurant regularly comes to mind when we have our all too common Mexican \"hankering.\" Chico's gets a thumbs up for tasty food, quick service, and reasonable prices. If you enjoy a spicy experience,  ask for a bowl of their hot sauce with your chips and salsa. It's very tasty.  

Do yourself and your family a favor. Give Chico's a try. You won't be disappointed. Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Missed a side item (Pico de Gallo) on my order, remembered it, then did other things including busing tables rather than completing my order.  

Service was slow in general, and the taste was mediocre.  I sat at the bar on Saturday at lunch - didn't seem to care about me.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the Mexican place we have been looking for! I was a bit hesitant initially to try Chico's but Huntersville is severely lacking authentic Mexican so we gave it a shot. I was so impressed we went two days in a row. The queso is so good and the chips taste nice and fresh! The shredded chicken is delicious. We got beef and chicken
Nachos and the supreme burrito and all of it was great! Lacking a bit on craft beer as most restaurants are offering that, but not a deal breaker. Haven't tried the margaritas yet but we will be back!"}
{"text":"I understand it is the Mexican holiday and you guys are slammed, but I've been here for 25 minutes as well as em the people beside me and we have yet to receive and chips and salsa. Our drinks have also been empty for atleast 10 minutes. Even while busy you should Atleast check on your guests. My drink has been empty while the bartender is talking to a customer sitting next to me and I try to say something And make eye contact and am ignored. I work in the service industry so this service is unacceptable. I know what it's like to be in the weeds and having your ass handed to you, your employees need better teamwork."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food. Great staff and well presented. For the area, this is an excellent Mexican restaurant I has a chicken Chalupa. It was well made and very colorful. I'm the restaurant is very clean and they take all of the condiments off the tables at night and clean them!  This is rare for restaurants to do and got them the well deserved 4th star. 

I would go here again."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer at this restaurant as it typically has decent food at decent prices with good service.  But today's service was horrible.  They had a 20-person party and pretty much ignored the rest of the restaurant patrons in order to service this one table.   I had ordered a guacamole dip and chicken fajitas.  After 30 minutes and going through an order of chips and salsa, I cancelled the guacamole dip.  The fajitas were served 1 hour after ordering.  I contemplated leaving after 45 minutes but figured I would spend more time overall going somewhere else.  Although the server and manager apologized, their apologies came across as less than sincere.  When I pointed out I had been there 1 hour and still didn't have my entree, she mentioned other patrons waited an hour for just a taco.  That's not a good thing honey.  I did get my soda for free (which cost them about 25 cents).  But they've lost a regular customer."}
{"text":"Waiter couldn't understand my english. Gave me cold water even after I asked for lukewarm water. Terrible experience, won't be going again."}
