{"text":"There is absolutely nothing Lebanese about this restaurant located in a shady part of the city's Northeast.  The parking lot has been redone but the buck stops here as far as improvements.

The front door looks like it once belonged to a rowdy biker bar.  The windowless front and entrance have hand written signs for opening hours that run to 3am Depending on the day.  3am for lebanese food, really? Uhuh ok... Sketchy sketchy...

As you enter, the stench of the smoke and fumes of tobacco and hookah are overwhelming in a bad way. On the left side is a lounge where sketchy type smokers seem to hang out on rolling office chairs and old tables.  Onto the right, there was nobody in the restaurant and we sat ourselves in one of the tables until someone acknowledged us.  The worn out and very old decor looks like it was stuck in a 1960's time warp, bloody red worn out  carpets , old brown furniture and dark brown and old  wood panels everywhere.  

Having driven all the way under the guise of very good Lebanese food, we ordered the small tabouli salad ($8) and what came was a disgusting soupy, liquidy, mushy mess that looked like it was put in a blender.  We sent it back and it was not charged on the bill.

For appetizers, and this is supposed to be a Lebanese eatery, they have \"deep fried cheese samosas\" lol they were the same East Indian store-bought variety, filled with carrots and veggies.  A small meat and a separate small spinach pie squares that were baked rounded out samplers for $1.50 each.  They were ok but again, nothing special or authentically lebanese.

Next came the fattouche salad, which consisted of lettuce , cucumbers, tomatoes, deep fried pita chips and dressing. The salad was decent but again subpar to expectations of having fresh lemoney dressing and flavor while the bread to vegetable ratio in this salad was overwhelming towards the bread, not good!!!!!

The mixed grill platter consisting of a ground beef skewer, chicken and sirloin beef cubes, accompanied with rice, fries and a 2oz container of hummus spread and a 2oz container of \"garlic sauce\" had a lot of food for $16, no complaints about the quantity; but that was it.  The fries, which were excellent, were the best part of the meal.  The rice was nothing Lebanese, it was done East Indian style rice with a lot, a lot, of cardemon type spice, yuck!  The chicken was chewy and not the full muscle breast, more like the processed cheap Costco package kind, the ground beef  was ok but the sirloin beef cubes were rubbery And tough, yuck! Yuck! Yuck!

Good thing we didn't order the humus as an appetizer for $8, the little 2oz container that came with the platter was doused with oil and tasted like it was a tahini spread more so than what the chick pea dish it is known for, even the grocery tub at Safeway gets it right but not a supposedly middle eastern family restaurant lol. The other little cuppy of \"garlic sauce\" tasted like a dab of sour cream or mayo with a hint of salt, there was nothing garlicky about it; even the simplest of donair shops have a proper garlic sauce.! Due to the large quantity of rice, fries and having to eat the meat with no bread, we ordered an extra side of garlic well before we had tasted it and found out it wasn't  garlicky, and the charge of the 4oz container was $1.50

The few fountain sodas we ordered were charged at $1.50 each (no refills, really?!?!), They were served in glasses that had more ice than soda, figures! 

While dining, the lounge area seemed buzzing with sketchy looking  people coming in and out amidst a cloud of smoke.  They were by appearance and accent East African and Arabian.  Meanwhile, in the dining room, people were observed coming in and out of the service area without any restriction in plain clothes, cell phone in ear, as if they were part of the ownership's carefree way of operating, very unprofessional and shady!

Overall we are saddened to report a horrible visit In a sketchy area of town, to a restaurant that can be somewhat Arabian in some of the food recipes and ownership but terrible in execution and most importantly, a dump in terms of decor, ambiance, food quality and taste let alone the smoke and questionable lounge side, smoke with the office rolling chairs and the constant people that were in and out carefree that were not ordering food...

Overall, this is a waste of a trip and money.  There is definitely nothing Lebanese or anything worthy about the food and experience at this establishment, keep on driving, NEXT!!!"}
{"text":"Best part was the fries which I rarely eat. Shawarma was overdone - too crispy & very few ingredients. Beef samosas - beef was good but about a teaspoon in a very bready wrap."}
{"text":"Ok so imma put it out there like this, if you love pho, and its a really great recipe, decent price and in a kinda shady area of the city but not the most beautiful restaurant you still go there.  Why because the food is good.  Same principle here, kids.  The food is really good.  Like I would say up there with what you would expect to eat if you were on a patio in Lebanon good.

It appears they took over the old Reef n Beef restaurant that was there and did little in terms of decor or design but I over looked that because of the rave reviews of the Lebanese community in the area who said they turn out some great dishes, and do they ever.  They offer a daily special and even shisha at night.

I know my Lebanese but there is definitely a Syrian influence in the dishes here and although the ambiance isn't great, the food really shines.  We opted for the family mashawi platter that will easily fill a family of four- includes a generous fatoush salad, home made fries (yes hand peeled and cut) and a platter with aromatic rice, roasted onion, tomato and kafta, chicken taouk and steak chunks on skewers.  It was a fair amount of food for like $40.  My only complaint was the steak was a little tough and the rice was slightly over seasoned with what might have been a 7 spice mix, I think a traditional Lebanese style rice pilaf with vermicelli would have been better.

They start you with mezza which includes hummus, pickles and pita with a side of garlic sauce for your meats- like you pay this much for a family of 4 at Rotten Ronnies, so price wise, excellent value for your money.  

We briefly chatted with the lovely owner and she answered any questions we had, and was very quick in delivering the dishes out- first salad and shortly afterwards fries and the main.  We were in and out in about an hour and noticed a few people coming in for shisha but they only serve it after 9 I believe.

If I'm in the area again I will absolutely pop in, perhaps for lunch.  I recently heard they are now offering a traditional Lebanese breakfast!

If you can get over the no frills, hole in the wall appearance and actually try the food you will be impressed, however I understand they have not been open that long so they may be in the process of getting their feet wet before prettying up the place :)

Solid 4 stars."}
