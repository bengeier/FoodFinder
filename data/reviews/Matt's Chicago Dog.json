{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, but mostly forget it's there. I was reminded about the place by some reviews on here that had me wanting to try to they Chicago Dog, so I did. The remodeling looks nice, but I'm surprised they needed to expand their space, because I hardly ever see anyone in this restaurant. On this last visit, at lunchtime, I was the only customer there, but they kept me waiting for quite some time. When I finally got my Chicago Dog, I wasn't too impressed. The bun was very soft, which is a good thing, I suppose, but with all the liquidy toppings on top, the bun just got soggy and kind of dissolved underneath them. I probably won't bet getting that again, but having only tried a couple things on their menu, I may go again and try some more items."}
{"text":"Not the best Chicago dog I've had. It was missing the flavor and the hot dog had a rubber taste. The sweet potato fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"This place could not be more perfect for a native Chicagoan- I may never have to go home again! Seriously Matt's Chicago dog you are the most irreplaceable place in all of Charlotte... Hit this up for a real Chicago dog!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. All I have ordered is the Chicago dog, but it is authentic as they come."}
{"text":"We've been eating there since they opened, between the two of us 4-5 times a week. Obviously we love the place. Everything is good, including salads. So don't think you have to eat hot dogs, although their Jumbo Dog is great. So is the Brat, Hamburger, Turkey Ruben, etc. ."}
{"text":"I am not usually this critical about a place and first let me say the food is good. The price is just a sticking point for me. Example of this is when you buy just  a hot dog and nothing else it could be from $2.79-4.19. This does not include sides (fries or chips) or a drink.   Besides the price, the food is good and the staff was nice. I also had a Italian beef sandwich that was good. All of the meats are Vienna Beef products so nothing was made in house which was a little disappointing expect for the Home Made Chips.   I hope others will have a better experience and the price might not give them pause. I had high hopes and that might have skewed my review."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't even think about walking into a hot dog joint, then I reviewed the menu via yelp.  Much more than just hot dogs. Chicken, burgers, chix  salad, reubens, Italian beef and even BBQ pork. My brother and I were in town for work and needed to get out into the air. Short walk from our meeting, and Matt's is located on the first floor of what appears to be a newer condominium building. The entrance is adjacent to an outside green space area with multiple other shops and eateries nearby.  Fantastic seating outside and ample table space inside.  He went for the BBQ pork and I chose the Italian beef with cheese and hot peppers ( vs sweet). Au jus on the side, a basil based sauce that perfectly complemented the hoagie. Ladies, you'll need the knife and fork provided. Don't attempt to handle this one without 'em.  Well done, Matt!"}
{"text":"I must have been in a haze of goodness that I gave a 4.5 the first time. I was recently in NC to visit my BF's family again and I dragged my boyfriend through Charlotte to all the places i went to with my family in the summer.Number one on my list was Matt's Chicago Dog.   First I want to say, please open one in NY, SO GOOD. The char dog is amazing, just work every calorie and my boyfriend had the Chicago dog..... just superb!!!  Keep it up Matt, its truly a great dog!!!"}
{"text":"As a harsh critic of Chicago style foods this place is really good. The bread on the Italian Beef sandwich was right - not like the chumps who try and give you are hard roll - I like mine dipped and it was nice and soggy.   The wife's Chicago Dog scratched her itch for he home town favorite. Sport peppers were tasty and the dog was nice.   We will be back soon to give the deep dish pie a day in court."}
{"text":"Nice decor, good pizza, sandwiches and hot dogs. A few beers on tap too. Staff is very friendly. My friends from Chicago tell me it's pretty authentic.  A little pricey for a hot dog ($4-6 each), but the quality is definitely there."}
{"text":"Best Chicago Dogs in the Charlotte area -- authentic dogs, italian beef, and more!  Pretty much everything on the menu is good -- deli sandwiches, salads, hamburgers, etc.  Try the chips with ranch dipping sauce as a side!"}
{"text":"last night we received the wrong toppings on our hot dogs and our sides were reversed (we just picked off the incorrect toppings and traded our sides) we got the Chicago style and Carolina. they were just okay. the fries were pretty good. I was actually pretty impressed by the atmosphere. there were tvs everywhere, the lighting was nice, lots tables/booths, a small bar with local beer on tap and it was clean inside. I want to go back and give it another shot, I really want to like this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Founded by accident one day and we travel over 45 minutes at least once or twice a month to get our Chicago hotdog/Italian beef fix. The service there to me is equivalent to Nordstrom they are always engaging with their customers that have positive product knowledge and one ocassion  one of the associates/managers there realize we accidentally forgot of wallets at home and let us eat our dinner and come back at a later time and pay for their meal that to me is exceptional service if you haven't tried match Chicago dog you really need to you won't be disappointed thank you"}
{"text":"We love Chicago Matt's!  My husband is from Chicago and says it's the closest thing to the real thing. My favorite is the Italian beef."}
{"text":"Although the hot dogs are good, I usually end up getting the Italian cheesy beef thing dipped in its own juice... It comes loaded with meat and never fails to fill you up. Sit outside with a side homemade chips and you'll definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I stopped at Matt's for a quick bite while attending a conference.  The location was perfect -- close to the convention center, yet not right in the middle of all of the hubub.  The park was pleasant to walk next to while heading over, but  I was glad to have someone with me who had been there before.  While ordering, the staff was polite and friendly, noting our convention badges and asking where we were from.  They recognized the members of our group that had been there the previous day.  I ordered the two corn-dog combo; others in my group ordered the hot dog combo and the burger combo.  The fries were piping hot and perfectly seasoned.  Our corn-dogs were the perfect combination of golden batter and awesome dog, and the burger and regular dogs were gone before I could ask the others how they were :)  The ketchup on the table was a little low, but I think we were there just after the lunch rush, so that was understandable.  By the time I was ready for a refill on my diet coke before heading out, there was a small line at the register.  The cashier waved me to the front of the line when he saw my cup, so I didn't have to wait while others ordered -- I was highly surprised, and very thankful for his consideration.  I wish more restaurants did that.  One of the earlier reviewers mentioned confusion with picking up baskets right next to the utensil area -- when I visited, there was a young woman running food out (she called the number and waited for the correct person to raise their hands).  It seemed to work much better than having customers pick up their order.    I would definitely recommend Matt's Chicago Dog for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Great food and a pretty diverse menu that goes beyond just hot dogs. Prices are competitive and the staff is super friendly. Serves great deep dish pizza too."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal got the Italian beef with Italian sausage.  Little over priced but good. Would definitely recommend this place to others. ..."}
{"text":"RIP OFF!! Decided to try their new Chicago Style pizza offering. I called and ordered a large half pepperoni and half cheese pizza. Upon arrival, I'm given a 10in mini pizza, and charged $15.00!!!! The menu clearly says the large pizza is 14in....when politely asking about the size mistake, I'm told \"sorry about that, but it would take us another 30 minutes to make it and we're closing now\" It`s 8:30 pm on a Saturday night!!!! With this kind of service, and prices, I'd rather take my chances on a frozen pizza from Harris Teeter!!! P.S. Pepperoni is apparently an extra $2.00....on half a pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Working in uptown Charlotte you won't find a lot of places with out door seating without paying paying more then $10 for lunch. Dean and Deluca is a good example of that. Matt's is nice because it's located right on the green and only a few blocks from Trade and Tryon.    The good: Burgers, hot dogs, milk shakes, and hand dipped ice cream. One of the only places in uptown you'll find a corn dog. Great combos! Matt runs the register which it's nice to be reminded that there are still family run businesses doing well.   The bad: Fries are a little mushy and greasy for my taste.  There always seems to be a little bit of a confusion when you try and get your food from the counter. They'll call your number and you pick up your food with no problem, but they only have a small tiny area for straws, napkins and lids for your drinks, so if everyone else is trying to get those items it turns into bumper to bumper traffic and can become frustrating."}
{"text":"Yes, this is the REAL Chicago dog, complete with Vienna Beef dog. Exactly what Charlotte needs in a hot dog!"}
{"text":"CHI-CAAA-GOOOO *Ace Ventura voice*  Solid place. Line didn't move very fast, so it took a while to get my food, but I guess that could very well be because of the quality. I ordered the Carolina dog and it was fantastic. A little too much slaw for my taste but the hot dog itself was top notch quality. The fries were hand cut, good and hot, but I felt they could use more seasoning as they were a little bland. The employees were all super nice. Cramped seating but I would say better than average for uptown. Plus it's at the green so you can sit outside.   Very good overall, I would go again and would recommend this place if you are in the mood for a hot dog."}
{"text":"Pretty freakin' dissapointed with my Matt's Chicago Dog experience. I went in with no expectations but was excited nonetheless. My boyfriend and I had been scouting it out for a few months and decided to take the plunge. Upon entering, the place was totally empty. We looked at the menu for quite a while and finally decided on the brautwurst for myself and the \"Chicago Dog\" for my boyfriend. We ordered a side of fries and a side of homeade chips to accompany our dogs.  Upon receiving our dogs, I immediately noticed the thick char on the outside of my brat. I usually prefer my dogs a little on the burnt side but this was pretty much all-encompassing. In addition to the brat, the bun was a regular hot dog bun that wasn't even toasted. I moved on to my fries which I found to be soggy with grease and hardly worth the calories. My boyfriend enjoyed his Chicago dog but felt the chips were pretty basic and nothing spectacular. Besides the food, the owner of the restaurant was floating around our booth the enter time and never said a word to us (odd considering we were the only people there). For their namesake, Matt's Chicago Dog is worth the trip I guess but I would not but much stake in anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Reading some of these reviews, it seems like people were expecting a different spot than a hot dog joint. This is a great place to grab a great hot dog, with extremely friendly and helpful workers."}
{"text":"This beautiful experience all started when I walked in. The dude at the counter (you could tell he was a douchebag in times past, that is irrelevant) was so welcoming, you'd question if he was related to you. His name was Chris, we found out later. He was friendly and waited politely for us to contemplate our orders.  I had never been here before, I decided on the basic \"Matt's Chicago Dog\", as the restaurant is named after it.  The cashier saw my uncertainty and he acted on it. Pointing at me he asked:  \"Mustard?\"  I considered this for a second and answered \"Yes\". He nodded in approval of my decision. \"Pickles?\" He questioned, pointing at me yet again.  \"Uhh, yes\" I responded, with him nodding in approval yet again.  \"Tomatoes?\" He asked pointing, and shaking his head in disapproval. He knew what I wanted before I wanted it! How he did this baffles me. This is the peak of human interaction here.   \"No\" I said, confused at how he knew.  \"Relish?\" He asked, pointing at me yet again.  \"Yes\" I shot back  \"Ketchup?\" He asked, pointing at me like DJ Khaled.  \"Yes\" I responded.  And finally, he questioned saurkraut. I don't like saurkraut at all and this man knew this. He didn't wait for a response and just continued on to the final question: \"fries or chips?\" I chose fries as I like fries a lot.  My friend made his order, I didn't pay attention but his was much like my experience.  I paid for me and my friend and Chris, our cashier said \"the wait will be about 3 and a half minutes\" I nodded and we went to get drinks. I got a coke, my friend got a water, as he doesn't like soda.  We began our quest for a seat.  We looked around, the place was surprisingly empty at 6:30 pm. We found a booth for a family of 6 and sat down, looking at the 72 inch TVs.  We stretched our legs, relaxing, not aware of this beautiful experience that was about to happen to us.  We started a timer, waiting for our food.  Exactly 1 minute and 21 seconds later our food arrived.  We began to unravel our food from the wrapping that consumed.  We had a basket full of fries and a beautifully crafted, top shelf Chicago dog.  Unbeknownst to us, we were about to go on another trip.  I took my first bite, and my taste buds were overwhelmed with pure ecstasy. It felt like my mouth was orgasming to the taste of the perfect combination of meat, vegetables, and love. I could taste myself getting happier.  Every bite was another eye opening experience and my friend agreed with me: this is the best hot dog we had ever eaten.  We slowly put the 6' inches of pure glory into our mouths and savored it.  As we finished we got more and more depressed, like a heroin user coming down from the best high of their life.  I finished mine, frowning but recapping this experience.    Then there were fries.  The fries were actually some of the best I have ever tasted, a amazing concoction of salt and potato. These fries are amazing, honestly better than 99% of fries.  As we were leaving, euphoric as ever, a child began crying. Chris looked at the child, and I swear the child stopped crying from the love and support in his eyes. This only added to the experience. I wish I could have tipped, but as you can see I am an English major. I love you Chris xx 704-380-7702   Final review:  Atmosphere: quiet but loud in the right ways, 10/10  Service: the cashier read my mind and gave me sound advice. I give it a \"he probably already knows what he's going to get\"/10  Restrooms: very clean, and had a nice background toon. 10/10   Food: orgasmic. Can I give a 20/10?  EAT HERE GUYS ITS GREAT"}
{"text":"Anytime I find a hot dog restaurant I'm hoping it will rekindle the love I had for hot dogs back when I was a kid living in Cali and enjoying the grandeur of Wienerschnitzel! My memory may have slightly inflated its greatness over the years but I'm still looking for a hot dog that will make me smile like a little boy :)  Even though I'm a native to the City of Angels... the Queen City has made me fall in love with damn near anything \"Carolina Style\". The Carolina Dog at Matt's is made using an all beef skin-on frank inside of a freshly steamed poppy seed bun. Then it's topped traditional Carolina Style with chili, mustard, onion and cole slaw.  The steamed bun was probably my favorite part of the hot dog and the one thing that really stood out to me. For the most part the hot dog was just average. It wasn't OMG THAT WAS DELICIOUS!!!! and it certainly wasn't bad either. It was just an average Carolina style hot dog with an above average steamed bun.  Given the lack of hot dog options in and around the Queen City I'd probably go back to Matt's the next time I'm in the area and craving a hot dog. Otherwise I'll stick to going to JJ's Red Hots or making my own hot dogs over a camp fire :)"}
{"text":"Best hot dog I have had outside of the Trolley Stop in Wilmington NC"}
{"text":"Matt's is a great stop for lunch. I have been here many times and always had great fast service. Contrary to their name, they serve food other than hot dogs...actually I think the majority is something other than a hot dog.  I have had the cheese burger which is good, better than fast food. The homemade chips with a side of ranch are amazing!  I have other friends that have tried other items and love them. This is a must have stop in our lunch rotation. On the healthier side, they have an apple blue cheese salad that is AWESOME. It has huge slices of apple, pecans, blue cheese crumbles, and romaine lettuce with a balsamic dressing. It is one of the best salads downtown!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago born and raised I was extremely disappointed in the Deep Dish. I managed 3 of the largest pizza places in Chicago.   The reason why I gave it 5 stars is because of the other food. It was very good.  The Deep Dish was thin. In Chicago you barely see the crust. You have 2-3\" of cheese and an 1/2\" sauce on top. Mine was barely an inch of cheese and no sauce. The sauce was also extremely sweet which is not how it is in Chicago. It's more of a beer tomato sauce in Chicago.   I will return for the other food. But definitely not the pizza."}
{"text":"I'm in Chicago heaven. Very very close to my chitown foods.  I'm Douglas and I approve this restaurant."}
{"text":"Traditionally good but poor service today including a long time to prepare our simple order and still got it wrong."}
{"text":"Da Bearse! When I was on the road (1985-2005) I would do my best to enjoy the local foods that a particular city was famous for. \"Phiily\" Cheese steak, pizza in Brooklyn, and Salmon in Idaho. My all time favorite \"local\" treat is the \"Italian Sandwich\" Chicago style. Hot dogs are fine, but you can find great hot dogs anywhere. I go for the things that you cannot find just anywhere. Over the years I traveled, I grew very fond of the Cicago style \"Italian beef\" sandwich. There were hundreds of restaurants in and around Chicago, mostly small \"Mom n' Pop\" operations. It never mattered as long as the food was great. Matt's Chicago Dog in Charlotte and Cornelius might as well have \"teleported\" Italian beef sandwiches that taste like they MUST be made in Chicago. Down here we don't have a big \"Vienna Beef\" restaurant like \"Photos Hot Dogs\" in Palatine, but we have \"Matt's Chicago Dog\". All they need is \"Old Style\" on tap and a signed photograph from Ernie Banks and BOOM just like that- you're in Chicago! I never had a bad meal at Matt's, or any of those places in Chicagoland. Thanks to the family for bringing a tasty piece of Chicago to our town."}
{"text":"The product is fine. I have no big issue with that. Your spot is nice. It operates efficiently. I like most things about you. But damn! Your prices are way out of line. $4+ for a chili cheese dog? Are you seriously charging $15 for an Italian beef? That's ridiculous! I grew up in Chicago. I haven't lived there for awhile and I wanted to be fair about my perceptions, so I did a little Google Kung Fu. I searched Portillo's I searched Gene & Jude's. You're not even in the ballpark here. I get it. You deliver a unique experience for the transplants here and I know that Vienna Beef Franks don't come easy in North Carolina. You can do better than this. I'm def. not your enemy, I've supported you since you first opened in Cornelius. I also supported you on \"The Green\" uptown Charlotte. I am happy for your success. But unless you can deliver a little better on the price point, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh. The neon green relish. The crisp, fresh pickle and tomato. The poppyseed bun. The real Vienna beef dog... well, it was a bit soft but in general the food here to me says west 35th, 55th off the Dan Ryan, or even 95th and Ewing if you know what I mean. They've got the lingo. Fresh cut fries, pizza puffs.  Sadly the decor to me says something more like Fullerton and Clark. It's just a little too nice. I know that's a strange complaint. The tables and chairs look right, but that glass-and-brass sneezeguard and the tasteful mural... eh. Its just not tacky enough. I want to see posters of thick eyebrowed women holding up kronos gyros.  I digress. Tasteful decor is not a dealbreaker though. I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't know why I never visited Matt's Chicago Dogs before seeing I work a few blocks away from there and everything on their menu looks delish.  So many hot dog selections and combinations to get I was in information overload. Being a first timer I though it was appropriate got the Chicago Style Dog combo. I've never had a hot dog topped with peppers and tomatoes before so that was a bit funky.....but good kinda funky.   As others have said, the fries were mushy and soft but I am equal opportunity when it comes to fried potatoes and will eat whatever you put in front of me. $6 something for a lunch combo with side (fries or chips) and drink (free refills-holla!) is a great deal in my eyes and you can eat outside if the weather is nice. When I went in for a refill, I noticed the Wunder Bar---chocolate covered cheesecake on a stick. I will most definitely be back for that after another tasty dog."}
{"text":"I love hot dogs but I don't eat them very often.  So when I do splurge for one I want it to be goooood.  This place is right across the street from the Charlotte Convention Center.  We walked in right at Noon.  The line was almost out the door but moved quickly.  You order at the register and they give you a number and bring your food out to you.  Our \"dogs\" which were Carolina style (mustard, chili and slaw) were promptly delivered to the table.  The buns were perfectly steamed (that is so important).  Chili was just right !!!!   The slaw was just a bit too mayonnaise for me but it was good.  We chose the fresh cut fries (just like Five Guys).  Hot and delicious.  This place was a home run !!!  Many hot dog and burger choices.    They even gave us a free refill on our sweet tea !"}
{"text":"I lived in Chicago for about a year and have always liked the Cubs, so it prompted me to go to Matt's when they made the World Series. I use to frequent this place when I worked closer and they are still great for lunch. The restaurant looks fantastic, the Cubs had won so there was a special on Chicago dogs, and the food is still as good as I remembered, if not better. I highly recommended this place if your in the area, it is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love me a hot dog; especially Chicago dog. What makes a hot dog a true Chicago dog...well let me tell you. Steamed or water-simmered, kosher-style, all-beef frankfurter on a poppy seed bun. The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices, pickled sport peppers, and a dash of celery salt. NEVER, NEVER has ketchup. That's like putting ketchup on a Brat...absolute no, no :)   Matt's, also located in Cornelius is great for a quick pit stop. They also have burgers, salads, Italian beef, etc. You can get everything \"Carolina style\" too if you're so inclined. Located on The Green near Aquavina. Great outdoor seating on a nice day!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, probably one of the best turkey ruebans I have had in a long time. Good menu, fair prices, quick service. I will come back again."}
{"text":"I was in Uptown for an all-day meeting and looking for someplace to go on my lunch break.  I decided to give Matt's Chicago Dog a try because I've always noticed the crowds, I love hot dogs, and I love Chicago (I'm a sucker for marketing).    The menu was a lot more extensive than I was expecting and I felt a bit overwhelmed, like being the new kid coming into a school halfway through the year.  Everyone walking in knew what they wanted and how to order.  I, on the other hand, felt like I had to go back to Ordering Food 101.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly and accommodating, though, and walked me through the process.  I still felt stupid, but at least I got to order.    Finding a place to sit was the biggest challenge.  The place fills up during lunch.  Luckily, hot dogs (and other similar items) are usually quick to eat, so people don't stay seated for very long.  The atmosphere doesn't pretend to be a place for \"hanging out\" and talking anyway, so you want to eat and go.    The people working there definitely have a good process, but you still have to wait a little while for your food, as everything's freshly made.  And with the menu and the list of toppings being so extensive, no two things coming out are probably alike.    I got my polish sausage and fries in good time, though, and enjoyed them immensely.  I just wish we had someplace like Matt's near MY workplace, as I'd like to try a lot more on the cheaply priced menu!"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot! The hot dogs are delicious, and the lunch combo is a great deal. It's also in a good location on a small park / courtyard with some outdoor seating options"}
{"text":"Mmm hmm it rivals red hot lovers of Ann Arbor, Michigan. I love a good chicago dog no matter where it came from and Matt knows how to make a good dog."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago originally, so maybe I just have high standards, but this place is TERRIBLE! I have been in on two separate occasions, the food was always pre-cooked, and sitting there \"warming\" when I walked in.  The hot dogs are nothing like the classics you get in the city, which puzzles me because they do use the traditional Vienna Beef hot dog.  The interior of the restaurant is not kept up with, and always seems dirty any time I go in, crumbs on the floor, used napkins about, etc.  After my second visit, I actually took the initiative to talk to a woman who identified herself as the owner, but she was rude, and insulting.  I do not recommend this place to anyone who's ever had the real thing."}
{"text":"First time checkin out Matts Chicago dogs. Headed there for lunch on July 3, they were one of the only places open. I ordered the Carolina dog combo, with slaw and chili. My hubby went with the deep dish pizza. The only problem was that I got my hot dog 15 minutes before he got his pizza so it was cold by the time I ate. Obviously I could have eaten it right away but wanted to wait. I got the sweet potato fries with it and they were really good. Hot dog was okay. I wasn't overly wowed by it, but it got the job done. I actually thought the pizza was tastier. Would come back for a quick lunch, food Is average."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style dogs and Italian beef - just as good as anything you can get from Portillo's!  Been going to Matt's ever since they opened their first store up in Cornelius and been going to the one in Uptown Charlotte since they opened.  Great food, great people at a great price!"}
{"text":"These hot dogs will be pricier than other hot dogs purchased in the immediate area, but these are good hot dogs.  During lunch time, a line will sometime go out the doors and their is a wait as they make your food fresh.  I recommend sticking with their hot dogs and sausages, which are very good quality and taste; the hamburgers they offer are bland in taste.  The combo includes a drink and chips/fries.  Overall, four out of five."}
{"text":"It's got the Genuine Natural Casing Vienna Dog an the Poppy Seed Bun but they are a 1/8 pound instead of the 1/6 pound so the Dog gets lost on the bun.  If Matt would pony up for the bigger dog I'd give him Five Stars. Four Stars for the dog.  The fries were five stars though. Nice fresh cut wit skins still on and crispy as well.    It's more like Devil Dogs and not The Weiners Circle.  It is Charlotte and not Chicago so I might be a little hard on the place.   They do have Coke on Tap and Mexican Coke in the bottle.  Get the bigger dogs and you can get an extra star.   $7 for the small dog and fries plus drink is a bit on the high side as well.  Since its about a 15 minute walk from the hotel we stay at and no car it will see me for lunch again."}
{"text":"Two words.....PIZZA PUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Crispy fried pockets of pizza dough filled with the most mouth watering gooey cheese, bits of sausage and tangy tomato sauce inside. Sooooo good..... Do yourself a favor and get 2 of them and thank me after. I grew up in the Chicago area and everything here is just like I remember it. I just saw that they are now serving Chicago-style deep dish pizza! Can't wait to give it a try. They also have Vienna Beef hot dogs which are literally the best hot dogs you'll ever eat. I like to eat them with fries and cheese. Ask for extra crunchy fries because they tend to be soft, not crispy. Go here, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I am going to keep my rating four stars simply because I love their Chicago dogs, but Matt, do not serve me limpdick french fries ever again or else."}
{"text":"We ended up trying this place for lunch one weekend. Overall the menu looked good when we looked at it online. I totally loved they had smaller pizzas for my little boy.  From reading the reviews, it seems like hotdogs are their thing. I am not a huge hotdog fan, but they had other things that looked appealing, so I decided to get a burger.   Overall the food was average (and overpriced when considering the quality) with the exception of the fries. The fries looked overcooked, but when you tried them you could tell that was just the way they looked and they were just overall not good. I would definitely recommend any other side than the fries.   I am not sure if we will return or not. The food I got I can get elsewhere better and cheaper. However, if my boyfriend was in the mood for a hotdog, I would not be opposed to going back but I would definitely get something different the next time I go."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there yesterday. I've heard a lot of mixed things about this place and finally checked it out. Got two chili cheese dog combos. Was 21.00, I was not impressed at all. Got cheese fries, I'm not sure what kind of cheese they put on it, but it's not good at all. Very greasy and weird. Gave me terrible heartburn. The chili tasted like Horner canned chili and they the shredded bag cheese wasn't even melted on top of the chili. Def won't be craving this anytime soon. Would like to go back though and try the deep dish pizza. Staff was not to friendly either. I don't know about you, but I think the staff at all places where I spend my hard earned money should be welcoming and nice. But that's just my opinion!"}
{"text":"Cashier was very friendly and helpful when ordering  from their menu since this was my first time up here. I ordered the #4 which was the two corn dog combo with fries. Corn dogs were good but the fries not so much."}
{"text":"Hands down, I love this place! True, there's not much in the way of seating, but I generally always get my order to go.  I always get the Chicago dog (no, I'm not from there) & the homemade chips. YUM-O! Hot dog is cooked to perfection, every time. Chips are cooked just right, no undercooking or over cooked. The wait time is next to nothing, which is great for when I am on my lunch hour & need to hurry."}
{"text":"Good deli sandwich. Nothing out of the ordinary. Worth the price. If your deciding between a typical chain and this choose this. Hotdogs might be good since it's in their name."}
{"text":"I popped in here for a quick bite cause who's not a fan of hot dogs??  I took a quick gander at the menu board and after closing my mouth and wiping the drool, I set my mind on the Carolina Dog (chili, mustard, onions and cole slaw).  It was ready within a minute and it was more than I had asked for.  the bun tasted fresh to the point that if it were warm I could've been convinced it just came out of the oven.  the hot dog had a good snap to it but was still tender.  The cole slaw was tasty but a the cabbage, and carrots could've been cut a little smaller.  Same with the onions.    Overall it was a great hot dog.  i'll definitely stop in again before I leave Charlotte."}
{"text":"I ate the most delicious hot dog of my life at Matt's Chicago Dog. And the people who work here are very courteous. Please stop in for excellent food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Having lived and loved my home town of Chicago for half my life, I was going in cautiously. I was really impressed with the decor of the place and the food is really,really authentic Chicago. (I will finish review later)"}
{"text":"I have actually gone to Matt's Chicago Dog for lunch for 4 consecutive weeks. Great place for lunch. They have really fast service seemingly even when there is a crowd. I have made it my business to try a few different things all of the items I've had were great. My only complaint would be on the homemade fries. Be sure to check your order because you do not want them cold. Definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"One of my wife's and my favorite places to eat in Cornelius. My wife always gets the Matt Chicago style dog with all the peppers that come on it. I love their reuben. They have homemade potato chips and fries that are delicious, especially if you get a side of ranch for dipping."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good (not great, but hey, you are in Charlotte NC, not Chicago IL!).  I had the Italian sausage and bratwurst sandwiches; if you come with an appetite, you could easily eat both.  The food was served very hot and the ingredients were good.  They focus on sandwiches, and do not offer pizza like so many Chicago-style establishments do.    Decent food and convenient location."}
{"text":"Always a kids favorite on the weekends between sports. They have a great menu variety in their Chicago deep dish pizza is fantastic."}
{"text":"I have made it a habit to stop by hear AFTRR rowing class with my best friend every Wednesday night. I mean we row hard so may as well reward ourselves with good food right?   Robin and I alway ordered 2 orders of the mini corn dogs. They're to die for. At least for us. The batter is slight sweet but very crispy. Remind me of home in Wisconsin. I alway get these for dogs at the state fair. First time there's I ordered the burgers. Very typical burger. Nothing special. Coleslaw is ok. Cup of fruits which is fruits. Robin ordered the loaded Chicago Dog which she likes a lot. 3 times we came. I ordered the Italian roast beef I think. Anyway, it was off for my taste bud. I didn't like it. But I was starving from the workout so i ate most of it. I wouldn't order that again. Overall, I like this joint. Pretty much a ritual place for us now. Will continue to get the mini corn dogs with new sandwiches and would try their deep dish pizzas soon!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I've found in Charlotte to serve authentic Chicago style food. I've ordered the Italian beef three times, each time the meat was tough - under cooked perhaps to stretch the serving portion. I kept thinking I got a bad batch but the sandwiches are pretty expensive so I won't be giving it another shot. They use Vienna beef so I would suggest cooking the meat longer and giving the customer a decent portion."}
{"text":"We are from Chicago (both Southside and Northside) and this place gets it....the Italian beef was juicy on fresh bread with perfect giardinera and the Chicago-style dog hit the mark. We felt like we were back home. The servers are super-friendly too. We will make the drive up here again soon!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed. I had lunch there today and thoroughly enjoyed it. The bun, bratwurst, homemade sweet potatoes fries and tea were delicious. The couple beside me got their potato bacon soup and they said it was very good. I'm taking my husband next time. The service was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"Sincere Apologies, I had high hopes for Matt's Chicago dog. Brought a local Carolina friend and wanted to take them on a tour of some Chicago food staples. While the staff was nice and friendly, the food is a completely different story.  I'm born and raised in the city of Chicago. I grew up with this kind of food and have had the best to the worst in my hometown. But even the worst is still good.  I see that they were really trying to make it authentic, but fell short in so many ways. We ordered an italian beef hot and sweet and dipped. Chicago Dogs, a Polish, a pizza puff, and cheese fries.  We'll start off with the good. The pizza puff. But it's hard to go wrong with something your order in frozen and throw in the deep fryer. It did remind me of childhood and was exactly what it was supposed to be.  And now the bad. Italian beef: sliced way too thick to the point where the beef was a little chewy and dry. The bread didn't hold up well (the ultimate dip test) and the au jus had something off about it. Missing spices and just didn't taste quite right. Chicago is known for its Italian beef and this is by far the worst representation of the glorious sandwich.  The chicago dog: now you would think this would be the best thing on the menu but it was poorly, poorly executed. First off, the bun was slightly stale. A chicago dog needs the bun to be warmed in a steamer to make it soft and chewy. It was also missing celery salt and a pickle spear. The only thing right about this \"chicago\" dog was the neon green relish, sport peppers, and the poppy seeds on the bun.   The polish: even worse than the chicago dog. There is a difference between charred and burned. But the point is, chicago polish's are not charred. They're done on a flat top or in hot water. Half of it tasted burned, why even serve that to us?  The cheese fries: one bite each and we threw it away. The fries were ok but tasted old, the orange yellowish substance on top of it? It was separated and chalky. Proper cheese fries in chicago has that oh so delicious liquid cheese. And although that's not any closer to being real cheese its still delicious and is how it has been and always will be.  My recommendation, send your cooks to Chicago on a food tour of the items claiming to be served. Have them observe how its done and how it should taste. If you need recommendations, I would be happy to provide.  I'm not a fan of Yelp, but needed an outlet for this epic Chicago food Fail. Again I mean no harm or have any ill will toward the owners, it's just the food did not live up to the name."}
{"text":"For those who aren't getting a hot dog (yes at Matt's Chicago Dog) this is a review for you. I got the chicken salad sandwich to-go for lunch which came with chips and a container of fruit. The bread was great. The filling was okay. I had no trouble eating it for lunch and was relatively filling. There's a good amount of chicken in their chicken salad so not a lot of filler. The potato chips are thinly sliced but not very flavorful (It seemed unevenly salted). I finished off the lunch with a giant chocolate chip cookie which had the right level of sweetness but a bit too hard for my tastes."}
{"text":"I got the chili dog and tater tots. That was pretty good but nothing special.  For our group we got the pepperoni deep dish pizza. It seemed like the crust was flavored and I didn't like it. They also sprinkled cheese on the top which was not something I like either.  I didn't finish my slice even after scraping the sprinkled cheese off.  The ingredients seemed fresh and it might be good if I could special order the next time but we are just passing through, so no such luck."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Matt's in quite some time, and no one cod decide on what they wanted to eat. Well I am from Chicago originally and I miss having a good Italian Beef, a pizza puff, and a true Vienna Beef Chicago dog! When we got there, we were shocked to see how they had expanded!! Beautiful dining area, with a bar even! We ordered our food, and noticed a sign advertising Deep Dish Pizza!!! OMG!!! Finally!! After UNOs had closed down here several years ago, we lost all hope for ever having another Chicago pizza! We decided we would come back on Weds when they have their Buy 1, get one 1/2 off deal on pizzas. We got a Chicago style Deep & a Chicago style Thin Crust. The deep had the full sausage patty that anyone from Chicago, that has been to Gino's, knows that's what a real deep dish pizza is about! The thin crust, wow! It reminded me so much of this local place my family would get thin crust pizza from. The sausage, I've never had any place come close to the flavor! The crust was perfect! Crispy, crunchy.. Delicious!! The deep dish had cheese that was so gooey & melty... Mmm!!! We can't wait to go back!!   Their pizza puff is phenomenal! A must try! Their hot dogs are true to Chicago, and from Vienna Beef so they are just like Portillos. The beef sandwich, get it wet, soaked in the juice! The bun is so good!!!   The staff is super friendly. The chef even came out to talk to us. We definitely plan to go back more often. My husband even says that he doesn't even mind that we're not able to go home to Chicago, when we can have the next best thing here!!"}
{"text":"First time at this location as it's FARRRR from where I live. But I read on their website that they offer true Chicago-style DEEP DISH! Well....just HAD to see for myself.  So I ordered a to-go pizza, with extra sausage (completely unnecessary), mushrooms and roma tomatoes. With all those \"extras,\" this pizza weighed about 1,617 lbs! Well, maybe NOT that much, but this effer was HEAVY! Yup, that's my Chicago deep dish for ya!  Got it back home and we open some vino and partake! Of course, REAL Chicago-style deep dish requires a knife and fork. This pizza qualified as \"real!\" Definitely a fork and knife kinda pizza. When we got it home, it was a tad cold. I should have put it in the oven for 10 minutes to reheat but I was too hungry so we ate it on the spot!  The flavors were excellent! Very much like I remember a Connies or Uno's tasting like.....just still not Giordano's though....Oh well, can't all be perfect! I digress.....This VERY much was a typical Chicago-style Deep Dish.....sausage was done in a large \"patty\" and occupied the entire bottom of the pizza! Tons of mushrooms and EXTRA sausage (Excuse #1: My first time here so I didn't know the ENTIRE bottom of the pizza was laden with SAUSAGE - sue me!). They did add 2x mushrooms and some extra cheese. I don't know how much this bad boy would have weighted if we opted for Door #1....but we didnt' and thankfully this was a seriously bad a$$ Chicago-style pizza!  Definitely RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"I don't visit this place often enough. Love the wet beef sandwich. I've heard the pizza is good also but i have yet to try it."}
{"text":"This place is a Diamond in the rough!  I don't know Matt but he's got it going here!!!!  I have to give give credit were credit is due...  I just had the BEST Italian Beef, Chicago Dog and Homemade Potato chip Ive ever had.  Off the hook good and I will become a regular here like I am at Portellos in Chicago.  Service was great and this place is Clean, clean clean.   It truly is worth stopping in...  you wont be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Die hard Chicagoan here....so my expectations are somewhat \"elevated\" when it comes to food from my beloved hometown. Like Nicole said, is it the best Chicago dog I've ever had? Not even close. Is it the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? I say YES. They've got the traditional ingredients down pat, the Vienna beef sausage (yes, that's what a \"hot dog\" is.....an encased meat sausage), the neon green relish, the steamed poppy seed bun (which is the quintessential defining part of a Chicago dog), sport peppers, tomato, a pickle and MUSTARD (Chicago dogs NEVER, repeat, NEVER EVER use Ketchup!).   So I got a Chicago Dog and a special called the Fire Dog today which was a spicy Polish sausage with grilled onions, brown mustard and I opted for the sauerkraut. It was a good dog, with all the flavors expected. Fries are usually good here, but my criticism is that they lack some seasonings.....hell use Lawry's Seasoned Salt or something and fry them a tad longer to get more of a crisp on them. They're not bad but certainly CAN be better!  Being a lover of Portillos, Mr. Beef and Al's in Chicago, Matt's version of Chicago Beef is just meh.....sausage isn't bad but their beef just isn't flavorful enough for my tastes. I mean it's not bad, just not up to my expectation from what I remember from back home. OK now I'm being picky and critical.....me bad.   For first time visitors, just know that the portions are NOT very big (at least for the dogs). Recommend getting a combo with 2 Chicago Dogs or a combo Beef/Sausage. Even the females in my group complained that one dog wasn't quite enough. Jumbo dog is also an option. They should offer a TWO DOG JUMBO combo for us bigger eaters.  So overall I love Matt's as it does provide me with a LITTLE taste of home. I can only hope that SOMEONE opens up a REAL CHICAGO PIZZA place here in Charlotte....while I love thin pizza, there IS MUCH BETTER out there so please someone, open a Giordano's here! PLEASE! :-)"}
{"text":"Having grown up close to Chicago I was skeptical of this place could make a good Chicago style dog.  However, seeing this was my only option to fill a craving I went for it.  Very good dog and the Carolina dog was on par and perhaps even better.  If visiting Charlotte, go early or later than 1200-1300 to avoid the long lines"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch en route to doing some errands as my boyfriend has been wanting to try it. I ordered a chicken finger combo with cheese fries and he ordered the italian beef and sausage combo. Grab a table our order comes out and They gave me regular fries instead of cheese fries. Easy fix, so I let the girl know. She takes my entire basket chicken included back and stands there and looks like argues with the cook in order to get cheese on my fries. She brings back my chicken which is overdone and says your fries will be up soon. Meanwhile my boyfriend has eaten Half his sandwich only to realize it doesn't have the sausage on it. The girl behind the register had no idea what she was doing and we were charged for food we never got. It would be really tough to get me back there."}
{"text":"Coupled with visits to the uptown Mint Museum we took the grandchildren to Matt's for lunch.  It was extremely crowded so we waited a very long time to place out order at the front counter.  There was a NC state convention of fire rescue professionals who happened to be on their lunch break so that accounted for the enormous crowd.  There is quite an extensive menu of items.  A number of hotdog selections, many sandwiches, some salads and chicken items.  A good menu.  Taking a number that flew on our table, it took some time before our order arrived but the server took in and satisfied any additions or corrections and we were happy.  My egg salad sandwich was excellent, toasted rye bread and a good mound of egg salad.  Iced tea was refillable.  The kids love root beer and they were ecstatic as sodas are not part of their home pantry.  Right across from the museums, there are a number of eateries, Matt's being just one of them.  Matt's was good and the food well done.  A nice break from the museums which can be reentered that day and the next.  The museum ticket was also valid through the next day at the Randolph Road Mint museum, so it is a good deal.  Take the kids."}
{"text":"I will be back for more of this delicious Chicago style pizza. The only place of its type in Charlotte"}
{"text":"I've only been to Chicago a couple of times, and I never had a hot dog while I was there. I went for the pizza instead. If this is how they do burgers and hot dogs up in the Windy City though, I'm jealous.  Matt's Chicago Dog is a great place for lunch, dinner, snack-time, etc. Despite the simple menu, there are a lot of variations on the typical burgers/hot dogs/sandwiches theme.  I have eaten the cheeseburgers and fries here on numerous occasions, and tasted a loaded-down hot dog...very good.   The interior isn't the biggest, and it can be tough to find a seat during lunch rush some days.   However, I've found its worth the wait or adjusting feeding time in order to lap up some of the Chicago-style goodness.  Prices are good too...easily out for under $10, and usually less than that."}
{"text":"Remodeled with expanded menu. Now offers Chicago  style pizza.  Been awhile since I've been, partly because they were remodeling.  They've expanded into the space next to them and opened up the place.  Menu has expanded as well and they have added Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza as well.  I ordered a Polish Sausage Combo and it was very good. Good amount of heat and spice.  The French Fries on the otherhand were horrible.  Very limp and dripping of grease and little taste or texture.  I like their sandwhiches because the a tasty and offer great value.  In the future, I'll remember to stay away from the Fries."}
{"text":"I've been to Matt's now a couple times and thought I had been transplanted back to Mr Beef and Al's with the authenticity of my \"combo\" sandwich.  Had a thin crust pie on last visit and although the sausage and crust were pretty close to Chicago tastes, the sauce could have a bit more zest. It's a tad bland.  Overall, quite pleased to find a place that is not like all the other \"New York\" style places."}
{"text":"I was told about a place that had a killer Italian Beef sandwich. It does not matter where you are, if there is an off chance that you can get something that even closely resemble an Italian Beef, you run as fast as you can. I split an Italian Beef with a coworker and sampled a Chiacgo dog.   \"The Good\" - The hot dog was great! Authentic to the real deal a few states North. - Self serve drinks with free refills. - Open grill for the food is always a nice touch. - Fresh cut fries. - The place was clean, an often overlooked but very important quality. - The Italian Beef... OK Here's the deal. It was a damn good sandwich but did not taste like an Italian Beef from Chicago to me. The giardiniera, although very good, was different than what I was expecting. It was not bad by any means and had a good taste right down to the dipped or wet, they had it locked down. I would say it was a great North Carolina Italian Beef, but not a Chicago one.   \"The Meh\" - Nothing meh to comment on.   \"The Bad\" - Nothing really bad to comment on either."}
{"text":"So I have to say- I am a tough critic on Pizza, especially Chicago Pizza and I've been waiting so long (because of distance) to try Matt's. I am born and bread Chicago and search and search for Chicago pizza here. I have good friends that swear by Matt's, but I'm always leery since they don't know Chicago standards. I couldn't wait any longer- I had to try. Firstly their menu board looks like Portillo's (if anyone knows the Chicago restaurant) and the staff was so friendly and put up with my ridiculous excitement.  The pizza- is beautiful. Cut is squares as the law goes for Chicago Pizza- I wouldnt even try it if it wasn't- and the taste was the closest thing we have in the Charlotte region. Thin, great toppings- most traditional is green pepper, onion, and sausage. The flavor was melded beautifully within the cheese properly, the crust was thin and firm yet not crackery and not too thick. Sauce was perfect and seasonings topped it off well. The end result was a very very happy me :). I cant wait to go back and try the deep dish and the \"Beef\"... if you don't know what it is don't worry- you'll love it!!!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised inside Chicago. I couldn't wait to try this place. I NEVER opt to eat a hot dog.. But a chicago one? This is my childhood!!! It's fantastic, on point down to the pickle, sport peppers and celery salt! We also got a \"beef\" which it just makes me so happy to order.. And she even asked if we wanted it dipped! They speak Chicago!! Thank you for bringing me back.. One day I'll venture to the Davidson location for Chicago pizza. I can't wait!"}
{"text":"The first comment I must note about this restaurant is the interior decorating. It has a different kind of feel and made me feel like I was tucked in a nice decorated alley on a side street of Chicago.   I've only gone here for the hot dogs and that's all I want to go here for. I'm sure their hamburgers are just as delicious, but I've got other places to get that fix. The menu is easy to read and not scattered around. I always go for the combos because it's fast and usually ends up being the cheapest. They range from about $5.50 to $8.50, the latter being a double dog combo.   I can't complain about the dogs. They are made fresh and taste thick and juicy. No squishy meats or filler seen in the dogs I've had. Their fries are just as good and sliced in house and fried when ordered. Can't go wrong with fresh, right? They even have a slogan on the wall that states they use \"no nukes\" for your food.   The place is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. Good place to go for lunch if you're in the mood for a hot dog and fries!"}
{"text":"If you look through the reviews I'm sure you'll see the \"I'm from Chicago this place stinks\". I'm not from Chicago but I've been a number of times and love the their food. Anytime I've been to Chicago a deep dish, Chicago dog, and Italian beef are the only things I'll eat while visiting. I've been to a number of places outside of Chicago that claim to do Chicago style dogs and Italian beefs and this is the only place I'd go again and again. The deep dish doesn't live up to the pizza you'd get in Chicago though, had high hopes for it. Just wasn't quite what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"As a chicago native I can tell you this place is a facade of a chicago restaurant. Living in chicago for over 15 years I can tell you it's a huge sports town. Matt's chicago dogs does not have a single trace of any bears, bulls, blackhawks,cubs, white sox, or fire anywhere. No street signs or any atmosphere. Not even sure there was a photograph of the windy city to be found. The food was mediocre at best compared to Portillo's. Food goes down better when stoned"}
{"text":"Great Chicago dog. Hard to believe he can cram all that flavor into a food truck. Always a smile with fast service."}
{"text":"Matt's Chicago Dog is a great lunch spot. The Chicago-style hot dogs are done well, but I often find myself getting the grilled chicken sandwich and fries (which are the perfect level of greasy and salty). Plus, it's affordable. Lunch normally runs me $7 or $8. Matt's is often packed with Wachovia employees at lunchtime. If you've got a flexible schedule, I'd go there around 11:30 or 1:30 to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"All I can say is.. \"wow\". My husband is from Chicago and we were uncertain how close these Vienna dogs would come to the \"real thing\". We went with family and shared several dogs including the polish dog, Vienna dog, Carolina, and Chili Cheese dogs. All of them were EXCELLENT. The owners made a point of visiting our table while we were there, which made a great impression. This is the best place to visit when you're craving a good dog!"}
{"text":"Good inexpensive eats. The have ridiculous combinations for dogs and burgers and the prices are extremely fare. I will definitely return the next time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great place. Good atmosphere, quiet, clean. Food was tasty and good sized proportions."}
{"text":"I tried their Italian Beef and its \"meh\". Not really close to being what you can get in Chicago, but decent for what is offered in Charlotte. I don't even know if there is another place that offers Italian Beef on their menu, but I would still eat another one here if I was pheenin' for one.   Another Chicago fav is the pizza puff. Not much they need to do with it but fry it. Can't go wrong except for destroying any diet plans and giving you a tad of heartburn for us older folks. One was good enough for me...two might be pushing it. $3.99 each and no option to make it a combo meal.  The cheese used for the cheese fries is an absolute \"boooo!\". I will not try those again."}
{"text":"Today...well, I ate my last ever meal at Matt's Chicago Dog.  Let me start with the positive:  The lady at the counter (younger) is always super nice and helpful and today she even earned a tip from me.  I love the décor of this place, it's really very cool.  I do not think the food is terrible, but for the prices they charge...totally NOT worth it.  $4.89 for ONE chili dog?  That's right, a total ripoff.  For lunch, two chili dogs, fries and a small drink was like $14.00.  The old man, who I can only assume is \"Matt\" and obviously owns the place because he's always there has not one time even said hello to me.  He always has a scowl on his face, looks to be mad about being there, and I've seen him several times be very rude to his \"ethnic\" employees.  I'm easy going, enjoy a good meal and expect to pay for quality.  I don't expect to be ripped off for mediocre and not even get a hello from the owner.  Peace out Matt."}
{"text":"Awesome food! They were very helpful with choosing something. I eventually chose the Italian beef combo and it was delicious! It had plenty of meat and was well worth the price. I recommend getting it wet with peppers and onions. The chips with ranch dressing were outstanding!"}
{"text":"I have not tried everything on this restaurant's menu, but always end up getting one of their delicious char grilled hamburgers.  They are not thin, as another reviewer said.  You may be tempted to get a \"double\", but I assure you, you won't be able to finish it.  I've tried Davidson's \"Char-Grill\", and while the *taste* comes close, their fries are bad, the prices are higher, and the wait is longer.  This is a great restaurant, and I'm glad I gave it a try.  I hope someday Sport Clips closes so they can expand into the spaces next door to them.  It's too small for a lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I finally found a great roast beef sandwich at Matt's! Give me the roast beef with giardiniera and mozzarella all day. Pretty large sandwich; definitely will leave you feeling satisfied. You can have the beef dipped in au jus or on the side. I had mine dipped, which made the bread a bit soggy. Would go on the side next time.   I guess after all the raving about the roast beef I need to try the hot dogs. It will be hard to ignore that sandwich though."}
{"text":"We are from East TN and I wanted to go to Ikea, and since it was my birthday, I wanted a deep dish Chicago style pizza. After a search on Yelp, Jay came up with this one. Delicious! The crust was crisp and buttery, the sauce was fresh (possibly home made)  and the cheese and pepperoni were very fresh as well."}
{"text":"Matt's Chicago Dog is a good choice for those looking for a quick bite at a reasonable price. I tried the chili cheese dog, and would rate it as average.  The hotdog did not have much flavor and the small amount of chili and cheese didn't provide much flavor over the taste of the soft steamed bun. Don't get me wrong, the chili dog wasn't bad, it just wasn't something you're going to tell your friends about.  Prices are fair, expect to pay 10.00-15.00 for lunch."}
{"text":"The staff here was super nice ! We drove here because I really wanted Chicago pizza . While it is deep dish it's not quite like Chicago pizza it's pretty close though and if your in Charlotte or this area and you want Chicago pizza give it a try the staff was really attentive and polite"}
{"text":"Horrible small hotdog. I've never been to Chicago but I'm sure they're not this small. Come here if you're not hungry."}
{"text":"I read all of the great reviews for Matt's Chicago Dog, and as usual, I took them with a grain of salt. What really caught my eye were the reviews from Chicago natives. They stated that the Chicago hot dogs and Italian beef was either a close approximation or a dead ringer for what they grew up with in Chi-town. I woke up Saturday morning with this (somehow) stuck in my mind, so this called for a road trip.  I found the restaurant easily.  The staff was welcoming and friendly.  The menu options were easy to read on the overhead menu board.  I knew what I wanted before I left home, a Chicago hot dog all the way, and an Italian beef, with onions, sweet AND hot peppers, dipped. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-chicago-dog-cornelius?select=dbHpU-kSLiSb46kgygvzcQ#dbHpU-kSLiSb46kgygvzcQ  I have tried to cultivate a taste for Chicago style hot dogs, but my Southern taste buds are having none of it. I'm not saying that this wasn't a delicious hot dog, because it was exploding, both literally and figuratively, with flavor. My problem with a Chicago dog is that the toppings are so pervasive in flavors that I find that they overpower the taste of the frankfurter. Since I am not from Chicago, I don't have any frame of reference upon which to base a comparison of Matt's Chicago Dog, but I thought that it was the best example of a Chicago dog that I ever tried.   The Italian Beef was an entirely different animal.....  I ordered mine pretty much loaded to the gunwales. After reading the other Yelper's reviews, I went with grilled onions and both the hot and sweet peppers. And it's NOT an Italian beef unless it is dipped in the au jus.   When I received the sandwich, it was so large and unwieldy, I immediately gave up hope of picking up the sandwich and eating it that way. I had the foresight to grab a knife and fork, so I attacked it as an open face sandwich, and I'm glad that I did. One can take basic good bread and dip it into au jus, and the sandwich is darned good just like that. Add piles of tender, thinly sliced beef, jalapenos, sweet pickles and giardiniera, and one has a truly delicious sandwich.  The young lady who took my order jokingly said that I wouldn't be able to eat both sandwiches. She was wrong. The Chicago dog disappeared in four bites and the Italian beef followed soon thereafter. I washed everything down with a Barq's root beer which quenched the jalapeno flames well.  I enjoyed my initial visit to Matt's Chicago Dog very much, and I look forward to returning again. Memories of that delicious Italian beef sandwich linger."}
{"text":"As a refugee from Barry OwebaMao's nest, I miss nothing more than authentic Chi Town sourced ingredients and products like rabbi blessed kosher Vienna Beef hot dogs and Italian Beefs done roight.   If you miss that legit Taste of Chicago, or want to experience the best of both, get cho tookus to Matt's!  The dogs are brought to climax with steamed poppy seed buns and are indiscernible from that produced in the deep dark depths of Chiraq.    The beef is as good as it gets and comes with options such as regular (giardinara either unavailable or I missed it possibly), cheesy, giant or add Italian sausage or any possible matrix of these.   The place is an inside the South park home run!  It's worth mentioning that the parking cost me $9 and they won't validate it.  Makes for an expensive lunch if that's all you came for."}
{"text":"Made to order jalapeño poppers were amazing! Such a fun place to try as we were visiting charlotte for the day!"}
{"text":"Great Chicago dipped Italian Beef. Skin-on fries are spot on also. Can't wait to head back down & try their Chicago Dog."}
{"text":"My Hot Dog was good, but like many establishments these days the service was sub par. I walked up to the counter smiling ready to order, and the guy just stared at me like I was interrupting something that he had going on. I said Hi and he looked confused.....sooo before I placed my order I decided to give him some customer service 101......GREET!! I am amazed at the lack of individuals willing to at least do their jobs these days."}
{"text":"I love how places like this are giving us non beef, pork, and meat eaters the option to indulge in their savory selections!!! This is the perfect place for a quick lunch if you are in the mood for a hot dog. They also have other offerings, which I hear are amazing as well.   Yesterday I got the veggie dog Carolina style with the hand cut fries. When I first saw my basket I thought \"I see what that yelper meant by small portions\". However, it is a perfect portion and just right for a lunch. I left feeling like my hunger was appeased and not like I needed a nap.  For an American diet yes it is a \"small\" portion because it's not a heaping platter of food that you don't really need. I'm not saying the food is healthy because, well, fried potatoes lol. I am saying that for me a portion conscious eater it was just right!    The veggie dog was delicious! I almost thought it was beef for a second but it didn't have that nasty beefy bloody taste. The slaw was perfect, and the mustard and onion satisfied my Carolina craving. I really loved how the fries weren't salted. Maybe they just forgot, but I hate salty fries because I love ketchup and there's plenty of salt for me there.   I came around 11:30 which was a perfect time if you are like me and want to beat the lunch rush, which is a really big deal downtown with so many options to choose from and the pleasantries of the Overstreet Mall. Matts isn't located in the \"mall\", it is on The Green, which is not as crowded as other areas downtown (maybe because it's not in the center of the uptown area).   Amazing food, great location, great people and a park... what more do you need to get you through the day?! I will definitely be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chicago style pizza. Rivals Lou Malnati's in Chicago. Great quality pizza, dogs and with an OMB copper, you can't go wrong. Great surprise in NC!"}
{"text":"First time there today on national hot dog day. Really good dogs...we had a Chicago and a Carolina. Hand cut fries were hot, crispy and delicious. Can't wait to try the pizza."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of NY style dogs, but this wasn't bad. Good variety, good fries. Hubby really liked his dog. A solid three stars for food BUT an extra star for excellent customer service. They are wonderfully welcoming and treat kids like royalty."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch on a Saturday.  Was relatively crowded, but I was able to order quickly with my food coming out a few minutes later.    I ordered the Chicago Dog all the way and a brat.    The relish was bright green, so I was a little taken aback by it.  I gave it a shot, but it ultimately was not my taste, so it was banished to the serving container....  The remainder of the hot dog was really good though.   The brat - Nothing to write home about.  It was OK.  Not as good as a beer brat from home.  I would skip that one and just get 2 Chicago Dogs instead.  If you're looking for a hot dog in Chicago, Matt's is the place to get it!"}
{"text":"Sad Excuse for a hot dog.   If you're looking for mediocrity this is your place. Overall, do not order a hot dog.   I love a good chili dog. But this, unfortunately, could never amount to my expectations.   We were hoping they could muster up something at least edible.   Too much bread! Every bite was either only bread or more bread than dog. The cheese was just falling off the top, not melted in whatsoever. Cheap!   I asked to add some fresh jalapeno peppers. Instead of chopping and sprinkling within, like a normal cadet would do; they decided to throw in a few full peppers on the bun. What am I suppose to do with that? It's not to replace the dog, I'm not going bite into a bulb of a jalapeno pepper. It's to add some God damn flavor not overtake the whole meal. Fail.   Tasteless. I repeat. There was absolutely no flavor. That meat, the chili was bland substance added to a cheap hot dog.  Let's also say that one hot dog was $5, that in itself is way too high. I wouldn't buy another one of these, but if I mentioned it's true value, maybe $0.50 per, make it two for a buck, it's barely worth that, but absolutely not $5, much better options for something that actually has flavor elsewhere. Be warned.   Usually I like to say something nice about a place to offset the negatives, however, I regrettably can not say anything good about this place. Nothing to say about the staff, barely noticeable.  Note; This review is based on Hot Dog entirety. Not the other items on the menu which they might do better with."}
{"text":"Ah the windy city.  I don't miss the arctic temperatures in winter, I don't miss the insane sales taxes (higher than NYC), I don't miss the rampant corruption in government, I don't miss Mid-western indifference, what I do miss are Chicago hotdogs and I get them here...and they are always good.  Matt......keep it up!"}
{"text":"Great place. Very clean, nice people.  Hot dogs are great.  Haven't tried anything else yet but probably will."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Matt's Chicago Dog. I had the Cheesy Italian Beef Sandwich and it was fabulous!! My friend had the best Jumbo hot dog of his life. Highly recommendef!!!!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries were perfect! They were not soggy and they are cut into large chunks (like   Potato wedges. ) My mushroom and Swiss burger was also good. The bun  is toasted with butter and deserving of onions and tomato was a good amount. Usually when you request tomatoes and onions you have to search for them but these were falling out of the burger. Also to top it off the cashier found a tea bag for me !!! That is five star service in my book !!! Thank u"}
{"text":"This is my go-to lunch place. This is the best Italian beef in Charlotte. I always get the Italian sausage and cheese which is beef, a large sausage and cheese and I always get it dipped. The sides are great also including the house chips and the sweet potato fries. I have had many things on the menu and all are great! Highly recommended this place if your downtown for lunch."}
{"text":"Dogs tasted like rubber, we left without eating much of anything.  Brats were ok."}
{"text":"Another Yelp Bookmarked vist!!!! I FINALLY had a chance to Visit Matt's Chicago Dogs. My fiance and I Visited during Lunch hour.....no long wait, fast service.   I ordered the Matt's Chicago Dog Combo (w/ house fries), My fiance ordered the Bratwurst......which tasted horrible. My order was Perfection!!!! Also the weather was beautiful today. Unfortunately this location is closed on Saturday's.......boooo! I hear the Deepdish pizza is DeeeeeLish! Anywho, I look forward to another visit....maybe ill try the Italian Beef!!!"}
{"text":"First visit.  Had the jumbo char dog with slaw, grilled onions, and mustard.  Excellent.  The dog was very good.  The slaw was just right, but the onions were Luke warm.  Atmosphere is good with varied seating options and several tv's.  I'll definitely make another trip to this place."}
{"text":"Just went to Matt's and enjoyed their Carolina n Italian dogs!!!! Everything thing is freshly cut, prepared and cooked. If you love hot dogs, this is your place!"}
{"text":"It's not Portillo's, but it's a hell of a lot cheaper than the flight to Chicago!  I had to get the Italian Beef (wet, of course) and a Chicago style hot dog.  For fifteen bucks I was able to try this place out and left stuffed!  Five Stars!"}
{"text":"Chicago style hotdogs are not to be missed.  The Italian beef is alright, not the version I am used to from Buffalo.  I haven't tried the sausage or the pizza,, but I plan on doing that soon.  I am a toppings hog and they gave me plenty of toppings but not as much as I would have liked.  I wanted a mountain and they gave me a hill.  They also forgot my grilled onions.  My copilot had just grilled onions and she got tons of them.  The more different toppings you get the more scaled back they are.  Why four stars and not 3 or 5?  Food is really solid and reasonably fast.  Prices are reasonable.  Four stars is a high rating but this place doesn't rise to being even better than eating the same in Chicago.  Better fries than five guys played a part in the 4 over the 3.  The mix of flavors on the Italian beef didn't blow me away so I couldn't give a 5."}
{"text":"Burgers, hot dogs, pizza, salads & so much more.  This place offers so much variety in their menu, they are not just hotdogs.  Although, the Matt's Chicago Dog is a must & get their homemade chips with some ranch on the side...amazing!    Walk in & order at the counter then grab a seat and anticipate your yummy meal.  Nice decor with a mix of wood, brick & stainless steel.  They have a bar with beer on tap and wine.    It is definitely my go to spot when I want a corndog.  So yummy and hits the spot.  My inner 10 year old is forever happy.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for Chicago style pizza. UNOs closed down over 10 years ago and I missed going there. Unfortunately, we were struggling with Matt's. salt and pepper on the crust was odd, the bottom crust was soggy, the canned tomatoes on top were not fresh Roma's as noted in the menu - which left us with acidic tastes in our mouths. The meat, veggies and cheese were good, but overall pizza was not as good as we were hoping."}
{"text":"It's so cheap that it's hard to complain but I can't say this was a particularly good chicago dog. Still for 3 bucks it's a good snack/lunch and it's right next to where I work!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of items. They do have vegetarian alternatives. The restaurant sits back from the Main Street thus difficult to find."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the reuben and not the traditional food at Matt's (hot dogs). If you're looking to grab a hot dog, continue looking at the other reviews.  I continued my journey around Charlotte to find the best reuben with a stop at Matt's Chicago Dog. It seemed like an odd place to serve a reuben, but it was on the menu nonetheless. They should probably just stick with the traditional Chicago foods. The corned beef was rubbery, clearly boiled (and over-boiled at that), while the kraut was barely noticeable on the sandwich. The bread was barely crisped, which led to an unpleasant soggy bottom piece. The flavors were OK, but the sandwich itself left much to be desired. Certainly not the worst reuben around the Queen City, but not worth making a stop for."}
{"text":"So so good!! Been here a few dozen times and I still like it. Spent 40+ years in the NW suburbs and Matt's compares favorably with the upscale dog and burger places. First time in was dog and slaw: poppy seed bun, piccalill-ish, chopped onions, tomato wedges, sport peppers, mustard, and not enough celery salt to actually taste and a pickle you can't help but love! slaw would be better shredded than chopped but is quite good regardless. Question: Why is my hotdog in a foam coffin and not wrapped in paper?  Second time was beef and fries: best fries I've had in months! look good, feel good, smell good, taste good too. Got no beef with the beef: good strong flavor throughout that compliments the giardiniera, bitey french bread with firm crust and substantial innards that hold up well to a drowning. Really though, why the leaky foam box? -got gravy all over the passenger seat and the car smells like a beef sammich, on the plus side the car smells like a beef sammich ;-)  #3 -combo combo had one big delicious bite put it in fridge for after work and it got thieved #4 -polish (MS) and fries and chimps was spot on but I still prefer deep-fried if I can get it. #5,6 -free range \"Cubs Win!\" hot dog combos (wrapped in paper, not boxed) are so good.  ...burgers, reubens, beefs, dogs... and so it goes about once a week."}
{"text":"I'm a Carolina native, born and raised, but you can't get a better hot dog than a Chicago dog.    Matt's Chicago Dog is serving up authentic ingredient Chicago Dogs to the uptown area is mass quantity!  Quality is supreme and the taste does not disappoint!    The staff is friendly and professional and the establishment is always extremely clean, even during busy service.  it's somewhat of a hike for me to do for lunch (from far east Charlotte) but it's certainly worth the time!"}
{"text":"You know what it's like when you just don't know what to say?  This is one of those times.  You see, I'm often wondering if my mom is going to slap me for not saying anything nice and then bitch-slap me for never listening.  Or something.  I really wasn't paying attention.  Or maybe it is not that bad.  There are, after all, nice things to say about Matt's.  But there are spotty areas as well.  First the good...  The decor is marvelous (insert mid-80s Fernando accent via Billy Crystal here).  They have a decent number of seats, the outdoor seating is second-to-none - but you can bring your own lunch and get that, so it's not really specific to Matt's.  And the not-so-good...  The menu selection is immense.  So much so that you'll want to go when the place isn't crowded so that you have a reasonable chance of looking it over before ordering so as not to get in the way of anyone else.  That generally doesn't happen in most hot dog stands, either on the street or indoors because you have about two choices: All the way or plain, where you add your own condiments.  And the rest...  Though you can find Italian Beef and Chicago-style dogs in the same place, you don't always want to.  Focus on your specialty.  And that's the real problem here.  There is so much going on - visually and on the grill - that they don't seem to do anything really well.  Though the staff is nice enough, and food is decent, it's just not that great.  Fries are limp.  House-made chips are nice and thin, but they are so thin that they can't support anything (dressing, chili leavings from dogs, not even the crunch from the fryer).  Dogs are average.  I would much rather get a dog from Green's, or maybe Hap's, both of which have that awesome hot dog counter vibe and make me want more.  Matt?  Not so much."}
{"text":"I seriously crave their pizza puffs!!! They are the best thing ever. Filled with gooey cheese and pepperoni. I haven't tried anything else but if you ever get the chance to go, try the pizza puff!!"}
{"text":"Just saw the owner wiping down tables.  Met her and found out they've been here 14 years.    Fries are crisp and homemade, dogs extensively customizable and delicious."}
{"text":"I love Chicago hot dogs. I have loved them since I was a wee girl. Therefore, any place that makes a real deal, Vienna beef, loaded Chicago dog is aces in my book.   Is Matt's the best Chicago dog I've ever had? No. Is Matt's the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? Maybe. For those who are not up to speed on a traditional Chicago dog, it consists of: an all beef frank, onions, uber green relish, yellow mustard, sport peppers, tomato and a pickle spear hugged into a poppy seed bun. Matt's definitely delivers on these components. The dog was a bit snappy, like I enjoy, and all the condiments were fresh and tasty.   The Hot Dog Meal Deal (#1) came with the loaded Chicago dog, a drink and your choice of fries or chips for $6.22. I went with the fries and I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed...they were a little smushy. You can also read Tonya's most recent review on her description of the fries. Regardless though, I enjoyed my hot dog so much that I will overlook the limp fries.   I definitely want to come back and try a few other menu items...I see a cheesy beef in my future."}
{"text":"Good food. I wanted to try a \"hot dog\" place in NC because I grew up in NY and there was one on every corner. I had the Carolina dog. It was good, it had a nice snap to it when I bit into it. I like that because I prefer the natural casing dogs. I would like to try the deep dish pizza next time I go back."}
{"text":"The Chicago dog's are spot on!  Truly remind me of a Portillos dog.  The Italian beef however needs work.  The meat is sliced too thick to be authentic and the au jus tastes a bit too much like beef bullion.  All in all though, it's the best hot dog in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amazing hotdogs. Love the chili on the hamburgers or chili dogs. The deep dish pizza is pretty good. Cold beer clean place. Family friendly"}
{"text":"We stumbled across Matt's Chicago Dog while escaping the last winter storm. I'm a huge fan of Chicago-style hot dogs & Italian Beef and was beyond happy when we discovered Matt's had both and much more.  The hot dogs are excellent but I will have to wait to give another review after I try their version of a \"Carolina Dog.\" Love their fries. The kosher salt really adds a pop to them. I also didn't get a chance to try the Italian Beef and their Chicago-style Deep Dish Pizza. The have a BLT deep dish that I would love to try.  This is a hidden gym in the Cornelius area. You should stop by and try them if you're a fan of Chicago-style hot dogs and deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Chicago food...this is the place to go!!! Hot dogs are great! But the hamburgers might even be better!! Haven't tried the deep dish yet, cant wait to!"}
{"text":"I get cravings for brats and hot dogs every now and then and when I do I go here. My husband had never had Chicago style dogs before, weird, I know. When he told me that I made sure to take him here that night. He's become obsessed with them as much as I am."}
{"text":"Good Chicago dogs, fresh fries and good chlil on top!  Nice spot! Right on!  Plus price is right and good budget reliever! ;) quick service Apis friendly quick staff as well!  Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"i've been here a few times. I called my order in #5 (Cheesburger combo w/ fries). Once I walked in I stood in line waiting (while CHECKING IN to Yelp) to get to the counter to pick my order up.   Once the line dwindled down, i said i was here to pick up an order, She said my name (made me wonder if i was the only person to call a order in... DURING LUNCH).   Ok, you ordered a MUSHROOM SWISS BURGER (photo taken) w/ chips. Ummmm, NOoooo!! I ordered a number 5. Cheesebuger Combo w/ Fries & Drink  after a brief embarrasing moment. I was offered a \"Mushroom Swiss Burger\". Well I didn't order it 1st of all, But I LOVE FOOD, and havn't tried it before. So i say, \"sure\" why not (i didn't want them to throw it away either...no one wins in that case). So i asked for Fries (as originally ordered). I was given Fries and i was able to keep the CHIPS. (cool, i've never had them b4 either) chips are pretty good.  So, I get back to the office ready to tear into this burger. So... my first bite was filled with Mushrooms. Made me think, \"whoever ORDERED this must REALLLLY REALLLY REALLY LIKE MUSHROOMS... it was loaded w/ them and onions. bacon, & swiss.   Notta bad burger at all. I would probably get it again and ask for LIGHT MUSHROOMS.   *** also, once i got to the counter the young lady told me in a motherly fashion... THE NEXT TIME U CALL IN A ORDER.... DON'T WAIT IN LINE.. JUST COME RIGHT UP. with a big smile. (that was cool, considering while IN LINE on YELP i read that was the thing to do... smh.i gotta start reading faster.. it would have saved me 3-6mins)  Sooo all in all, even though i didn't get what i ordred, i was fine with the mistake made. I was more than happy with the way it was handled by the young lady.   Good Job, I will be back. (kinda pricey...combo #12 is a Two Dog Combo = 8.69 --- really????)"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have great hot dogs and awesome deep dish pizza. I try to stop by here whenever I'm around that area. The Matt's Chicago dog is my favorite."}
{"text":"Delicious. Double bacon cheeseburger was out of sight. Dining area is clean, homely, and neat. Service is super quick. The staff is SO helpful in making recommendations and making your order correctly. It's a fast service with a \"fast food\" feel, but the staff is involved and conversational. Towards the end of our meal, the owner came around and asked us what we thought. We told him we loved it, and we weren't lying!"}
{"text":"Ugh....for starters...the whole place smelled like formaldehyde.  Maybe I should've left A.S.A.P...but guess what?! I didn't.  I was in the area for an appointment and running short on time.  I order a personal pepperoni pizza at the suggestion of the cashier.     It looked really good when it came out.  It was not.  It tasted like a frozen pizza. And it also didn't taste cooked all of the way. Ugh again..can I just have a re-do?! I don't want any of it in my stomach right now. Help!!! The sauce had huge tomato chunks in it...but not good chunks..brown and green end pieces. Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  The crust was not crispy, but rather soft and mushy.  The only reason I gave two stars is because the cashier was friendly and though she steered me wrong, she seemed like a good person."}
{"text":"Great, great, great.  I am originally from Chicago, and this place could easily compete with the best hot dog and Italian beef stands in the city.  The menu is simple - hot dogs, hamburgers, and Italian beef.  The folks at Matt's use Vienna Beef products, just like you would find in Chicago.  The hot dogs are spot on.  They are true Chicago style hot dogs, and they are fantastic.  The Italian beef sandwiches - which can be ordered wet and/or with hot or sweet peppers - are amazing. And, in addition to the great sandwiches, the homemade chips are some of the best I have ever had.  The prices at Matt's are very reasonable.  If you order the special of the day or the hot dog combo, then you can easily get out of Matt's for under $7.  Not only is the food good, but the folks who run the place are really nice as well."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Matt's Chicago Dog. I didn't come for the hot dogs though... I came for the Chicago style deep dish pizza. I have heard about this place and have been planning the perfect time to pay a visit. Today was the day!   When we went to order, the cashier was awesome. She was kind, upbeat, and made some great selections. We started with the onion rings and ordered the deep dish meat lover's pizza.  The onion rings were some of the best I've ever had. No lie! They were perfect... not cooked too long, crispy, yet not too crispy. Perfection (great job). When the pizza arrived, it was beautiful. Upon taking my first bite, i wondered why in the world has it taken me so long to try this?? It tasted wonderful. The sauce had a blend of garlic and sweetness, the lean sausage was flavorful and added just the right touch to this pizza. The bacon and ham were excellent, as well.   All i know is, I hope to add this restaurant to my location and intend to visit soon."}
{"text":"Chicago is only minutes away from uptown Charlotte.  Didn't you know that?  Well, Matt's Chicago hot dogs were as close to authentic as you are going to get in North Carolina.    Chicago Dog Ingredients: Check  Restaurant Ambiance: Excellent (Check) Outdoor Seating in a Park: Check  Going back for many more hotdogs:  CHECK!!  They also offer combos so you can wash down the dog with some delicious fries and a soda.  There are several other options besides the Chicago dog if you are feeling adventurous.  They also offer burgers etc etc.  I haven't tried the burgers yet and it may be a while because I'm going to keep getting the dogs.  I love hot dogs.  Enjoy!!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"Matt's has the best hotdogs in town!  They have all different types of dogs along with a variety of toppings and sides.  Try the pizza puffs when you can too!  I always get a dog and some fries.  Hotdogs are served on a poppyseed bun, and the fries are the kind you get at your local burger joint.  Additionally, the staff are always very nice, friendly, and helpful.  I have not gotten any of the pizza, salad, or sandwiches yet, because I can't stay away from the hotdogs, but I have heard from friends that the pizzas are amazing too.  If you like a good hotdog, Matt's is your place!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this place is bad. My sausage was luke warm in the middle.  To me, the service and atmosphere were weird. I will not go back."}
{"text":"i love this place every time i'm here. the matt's supreme pizza is the shiggity!!!! but that mia v. has to be the rudest cashier/customer service /lady of the organization . she turns my stomach at the  lake norman exit!!! matt, if you can hear me !!!"}
{"text":"Ok for a quick hot dog.  Everything was good and the place was not to crowded"}
{"text":"A true jem if you are a fan of hot dogs, and you want something better than your ordinary ketchup and mustard dog.  I had the Chicago Dog, and it was great!!  They offer a choice of sides, and i had the sweet potato fries.   They have a very extensive menu, including chicken, salads, pizza, and burgers... in case the dogs aren't what you want that day.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in Chicago so I am happy to find a place that serves Vienna dogs and also has Italian Beef the Chicago way.  The dogs were awesome and the beef was really good except I don't like Vienna's giardiniera relish....I prefer Marconis!  If Matt's used Marconi's relish instead and was able to get the Turano bread delivered fresh, it would be a miracle!  THE FRESH CUT FRIES ARE THE BEST WAY TO EAT FRIES!  This is how we eat them in Chicago and if you don't like them this way, then get the o-rings.  :)"}
{"text":"I finally made a stop here for the first time. I'm honestly not a hot dog person, but was impressed after our first visit here. The staffs greeted me right away. They were very friendly, fast-service, and attention. A+ for the first impression!  The restaurant has a variety menu options, from salads, hot dogs, sandwiches, pizzas, to deep dish pizzas. It's very clean inside. The decor is just like other hot dogs/burgers places, nothing special. There is a bar section with beer on tap and a lot of drinks that you can relax. They have a lot of seats, though. I noticed that a lot of people do take-out orders.   The concept is, you order and pay for it. Then go to the other side to pick up your drinks and meals. I would say that they have the best sweet potato fries hands down. Four stars for the portion, though. Their hot dogs are pretty small compared to the price. Anyways, the food itself was very tasty and worth the stop.  I will keep going back."}
{"text":"I love love love crossing off bookmarks and there's nothing quite like deleting one from nearly a year and a half ago. Yes, it's April 2012 and Yelp tells me that I've had Matt's bookmarked since December 2010 after reading Cassandra's ROTD. http://www.yelp.com/biz/matts-chicago-dog-charlotte#hrid:Kn7dQhdcPMfAv-UTRkQjxA. And so with my hot dog craving unsatisfied from several attempts, here I am.  Popped in towards the end of the lunch hour and was able to find a seat to drop off my backpack. At the register, I went with the eponymous Chicago Dog of course. But I knew that one hot dog wouldn't fill me up, so I had a Carolina Dog to go with it. And a Diet Coke, to cancel out all those bad calories.  The Chicago Dog was made almost perfectly traditionally. An all-beef hot dog on a poppy seed bun, topped with sport peppers (a little too hot for my taste, I took one bite and had to put them to the side), tomato wedges, chopped onions, yellow mustard, celery salt and that green relish that practically glowed in the dark. The only ding is that the pickle was a slice (lengthwise) rather than a spear. It doesn't matter to me personally, but a Chicago Dog connoisseur might be upset. Whatever, it tasted AWESOME.  The Carolina Dog was ON THE MONEY. Also an all-beef hot dog, it was topped chili, mustard, chopped onion, and cole slaw. Messy as all get out, but I was prepared and didn't wear any of it home.  After seeing the mentions of the fries, I skipped 'em. Free refills on the soda. If it's a nice day (and it was!) take it outside.  Oh, and that pesky craving for hot dogs? Totally slayed."}
{"text":"Good food . Good price friendly staff. Clean bathrooms.  I have a hot dog place 3 miles from me. I drive from Mooresville down to Cornelius.  Just to eat here."}
{"text":"I thought I was just getting a hot dog - something quick to satisfy my hunger on a cold day after the parade.  I did not go all the way with a Chicago-style dog and had only ketchup and pickles.  I have to say, halfway through, I was enjoying this hot dog.  Now that I am recalling the experience, I am looking forward to another visit when I am Uptown.  The fries (my daughter's) were not to my liking but the tea was acceptable.  The restaurant is small so stopping in before or after the lunch hour is probably a good idea if you want to get a seat.  However, on a warm and sunny day, you can sit somewhere outside in The Green."}
{"text":"As always. The best and only place to get a great taste of Chicago!! Get the beef and sausage combo. So worth it"}
{"text":"Matt's Chi-Town Dogs have the best dogs this side of the far south side of Chi-Town. Just so you all know they also have the true combo, Nice Scalas Beef with a Vienna Italian Sausage with peppers with a peppery aujus. I do recommend the far north Matt's in Cornelius. It is small, but that reminds me of the small hot dog joints of Chicago and the outlining suburbs. For those of you that are from the windy city and miss the good not-so-fast foods from home, this is the place!!         Now if to find a Deep Dish place here that matches Lou's or Connie's then I will be set."}
{"text":"First off, I am from the Chicago area. I love me some Chicago style hot dogs. I don't miss a visit to Portillo's when I am up there. Actually, I usually eat it daily when visiting. This place would be very mediocre in Chicago. They have Vienna beef which is nice but it's not the same taste as the solid Vienna Beef hot dog joints in Chicago. They also sliced my spear pickle into a small section which is super cheap.  Never see that in Chicago. The other toppings were good. I don't expect a Portillo's or Gene and Jude's quality in Charlotte but I think this could be better. The staff is somewhat friendly and overall it's better than any thing else you will find around Charlotte so I will give it three stars. That splitting the spare pickle just rubs me the wrong way. How much does a pickle really cost? I paid $7.49 for a dog, drink and fries so really?"}
{"text":"I love a good dog.  Matt's Chicago dogs always look and taste very fresh. They have a broad variety of sandwiches, burgers, etc. but I only go for the hot dogs. Pleasant setting by an artsy greenbelt/park tucked between bldgs in Uptown. I make a point to have lunch there on my fairly frequent visits to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Had my first Chicago-style hotdog ever here a few months ago. Unique and very delicious! Though as a NC boy, the chili-slaw dog is still my go-to. You can get those here as well, but I've yet to try them. Had a Chicago dog all-the-way with sweet potato fries last night. Great taste combination and wonderful change of pace from run-of-the-mill hotdog and fries. A unique place in the South for sure. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"With a ton of lunch options in the Uptown area, Matt's Chicago Dog is definitely one of my lunch \"go-to\" options.  It's located off of the Green which is great if you are sitting in a cubicle all day and need some vitamin D.  They keep it pretty simple... dogs and burgers/sandwiches.  The menu can be a bit overwhelming with options, but I haven't had a bad sandwich or item here.  You come in, fall into line, place your order, and wait for your delicious food to be brought to the table (dining in) or your number to be called out (take out).  The dining space is small and cramp (like everything else in uptown) but they make the most out of the space with plenty of tables, sometimes it's hard to procure a table yourself, but the turn around is quick and you also have the option of taking the food outside on the Green.  Pretty interesting mural painted on the wall to make it look like you aren't inside, but outside on the street - props to the artist that can paint glass reflections on the store windows.  OK... I haven't had a chicago dog here (gasp!) but all the rest of the food I have had here has been very solid so I am sure their Chicago dogs are great.  It's not Chicago, but it can definitely hold it's own."}

{"text":"Being from Chicago I wasn't expecting much, BUT as soon as I saw the Vienna Beef signs in the window, I knew it was going to be good! They do the Chicago dog 100% Chicago style, right down to the poppy seed bun and bright green sweet relish. The beef it awesome as well. Topped with the real giardiniera, aka hot peppers! If your feeling Chi-town enough, get it dipped!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, best hotdogs I've had in a long time. The Carolina dog is great, fries are good, fresh cut and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"With the combo of quality of food and prices, I am between 3 and 4 stars here with the 4 for the food and the 3 for the price you pay for it.  Will give the benefit of the doubt toward the food for this review however.  Agree with the commentary on the hot dogs.  Good quality VIenna Beef dogs which they charbroil for you when you order a \"Char-dog\".  The hamburgers are kind of thin but the meat is good and charred and the buns are of the nice soft, sesame seed variety.  The choices of starch are both quite good, the house made chips and the fresh cut fries.  I love dipping the chips in some of their blue cheese dressing.  You know the healthy way to eat chips...  The fries are best (like any fries) when they are cooked to order but this isn't always the case and when it's not there is a little sog factor going on.  For their other big claim to Chicago fame, the Italian Beef sandwich, I've found it to be hit or miss.  Sometimes the meat is a bit dry and tough and that is the exact opposite of what one expects from a real deal Italian Beef.  When it's good though, it is pretty darn close to authentic with delicious spicy, juices that it is (or should be) dipped in.  On the service side, I've never experienced anything but friendly and efficient so, high marks there."}
{"text":"I like Matt's because they make most everything right to order so the burgers, fries, etc are always piping hot and fresh.  It takes a bit longer than not doing this way but the trade off is well worth it.  Love the Italian Beef, Char Dog and Fire Dog as well.  This location is really convenient to my office so I find myself there at least a couple times a month and will continue doing so as long as they remain consistent in what they do."}
{"text":"Grestest food in the entire world.  Italian beef.  Chicago dogs with sport pepper and bright green relish.  Cubs on the TV."}
{"text":"Stopped into Matt's yesterday around 11:55 before the noon lunch rush.  The place definitely got packed around 12:05.  It's in a strip with many good looking lunch places but I was craving a hot dog.  I ordered the carolina dog combo.  Seemed like a reasonable price for an uptown lunch stop.  The food was ready pretty quickly.  The dog was a big ole mess; understanding that \"big\" and \"mess\" are good things.  I really liked the slaw and the chili had good flavor.  You got the mustard flavor in there too while still being able to taste the actual dog.  Nice blend.  The poppy seed bun was different but good.  Though, I was always prefer a toasted bun.  Staff was really friendly and drove this review to 4 stars."}
