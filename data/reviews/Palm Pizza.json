{"text":"Awesome pizza, great prices!  Always fresh... if you're feeling really brave, ask for the Mexican Pizza. Freaking awesome..."}
{"text":"Yooooo!! This place SUCKS!!! I just ordered from there. They got to my house pretty quick, but the food is horrible. I mean its really bad. I dont know who's cooking the food, but they need to fire that dude! But whatever i aint going there again."}
{"text":"Another good day at Palm PIzza. Cant say this one was the best in my wings experience but they were nice and juicy and good. Nice and spicy like I like them just EXTRA SMALL. I wouldnt mind paying 2 bucks more, for Wings with more meat on them. Other than that, they were great! Nice and hot! Customer Service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Chicken Caesar salad is actually a house salad with a side of Caesar dressing. There are more onions & tomatoes than there is lettuce. Also, paying $1.00 extra to add chicken only to not get chicken on my onion & tomato salad. Disappointed to say the least.
Bacon CHEESEburger has NO CHEESE. It had 1 measly slice of sad bacon. Disappointment #2.
Philly cheese steak....I ordered with mayo & green peppers, no onions. It was just plain with cheese. The steak was so bland & definitely wasn't seasoned at all. 3 strikes, they're out!!
The only thing that they got right were the 2 cans of Coke. Even though they were warm. No condiments like I asked for. Not even any napkins. I made sure to specifically ask for some also. 
I ordered through the Eat24 app.
I will NEVER order from this place again! I suggest you don't either!"}
{"text":"good service. great food. great prices.. alot of crackheads standing  outside.. they have good specials. but if ur looking for something fast and good i would recommend"}
{"text":"Not happy with the pizza, very poorly made and tastes bland. It's unfortunate because they are so close to my work. Wish it was better."}
{"text":"I ordered something different this time.. Giving this place its last chance with me.. It's over guys.. Pizza is horrible. Ravioli is horrible. Cakes are horrible.. Omg the baklava ... I've never tasted it ruined this way, it tastes like it's made with soap. The only thing half decent was the fish(not the catfish) and i should have ordered it this time but hey....  I ordered the carrot cake as well.. It's not as hard as last time but now i remember why i hated it.. The icing is super weird And has a flavor that makes me wanna chunk it in the trash.. That's exactly what I'm doing.. Thnx guys for the waste of money. Never again"}
{"text":"Great deals and okay pizza also got my order wrong when they came by I didn't mind that much also didn't get chocolate cake and one of the pizzas did not have cheese on tomato sauce and meatballs"}
{"text":"I came back just to see if the wings were as good as they use to (even though i will never order there crappy pizza ever again) because the wings are the only thing they have going for them ...they were pretty good,  I got them well done , I like that they ask how you want them. the fries were decent and the ranch was ok . although  this place or any place will never compare to Albos."}
{"text":"Went to get some pizza from this place. The place is pretty small but, the food is a really good price for the amount. They have a super large pizza for about $22 that could easily feed 10 people. We ordered chicken fingers,fries and 2 pizzas. The chicken wings and French fries were delicious. The pizza is just mediocre. I would recommend this place for anyone on a budget trying to feed a large group."}
{"text":"Good hand-tossed pizza. They have a couple of tables but are more of a delivery or take-out place. Good value, and even more affordable if you take advantage of their specials or coupons."}
{"text":"If you could have negative stars for a review, I would leap for the opportunity. Not only does the pizza taste like an easy bake oven recipe, but their customer service was less than satisfying! i would rather get a cheese pizza from Chuck E. Cheese, pay less money and still go for a second slice, and i can't stand Chuck E. Cheese. We ordered for delivery and it was a quick time, I mean, they're only down the street, but when i sunk my teeth in i wasn't pleased. I called them back, to try and get a refund, but the guy said, \" It's just pizza, what do you expect?\" what kind of customer service is that? If you live on the east side of Charleston, go to Pop-Up-pizza (707-366-0049.) In no way is this some kind of advertisement for Pop-Up, but since we live on E. Charleston, there are few places that will deliver ANYTHING over here. Its way better than anyone would expect,gourmet style pizza and a great price. Palm Pizza not only had poor quality food, but un-respectable customer service as well."}
{"text":"Wow!!! is all I can say, since they have NEW management this place has been great. There is some pretty bad reviews on this place, I do have to agree with the customer service part. The owner is great and very friendly as well as  the guy in the back. But the girl who packs the food in the back has an awful attitude. All in all great pizza and wings, the cheese is delicious as well as the crust (nice and crisp semolina bottom). Only bad thing is all the homeless people that hang around there."}
{"text":"Pizza was all bread they skimped on cheese, sauce and toppings, crust was good though"}
{"text":"Best family owned pizza joint on the east side! The crust is flavored with the perfect seasoning. 

We go here for lunch often. The pricing is reasonable. It's cheaper than the other franchised pizza places. We always get the pepperoni, jalape√±o, and pineapple pizza."}
{"text":"Negative:

-took a while to get food and as far as I'm concerned it wasn't busy. Didn't see a delivery car go out once and saw about 2 customers come in.(about 45 mins)
-not the most clean place


Positive:

-many options. Pizza, fried chicken, chicken wings, burgers, gyro, burrito, quesadilla, sub sandwich, salads, many pasta meals, dessert.
-decent price

Food:

-pesto pizza 
       -pretty good. A little too much cheese for my liking but I know other people love cheese. Tomato pieces were ridiculously huge so I took them off. Overall it was a pretty good pizza

-gyro
       -it was really good. Besides the ridiculously big pieces of tomato that I took off again. 

Overall it satisfied what I was looking for. The negative parts were expected from a small place lil"}
{"text":"If I could give it less than one star I would. I can't speak to the quality of the food because I never received it. After ordering online and waiting over an hour for the food I called the restaurant. I was informed by a very inexperienced person that \"we have the food. It's cooked. It's just gonna be another 30 minutes for delivery.\" To which I said \"wait, you cooked my food and now it's just gonna sit there for 30 minutes getting cold and you want me to pay full price for this?\" She then said the manager was out making a delivery and she couldn't offer me a discount and kept asking if I wanted to cancel. I get that places get busy. I do. But that's not my problem. And when you screw up, make it right. Terrible customer service and it's a shame because they're a local place and I prefer supporting local businesses. 

So update!!!!
The manager called me back, listened to me explain and says \"so how can I help you?\" Not in a nice way like let me take care of you but in a \"what do you want me to do about it sort of way.\" And I said \"well I'm not paying for cold pizza\" and he hangs up. I call back and say \"did you just hang up on me?\" To which he replies \"yes!\" And hangs up again. 

I call back again and get into a pointless argument here he says had I just asked nicely he would have given me a free pizza but instead said \"go to McDonald's!\" The man is foreign so whatever country he immigrated from I'm sure treats people like this but not in America! Do not order from this \"family run business.\" You are better off going to McDonalds!!! Thank god I didn't pay with a card."}
{"text":"Do NOT order from Palm Pizza.

I ordered lunch through Eat24 with Palm Pizza and was quoted 45-60 minutes. After 75 minutes Eat24 called the restaurant and they were told that the driver had ALREADY LEFT and was en route to my office. 45 minutes later I had still not received the food so I reached out to Eat24 and they contacted Palm Pizza. They were informed that the restaurant had lost my order... TWICE and that they could have it to me in another 45-60 minutes!

Needless to say I declined their offer, Eat24 issued a full refund and and encouraged Eat24 to cancel their contract with Palm Pizza since their customer service is so grossly substandard.

Ridiculous..."}
{"text":"Good pizza for the price. I've returned a few times now, they have been very consistent. This is one of the few places where I actually eat the crust. Don't expect a gourmet pizza experience, expect a well made above average pizza experience. I got a 12\" pizza and a 2 liter for under $20 including tip. Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Great food!! Always come here for my chicken wings ! Always good! GREAT pizza too love this place!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place, but now they just don't care. Most of the time my phone order was incorrect and when I called to let them know, I was told that is what I ordered. Huh?!? I now what I ordered and what I like. I always order the exact same thing everywhere."}
{"text":"The crust was very hard.  The food was ok.  Besides the pizza, everything else was out of a box.  Not the best at all."}
{"text":"Pizza was below average, cheese tastes cheap, the bread was burnt. Such low quality ingredients. Waiting over an hour and 15 minutes for the pizza was bad enough. Don't order from here take my word for it and save your time. Waste a few more bucks and get yourself a better pizza at a good pizza place."}
{"text":"I'll start of and tell you what was good about my order. The single order of potato wedges comes with a LOT of wedges. From there is was down hill. I made my order at 4:32 pm. My order did not arrive until 5:55 pm.  All the food was cold. The potato wedges were cold and soggy. Our Philly cheese steaks were cold and appeared to be made with gyro meat. The breaded shrimp bites were cold and soggy from the sauce that was spilled all over.  The chicken nuggets were cold.   

By cold I do not mean uncooked.  Just that our food was probably hot or warm at one point, but the hour and a half it took for delivery made the food cold.

It will be difficult to give a reason why I would ever order from here again."}
{"text":"it was alright . pepperoni pizza was kind of flat. marinara sauce was too sweet. soggy at the bottom . great wings though."}
{"text":"So, I just ordered and got my 
10 onion rings 3.99
5 mozzarella sticks 3.99
10 chicken fingers with fries 14.99
and strawberry cheesecake 2.95

All in all, I'd have to say that everything was alright.
Like, it wasn't terrible...it was edible and tasted okay. Honestly, everything tasted exactly how much it costs. 
Don't order the cheap food they have and expect it to taste as good as other places. The prices are the best thing about this place, besides the customer service. They do have decent customer service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were visiting Vegas and we drove past this joint. We decided to stop and check it out. I asked the guy to give me the best thing on the menu and he made a Philly Cheesesteak 14\" pizza for us. I wasn't expecting much because the place is a little ghetto and run down but it was really good. My girlfriend thinks the same. Good stuff."}
{"text":"We've been coming here a lot more lately and getting a bigger variety of food. We haven't been disappointed yet. The staff is always friendly and the food is so so so good."}
{"text":"The worst service ever! My family and i have been going here since 2009 and we have only ordered chicken fingers from them so the only thing i can say about the food is the fingers are good but customer service is horrible they forgot an order of fries for the 3rd time that we have ordered and this time the person we spoke to told us if we don't like having bad customer service to just not call them again. Really? Is that how you treat customers palm pizza? I'm rating you a zero and from now on I'll take my business else where to a better place with employees who care about their customers."}
{"text":"I wish my experiences with this restaurant were like the other reviewers. I had my food delivered. I had a small peporoni pizza and a philly combo sandwich. Since my order was over $15 I received a complimentary slice of cake (I picked lemon). I couldn't get past a couple of bites of the sandwich or the pizza!!!. If you like salt then you can't go wrong with this place!! If you can imagine eating a salt sandwich or a salt slice of pizza you have experienced what I experienced when I ate the food from here!! I will give them a \"decent\" (meaning digestible) rating on the fries and cake, otherwise this place gets a thumbs down with Shaquille Oneal's hands!!!...lol..Horrfible!!!...However, the delivery was fast!!!. But even that was flawed as he didn't have his charge card machine and I had to call in my credit card info outside of my apt bldg. for all the world to hear!!!...lol..Thank God my credit limit is extraordinarily low on the card I used, or I would have had to worry about I.d. scammers besides an upset stomach with what little I did \"manage\" to swalow!! ...lol..proceed at your own risk!!!...lol"}
{"text":"I will never again order from these people again I always order never had problems  n they claim I wasn't home n they called me for deliver  lies.  They been delivering colled food n the do called manger  wS a true ass in the phone  bad business bad service  bye"}
{"text":"I went to Palms pizza and the pizza was good.  I was surprised it was so good cause i read a couple of the reviews prior. I came to find out that they have new ownership and they actually changed the recipe to make the pizzas better."}
{"text":"This pizza spot is located in a shady strip mall on East Charleston. Now, you may want to reconsider actually going into this place, but my husband and I did on a Saturday afternoon as we were headed home from shopping.

Me: \"Look, that kid has a pizza. Pizza sounds good.\" (Kid was walking down the street with a pizza box)
Husband: \"I bet he got it from that pizza place right there.\"
Me: \"You want to get pizza? I'm hungry.\"
Husband: \"Okay.\" (Pulls into shady strip mall)

WELL, basically that's how it went. We entered this tiny storefront, which has two small tables, and a tiny bar area. This place is obviously mainly for pick-up or delivery. 

We ordered a medium one-topping ($5.99). They charge a .50 cent fee for running a debit or credit card by the way.

As for the pizza - it reminded me of Chuck E Cheese pizza. They use the really stringy cheese, so when you pull away from the pizza you get that seriously cartoonish looking style of eating pizza a la Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The sauce is obviously from some cans and I can guarantee you none of this stuff is fresh. But for $5.99 what do you expect? 

It's OK. Would I go out of my way to eat here again? No. But was it good for an unexpected splurge? Yes."}
{"text":"Palm Pizza is an honest family ran business, down to earth Oooo so tasty. As the former owner of \"Kap's Pizza Roma\" in Lancaster, CA I know a little about pizza. Now that I reside here in Las Vegas, Palm Pizza is the only place I bring home for my family."}
{"text":"pizza was ok...when I ordered I was told there was a $3 delivery fee.  later on I got a call saying they had to charge me $5 more for delivery, with no explanation.  $8 delivery fee???  I don't think so!  Be careful when ordering here."}
{"text":"Dear YELP please hurry up and make ZERO stars be an option.

If you like cardboard drizzled in cheap sauce, cheap cheese (generic brand tasting), and burnt TINY pepperonis. You have found the right place. I hate to say but this pizza is nasty there is no pride in their pizza making at all.

Second your drivers RUDE the driver insulted my friend by asking if she was a man. WTF what employee does that? It goes to show there professionalism and work ethic is just as good as their pizza. 

So moral of the story if you like week old fresh out the freezer box tasting pizza with a side of disrespect from a minimum wage driver you are in the right place.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Delicious! Most times we order one of the pizza & wings specials, but tonight we went all in for their burgers. OMG so good -but, lord Jesus, they are HUGE. We tried one each of a Double Bacon and a Palm Burger w/bacon. Tastes homemade not frozen and the Palm burger had lots of real, fresh avocado slices & yummy mushrooms. Fries aren't great, but onion rings are! The fried ravioli is good too. Calzone is one of the best I've ever had. The ranch dip you can get on the side is really good. 
Their pizza is really good re-baked the next day when you have leftovers (actual baked not microwaved!).  
If you order delivery on a weekend, expect to wait an hour to an hour&half. If you go to the actual joint, be warned it is a dive, but in one of those locals-only-best-food- ever kind of ways."}
{"text":"Stopped to get a salad on the way home from work.  Ordered an antipasto salad. Everything was fresh and the lettuce crispy. I would have preferred less lettuce and more of the meats and cheese. Overall, satisfied and will return when in the area."}
{"text":"Pizza was ice cold. The driver had the wrong address. I checked the confirmation email and I entered it correctly. So it wasn't my fault. When the driver finally got to the hotel he couldn't find the parking lot so I had to come downstairs to get it. I passed a pizza hut driver on my way to the room so if you want a got pizza delivered to your room I'd call pizza hut or someone else"}
{"text":"This is an awesome pizza place delivery driver was great!!!! Our new pizza place!!!!!! We had a choice of sauce which you don't get from other pizza places Thanks for a great dinner continually do a wonderful job. Thanks so much keep up the good work!!!!!!"}
