{"text":"Honestly I'm not impressed. And this is hard to say because I was so excited to try MACS! I couldn't finish my lunch, there was just nothing good about the quality or taste of the product. I definitely prefer noodles and company over MACS."}
{"text":"Thought we would try something different for lunch the other day so we stopped at Macs and glad we did. I thought it would be like Noodles but it was different because all the entrees come in little skillets with little pieces of bread. All the entrees are under $10 which is nice. I had the Chicken bacon ranch mac and it was very good. I will definitely go again and want to try the melts next."}
{"text":"We need a MACS in the northwest suburbs of Chicago!!!  How about Hoffman Estates?  Love the Mac and cheese variety there and we've driven out of our way to go there!"}
{"text":"We came at 830 and the doors were locked. workers standing there doing nothing. Don't advertise being open until 9 if you're not really open."}
{"text":"Fast comfort food. I did not know that there are so many ways to make macaroni and cheese but this place has a delightful menu of palate pleasing variations. Service is always friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Love macs. The mac n cheese is always good. Service is fast. Prices are economical. 

Sometimes I think I'm picky. Then I come read Yelp reviews. Holy cow. You'd think people think they are dining at 5 star, $300 a plate restaurants. #YoureNot"}
{"text":"Wow this place is good!!! I have not found a dish I didn't like. First time I was really hungry and ordered the largest size. I could only finish half, but my teenager downed the whole thing in one sitting. I'll probably get the medium next time. The large is bigger than it looks. But sooooo good."}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken was excellent!  Taco was great and the kids had the mammas. Outside seating was perfect on such a nice day."}
{"text":"Mac N Cheese made creatively. There was something for everyone in our family and different sizes to match our appetites. Would love to see organic, local, non GMO & non CAFO featured macs!!!!"}
{"text":"The service and food was delicious. It is great to have such a great restaurant in Sun Prairie and this definitely is the place to be. I had the Mac and cheese and a grilled cheese chicken sandwich with bacon. The chips complimented the dish along with the pickles. I recommend this place highly and will be attending again."}
{"text":"OMG! I wish they had one of these were her I loved her, but it seems to be a purely Wisconsin franchise. Macaroni and cheese sounds rather boring, but here it is served in a small cast-iron skillet combined with any of a dozen different add-ins. I got the jalapeño popper version, and I only regret the number of calories. The next time that I'm in town, I will be sure to stop here again."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes because who doesn't like mac and cheese? The two bread slices they give were not good. My pieces were black and overly salty, I don't know if the bread was intended to be salted but it was almost bitter from so much salt. The topping I had was the Philly cheesesteak and that was really good until you got to the pasta. The macaroni was average nothing to rave about which I would think would be the best part considering the name. Also disappointed to pay 10$ for the dish. Maybe I just had too high of expectations."}
{"text":"Mac's is crave-able!  I had Jalapeño Popper  Mac and it was awesome!  Maybe it's my inner fat guy talking but, the regular portion seemed small so opt for the Mac Daddy and if anything take the rest home.  

For fast-casual, the dinning area was welcoming and well kept.  They also serve  beer- the perfect companion for your Wisconsin diet."}
{"text":"I love mac and cheese and every dish I have had there has been delish. I always get the biggest size because their leftovers are just as good"}
{"text":"We tried Mac's for the first time tonight for dinner. The decor is nice, modern/rustic. There was outdoor seating, but we chose to sit inside. Similar to Noodles, but all of the dishes are based on macaroni and cheese. There are 2 sizes: regular ($5.25-6.95) and Mac Daddy ($7.25-9.95). They also have melt sandwiches served with chips and a pickle ($5.50-8.25). There were a few wedge salad options ($6.25-6.95) and desserts (cookies, cheesecake, chocolate cake). I accidentally ordered the wrong dish. I ordered by the wrong number. When the food came out, I realized my error. I felt terrible and apologized to the server. She was very nice and assured me it was no trouble to make the dish I originally wanted. They made my dish quickly and the kitchen staff ran it out to our table right away. The food is delicious. I had the Popeye Mac and my boyfriend had the Chicken Bacon Ranch Mac. They were served in iron skillets. Hearty and flavorful. Definitely come to this restaurant on your cheat day! The chocolate cake was wonderful. The Mac Daddy size is generous. We ate half of our meals and brought the other halves home. If you are a big eater, you may end up eating the whole meal. We will come here again."}
{"text":"We went with some non-cheese eating kids. It took a few minutes to figure out but learned we could order them a side of hotdogs along with the adult meals. They did not have the pb&j as indicated on the Yelp listing. Obviously not health food, but still a fun place to stop on our way through town. The jalapeño mac was spicy. The Memphis was a hit with our crowd. The taco was bland, and I'm told the baked potato was super yummy. The small size was enough for us. Anyone who ordered larger left with a leftover container."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the Buffalo Chicken Mac and it was fantastic. The iron skillet keeps the food hot. And the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Mac's had a 5 star review from me, but they changed the tried and true \"Huy Fong Foods\" brand sriracha hot sauce to \"Roland's\" brand sriracha hot sauce which is literally inedible. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick food! My mouth is watering just thinking about the cheesy goodness that MACS offers. The flavor combinations are awesome. I'll be back the next time I'm in town to try out something new on the menu!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time tonight. For some reason, we thought it would be similar to Noodles & Company. Our food was okay but it seemed overpriced for the portion size. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Went Saturday night with wife and daughter. They were busy. Daughter had the regular mac and cheese, wife had the chicken bacon ranch(mac daddy) and I had the Philly steak(mac daddy). Food came out in about 15 minutes so not too bad for being busy. All three dishes were good and liked. Chicken bacon ranch was the best of the bunch. Get's a little pricey, but with the price of cheese and ingredients nowadays, i can understand somewhat. And you do not have to tip. Fairly nice layout, but was very cold temperature wise when we were there. Probably will be a once every 6 weeks or so type of place in our out to eat budget."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and different than the every day normal chains. Employees are friendly and always helpful with any questions. I wish there were a couple more locations closer to our house but when we travel....its worth the extra stop."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Macs but unfortunately, the food didn't really do much for me. I ordered the Jalapeno Popper Mac and Cheese and the Taco Wedge salad as a to-go order. The Wedge salad was pretty basic with iceberg lettuce, a few sliced tomatoes, shredded cheese, and ground beef. There wasn't anything extraordinary about the ground beef flavoring and they forgot to include the side of sour cream. 

The Jalapeno Popper Mac and Cheese had okay flavor from the peppers but was fairly lack-lusterous otherwise. I realize that Mac and Cheese should be cheesy, but this was entirely too heavy on the different cheeses for my liking. At one point, I got an entire spoon full of cream cheese... The description of the dish didn't provide the noodle type but I believe they were rigatoni noodles which aren't my favorite for mac and cheese either.

As far as pricing goes, they are overpriced for \"Fast-Casual\" dining. The \"Daddy Mac\" is the largest size and is still smaller than the \"Regular\" size at Noodles. The \"Daddy Mac\" cost was $8.25 compared to $5.59 at Noodles. My total order was around $17.00 including a drink which seems pricey for a bowl of pasta and an iceberg salad.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice with both indoor and outdoor seating. The staff was courteous, my food was promptly prepared and they seem to have a variety of food selections. I may consider giving one of the other dishes a try, but for the money and taste, I'm still a loyal Noodles and Company customer."}
{"text":"Brought the kids who are mac n cheese efficientatos, they gave it 3 stars.  We all agreed the noodles were overcooked.  Boo!  I also give it 3 stars for my salad, as it was small and average.  I really liked the atmosphere, our warm greeting and the service was very friendly and genuine."}
{"text":"Jalapeno Popper is the only thing I know now. Amazing!"}
{"text":"We first experienced MACS in The Dells and we're just enamored by it! So delicious! Then we realized we had one near our home! That was a big mistake, because now we are regulars!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It gets super packed here! I really like their Buffalo Chicken Mac! That was awesome. Not a big fan of the Hangover Mac... it was really just eating a lot of grease which I'm not much of a fan of. Anyway, that one was not for me. The kids enjoyed the regular mac. They were not into experimenting but they all loved the Buffalo Chicken Mac! I would definitely go there again! It was quite expensive... so... pay attention if you're going in there with kids! The regular portions weren't that big but it fills you up! The place was pretty cramped and there was not a ton of places to sit. So if you don't want to wait, go during their down time... maybe avoid lunch and dinner hours. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"I WANT ONE OF THESE IN MY HOMETOWN!

I have now visited three different locations of MACS and find the food, decor and service to be very consistent.  

I have tried a few of the different mac and cheese options but I think that on this most recent visit that I have settled on the Memphis mac as my favorite!  I had never had it before because I wasn't sure about the BBQ sauce on the mac and cheese.  Well, boy was I wrong!  The combo of the pulled pork, fried onions and BBQ sauce on the mac and cheese was a flavor bomb in my mouth!

They offer three sizes of their delectable concoctions.  I get the medium size which is plenty large.  Hubby's eyes were bigger than his stomach on this visit and he got the largest size - too much!  The mac and cheese with the grilled hot dogs was too much for him.

This visit was an early lunch - around 11am.  The place was already pretty full.  We were able to get a table (not right next to) with a view to a window so that we could keep an eye on the dog who was waiting for us, not so patiently, in the car."}
{"text":"We were just traveling through Madison on our way to OshKosh and discovered this place during a coffee stop. I have to say it is the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had that wasn't made at home. 

They have a large selection on their menu and each one is unique. I have had the original the buffalo chicken and a limited edition Cheesesteak Mac and they were all fantastic. They also offer salads and sandwiches, but I was not able to try those.

The restaurant is very clean and the wait staff is quite nice. If you have a chance to try this restaurant, you really should."}
{"text":"I placed a online order for pickup and it said it would be ready by 6:45pm. As i stood there waiting i saw a line that was not being served while two associates scrambled to get other orders out. I waited a half hour and that line never got helped !! So they all walked out."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight for the first time.  We decided to try the jalapeño popper Mac (without bacon), and my boyfriend went with the chipotle chicken mac. 

The girl at the counter was super nice and friendly, and she was cleaning the restaurant and picking up when there was no one at the counter. 

Great Mac and cheese; however, I didn't really get the jalapeño popper vibe. Unless the bacon pulls it all together, it was more or less just a really good, gooey Mac and cheese.

I tried a bite of the chipotle chicken Mac and that was delicious! We both went with regular size, which was pretty filling. Cheap dinner for two. Overall, while I was hoping for more of a jalapeño flavor, I was pleased and it was a nice spin on some different types of mac'n'cheese."}
{"text":"We are from the NW and boy could we use one of these places where we live!!! No joke this is da bomb for Americana comfort food! We wandered in here after seeing it from Costco yesterday and came back today for lunch. We ordered a cheese burger Mac and today's special \"Philly cheesesteak \" Mac. We also ordered a wedge salad. Although the salad was good the wedge of the wedge salad was non existent. It was flat and no middle?! Bummer but tasted good non the less. Now our first bite of expectation of my cheeseburger Mac was just jaw dropping good?I couldn't stop mmmm'ing thru every bite..of ooey gooey goodnes. My partner too! We have never had such good Mac n cheese EVER!!! So glad we came and conquered?"}
{"text":"Trendy but good! Usually I don't do trends but if you're serving my food in a mini cast iron skillet I'll get on that trend. I believe anything in a cast iron skillet has to be GOOD!  I'm my 2 week stay in Madison Macs saw me twice. The first time my eyes were bigger than my mouth but I trudged on with a large skillet of mac and cheese. The second visit I was more reserved getting he medium sized and I pretty much licked the skillet...I remembered I was in public and digressed. Overall a great place for lunch and I rediscovered my love of carbs and cheese."}
{"text":"Best Mac and cheese I ever had.  I can't replicate it at home, so I'm stuck making the drive and paying the price.  I had the philly cheese steak Mac.  

I have it 4 stars instead of 5 simply for the price, it's a bit high.  Probably worth it, but a dollar or so less would have cemented a 5 star rating.

If you've never tried it, you owe yourself at least one visit."}
{"text":"Nice comfort food. My favorite is the jalapeños poppers and my children love the chicken bacon ranch."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  It's really fancy Mac and cheese with a generous amount of cheese. The restaurant looks a bit industrial which i think suits it.  Bathrooms were clean. Staff was friendly and we didn't wait long for food. Would probably go here again."}
{"text":"I met a family from Illinois the other night and they wanted to know about this Macs place before deciding where to eat. After describing the restaurant to them, and getting hungry, I realized it was about time to write a review. 

Mac and cheese so many ways! 

My personal favorite is the Memphis mac and my fiancée loves the buffalo mac. All come in two sizes - regular and mac daddy. We enjoy it so much that we always get the mac daddy and take the left overs home. 

They have a few other options on the menu, salads and grilled sandwiches which are good, but you might as well get the mac and cheese at the mac and cheese restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the small popeye mac.  Portionwise, I think the small must be a 4' skillet.   It comes with spinach, mushrooms and fried onions.  Especially considering it's called popeye, it should have had more than 3 spinach leaves in it.  There was more mushrooms and onions thnan spinach! Regardless of the name, it would be better with more spinach.  I think the portion was fine for a small and considering the cost of cheese and what their overhead must be in a brand new building etc, the price was right too.  

What blew me away pricewise is the chocolate cake !!! $6.22 is outragous !   ... it was only a single slice, average size.  It wasnt overly sweet, but very rich.  If you want to cut your cost, but still be happy with your meal and want desert, split the cake with someone.  The richness and density is enough for 2 people, especially folowing a big serving of mac n cheese.    Still doesnt justify them charging so much for it in the first place !!

Front end service was 2 teenage or young adult girls who were very nice ... not like many kids their age in service industry who hardly make eye contact, dont say hi or seem to give a crap if everythinng's good.  Food did seem to take a bit long, but not unreasonable.  They were very busy.  It was Saturday at noon.  

A suggestion for them - the drivethru behind the restaurant must be Starbucks ?  I suggest putting a sign AT the corner of the bldg (maybe hung on the side?), so people dont think you can get out of parking lot by driving around the bldg.   The lot and drivethru were busy and It wasn't easy to back out of the drivethru."}
{"text":"Fun little place when you're looking for something a bit different than just another burger joint. 

The staff has always been friendly and helpful, and patient with people taking their time deciding. Seating seems a little cramped, but not so much that it's uncomfortable. 

The food is good. The limited time Philly Cheese Steak Mac they had was out of this world tasty, but alas, it's no longer an option, at least the last time I was there. If they added it as a regular menu item I might be in a bit of trouble. Everything else I've had is just slightly above average good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  The first time I tried the Memphis Mac and the second was Popeye Mac.  The Memphis Mac has pulled BBQ pork, that and the other toppings really took a normal cheesy noodle to the next level.  I really enjoyed the Popeye as well but felt that it'd be better with more spinach.  This is a good place to go if you want some comfort food but don't want to put in the cooking time."}
{"text":"I stopped here to try it out on the way to a meeting. I really liked the concept and some of the menu combinations were very exciting.  I ordered the Chipotle Mac.  The large size was more than enough for me, but the flavor was rather bland.  The toppings and sauce were good, but the Mac itself needed some flavor.  Hopefully it was just a one time issue."}
{"text":"Went on opening day with my two kids.  I ordered the Memphis, and the kids got a regular and a mama's.  when the food came out, they brought me the chicken bacon ranch rather than the Memphis.  but they quickly corrected that and let me keep the CBR Mac.  Everything was really good.  Not the cheapest, but it was plenty of food and it was fast.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is bar far the best Mac and cheese I've ever had. Drive all the way from Chicago to get some and the drive was worth it."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Macs. The counter staff was pleasant and accommodating. I had the baked potato which was delicious, cheesy in a good way. The ingredients were fresh and plentiful. Bacon,chives, and potatoes sat atop a huge portion of Mac and cheese. The noodles were perfectly cooked! 
Way too much food for me. My wife had the Popeyes. It was also delicious but more less generous with the spinach. The menu has a great deal of variety.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a good idea for a restaurant. This place promises delicious Mac and cheese and it delivers! My favorite is the buffalo chicken mac but you're sure to find a dish you like here. Unless you don't like pasta and cheese. Prices are decent and love the patio outside."}
{"text":"I had Mama's Mac to go and it was good, but I was expecting the mac and cheese itself to be super super cheesy. I enjoyed it but will probably not drive out there again"}
{"text":"getting some cheese on cheese on cheese action, tonight. :-)  for less than $9 and inder 5 min, i have the melted chesse in front of me.  i like it.  may be a bit less salt would be grest.   

the #4 popeye is nice and vegan friendly. 4*

i will be back."}
{"text":"Great concept. Great for kids and families. You place your order at the counter. They have many types of \"macs\" to choose from, wedge salads, melts and kids meals. Macs are served in a cast iron pan. I ordered the Jalapeno mac with extra jalapenos. It arrived with little blobs of cream cheese throughout with bacon sprinkled on as well. Surprisingly creamy and good. Food was hot. Lots of tables and chairs. Chairs are plastic and kind of a turn off. Maybe they do not want ppl to stick around. LOL. We ordered a wedge salad too. It too arrived in a cast iron server. I ordered blue cheese dressing. Did not like it. It tasted metallic. Nice clean bathrooms. Pepsi products. If you are craving mac and cheese, you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"I was a blue box kid and always said Mac and Cheese was my favorite food -- ordering it at any restaurant I could, so you can trust me when I say this chain has perfected the art! They definitely live up to the hype and are well known by now because of all the Dells tourists. We tried three kinds on our visit to the Sun Prairie location: the baked potato, the chicken bacon ranch and the philly. They were all good, unique, flavorful dishes and nobody was disappointed except my son who can't stand mac and cheese (shriek!)--that was the only bad thing about the experience trying enjoy it with a hater who couldn't find anything he wanted except a plate of hot dog meat and piece of chocolate cake (seriously, they need to put that cake in one of those skillets, warm it up, and throw some vanilla ice cream and toppings on it). We got there at 11:30 just before the lunch rush...the line was literally out the door. They don't list the calories anywhere probably because there are none. Oh my God, please don't come to Illinois...it will be the end of me."}
{"text":"Really great fast casual specializing in Mac and cheese. But this is no ordinary Mac and cheese. This is Mac and cheese all grown up and made into a meal. We had the Memphis, which is a pulled pork with bbq sauce and amazing and a chipotle chicken, which was also super tasty. Love the bread thing. The large is too big for me but I order it anyway and take home what I can't finish. 

Service is pleasant and mostly quick."}
{"text":"Great way to enjoy my diet cheat day. I got the Buffalo chicken mac, my wife and one friend got the loaded baked potato mac, and another got the chicken bacon ranch. We all got Mac Daddy size.  I probably could have devoured the whole thing, but decided not to overindulge.  Leftovers! Good stuff!  If I'm in Sun Prarie again, and looking for a fun meal, I know where to go.  Staff was friendly  and it was a nice chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ventured out to try Macs today. Not that Mac n Chesse is something I should be eating on a regular basis (gotta lose some lb's) but the Restaurant.com certificate was too enticing. 

A bit like Noodles in atmosphere - order at the counter, it's brought out to your table. Impressive menu with many fun variations of Mac n Cheese - plus melts (sandwiches) and salads too. We dove in and tried the Mama's Mac (with hot dogs) and the Buffalo Chicken Mac. Both were VERY yummy. Comes out in a hot skillet, came with two pieces to toasty bread. Well cooked, very flavorful - good value. Our only \"note\" - most dishes come in two sizes, a small and large. We went for large and probably could have done the small. It's ok, now we have some for later!

Staff was very nice and super friendly. The place could have been a bit cleaner as there were several tables with dishes on them when we got there. Very good place though and fun experience."}
{"text":"Not bad food. You get what is expected for tastes. The kids like it because it isn't much more than store bought mixes with some dressed up toppings. Over priced for what amounts to super casual dining. Tables were sticky and the bathroom was a mess when my kids went in. Overall not really impressed, save a little money and get your home cooked Kraft Mac and cheese and throw some Spam and tater tots in and enjoy a cleaner version. All that said, they were busy with lots of school age customers."}
{"text":"I had the loaded baked potato variation and it was great! I will definitely go back to try other flavors that had be second guessing my first choice. The portion size was hardy and had to save half for later. This is another restaurant concept that makes you say \"why didn't I think of this.\""}
{"text":"Walk dont run. Totally glutony, on my behalf. Mac and Cheese places are popping up all over the midwest. MACS tries but does not deliver. I felt like I was in a greasy Chipolte styled Mac and Cheese chain. My friends loved it. I felt like I ate a brick of greese and oil. I will say the vegetables on my dish I ordered were crisp but, it reminded me more of a casserole that I would find at my church pot luck."}
{"text":"I l-o-v-e mac and cheese, and MACS does not disappoint! I've had the Original, Mama's Mac, and Chipotle varieties - all amazing. I love that they come served in a little cast iron pan, it totally adds to the experience. Overall, a nice quick option if you're in a pasta-y mood.

(bonus: they offer online ordering!)"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot near Costco and target.  We tried the buffalo chicken as well as momma's Mac & cheese,  both were very good.  Open and airy location and they bring your meals to you if you are dining in.

We will return to try more things including the four cheese melt which I'm told is excellent."}
{"text":"Yummy! I had not eaten mac & cheese in quite a while, and I was in the Sun Prairie area at lunch time, so MACS was perfect. 

I ordered the popeye dish, which is mac & cheese with spinach, onions and mushrooms. This was my attempt at eating a \"healthy\" mac & cheese dish at MACS. (This seemed to have the most veggies out of all the options.)

It was incredibly tasty and creamy. I ordered the regular size, which was perfect for lunch since it wasn't too filling. I felt satisfied but not disgustingly full.

The staff was very friendly and energetic. Fun atmosphere with a tin tile ceiling!

I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"What a busy place on a Saturday afternoon!  My daughter and I have never been to a Macs before and we were not disappointed.   The options were vast and and diverse. We decided to go a little mainstream with chicken bacon ranch mac n cheese. It was so rich we shared a mac daddy serving and there were still leftovers! We will be back to try others for sure..."}
{"text":"I was pretty underwhelmed.  I had the chicken, bacon, ranch mac.  It was fine.  Not great, not terrible and way too expensive (around $7). 

The place was really clean considering how busy it was and service was friendly.  

No major complaints.  It was just alright."}
{"text":"I am in love.  It is like the Chipotle of mac and cheese. I fight every urge to go there daily. 

I ordered the mac and cheese with pulled pork. I skipped the extra sauce because I did not want it too liquidy. It was a marvelous option. The pork and the mac was paired well. I would have skipped the onion straws. They were unneeded and a little too overpowering.

My only negative point?  The base mac is the same. It is only the toppings which differ. Perhaps, they could try a different base and change up the cheese mix.

The price is a touch high but you REALLY do get a good chunk of food.

I did not try the salads but I saw them. They looked a little basic/small for the price. Truthfully, I am not going to this place unless I get Mac and Cheese. My advice?  Go with someone, get a couple and share to try them all!"}
{"text":"The #9 is the best! A regular is 5.99 and a large is 10. If you love Mac and Cheese you'll love this place !"}
{"text":"The best mac & cheese of my life, no joke. Working through trying every menu item; so far the favorite is the Chipotle Chicken. Get the mac daddy size so you can take some home & enjoy it again!"}
{"text":"Does a great job at what is supposed to do: make great Mac and cheese. I tried the buffalo chicken. Would instantly eat here again."}
{"text":"Yum 

There are not many restaurants that my whole family is equally excited about. We range in age from 18 months to 37 years young. The battle of McDonalds or anywhere else is not always one I want to fight...until now. The conversation usually goes something like this: 
Me: Where do you want to go? 
One or both of my children: McDonalds! 
Me: How about Macs? 
Children: Yes! 
Boom. We are all happy! 

I love the Memphis mac. Second to that is the jalapeño popper mac. My hubby and I order the larger size and split it. It seems bigger and cheaper than ordering two of the smaller ones. 

Thanks Mac for helping settle the \"Where should we eat dilemma?\"! 
Happy Fam!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place a 10/5 stars. from the moment you walk in you are greeted with warmth. The staff is amazing and prompt in making the food and helping you decide if you're a first timer. I absolutely love cheese and there is no better place to get it than Wisconsin. This is some of the best Mac and cheese I've ever had. Just writing this review is making my mouth salivate. If you are visiting the dells, you MUST go to Macs. It will be the best decision you've made all week :) 

I recommend getting the jalapeño popper Mac or the buffalo Mac, they both have some heat but it's not overwhelming at all! Cheesy golden and great!"}
{"text":"I tried the buffalo macaroni as well as the pulled pork macaroni and both were very good and creative.  The only knock I might have is that the macaroni base was probably not that special on its own.  Like, I'm not sure I'd drive here just for that.  However, I would return for the many creative things they do on top of it."}
{"text":"If you want Mac N Cheese - this is the place.  Their mac n cheese is quite good.  And by good I mean rich and tasty.  It's pretty heavy so I don't think it's something I can fit in to my regular repertoire of restaurants, but if I am looking for some good comfort food this would be my go to place."}
{"text":"This is a fun, small chain.  They have a variety of options.  I settled on the original mac and cheese, and my husband ordered the taco mac.  While I thought the dish was overall pretty good, there was an odd burnt taste, and not one reminiscent of burnt cheese or time spent under the broiler.  For that, my review reflects a very average experience.  Of note, I tried my husband's taco mac, and it was great!  It was very flavorful, and full of flavor.

The service here was quick, and the prices good.  The area is rather nice- having moved out of this area 10 years ago, I was pleased to see the new growth and development.  I mention this because this establishment is a great option while out shopping in the area."}
{"text":"If you want Mac N Cheese, this is pretty good stuff. My favorite is the Jalepeno popper or the Buffalo Chicken version. Both very tasty. My wife likes the Taco Mac.

Portion size: Honestly, the \"regular\" dish looks pretty small at first. But it's pretty heavy, rich food. Finish the whole thing and you should NOT be hungry. 

Kid friendly, as long as your kids are ok with something that includes real cheese, not the watery blue box mac that my kids like."}
{"text":"We love this place so much and are glad it is so close to where we live.  I've probably tried at least half of the specialty macs.  I've only had the hangover mac once and it was crazy delicious but was a bit too much I decided afterwards.  I am surprised how good the taco mac is because the combination seems odd but it totally works.  We always eat here when we have people in town visiting.  I assume I will be picking it up on the way home frequently once winter sets in."}
{"text":"MACS is a good meal.  Real good.  I've been here 3 times, and each time I've been more impressed.  I usually get the Chipotle Mac, and it hasn't disappointed me.  The ingredients blend well, and it has nice texture.

Why only 3 stars?  Well, I feel like the price point is higher than it needs to be for what you get.  I would only go there with coupons (which we get in the circular that comes to our place)."}
{"text":"MACS....comfort food even when you do not needing comforting!  

The mac and cheese is undeniably outstanding.  I have tried the Buffalo, the Chicken Ranch, the Memphis (in a sandwich), the Taco....all very, very good.

The service has been a little uneven.  I think they misplaced my order once, but overall they are okay.

The soda machine drips out of the ice maker and the soda dispensers too much, causing sticky hands...they really should get that fixed.

I will, of course, be back again...and probably again...."}
{"text":"Good food, good portions, nice atmosphere. But...hard to justify dinner for two of Mac n cheese plus (non-alcoholic) drinks at $25-30. Sorry."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Mac & Cheese. They have a plethora of different kinds of Mac & Cheese. I myself would never think of Mac & Cheese is something to order out- it's easy enough to make well at home, and how interesting can it possibly be? Enter MACS. There's dishes with hot dogs, chipotle flavored dishes, even ones with spinach! Chances are, even if you're not the biggest fan of Mac & Cheese, you'll find a dish here you'd enjoy. 

The environment was clean and modern. The staff pleasant."}
{"text":"Excellent mac n cheese restaurant.  My daughter got the kids size original mac.  i got the Popeye, and my wife got the jalapeno popper and we split a house salad.  They all come out piping hot in a cast iron skillet, and the salads are very fresh.  (If you're anything like us bring your own hot sauce!  Although they do have sriracha at the tables)"}
{"text":"I think this is the only place I know that focuses on mac and cheese, which is surprising seeing as this is the dairyland of America. They have a large variety of mac and cheese variants, which caters to a variety of tastes. I go for either the traditional or the chicken bacon ranch - I think the different types of savory make sense together and don't clash. They also have melts and wedge salads, but you should come here for mac and cheese - I mean, it's in their name. As for the quality of the mac and cheese itself, it's not bad but could be improved. The macaroni is done well - not overcooked or undercooked. The cheese, while rich, has a very slight grainy texture to it that I find very unusual. I've never had that in any other kind of mac and cheese, so perhaps the establishment should investigate?"}
{"text":"Ok, I'll admit that I'm only rating on the one single thing I've ever ordered. (Ordered maybe 5 times total) I really love the bacon and jalapeño. Sooo awesome. The dollops of cream cheese (I think that's what it is) on top make a unique bite. There is a smoky flavor in it too. My favorite from the first visit, so I've never tried anything else."}
{"text":"Visited on Oct 2, 2015. Ordered the Memphis Mac & shared with my daughter. We both got violently sick & puked a couple hours after eating here. This was the only food we shared throughout the entire day, so I know we got sick from Mac's. My wife had a different plate and felt fine. I'm guessing the pork was rancid. I'll never be going back..."}
{"text":"It was our first experience and the food was deciduous! We will definitely return when we're in the area."}
{"text":"The best thing this place has going for it is the cute presentation. 

We had the original and Mama's because the counter person when we were able to get her attention mentioned the ranch one when I asked what sells the most, and we don't do ranch. 

Food came in good time served piping hot in the skillets. Bread was not hot, oddly. Staff never came by during our dinner our visit and didn't seem that engaged or service oriented when we went to the counter."}
{"text":"There's mac n cheese and then there's MACS version of mac n cheese! I love their gourmet twist to this otherwise very casual average joe snack. The portions are great and the flavor profiles very playful!

Give this place a sure try even if you're not a fan of mac n cheese. You won't regret I'm sure!"}
{"text":"I really dig this place. Good food, chill atmosphere. I almost get the loaded baked potato meal every time. Can't go wrong with Mac and cheese anytime."}
{"text":"This amazing place is heaven for all Mac and cheese lovers. There are options for all from spicy to bbq. They combine the most random food items to taste like heaven. Be adventurous and try out different meals here, it's worth it. If you have the time, dine in to receive your meal in a hot iron skillet. It's a nice added touch!

If you live in the area, check your mail often for coupons. We often get buy one meal, get one half off or $5 off of $20 takeout.

I suggest the Memphis Mac! It's my two favorite meals in one. Well done MACs well done."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try max since we saw two of them in the Dalles so we decided to go to the Sun Prairie one which is closer to our home he had the Memphis barbecue which was amazing and I had the taco one which also was amazing we got the Mac daddy's which is enough to bring home and have another meal I would completely recommended this place!! Yummy"}
{"text":"MACS might have the best mac & cheese I've ever had. Perfectly cooked pasta, a creamy sauce base, and a layer of melted cheese that was just a little crunchy around the edges. I could probably eat myself sick on it.

I specifically tried the Memphis Mac (BBQ pork and crispy onions) and the barbecue was perfect for cutting some of the richness of the dairy base. I also tried a bite of my boyfriend's buffalo chicken macaroni and it was also very tasty. 

We ordered our dinner for takeout and we were given a pickup time of about ten minutes from when we ordered it. We were in and out of the restaurant in a literal minute - we walked in, gave our names, were handed a bag, and walked back out. Not bad for 6:45 on a Friday night!

Though we weren't inside the restaurant long, it was a cute little space that seemed clean and cozy and pulled heavily from the design of Noodles. While MACS and Noodles are on par design-wise, MACS blows Noodles' macaroni and cheese out of the water. Because of this fact, I am grateful that I live on the other side of Madison, lest I end up too deep into a mac and cheese habit."}
{"text":"Everyhing we order to go is goo except the big daddy.  Also missing the sause.  Last time i even asked for extra sause and got none"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner after a good workout, which was perfect because we were very hungry and didn't feel guilty for eating gluttonous mac & cheese.  

I got the Hangover and my friend got the Loaded Baked Potato.  The girl at the counter was very friendly and quick to place our orders.  Our food came out in about 10 minutes or so, and you could tell it was freshly made.  I love that they bake the mac & cheese in skillets because it gives it a nice crispiness.  The only downside is that they give you plastic forks to eat it with and that is not conductive to picking off the crusty bits of deliciousness at the edges of the skillet.  

I didn't try my friend's dish, but she said it was fantastic.  The Hangover dish that I got was the perfect balance of dinner and breakfast, basically mac & cheese with freshly cooked bacon, sautéed veggies, crispy hash browns, and a good quality hot dog.  The added siracha on top added the perfect heat element.  The mac & cheese itself was delicious and flavorful.  

Both my friend and I will definitely be returning here... but only after a good workout."}
{"text":"Would have been five but the second time I went the top of my mac and cheese wasn't as crusty .... Wait who am I kidding it was still freaking delicious! 5 stars! This place is amazing! They get through orders quickly even during the noon hour. You always get a napkin and fork with your to go order. Great employees who seem happy about working and best of all great food for a reasonable price. 5ish for a regular Mac and cheese! A winner in my book!"}
{"text":"For what it is worth, the concept of MACs is extremely clever. This is Wisconsin where cheese is king. Why not start a restaurant that serves one of the best American comfort foods being pasta with great cheeses? Winning idea!

I dined where with my sister during the weekday a little bit after the lunch rush. The restaurant was pretty quite with only a few diners. Very clean and not overly sophisticated. For my dish, I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Mac, large. Had someone told me the portion sizes were going to be so large, I would have gotten a small! It was impossible or me to eat it all in one sitting. I saved more than half for lunch the next day. Mac n cheese is already a heavy meal when it is served solo. Adding chipotle sauce and chicken to it makes it even more fulfilling. 

Overall, I was satisfied with my selection. I would have cut back on the chipotle sauce. It seem to overpower the cheese a tad bit. From my observation, the chicken is white meat which is a HUGE plus in my book seeing that I do not eat dark meat chicken. 

Service was a bit slow. Took about 12 minutes to get our food despite us being 2 of 5 total customers. My sister and I were not in any rush so it was fine. Cashier/waitress apologized for the long wait. Again. Not a big deal. She was super friendly. 


I would like to give MACs another try ordering something else off their menu. Considering I am dieting, I am not sure if this is a good idea but what the hell!
They are a big on the $ side but considering the portion sizes, you really can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Meh. For the price we paid for two small skillets, not that great of macaroni and cheese. $18 for two very small boring macaroni."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant surprise to find how many choices there were and how much food you could get for your dollar spent. This was a first time visit and I was very happy with my food. Certainly not a high end restaurant but wholesome comfort food that tasted great."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try MACS after recently moving to the Sun Prairie area.  We were VERY impressed by their selection of mac 'n cheese dishes as well as the clean atmosphere.  

We each ordered the chicken bacon ranch mac 'n cheese and were not disappointed.  Very filling, hearty meal that had a lot of flavor.  The staff is incredibly friendly and was very patient with us while we decided on what to order.  We will absolutely be going back; MUCH better than Noodles and Company!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of pasta...so when I saw Macs we had to go. We've now been 3 times. Comfort food that's fast, pretty close to homemade but with a little pizazz. Don't plan on coming here if you're on a diet ;)

My husband and I have gotten different meals each time so we can try as many as possible. Good thing the menu isn't too big and the staff is friendly. It's really cute inside too but it's kind of tiny. It always seems like there are loud children eating next to us. 

1st trip: He got the Buffalo Chicken which had just the right amount of sauce, heat and blu cheese. I got the Memphis Mac which is bbq pulled pork. Usually I'm a big fan of bbq anything but this time it was a little over powering. Winner: Buffalo Chicken.

2nd trip: He got the Jalapeño Popper. Not much to say other than it was awesome! So creamy. Not too spicy. Can't wait to try it again. I got the Taco Wedge Salad. It was good, but it wasn't comforting like a big bowl of creamy mac and cheese. I'd say if you want a salad go somewhere else. Winner: Jalapeño Popper.

3rd trip: He got the special which was Philly Cheesesteak. It was AMAZING, the right amount of meat and veggies to noodles. YUM. I got the Chicken Bacon Ranch because I couldn't decide and the girl behind the counter said it was her favorite. Well it wasn't my favorite. In fact I didn't really like it at all. Winner: Philly Cheesesteak. 

We will obviously be back to try out a few more."}
{"text":"MACS was good. You get more for your money with the Wisconsin Mac and Cheese at Noodles & Company but the mac and cheese at MACS has better flavor."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it just seems like overpriced MAC and cheese. I really don't have anything special at all to write about it. The 2 kids don't like the MAC and cheese here and would rather go to several other restaurants close by. I have no idea why this rates a 4."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of the one in the Dells, so we were in Madison and drove 15 miles out of the way to get here.  I had the Taco Mac and Cheese.  My wife got the ol' standby, Jalapeño Popper.
This is just as amazing as the one in the Dells, in a small strip mall.  They honor the MACs card (Buy 10, get 1 free).  This is some of the most amazing Mac and cheese I've ever had and now that I live in Florida, I miss it like crazy!
Bring a MACs to the Orlando area please!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fatty, gooey cheesy goodness. I've had the jalapeño popper Mac, Tex Mac and Memphis Mac. I loved the first two and the Memphis Mac is ok. 

The service is great. Friendly, efficient and fast. I've also ordered online and it was an easy straightforward process. I can't recommend this place enough for yummy Mac n cheese. It is a little bit overpriced but I don't mind. It's Mac n cheese like I can't make at home."}
{"text":"For the price you pay.... You expect something delicious. What you get is..... Okay. The pasta really doesn't have anything special, just the toppings that get thrown on top..... And bread to hard to chew. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"M.A.C.S., which stands for Macaroni and Cheese Shop, is an easy place to love. I mean, what's not to adore about a restaurant that offers ten different takes on the ultimate comfort food: Mac and cheese.  And after enjoying a flavor packed meal that was made to order with fresh ingredients, I think I'm looking forward to a return trip much as my tween daughter and teen son.  

MACS is located across from the Sun Prairie Woodman's and shares space in a building with a Starbucks and an Elements massage studio.  The minimalist interior is an ode to the Dairy State, with cheddar-colored walls and cheesy references covering the wall by the entrance.   We arrived after the main dinner rush and the restaurant was surprising clean despite its newfound popularity as a family dining destination.

In addition to mac and cheese, MACS serves up six different melts, three wedge salads and three types of desserts.  They also offer a kid's menu and a gluten free cheesy potato option to boot.  Very cool, MACS, very cool.  

The mac and cheese dishes come in individual-sized cast iron skillets with two serving sizes: regular (about 6 inches in diameter) and Mac Daddy (about 9 inches in diameter).  The skillet is a great serving vessel for this meal, as some of the cheese bakes onto the sides, creating a delicious crunchy foil to the sinfully creamy interior.  The only drawback is that is near impossible to scrape the baked-on cheese off, since the flimsy black plastic fork that comes with the meal is no match for that tasty baked-on crust.    

The ordering process is similar to Noodles & Company: 1) queue up, reviewing the menu options above the cashier while you wait; 2) order and pay for your meal; 3) receive a number and find a table and 4) an employee delivers the food and the fun began.  

The Popeye MAC (provolone, mozzarella, spinach, sautéed onions and mushrooms) I ordered needs to be renamed the Magic Mushroom, since the pile of expertly sautéed, fresh mushrooms were the highlight of this dish.  Other than needing more spinach to balance the richness of the dish, MACS impressed with how well they prepared my order.  With perfectly cooked al dente ribbed macaroni, the crunchy, golden brown bread crumb topping and the sinfully creamy cheese sauce, this is comfort food done right.  

Risking the potential loss of my digits, I snuck a sample of the Original MAC and the Mama's MAC (cheddar and mozzarella cheese with fried hot dogs) before they were completely devoured by my ravenous children.    These two dishes matched the well-executed preparation of my dish, making me eagerly await my next opportunity to explore the other menu options.   Here's to that day coming sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 regular Macs: Cheeseburger Mac, Buffalo Mac, Jalapeno Popper Mac and the Mama's Mac. This was the perfect amount of food for 3 of us. The Jalapeno Popper Mac was my personal favorite. The Buffalo Mac had a little too much blue cheese for my taste. I thought that they all were pretty tasty, overall, but I would recommend they put diced pickles on the Cheeseburger Mac and bigger chunks of jalapeno in the Jalapeno Popper Mac. The staff was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back to try more of the Mac specialties!"}
{"text":"Oh cheesy goodness. We have eaten here twice and continue to love the macaroni and cheese and sandwiches. Great place for some comfort food.

What we have tried:


No. 7 Chicken Bacon Ranch MAC We really love this Mac and cheese. Great flavor, creamy and cheesy.


No. 9 Memphis MAC - Not a fan...the BBQ sauce is lackluster.


No. 1 Original MAC - Not too bad. Very creamy but greasy. They need to use a better quality of cheese to get rid of the grease.

Chipotle Chicken MELT - Outstanding sandwich. Great favors, moist and just the right size. 

Buffalo Chicken MELT - Just the right size but a little dry. Good flavors."}
{"text":"First time I stopped I got it to go.  I opened it as soon as I got to my car and it was Luke warm.  Tasmte wise it was good but I like my macNcheese warmer.  The second time here I had the Popeye with spinach, mushroom and onion.  We ate at a table and everything was piping hot.  Husband had the buffalo chicken and loved it.  He isn't a Mac and cheese type of guy but he said he would ce back.  Three kids had the regular child's Mac and cheese with hi milk, chips and apple slices.  Everyone cleaned their plate except my husband who ordered the papa size Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"It's not bad for a fast food place.  The Mac and cheese by itself reminds me of a softer version of Panera's Mac n cheese.  The toppings are what give it the flavor!  They could go without the burnt sliver of bread they put with the plates.  The staff is usually friendly even when busy but it's always a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"We love to eat at MACS when we're in the area.  Great comfort food and good service.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Very good food for fast food place! Not a fan of seating with metal chairs and small interior but nice to eat outside or to go"}
{"text":"I had to try this place out after hearing so much about it. I would have to liken it to a different noodle based company, both in overall style and ambience.  The staff was really helpful and friendly, which helped with not having any idea of how they did things.

For a mac and cheese specialty shop, they had more options than I thought they would.  I ended up getting a cheesesteak special. Now, I like to eat, but the sizes are deceptive. Both looked small to me, so I ordered the Mac Daddy. I barely finished it as it was mounded to near overflowing.  Not a bad problem, but it was unexpected.  The dish itself was very good. A bit greasier than I would like, but great flavor.  I was less of a fan of the garlic toast tips. They were way too salty for me.

Overall, I really liked the food. I'm not sure how often I can see myself here, but they do have a good product."}
{"text":"I always order the spicy and delish jalapeño Mac with bacon.  It never fails to satisfy, nor the leftovers.  I was in the mood for chicken, so I stepped out and ordered the Buffalo Mac.  Yeah. Um.  The cheese is gritty, it's not spicy, and I don't think the 3 shreds of chicken justify the $1 extra pricing.  I asked, what kind of chicken do you use, and they said chopped chicken breast.  No, this looks like 1/10th of a shredded chicken breast.  So sad. 
They also do not offer wi-fi."}
{"text":"I won't drive here from downtown Madison specifically again, but if I'm in the area I may stop. I think it is pretty hard to mess up mac'n'cheese (which they don't), but it is difficult to make transcendent mac'n'cheese (which they don't quite). 

The interior as a kind of Chipotle or Noodles & Company vibe inside. Lots of Wisconsin rah-rah stuff on the walls, predictably.

I had Memphis, with pulled pork and little crunchies on top. It was great! Really good idea to mix up the texture with the crunchies. Companion had buffalo chicken or something of that sort, his was not as good as mine - no crunchies and the oil from hot sauce pooled up. 

They serve it up in little tiny faux-cast iron pans which have adorable hot pad mitts on the handle. This was the best part, these cute tiny mitts.

Takeaway: strip mall food that's pretty good, stop if you're around."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times and it always looks packed.  I went Saturday night on a whim.  I will start by saying the staff is uber friendly.  Happy to answer questions and give recommendations.  The store was very clean considering patrons leave there skillets and trash at the table.  There was a guy flying around cleaning and conversing with patrons.  If he isn't an owner or manager, he deserves a nice bonus.

I ordered the large Mama's Mac and a drink.  The Meal Deal included a freshly homemade chocolate chip cookie for less than a dollar more.  Okay, sold.  I managed to find a table and awaited my dinner.  It arrived bubbly hot.  I thought the portion was huge and with the richness of the Mac and Cheese, I only ate half.  I had a nice portion and a cookie for lunch the next day.   I would be interested in coming back and trying another flavor from their menu of 10 different choices.

This is a completely different place than Noodles & Co.  So I don't get the comparisons.  I found the price to be similar or less costly than Noodles.  If I was seeking a real Mac and Cheese while I'm out and about, I would happy find my way back to MACS."}
{"text":"I went to MACS in April of 2016. As a Macaroni and Cheese fan myself, I was highly impressed with the food and the service. I tried the Bacon Chicken Ranch Macaroni and Cheese. The food is quite unhealthy (which is to be expected, of course!) so I won't be here as frequently as I'd really like to be. I know I will end up back here eventually though."}
{"text":"A craving for Mac & Cheese combined with jet lag and moving apartments, led us to MACS last Saturday. This wasn't our first encounter with MACS.

On my first visit, I ordered the regular Chipotle Mac & Cheese. On this particular visit, I ordered the Buffalo Mac and ordered it in the Mac Daddy size. The portion size on the Mac Daddy is huge. I was thinking ahead and planning for leftovers. However, we saw a couple sharing one of these which is probably a smart idea given the caloric intake. 

I like my food spicy, but haven't found a good option at MACS. I might try the Jalepeno option on the next visit. But, besides that I was a fan of the Buffalo Mac over the Chipotle.

Ordering is always quick and easy. For fast food and considering it is mac and cheese, it is pricey when you add in drinks. But, it beats buying all the ingredients on your own only to make a sub par in comparison mac and cheese dish. 

They also have outdoor seating here which is nice in the summer. Overall, MACS is a great place to fulfill that craving for a cheesy dish. I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh the best birthday lunch on planet! 
It was so delicious.
I got the chicken bacon ranch mac & cheese and my date got the pulled pork mac & cheese and they were both phenomenal. 
The mac & cheese was very creamy and was bubbling hot when I came to the table. We both got the regular sizes instead of the Mack daddy size. Which was plenty of food to fill us up.
The atmosphere is very casual and open and on this particular day a little cold so you may want to bring a coat or a sweatshirt to warm up.
I will definitely be returning for more mac & cheese!"}
{"text":"WoW!!!  Saw this new place, and though we would give it a try.  How hard can it be to choose between 12 menu items...pretty damn hard once you start reading them--you will want one of each !!!

We finally settled on\"Cheeseburger Mac (actually taste like a Big Mac but better.) , \"Jalapeño Popper\" (has a kick to it), and the \"Taco Mac\" (son ate it to quick so I didn't get a taste-but it must have been good for how fast it went down).  All were delicious.  I don't think it really matters what you get, it's all going to be good.  

Even the table next to us were ranting how good it was. Not sure what all was delivered to the table, but I do know they were talking mostly of the \"Memphis Mac\" that one ordered.  

Portions come in three sizes.  They have the serving dish size on counter for viewing.  We all did the mac daddy size because it does't look that big.   It's more then plenty.  The middle size would have been good enough.   After they load it, it's holding more then it looks.  

The establishment is small with limited seating (about 15-20 tables).  Very clean (then it should be, it's new) and staff is on top of things.  They are quick to clean off unused tables.  I was impressed with the staff in how the cleared tables. They didn't just push it from the table, to the chairs, to the floor.  Leftovers were scooped up and disposed of properly. 

Staff stay engaged with customers while waiting for food and after to make sure your visit is the best."}
{"text":"Expensive and not very good don't waste your time or your money go to noodles and company"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Mac N Cheese except for the ones in this place. Jalapeño popper Mac N Cheese is so unbelievably yummy..my favorite on menu."}
{"text":"Pretty good mac and cheese, but not vegetarian friendly.  The menu has some awesomely creative meat options, so I decided to order one of the meat dishes, but substitute the meat for extra cheese.  First off, they don't let you substitute for free, so that's an upcharge.  Second, my super-expensive dish came out the first time with bacon on it, even though I had made it clear that I didn't eat bacon and that I wanted the bacon substituted for cheese.  Just ridiculous.  First you don't have any incredibly creative vegetarian options, then you upcharge for a vegetarian trying to get a meat dish without the meat, and then your chef thinks the woman must be an idiot for not wanting bacon in it and assumes that he knows best and that it really will taste better with bacon.  It's very far on the East side, and we will not be making the trek out there again.  I'm the one who loves mac and cheese, so it's not like my husband would ever crave this again.  Really disappointed with the overall experience, and not worth the drive out."}
{"text":"For all your comfort food needs come here. Mac and cheese is my all time favorite and the twist MACS puts on theirs makes it spectacular! I love the Popeye Mac and cheese. The veggies are cook perfectly and adds a nice flavor to a pan of Mac and cheese. I recommend the regular size if you are hungry. If you are starving then upgrade to the larger size, but be prepared to take some home. 

The restaurant is clean and the service is fast. You can order take out and it will be ready within 5 minutes. If you get a drink you can make it a combo and add a cookie. 

I wish they had some other options like a side salad. Or a combo of mac and cheese bowl and a half a sandwich. That would add a whole lot of variability to their menu, but you are limited to just a few options when you go here and should be craving mac and cheese because that is what they are good at and the best option on the menu."}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch so I decided to stop by Macs to get some good ol' mac n cheese, the first impression I had was that it was a nice area, very new buildings so it is very modern and has a very nice feel to this restaurant. There were also a good amount of people there. So because I was on a time crunch, I did order my meal to go, I ordered the Hangover Mac n Cheese, which came in the Big Daddy size only. I believe I paid about 9.50 or so. 

So I thought that the quality of the mac was very good, it was creamy and wasn't lumpy so it had a good quality cheese, but I believe they used hot dog meat? It tasted like a Franks hot dog and the bread was very stale. I did think it was also strange that the meals didn't include drinks, but that's alright. 

I was suprised that they only had one waitress who was supposed to tend to the cashier, and busting tables, and making sure everything was going okay. 

I would go back again to try the other Mac n cheeses."}
{"text":"Buffalo ranch chicken is really quite good.  Regular size is just perfect along with a side salad.  I would suggest ordering online or by phone or you will have to wait...it's worth the wait but I am impatient."}
{"text":"That's a fascinating amount of carbohydrates I just ingested.  

It's hard to screw up Mac and Cheese, but Macs tries its best.  Mac and cheese is cheap, so in order to get the most from you, they overcharge you.  Then, they slop a pile of their brand of glop onto a clever skillet tray, cover it with some toppings to disguise the fact that it's basically been sitting out for hours waiting for someone to order it, and then run it through a salamander to heat it up.  The end result is acceptable, but it ain't great.  

I'll probably go back, but not too often."}
{"text":"Let me just be clear- the environment and service of this place is awesome and I had no trouble with it. The only problem I have is with my personal opinions on how the food tastes. To me, I found their mac n cheese to be gross. I tried both the original and the Memphis Mac (I wanted to give it a fair shot so I went back again) Although neither of them really hit the spot for me. I found it to be way to greasy. The cheese and noodles were so coated with grease that I just felt disgusting eating it and I couldn't finish my whole plate. I usually like mac n cheese, I eat it all the time, but this specific one is just a no from me"}
{"text":"New to the Madison area so of course I come to Yelp to help me out!  Dined here last week.  You enter and order at a counter, put a number on your table and they bring it out to you when it is done.  Super casual place.  

Food: Oh my goodness!  My comfort food weakness is mac and cheese so of course after reading reviews, I needed to come here.  My husband and I both ordered the small sizes.  I definitely think he could of ordered the larger and been more satisfied.  He ordered the taco which was yummy, but not something I would normally order.  Basically taco toppings on mac and cheese.  Lol.  I ordered the pulled pork one.  OMG!  Mac and cheese layered with pulled pork, crunchy onion strings and bbq sauce.  Definitely would order again.  We also ordered a Caesar salad. Typical salad but with plain macaroni noodles.  Everything severed in a cast iron skillet.  

Service/Pricing:  Guy who took our order was nice.  He also was the one who brought us our food. Prices not too bad.  

Location:  Lots of parking. 

Verdict: Coming back for sure!  We want to try the grilled sandwiches."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! MACS is so fantastic! I've only been here twice, but my goal is to try all the macs! The first time I went, I had the Chicken Bacon Ranch Mac which was good, but very rich and a little on the salty side so it was difficult for me to eat it all in one sitting. The second time I had the Popeye Mac and it was incredible. The non-salty spinach and mushrooms helped balance out the rich, cheesy sauce, making for the perfect mac which I am craving more of as I am writing this. 
They have so many other delicious-sounding macs on the menu though, like Cheeseburger Mac, Taco Mac, and Loaded Baked Potato Mac. They have something for everyone, even a plain Original Mac if you aren't feeling very adventurous. I can't wait to go back and try the rest!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Macs! I've been wanting to for quite a while now. 

I had the Mama's Mac - it is mac and cheese with cut-up fried hot dog pieces. The flavor is great. Nice and creamy mac and cheese, crispy top layer of cheese, and the hot dog pieces were perfect. It made me feel like a kid again eating my Kraft Mac and Cheese with an Oscar Mayer hot dog cut up in it - but a more grown version with rich high quality products. It was delicious! 

Now, the portion sizes are a bit strange to me. I got the larger of the two options, and it was around $9 dollars. The \"large\" is not very large at all. My coworker and I had lunch together and we both agreed the dished seemed small, especially for the price. The hot dog slices, as delicious as they were, were very slim. If you stacked them all together, I would bet it wouldn't even make a third of a full regular sized dog. Disappointing for sure. I can't imagine how tiny the small must be. We joked that it might come served in a shot glass ;)

It was good, yes, and a lot of their menu looked like fun, creative dishes, however I doubt I will be back any time soon."}

They have so many great choices to choose from, and so far they have all tasted great. One more thing I absolutely love is the presentation of the food, I enjoyed it the first time, and every time since."}
