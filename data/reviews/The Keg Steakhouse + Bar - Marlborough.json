{"text":"My husband and I had a bad experience with the receptionist. We were waiting in line with 2 other couples behind us. She approached couple #2 first and then couple #3 as if we were not even there. Then I stood infront of her to get her attention but she rather answered the phone first instead of acknowledging me. I can't help but feel discriminated. It was then that the manager noticed us and inquired about our reservation. We were still early though. The receptionist told us to go around the corner to take a seat and we found out all seats were full so we just stood and she just kept on passing by infront of us. We did not feel welcomed at all by her. Good thing the manager, Michelle and server, Cristina made up for her very bad service. We would have rated the restaurant with 1 star or less. Food was great too."}
{"text":"Great little lounge steakhouse. Dimly lit, makes for a great place to take someone special on a date::;;;))))"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered steak for take out last night. There was a 30 minute wait for a table so it was super busy and that usually drives down the food quality at some restaurants, our food was even done when they said it would be!  We ordered medium rare top sirloin the steak was still warm and the shrimp and scallops that came with were perfectly done.   I couldn't have asked for a better dine out experience. I wanted to say thank you. We have 2 kids and you made our rare date night experience perfect! :)"}
{"text":"Both times we have went there we have had really great service and they were fast. The only thing that i didn't like was the seating was a little crampt and i felt like i was sitting with a different family when we were at our table."}
{"text":"We come here once a year with our whole family as a treat. Everyone enjoyed their food except my grandma and she never wanted to complain but the manager took notice that she didnt eat anything on her plate and he asked her why and she explained why and he dealt with it so well. We were really pleased. All the food was delicious as usual. All our courses were out quickly and our 2 waitress' were very attentive & all the hostess' were friendly. We will be back next year."}
{"text":"The Keg never has never failed us yet. The hostess said a 40 minute wait ,but we were seated within 20 mins. Service was fantastic and very professonal as usual. The prime rib I had was one of the best I'd ever had the pleasure of devouring. Yummy yum yum! My wife had the grilled santa fe chicken. It was moist, delicious and piled high with yellow and red peppers. She gave it 2 thumbs up! The price was very reasonable for what you get.  I will keep going back just for the terrific prime rib."}
{"text":"The Keg is one of those \"casual fine dining\" chain restaurants that I absolutely despise. But you know what, it's the 2nd best place in town for steaks, after Ceasar's."}
{"text":"While I do enjoy restaurants that are not blindingly bright they seemed to take it too far. It was too dim in the restaurant for myself and my guest. I like to actually see what I am eating, without eye strain. The meals were great but for the price you pay you would expect a little more to come with them, rather than having to order a side of veggies if you want more than just meat on your plate. We got in for a late-lunch, early-dinner so the place was not busy, but that didn't stop our server from ignoring us and leaving us hanging quite a bit. At the end of our meal and after waiting for our bill for far too long, we went up to the front because we just wanted to pay and leave. We may try a different location in the future to give The Keg another chance."}
{"text":"Let's face it, it's the Keg. One pretty much has a good sense of what one is going to get. Alright steak that is probably a little over-priced, but there will be large portions. Not the best place in town, but convenient locations and decent service. This essentially describes the Fillet Mignon dinner I had here. Probably cheaper if I cooked it at home. Likely, there are places with better product. However, it was nearby and was satisfyingly stuffed full by the end of it.  The service was impeccable. They did forget to bring out our Crab, Parmesan and Dip starter. But gave it to us for free because of the mix up. Our waitress did a great job of handling the situation.    Found the washrooms and the restaurant clean, but couldn't tell for sure because of all the dim lights."}
{"text":"This Keg is where everything started for us a couple of years ago. We were here for vacation not knowing that we will one day move to Calgary.  If you are looking for a good steak you will find one at the Keg. The inside of all Keg restaurants is usually quite dark - they have blinds on the windows which are shut 24x7 - but this lets you forget that almost all of these restaurants are located on a huge and ugly parking lot.   The service has changed over the past eight years and is going up and down depending on the students working here. This is the downside of ever changing staff. Going here every other year we never met someone twice.  I still give 4 stars as this location has a special meaning for us and the food was great."}
{"text":"This Keg is consistently marginal at best. There last night, tables smeary, water(?) stains on the woodwork, old and grungy. I could have got past that but the the food was terrible. My wife had a seasonal special seafood salad that looked thrown together and so salty she could not eat it. My steak seafood combo was nearly inedible: steak tough and sinuey, seafood rubbery and very salty. The service was good...but when the efficient young waiter asked if our meals were okay, he just looked blank when we told him of the problems. maybe they are not empowered to rectify a situation? What is the root problem?? Immature inexperienced kitchen staff and management. Sorry Keg, but after 30 or so years of my faithful business....I guess it is time to move on."}
{"text":"After having a horrendous time over at the Barley Mill with a sub-par steak and a mediocre service I knew I wanted to have a re-do somewhere else. When the opportunity came to go have some steak I came to The Keg.  This Keg location I have been to for as long as it has been open, first with my parents and brother, then with my parents, brother and wife, and then with my parents, brother, his wife and his children. I've also gone to this place a few times with my friends as well so I'm frequent here.   I understand over the years the service has been up and down but I also understand as a human being I can make a choice as to what time and what day I eat at an establishment. I choose the times that I know the restaurant won't be so busy and days (if I can) where it won't be peaking with patrons.  This is a perfect date restaurant as the ambience inside is quite intimate with lowly lit lights, covered windows so you aren't staring out into less than pretty parking lots and whoever might be out there (not the best area in town).  The service is usually good, get seated fast and next thing you know your server introduces him/herself to you and the drinks are ordered. It is a few minutes before your drinks come but the great thing to remember is you're the customer, so, when the drinks come make sure you order right away OR ask if you can order while you order your drinks.  I usually order the Top Sirloin, 8 ounces of naturally grilled steak cooked to a medium rare state. This also comes complete with a Caesar Salad to start and vegetables to go with your steak at a small cost of $25.95 - together the perfect size to fill the insides of your stomach. My steak has always been made to how I like it to be where I find some other restaurants will lack.  I'm already sure I will be back sooner than later, getting hungry just writing about this place. ;-)"}
{"text":"So many choices in our city aptly named \"Cowtown\". If you are wanting a really good steak without the wait, go to Cattlebaron Steakhouse just a few miles away from The Keg instead of waiting for a place in line here. Although this place has the name brand recognition, the line-ups, high prices and servers who are new don't know the difference between a strip loin, a filet or a top sirloin. Awkward!  Don't get me wrong, I love the consistency of knowing that I can get a Caesar (drink) or Caesar Salad at the same meal. I also love The Keg toppings. I can do without the long unnecessary wait times and turnover of tables without personalized service.   I had gift certificates the past two times I have visited this establishment and will probably not be a paying customer in the future."}
{"text":"Friday night date night at the Keg in the NE. Arrived about 8pm, a cook with a dirty chef's coat complete with meat thermometer in side pocket was at the podium helping the hostesses with guest seating. (???) We chose to sit in the dining room, debris littered the floor around the tables. We seated next to a rowdy bunch of gals who looked and sounded like they were having their first alcoholic drink ever. Waitress finally came and it took awhile to get drinks, wine and beer. The music was loud and from the 70's... OK I am really trying hard to find something nice to say. Oh! The mushroom neptunes were good as an appy! We ordered our steaks and when they arrived I had to go find steak knives from another table as ours were missing. Our waitress seemed nice enough but was very flustered as the entire dining room seemed to be complaining about their entrees and drinks. We got our entrees and while we have had better at other Kegs, it was not bad enough to where the manager had to come by and comp our meal.   Ordered: Top sirloin classic meal (salad was split for us, overdressed) Sirloin topped with pecans and goat cheese (good value) LOVE twice baked potatoes  As always, we boxed up our leftovers, paid and quietly left.  We had wanted to try a Calgary Keg location we had not yet tried and this one was our night's pick but it will not be a future pick."}
{"text":"I don't eat red meat and I can't eat dairy, so The Keg is never my first choice of restaurant to eat in. But I was meeting my parents for dinner and this was their choice so I went along.  I had the Thai chicken dish. It was okay. I don't think it was up to the level it needed to be to justify the price but, other than value, I don't have much else to critique. However, my boyfriend ordered the spinach salad with chicken and it appeared to come without dressing. He asked for it without red onions but they were still on it. The chicken apparently tasted fishy - perhaps they cook both on the same grill? It was unpleasant, anyhow. And my sister asked for her caesar dressing on the side but it came globbed on the salad. And the food took forever to come out even though the restaurant wasn't that busy.  So, needless to say, for the price, this was a severely disappointing experience.   If I do choose to visit a Keg in the future, it won't be this location."}
{"text":"Excellent steak.. good service. A bit pricey but In my opinion a few extra bucks is a small price to pay for quality food. I observed a family with children get some very cool looking drink for the kids and they also appeared to enjoy environment so this is good for any group couples to families alike!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and i always had a great meal anda great time. Lived the 24oz prime rib. Too bad it closed."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location several times and have found that the Keg standard has just been deteriorating.   All four steak dishes came out over cooked, grissly, and way too much fat. We had to send them all back....  The service recovery was a nice gesture, replacing all of our meals not just the steaks but it's a little too late.  I will not be going back to this location as it seems to be the same story across more and more locations. Poor food comes out and then they try to recover. I want good food at the onset, not because it was so bad you had to pull out your recovery skills...."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken oscar, with garlic mash potatoes. It was delicious and full of flavor. Service was good, waitress attentive. Will come here again. Ample parking."}
{"text":"Ryan was friendly and efficient. He knew menu well, including the wine. We were looking forward to the awesome calamari sauce (sweet chili and garlic) we had at a Keg last year, but, unfortunately, it had changed 4 months ago :(  Should have asked Ryan first.  It's kind of sad we went all the way to Alberta and had a chain restaurant steak, but the local steakhouses I had found on Yelp were over our budget. The Keg is reliable that way... (but could have had that here...)  The side choice \"Twice-Baked Potato\" sounded interesting, but I didn't like it that much. (They carved out the middle of a baked potato, mashed it, and piped it back into the skin and baked it.) Garlic Mashed all the way!  The steaks were good as usual; I really can't rate steaks, since I rarely have some.  They don't take reservations on Friday and Saturday evenings."}
{"text":"Parking 5/5 lots of parking  Environment 5/5 was here at 6PM not to busy very cozy. Food 5/5 steak was cooked perfectly! Shrimp cocktail is the best! Service 4/5 server was too overly friendly, kept coming back every 5 mins and asking questions which interrupt our dinner."}
{"text":"this location is kinda slipping.....actually my hubby dont like it at all now, its crossed out in his list. after eating here, he lived in the washroom the rest of the night. he had the prime rib with au jus. what ever happened to them?"}
