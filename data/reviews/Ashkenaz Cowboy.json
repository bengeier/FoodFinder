{"text":"This place is great. From the second we walked in the door, we were well taken care of. It's a smaller place, so I thought seating myself, my husband, and the three kids wouldn't work, but they gladly moved tables around so we could eat in. We ordered burgers (one with \"cheese\"), a hot dog, chicken schnitzel on a bun, chicken fingers and fries, and four different sides. Everything was very reasonably priced (especially for kosher meat!) and super tasty. What was even better was how friendly and awesome the people running the place are. At the end of our meal, the kids all got cowboy hats, and got to try ringing the dinner bell - these things both went over really well with all three of them. I've been to lots of other kosher joints in the area, and this was by far the best bang for our buck. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Best  kosher BBQ in Toronto. Definitely worth the trip from all over Toronto."}
{"text":"Best food in Thornhill! Chuck and Gina hit a home run with this place. Great home made food with a nice spicy kick ( only if you wish) at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday with my youngest for lunch. Food was awesome as usual, chicken tenders we're very tender, fries we're good enough that my little one just hoovered them up.   My chili was great, sweet and spicy with enough meat and beans to give it great balance.   Total bill with a can of Coke was $21, can't beat that for kosher comfort food in Toronto."}
