{"text":"Fresh ingredients are a big plus,when it comes to bar. Bar is very high which is great if you need to be propped up. Bartender calls everyone my friend."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially in the summer. The patio is great. The servers were wonderful and friendly which made the experience a great one. They have great daily specials. The food was of great quality.. I would recommend their pastas and wings! The wait time could be improved for a better rating though."}
{"text":"I felt somewhat disrespected when I showed up for a few drinks. 3 of us were wearing blue jays jerseys after a game but we were turned away due to a dress code. Is anyone else aware of this\"dress code\"? It seems odd in port credit"}
{"text":"Roc n docs is a very lively local pub down in port credit. I've been going to this pub once a month for the past year to listen the live music. The bands that come are great, and enthusiastic. They for sure create a chill vibe to enjoy your pint with friends.  As for what the pub itself offers; the foods good. It's one of the better pubs I've eaten at. I have tried nearly everything on the menu, but my favourite is the wings special they have on Wednesdays. As for drinks, it's the same as a regular pub. They also have an upstairs, which I have yet to discover. I'll be checking that out the next time I'm here.  Overall, the service is good. The owner seems like a nice guy and the rest of the staff too. I for sure recommend this place for anyone looking to listen to live music in a fun environment. It's one of the better pubs at port credit."}
{"text":"I really like this place! There is a rooftop patio, small - so it gets full pretty quickly on nice days, but it's a friendly, fun atmosphere. The menu is quite affordable, and they have a couple of good beers on tap.The servers are nice and knowledgeable. There are daily specials (which are on their website), unfortunately not on the patio though, only downstairs. Bands play here quite often and it attracts an older crowd."}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon, this hidden away rooftop patio is a great place for a pint! Downstairs there is a nice bar area and a stage for music. Upstairs there are tables and a view of the street from the patio.  We ordered a beer or two and some eats. The poutine was smothered in thick gravy and I'm glad that we split it because it's huge!  The swiss mushroom burger hit the spot and served on a fresh toasty bun.  A great place for a bite while exploring Port Credit!"}
{"text":"Roc and Docs.. The pinnacle of Port Credit.   This restaurant has been here for years and has remained consistent.  The food is great. Very flavourful. I highly recommend the steak and eggs for dinner.   The service is excellent. It's a small place so there are not a lot of employees working there. However, they always manage to do a great job during busy times and slower times.   The location is key. It is located smack dab in the middle of port credit overlooking lakeshore road.  The whole vibe is great.   The most important part of this review is the music. Roc and docs has a live band playing almost every night of the week and they are all excellent. The bands cater to different age groups and provides for a fun time.   I would highly recommend going to roc and docs. Make sure you sit on the rooftop patio with a group of friends. GOOD TIMES"}
{"text":"When I was a wee lad back in the halcyon days of the 90s, I remember coming to Roc'n Doc's with my family, and seeing nothing but a haze of cigarette smoke that permeated the restaurant for a solid hour as I ate chicken fingers there.  How times have changed.  Roc's has definitely come up a lot over the years, and it's now a destination for people in the local area looking for good pub food and an interesting locale. Although it still feels a bit like a hole-in-the-wall bar, the experience in general is worth venturing out for.  I used to make this place a regular stop at the last company I worked with, and we'd always have meetings on the rooftop patio (which was built a few years back). There are very few places in the village with as good a view, and you can look out onto Lakeshore if you're sitting by the railing. There's even a full bar up there!  The food itself has always been dependable, and I've noticed that they've upped the quality of their dishes in recent years. Whether it's a standard gourmet burger or one of the steak options, rest assured that you'll always get generous portions that will leave you feeling satisfied.  Although the restaurant still carries the stigma of its dive bar past (walk in any day of the week and you're bound to run into one of the dozen barflies that frequent both this and Wingporium down the street), Johnny and the rest of the staff have done a stellar job setting this apart from other bars in the area. It doesn't get much riffraff at night, there are live bands playing virtually every night of the week, and their drink options are plentiful.  I recommend checking this out if you're in the neighborhood (though not at night if you're under 25, lol)."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that a series of kitchen closures along the Lakeshore strip last night would land us in this fun little Port Credit spot! What's more, this spot had a live band AND 1/2 price on their entire menu?!?!  Fate I tell you, folks, FATE!!!  After a Yelp event just down the street at Ten Restaurant & Wine Bar a group of yelpers and I were looking for a change of scenery for a couple of drinks and some quick snacks. After walking west on Lakeshore and finding spot after spot closed we happened upon Roc'n Docs!  They had a strict 25+ age restriction at the door and they nearly denied me (I'm 28 by the way) because my newly shaven baby face looked too young to enter (OK OK I admit it, I was kinda dressed like Dennis the Menace). Once we all got in (what a hassle), we found our way to the rear of the restaurant and took up seating where we could. As the band set up it was awesome to see this place was packed for a Sunday night!  RnD had an interesting vibe/look to it, it was almost like a dive bar where you go to see undiscovered bands before they get big mixed with really nice fixtures and decor. Bravo guys I really enjoyed the look of your place! My kinda jam!  Once at the bar we ordered a round of drinks, I found out that the entire menu with the exception of 2 items was on for 50% off! Amazing! My Buffalo CM amigo and I ordered the rib special which came in quick time and were blazing hot! The meat was tender and saucy! Were they the best ribs I've ever eaten? No. Were they good enough to make me come back. Yes.   Then the band started and while I didn't get their names I did enjoy their renditions of popular Bob Marley classics and others.   I can't wait to come back and if you're looking for live music and good food and drinks in Port Credit, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. The atmosphere is awesome and the rooftop patio is fantastic! I had a server named Holly and she was the best. Never had such good service in my life."}
{"text":"So we wanted to eat somewhere with a great view, and the sign in front of the place read something like 'come on in for a great view and eating in the sun' or something.  When we got to the top, there were only 3 tables with good views, all of which were taken, and the entire roomtop was covered by umbrellas.  We told our server we wanted to eat in the sun at least, however she seemed a bit overwhelmed as we later learned she was the only one for all the tables on the roof.  Best part of the dinner was the pasta deal, she got the crole pasta which was very tasty, and I got the pan seared fish which was mediocre.  They don't carry any moscato, which is her favorite, and I tried a few different beers not available in the US.  I think they overplay their rooftop bar, as we had higher expectations.  I would maybe skip the rooftop and look for place with outside seating on street level if outside eating is your thing (we enjoy it)."}
{"text":"Got to spend some quality time with the yelp gang and the cm.  Fate brought us in, Destiny kept us there.  At least that's what I think the name of the waitress was, when she told us food was 50 per cent off.    The house band was pretty good with a rash of Marley songs.  If you need booze, music and edible food.. this'll do.  This'll do."}
{"text":"Amazing food,  great band, nice bar,  and great service . A great spot to go for music and a bite to eat with friends,  and family."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their rooftop patio. Food and service were good. A little bit surprised at how high the bill was but we had a great time so it didn't really matter!"}
{"text":"I always passed this establishment walking through Port Credit but never stepped inside but I do wish I had sooner! There's a cute patio up top that looks out to Lakeshore and the inside opens up to a lifted stage, welcoming bar and lots of seating. Each time I've gone I had the Roc N Doc burger, which just tastes amazing! The staff, especially Lisa, is fantastic and I always have the best time listening to the Rebelljo band playing!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place with a patio and a decent menu in Port Credit and came across Roc n Docs. It was a beautiful day and the fact that their patio is rooftop, enticed me even more.  With the waterfront festival going on and the weather being so great, I was surprised that they weren't more busy on a Saturday afternoon. There were only 2 other couples on the patio when we got there.    My girlfriend and I both ordered a sangria and I ordered the honey garlic wings with fries and my girlfriend got the buffalo chicken wrap with fries. The wings were ok. The flavour wasn't anything outstanding. I would say even the wings at the hot table at Fortinos give more flavour. The fries looked better than they tasted. Think Swiss Chalet fries but thicker. The sangria was good and the fruits they used looked super fresh. Not frozen. I wish they added some mango or maybe some peaches. I think that would've made it perfect.   I'd come back for the patio and maybe try an appetizer like nachos or something. 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Nice place at lakeshore with nice servers. Patio is good. Can come everyday and sit at patio and relax. Food taste can me a bit better. Overall enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"Amazing BLUE CHEESE BURGER! DELICIOUS! My buddies ordered the rib's they wouldn't share because they said it was too good to pass some over. Next time I'm in port credit I will be giving this place another go.   So many pictures and reviews on this place, Im dying to go back. I can't comment on the service, that day we were so rushed it was a quick grab and go.  Its a relatively small place, reservations for more than 5 not recommended.    Parking is on the street as usual for downtown Port Credit."}
{"text":"Sat on rooftop, was pretty small and kind of private.  The tables were awful, almost bent upwards.  Had the buffalo chicken wrap and it was pretty good but the cheap cocktails are cheap for a reason, not the greatest drinks I'd say this is your average pub."}
{"text":"So I've been meaning to come here for years now and finally had a opportunity to come. This place has a fantastic patio that over looks the busy street and is perfect if you want to enjoy a warm night out with friends. The drinks were reasonable but the food was anything impressive.   I had the southwest chicken burger and it was bland despite all the sauce and flavoring that was added to the burger. the service was alright, I felt bad for the one guy running the whole patio since everything slowed down. (We waited quite a while to get out bills)  This is a great patio spot if you want to just enjoy a nice night out but I'd recommend you come for the view."}
{"text":"We came here on Halloween night due to the fact that they were having a halloween party, and that they were close by. Boy am I glad we did!  This place is a cozy bar/restaurant in Port Credit, close in proximity to everything. There isn't too much seating inside the restaurant, but in warmer weather they have a huge outsdoor deck.  They have live bands playing weekly, and a sports game always on the tube.  We got the nachos, which were HUMONGOUS! For $15 they easily filled my husband and I. Everyone in my group agreed that the food was delicious. My only complaint was the cost of the drinks, $9 for cider? Yikes!  Never the less, the service is great, friendly atmosphere with great music.  I can't wait to go back and explore more of their menu!   4/5"}
{"text":"Yikes.   Watch your bill, they overcharged us probably on more things than we caught.  The crowd here is... much older... Everyone here on a Thursday night was over 40, at least. So we definitely stood out as mid-late 20 year olds.  Pretty sure we weren't obnoxious or anything... The three of us wanted a drink to catch up and chill after work. We even ordered some nachos even though we weren't hungry, since our very short waiter looked like he was getting annoyed that we weren't spending as much as he'd like us to be. He was not very nice or welcoming.  The food was regular pub quality, I guess. Wasn't bad, but wasn't too great either. Deserves a 'meh' for sure.   Our third friend arrived late, so we ordered first before he came. Once we did, the waiter took all of the menus away, didn't offer for us to keep one, left before we could ask, and never gave them back to us.   When our bill arrived, I paid for it immediately because I usually don't check, but thought it was weird that our $16.99 nachos and $6 drinks would cost over $42 before tip, so I looked at the bill and they definitely overcharged us. I asked about one of the drinks and the waiter was like oops guess they charged you $9, lemme pay you back in cash. He gave me $2 back. I didn't get a chance to look at the other items, and he didn't give my receipt back so I don't even know how much they overcharged us on the other stuff.   Definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"The rooftop patio is nice but nothing special.   The server had her friend over with a dog but when we asked if we could bing our dog she said it was not allowed and that it was just her friend and her dog.   We were served after the 2 tables that were seated after us so the service was a bit slow and inconsistent.   We both had the signature burger which was really standard and i didn't even want to finish it."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for some sandwichs. I wouldnt have been so upset had I not seen people who were waited on after us get all their food. Also my fries were cold indicating that they were just sitting there in the kitchen. The view on the patio and the liquor is what made it 3 stars"}
{"text":"Had a great night here with some friends. The service was pretty good when we got there early for dinner because it wasn't that busy. Later on in the evening service was much slower. We came to see a friend that was performing on stage.  The acoustics were pretty good. The food was really good. They just happened to have a half price special on ribs and wings that night. Had a fun night roc'n at Doc's. There is also an outdoor patio upstairs."}
{"text":"$9 pasta Monday's - any pasta on the menu - full serving drunken shrimp and lobster reg $19.99 for $9 - amazing rooftop patio - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to go here and it was great. Sunday night everything on the menu is 25% off. They had a cute elderly man doing live music. The drink selection is good, and the food was above par for sure. I will be back. The atmosphere was homey and welcoming and clean."}
{"text":"Had the eggs Benedict here. The service was very friendly and the food was alright. Not the best ever but would definitely give it another try. I went in around noon on a weekday so was a bit on the quiet side Which I enjoyed. Would be back one day."}
{"text":"Decent service and mediocre food. Our waiter was friendly but she didn't do anything special, we had to call her over a few times. Our wings were a little on the dry side and flavourless. They were advertised as \"grilled wings\" so I was expecting char marks like the ones from the pump in clarkson but it was more of a crispy skin. My poutine was delicious! One of the best poutine sides I've ordered. Usually when you upgrade your poutine to a side the restaurant doesn't even use cheese curds but they do. I'd come back because they have great prices and I'm sure they have more to offer."}
{"text":"I am an avid fan and frequent goer of the Port Credit area.  All the bars/restaurants have a very small village feel with a lot of regulars frequenting the same spots.  I went to Roc n Docs on a nice sunny afternoon for a drink. Surprisingly, it was my first time there.  It has a great rooftop patio with a bar and music. On a nice summer day it's a great spot to catch some rays and a nice buzz!   I can't comment on food as I was strictly on a liquid diet...that liquid being vodka! Had a great martini (or two) and enjoyed the view of PC from the rooftop."}
