{"text":"my work gets this for lunch a lot and i love it! always tastes great! and never had any issues with our catering orders!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best bbq restaurants in the Phoenix area.  Awesome atmosphere, and good food."}
{"text":"Everything is simply amazing. All the meat is smoked until it is fall apart delicious. They take their time and it shows."}
{"text":"Food was good. I am not a big BBQ fan but this was good food. I will be back."}
{"text":"Best barbecue in valley. I grew up with the old Bobby Magee's and this an outstanding evolution. Heather was an outstanding server, funny, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I ordered the babyback ribs, and it was DELISH!!!  My husband and I split the meal, plenty for two or more.  The mashed potatoes are out of this world.  Another person in our party ordered the BBQ brisket sandwich and fries.  They Loved it all.  The atmosphere is fun.  Great place for a date night or for the entire family!   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bobby Q's three times since they have opened, and may I just say it is definitely  the most fantastic food I've ever had! The new smoked wings on the menu are one of THE best things I've ever tried. The smoke house burger is a definite MUST try when you go in! Make sure you order your food with a raspberry sangria, you will not be disappointed. I will definitely be going back! Thank you for the awesome service and best food!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place a couple of weeks ago at the recommendation from some friends of ours.  We have tried several BBQ places around town and while most are pretty decent there has not been anything \"special\" in my book.  Wow, this place was \"special\".  Typical atmosphere you would expect in a BBQ joint, but set up in a way that is not your typical noise level.  Nice.  The food was just over the top good.  A little expensive, but that's okay because I can honestly say I have never had BBQ in a restaurant this good.  Period.    We'll be back!"}
{"text":"\"This is not how we do business\" that is what I was told by not 1 but 2 managers. Really I had a very minor issue, but after all, Taylor came to our table to greet us and told us to tell him if we needed anything. They gave me respect, a very generous solution, and a good conversation. In the hospitality world that is how you \"do business\"  Bartender shakes hand, tells you about the menu-check. Great St. Louis ribs-check Great cornbread- check. Great atmosphere- check. Great baked beans- check. Bag of mini doughnuts on the way out!!! I'll be back for the pecan cole slaw soon!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bobby-q restaurant... the food and service was the best of the best. The brisket  and Mac & cheese was my favorite. Every staff member we interacted with was friendly, but our server Garrett was beyond amazing! He was very attentive, helpful, sweet, and kind... waiters like him are very rare. Hive five Garrett L. keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"A definitely must go restaurant when you are in the ASU/Phoenix area. Friendly and attentive staff, great ambience and one of the best BBQ's we ever had! They smoke their meats for 21 hours! A flavorful, falling off the bone Bbq!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for the first time and we loved it. The service was great, the food was also great and good portions. We had to wait for about 20 minutes but it was worth it. Definitely recommended it and will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork sandwich, the corn bread was incredible!  I was sold by the mini donuts when you walk in the door.  The Staff is very attentive and more then helpful. I will be back a lot!"}
{"text":"I've been so excited to try this restaurant since it opened and my experience was very pleasant. The food is great and our service was excellent. Our servers name was Anissa and she was so helpful and sweet. She gave us great recommendations of what to eat and asked my boyfriend and I our personal food preferences. She was so patient when we were so indecisive because everything sounded so good. Even when my son spilled his drink all over the floor she was so nice and had it taken care of immediately. Great service and great food goes a long way with me so we will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in for the first time tonight after making reservation at 7.45pm. we arrived around 7.40pm and got in really quick after that. Gio was the server assigned to our table and he was very pleasant. we ordered q rolls it was great. I ordered three meat combo, ribs, brisket and sausages, with Mac and cheese. My plate was soooo good the best I've had in a long while. My boyfriend got 12 oz steak medium cook, at first it came out undercooked for his liking. so we sent it back. they are really busy so it's understandable to me, who is in restaurant business. Their staffs came to table and sincerely appologized. that was very nice of them. They showed that they really care and take pride in what they do.good food and outstanding services, I'll definitely go back!!! good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time hanging with my buddy at Bobby Qs Mesa location at Stapley and US 60.  We both ordered the 12oz Wood Fired Top Sirloin Steaks with two sides - $24.50/ea - and they were absolutely worth every penny. The experience was incredible, unlike any other restaurant experience I've ever had, the atmosphere was incredible, the food, the smells, everything about it was amazing. The waitress Anissa was on point with taking orders (she didn't write anything down, it was impressive) and keeping up on the drink refills and making sure everything was perfect during the dining experience. The manager also stopped by as a friendly gesture and asked about the experience which made you feel valued.  I'm not going to spoil all the delicacies of the experience, but if you find yourself hungry and are near a Bobby Q's location, go to it, and be amazed. The Mesa location is incredibly detailed, and quite spacious. Highly recommend.  We also went over to their amazing bar lounge area after food, sat in some luxurious chairs and had a couple old fashioned whiskey drinks, along with a $5 pitcher of some majestic blueberry craft beer recommended by the bartender Chris. Chris also gave us a tour of the restaurant as well as showed us the inner workings of the kitchen and the outback smokers they use. Awesome experience (albeit a little pricey).  I meant to post this review on here awhile ago, my apologies, I went to Bobby Q's 1/12/17."}
{"text":"Amazing! You need to visit this restaurant if you like BBQ! We had the 3 meat platter with baby back ribs, prime brisket and rotisserie chicken, and it was to die for!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant.  I use them for catering also.  They are just the best in the valley.  If you haven't tried their Q-rolls, you are really missing something special!"}
{"text":"I had a steak. It was good. Not so good to where I give up Texas Roadhouse. The BBQ is the best I have ever had. It's just a little pricey."}
{"text":"Amazing service and really good food!!! So yummy, looks pricey but it's alot of food. And free mini donuts when you leave:)"}
{"text":"Bobby Q had the best bbque around!!  We like to split the three combo platter!  There is still plenty to take home after feeding two people & that helps with cost.  We LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome place.   Healthy portions.  Roman our server is best ever.   Keep it up.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Came in on Saturday night and had an hour half wait.  First piece of advice, make a reservation.  Ventured to the bar since helpful hostess adviced we could eat meal at the bar also. Discovered this whole land of couches, pillows, leather comfort chairs, mirrors, candle light and wood table tops.  Then found out from helpful bartenders that you can sit, order a meal with drinks and dine in this comfy couch area.  Amazing. Beer selection is great, Q-Rolls (oh my God!) and a menu item named Whole Hog in Heaven is about to have me miss meditation tonight.  If you use the check in coupon the manager will come by and say hello and make you feel uber welcomed.  So now I will finish my IPA and wait on this amazing leather chair for my complimentary doughnut dessert.  Please come check this spot out.  Honestly best BBQ experience ever... they had me at complimentary doughnut.  Cheers and enjoy a beautiful day!"}
{"text":"Our first dinning experianc was great! Our server was personable and very helpful. The food was exceptional and in large portions. Real deal BBQ! We tried fried chicken, brisket, ribs and pulled pork. Each piece of meat was perfection. Not to mention the BEST Mac & cheese. The atmosphere was classy and the restaurant was beautiful. Dress up or go super casual. We returned for dinner last night and loved our funny upbeat waiter. The food was still perfect and we never felt rushed. During both visits we were visited by upper management. We are telling family and friends they have to try Bobby Q's. We also found out the great pitcher beer prices on happy hour!"}
{"text":"If you have been to Bobby Q's before you know the food is GREAT and one thing I have missed since moving from Phoenix to Mesa is this delicious food, that's why I was so happy when I heard they were coming to Mesa and I feel my life is now complete.  The food excellent   The service very good for the first day open."}
{"text":"Garett and Ashley (the manager ) were great! Excellent fast service, even though the place was packed! Recently went to Whisky Row in Gilbert and paid the same price for half the quality of service and half the quality of food. If you want large portions of BBQ go here! Only thing I would recommend is trimming the trees in the parking lot, the branches hit your car slightly when parking and driving through."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place out yesterday. We were greeted with a bombardment of welcomes that was almost too much and obviously rehearsed. Kind of like going to Home depot where there's somebody around every corner asking if you need help finding something. Kind of nice and annoying at the same time. It was funny that a fellow in the restroom joked about expecting a greeting in the bathroom. Lol!  Besides all the hoopla and theatrics the service was excellent!  The deco and ambiance was nice for a BBQ place. This used to be RT O'Sullivan and McGrath's Fish house several years ago. They really transformed it nicely!  The food was really good!  I had the two meat combo with prime rib brisket and pulled pork along with grilled veggies and loaded baked potato. Wife had the prime rib brisket with corn and ranch beans.  The brisket was delicious and so tender that it almost melts in your mouth. The pork was also tender and tasty. The veggies were a little disappointing. They had a nice smoked flavor but kind of a small portions. The baked potato was huge! Corn bread was really good! Wish I had more though.  The beans my wife had were tasty and loaded with pork. Corn was okay.  This place is not cheap. Between the two of us with two beers and a soda came to $63 before tip.  It's nice to see this class of restaurant come to Mesa. Hopefully it will stick around for a long time!  I'll definitely be back! I want to try the steak next!"}
{"text":"The baby back ribs are so good! You honestly could not go wrong eating here. I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"We tried The bbq ribs, brisket, sausage and shrimp and paired it with vegetables, corn bread, mac & cheese (sides) all perfect. We had VIP treatment by manager Taylor and waiter Dimitri. Excellent drinks, food, atmosphere (loved music) and service. I highly recommend this restaurant/sports bar."}
{"text":"To be honest we mostly came here because the building on the outside looked super cool and it was a new restaurant in the area, but we'll definitely be coming back. Food was really good, the corn bread was fantastic and the free donuts they gave us on the way out was an awesome final touch to the experience."}
{"text":"Great night out with friends and good food. We were seated quickly and the drinks were refreshed regularly. I had the brisket and it was super tender as expected."}
{"text":"If your accustomed to good BBQ, you won't find it here. If you start with a larger size slab as they do, it needs to be cooked longer so the fat cooks off leaving firm tasty meat. I'm not saying the ribs were not cooked, just not long enough, leaving pink, fat saturated meat. Slimy. Maybe it's a style? Walnut coleslaw side sounded interesting, was disappointed to get some pretty regular coleslaw with a few nuts sprinkled on top. Not even creative enough to mix them in. Cornbread was good not near enough to carry the meal."}
{"text":"So, maybe it's taken me a little time to formulate this review, because I have mixed emotions about our visit here, all in all we'll be back because we believe in second chances.   We arrived on a Saturday late morning around 11am for a quick bite before a movie. We both love BBQ, and Bobby Q's is new so we figured what the heck. When we walked in the door we were initially quoted around an hour, remember when I said we arrived at 11am? We asked if there was bar seating and we were promptly seated at a high top. The server was very nice, but still learning the menu, no big deal. The bar was surprisingly empty for this long of a wait, but there were plenty of open table's and lots of TV's with the morning NCAA Football games on all over the place. Decent beer selection, and full bar, they even have hard cider.   Back to the menu, we both settled on meals and ordered. My wife ordered the brisket sandwich and I ordered the Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich. This is where things took a wrong turn, except for the cornbread, the cornbread was on point. The brisket sandwich arrived and then was promptly removed, the server said it was the wrong entree, but there seemed to be some confusion between the staff as to if it was right or not. They finally came to a conclusion that it was wrong, and delivered a new one, claiming that it was the right entree, well, even lean brisket is supposed to be moist. This was far from it, it seemed as though it had been cut 20 or 30 minutes before and held under a heat lamp until it was plated. It didn't even look like it was cut from the brisket.   My pulled pork arrived and the pork was also very dry, like, it had been pulled 2 days ago and held in a steam table dry. Our server asked how my sandwich was and I told her it was very dry, not even the coleslaw could rescue it. She went to the kitchen to check on the pork and came back with a menu asking what else I might want, I ordered a chicken quesadilla. The manager happened by around this time and asked how things were, we preceded to explain the situation and he promptly started making amends. He agreed that the pork looked very dry and also went back to the kitchen to find out what was going on. He came back with a deconstructed pulled pork sandwich. The pork was very moist and tender, pretty much like it was supposed to be. I tried to cancel the quesadilla and just go with the new pork, but they brought it out anyway. That was really good, to bad I was just to full by then to really enjoy it.   The manager comped out our entire bill, including the 2 beers we had, he also came back with a $50 gift certificate. We told him that we were not expecting anything, including the comp, that we're both very familiar with the restaurant industry and are not looking for a 'free meal'. He told us that he just wanted us to come back and give them a second chance. We'll definitely return, it's not that the food was bad, it was disappointing, but quick attempts were made to remedy the situation. The manager genuinely cared about us and wanted the return service. This is something that one does not see very often anymore in the service industry. Kudos to the manager, we hope to see you when we return."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town!!! Atmosphere is great, location is good, right off the 60. Service was good, but the food is amazing!! Best wings ever!! Amazing appetizers and entrees! Must try if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Came tonight for the first time with the Wifey.It was our 7 year anniversary and knew she loves barbecue so wanted to give this place a chance.  We were greeted by 2 nice Young ladies that quickly found us a spot and took us to our table.After a couple minutes our server  showed up and introduced herself(not all servers do so I liked that).Irma then asked us if it was our first time so she could give us s brief history about the place and the techniques used for cooking.After that we started look a the menu (very hard to decide due to the variety) and started with the artichoke spinach queso dip that was delicious along with  a red and green homemade salsa that as an expert in the field(born and raised in Mexico lol) was left very impressed with the flavor and texture.From the cocktail menu I got the coconut mojito that has the perfect balance between flavor and liquor (not  to sweet and not tasting like a virgin piña colada ). For the main course  had to try the ribs so ordered the 2 ribs plate witha baked potato and grilled veggies.My Wife got the jumbo potato with pulled pork and she loved it!!!.Did I mentioned that our food was on our table after 15 minutes or ordering it? Insanely fast!.Portions are so huge that barely finished half of my plate.Overall we have a great experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely Phenomenal...food, atmosphere, hostesses, wait staff...top notch all the way around.   Prompt to seat us and check back to make sure our needs were met.  Management stopped by which was nice.  Best burger!  Ribs outstanding.  See you again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food-we had filet, pulled pork, ribs and the burger. Flavorful, tender, awesome! Sides were just as good. Bar staff was attentive and helpful. Thank you, William. Dining room staff was very good. Couple small glitches, but for day 4 since they opened, but really quite good. Met the owner, that added to the experience! Cool, comfortable vibe. Can't wait to return in a couple weeks!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and very nice servers. The brisket is amazing and the robes is a must. One of my favorite places for BBQ!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. The cornbread and donuts were a bonus!  I had the chicken platter with the pecan coleslaw (yum) and it was very good. Also had the jalapeño margarita and I'd save my money on that next time!  Very bland and by he time I finished drinking the glass was still full of ice!  Not that I like a lot of tequila in my drink but I'd like to know they at least put it in there!"}
{"text":"I had one weekend in Arizona and I wanted to try some BBQ. This place came highly recommended by the internet (although, they may have been referring to the original spot in PHX). I'm not a BBQ connoisseur, but I know enough and I honestly didn't feel this place performed.  There was 6 of us, mid day on a Sunday. We had a young guy server and he did a great job through the entire meal. Credit to him.  I'm only going to review my meal. 3 Meat Combo, St. Louis Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork. Sides of Mac & Cheese and Coleslaw.  Forewarning, If you like a lot of sauce then disregard. I believe sauce should be just a side to add to the meat, that the way to tell how well meat is cooked is on its own.  The ribs were good. Tender and meaty. Some ribs took the perfectly cooked tug to get meat off, and other ribs the whole meat just fell off with one bite. Little taste of smoke. Sauced heavy. The brisket was disappointing. It was almost like pot roast covered in BBQ sauce. I'm guessing it was reheated from the previous nights service. No evidence of a smoke ring and all you could taste was the sauce. No good. The pulled pork was average. It looked like it was cooked in a crock pot or oven. No bark or taste of smoke and once again, covered in sauce.  Mac and cheese was cheesy and still hot by the time I got around to it. I really enjoyed the coleslaw and the corn bread was excellent. The doughnuts at the end of the meal were the best thing we all had that day.  Cocktails were pretty good. Food was on the higher priced end but portions were huge.   I recognize how well this place and the original establishment has done with its reputation and reviews. That's why we went.  Maybe i'm there on a bad day? But all we got was over sauced, under smoked meat."}
{"text":"Nice environment and great food but you'll walk out of the restaurant smelling like a deep fryer. I had to go home and shower before I continued on with my night."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! We ate the whole hog! Ribs chicken brisket delicous dessert .yummy, everything made from scratch on premises"}
{"text":"Always awesome food and service!   Favorites are lunch specials that include the salad!  Woot Woot! The brisket melts in your mouth like buttah. The pulled BBQ chicken, Pork, Sirloin Steak, and ribs are Yummy too!  We have not met a server yet that was not nice and wanted to deliver the best to us.  Oh did I mention the freshly made corn bread and mini donuts."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Ice cold beer and delicious  ribs. I came here with my family after an Angels spring training game. The mesa location is only 15 mibutes away from the stadium. We got our food in less than 15 minutes. Amazing experience... we will be back."}
{"text":"the place on i17 is great but i love this place!  Great food,  marvelous servers!!!! It just opened here on Monday,  Oct 3rd but it is already my go to place for happy hour and food. I will be bringing work folks here especially those I want to impress.  It's that good,!!"}
{"text":"Our son fell asleep in the car on the way to the restaurant. They sat us at a table that had one more seat than was in our party and were really opposed to putting us in a booth as they only seat 4. We were 6.   Management intervened and really made our meal amazing. They really turned what could have been a crappy experience into a great one. We'll be back. And the food is really great too."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The wait was a longer than we were advised when we checked in by a sizable amount. Normally I'm used to them overstating the wait time to temper your expectations so I was surprised when we had to wait and wait and wait. With that being said, the wait was worth it. We had the onion appetizer (not sure the name but it was a giant block of fried onions) and a pulled pork sandwich. The food was great, I want to try the ribs next time."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My family loves going to Lucille's BBQ, but this place gave Lucille's a run for their money. The brisket was probably my favorite! They had really great sides too. You definitely need to try their sweet potato fries. Oh! And you get donuts after. YUM!"}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of this place until the last time I visited. The food is overpriced and the donuts were stale. Service is horrible."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about this restaurant. Their staff was phenomenal, the food was amazing and the overall ambience was spectacular! These guys went above and beyond for my party, I could go on and on but I highly recommend Bobby Q's for events, for date night or simply for an amazing meal served by delightful people."}
{"text":"Awesome draft beer selection.  Food was on spot.  Had the two meat combo split... way enough food for two. Loved the hostesses so friendly. Showed us around to the different kinds of seating.  Love this place."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Been there three times already.  We have had the brisket, St Louis and baby back ribs, pulled pork, smoked prime rib, roasted corn, mac and cheese, and fries.  For me, the stars were the brisket, the pulled pork, the prime rib and the corn.  The brisket and pulled pork are some of the best BBQ I've had.  The corn is served off the cob in butter. So delish.  But the best thing I've had so far, by far is that smoked prime rib.  It's not too fatty and the smoke flavor is wonderful.  Not too strong... just right.  Each meal comes with pre dinner cornbread muffin tops and post dinner mini cinnamon sugar donuts!  This place is a little pricey but if you come at happy hour you save lots on drinks and meals are big enough to share.  The place itself is really nice too.  They have two outdoor patios, a nice inside restaurant area, a fantastic bar area with a few TVs, and a social area with couches and coffee tables.  I can hardly wait to go back and get that prime rib.  Mmmmmmmmmm....."}
{"text":"Should be rename the greasy spoon The food was terrible  Service a+ I high really high hopes for this place it has a really cool vibe Great bar"}
{"text":"Great  happy hour menu,  great atmosphere,  great bar b que  and great service!   The place is clean and smells delicious as you are walking in."}
{"text":"I love this place, I could eat here everyday, I take my family here all the time, the ribs, chicken and Mac and cheese are to die for, the sweet corn bread, everything's always perfect, they give you more then enough food, they have baked potatoes that look so good, I get it every time I go but I'm never able to get to it because I'm stuffed bout time I get to it lol"}
{"text":"The best BBQ in town. Didn't realize they had this location. Extremely glad we found it. It's better than the Glendale location. They did a great job accommodating our party of 9. Left stuffed as usual. Try the Q-rolls, they are to die for."}
{"text":"Great ribs!!!!! To die for corn bread.  Courteous staff.  Will come back. We had so much food, we will have leftovers.  My husband had the Filet Mignon and it was delicious.  I really liked the social area. This place would be a great area to host a party or to entertain a large group."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! My husband and I are new to Arizona - so new we don't have a house yet so just getting to know the area a little at a time. We found this gem across the street from AMC.  All I can say is WOW!! We shared an onion block appetizer that was just great. The BBQ my husband had and my loaded baked potato was superb! Even my drink I ordered- a mudslide wasn't on the menu but they made a great one for me Our server Aislynn definitely is the best so hope we see her our next visit. Thanks BobbyQ for giving us such a great date night"}
{"text":"I have to agree with David's review. I travel a lot and try to seek out good bbq wherever I go. This is not good bbq. Good St. Louis spare ribs are firm with spice, not slimy and undercooked, masked with bbq sauce.   Why do my baked beans have shredded pork in them? Why does my cole slaw have pecans on top? Why does my corn bread resemble circular hash browns?   I'm confused about all the glowing reviews."}
{"text":"Yum!!! We went for the first time and had the ribs and they truly were fall-off-the-bone delicious! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a tasty and satisfying dinner at Bobby-Q! The wait was a little longer than I would have been happy to do with kids but seeing as it was date night, it wasn't too bad. I love to look and outside of the restaurant. The garden is beautiful!  We had a good waiter who was friendly and did a great job taking care of us. He gave us some recommendations of what to order and we were not disappointed. We got the onion straw brick Ana a appetizer and it was delish! Also enjoyed my pulled pork sandwich! Definitely would recommend and go again...maybe at a less busy time though:)"}
{"text":"I live 5 mins away and a lot has changed in a few months. The used to have late night happy hour which was great. They eliminated that. Now I find out that the wings were taken off their HH menu. Thanks but no thanks!  **Updated** Sure I'll give you another chance if you bring back HH wings and late night HH"}
{"text":"Never been, but drove past it and great name. Made me laugh definetely deserves a 5 star"}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue restaurant that I've tried here in Arizona. Everything we've tried has been amazing. I loved the pulled pork, the ribs, the cornbread the drinks, the mac and cheese lol the list goes on. It's hard to find truly good bbq and I'm so glad there is finally an awesome bbq restaurant near me when I'm craving some yummy comfort food. I just try not to eat too much during the day if I know I'm going here so I can pig out!"}
{"text":"Based on all the early 4/5 star reviews, we decided to drive 20 miles to check this place out.  While the service from Gio was excellent, the food was mediocre at best.  We tried the baby back ribs, Q-lina pork sandwich and southern fried chicken and cannot, in all good conscience, recommend any of them.  The fried chicken was especially disappointing, flattened out and battered like chicken fried chicken.  This place feels like it wants to be Lucille's (Tempe) but it falls miserably short of that southern standard.  Excellent service isn't enough for us to forgive such mediocre and overpriced food, so we're done with Bobby Q."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Great service, was seated quickly. Smaller menu which is ok, to many choices are sometimes bad. The food was out fast and hot, full of flavor! I would recommend this place to any I know. I will be a repeat customer100%"}
{"text":"Every time I go in for lunch I tell myself to try something different, but I can't help myself. The Brisket Sandwich is sooooo good. Cooked perfectly, perfect consistency (not fatty) and a lot of food. I'm glad I have to drive out of my way to eat here because I would so over-indulge if it was closer. This time I went in on a Monday for lunch and the wait staff was quick and friendly as always. The manager came by to ask about our meal with a very personable tone - no token inquiry, she genuinely wanted to know! Love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drink choices. Great bar staff (that's the only place we've eaten). A bit $$ but good for a now and then dinner out."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of baby back ribs in my life, but these are possibly my favorite. The beef ribs are a little too fatty for my taste, but the flavor was good. Loved the donuts they sent home with us, and the corn bread was great too. Overall, a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Average barbecue at inflated prices.  Classy atmosphere for a BBQ place.  Service was friendly, but my order came out with the wrong side dish.  This was quickly corrected.  The chopped pecans on the cole slaw added a nice flavor and crunch.  The cornbread was good but didn't measure up to the cornbread at Z'Tejas.  The brisket sandwich had a generous portion of meat, very little sauce, and a bun that was not up to the task.  Had to eat the sandwich with a knife and fork.  I enjoyed my meal at Bobby Q, but there is better, cheaper barbecue to be had elsewhere in the Valley."}
{"text":"Everything you could have wanted and more. First time in the Phoenix area and followed the yelp reviews to this place. We were not disappointed. The wings, pulled pork and ribs were some of the best we've ever had. The drinks were fantastic as was the service. It's clear the management is really active on the floor too - which is nice to see.   To reviewers complaining about the price - it's kind of ridiculous. We had an appetizer, two huge plates of ribs and pulled pork and 4 drinks for $80. Really good value for your money. If you're complaining about paying the employees a living wage and reducing your tip because of it, just stay the hell home."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ that won't break the bank!  There's nothing I haven't liked in the times I've eaten here.  From the cornbread appetizers to the main course to the bag of mini donuts on the way out the door, this is a great place for larger gatherings or just a night out.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after reading the yelp reviews. So, I get there and it's pretty packed, for a busy Friday night I'm seated pretty quick, I had to wait about 15 min. So my partner and I are seated and we're going over the menu waiting for someone to come by and ask us what we want to drink..... couple min go by... 5 min go by... 10 min go by and still no one. So at this point we're about to leave then a waitress comes over and offers us a free appetizer since we had to wait so long. Ok cool, so we order and our food comes out pretty fast. But my partner needed a refill and we had to wait about 10 min for it and we had to ask another waiter. We also got boxes from another waiter because our waitress was no where to be found. She finally comes by to give us the check and then she leaves again for another 10 min... we had to wait another 10 min for her to bring us change... overall I'd just say should work a bit on speed. Food was tasty but made me sick. A lot of other people seem to enjoy it but, personally I wouldn't go back. Oh and it's OVERPRICED"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but the prices here do not support the quality of the food. The service was mediocre at best. Won't return."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome waitstaff. Came for lunch Tuesday 10/11/16 no wait. Very nice interior, open friendly environment. Will definitely be back. This is a must try!!!!! Omg Marissa just gave meto go donuts! Yummy!!!!! Thanks Marissa for the great service!!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ in a cool atmosphere.  The staff is very friendly and an overall well ran restaurant.  Great addition to the Mesa/Gilbert area. Some of the best baby back ribs you will ever have!"}
{"text":"One of the places we were looking forward to on our trip to Arizona. We had been here before. Arrived at 745 on a Saturday night, told wait was about 30 minutes for 6 of us. We were seated in about twenty. Our server, Heather was great with us, helped us out with one gluten free and one peanut allergy. She was prompt and attentive and went well beyond her call of duty. The only drawback was the brisket seemed a little tougher than other brisket. Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been satisfied with food, service and ambience all in the same place. But this place has nailed it! Even with the new opening they were still quick and friendly.  And the food....??large portions and meat so tender it falls off the bone. The donuts at the end are a perfect touch. Good job!! We will definitely be back and recommending to family and friends!!"}
{"text":"Went with family after a wedding that the bride suggested. What good food. I did not have the BBQ because I am from the south and did not want to be disappointed. I did have the Sirloin and it was amazing. My husband had a burger and loved it. The sides are huge and my mac and cheese was awesome."}
{"text":"My family and I love to eat at the one in Phoenix.  I was so excited when the location in Mesa opened up. Since we live in Chandler.  We visited the BBQ festival in Chandler.  I honestly think they should have won for the best BBQ. The Q rolls are amazing!"}
{"text":"The food here was just as good as the Bobby Q's Biltmore. Our server forgot a couple of things but it was a fairly busy time when we were there and things happen when servers are busy so that can be easily overlooked. Bobby Q ribs are consistently good as is the brisket. I'll continue to go to both locations because the food is really THAT good!!"}
{"text":"Though reading the good reviews on Yelp we decided with anticipation to try this place.  Sunday night so not crowded.  Service was good but the food was a complete disappointment.  Our son got the brisket sandwich but the coleslaw was dry and had a few pecan pieces sprinkled on top.  I had the 'jumbo baked potato' with chicken and what I got was about a 4\" long regular baked potato with maybe 2 ounces of chicken on it.  It was good but for $13 I should have gotten two of them at least or a potato like they serve at Joe's in Gilbert (what I was expecting and with 4 oz of meat is $11).  Wife got the catfish and ate only one piece because she thought it tasted funny.  She had potato salad as a side - large scoop but it had no flavor at all.  They gave us mini donuts at the end.  I did not have one but both son and wife said they were a bit under cooked. The cornbread given as an appetizer was the best thing we ate. No drinks and the bill minus tip was $52.00.  Anyway about an hour after we got home my wife vomited - she was fine all day so we think the catfish was spoiled.  HIGH PRICED - BAD FOOD - SMALL PORTIONS - VERY DISAPOINTING.  We will not be back...."}
{"text":"I've been to Bobby-Q maybe 5 or 6 times since they opened in Phoenix and it's always been an excellent experience. The food is great, the service is very good, and it's a very comfortable atmosphere. If you go during peak times, there may be a significant wait time and I don't remember if they take reservations or call-aheads. If you want Prime Rib, try to go earlier because they might run out. Cocktails aren't really my thing, but they do have a full bar. I've only been to the Mesa location once for a late lunch, but the food was just as good as the original Phoenix location. If you want really good BBQ with a more upscale atmosphere, Bobby-Q is the place to go."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and energy were great. The service too. However for me, the food was just average for the price."}
{"text":"serviced sucked food way over priced had prime rib $33.00 nothing special, had party of 4, wife had chicken gain nothing special food was mediocre  go across street to Texas roadhouse 1/2 the cost better food will never come back again"}
{"text":"Let me start by what was good. Atmosphere was spot on. Service was excellent. Corn bread was possibly the best I have ever had. The donuts at the end was a nice touch. Now on to the meal. I got the 2 meat plate. The pulled pork and brisket. Brisket was moist and good flavor not a lot of smoke but very fatty. Pulled pork was also moist but extremely salty finish. Regular BBQ sauce was good. Spicy sauce was not at all spicy. My daughter had the Mac and cheese it was very rich but good.  I give the service and atmosphere  5 and the food a 3."}
{"text":"The food was great. Service was also amazing. Friendly and caring staff. Awesome atmosphere. Demetrie (waiter) was absolutely fabulous."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The staff is great and the food is amazing! The free corn bread and donuts are huge plus! My favorites are the BBQ burger and the shredded BBQ pork."}
{"text":"We had a reservation here for Father's Day Dinner tonight and had a part of 6. We were happy with the fact we were seated right away even though all of our party hadn't arrived yet. Many places won't do that. The wait was pretty long for our food but it was ok due to being so busy due to Father's Day. The food was def worth the wait! I had boneless fried chicken which came with gravy on top and mashed potatoes & gravy and a side. Mashed potatoes were some of the best I've had! It might be because I hadn't really eaten carbs all week so I was indulging today, ha. The Q Roll appetizer was also a hit. Our parents had ribeye and it was cooked to just as they specified. Perfect Father's Day choice! Oops, almost forgot the best thing at the end- the homemade donuts, which are made in the front and served warm and fresh."}
{"text":"Omg!! New bar b que place for sure  Beats EVERY OTHER place in town. GREAT service. GREAT food! Kind of on the pricier side but worth every single penny. Great atmosphere too"}
{"text":"Awesome place for dinner and drinks. This place is a must for anyone visiting Phoenix. The place is decorated very neat. Be sure to make reservations or you will even have to wait on a week night. Leave room for the free donuts."}
{"text":"Friendly the moment we walked through the door and so was the aroma of BBQ!!   Really cool atmosphere and the food was so good.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm 50/50 on this one, but wasn't all too impressed. Service was great, everyone was super friendly and helpful! The ambience was super relaxing too, we sat outside on their beautiful patio! The food on the other hand was pretty overpriced. I have had just as good or better BBQ elsewhere for half of what you will pay at Bobby Q. However the donuts at the end were a huge bonus :)"}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in town. The one off the 17 is amazing too but this location is very nice, so glad I live close by! I swear I always fill up on corn bread before I even order because it's so amazing. I'm not really a meat eater so I just pick off my boyfriends plate and get Mac and cheese! The Mac and cheese is so Rich and creamy honestly 4 bites and I'm full. I was disappointed with the Caesar salad, but honestly who expects a good salad at a bbq place. Don't eat too much for dinner here to save room for the freshly fried donuts. I always burn my mouth, and never regret it."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and love the food. This time was different. We sat at the bar thinking we'd get faster service, but we were so wrong. The bartenders were slower than the servers. It took about 25 min tires for the bartender to come check on us when we were already done and had our cards out to pay. I wish this service experience wasn't so bad because we really would like to come back. Because of how we were treated as ghosts at the bar, we will not be returning. Maybe it was the bartender who looked like he was high that made our experience so awful. We will miss you Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here and I am disappointed that we didn't come here sooner! The service was excellent and the food was great! The mac and cheese was so good, 5 cheeses and that's all I need to say. The rib meat was falling off the bone and the brisket was smoked to perfection. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"My daughter heard Bobby Q had the best lemonade and I love BBQ so we thought we would give it a try for lunch.  Parking lot was packed so expected to wait for a table, but they got us right in.  Hostess and waiter were both friendly and our drink order was handled quickly.  Lemonade lived up to the hype!  We both had the pork sandwich and shoestring fries and they were excellent.  Also liked the pre-meal cornbread and the bag of little donuts they gave us.  The manager (lady with blue vest and blonde hair) was a rockstar as I could see her constantly working the room and making sure customers were taken care of."}
{"text":"Never a let down. Best BBQ baby-backs fantastic corn bread muffins. Great atmosphere.   Great for small and large groups.    Oh and let's not forget the drinks!!"}
{"text":"I was craving some serious bbq. I feel like Los Angeles kinda lacks in the bbq game. So grubbing on some bbq meats was on my Arizona to-do list.  Apparently, Bobby Q is No. 1 for bbq in AZ and No. 18 countrywide. I'm not sure if that's accurate, but whatever you say.  My friend and I shared the three meat combo. We got brisket, baby back ribs, link sausages with mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. Our food came with corn bread as well.  First off, the corn bread was dang good. Buttery, sweet, corny... yum  The meats. The sausage was good. The ribs were great. The brisket was fantastic. Tender, melt-in-your-mouth brisket is my second favorite type of meat. Bobby Q did not disappoint. The brisket was falling apart as I picked it up with my fork. The bbq sauces were all delicious as well. Perfect balance of sweet and smokey.  The sides were great. Can't go wrong with mashed potatoes and mac n cheese.  I haven't had much opportunity to try the best bbq places in the US, but this was a pretty good start."}
{"text":"Yum! Bobby Q was a fantastic dinner spot. My favorite part was the cornbread, so good! We ate in one of the beautiful outdoor areas and really enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was delicious, steak was cooked to perfection and all of the sides were tasty too! The sweetest surprise was a fresh hot bag of donut holes at the end of our meal!"}
{"text":"I doubt I would come back here.  Though the service was rather slow, they were all nice and friendly.  Atmosphere waa easy going and welcoming, but the food was mediocre.  The cornbread was kind of dry, as was the brisket sandwich that I ordered. I typically don't like putting much sauce on my bbq so that I can e not the smokey taste and flavors of the meat, but I had to put a ton of sauce on the brisket.  My wife's burger was juicy, but really didn't have any flavor to meat.  I did, however,  enjoy the mac and cheese. The calamari was ok,  but nothing impressive. Overall, really not worth the money spent."}
{"text":"Too bad our server said he was on his last week there, Chandler. He was amazing and extremely attentive. He suggested menu items and followed through with anything we asked- truly a pleasant server and does his job well.  This was our first time at this location but it was just as good as the other location. We come to Bobby Q's every spring training and I tell all of my friends and family that this is the best BBQ spot in the West.  I love the Hogs Breath platter and finishing it off with those amazing donuts. I always order too much and leave very full but the second best part about this food is that it makes fantastic left overs!"}
{"text":"Yelp says open til 2am, website says open until 2am. Tried calling a few times to check if kitchen was open late and could never get an answer. Showed up, kitchen closed."}
{"text":"This is BBQ heaven!!!! Go go go  Don't even look at the reviews Just go Just do it  It's amaziiiiiiiing The cornbread  The ribs  The burgers  Just grab your car keys and go!!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic from the time you walked in everyone was wonderful! The food was incredible, the waiter was helpful... can not say one bad thing!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I have had anywhere including Texas and Kansas City. The food is just as good at the Mesa location as it was at the Phoenix location. The service is on point with the general manager Donny walking around checking in with customers and a very attentive server in Taylor. Try the barbecue chicken, the brisket, pulled pork or pulled chicken you can't go wrong. The mac and cheese is the creamiest and cheesiest I have ever had  it is to die for. The prices might seem a little high but a 3 meat combo easily fed myself and my wife with leftovers to spare. We even had them cater our wedding reception and the food was amazing. Literally people could not get enough-- that being said, one recommendation would be if you cater to ensure you control portions so you don't run out of food too quickly. We had a lot of big guys who ate more than a fair portion of their food and we ended up running low on food towards the end of the reception.... we had to call in and get more food delivered. Not ideal but we dealt with it. This place puts Famous Dave's , Lucille's etc to shame."}
{"text":"$30 plus tax and tip for  4 scrawny beef ribs that were average. Lean yes, but only a few bites per rib. Flemings Bobby Q is not. Will not return. Value of the 4 ribs and 2 average sides is closer to $15.99.   Thank you for the well thought out reply from Bobby Q. If I read it correctly, the message is we charge what we get away with. Until business slows, no changes will happen. I believe in the free market and people are paying it, so i cant blame them for taking advantage.  But i will never go back, even if the price ever comes down to match the product."}
{"text":"Awesome food, will definitely be back! The cornbread is delicious, the brisket baked potato is to die for! The plates are very generous in size."}
{"text":"great tasting BBQ. a little pricey but it is hard to find true fall off the bone ribs. so delicious!"}
{"text":"4/26/18: Updated review Finally went back and was so expecting the same wonderful food. We were sadly disappointed. We visited at around 11:30am on a Sunday, shortly after opening.  1. Waitress came to take our order. I guess she thought we were not ready and walked away mid-conversation without saying she would be right back. My boyfriend was talking to her with his head int he menu. When he looked up, she was gone. 2. Food was subpar.  Coleslaw had no flavor (and I remember this being delicious the last time.) All I could taste were the pecans. It was nice and crunchy, not doused in dressing, but absolutely flavorless. Ribs were not falling off the bone like normal and had a weird flavor. At first we thought it was the smoke, but soon realized it tasted like burnt plastic. Maybe from the oven?  Pulled pork was ok, nothing special. Cornbread was probably the best part of the meal. Kind of sad to go out and eat Sunday lunch for $40 + tip and be highly disappointed. Probably wouldn't go back, not worth the money for less than mediocre food.    4/2017 Delish!  Our family dined here on a Friday night. We had driven by on the freeway and wanted to check it out. The building and the decor are really fantastic. Loved all the little details for industrial touches in the restaurant. There was a bit of a wait. My husband and I grabbed a beer and sat at the front entrance, which apparently we walked in through the take-out entrance. Someone escorted us to the front and got us a beeper. We watched the machine make fresh donuts, which you get with your bill as a dessert on the way out. They were fresh, hot, and delicious. But, I'm getting ahead of myself.... Dinner was superb. Truly good BBQ. We've been going to Joe's for years and wanted to try something new. I had a pulled pork sandwich, my husband ordered a meat plate (pulled pork and brisket), and my son order kids ribs.  The flavor was good and we were impressed. Kids ribs were a little on the fatty side, so my son made me pick the meat off and separate the fat.  We would definitely go back. It's not as casual as Joe's, where you eat at picnic tables. Definitely for a nice night out, and you will be spending $$$ more for the nice night out. We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed being out there as the weather was beautiful. Some of the seating is close to other diners. It didn't bother us, but I wouldn't want to be on a date and dining right next to strangers. With kids.  Waitress was awesome too. Was able to answer all of our questions and gave wonderful service, especially on a busy night. I think she even mentioned she was working a long, 12 hour shift.  Great BBQ  Beautiful restaurant  Delish donuts  Expect to pay a little more for a meal out"}
{"text":"Met some friends for dinner last week, while we were down in AZ for spring training and saw the reviews for Bobby Q and I was craving BBQ.  We didn't have a reservation, but we walked-up and they said they'd have a table for us within 15 minutes.  That worked fine, since our friends weren't going to be there for 15 - 20 minutes anyways.    We were seated once our friends arrived and were greeted by some of the friendliest staff I've ever met.  Our server answered our questions and was really helpful.  We decided to order the Whole Hog Heaven, which included 2 Ribs (Baby Back & St. Louis), 2 Meats (Brisket & Pulled Pork) and 3 sides (Shoestring fries, Roasted Corn & beans).  The meal also came with their amazing cornbread, which were delish.  I could have eaten a dozen of those cornbread muffins and been quite satisfied, since they were that good.  Our \"Whole Hog\" came on this large platter and we quickly dove-in, since the aroma of the food was captivating.  The meat fell-off the bones of both ribs, while the Brisket and Pulled Pork were tender and moist.  They also gave us a regular and spicy BBQ sauces to add to the meat.  I enjoyed the spicy a bit more and would have liked it to be a bit hotter, but understand everyone has their personal preference for spiciness.    The shoestring fries were to die for and the roasted corn was really tasty.  I didn't care for the beans that much, since they were a bit bland.    We devoured the meal and decided to order another half rack of Baby Back Ribs, Brisket and fries.  We dug-in when our other food arrived and were quite stuffed.  They gave us 2 bags of their mini cinnamon donuts at the end of our meal and they were extreme good.   The service was superb and the staff were very attentive to our needs.  The managers stopped by to say \"hi\" and see how things were going, so we gave them our positive feedback.  So glad we stopped here for dinner and I'll definitely return if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"The BBQ was very good. We had the feast a Sunday special it came wit 1/2 lb. of 4 different smoked meats and half a rack of ribs and two sides. It was plenty for our group of 4 people.  I will say it didn't disappoint as many so called BBQ places often do."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite BBQ place. You can't go wrong with the beef ribs. Customer service is always excellent! Thank you to Roman you are a great server and wish you the best of luck! Bobby Q's is extremely lucky to have you on their team"}
{"text":"We were excited to see the Bobby-Q location closer to us has finally opened! The wait time was about an hour & a half on a Friday night, but my fiancé was in the mood for steak so we decided we would wait. We actually ended up finding seating by the bar immediately, so we enjoyed our drinks and dinner there.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and made us some delicious cocktails to start. I got the Q-lada & my fiancé got an Old Fashioned. The Q-lada, although very sweet, was fruity & delicious. The toasted coconut around the rim was definitely a nice touch! The Old Fashioned was well-made and actually didn't have a strong taste of whiskey. Just a note that the other location has some drinks (like the Shipwrecked) that this location does not.  For dinner, I got a Jumbo BBQ Potato with pulled chicken & a side of grilled vegetables. My fiancé got an order of Wood Fired Steak with a side of mac & cheese and ranch beans. With the fillings in BBQ Potato, the whole thing was tasty however there was a layer of salt on the outside of the potato which made it a bit too salty. I liked that the grilled vegetables were a healthy side option but because they didn't have much flavor as some of their other sides, I'd get something else next time. I didn't try out the steak, but my fiancé mentioned that it was perfectly cooked and both side dishes were tasty. Both dishes were large, so we had plenty of left-overs for the next day!  Overall, a good meal and we'll be back again. Disappointed though that their donut machine broke just as we were getting done with dinner ... the donuts were my favorite part last time!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork roll appetizers are off the charts. Brisket and baby back ribs were delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant has wonderful food, ribs were delicious and roasted corn amazing!! The service was poor, if not insulting.  Our waitress was very assertive, rude and non apologetic."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  I can't wait to return here. Taylor is the fine manager (he has a long history serving under Bobby 'who was  the original owner of the famous Bobby Mcgees').  Be sure you ask Taylor to sing his song - he wrote about Coyotes.  The food is exceptional and the staff is engaging.  They give donuts for free dessert here in the desert."}
{"text":"I would honestly give this place 3.5 stars because of the cost but I can't. The food I got was tasty but not amazing... But the prices are pretty extreme. Great restaurant inside and out. Really neat set-up. Maybe that's why it's 25% over average cost?"}
{"text":"Food is fine, not the best bbq and a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Another place I eat at that makes me feel like my life span has been shortened. \"The Whole Hog\" combo was delicious; two different ribs, pulled pork, bbq chicken, and three sides. The price was reasonable at $50. The corn bread is definitely worthy of a 5-star review on its own. Overall an excellent brunch experience!"}
{"text":"8 of us came for lunch on a Tuesday. Birthday celebration. Waitress was noticebly short with us. Everytime she spoke it sounded rude and impatient. Not many customers in that area so I don't know what her problem was. She then included a gratuity for herself on all of our Bills.   The food was okay, never was I asked about it either. Go somewhere where they can handle a party of eight for lunch."}
{"text":"Great service from the minute we walked in. Our bartender was excellent while we waited for our daughter and then our server, Morgan was top notch. There was a mistake with our daughter's dinner which the manager immediately came over to address. She is a young adult and was fine to eat it as it came out but he was very happy/accommodating to bring her what she ordered quickly and we were in no rush. Morgan also brought us a dessert to go on the house since we were stuffed after a fantastic meal! After we paid the bill my husband noticed we had been charged twice for our daughter's meal so asked Morgan to change it. The manager comped our entire check which was not necessary but very nice. They were so nice, professional and on their game. We never had to ask for anything because they anticipated everything. This is how every experience should be!"}
{"text":"Must ask for the spicy BBQ sauce! So good!"}
{"text":"Eaten her twice and have enjoyed both times. Got the platter, which can feed a family of 4. They support local breweries with a lot of choices on tap. It seems like a big chain, but it's not, local rules! Noticed in New Times that they have started Early Bird dinners as well, smart move for the pre-normal dinner time (3:30). Keep up the great cooking and meals."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've never heard of this place before. All five in our party had great meals with lots leftover for tomorrow's lunch. My baby back ribs were absolutely excellent although I wish there was an option for a bbq sauce with a little more kick. The beer selection was solid with lots of local and other favorites on tap. The reports of donuts cannot be confirmed because I guess the machine was out of order. I'm kind of bummed that there was nothing offered to make up for that but it's just the way things go sometimes. I liked the overall vibe of the place - the music was nice and not too loud and the whole property was upscale but not pretentious."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed a special night out with Husband, we loved the theme of the restaurant, our waiter Garrett was fantastic, easy going, very knowledgeable of the menu, and was very attentive.  The food was fantastic!  I ordered the Prime Rib, I later laughed about the fact that I came to a BBQ house and order Prime Rib! I was blown away!  I asked to have it seared on both sides and it was fantastic.  I loved the sides. Husband ordered the 2 Rib dish, Beef and pork ribs, they were so Yummy. And the Corn bread, Little disks of heaven.  We also ordered the artichoke, spinach, and chipotle cheese dip, WOW, too good for words. In the end we were handed a little bag of LOVE, wee doughnuts. The only thing I have to say negative, it is a bit pricy.  We will be going back again."}
{"text":"I literally just walk out of this restaurant. My fiancé and I walked in and were seated very promptly and politely. Then we proceed to sit at the table for 15 minutes without so much as a hello from a single server. Only as we were walking out did the server say hello. She had walked past our table no fewer than 5 times. I realize this restaurant is fairly new but ignoring customers is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Amazing barbecue and a great place for large party lunches.  Fast lunch service.  Oh and did I mention the donuts ...  yum!"}
{"text":"Bobbbby Q  this was such a great barbecue spot! I came through the wrong door and they host and manager was kinda rude! But the gal at the to-go counter changed my first impression fast! The cornbread was killer, rib meat came off the bone, and all the fixings on the side were heaven! Will come back again this time we will dine in. Cheers"}
{"text":"Amazing! My family of 4 split the Whole Hog Heaven- baby back ribs, brisket, chicken, mashed potatoes, Mac & cheese & ranch beans. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner and it everything was really good! This is the first location of theirs I've been to but according to my siblings they liked the way this restaurant is set up better than the Phoenix location. We arrived without reservations and they told us the wait would be an hour and half but we were able to grab drinks and appetizers in the lounge and wait. The lounge is definitely comfortable with spacious seating and tvs. By the time we ordered and received our drinks our table was ready! It was a lot faster than they had said so that's always a plus!   Yay: -whole hog heaven: enough for 4 people. We got the beef ribs, baby back ribs, sausage and brisket. Everything was delicious! -prime rib: this smoked prime rib was definitely my favorite. Cooked perfectly with a lot of flavor! -corn bread: complimentary and probably one of the best I have ever had. I like that it comes in a disk shape so it has a nice crust and soft center. Usually corn bread can be drying but these were perfect! -cocktails: we got their sangria, the duck duck goose, and two of the ones that come in the pineapple. Everything had a good balance of alcohol, flavors and sweetness."}
{"text":"It's ok.  It's super expensive, and I know they've been on TV or whatever. And it's a chain, so I don't really expect a lot anyways, but seriously if you're already in Mesa, save your cash and go to Waldos on Main Street and Greenfield.   Free donuts don't make up for brisket made without love and overpriced drinks."}
{"text":"So yummy! I had the pulled pork platter with mashed potatoes and coleslaw. My daughter had the baby back ribs and when she took a bite, I think she about came out of her seat with excitement. She couldn't believe how the meat just fell off the bone. My pulled pork was smoky, tender and simply delicious. The ambiance is dim, casual and clean. Our waiter was super knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Very pricey for a BBQ place but it is good food. Wish the had a dance club at this location as well."}
{"text":"New favorite place in town!! Great BBQ, Great service,Great Atmosphere!!! Managers are active on the floor and Servers are attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I have to say, my 5 star experience began when I callled to make my reservation. I wish I had the girls name that assisted me. She was polite and very precise. My reservation was for 7:15 PM, however, I showed up at 6:50 PM. I checked-in with the hostess and I informed her that I was a bit early, but that I was OK with waiting for 7:15 PM to come around. She politely asked for the name on the reservation and before I could say my last name, she was already gathering the menus while politely saying, your table is ready Mr. Flores.   She passed us on to a lady (maybe the Manager) who escorted us to our table while asking us how our day was and several other questions. She was truly engaging us in conversation. As we sat down, she told a little about the menu and politely excused herself and on her way she went. Then, Jessica, our waitress arrived, and took our experience to the next level. She was funny, she laughed at my jokes, and was very informative with the menu items. She truly seemed intrigued in making sure we enjoyed ourselves/experience. Thank you, Jessica.   All that said, the food was amazing. I believe we had the baby back ribs, the Quesadilla with brisket, the brisket BBQ sandwich and the BBQ sausage plate. We were a party of 4 and we all truly enjoyed our food. It was beyond delicious. We'll definitely be back and hope anyone reading this review, makes their way over to Bobby Q's.   And yes, this place is 'Primetime'!"}
{"text":"This place did right by us. Good job. The wife and I went out on a date night (without the kids). So we decided to try this place for the first time. We ordered and our wings came out. FYI wings are delicious. Then we waited for our order which didn't come out for a really long time. So to make things right they paid for our meal and gave us a gift card so we could come back and have a better experience. I could really tell they were sorry for the inconvenience. We are looking forward to going back. I'm so glad that places still exist where the customer is treated properly."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Bobby Q,s was yesterday for lunch. The decor was welcoming and so was  the staff! Being so close to the 60 and Stapley they managed to muffle the sound with a great water feature. Our server Troy was informative and attentive. The food was great, my steak was cooked to perfection. Beast of all my cocktail...Duck Duck Goose was delish....the ice was so hard it barely melted, making the last sip as good ad the first. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service. Must eat the cornbread - it is amazing! So glad there is a location in the East Valley now."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The service fantastic. The manager even walked around speaking with customers making it an even better experience. Don't miss this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to Bobby Q's several times in Mesa and Phoenix. The ribs are overly greasy and fatty. I've never gone back after my 4th visit and if a client suggests Bobby Q's; I always offer a better restaurant."}
{"text":"They lure you right off the freeway with the delicious smokey meat smell wafting in the air. We went on a Thursday it was really hopping! Our waiter (I can't remember his name!) was really nice and gave us great advice on the menu. The food came fairly quick too; we'd only just started our game of crazy 8's at the table when it came out. The meat was tender and delicious. It's a little on the pricier side for me (college student) so I'm going to save this as a restaurant to wow friends and family with (or bribe family to take me for food ;) ). Ah! I almost forgot the mention the free donuts they give out at the end of the dinner that they make fresh at the door! Super delicious and gone quickly even after we were all stuffed from dinner."}
{"text":"Had the 2 meat combo - sausage and brisket, with beans and Mac and cheese. The sausage was good, not very spicy, but tasty and I would order it again. The brisket was very tender and good. I tried their spicy sauce but it wasn't. The beans were in a vinegar based sauce, and I didn't like them.  So here is the best part: the Mac and cheese was fantastic, and the service was great. I am a tough Barbecue critic. My fav is Little Miss BBQ, but service and location make this a more likely option. Melissa had the fried Chicken, Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The chicken was good, and the breaking was very flavorful. Potatoes were thick, not bad, just ok. They give you mini cinnamon doughnuts to go when you leave, which is a nice touch.  I give the service and Mac and cheese 6 stars. We'll be back, to try other stuff, and more Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I took the family for a Birthday dinner.  It was our first visit. The staff was attentive. The manger stopped by to check in.  Great food. Priced well for the quality and quantity.   We went back over the weekend for a snack and drink. This time we sat outside in the Bar/ Happy hour area.  Again a great experience.  Staff was again friendly and attentive. Manager was very involved."}
{"text":"It was up between Bobby q and 2 other places and Bobby q won. I went with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and I am so glad we went! The service was amazing and the beef brisket was even more amazing. The spicy hot BBQ sauce was so good! We got 10% off because of the Yelp offer. At the end they gave us a little Baggie of fresh mini doughnuts. Highly recommend this place and we will be back! Great experience!"}
{"text":"We had heard amazing reviews about the location in the West Valley, so we had to try it. The food was outstanding! We had ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. Not one complaint. The only thing we disliked was we felt we were being rushed so they could flip the table."}
{"text":"Food was great. Had the baby back ribs. They were really good. Recommend you come thru if you are in town"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ! One of the best in town! Service was great, we had Cassandra. Me and my wife got the whole hog platter! It was all fantastic, more then enough food for tw"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I am definitelycoming back. try their q-rolls they're amazing! Our server's suggestions were on point. So glad we decided to try this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and great service! We made a reservation and they got us seated within 5 minutes.  All the meat was very tender (I had the brisket, husband had the pork) and the sides we savory.  The freshly made donuts were amazing! The servers we quick without us feeling rushed.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Bobby Q as it just opened in Mesa. The atmosphere was fun. We were seated at the time we made reservations for, which doesn't always happen at other places. They haves social bar which we were able to sit, watch a game and have a drink/appetizer while waiting for our table. Our server Justin was great. The complimentary cornbread before and the donuts after dinner were very good. The meal was good, meat was well prepared and had good flavor and the sides were great as well. We would go back for some more!"}
{"text":"Two...I guess? Waited for an hour for a reserved table. Must be good? Will never come back.  Update:  I meant to come back in here and update this - the manager took care of us once he found out we were waiting for so long. Three stars for the AWESOME food, and the great management. He definitely made us feel a lot better about going back, which we have."}
{"text":"Walked into the place and they are playing 80's music....in a BBQ restaurant. Ok. Whatever.   Our server (Joe) it was either his first day or someone trained him to not give us a second to ourselves. If he would've pulled a chair and sat at our table he probably would've been less intrusive.   One of the female servers was walking around with high set pigtails like she was an adult entertainer. It was awkward.   The managers table touch was a bit strange as well. He looked to old to be working in a restaurant. He would have been better suited for a divey biker bar.   The ribs were really good! Like amazing which is why I've even given this experience a 2. The sides on the other hand were all really bad.   The ranch beans had a odd after taste they weren't good.   The mashed potatoes ( yes they messed up mashed potatoes) had so much sour cream they were bitter completely inedible.   My daughter ordered the mac and cheese & she said that was too thick and not flavorful.   The worst part is the food is double the price of Texas Roadhouse across the street.....   We've eaten at the strange night club one on the west side & hoped this one would be better but I really can't believe it's actually worse. There is such a lack of options on this side of town for good places to eat that it being this bad is a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm a great granny and when my adorable 6 y/o GGD stayed a couple of days with me, I was determined we would not be eating at McDs. We pulled into Bobby Q and we were not disappointed. Our server was terrific. I mentioned I'd never been there before so when I waffled over potato salad and pecan cole slaw she graciously brought me a bit of both. A rather big bit, I must say, and both sides were delicious. Cutie Pie loved the toothpick fries and her ribs. We both had enough leftover to take home.   If you are a plant person, you must go just for the plants; they are gorgeous. They've created their own microclimate and the scents will take you to a moss-covered forest in Marin County. It is truly lovely."}
{"text":"One of the better barbecues in the area.  The food was excellent and the donuts weren't given justice as we were too full to enjoy."}
{"text":"We ordered babyback ribs, pulled pork, half a chicken, and beef ribs..... Everything taste good overall but everyone thought the chicken was a little bland.  The next day everyone who ate the chicken were fighting over the bathroom. 24hrs of potty issues. We thought maybe it was something else.  4 days later only one person ate the leftovers including chicken and baby back ribs while everyone else had Pete's fish and chips... next day that person is living on the toilet!"}
{"text":"I've been curious to try this place after seeing it's reviews. Overall my boyfriend and I's dining experience was really nice. This place had a decent sized bar, however the options for beers on tap were limited. Our waitress was very kind and attentive, she forgot about my drink and had to remind her, but she ended up taking it off our check...there was also a little mix up and we received someone else's check after she cashed us out. The pulled pork BBQ sandwich was one of the best I've had. The brisket my boyfriend had was slightly overcooked, however they redeemed themselves with the beans and creamy/thick mac & cheese. They have us complimentary sweet cornbread, and at the end of our meal...donuts?!? As if the food we'd already had wasn't enough. We will definitely be back. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere was welcoming and intimate, yet perfect for a family dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Sam great BBQ flavor and very tender.  Ribs and brisket were wonderful and this is a must return when in the AZ Phoenix area. Nice atmosphere and good food and service.  Must visit"}
{"text":"Bobby Q has a wide selection of bbq offerings and a yummy sauce. I love my bbq and have it wherever I travel so my faves are pretty locked in...but Bobby Q is making its place on the list!  The cornbread was delicious and I ate way too much before dinner. The ribs, brisket and pulled pork we tried were all tender and juicy. The best part though is the hot bag of freshly fried donuts they send you home with. Those were especially yummy hot but also were scrumptious in the morning. Great idea to keep Bobby Q on my mind (let alone the leftovers).   Try it!  I think you will like it!"}
{"text":"First time trying BBQ in AZ. Overall, very good but not memorable ribs, brisket or sausage. Main issue was over cooked- not 'well done' over cooked but soft and mushy over cooked. For example, you couldn't pick up a rib by the bone, the meat just fell off. Having said that, great flavor to the meat, and loved the sauce. The high point were the cocktails which were outstanding! These were not your typical run of the mill adult beverages. Overall, not sure if this was an off night for the meat, but would give this place a second try when in the area."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in bobby-q this time. We called ahead to see if we could put our name in when we were 10 minutes away. We were told they don't do that and the wait is 35 minutes.  My wife ran up to put our name in when we arrived so I could park the car. The time hadn't changed. We waited for 45 minutes and our \"buzzer\" still hadn't gone off yet. So I went and asked how much longer we had to wait. I was told 10 more minutes.  20 minutes went by and still no sign that we were going to be seated. By this time we only had 30 minutes to get to our movie across the street so we had to settle for firehouse subs next door and eat our sandwiches at the theater."}
{"text":"TL;DR UNLIMITED CORN BREAD AND FREE DONUTS AT THE END.  Ordered the Hog's Platter to share with the boyfriend for our first time here.  Smoked brisket: Boyfriend claimed this was the best brisket he's ever had! Very tender and melts in your mouth.  Baby back ribs: Disappointing because baby back ribs are usually my favorite, but this one was just OK. Don't get me wrong, it was still delish.  Spicy sausage: THE BEST of all the meats we tried that evening. Sooooo good. It tastes similar to Asian style sausages - kind of sweet.  Corn bread: THE STAR OF THE SHOW. The unlimited corn bread was probably the best corn bread I've ever had, and blew all other barbecue joints out of the water. The waiters even pack extra corn bread for you to take home when you leave!  Donuts: As a sugarholic, I was in heaven when they give you a bag of fresh donut holes with your check. Holy fuck. FREE DESSERT IS ALWAYS GOOD.  The true reason for the five starts TBH is the impeccable service. It was almost as if the waiters knew what I wanted before I asked. Boyfriend started getting suspicious that the entire staff was all mindreaders - that's how on point everything was!  We left, convinced that our awesome waiter had psychic powers."}
{"text":"Given the reviews of this place I was really looking forward to the BBQ. When they brought out the cornbread to start, I was very excited because h  cornbread tasted amazing. Then the BBQ came out...ordered pulled pork, brisket, spare ribs and baby back ribs. Baby back ribs were almost boneless and it was very weird. I actually think these were the worst baby back ribs I've ever had. The brisket and pulled pork were not bad. The spare ribs were just normal spare ribs to me. I wasn't a fan of the sides but my wife liked them. Overall, I was very disappointed in this place and it doesn't even come close to Little Miss BBQ."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch there on Saturday. Food was amazing and the service was great (thanks to our sever Zach--he was awesome)! It's a brand new restaurant for Mesa and I think they will do great here! We had the ribs and they literally fell off the bone. The roasted corn was also a favorite. We also loved the pepino diablo margarita!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! service was great and the brisket was made in heaven. everyone should check this place out!"}
{"text":"I love their food and drinks! It is my new favorite place to eat. I have had Fish, BBQ, Ribs, Sausage----its all good."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best steaks I've ever had and I'm a connoisseur of food in general. The delicate wood fired flavor with the freshest of meat was salivating. I've also been in the service industry for 21 years and had absolutely amazing service from Laura Lynn. Lastly, I cannot forget to commend the kitchen staff for perfectly cooked steaks. We will be back and I will recommend this place to everyone. Even at my own restaurant. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing waiter, Joe and manager who came by a few times. So refreshing to see a restaurant care about customer service!  Food and ambiance was also amazing.  Glad to have you in the neighborhood and we will be back :)  Only negative was not being able to get happy hour unless you were at the bar which was full."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite spot everything we do family-oriented birthdays we will be here customer service is amazing food is phenomenal. My husband's New Addiction Bobby Q's"}
{"text":"Great BBQ and I liked the homemade donuts that they make right in the open by the front of the restaurant. I will definitely come back and eat there again the next time I come to Mesa!"}
{"text":"We often try BBQ (over the years and across many states).   This is the best BBQ we have had.    We had the The Whole Hog to sample different meats, with the baby back ribs and St. Louis style ribs, the brisket and the chicken.  This was a generous half rack of each rib type, 1/2 chicken, and 5-6 oz of brisket.  The brisket was the moistest brisket we have ever had. All of the meat was \"fall off the bone\" tender.  Everything was very tasty.   We had the roasted corn (a bowl off the Cobb with a couple slices of on the Cobb) and the mashed potatoes - both nice, and the mac & cheese which is very cheesy and creamy.  Each were about a pint.  It also comes with moist cornbread (3 pieces).  There was enough food for us to make six meals out of this and we took most of it home  We also had an appetizer, the Cajun shrimp, which was flavorful without being very spicy and made with very large shrimp.  They handed out free mini donuts at the end.  We are. It donut people and we're full but the batter was very flavorful and after a taste and going back for just one more taste they were all eaten.  From now this will be the place we go for barbecue as it is so much better than the rest."}
{"text":"sooo good! has amazing food at reasonable prices. service is always great. oowwhh and the donuts at the end! oof to die for! highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's who.  The service is better. Food is best BBQ in a sit down restaurant in east valley. Enjoy this place"}
{"text":"Everytime I eat here it's amazing. I'm glad they finally came to Mesa.. closer but just as amazing. This place rocks.. the food and service is top notch."}
{"text":"Have gone 2 times and would not go back some people may like the joint but not for our taste. kind of like a place that is dressed up and nowhere to go. I have eaten many places throughout the country so I do feel I am able to voice my thoughts on a lower level."}
{"text":"Bobby Q has got to be one of my favorite places for BBQ in the state. I can't believe for years I was eating at Famous Dave's for so long because that place is wack compared from here. The steak to the ribs and brisket is awesome. I do recommend not ordering chicken though. I recommend getting extra white gravy it's literally the best thing ever. Btw you do get free donuts at the end and they are fried in peanut oil."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Bobby-Q's to enjoy a date night and shared the whole hog. Oh my goodness we could have fed a family of 4 off of that. The food was delicious especially the brisket! The manager stopped by twice and was super pleasant. Our waitress was a delight, and very quick to make sure we had everything we needed. To top off the evening the manager gave us our meal. What a great thing to do. It was appreciated, and unexpected both. We took our box of leftovers, and those amazing little donuts they give you happily home. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Sitting at the table now and it's taken 10-15 min to be acknowledged. All the tables you see in the pic were empty when we got here. So the service today was lacking... Ok hold on...we just got our food and... It was well worth the wait. This food is delicious !!! The ribs did have quite a bit of char can you can taste that more over the meat and smoky-ness Great atmosphere minis the flys. It is more of an upscale barbecue restaurant than it is of a Smokehouse lounge. All in all we had a great time and we will be back again, hopefully the service will be a little better next time."}
{"text":"I was overall satisfied with my visit here. We came here for dinner on Christmas Eve and was really surprised that 1. They were open and 2. How busy they were. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. We both got the two meat platters. I had the chicken and the brisket, with mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese as my sides. The chicken wasn't anything special, It was tender but it was also very much bland. It reminded me of rotisserie style chicken you'd get at the grocery store. For how much you pay for a plate (25.00 each for a two meat platter) nothing should be bland. The brisket though was really tender and had the perfect amount of juiciness. It definitely stole the show. The mashed potatoes I had were loaded but still even with the extras there was very little flavor. The Mac and cheese was really, really good though. It had some hints of cream cheese flavor which was really surprising and very good. The cornbread also was made fresh and came to the table hot and perfectly cooked. My boyfriend had pork and brisket as his two meats and felt that both were tender and very flavorful. He also agrees that the potatoes were bland and wasn't very satisfied with them.  One thing that really bugged me was we got BBQ sauces that came with our meal. Personally I like my BBQ spicy. The BBQ sauce we were told was hot had no heat whatsoever. It was flavorful but it wasn't a \"HOT\" BBQ sauce. More mesquite. Overall, the place was good. I would come back to try it again but it wouldn't be my first BBQ place of choice in Phoenix."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars This restaurant is ah may zing! We just went yesterday, so a Sunday afternoon around 2pm. We were greeted immediately and seated. Staff was great, pleasant and informative. We asked to be seated outside on the patio because we felt like it reminded us of Louisiana with the brick and plants. The only thing about the patio was the black cushion on the bench was quite dirty.  This was a great time to go, not very many customers, although patio was packed.  Both the hostess and waitress told us about the food, the smoke process and Sunday special, which we got. Drinks came quickly. Food also came pretty quick, which considering it is already cooked,we expected, but the speed still surprised us.   Cornbread cakes were complimentary, I actually didn't like them. They were super airy on inside and greasy browned on outside, I prefer a more cake like or dense cornbread. My husband liked the cornbread though. The Sunday special says it feeds 2-3, but it could feed 4 adults with just the meat, but the size of sides can feed 2 adults and 2 kids or 3 adults pretty well. The brisket and ribs were both our favorites!  Meat was fall apart and fall off the bone, really well seasoned and sauced, fantastic! And the 3 sauces, regular, spicy and a vinegar based were all super yummy, except the vinegar one was not a preferred choice for us, but still had lots of flavor.  The pulled pork is also quite good, but I like mine to have crispy edges/pieces this was all very soft. The chicken, well it was okay but we won't order it again. Although cooked well, after you remove skin not much flavor underneath.  Update: We had the leftover chicken the following day, and we could really taste the smoke flavor in the meat, vs. at the restaurant we could not. The chicken is upgraded and made good leftovers. The ribs and brisket will be our next order.   For our sides, we got the pecan slaw, which is a sweet, mayo based slaw with some fresh pecans on top. We actually liked it more after we got home. For some reason, you could taste it better and it seemed to have a slight smoke flavor to it. The mac n cheese was creamy and delicious and we gobbled that whole side while we were there.  Our waitress was on top of everything and attentive. If you get a to-go box for coleslaw, don't use white foam containers. Somehow it leaks out.  At the end when you are super full, they bring you donuts. Freshly fried, warm,greasy sweet donuts. So full, so very full but happy belly."}
{"text":"The service was fabulous, HOWEVER, two days and counting after our visit on September 24th, my family of six and two guests still have diarrhea! I must say that this has been a sh*ty experience."}
{"text":"We came in this afternoon to try out Bobby-Q for the first time ever, not just this location. We were warmly welcomed to a very relaxing environment and a smiling face. We were sat near the back of the restaurant were you could still see the outside sitting area and hear the water fall, this made for an amazing ambiance.   We then met out server Aaron. This man was VERY well informed about everything they do down to how they smoke the meat. I have to admit I did laugh a little as he continued on with all the knowledge he was trying to bestow after finding out it was out first time. Once we were well informed about everything he asked for our drink order and proceeded to ask if we wanted any starters, we asked for a few mins to examine the rest of the menu, not 2 mins later he was right back and on time for us to choose.   We started with the smoked wings for a starter. The flavor of the wings alone was enough to bring be back 1000x over. The wings came on what seemed to be a cornbread skillet, 2 sides held carrots and celery, 3 more held the hot sauce, ranch, and BBQ sauce, all 3 were amazing. The last few sides did hold all the wings which were about 10-13 ( I didn't count because they were too good to keep looking at.). We also at the same time placed our order for the entrees. I ordered the \"Sliced BBQ prime beef brisket\" and my wife ordered \"The perfect hamburger\". When we asked for the burger Aaron asked my wife if she liked onion strings, which she loves. He suggested getting one of his favorites which was the smokehouse burger. The flavor of the meat and the smoked bacon on it was just phenomenal. The brisket was so tasty and tender, it fell apart in your mouth. We both ordered baked potato for our sides which were stuffed to the brim with bacon onion and cheese.   While we were waiting for our entrees Aaron brought us some cornbread and butter. The great thing about this is they were personal sized cornbread, coaster sized. The fluffy texture and taste was a great way to get started as our entrees had just arrived shortly after.  I can't stress how great a server Aaron was, there were times that our drinks were half food and he was already on top of refills, his vast knowledge of the menu and being able to suggest new items or even a better item for your taste. Too top everything off at the end when we were given our check they brought mini doughnuts to our table in a to-go bag, this wasnt just for us as I had seen others leave with similar bags.  The whole staff here acknowledged us as we were both coming in to be seated AND when we were leaving. I'm not sure if it was the manager who came over to our table as we were about to leave and grabbed a few plates and asked how our visit was and if it was our first time. We explained it was our first time and because of Aaron it was a great experience and we would be returning for the food and service.   This place should receive a 10/10 if passable but 5 it must be."}
{"text":"I had my first visit and the place was amazing!!! A little pricey but absolutely worth it! I'm very picky when it comes to meat or BBQ at all but the food here was full of flavor and the staff was on top of it! Not to mention the establishment itself! Beautiful! I love palm trees and this place is surrounded by em! Most likely to return soon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation via open table. We got there 7 min early and was.told to wait they were cleaning our table for us. Then the hostess  said that they may have to move us if we weren't done in an hour and a half. They were having a large party coming. I could have cared less. I told them that they should never have granted our reservation especially if they are going to time me. Anyway I  spoke to the manager about this and she made it right. So I  thought. I got up to use the restroom only to return to an empty setting where my silverware, plates and drink had been removed leaving only my napkin.  My wife who was sitting there eating her meal was shocked it happened so fast she could not have said anything as her mouth was full. This second blunder by the resturant was the last straw. The Food was good and I  will probably give them another chance, but only one more! My money is appreciated at other businesses in the area. But everyone has a bad day, this place just had one. They made it right. I'll see on my next visit."}
{"text":"Our server Dalton was awesome so attentive. Food was great my hubby absolutely loved the Mac n cheese steak was tender oh and when you leave you get fresh made mini donuts oh my gosh   Definitely coming back next time we are in town YUMMY"}
{"text":"Worth the wait! This place has a long wait. But the food is worth it.  The corn bread is the best. They serve this to everyone. And the bbq was one of the best I've had.  My family shared the whole hog plate. It had baby back ribs and beef ribs. They baby back were better. I probably will not get the beef ribs again. We also had brisket and pulled pork. So delicious. I also really enjoyed their mashed potatoes.  I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves four stars compared to the competition in the valley, but in bbq saturated markets like Texas or North Carolina, it would be 3 stars.  I enjoyed the spicy bbq sauce with the perfect amount of sweetness, but the regular sauce was very bland and too sweet.  The pork was moist and tender without globs of fat.  The mac n cheese was a solid choice, yet I regretted ordering the potato salad.  The doughnuts and cornbread were actually the highlights of the meal.  I realize profit margins are slim in the bbq business and still found the prices to be too high."}
{"text":"Being from Texas I have had my fair share of BBQ and it's one of my favorite things to go out and have a family dinner for. But this is not BBQ. Brisket had almost no smoke flavor and it tasted more like a roast. I can't tell you what the meat for the ribs beef and pork tasted like bc he BBQ sauce was so overly sweet. The chicken had a weird after taste due to the seasoning. The only good tasting thing that came from here was the Diablo Margarita I got so that deserves one star. We literally left half our food there."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Bobby Q. Have heard really good things from friends. So, we gave it a shot. Had a reservation for 5:45pm. We showed up about 5 minutes early and were met with a decent sized crowd outside waiting. We checked in with the hostess and were told a table was ready, they just needed to get it cleared off. 40 minutes later, we were still waiting for that table to be cleared off, apparently. Folks who came in with later reservation times were being seated before us. There were others who had a 5:30pm reservation and were still waiting.  People started complaining, and it seemed that those who did, got seated right away. Had to make a fuss with the hostess, and magically, we were seated within a few minutes.  The manager visited our table after we were seated and comped us an appetizer without us asking for it. The server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered our food and it arrived fairly quickly. I got the ribs and brisket. The brisket was very good. The ribs had really good flavor, but were mushy.  They were just too overdone. My wife got the filet. Which, was very good, cooked perfectly.  Overall, this was a pretty good BBQ place. . Not sure it was worth the wait, though. I get that they were busy, but we made reservations for a reason."}
{"text":"Ok the food was 5 star.  As always. We were party of 9 as we were treating our family before they had to go back to Seattle. So maybe the server thought she was getting an auto gratuity. Lol cost her 20 dollars at the minimum But the service was terrible.  Empty drinks, no plates when corn bread was FINALLY brought to table   Had to ask a manager for them but he did not follow up on service. First time in 6 visits to this restaurant that a manager has not approached our table to ask about our experience. No offer for alcoholic drink refills. Really this was a party   Waited for everything we asked for. The food was not good enough to pay $300 for a meal and have terrible service.   I was completely embarrassed I recommended this restaurant to my family for a celebration dinner"}
{"text":"Best happy hour! Incredible margaritas and pitchers of beer for $5! Gave was great! Happy hour menu, though a bit limited is still good. Love the beef sliders. Add pulled pork sliders to the HH menu and I'll be in heaven!"}
{"text":"Finally able to get to Bobby Q's and it did not disappoint. We made a reservation which was nice to be able to do. My wife and I shared the Whole Hog Heaven and it was superb. We also ordered Q-Rolls and they are amazing. If you are looking for great BBQ then this place is a must."}
{"text":"Thank you.  Thank you.  A thousand times thank you for opening a Bobby Q out in the East Valley.  I've attempted to hit this place a couple of times but it was wall to wall people and I wasn't in the mood for that foolishness.  My husband and I finally had a weekday off together and rolled in around 2:30 in the afternoon for a late lunch.  Perfect.  Their lunch specials (11-4 M-F) are the best deal.  We got a generous amount of delicious food for under 15 bucks each.    Of course I had been dreaming about the Q rolls for months and we started with those.  They disappeared in about 5 minutes and I did not eat more than my fair share.  I swear.    I had a pint of Big Blue Van ($3) and my husband tried the AB InBev Four Peaks Odelay which is a delicious Mexican chocolate brown ale ($4).  He had the rotisserie chicken with mac & cheese ($14) and I had the smoked sausage lunch with mashed potatoes ($13)  Holy moley...fantastic.  It's all good, but that mac & cheese has to be the best I've ever had.  We ended up finishing that and taking most of the potatoes home.  I can turn those into twice-baked or make eggy potato patties in the morning with more over easy egg deliciousness all over them, but I digress.  I love that they use real potatoes.  And don't even get me started on the cornbread and the cinnamon sugar donuts.    I didn't catch our bartender's name, but she took great care of us.  I like all the seating choices too.  It looks like they have 2 patios and there are plenty of smaller booth and table areas to break up the crowds so it doesn't seem so loud in there.  I bet the other restaurant owners in the area are shaking in their boots because Bobby Q is almost always packed and always delicious."}
{"text":"We visited this location a few days after trying Waldo's BBQ. We really wanted an honest comparison.   Our server was great, really on top of everything. Our drinks were overpriced - $11 for a margarita...hmmm I don't know. We ordered a sampler plate which gave us 3 meats - ribs, pulled pork and brisket. We got the coleslaw and Mac and cheese.   All the meats were great - could have used maybe more sauce? The coleslaw was very average and the Mac and cheese was very very creamy. At the end of the meal they give you a little bag full of fresh mini doughnuts. A nice touch.    I would argue the cornbread was better than Waldo's...but to me, the sauce, ambiance and overall cost of Waldo's made it the winner to us.  Would still recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I have always loved Bobby Qs location in Phoenix, it was just really far. My husband and I love good BBQ. I told him about the amazing mac n cheese and when Mesa location opened we went. He agreed it was the best mac n cheese he had ever had. We had a great meal, very attentive service and it wasn't horribly over priced. I cannot wait to go back and have more mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants! We love the atmosphere in the bar and dining area. The food is delicious. The cornbread at the beginning, and the cinnamon donuts after, are yummy!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love everything we had here.  My one and only complaint, and I'm writing it first because it's important, is that their donuts (complimentary at the end of the meal) are cooked in peanut oil. We checked on the way out and it IS posted at the front, but it's a bit hard to read and we definitely didn't notice until we were actively looking for it. I'm strongly allergic to peanuts and the only reason we found out was because we were talking about other desserts with our waitress and she mentioned it when I said I was allergic. I'm not sure what I'd want them to do instead but as it's not a common thing to cook donuts in peanut oil, I'd say it needs to be more publicized.  Our waitress was Ashlynn and she was amazing! Super energetic and informative about everything on the menu, plus she brought us extra cornbread.   I got wings for my entree which come in a really cool skillet with different dipping sauce compartments. They were crispy and delicious - and I got mac and cheese as my side, also perfectly cooked and cheesy. Yum!   Also, they have Coke instead of Pepsi, which is super important. We will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Excellent food with unbeatable service. Best pulled pork in town. Cajun shrimp delicious, Cole slaw best I've had! This our new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious! Food comes out very fast so don't order unless you want your food at your table in 3 minutes! Service was great and I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Only thing was I went in on a weeknight to order to go after school. I entered the to go part of the restaurant and nobody was there. I grabbed a menu to look over the choices and was there for a while before a lady in the kitchen noticed me. The manager came out was super nice and sent me to the bar. The staff member who took the to go orders went home sick. The food and service were fantastic as I was leaving with the food a paper was taped to the door letting customers know to go to the bar to order to go."}
{"text":"I was excited to this restaurant because of the great reviews but left disappointed. The BBQ brisket and chicken was average at best. The mac and cheese tasted like it used processed American or velveta cheese. The prices were outrageous/overpriced for BBQ food. There are many BBQ restaurants better than this place with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Incredible BBQ, food, drinks, environment and service! You definitely get what you pay for folks!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Beautiful atmosphere but very busy.  That's because the food is great and the service is on top of things.  I don't have anything else to add that hasn't already been said by many other positive reviewers.  We will keep coming back, we are big fans of BobbyQ"}
{"text":"This was my second visit into the restaurant, and my husband's first. We have ordered takeout several times and always been pleased, so when it came time to choose a restaurant for our  \"Last Jedi\" date night, we thought Bobby Q would be perfect.  After our food was brought to the table, we had a couple of issues. One with an order being brought out incorrectly, and a sanitary issue that I had to speak with the manager about. The manager, Nate, was kind, understanding, and apologetic. He and his staff went above and beyond to rectify the situation. Their reaction to the situation was professional and expertly handled. I have spent a good deal of time working in restaurants and from just our brief interaction, I can tell you that the management team at Bobby Q is one of the best I've seen. Our food turned out delicious, especially my brisket loaded jumbo potato, and I am grateful to Nate and his team for making sure my husband and I were able to have a lovely date night. Y'all made us customers for life."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Food was to die for. It's pricey but you get a lot for your money, so it makes it worth it!!!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than Bobby Q's! The BBQ is top notch & super tender. The macaroni & cheese is out of this world. The cornbread & donuts is also some of the best. The service here is incredible! I'm so thankful they opened up a location closer to us!"}
{"text":"We usually go to the Bobby Q in Glendale and have never had a problem. First, we waited about 45 minutes for two people, understandable, they are busy. We got seated at a high top table for two which was wobbly and when we pointed it out, a table cleaner said he would bring us some wedges to put under the legs. We never saw him again and the wedges had been forgotten about. We befriended the couple next to us when their food was delivered to us first instead of them. Our waitress was very sweet, but she was very busy with a table of 8 that we didn't get much attention. Drinks weren't refilled until we were almost done with our meals. Our new friends waited over 30 minutes just to get their check. Food was just average. Tracey the manager was very professional in helping us and discounted us appropriately. She has extraordinary customer service."}
{"text":"Love the BBQs on the west side so happy they came out to my side of town. Looking forward to spending my Thursday nights here"}
{"text":"I like BBQ places and this was tasty.  They do not have a lunch menu so I thought it was a bit pricey for lunch.  I did like the donuts at the end.  I wish they had smaller lunch portions as it was simply too much food."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good BBQ place for the 25 years I have been living in AZ. Coming from the south we have very high standards for BBQ. FINALLY, I have found BBQ heaven! Granted their prices are pretty high but worth every penny! My only go to in Gilbert was Joe's and after eating here. We went back to Joe's and my hubby and I looked at each other and said never again! There is no comparison Bobby Q has got it all, amazing service, mouth watering BBQ and their sides are top notch!! And don't get me started on their FREE DESSERT! Yes, fresh, hot, melting, soft, sugar donuts of goodness melting in your mouth! If you have 2-3 people I recommend the Whole Hog Heaven, seems like a lot of money but we can get 4 meals out of this serving! Oh and their french fry strings on to die for!  ENJOY this is a no miss!"}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ in the valley! Ordered their platter with baby back ribs, pulled pork, chicken! Sides we ordered were MacnCheese, loaded potato, and straw fries. Everything was amazingly delicious and also the service was fast and servers were nice! Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and love it! Great service, hot cornbread, warm BBQ sauce on the side, free donuts to take home. The food is a little pricey, but when we want good BBQ and to spoil ourselves we'll come here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's one of the only good BBQ places I've had in the east valley.  The service was the best I've had in a really long time.  Our server was attentive and polite.  The staff and manager were very friendly.  They have a smooth system of operations, and it was extremely clean.  The little doughnuts they give you at the end were a nice surprise.  The food was great, and we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"There is a wait on weekends so make a reservation!  If you like meat, more meat, and heavy sides, this is the place to be. While you wait for a table you can get a bag of fresh hot cinnamon sugar donuts made in front of you on their machine in the waiting area.  Once seated, you get amazing corn bread patties that are crispy (grilled) on the outside and ultra soft inside.  We ordered the 14oz prime rib and the Hog Heaven (pick 2 kinds of ribs and 2 other meats) for 3 people and boy did we overdo it!  That should have been for 5 people.  The prime rib was as good as most restaurants. The bbq brisket and pulled pork were juicy. All bbq meats including the baby back and St Louis ribs were tender fall apart on contact. Funny thing but the sides were my favorite.  The mac and cheese was one of the creamiest and didn't up dry up and get nasty. The shoe string fries were ultra thin and salty - yum! Grilled veggies and mashed potatoes not bad either.  To conclude your meal, you get some more complimentary donuts.  Good place to come when you want to binge on meat and free carbs."}
{"text":"Came Christmas Eve, waitress was VERY rude. Rolled her eyes a few times. Sorry you had to work but should have been nice, we left a good tip considering..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  They keep the restaurant tidy, they keep it kid friendly, and the food is just to die for.  Whatever you do, don't pass up a chance to get some ribs.  Fall off the bone, and so juicy, it's my standard order.  That, and a massive baked potato!  Plus, after all is said and done, they give you a cute little baggie of house made donuts to take home, and they are so, so, so good.  I will never not recommend Bobby Q, and I come here as often as I can!"}
{"text":"After trying the delicious ribs that were offered at the Chandler BBQ festival we just had to visit the restaurant in Phoenix and it did not disappoint.  So needless to say, we were very excited when we discovered that a new location was open a lot closer to us.  The entire experience was just not the same.  The food was not as flavorful and the service was so slow. We did not visit during a peak time so we were a bit confused as to why the service was not so great.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Just before heading to Sky Harbor to fly home, I happened to stumble upon Bobby Q's after a Yelp search of the area.   I sat at the bar and ordered a golden lager while deciding on what to order. I ended up getting the Brisket sandwich with a side of Mac & Cheese.   The first thing that came out were 2 pieces of cornbread. I asked for some honey, but after taking a bite, realized that it wasn't needed as the bread was already so moist.   All it took was one bite to realize I had made a great choice. The Brisket was very tender and melted in my mouth. I asked for a side of the spicy BBQ sauce, which I liked slightly more than the regular.   I enjoyed every bite of the Mac&Cheese. It was rich and creamy and came out piping hot.   To top it off, I received 4 complimentary mini cinnamon sugar donuts for dessert. I was stuffed, so I ate 2 there and saved 2 for the next morning.   The service and food were top notch. Highly recommend to anyone in search of good BBQ in the East Valley."}
{"text":"The food was WONDERFUL, the service was NOT. I felt kind of ignored. i had dropped my fork on the ground (which was my mistake), and we all had empty glasses. i had to flag someone down for a new fork she said she would send our waiter over an it was at least another 10 minutes before we saw him. i will go back for another try, ill just need to plan on being there longer and waiting on them more."}
{"text":"The last time we went here the speed of service was really incredible for how busy it was! We had a reservation so we got to our table fairly quickly, but from placing the food order to having our food delivered was super fast! Everything tasted great too."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to this place for a long time.  I had heard great things about the Phoenix location and had been wanting to try it.  Then was excited the Mesa location was opening and kept hearing great things.  Finally went for lunch and was disappointed!!    The hot tea was served very nicely, the service was great and friendly.  The brisket appetizer that is rolled in the fried tortilla was my favorite part of the entire meal.  The cornbread wasn't as good as the reviews say, the mac n cheese was just okay and the prime rib dip sandwich that the waitress raved about and said people call to reserve was a disappointment.  Wouldn't even be interested in trying it again."}
{"text":"I have dined at the Phoenix location for years, and was in the area to take some of my team members to lunch, so we dropped in.  Service was excellent, food was excellent!!  Great BBQ can always be expected when coming here!!  Lots of menu options for sure, but if I am coming to Bobby Q - I am coming for one thing - their BBQ!!!  Look forward to when I can come again!!"}
{"text":"This place probably has the best brisket I have ever tasted. It literally melted in my mouth! The sauce was perfect!  I would have given it 5 stars but the side dishes we had were terrible. The vegetables were not fresh at all and the macaroni cheese tasted like it was made with processed cheese.   Meats YES Side dishes NO"}
{"text":"First time at Bobby-Q the food was great and the staff was super..mgr. came out to see if our food was ok, real nice!! Will be going back soon love the place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a Bobby Q close enough to get to on occasion, a new favorite to add to the rotation. Love the cornbread starter and the donuts to wrap it up. We are huge fans of the Q Rolls appetizer. I'm usually a pork fan, but the brisket really is as good as they say and goes with everything just as well as pork. Stuffed potato was good, burgers are amazing if you are feeling a bit less BBQey. We will continue to be back and add a new fan each time we bring a friend."}
{"text":"Wow! So good! We've eaten at the restaurant and have gotten a pick up order.. both times great food. Service was good in-house and boy is this place busy! They did accept a reservation though on a Wednesday night for four which was good because I was pregnant and didn't want to wait for a table. Good amount of variety on the menu- there's something for everyone! I love the warm corn bread (which you also get with take out) AND the donuts are fresh and you can't get enough of! My husband loves all of the meats and the steak sandwich and hamburger were also very good. Good BBQ sauce too! We will def be making this a regular stop .. it can be a bit pricey.. but I guess it is worth it for the quality"}
{"text":"The service was good not great took a longtime to get a seat while waited our drinks ran dry a few times and our meal arrived as ordered although my wife's food was a little cold. My ribs were tasty but the cut  was not fantastic heavy on the bone light on the meat  we all left satisfied"}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere of this place. It was my first time eating here. I ordered St Louis Style Ribs with 2 sides (loaded backed potato & ranch beans). The bones literally fell off the meat, the sides were perfect. The corn bread muffins were perfect & is served after your order is taken. After the meal, little tiny donuts are served in a cute brown paper bag with sugar & cinnamon. They make them fresh & super soft! I will definitely go back again. They give military discount which is a plus+!  The hand crafted drinks are a little pricey. Drink at home & focus on the food and choose water!"}
{"text":"I went on their preview night because this was the grand opening of their second location. I have passed this building before and always thought it was a beautiful spot. I think Bobby Q's will be it's permanent resident from here on out.   When we approached the doors they welcomed us with smiles. Right next to the check in, was where they were making fresh donuts. As we walked to our table, all you could smell was delicious smokey aromas.  Once we were seated, we had a chance to meander at the menu. There is a large variety of items from steak to your traditional BBQ. We ordered the Q rolls, which is Brisket fried with dipping sauces. This appetizer alone, was AMAZING!! The meat was tender, and flavorful.  We all ordered drinks. My husband got a Peanut Butter Cup Porter, which tasted just like a peanut butter cup. My friend got the sangria which was a nice touch with the blackberries on top. My brother in law and I ordered the Q-Lotta. This drink made me feel like I should be on a tropical beach away from Arizona.  Our meals arrived and everything was perfect! I had the baby back ribs and oh my goodness, they were so tender the meat fell of the bone. I had the side of mac and cheese and I need this in my life!! It was so creamy! My husband got the prime rib and the steak was perfect. They also gave us corn bread to go along with our food. The corn bread was moist and the butter made it taste like cake.  Overall, this place is wonderful. It's a little pricey but you are getting quality! The restaurant itself is beautiful and the food is made with pride. You want a nice date night spot where you can feel relaxed and comfy, this place is perfect!  I'll be back for some more."}
{"text":"I love this place. The management is unbelievable. They are always kind and considerate! If you have even a slight problem, they are quick to fix it. The food is amazing and the atmosphere fits the style of the place perfectly. We sat on the patio at dinner time and the mister fan was great with keeping us cool!"}
{"text":"Not the best bbq restaurant I've been had. Beef ribs were undercooked and I didn't taste no Smokey flavor. Same with chicken. Pork rib rub was too salty which ruined the Smokey flavor. They've could've done a better job with the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Food and Service were unbelievably AWESOME!! Shout out to Yelp, because this place is Hella Good!! Started with Q Rolls, Hubs had thr Filet, and I opted for the BabyBack Ribs (Warning... the Prime Rib is Popular for good reaso ... and DOES sell out!) Everythibg was prepared well, delicious, and the service was great.  Still licking my fingers!"}
{"text":"Great food and experience. Not a great place to stay for long get togethers or reunions, since they have to turn tables quick to get the long line of people in. But this place was totally great, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is beyond what we expected! I chose this place for a family dinner, made reservations through yelp, and what a treat! Bobby Q is a spot to go if you want great food and amazing service. Ashlynn was our server, or a manager- if not she should be. She guided us through the menu and was super attentive even though she was very busy. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was killer! Super moist, tender and juicy. Highly recommend. Come here and ask for Ashlynn!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite barbecue restaurant! I first started going to the one located in Phoenix for a long time, and I was so excited when another one opened up a lot closer to me. Bobby Q has by far the best cornbread I have ever had. Just the cornbread alone is a good reason to go to Bobby Q. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wowza!  You want off the bone BBQ rib, tasty tender brisket, cheesy macaroni, warm fresh baked cornbread,  YOU GOTTA TRY this place.  Came here starving and they satisfied my bottomless pit.  For the 4 of us, we ate the feast and just ordered an additional side salad for some rufage with all that meat I was going to consume. The feast did not disappoint and we had left overs!!!!  If ever I'm in town, most def., my first choice to eat here"}
{"text":"On my first visit I have to say that the ribs are cooked just right fall of the bone,and the BBQ sauce is to die for perfect taste .. Definitely will come back for more..  Eric from scorpion king Exterminating"}
{"text":"After hearing about Bobby Qs from a few friends of mine my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try. I made a reservation here on Yelp, when we got there the place was packed but they had an empty booth ready for us 20 minutes before our time!! The staff was very friendly and gave good recommendations, we will definitely be back soon! The staff were all very nice and gave us recommendations!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q has amazing food and a wonderful environment! The vibe inside and outside the restaurant is very unique. The staff are very friendly. I give it four stars due to the price. It is a little High priced. Average of $22+ a plate. But we really enjoy visiting Bobby Q every few months! Would definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Bobby Qs is the only place near me that I will eat BBQ. I have said it before that I'm not a BBQ person, but they have the best smoked ribs. Everything is smoked in house, so the smell is Divine when walking by. The spicy BBQ and Carolina BBQ are alternate choices to the original BBQ flavor. I recommend trying all, as they are all tasty. The Mac and cheese was once voted best in state, which I'm not sure if they have won any awards as of late, but I remember the original bobby Qs had better tasting Mac and cheese. Overall, I think it's one of the better and classier BBQ joints in Mesa. They have a great drink selection and appealing, dark bar area as well."}
{"text":"We went here tonight and had excellent service. Austin was our server, he was pleasant and attentive, but not overbearing! The manager Jake stopped by to make sure the food and service were good. The food was SO delicious-one of the best steaks I've ever had! And the decor is so cute, especially the outdoor patio areas. We had a great time here tonight!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! Great decor and service! The food was amazing and every side we tried was as well. They weren't add ons, they were amazing in their own right. Pricing was very good for what you get. I don't know of a better BBQ value around here. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We went to for Mother's day. It was a wonderful night with delicious food!! Our server, Caleb did a fantastic job and hooked us up with donuts!"}
{"text":"In AZ for the week on vacation and we wanted a break from tacos. My fiancé and I shared the whole hog heaven and have more than enough to have tomorrow for lunch ... yum! The atmosphere here is amazing. Our serve was very nice and attentive. Everything was amazing. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the Mac and cheese was heavenly. The cornbread was delicious. That gravy omg that gravy. I can go on and on but if you're reading this and are in the area just go and Bobby Q. Do it! Oh and to top it off we got donuts on our way out they were a sweet treat on the ride back to our resort."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I have had in Arizona. I'm from CA and usually have to order steaks one notch below liking because lots of places here overcook. Bobby Qs was cooked perfectly. The mini donuts are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. They have a fantastic lounge that serves happy hour as well as their bar. At the end of your meal you get cinnamon sugar donuts with your check. Order the steak sandwich, it's my favorite!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this place made for a great date spot.  Amazing food all the way around.  The brisket melts in your mouth.  The staff were beyond friendly, have honest opinions on the food, and accomendated a special request.  Our drink glasses were never empty for more than 2 minutes.  Remember, real barbeque is not cheap.  With that said, the prices are excellent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ in Mesa. The ribs are so tender and flavorful, they fall right off the bone! If you try this place, definitely get the mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables as your sides; they're incredible!"}
{"text":"The cornbread and al meats are absolutely amazing!!!!!!! I love this place. My favorite is the brisket sandwich. Always request the spicy barbecue sauce - it isnt really spicy, but absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The BBQ is decent.  I don't think you'd take anyone here and have then leave disappointed but I wouldn't rank it with the best BBQ i've had.  The usual wait time will probably keep me from going back because the food isn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is the classiest BBQ place I will likely ever go to--they had CLOTH napkins!!! The food was excellent and their french fries were perfect. I got the pulled pork platter which ended up being HUGE. Next time I'll just order the sandwich size on lettuce instead, but it was nice to have leftovers. The brisket was better than anywhere else we've had brisket in the Valley too."}
{"text":"Terrible today.  Hostesses ignored us.  The service was slow and inaccurate.  The food orders were wrong and the rotisserie chicken unappealing.  The manager just explained our piece had a vein, but blood?  They took it off of our bill, but it was awful.  We've been there before and had a better experience, but with so many good lunch choices, I don't see a reason to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  It's got a great county Bbq feel. They have a cozy lounge/ bar area with comfortable chairs.  The patio is great for large parties.  The bbq has a great smoke flavor. I had the smoked prime rib and was very flavorful.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  And they have a nice gluten free menu!  We will definitely be vack!"}
{"text":"So good!   Brisket that didn't need a knife just fell apart on my fork. Veggies were just ok, not fav but everything else was delicious. So glad we decided to try.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Huge place, good service, reasonable price. Now, for the BBQ... they do know what they're doing - just the right amount of smoke, rub and sauce. Even with all the BBQ joints popping up in the East Valley, this one remains one of the best."}
{"text":"We tried this BBQ restaurant last night and most everything was very good. The service was great and they were very busy. The ribs were outstanding. The reason for the three stars was the brisket. It was marbled and lined with fat. My wife ordered the bake potato with brisket and the meat was not edible for her. I ordered the two meat meal with ribs and lean brisket. The ribs were great and a few pieces of brisket were good and lean but half of the brisket was lined with fat which I cut off because I do not like fatty meat. This is probably the most expensive BBQ on the planet. We may give them another chance because we really need and want a great BBQ spot in The Valley."}
{"text":"Went to Bobby Q tonight to celebrate our 5 year anniversary... I had been looking forward to it ALL week. Usually, the steak is amazing, everything is always outstanding... Not tonight... The steak I ordered \"medium rare\" came to me way over done, and dry... I could only take 2 small bites. It was so bad... The waiter was not friendly at all.. When he asked if I needed a box, I said No, and he didn't even bother to ask if my steak was alright, he had to of noticed that I barely touched it.... I am so disappointed... Not to mention, I ordered a \"Q-Lada\" (or whatever it's called) and the menu said \"$11\" , receipt said, \"$12\" ...  False Advertisement much?  I hadn't been here in a few months, and apparently things changed quite a bit in that time. I won't be going back..."}
{"text":"Huge portions, good food flavors and great corn bread...and that is the most important part of good BBQ!"}
{"text":"I don't really get Bobby Q's hype. It's super pricey, the bbq isn't that great. The atmosphere is pretty cool and I like the free donuts, but otherwise o would never choose this place for bbq, unless everyone else wanted it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere yummy barbecue. If you are not a big meat eater this is not the place for you. I was going to give 4 stars because they dont have many vegetarian options. But that's not what they promote it's a barbecue place and their BBQ is yummy so 5 stars because the fish is delicious the ribs are on point everything is super bomb. They just need a few more healthier options. The cornbread melts in your mouth"}
{"text":"Excellent service, super cool place.. but mainly everyone there is quick helpful friendly and the food is delicious. We were there celebrating during Mother's Day and they were super busy. They took a little longer to bring our salads but we didn't even notice because we were having a good time. The manager without us saying anything apologized for the salads taking a little longer and he not only didn't charge us for them but he also offer us 2 desserts of our choice also complimentary. I recommend this place any time!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Service was fast courteous and spot on.  I recommend this to everyone.  The whole Hog Platter is a can't miss choice."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding! Our server was awesome and the food was delicious. We thought the portions would be small, but we actually ended up taking home left overs. We got free cornbread as an appetizer and free (fresh) donuts to complete our feast. On a scale 1-10, we give this place a 100. If you're looking for good BBQ, this is the place! #BeefRibs"}
{"text":"I live in Tucson, so I don't get the opportunity to go often, but when I visit my sister, we'll go to Bobby Q. I was glad to see this location open up as it's a trek to get to the location on 27th from her house. Most recently, I met my family for dinner here. We ordered Q rolls to snack on, which were delicious, love the remoulade that comes with them. Mmm. The cornbread is also very good and complimentary.  I ordered a two-meat combo with brisket and sausage and mac 'n' cheese and pecan coleslaw for the sides. All of it was wonderful. I was super hungry but didn't finish my whole meal. Portions are generous, and you could definitely share a meal.  Service was friendly and attentive. The complimentary donuts at the end are great too! I will come here whenever I get the opportunity, some of the best BBQ there is. Prices are right for what you get."}
{"text":"Best barbecue I've had in a long time! Especially the beef ribs. Tender, moist and delicious.  We also we also had the salmon which was very very good. Our server, Jesus, was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Amazing bar b q.... fall off the ribs , perfectly smoked veggies .. there pork and brisket is to die for.   They give you corn bread that jut complements the meal.... save room for the little doughnut they give you after the meal"}
{"text":"This was our first time here! Our server Brandon Y. was absolutely phenomenal, he was on top of everything and answered every question we had! My family of 3 split the whole hog platter! So much delicious food and had enough to bring home! The manager Drew was super nice as well and kept on checking on us! THE SURPRISE DOUGHNUTS PUT THE ICING ON THE CAKE! Wish there was one in Detroit so we can go there at home!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time since I've heard the one in Phoenix is excellent. Hands down, so much better than the dump RT O'Sullivans, so glad they're gone. Huge menu. Great BBQ and the pulled pork sandwich was the best I have ever had- they cook the pork for 18 hrs so it's really tender. Happy hour is until 6pm, no BBQ items available on the Happy Hour menu though. Lots of beers on draft and friendly service. Their cinnamon fried donuts make a great dessert too."}
{"text":"I gave it four stars because the atmosphere is pretty darn cool you gotta cheap out the patio areas and the laid back seating area.food was alright not bad but not GREAT. We got the three meat combo barbecue nothing to Brag  about. I do really like the touch of the homemade donuts that you get with your check. Service was great and it was very clean."}
{"text":"Sunday evening (7pm) and the place was packed. About a 45 minute wait. Three adults, a 6 year old, a 2 year old and an 11 month old and we were enticed by the BBQ aroma and the kids fascinated by the automatic mini-donut maker machine just inside the front door. The staff was friendly and the manager made the rounds of the tables to make sure everything was OK. We got the Sunday Feast Special ($40). It included a generous portion of brisket, pulled pork, two chicken halves, some ribs, two sides (we chose corn and mac&cheese), plus some tender and tasty cornbread. The only negative on the food side was I did get a couple of brisket pieces that were burnt and hard. Once I cut them off the rest was very tasty. The food was very good and even enough to take home. They gave us a little bag of the mini-donuts to take home with us as well. Parking is shared with other eating establishments and can be a problem at peak eating times. The decor is nice for a BBQ place."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Very nice place with great food.  Ribs were delicious that fell off the bone.  Also the brisket was great.  Nice staff.  And then the little suprise of sugar cinnamon donuts for desert.  Kind of expensive but not too bad.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is the best bbq I've had in Arizona, no place compares. From the beef brisket to the bbq chicken, even the sides, I have no complaints. Every time I go the food NEVER disappoints, it's always hot and no matter how many seats are filled you get your meal in a timely manner. The staff is always super inviting and fun to converse with. Also after your meal when leaving out you get complementary SUPER FRESH cinnamon sugar donuts. I recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and service."}
{"text":"As a former employee of the establishment that Bobby Q's bought out it was a weird feeling going back to the old stomping grounds. With that said I was amazed with the remodeling. It looks absolutely amazing inside and out. Not only that but all the food was delicious! From corn bread, pulled pork, chicken, mac n cheese, fries, beer and doughnuts! One of my new favorite places!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. A little pricey but you get big portions and a small bag of donuts to take with you. We'll go back soon."}
{"text":"I had to try this spot based on curiosity and great reviews. I came here towards the evening and ordered some chicken and macasroni while. waiting. Prices were fair and I waited and drank 2 delicious brewskies  Blue van and a Orange based lager. It took 20 minutes and food was delicious when I got home 10 minutes later. Prices are fair and they offer military and have yelp discount here."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious A Little Pricey We Had The Sampler 3 meats Added One side Spilt Everything Ribs Brisket & Pulled Pork. Best Brisket Since Texas ! House BBQ Sauce Very Good French Fries Mac & Cheese Happy Hour Deal if Sitting at Bar Pitchers Craft Beer$5 Bucks"}
{"text":"This place does not even need another 5 star review.  This has to be the best BBQ place in the East Valley.  Beef ribs are delish, the smoke house burger was so juicy and full of flavor.  The corn bread - fantastic.  The mini donuts they serve for free at the end of every meal are a delight.  Our bartender, Dimitri was so friendly, attentive to our needs and makes an awesome drink.  He goes above and beyond so tip him big!"}
{"text":"OMG!! Our first time to Bobbys, From the moment we walked in, to the the time we left, Our experience was first class! We were greeted by hostess AND a member of management (like we owned the place). We sat in \"Garrett's\" section, this young man couldn't be happier to see us! During our meal he (and members of management) walked the floor and made sure EVERY table had what they needed and were satisfied (as a past food critics son..NO,I never said a word:)) Garrett never missed a beat! GREAT \"team\" experience, we had 2-3 different VERY POLITE employees refilling our drinks, asking if we needed anything. It was an AWESOME experience! We never felt bothered either. There were some items on the menu that we had questions on, Garett offered us a small sample (the pecan coleslaw was to die for). They bring out corn muffins (instead of boring steamed bread) to yr table to start..WOW!! Melts in your mouth! We got the \"Hog meal\" (only critique I had was, the brisket was a little dry) the BB ribs and St. Louis style ribs were off the charts!!!  Garrett also brought us a little sack of fresh baked mini donuts to finish off our dinner:) Ive been in the customer service field for over 35 years, and myself, having to give the best customer service at my job being a MUST, it's nice to have it givin to you when u go out. I HIGHLY recommend Bobbys! I look forward to going back for the NFL Sunday $5 deals!! Food A+   Service A+   By far a reasonable 5 place to eat. Thanx Gang!! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found our new place, from the food to the staff we love this place!  the manager is awesome when thousand island is not on the menu for my husbands salad he found away to obtain it from a special they have on certain days.  They go above and beyond to help you and we love sitting in the bar it is like family even though it is so busy."}
{"text":"got 'WHOLE Hog Heaven'--brisket had a HEAVY, TOO heavy, salty/mushy covering (once removed brisket was passable. Sausage was great.  baby backs great.  Meat ribs OK, but very tough.  BBQ sauce options GREAT--spicy I REALLY liked.  French fries GREAT.  Beans, average.  Good portions.  GREAT ambiance inside.  Complementary mini-cinnamon donuts nice touch.  Alcohol was more expensive than comparable places.  Wait staff average."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and customer service! I was so indecisive with what to order, because it was my first time here, but Garrett helped me figure out what I'd like best!! I tried the Baby Back Ribs, and MAN! They really do fall off the bone! They're almost harder to eat because you have to worry about it falling off the bone, into your lap! Lol. I'll definitely be back again to try more awesome food! Oh, and try the Frosted Lemonade! It's home made and so so good."}
{"text":"We've gone to the location in Phoenix several times and this was the first time we made our way over to the Mesa location. We had a group of 8 and our server (who's name I didn't get) was amazing. He made great recommendations for those who hadn't been there before and no one was disappointed. Bobby Q's has amazing food, drinks and service. They also give you bags of mini donuts when you leave which satisfy any sweet tooth you may have. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"The thing that stands out to me is that every time I eat here the manager comes by to be sure everything is okay.  so it should be be shocking they the food is constantly great and the service is also consistently great.  I like the place.  I like the patio with the barrel water fall.  I like the big huge bar.  I generally like everything about this place.  My only complaint is that it's 12 minutes from my house. I like the corn bread.  I like the donuts.  I like the rotisserie chicken. I like the Baby back ribs.  This is probably my favorite restaurant in the valley right now."}
{"text":"I went to dinner on a Saturday night and the next morning my credit card had been used several times...be careful with your payment information. But the food and service was excellent"}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and staff make this a real winner, not to mention the donuts that they make fresh for you as you leave. You can tell the staff is very happy to be there, extremely friendly, outgoing and helpful. The hostesses, servers and the Manager all make you feel like you are part of their family. The hostess that seated us was Brianna (I think that was her name) our waiter was Joe and the Manager dropped by to ask us how everything was and had a nice chat with him as well. The food was very tasty and reasonably priced. Can't wait to go back, couldn't decide what to get because there were so many great choices, so we have to go try something different next time. The only disappointment was getting home and realizing we wanted more donuts (they literally melt in your mouth)."}
{"text":"Everything you want in BBQ plus great service. Insanely I liked the BBQ rotisserie check best - yeah me for dieting next time (yeah right). Yup we will be back! (Baby back..). Alexander was an awesome waiter - great advice great attitude and john on the spot with refills!"}
{"text":"Gotta give this place five stars. First visit was lunch last Thu. Excellent brisket sandwich at a great price. Staff could NOT have been more professional. The hot donuts were not only a great way to finish a meal but they'll also give my cholesterol medication something to do.  :) Was really impressed when the manager stopped by to say hi. Will definitely return !"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great atmosphere.   They brought out some corn bread before the meat platter and oh my goodness the corn bread was the best I've ever tried. It was so moist and buttery, it was like eating a decadent red velvet cake! Their Mac N Cheeseeeeeeeeee was indeed amazing. We got the baby back ribs, St Louis ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. They were all good but my favorite was the baby back ribs. The meat was smoked perfectly and slid right off the bones.   After the meal, they bring you these freshly made mini donuts with cinnamon sugar all over it. You'd think that after stuffing your face, you wouldn't have any room for them right? Nope, you WILL have room for them! lol I'm drooling just thinking about them again.   Definitely going back to this place. They also have a great bar so it's a great place to hang out in a bigger group."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes at my table on a Thursday night.  Had to get up and leave because I didn't even get a drink.  Saw servers but they kept tending to other tables.  Will not go again based on service received.  I heard their food is good but I guess I'll never know."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! The server we had did a great job. He always filled our glasses up and was very attentive to everything.  They give you free cornbread at the start of tante meal which was awesome. I got the pulled pork sandwich and my wife got the brisket sandwich. We both loved it! The meat was tender and melted in our mouths. The Mac and cheese was also great! We didn't have anything that we didn't like!   If you check in on Yelp they give you 10% of your meal. The manager came over and talked to us. She was super friendly. Overall we had a great experience and we are def coming back. Also, at the end of the meal they give you fresh made cinnamon donut bites!!"}
{"text":"In town visiting family and love BBQ so, let's go to Bobby Q. Tuesday nite no problem being seated. Had checked out the pictures on Yelp and knew I wanted the big pineapple drink to start off. Waiter greeted us promptly and we ordered drinks.  While waiting for my drink I decided on the slab of baby back ribs with sides of roasted corn and coleslaw topped with pecans. Drinks were served , dinner was ordered and we were also given corn bread cakes to sample. Corn bread cakes were fine. Drink was a big disappointment. Looked great , tasted great , good alcohol content but not worth $15. Not enough. Other family had mixed drinks and there were no complaints.  The food was served ,  one had the smoked prime rib , one had the filet mignon and one had a wedge salad with Blue Cheese.  I had the ribs. Prime rib was a nice cut with a good crust around it. Was told it was tender and flavorful. The filet was very good , cooked correctly and tasted great. The wedge salad was big and was full of big blue cheese crumbles, tasted great I was again told.  Now for the my meal. The full rack of baby back ribs were a good portion. With a rub and some sauce applied. Cut into them and there was a nice smoke ring in the meat but the meat fell off the bone. I want my ribs to require a little tug to remove the meat. These ,  the bones just slid out. Ate half my rack and let another family member take the rest home. Second disappointing item tonite. Good flavor though. Two sides were fine. Roasted corn was seasoned well and the chopped pecans on the cole slaw made it. The service and atmosphere were fine. Mini donuts served with the check are a nice touch.  Would go back but would not get the wimpy ribs."}
{"text":"Tried Bobby Qs for the second time and had a great experience. We ordered off the weekday lunch menu and the prices were much more reasonable ($20 for two people) compared to our first visit on a Saturday night. I had the BBQ shredded chicken sandwich with mac & cheese (probably the best mac & cheese I've ever had) and my mom had the jumbo baker with chicken plus coleslaw and she raved about the coleslaw. She said it was definitely the best coleslaw she had ever eaten. The complimentary cornbread and donuts were also fantastic and such a nice addition to the meal. The restaurant is really beautiful and very clean and our server was friendly. Really great experience today."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! I have never been disappointed in the food or service! I had the pulled pork with the macaroni and cheese and grilled veggies! Also their famous cornbread! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Our 1st visit here, they came highly recommended!! I loved the decor.. kinda rustic french provencial. The staff welcomed us and sat us quickly.  Our waiter was Joseph strubel. He was very polite and professional.  I started with asking for his recommendation ans he replied baby back ribs or the 3 meat combo..we ordered sweet tea, and a 3 meat combo, cornbread . The food portions on our combo were slightly enough for 2. I would say skimpy for 28.00 I took notice of the different tables around us for what type of food they ordered. Our meal paled in comparison.  I was sooooo dissappointed. The brisket was a double portion so maybe 6 oz total, the sausage was 5 verrry thin and overcooked pieces . The roasted corn was just okay  and the baked potato was leathery!  I have found barbecue at other joints to be a higher quality for less money.   Probably wont go back for a 2nd trip."}
{"text":"We came here for a team lunch (work related) not too long ago. I wish I'd been for dinner instead. I needed a nap after that delicious meal! This just means I must return! And I will!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is on point, the drinks are delicious and the meat is fall off the bone delicious. Q rolls are a must!"}
{"text":"The food was crazy good. We had the ribs and fried chicken, and were more than satisfied with both. Mac and cheese will stop your heart.... in a good way. Save room for fresh donuts on your way out. 10/10."}
{"text":"Me and my husband ordered take out from here a couple nights ago. Overall our Bobby Q experience was great. However, the girl who took our order, I believe her name was Brenna, was very rude to my husband and I. But the food was outstanding, definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Came here tonight to celebrate my daughter's birthday with friends. When making the reservation, I specifically asked for seating inside because I thought it would be hot outside and didn't want to deal with flies. They said no problem. When we arrived, we ended up sitting outside on the patio. Some of our guests had already been seated and they didn't want us to make it a big deal so we sat outside. The manager ended up coming outside to personally apologize and they ended up comping our appetizers. Thought it spoke volumes on their customer service.   Food was delicious and service was great. Highly recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Giving four stars out of disappointment that they don't offer the Sunday Feast like the Phoenix location. We were IN Phoenix when our family decided on Bobby Q for brunch this past Sunday and made the trek to Mesa, even though it was farther, because it was new and on the way home for half of our group.   Bobby Q is one of our favorite Valley restaurants. We pay our respects to the Phoenix location regularly!  In Mesa, the location and food measure up. Service is pretty good also. You can still order the \"whole hog\" which is slightly more expensive ($51) than the Sunday Feast but includes more food (2 types of ribs, 2 measts, 3 sides; as opposed to 1/2 rack of ribs and 1/2lb each of 3 meats plus 2 sides).   I definitely recommend the St. Louis ribs, pulled pork, brisket, mac n cheese, and the corn!   They're super generous with the cornbread which is delicious so don't be afraid to ask for 2nds!  Be sure to save room for the warm mini-donuts!"}
{"text":"Pros: the cornbread is definitely good, free donuts to go, the owner (I think) came by and was really personable and invested in the restaurant. Also those shoestring fries are   Cons: the service wasn't great, our orders were messed up, and honestly just okay bbq. It wasn't anything to write home about. I saw they were ranked as top 100 places to eat in America and that was shocking."}
{"text":"Large family gathering on a Wed night. The service was excellent and the food was great.  BBQ pork ribs were great, not too saucy and not messy.  Will likely come back as my dad loves their beef ribs.  We all took home to-go boxes!"}
{"text":"Love the quality food here! If you haven't been, you must check it out! Great staff, delicious food and some pretty amazing cocktails!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been in the hunt for a great BBQ restaurant in the Mesa area. Bobby Qs exceeded our expectations of great BBQ! The atmosphere is beautiful, dimmly lit, and great music! The food was on point. We had The whole hog meal so that we could try a little of everything. Let me tell you now that it's a lot of food. The meal included two different types of ribs, and two different types of meat and 3 sides. We were expecting small portions of each of the meats and ribs but there was enough food there to feed a family of four. We enjoyed our visit and will be regular costumers now!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent here.  The cornbread is to die forrrrrr. Extremely soft and tasty.  The smoked wings are so amazing that I come here just for them. Definitely has the smokiness and tenderness that you can't find elsewhere.   I also love the mac n cheese- it's extremely creamy and pasta is not overcooked. The mac n cheese is definitely a comfort food- nothing can go wrong when you have their mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"We tried Bobby Q's with the recommendation of a friend. My husband is from Memphis and can be a BBQ snob. We were not disappointed! We ordered \"Hog Wild\" a big plate with your choice of several meats, mashed potatoes, gravy, Mac n cheese and corn. Everything was excellent! It's by far the best BBQ in the valley. The Mac n cheese was pretty awesome too. Our server Chris was very attentive and an asset to our wonderful first experience at BobbyQ's. We'll be back and defiantly will be asking for Chris! Already looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Food, service and ambience were great. Our server Ciara was very helpful with suggestions. The manager came over to help me with my gluten-free needs. We had the spin-dip (veggies instead of bread for me). It was probably my favorite part of my meal besides my amazing drink: the Q-lada (pina colada + strawberry purée rimmed with toasted coconut). I had brisket and hubby had the ribeye. Both were good. Hubby loved the cornbread but I couldn't try it. Same for the dessert donuts. Nice added touch. Now that it's cooling off, will probably sit on the patio next time (lots if TVs to catch the game)."}
{"text":"Love Bobby Q mesa. I typically go here for lunch as I work nearby. Food is flavorful and cooked with care. Drinks are good but rather pricey. Love the cinnamon donuts."}
{"text":"Insane BBQ. Everything we had was amazing. Cornbread was perfect, brisket was smoked to perfection and the BBQ sauces are incredible. Best BBQ I've ever had. will frequent here when I am in Mesa. And they give you fresh fried donuts as you leave... awesome"}
{"text":"Today my son and I were looking for a BBQ experience in the Chandler/Mesa area. As I started yelping Bobby Q showed up. We had checked their original location in Phoenix some time back and were more than satisfied. So we decided to check out their relatively new location in Mesa. When you have had a good experience why not reaffirm your prior experience with another one.  I am glad to report that today's experience was as good if not better.  The ribs, the chicken and the brisket were top notch. The sides (corn, corn bread, pecan slaw) beautifully complemented the entrees.  The new location has the same cozy and comfortable vibe as the original.  The service, once again, was impressive: friendly, prompt and courteous!  Guys all I can say is BRAVO! The consistent quality of food and service is your domain."}
{"text":"Visited this place as I'm in that area quite often and watched it getting remodeled from RTOsullivans to it's new identity. Set a reservation for 7pm on a Friday night. We got there about 20 mins early but were accommodated with a table within 5 minutes.  First impression was fair, certainly smells good. Fairly large crowd was inside and it's pretty dang noisy. Ambiance was ok and the chairs were comfortable enough.  You're greeted by a number of people. Our server, Michelle, was outstanding. I have a lot if hospitality experience and noticed trainers and at least 3 management members working. It felt as though the wait staff are being trained by professionals. Michelle was great! She handled everything I threw at her well and with a smile.   My first request was a glass of wine. It came quickly. As i tilted the glass to drink I noticed a strong odor like a chemical cleaner. I did indeed swallow a bit before I could stop. One of the wait staff stopped by with water for us and I asked him to smell it. My girlfriend smelled it also and we all agreed somehow the glass had not been properly cleaned and rinsed. It was removed and a fresh glass and new wine brought out. I was concerned that i might get sick however so far so good. One reason this place didn't get 4 1/2 or 5 stars is the fact we were charged for the wine. If you had smelled that glass, comping it would be logical.   We ordered the Calamari appetizer. I've never seen such large pieces of Calamari and we both felt it was much better than most we'd had. It's called 'Calamari steak' and each piece was somewhat large. Coated in a Panko like crumb mix with good cocktail and decent tartar sauce. It was very good.   We shared a combo at $36 for prine rib and jumbo shrimp. I don't recall what the shrimp is called (kind of like calamacchi or some such name) the prime rib was smoked. It didn't have an overwhelming smoke flavor like some other places have. It was a bit overdone for medium rare and dry. But flavor was very good and the rub on it was good also. The shrimp were great! I'll have to go back to get that name again, but similar to a pesto sauce and grilled over a wood fire.   Sides were a baked potato (hard to ruin that, it was good), roasted corn (way overcooked and being so it almost tasted like it came out of a can), and grilled vegetables that were good. Veges had bell peppers, red onion, squash, and zucchini then grilled over the wood grill. Very tasty.  Overall the food is very good, and service was outstanding. If i could rate service separately I would give a big 5. Prices are on the high end. Many of the drinks were lower than most at $2 for ice tea to $2.50 for soda.   We were pleased overall, would recommend to friends, and will go back. I doubt the prices will get adjusted down and that is another reason for not getting 5 stars."}
{"text":"The original Bonny Q's is a family favorite. We thought we would try this new one and I have to say.....pretty darn good too. The service was great and the food is two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm absolutely in love with this place. I usually don't dig BBQ places and they never seem to taste good to me but this place has definitely changed that. I love the q rolls so much! The brisket is to die for! I don't dig the ribs that much but I guess it depends on what you like? I felt it wasn't as flavorful as I'd like it to be but other than that the food was great! The mac and cheese delish!!! Mashed potatoes bomb.com! The server tony I believe he is mostly at the bar but he is just so amazing. Really provided great service and took care of us real well. Gave us donuts when we were finished too, I can appreciate some free dessert! :) coming here again and taking the whole family!"}
{"text":"great food, love the environment, best part doughnuts end of thr meal! customer service was great, drinks on point and they were very good at what they do"}
{"text":"So I ordered a pound of beef brisket, some veggies and potato salad. Was in a hurry so I left without checking the food and pull out this bulls$it. Thinking maybe I was crazy but weighed it on my kitchen scale and it was less than 16oz WITH the container. First time and last time when this is how you treat paying customers who tip on orders to go!!!"}
{"text":"Just read the reply from the liar at bobby Q. Son I have forgotten more about BBQ than you will ever know. What you served me was NOT BBQ it was slow roasted brisket. Your a hack and a full of faux q. No mention of the bark that should be on all pit smoked meats. Your the fraud and no amount of your BS will change that."}
{"text":"Bobby Q's is simply the bomb! Best BBQ in the valley! Great food and lots of it. Great service. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere when we walked in the host was friendly and fast to seat us,  but once we were sat at the table the service slowed down dramatically. Everyone was brought complementary cornbread except our table so we had to ask for it. Ordered calamari for a high price and just 6 small pieces of bland non seasoned calamari. Save your money on this appetizer. The manager Alexandra came by and asked how everything was tasting and we gave the honest opinion and she came by and offered to take it off which was unexpected because even though I was unhappy with it i still was going to pay for it so that was something very kind she did when she did not have to.  Overall service I'd give a 10 out of 10 and as for the food I'd give a 5 out of 10. Nothing had the wow factor that would keep me coming back.  However the service Alexandra gave was above and beyond not just for removing the calamari but she constantly came back to make sure everything was ok and sent us home in very pleasant mood."}
{"text":"Pros: The BBQ was very good. The service was good.  Cons: and reason I didn't give it 5 stars because the cornbread was super greasy but the fries were amazing. Maybe it deserves 5 stars. I had concerns about the peanut oil they use but learned after that it is not an allergen so that's pretty great. I will say it's the best BBQ I've had in PHX."}
{"text":"I have to say the prices are very high for the quality given. $12.00 for a pulled pork, on a hamburger bun with just 1 side.  $13.00 for beef brisket.  Then $4.00 yes $4.00 to add sautéed onions.   The meat was good but not outstanding.  Thank you Chef was more the price point compared to other good BBQ in close proximity.   Roll, pickle, only 1 side and 3 to 4 ounces of meat at $12 to $13 plus $2 ice tea is a pricey lunch."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ restaurant I've been too! All there meat is smoked for 18+ hours like it should be. So this place is a must try because there food is phenomenal and you get free mini donuts before you leave so how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Tons of great food for a great price! Plan on waiting 45 minutes on a busy night, but worth the wait. The cornbread they give every table is awesome and the cinnamon donuts are to die for! I had 2 meat meal: baby back ribs and brisket with fries and Mac n cheese. So good"}
{"text":"Cornbread is phenomenal however it's not even close to good barbecue well overpriced for the quality of food"}
{"text":"Best bobby Qs in AZ! Service food and doughnuts :) always coming back to this location, much closer to my home!"}
{"text":"Love love love the plant decor here! Very tropical vibe. Food is good too! I'm from Florida and I must say this is some of the best Arizona bbq I've had in the 4 years I've been here. We had the hog heaven platter. We chose baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, pulled pork, brisket, Mac and cheese, corn and potato salad...  all of it was delicious! I just had to add a bit of salt to the sides. The meats were tender and we were told they are slow cooked for 22 hours. For dessert we had the banana cream and the flavors in that dessert were heavenly! The coconut was unexpected but delicious! Service was great and I loved the decor. 2 of us split the platter. We ate all the sides, but we had a ton of leftover meat to take home."}
{"text":"This place was great. The food and drinks were great and it had a fun atmosphere. It seemed like a chain type place but the food quality was surprisingly good. Those donuts they give you at the end of the meal are heaven in a bag! I will def. be back."}
{"text":"First time visit and we LOVED every bite! They serve complimentary corn bread which was tasty, unfortunately (trying to cut carbs!) Lots of beers on tap and wines by the glass. But, oh my! The BBQ was amazing!! I had a brisket sandwich without the bun and a salad as my side. The salad was HUGE! I expected about 1/3 the size.  The lettuce was actually CRISP!!  The brisket was So tender and flavorful! I should have taken 1/2 home as it was a huge serving. Hubby had pulled pork and the beans! Wonderful. Sasuces were tasty too. They served FRESH donuts for dessert (for free). OMG--- i cant come back!!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Arizona for 10+ years and I can say that I am upset I waited so long to try this bbq. I am glad they opened a east valley location I never heard good things about the other location which is probably why I never went.   Their food is really good I tried their chicken a few times and can say only one time that I was not impressed it was a little dry.   The wait - expect to wait if you do not make a reservation. Or you can do open lounge seating I have yet to try that. The thought of eating bbq while lounging im not convinced.   Their staff is really good you can tell they are use to the fast pace and do fairly well keeping up. They seemed to be staffed appropriately.   Price indeed is a bit much expect to pay about $30 a person"}
{"text":"This was excellent. The service was superior and very attentive. It looks this place should be the beach. It gives that waterfront feeling. The strawberry lemonade was too sweet. Everything was good. No regrets!"}
{"text":"Best ribs, brisket, and cornbread Ive ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Celina was an awesome waitress! Food was fantastic atmosphere was so cozy would definitely  back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!! Happy Hour is on point from 2pm-6pm with beef sliders and those delicious shoe string fries, to brisket  taco and nachos. Have a seat at the bar or in their comfy couch/chair lounge area.  You will definitely go home smelling like BBQ:) Service is wonderful everyone is so on point and always attentive."}
{"text":"First time here. It was packed even at 8pm. We sat in the lounge area. The atmosphere was great! It's a little bit pricey, but overall a pretty good value. Tried the baby back ribs, St. Louis style ribs, pork, brisket, cornbread, Mac and cheese, corn, and fries. They also have these little donuts while you wait. It was all pretty good. I didn't care for the st Louis style ribs.  The flavor was good, but didn't like the texture. I wish the sauce had a little more kick to it as well. I am used to famous daves. In comparison, I like famous daves a little better for the actual BBQ. I love Bobby q's for the atmosphere. It's like an upscale BBQ joint."}
{"text":"We came here last Wednesday with a family member from out of town, we have eaten at the original location before and loved it so we were hoping that this location closer to home now would be just as good and it did not disappoint. Everyone loved their meals so much, I am newly vegan for health reasons and so it was hard to order anything for myself besides a salad but it was a good sized salad and they were very nice about making sure it did not have cheese on it and the right kind of dressing. I know the sauce is amazing so maybe they could add a portabella mushroom burger to the menu??! Service is always the best you will ever get, it was packed with graduation parties but we were served quickly and never needed to ask for a re-fill. I just really love the consistency for both locations, we will always come here for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I ordered the brisket plate with mac and cheese on the lunch menu one evening. Great portion and great price! The meat was perfect, moist and I enjoyed the perfect amount of smokiness! The mac and cheese was very good and rich. My favorite thing by far was the corn bread cakes, I love corn bread and this is now my favorite from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Bobby Q's - been there 3 times and wonderful experience every time!!! Spare Ribs are excellent!!! Customer Service is Excellent here!!!! Bit pricey but worth every penny of it for what you get - go to Bobby Q's!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Our entire table had: loaded potato with beef brisket- beef and was super tender and full of flavor. Baby back ribs- amazingly fall off the bone tender meat. Prime rib- my husband said this was the best prime rib he had ever had. Pulled pork sandwich was really good too. Kids hamburger was ok. Kids chicken strips were very good and seemed to be hand breaded and fried to order (not your normal frozen and fried type). Mark was our waiter. It was his first night and he did an amazing job. My only issue was the wait time to get our food. It took 45 minutes from the time we ordered for the food to arrive at the table. Oh and the cornbread is to die for!!!!! Great job Bobby-Q!!! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Some of the best barbecue I have ever had. Our server Jesus was very helpful as to what we should order so we got everything we wanted. Great place to have barbecue."}
{"text":"A tad pricey...No appetizers or sandwiches for under 10 bucks. BBQ sauce is a 7/10. I asked for the spicy sauce and it had no kick to it! The positive aspect is that my brisket sandwich had such a generous portion of meat that it was enough for two meals(or people). Ultra-fast take out service."}
{"text":"I love that you can make reservations at this place.  I would suggest you do so if you want to avoid the wait...because it is so good there is a wait!  We are from Texas and had a hard time finding a good barbecue joint.  Here it is in the Mesa Bobby Q!"}
{"text":"Excellent bbq!  My family came here for a birthday celebration and it was great. Loved the atmosphere, service was good, food tasted great and my kids loved the donuts at the end. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Made reservation through Yelp and glad I did. Very busy but when seated service was excellent. We were there for my husband's birthday. So much more than a bbq place. Food was outstanding.  Nice cake served for husbands birthday. Great surprise with   the fresh donuts they send home with you. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great beef ribs & flavorful brisket with good texture.  This is one of the best spots in Phoenix metro for bbq.  The 3 meat combo is an excellent value.  They have 2 moscato wines as options that are outstanding!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to come back that I might not even leave.  So full, so happy!  Our server Justin was awesome and very helpful.  Manager Jake has the place running smoothly and the kitchen is cooking some delicious bbq.  Beer list was great and the aesthetics of the restaurant were impressive.  Try the brisket it's fantastic."}
{"text":"As I continue to visit the Phoenix area, I still can't figure out what food is unique to this area. This trip it looks like barbecue is the new rage here. I came to this place as it was top rated. The meal was ok, I had the pork and brisket. Brisket was well trimmed for those who think brisket should have no fat. All in all it was just ok, definitely not cattle belt quality, but passable. Restaurant was clean, service was good, nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and excellent waitstaff are a total winner here. Everyone was friendly and helpful. We sat on the patio and the heaters kept us perfectly comfortable. Now, if only the food was on par with the setting and staff. Unfortunately, everything was just \"ok\". *We did not try the brisket and apparently that is their specialty, so that's awesome. The baby back ribs have a cooked-on bbq sauce that is both two sweet and too salty. It's overpowering. At some point I realized I couldn't taste the meat at all. Likewise, the beans were too sweet (and is that whiskey in there?), the mac n' cheese is too sharp, the salad was boring. Personally, I feel like let meat be meat, beans be beans, and add sugar/spice to compliment, not overpower. All that said, I'm really rooting for this place because the atmosphere and the attitude of the staff is WAY beyond the norm. I would go back just to have drinks with friends, maybe to watch a game (the tv's are perfectly placed.. not obnoxious, but easy to watch if you want to). The place just has a really nice, friendly vibe. Would be a great place for a holiday-time dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant hit so far above my expectations. The service was beyond amazing, especially our server (shoutout to Morgan ). She was laid back and fun but still SO professional. All other passing staff were observant of empty dishes or trash to be cleared. Everyone answered our questions and gave great food/cocktail recommendations. The ambiance is stunning with incredible attention to detail. Different areas, including a sexy bar/lounge, a larger family-style dining room, and two distinct patios, allow for many different dining experiences. Now, the food...GET THE Q-ROLLS! I literally drooled on myself eating them. The meats were all amazing, and I recommend a side of Q-lina sauce. We tried the mashed potatoes, Cole slaw, Mac and cheese, and potato salad as our sides. All four were amazing!!! And if you like Old Fashions, theirs is smoky and smooth perfection! At the end of the meal they hooked us up with what can only be described as the love child of a churro and a donut  pI will 100% be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow is this place good or what?! I've lived in the South and I am pretty good at barbecue and preparing smoked meat. While I still think I cook the best ribs, these guys are definitely worth trying. The combo platter will serve between two and four people is a great way to get to know the place. I've been back a couple of times. I've recommended these guys. Every time I mention their name to someone, if they've heard of Bobby Qs, they agree with me. Great food, good prices nice atmosphere. If you're thinking about barbecue tonight, drive the extra distance and try Bobby Qs."}
{"text":"One of a kind for Mesa/Chandler. Really awesome atmosphere, from the intimate patio to the social lounge to the bar and restaurant this place is the spot no matter your mood. The menu is not just BBQ...it is insanely delicious BBQ. And also includes amazing sandwiches, steaks and starters. Love this place for dinner or just to stop in for drinks!!!"}
{"text":"Dalton our waiter gave us awesome service. the brisket dinner was the best and the fresh made donuts are yummy. I will be going to this place every week for sure."}
{"text":"We made our way to Bobby Q's tonight for the first time. All in all, it's a good place: tasty food, good-sized portions, and excellent service.   The Q Rolls are basically egg rolls stuffed with brisket, served with dipping sauce. They were nothing too exciting, but nevertheless, quite good. My son and I had the pulled pork sandwich- I liked the toasted bun, along with the great tasting pork. For the sides, our table had shoestring fries, mac-n-cheese, beans, and corn bread: all delicious. Of course, freebie cinnamon sugar donuts at the end of any meal are always welcome.   Alex was a friendly and knowledgeable server, and several other team members took care of us as well. It's a good idea to make a reservation-this is quite the popular place."}
{"text":"Went in with my Wife and split a Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was $12 with a side of Fries, but  the Server (Demetri) was Fantastic, and brought us a basket with great Cornbread.  This was our first visit, but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Emily provided us with great service.  Excellent food!  Great atmosphere!  The queso dip is a little small as in portion size but delicious!  Put a fully loaded sweet potato on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love the food here!  Beef brisket is tasty and tender!  Macaroni and cheese is heavenly creamy!!  The service was spot on!"}
{"text":"The Q rolls are out of this world. Amazing. Great service. Friendly servers and team. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in the state!!! Everything is delicious I have yet to eat something here I haven't liked."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of BBQ and do a fair amount of it at home.  I was definitely not impressed.  Everything had a strange aftertaste... not sure if it was exhaust or something got into the smoker.  Even that issue (a pretty big issue) aside, the overall quality was mediocre at best (probably on par with Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert)... rub/seasoning was weak.  Would not recommend to anyone who really likes BBQ."}
{"text":"Great food and service once you get over the outside smell of a slaughterhouse!!!!! Girls night turned out more expensive than planned as all our shoes were ruined by film on asphalt that smelled of said slaughterhouse.  Drove back to hotel barefoot with all shoes in trunk.  Don't mind the smell of \"money\", as we called it growing up in IOWA, but not at a restaurant."}
{"text":"S. Taylor was great... greeted us with a smile cool shirt by the way,.. serve wAs awesome nothing but good things to say left with a full tummy and smiles on my way out by the hostess. Will be back"}
{"text":"Everything we got on the menu is absolutely amazing, the drinks are good the pulled pork is phenomenal the appetizer was amazing as well and the service was great we will definitely be coming back! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Me: So I love the design of this place--the high rafters and the wooden beams.   Craig: Yes. And the music isn't too loud.   Me: Good point. I mean, it's country, but you kind of come in expecting that, right?  Craig: You do.   Me: At least it's not right in your face, which I appreciate.   Craig: I also like the booth. It's very private--good for conversation.   Me: Me too, and the whole ambience is kind of laid back and mellow. It's got a cool vibe.   Craig: It seems like the kind of place that would serve good bbq.   Me: But the question is, does it?  Craig: I enjoyed the pulled pork, but the bun fell apart. It would've better if it were toasted.   Me: My bun was fine, but I think I added my extra bbq sauce more gradually than you did, so it didn't get as soggy.   Craig: Yeah, I added mine all at once.   Me: The meat was very good, but not the best I've had. The potato salad was pretty good, but I thought your mac and cheese tasted too much like American cheese. I like high quality cheese.   Craig: I liked it, but it was too gooey and velveeta-y. I'd get the fries next time instead.   Me: The cornbread was pretty good, but I like a crispier crust.   Craig: It did taste good, but it was too soft. The donut was tasty.   Me: Hot damn! The free donuts they surprised us with at the end were great. No need to get dessert. It tasted like a churro. Yum! Service was also very good--friendly and prompt. So how would you rate this?  Craig: I think it's a 3-star.  Me: Really? That's it?   Craig: Well, 3 1/2, but you can't do halves.   Me: I would give it at least 4. I think the donuts push it to a 4.  Craig: Okay, I'd buy into that."}
{"text":"This is the best Q in the earth.We have it every day..God bless this place.Goood prices and things jumpen off"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times. Love the bbq platter. Plenty of food for me and my family. Love the free donuts at the end. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ! I already want to come eat here again. We went out to eat with some friends last night and had a great time. Our server recommended some food for us to try and told us about how they cook their meat, etc. We had some drinks (great beer and margaritas), delicious cornbread/dinner and little donuts that were still hot when we got them! I love the atmosphere at this restaurant, it's so fun and pretty! I got the loaded baked potato with brisket and roasted corn which was huge, had leftovers for lunch today. The others got ribeye steaks and baby back ribs which they loved. Very friendly/fun place to eat!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome place great service and top notch food would definitely be worth a visit"}
{"text":"I must say that while I love Booby Q's in Phoenix, the one in Mesa was just awful. Cold food. Bad service. Most everything that could go wrong did. For sure we will NOT be back."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and enjoy everything from the cornbread to their awesome ribs. This is one place that rarely disappoints and will go out of their way to make it right.  Definitely one of our favorites go to places.  Highly recommend a reservation on the weekends,  popular place that gets busy."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and found Bobby-Q on Yelp.  We are always up for a good BBQ joint so we opted to have date night here while the rest of our group went to a chain nearby...they sure missed out!  We had a fantastic meal.  The brisket is very tender and moist and our sides were some of the best we have had in a while.  Particularly the mac n cheese was so creamy and cheesy.  Our server was a gem, the manager was walking around to all the tables checking in on diners and the vibe was great.  The ambiance of the restaurant is hip but understated and not trying too hard.  There are some really neat design elements including the Bobby-Q pick up truck parked in the parking lot.  We split a sandwich and sides so ended up ordering apple cobbler, definitely a winner.  To top it off, they give you mini cinnamon sugar donuts with your check.  So extra!"}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue food and good service throughout the meal.  Had whole hog platter with brisket, pork, and babyback ribs. Would have fed four, plenty to spare between 3 of us. Come early or make a reservation as this place gets very busy!!"}
{"text":"Being from KC I'm a bit of a BBQ snob. I don't try to be, but I am. I've been underwhelmed my 6 yrs here. With that being said, this is my favorite BBQ in AZ. Spicy sauce, smoked chicken wings, sausage & brisket were really good. We are coming back for smoked prime rib. Staff was friendly & environment was amazing. Brandon was knowledgeable & took great care of us. Thank you & we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm going to spin a tale of reversal. (But if you're in a hurry: Bobby Q's is good; you should go; ask for Dusty and get the Q rolls.)  Bobby Q's came as a pleasant surprise about a week ago. The wife and I were looking for a happy hour place following a couple difficult days at work. You know the type of day, the kind where you're just holding on, fighting to stave off the onset of full-on grouchiness... and def predisposed to irritability. We stumbled on Bobby Q's.   We were greeted at the door and shown to a table in the bar. I requested we move to a table that had a view of one of the TVs. Irritability index +1 (I'm not always this way. I'm just accurately describing the situation.) We were shown to another table, TV-adjacent. Yay.  We were seated by Dusty and she was also our server. She brought me a beer and my wife a glass of Chard. She recommended the Q Rolls from the appetizer menu. We ordered those and got a Platter Sampler order in just under the 4 pm wire for the lunch pricing. We were already taking shine to Dusty (who shall henceforth be referred to as The Wonderful Dusty).   The Q Rolls came. 180° shift in the day's events. These things are like smokey BBQ egg rolls, sans veggies. They come with tasty BBQ sauce and a chipotle dip. I'm gonna go with scrumptious. Yup, they were scrumptious.   And then The Wonderful Dusty brought the Platter Sampler (Ribs, Prime Brisket, and Pork, with beans and cornbread). Happy. Bad day receding in the wake of barbeque deliciousness. The meats were tender and heavenly. And the cornbread... oh my, it was the cornbreadiest cornbread I have ever had. It was so good that it started a bizarre chess match to politely consume to the most of it between Darcie and me.   So, my wife and I worked food service in our distant pasts. We know the rarity and value of positive comments (perhaps this has changed with the advent of Yelp... reflection required). Anyway, I asked The Wonderful Dusty to have her manager stop by so we could talk about how awesome she is. The manager stopped by, we extolled the magnificent amazingness of The Wonderful Dusty.  I think what I actually said was:  \"We like to acknowledge when we have been astonished and thank those responsible. Everything exceeded expectations, from our bright and personable server to the excellent BBQ. Thank you and we are telling everyone, our friends, Yelp, and, over the next few days, random street folk and passersby.\"  Dude was a bit of a wet blanket. Had that thinly veiled why-ya-botherin-me look. I'd cut him some slack that he might have been busy, but Darcie and I were 2 of the 7 customers in the place. Not certain how to advise you amigo/damp-blanket. Maybe show some interest when a customer reaches out to thank you for a job well-done... ask a few questions, engage in some brief small talk. Value your customers. You'll get it. But you blew the fifth star bro. We'll be back.  Every now and then you have a meal that sticks in your memory in the best ways possible. To The Wonderful Dusty, the Bobby Q's kitchen staff, the Q Rolls, the amazing Platter Sampler, and the most radiant cornbready awesomeness... WE THANK YOU.  Day saved by Bobby Q.  We can't wait to return with friends."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ I've ever had in my life including the BBQ I make.   I had the two meat plate brisket and St Louis ribs with a loaded baked potato and mac & cheese.  Cornbread was also brought out.   We also tried their smoked corn and Q rolls.  Everything was AMAZING, Smokey and delicious.  Mac and cheese coated my mouth like the old school mac did growing up.   I wanted to cry with joy while eating this meal.   They even gave us free donuts when we left after we were in a food coma.  Ask for an extra side of BBQ sauce as they'll give you options.   Service was great and this is now my last meal on earth request.   Where is the 10 star button?!  Thank you will be back numerous times as this place does it right."}
{"text":"Just as good as the original.  I can't say enough good things about Bobby Qs. They have the best brisket I've ever had. The fries are always crispy. The mac and cheese is always creamy. The corn is just great.   Plus the free donuts with your bill are tasty.  Do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"This is by far the best bar b que place I have ever been to. The ribs are amazing, the pulled pork excellent. Alyssa our waitress was wonderful, knowledgeable and had great recommendations on the food. Will definitely be back again to try the other menu options. Great food at a great price."}
{"text":"First time coming in to Bobby-Q and it was great!! Food was served very quickly, and our waitress, Ashlynn was awesome! Loved the vibe in the restaurant, and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Wow. Best beef brisket sandwich I've ever had, or pretty close. Try it with the pecan coleslaw. It's slightly citrus, super crisp, and the toasted pecans give it an extra something special in your mouth. Sooo good."}
{"text":"First of all, the service was excellent. Didn't lack for anything all evening. The reservation--and I do recommend getting a reservation--went withhout a hitch. Was given a choice of dining room, bar patio table, or dining room patio. I chose dining room patio.   We were entertaining friends from out of state. Eveyrbody really enjoyed their food and was so happy that we came here. One in our party had the pulled pork, two had the baby back ribs, one had a filet mignon, another had the roast chicken, and I had the two rib plate which is two half racks of your choice of St. Louis, baby backs, or beef ribs. I chose the St. Louis and baby back.  Talk about great BBQ! The meat from my ribs fell off of the bone. Both were tender, smoked right, and had a wonderful flavor. And here, a whole rack of ribs is a whole rack, not some small rack that you get at other places. I was stuffed with only eating a half a rack. That's OK, though, as the left overs were so good the next day.  Everyone scarfed down the round corn bread cakes. Butter was sufficient and honey couldn't have improved the flavor and moistness. My side of mac & cheese was absolutely yummy. You could come here just for that. Creamy and cheesy with a perfect flavor. My roast corn was good.  I didn't like the lemonade. It tasted no better than Minute Maid (yuck).   The complementary mini donuts were absolutely terrific. Wish I wasn't as full at that point to have more.  I love the exterior. It looks like an expensive ranch house. Plants and landscaping make it comfortable.  Some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Bring your BBQ hankerings here, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"YUMMO!!  Came here a couple weeks ago with my husband for an impromptu lunch date. It was our first visit and we can't wait to come back. Our server was the best we've had anywhere in a really long time. She walked us through the menu, made some fantastic recommendations, (HEEEEEEELLO Q ROLLS) and provided top notch service the entire time. The food was some of the best we've had (sorry my dad smokes his own meats so I can't say yours is the best...wink, wink)  ;0)   And to finish it all off, we were given a bag of warm, cinnamon/sugar coated mini donuts to enjoy for the car ride home!! This is something my dad seriously needs to consider, he does not send me home with warm mini donuts haha. All in all 5 stars from start to finish. It's a bit of a hike for us, since we are in Cave Creek but we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Really love the inside of this place and the bar section , really thought all the TVs were awesome , food was excellent and service was spot on. Totally coming back"}
{"text":"Very rarely do I give a 5 star rating but this place gave me no choice! The moment we arrived we were impressed by the ambience. The staff were nice and seemed to like where they worked which is always a plus. The server we got was nice as well. I couldn't decide what to order as my cocktail but the lemon drop I decided on was delicious. My husband loved his strawberry margarita and moms cosmo was great too. The food ohhhhh oh the food! First the sauce they use called \"regular\" BBQ was perfect sweet and flavored not just sugary. The brisket and ribs were definitely marinated to perfection and was falling apart from tenderness. The sausage was smoked and the flavor was a party in your mouth! The corn was sweet and buttery. The Mac N cheese was like momma makes in the south. The cornbread was sweet and buttery. The baked potato... how did they make a baked potato so good I have no clue! Everything was the best of its kind and fresh we were all in heaven. The manager even came to greet us and was very approachable. He was helping staff clear tables checking on guests and seemed to love what he does as well. After all the amazing ness we experienced to top it all off the gave free Togo homemade doughnuts and military discount.... this is our new favorite place and we will be spreading the word. Some places expect tips but this place earns it they model excellence here! Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Service was fine.  Thinking I need to order more than a salad for future- if we try this place again.  Restaurant was semi busy so not sure."}
{"text":"Went to Bobby Q for a wedding rehearsal dinner it was great that they could accommodate a party of  45 people food is awesome brisket u could cut with a plastic spoon so tender,rib meat falls off the bone the smokeness is perfect, cornbread is soft and not dried out you gotta have tons of Mac n cheese and best of all staff is super drinks never went empty"}
{"text":"Taylor and our server took excellent care of our party of 8 and made our dining experience one to remember! I'd highly recommend Bobby Q's for their great food, atmosphere and amazing hospitality! Thank you!"}
{"text":"A large bustling BBQ restaurant just off the highway in Mesa surrounded by dozens of large chain restaurants.  I chose this spot based on the super strong reviews and was a little disappointed when I saw what looked like a large chain restaurant bustling with hundreds of diners as I was hoping for a small artisanal joint but hey, we are in the suburbs after all. Turns out this is one of only two locations and as our waitress schooled us, one that has gotten lots of foodie accolades.  We were seated a bit late for our 6 pm reservation after waiting for a few minutes in the crowded lobby but were given a nice cozy booth in the bar area.  As we watched the huge platters of food going by at this bustling spot, we opted to share something for dinner. The menu features all the BBQ classics including ribs (baby back, St. Louis or beef), brisket, chicken and more mostly in the $20-25 price range.  Most BBQ entrees come with the choice of two sides (potatoes: mashed, baked or shoestring, mac and cheese, pecan coleslaw, beans, roasted corn and more). Your meal starts with warm, crumbly hockey puck-sized corn bread and whipped butter. This is a LOT of food.  We opted to share the two meat combo choosing brisket and ribs, coleslaw and fries.  The food came out after a reasonable wait and the kitchen was kind enough to split things up for us in the back.  We each had plenty to eat.  So, why the mediocre review?  For me the taste and quality of the food was good but not great.  Despite the slow cooking, the two meats we chose were very fatty and the BBQ sauce was very ordinary to my tastes. The crispy fries were good as was the coleslaw while the corn bread was nothing special.  Clearly this place is a hit as it was packed with people and due to the large food portions, a great value and seemed to be doing well at this suburban location.  There was even a Texas road House directly across the street (similarly sized chain).  I guess in the end it was just not my kind of place."}
{"text":"We were in the are of the Bobby Q and was looking for a place to eat.  We had never been there before but decided to give it a try.  We were extremely pleased with the quality of the food, the speedy service and the friendly staff. My wife had BBQ Ribs and I had the Smoked Beef Brisket.  Both were excellent and we can't wait to return and try some other dishes.   It is now on our list of good places to dine and have recommended to our friends to give it a try."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first visit for my wife and I. We were very impressed with the quality of the food. The waitress was friendly and informative, and we left stuffed. We were served free cornbread before our meal, and it was very fresh and warm. For dinner we enjoyed a loaded baked potato with brisket and a brisket sandwich. The meat was slow-cooked for 18 hours and literally fell apart in our mouths. It was amazing. If you're looking for a great BBQ spot, Bobby Qs is your place to go."}
{"text":"Second time here and last!! Prices are way too high compared to other places and the service is dennys style service with no class! High scottsdale prices and dennys style service, few other places i can think of and less expensive!"}
{"text":"Love that cornbread and the pulled pork sandwich. Yum!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Busy place. Great decor, clean restroom. Nice menu. Food delicious. Service fast and pleasant. Screwed up our order slightly but fixed quickly. Loved the cozy furniture and little donuts! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food and service very good!! However our waiter was unsure of his products! I asked what seasoning was on the fries he had no idea!"}
{"text":"I played it smart and dropped in to Bobby Q on a sat. 3pm .....a month before mesa goes snowbird crazy. Yes...snowbird crazy where eating anywhere is almost impossible. You would never know this place has been open for just a week. Very nice inside although the street noise is obvious and cant be drowned out by their very loud water feature inside. I had the catfish sandwich which was delicious, flakey fish, on great bread and a good portion @12.00 and  recommended. The mac n cheese, corn bread,beans and donuts were also spot on.  Here's where the bbq game loses me.....it is crazy expensive and the portions are questionable. My wife had the 2 meat combo. So...2 small lumps of pork n chicken shredded bbq/ beans/ mac n cheese. 22.00? Not in any way a value but was tastey.  Mixed drinks......we are now in the 11.00 to 15.00 cost bracket for a foo foo drink. When your drink is more than your entree....well..you know.  Morgan was a polite, good server and was on point. In the end, go and grab a burger 14.00or fish sandwich with a few cokes to be reasonable 30.00+ or drink and BBQ for about 75.00 + per couple. BOBBY Q's is out of my weekly budget for a local, weekly eatery but its food and nicely appointed establishment speaks for itself. Maybe for special occasions.  Ps.....its buried at the end of an endless line of parking lots behind a dozen businesses so there will be snowbird grid lock and bang ups in that parking lot come Nov. GUARANTEED.....you have been warned!  SECOND VISIT : I had their smokehouse burger and it was over the top delicious! Seriously one of my top 5 burgers and one i would consider gourmet. A huge patty......great bacon, onion strips and cheese.  Well worth every penny of 14.00 Great job Bobby Q's !"}
{"text":"We went to dinner last night omg it was so yummy!!! The waitress was great Wish I caught her name... we had never been before so she explained everything to us. I asked about how fatty the brisket was she said she'll make sure it's lean for me the big pineapple drink was amazing and corn bread was great !! I got the brisket and baby back ribs the meat was so lean I didn't see fat at all. I appreciate she actually got me lean meat!!! We will be back this is my new BBQ place ... thank you for the great service and amazing food"}
{"text":"The food is fine.  The corn bread they bring to the table early is very good.  The donuts the bring at the end are fabulous.  It seems a little pricey to me, but with the corn bread and donuts maybe it evens out.  I would consider going back and trying it again, especially if I had a coupon."}
{"text":"The food is really, really good. The first time we ate at Bobby Q's we were doing tastings for my daughter's wedding. We were at the Phoenix location and they brought a sampling of all of their most popular dishes. We booked with them as soon as we were done trying it! They catered the wedding and the food was incredible. Initially the guests were saying things like \"BBQ at a wedding? Eww.\" But by the end of the reception they were telling me it was the best wedding food they've ever had. We had special wedding bibs for everyone and there was plenty of food! I've since visited the new Mesa location several times and just made reservations for Mother's Day. Hard to believe this is the same owner as Bobby McGees! Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The q rolls and donuts they bring at end of the meal are awesome!!  We had the feast meal it was ok sides were ok as well.  Not the best but ok."}
{"text":"Unfortunately wasn't impressed with the food or service, won't return back. Food was greasy, bartender was not quick to greet or take our order. The host staff was more interested in tattoos and piercings then customer service."}
{"text":"Great service greaat food, would love more low carb sides."}
{"text":"Very yummy! Food and service were excellent!"}
{"text":"Loved the Bbq. Service was quick and friendly. Highly recommend the baby back ribs, the pecan cole slaw and the sausage."}
{"text":"FAN-DANG-TASTIC !!!   Wow, am I glad I bookmarked this place to try during our weekend stay in the Tempe area!  This place was just terrific.   Interesting ambiance, a hoping bar, a fantastic menu and absolutely TOP-NOTCH service.  We could not ask for more!   We were lucky enough to have Amber S. for our server on a busy Friday night but she took the time to carefully explain Bobby's menu and how it all works and we were NOT disappointed!   We ordered iced tea ($2), a Coke ($2.50) an order of Q Rolls ($12.00), the Whole Hog Heaven ($51) and one additional side ($4) so we would have an even number.  WOW OH WOW !!!!!   The Q Rolls were amazing!  They were like brisket filled thick taquitos with two yummy sauces.  YUM YUM YUM !!  For the Whole Hog, we chose Baby Back and St Louis Style ribs (6 bones each), for the two meat choices - Brisket and Pulled Pork (huge amount!) and for the sides, mac n cheese, pecan cole slaw, mashed potatoes and then we added a side of ranch beans.  EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!  They also provide complimentary corn bread and butter (they are served in these interesting circular shapes) and at the end of the meal, a little bag of cinnamon and sugar donuts!  INCREDIBLE !!     We are two huge eaters with no shame but even we think this was too much food for two people.  What a happy problem to have.  The only place in So Cal we can compare this to is Famous Dave's and at Bobby Q's, you get WAY MORE for your money.  WAY MORE.   We cannot wait to come back.  Thank you, Amber S for the great service !!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. We have never had anything here we didn't like or wouldn't order again. Everything is so good. Our favorites are the brisket quesadilla, smokehouse burger, Mac and cheese and the big blue van beer. They have a lounge area you can sit in and order drinks and appetizers until your table is ready. It's a bit pricey but it's worth it. Definitely one of our favorite places for a date night."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a place to eat steaks for a while.  Thank goodness for Bobby Q!  The BBQ is tasty and the steaks are juicy and cooked to perfection.  If I would have reviewed the restaurant on our first visit, I would have given it 4 stars because of the service.  It took our server 4 trips to our table to tell us what kind of local beer they had and then left us hanging for our order for another 2 trips.  On our next visit our server was very attentive and didn't fail in any aspect of the service.  I think Bobby Q is our place to eat BBQ and Steak from now on! :)  (DON'T FORGET THE LITTLE DOUGHNUTS THEY GIVE OUT AT THE END OF THE MEAL!  THEY ARE DELISH!)"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed lunch here. My wife and I shared a full rack of baby back ribs . Super tender and good flavor without a lot of fat. The sauce that came on the ribs was ok, but I preferred the side of Carolina style sauce (vinegar based). Great atmosphere, nice vibe without being loud. Service was outstanding. Our waiter, Garrett, was fantastic and took great care of us. Will be back to try the St Louis style ribs and the piled pork."}
{"text":"This place is legit! My wife and I've tales about going to the West Valley location before but just never made the drive. This weekend, enjoyed my first experience at their new East Valley location. WOW!  Had a 3-meat combo with fries and macaroni. All the meats were amazing - moist, flavorful and overall delicious. Fries were just ok. Macaroni was super cheesy and tasty. Cornbread beforehand was fantastic. To top it all off, they brought us hot, mini-donuts at the end of the meal. AMAZING!  I had leftovers today for lunch and it tasted just as good the 2nd time around."}
{"text":"Greeeeeeeaaaaaat! Food and service experience! We had Fried Catfish! My sides were pecan coleslaw and Mac n cheese! All food temps on point and fish cooked crisp and very well seasoned! Loved it! AWSOME!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bbq place in AZ so far!  From the food the the service they are amazing !"}
{"text":"OH my Gahhhhhhhhhhd!!!  I don't even know where to start. So amazingly tasty. Pulled pork is so goooood, it will make you wanna slap yo momma!  We will come back as much as possible."}
{"text":"Just as good as the one in Phoenix.  Now we don't have to drive as far.   A super plus for all of us East Valley residents.   Their Baby Back are my fave.  And I love the little donuts for the kids."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Bobby Q's for an impromptu \"date lunch\". We had the Friday fish fry special, BBQ chicken sandwich and the Bobby Salad. The food was very good. Though the complimentary cornbread and donuts were the stars of our meal.  If I could rate the food and service independently, I would give the service a 5. Our server, Jesus said he was new, but you would never know. His attention to detail, thoroughness and knowledge was impeccable.  It's rare to have such a great and attentive server. Bobby Q's should be proud to have him representing their brand and I would go back for the service alone."}
{"text":"Garrett our server was awesome!!! Amazing service and good food! The cornbread was delish along with the donuts!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the salt lick in texas but close second. The corn bread much better than texas white bread at salt lick. I loved the baby back ribs, Mac cheese, brisket, potato salad, corn, corn bread, Diet Coke.   Didn't love the mash potato and sausage very good just not my style.   And the fresh donuts worth a visit from miles away."}
{"text":"Took my wife here the other day and I was impressed by the food. The complimentary cornbread is sweet, yet has a hint of jalapeño - truly delicious. For an appetizer we had the smoked wings, which were large and came with ranch, bbq, and buffalo sauce for dipping. The flavor was great and they were filling. For dinner we each got sandwiches. I went with the pork, which was juicy and tender and my wife had the pulled chicken, which was also a delight. The buns were tasty and the meat was on point. They bring you an assortment of sauces to try and I enjoyed all but the one that had too much vinegar for my taste.   My wife had a drink that came in a pineapple (can't remember the name) which was pretty tasty. I had an old fashioned, but it was far too sweet for my taste.   After the food we had little room for dessert so the server bagged up some free sugar donuts for us. These were out of this world! They also have a neat machine up front so you can see the employees making them -Adds to the ambiance!   The restaurant was dimly lit and quite crowded, looked to be an older crowd with lots of kids, but it's the holidays so that may not be the usual demographic.   I'll be back to try to sampler platter!!"}
{"text":"So good!!!!!!!  Their cornbread to start off the meal is delish. I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and was half expecting it to be dry (because many times, chicken is!)... But no. It was delicious, succulent, juicy chicken. I ordered the potato salad as my side dish and it might be the best potato salad I've ever had.   My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich and equally loved it.   They have 3 different BBQ sauces... A regular, a spicy, and a tangy Carolina one I believe? The regular is basic and good. The spicy isn't really spicy at all. I really loved the tangy Carolina one!!  The complimentary sugared donuts at the end were yummy too. Overall, a great experience!!"}
{"text":"I am torn between 3 and 4 stars. This was my very first visit to this highly recommended establishment. My family raved positives when I said I wanted to treat everyone to dinner while I visited from out of town. If I was rating the food I would give 4.5 stars because the end of meal donuts were clearly not fresh but everything else was phenomenal. However, the service would get 2 stars. She was friendly when she was around but everything took far too long from the perspective of someone who bartended and served all through college.  Drinks were empty too often and bar drinks took longer than the appetizers.  We were not even offered another round. The cornbread was forgot more than once and I actually had to get up from the table to ask for plates when it finally arrived. It also took at least 15 minutes for the 1 check after it was requested. I felt like we received below average service because we were a party of 8 and therefore the check had an autogratuity on it. That should not affect service and in reality the waitress did not get any additional tip from someone who has been in the industry and regularly tips above 20% on the post tax ammount for appropriate service and care. All in all I am willing to try it again in hopes that this was a fluke because the food was so good."}
{"text":"My grand daughter and I had lunch here today.  The menu had so many choices and the special for the day was fish but we chose the brisket sandwich.  She had potato salad as the side and I had the French fries.  They brought corn bread and butter that was delicious.  The sandwich was piled with barbecue beef and sauce.  Neither one of us could eat the full sandwich.  The service was great.  Our waiter Andre was the best.  He gave us the run down on all the different choices with recommendations.  And the home made donuts they gave us melted in your mouth.  I certainly plan on going back and hope to get Andre as our waiter."}
{"text":"Ambience is very good, sat at the bar the service was outstanding. During happy hour a pitcher is $5 and a pint costs more. The pitcher is too cheap. I did not want 3 beers but wasted it. Food was good. I had the loaded baked potato, it was good but cost $12, pretty spendy. Anyway we like the place but feel the pricing needs work. Plan to return"}
{"text":"Bobby Q's won't disappoint. From the atmosphere to the food to the service. 4 stars all the way around. Donuts at the exit are excellent! Hot and fresh! They are the BOMB Now to my Dinner. The ribeye. Not the best but not the worst. I'd give it 3 out of 5 stars. The fresh and hot baked potato was great! And cornbread is very tasty. Here's wishing the water was filtered, because it tasted right from the city of Mesa public faucet. I'd definitely come back and get some BBQ on the next visit. Staff and Service was legit"}
{"text":"Came out here from Kansas City for vacation and wanted to try some Arizona BBQ, I was not disappointed!  Bobby-Q has some pretty amazing BBQ. I liked the sauce so much I bought a jug to bring home! Not only was the food great, the service was stellar as well. Top notch place to eat! Hats off to Bobby, and his manager in Mesa, Johnny!"}
{"text":"Someone recently asked me, \"What makes a four-star restaurant different than a five-star restaurant?\" After giving it some thought, I've concluded the following:  A true five-star dining experience is a place you can visit, where you can sit down and order a table-full of food and everything - yes, virtually EVERYTHING is good!  When I wrote my review of Bobby Q's I-17 location several months ago, I cited their spectacular food, thrown in with small touches that result in what I still feel is one of the truly best barbeque experiences you can find in Phoenix. Ironically, I also voiced that I was pleased that Bobby Q's was a single location that refused to branch out, ensuring that quality and consistency would be rigorously maintained. For this reason, I was a bit skeptical when I heard that owner, Bob Sikora, whose restaurant experience is quite a fascinating tale in and of itself, decided to open up a second location in Mesa.  The Mesa location looks and feels remarkably similar to the original, albeit slightly smaller in scale. All the familiar menu items are here, the heavy-wood and brick décor is present, and the quality of the food, thank goodness, is damn-near identical to what we've come to expect.  I cannot stress this enough. There are plenty of establishments in Phoenix that do barbeque well. Finding great meat has never been an issue. The problem is, that seems to be the only thing these places focus on. They place so much emphasis on the barbeque itself, that they merely \"tack on\" the sides, as if they're red-headed stepchildren that they're forced to deal with, not by desire, but by mere force. What makes Bobby Q's special is that, in addition to their phenomenal barbeque, their side dishes are all done to absolute perfection!  The Q-Rolls, stuffed with smoked brisket and served with chipotle sauce are an essential starter. Flavor comes out in full-force from your first bite. And the cornbread? You won't find any of those dried up muffins here. Their complimentary cornbread cakes are fresh, moist, sweet, and so delicious that we started requesting some extras to take home.  My girlfriend and I prefer our barbeque in pulled pork sandwich form. The smokey flavor offered here simply cannot be topped. Their mac and cheese is ultra-creamy, cheesy, and leagues above what you'd find at similar places. Even their fries and mashed potatoes impress, ensuring that \"complete\" experience of having a table full of great food, without any disappointments to be found.  The complimentary homemade donuts have also made the move as well. I see them as the perfect parting gift. Warm, fresh, and simple. How can you go wrong?  You can tell that this location still needs some additional time to \"break in\" in terms of service. We kind of helplessly stood around for several minutes, wondering where the hostess was until my girlfriend spoke up to one of the girls making donuts. I guess she temporarily zoned out. But aside from that little hiccup, the food was just as excellent as I had hoped. Even the manager stopped by and small talked with us for a bit.   I've said it before and I'll say it again. You might be able to find good barbeque in Phoenix - and I suppose that's enough to please most people. But if you want the full experience of not only spectacular barbeque, but sides and sweets that will knock your socks off, Bobby Q's is what I see as our city's true gold standard.  Highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"I really thought this place would be fantastic but didn't personally think so. We split the 3 meat platter with beef ribs, pork ribs and rotisserie chick with grilled veggies and corn and mac n cheese.  The beef ribs were stringy - about 4 ounces of total meat was available for consumption. The pork ribs were okay - but I expected them to be better than just okay after reading the reviews and seeing the prices. I'm more than happy to spend the price requested for the food (or even more) however I expect it to be delicious in exchange for that. I'm not much of a chef but have enjoyed the quality of meat and flavor from homemade crockpot ribs far more than anything I had here - with the exception of the donuts at the end of the meal.  The donuts are to die for. They are hot and freshly made."}
{"text":"Always great food& service everytime I come here...Garrett was our waiter and he was awesome!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has changed a few times over the years, now it's a BBQ restaurant. I like this place! The food is tasty, the server was good, and the inside and outside ambiance is great. I will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Be ready to wait no matter what you go there.  There are low tables in the back where you can sit if you don't mind eating like a hutch back.  The corn bread is flakey and doesn't even need butter. We got the big meat platter for 3 people to share we asked if that would enough food she said yes. She must eat like  bird the sides aren't even for each person to get one table spoon.  The meat portion was just enough for 2 people but it was a lot smaller than we thought. All of the meat was juicy and the bbq sauce was perfect the hot want even that hot for me and I don't do spicy"}
{"text":"Jennifer was amazing & attentive! This restaurant is delicious and everything was better than expected. Outstanding service. Will recommend."}
{"text":"Got the prime rib and catfish combo for the wife and I to split.   We both really liked it.  Great meal and experience."}
{"text":"There is no area in which this restaurant should not get a 5 star rating. Make the drive, go there. You will be glad! My waiter, Joe, was exceptional on all levels!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for an early dinner a bit ago. We were seated quickly and our waitress came and introduced herself immediately. She let us know she was brand new (1st night!). Honestly, if she hadn't told us that we never would have known. She was excellent and was on it.   My food was really good. I had the half chicken with mac and cheese and my husband had the prime rib. The chicken was really good, but I wish I would have gotten something else. It was smoked, so it had a really unique flavor, but we have a smoker so it was nothing special for me. My husbands prime rib was cooked the way he likes it (medium rare), which is surprisingly difficult to get a restaurant. He said the corn was awful and he couldn't eat it.  I thought that the mac and cheese was delightful! Super cheesy and rich, just the way mac and cheese should be. My husband, on the other hand, thought that it was just ok.  The reason for the 4 stars is that while I thought it was really good, I didn't feel like it was exceptionally good. My husband thought it was average at best.  All that said, I would probably come back if I was in the mood for some BBQ (but my husband wouldn't)!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and we waited only 5 minutes without getting attended and when they attended us they felt that they made us wait too long and they took the initiative and gave us a free appetizer, and the food suggestions of the waiter and the manager were great, their service is really good and the food was amazing. Best BBQ I've had in the PHX area."}
{"text":"First time here, on occasion of a co-worker's birthday. Will not be returning. Ordered a drink to start, and after waiting 20 minutes with nothing, took matters into my own hands and went to the bar to parch my thirst. Took forever to get our order in, and all members of party had been served before we even had our cornbread. Passed time by playing a game of speculation about what i did to piss our server off. Ordered a burger and fries, was assured multiple times that the fries were on their way. Didn't arrive until I had already finished my burger, and they were in-n-out quality (I think they ran across the way bc their fryer broke or something) Happy for the people who've had a positive experience at this place. If I wanted to be ignored and disrespected, I could have had stayed home, watched Stranger Things, and had my wife cook for me, amirite?"}
{"text":"Great yummy amazing food, & delicious drinks. Absolutely love the set up and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bobby Q was fantastic! All of the food was absolutely delicious. Our meal started out with complimentary cornbread in lieu of the traditional bread and butter, and it was wonderful. It was warm, fresh, and was a great way to start out the meal. I ordered the Sirloin steak (picture attached) that was cooked to perfection. A lot of chain restaurants that I've ordered steak from seem to either over or under cook the meat and I never really get it at the temperature I ordered it at. But the cook on the steak from Bobby Q's was exactly what I was hoping for!  Something I found very cool was the treat they give you to-go at the end of your meal, which is a bag of fresh doughnuts that they make at the front. They were delicious and such a creative way to top off a meal, especially for people who are too full to order desert.  My single, only complaint, was the service. The gentleman who served us was so nice and polite, however apparently they had cut a large amount of the servers off the floor when we got there, so the poor guy was running around the whole restaurant tending to different guests. He was behind the bar, across the building serving other tables, and sporadically with us. Since he was so busy, our drinks took a while to be refilled, getting refills on cornbread felt like it was a hassle to him, and our bill took FOREVER to be cashed out. I don't blame him personally for taking so long, but as a customer it wasn't the best service experience. But honestly it wasn't bad enough service that it completely ruined our meal, It was just a little longer than expected.   Overall it was a great dining experience and I absolutely recommend giving this place a try if you haven't, for their delicious food, huge menu selection, beautiful building, and full bar! Bobby Q's has something for everybody!"}
{"text":"I want to really like this place but when I first walked I had to walk past a bunch of smokers with my kids. They should think of moving the smoking area somewhere else. Then it smelled like a nursing home. One of the bathroom sinks didn't work, there was water all over the bathroom floor. Now the food, my husband's food made him sick to his stomach, he got a caesar salad to start has soon has he started eating it he said he it made him feel sick. So he had his entree put into to go box. Me and my kids got the Q-rolls and they were good. My kids enjoyed thier food. One got a kids cheese pizza which was big enough that they could have shared, and the other got the fried Chicken was she liked. My food I got the brisket and mac and cheese. The Mac was good just like homemade, the brisket had more fat then meat and was too smokey like a weird smoke flavor kinda chemically tasting. Probably won't try again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch yesterday while I was up in the Phoenix area for work.  I love BBQ, so when they suggested Bobby Q I was all in.   We don't have one of these in Tucson, nor was I aware they are a chain but I sure wish I had one close to home!   Service was solid and attentive.  They brought us these delicious little corn bread biscuits while we waited for our food.  We ordered off the lunch menu which was a great deal -- pretty much 9 or 10 bucks for the items.  I had the beef brisket sandwich with shoestring fries.  LOVED.   I heard some guy raving about the mac and cheese at the table next to us.  Everyone was happy at our table (chicken and pulled pork sandwiches for my pals).  When we walked in initially I saw this donut making machine and man was I happy when they brought us the bill and a bag of sugared donuts!  Nice way to cap off a great lunch with something sweet.   I am a bit surprised at some of the negative reviews, but I guess you can't please everyone."}
{"text":"What A great night out with my husband! The atmosphere was amazing. I love the old brick wall on the porch. When we walked up to the front door two hostesses opened the doors and greeted us with big smiles! The staff is intelligent, kind and good at what they do. Garrett, out server was amazing! I was told the baby back ribs are the best item on the menu so I chose them. It is true! They are amazing. I ate the roasted corn first and it was so delicious I forgot to leave room for the amazing meat. My teenage boys at home will be happy! I had a strawberry lemonade and it was perfect amount of sweet and tart. In short it was a perfect meal and a perfect night out."}
{"text":"Apparently the man behind Bobby McGees's ( a staple in AZ during the 80's and 90's) decided to sharpen his smoker skills and open a BBQ joint. This is a great sit-down BBQ  restaurant serving high quality food at decent prices. I can say it rivals Joe's BBQ in Gilbert- another crowd favorite.   You are served freshly baked cornbread upon being seated. Choose a beverage and then peruse the menu. There are many choices- pick a meat then whether you want it on a plate or between a bun. I went with the lean brisket on a bun and OMG it was tasty. Moist, fall apart, smoky good. The pit master smokes all meats with almond and mesquite woods, which gives the BBQ a very earthy, smoky flavor. It's fantastic. There are several sides to choose from. I went with the shoestring fries and they were fantastic.   After you are finished with your meal you are served 3 mini donuts covered in sugar. You'll see the mini-donut maker doing it's thing when you walk into the lobby- cool! Staff was friendly, gave us plenty of time to enjoy the meal and conversation, never felt rushed to get out.  There are lunch specials M-F worth checking out, plus there's a patio that is heated and wonderful on those more chilly days or nights. Overall, it's a great place and I can't wait to get back and try something different!"}
{"text":"This place needs to come to California! The cornbread is epic. I ordered their brisket with sides of veggies and mac & cheese. SO MUCH YES. And just when you think it cannot get any better, at the end they give you: complimentary doughnuts?!  Tip: We came here on a Saturday night w/o reservations and had to wait. So, make reservations if possible! Will be visiting again when back in AZ."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to Bobby Q on Saturday afternoonish. We were seated by the patio doors that were opened to the outside. After we placed our drink order we asked to switch tables as it was cold outside. Luckily, we were able to keep our server, Andrew. He was excellent!! I asked him if the rub they used was spicy. He didn't think so but he brought me a sample of the ribs... I was sold!!!   From the first bite of the cornbread to the last bite of donut everything was first rate. The baby back and beef ribs were mouth watering. The beef brisket had excellent flavor. The loaded baked potato was LOADED, the barbecue corn... let's just say I wanted more!!  We had enough for left overs and they were a good a second time around.  The only complaint that I have is if you are seating people on a bench seat make sure it is anchored otherwise it slips around."}
{"text":"Great food great ambience and great service.  A little bit on the slow side when it comes to drinks that can be a bad thing especially if I'm thirsty thirsty :). Are used to go to the one in Glendale of the I 17 which had a dance floor believe it or not and that was a lot more happening per se however this is kind of a more adult lounge kind of great for couples just looking to have a couple drinks or for families that really want to tear some barbecue up love it I give this five stars as well!"}
{"text":"Uuuugh that heavenly goodness they call cornbread is to die for! I've never met an unhappy soul at Bobby Q's. The Brisket is AMAZING. I've had the veggies and fries as a side; both good. I have heard good things from everyone I have eaten with. The little donuts are a great touch.   The service is great. Very attentive, quickly seated. The other thing I haven't like is the cocktails... I've only ordered them once, so maybe it was an off day."}
{"text":"The raving Yelp reviews brought me to this restaurant and the reviews were right on!  The ribs and brisket were very good and the rotisserie chicken was amazing. Better yet was the service. I sat by the bar and Tony took care of me. He started off by enlightening me with the choice of beers and brought me three samples to choose from - all were great! Tony then took the time to explain the meat and side choices and made suggestions. On top of that, at least 4 staff members and a manager came by and asked if I needed anything. I hadn't had this type of service in a long time (and I eat out at least 3-4 times a week). I truly recommend this place. Make sure you come hungry because the portions of food are huge. I'll definitely be back when in the Mesa AZ area!"}
{"text":"This isn't even bbq it's just grilled or slow cooked bs covered in sauce it's honestly depressing"}
{"text":"Very good bbq, atmosphere and service. My mother and I split the Q Rolls and a 2 meat platter with St Louis ribs, chicken, Mac n cheese and fries. Only turn off was we only received one bag of 4 donuts for her and I to split, when we said we live separately we were given a empty bag. Just seemed for the price of the meal they could spare us a couple donuts....just saying."}
{"text":"Great baby back ribs and brisket. The ribs are do meaty and tender. The sauce is on the sweet side it tasty.  The wait staff is attentive. Loved that we found them on Yelp. Will come back."}
{"text":"So, our first visit and I'm pretty satisfied with the experience... waiter/bartender seemed a little nervous or new...not sure which... kitchen messed up, but Tyler the manager got it fixed right away... unfortunately, I believe our server was oblivious to the situation...at one point 8 was speaking to him when another patron interrupted us, the server left me mid sentence... fortunately again, we seemed to be taken care of my Tyler... would love to see the staff more attentive to their surroundings... feel like management is still carrying the staff... we will return..."}
{"text":"Great food and environment, I was helped by Morgan Drake and she is an amazing waitress!!!"}
{"text":"Brisket and bbq pulled chicken was amazing, obviously the Mac and cheese is a total must and it wasn't short of perfect! Atmosphere and service was perfect, awesome draft beer options. Paid about $100 for 2 but GOOD BBQ MEATS AREN'T CHEAP. Will return"}
{"text":"The ribeye steak's seasoning went too far...It was crazy salty. I only finished it, because I respect the meat '.' couldn't throw it away...Everything else was just ok...At the end, they give you house made corn bread when you are already full...   :)"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place! Interesting decor for a BBQ restaurant but overall it was a really great experience. The cornbread is really amazing!"}
{"text":"This would have to be one of the best BBQ restaurants I've been to. We went over lunch & it wasn't busy. I had the pulled pork plated w/Smokehouse Beans & cornbread. I only tried the house BBQ sauce, but they have a spicy as well as a vinegar base. Our waitress was informative & attentive. The iced tea was just right. My pork was moist & just the right amount of smoke. I have never had pulled pork so consistently moist & tender throughout the whole portion like this was. Just the right amount of sauce as well. Beans were sweet w/a little meat in it. Perfection on a plate. The cornbread is sweet & moist as well w/bits of corn in it. My friend is gluten free, so she ordered from the GF menu. She ordered the pulled chicken & was able to eat it all. Hers came w/a side too. It is rustic inside w/hints of an industrial design. They have big round booths or tables. When the bill came they also sent us home w/mini cinnamon sugar donuts. The waitress shared w/is they have two other locations in PH. Next time I'm in the area I will be stopping here. I see why they are ranked top 100 in the nation. If you haven't tried Bobby Q's you are missing some serious BBQ. I thought it was reasonable for BBQ."}
{"text":"Great place to head to for lunch. I ordered the prime brisket sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. A little on the expensive side but quality food and great atmosphere. Recommend for business lunch. The complimentary corn bread was warm and delicious."}
{"text":"We visited Bobby Q for our first meal after moving to Mesa, and we couldn't have picked a better place!  The service was excellent, and the food was delicious.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with shoestring fries.  It's a little more expensive than I'm used to, coming from Tucson, but seems to be standard pricing for Phoenix area restaurants.  We might not become \"regulars\" like the hostess hoped, but this is definitely somewhere I'll take my family when they come up to visit."}
{"text":"My mom and I went in for dinner last night and the food and service were exceptional. We sat in the bar and started with a craft beer flight - love all of the choices they had! Then we had a two meat platter, so we could try a little bit of everything, and it was all delicious. The meats were tender and the sauces were unique and flavorful. All of our sides were just right, and we ended up having he little donuts for dessert. The whole restaurant was kept very nice and we loved the ambiance. Great place - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly it is barely 3 stars. First off, the prices are so high. $27 for a rack of ribs. Any small specialty BBQ is 2/3's the price and better. I went in with high expectations and was disappointed from the start. They put us in a dark area and didn't want us sitting at a well lit table unless we went back up front and waited. The service was slower than expected. I believe more from the kitchen than our server.  The high lite of my meal was the Lemonade. Serious! We both had a pulled pork sandwich. Basically bland poorly seasoned meat on a stale bun. It's only redeeming factor was the bottom of the bun was so hard the juice won't let it get soggy. Though it was very hard to cut. The pecan slaw we put on top help the flavor aspect.  They have 2 sauces. Boring and Barely Good. Barely good did have a little kick The shoe string fries are nice though much to salty. If you don't order desert they give you some fresh donuts that are tasty but need to be cooked longer. Otherwise they are a lovely treat to leave with. I'm sure after a little work they will get things improved. I will go back, since I want to try their beef ribs."}
{"text":"Hubby isn't always in the mood for BBQ, so when he was up for it in Phoenix, I jumped at the chance. And thank goodness we ended up here, because we found some fantastic food!  We arrived around 5p on a Sunday and had about a 20-25 minute wait. Once we got a table we were plenty hungry and ordered right away. In the mean time, we enjoyed some of the complimentary cornbread. It was sweet and soft and hard to resist! Our food was out in no time. We shared a three meat plate and they even split it for us!  The best part of the meal was definitely the STL ribs. They were ridiculously tender! So tender, that when I went to pick it up by the bone, the meat immediately fell off. This is only the second time I have ever found wet style ribs this amazing. It seriously puts every other place to shame. (I will mention that we were told these ribs are fattier than their baby back. So if you prefer something lean, keep that in mind.)  Unfortunately, the beef rib was not quite as impressive. It might have been over-salted and definitely on the chewy side.   However, their brisket was a solid choice! Nice flavor and pretty tender. Also, the shoestring Fries were great! We'd probably do something other than the side of veggies in the future because they were bland in comparison.   After paying the bill and tipping our great waitress, she then delivered a bag of freshly made mini donuts! I saw them being made at the entrance and they looked great, but I was telling myself that I didn't need to have dessert. But being complimentary I couldn't help myself! It was worth it! They were similar to a funnel cake consistency and rolled in cinnamon sugar. They were the perfect ending to a delicious meal!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bobby-Q and i was extremely happy with my experience. From the moment you walk in the door you are greated with a smile by all of the hostesses. Our waitress was awesome and very personable, i wish i would have caught her name, i was there 10/21/16 at around 3pm if that helps. The manager, Taylor, was very kind and was going around to all of the customers making sure they were happy. He is one of the best managers I have encountered! I highly recommend this location to anyone. Fantastic customer care and some of the best food around."}
{"text":"Service was very good. Food quality was top notch except for the brisket which had too much fat that could have been trimmed off. Next time I'll order the baby back ribs and steak and avoid the brisket. We had a very good dining experience at Bobby Q but be prepared for the noise - it is loud there!"}
{"text":"The price was just right. The steak was comparable to Houston's in Scottsdale but the price was better! The shrimp was fantastic and the service was excellent. Can't wait till we meet again Mr. Rib-eye . The service was on point they didn't miss a refill and even gave us a wet wipe. What more could you want from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Love everything on their menu, always great customer service! Love sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"First time being here. I had the Smokehouse Burger was the best burger I've had in a looooong time! Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"First review of the new year! We celebrated a 'Q Year's Eve at Bobby Q and left quite full and satisfied! Making reservations was easy through OpenTable, and when we found out we needed to add a few more people to our table I called the restaurant and asked if they could accommodate us. The hostess was so nice and gracious, going out of her way to find a way to squeeze the extra people into the reservation system.  The restaurant itself is right off the 60 and Stapley. You can't miss it when you get off the freeway. This whole street can be called \"Restaurant Row\" due to the number of eateries here! We were offered the choice of sitting inside but waiting a few minutes or sitting on the covered heated patio outside on a high-top. We went with the outdoor seating and it was quite pleasant. The high top chairs were comfortable, and the table was made from a huge piece of natural wood slab, a cool unique touch. The patio seating was also quite nice since the heaters were very powerful and kept us comfortably warm for the whole night.   The menu offers BBQ obviously, with other options such as salad, steak, chicken, and seafood. 3 of us split the Whole Hog Heaven, a mighty platter with your choice of 2 types of ribs, 2 types of meat, and 3 sides. We decided on the beef ribs, baby back ribs, beef brisket, and pulled pork. We also had the mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and pecan coleslaw as sides.   The platter was indeed a magnificent sight to behold. Of all the meats I enjoyed the pulled pork the most. It was tender, moist, with a good balance of smoke flavor and seasoning. The beef brisket looked to have an admirable smoke ring and was also tender and well seasoned. Of the two ribs I liked the baby back ribs the most. My favorite of the sides was the mac and cheese. It was the perfect balance of creaminess, cheesiness, with a velvety smooth texture and nicely cooked macaroni pasta. The mashed potatoes had a bit of a sour tang to it that I wasn't a big fan of, but they were creamy and smooth, and while I typically enjoy the pecan coleslaw, our side had a gigantic chunk of cabbage leaf in it that wasn't shredded, not good eats!  Service was warm and friendly. Drinks were refilled as needed.  The Whole Hog Heaven can probably satiate 4 regular size appetites. We would have had leftovers enough for one more portion if it weren't for my husband's black hole for a stomach. :)  Before you decide on dessert, make sure you'll have room for both paid dessert and the lovely free cinnamon sugar donuts they give you at the end. They were warm, soft, and delicious!  Overall, I prefer this Bobby Q over the one in Phoenix due to the location which is closer to where I live. I'll definitely be back for more 'Q!"}
{"text":"Love the environment more than anything about this place. It looks cool inside. Things you need to know: Cornbread and donuts. DO NOT leave here without trying both. To die for. Their BBQ food is pretty good. I still think Joes has better BBQ and incredible sauce but if I want to go out and enjoy the whole experience I will come here. Their sides are pretty big too. I am not the biggest fan of their BBQ sauce which is very important to me. I love how they give you a Denny's syrup type pitcher for basically unlimited sauce. You have to ask for more sauce to get it though. Pro tip: Make a reservation on OpenTable because they are ALWAYS busy. Best part is the free donuts after your meal. They may be the best donuts I have ever had in my life, honestly."}
{"text":"First time here and I like the place would be back. I'm from California and if any of my friends and family come visit Arizona I'm going to let them know about this place. I order the top sirloin and it was good. Nice environment and great service."}
{"text":"This place is great!! The loaded baked potato is amazing! Our server Garret really knew his stuff and you can tell he enjoys his job. Answered all of our questions for being first timers with easy and professionalism. Always had a smile on his face and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit! We will be back!  Ps, Deducted one star for the over priced drinks, but that won't keep us from coming back!"}
{"text":"Such a great place,  it explains why they are always busy. Smoked brisket egg rolls were really delicious, and the chipotle sauce is a great added touch. The prime rib was a great selection, the portion sizes are fairly large, but my favorite was the side of mac & cheese. It seriously made me only want to order that from now on! All around a great place to dine and we will be back."}
{"text":"It's ok- but do yourself a favor and go to Joe's BBQ instead if you are looking for drool worthy."}
{"text":"their customer service is phenomenal! we ordered a lot of food but the side of fries were lacking and didn't have very many in it. we told our server and he immediately brought over a WHOLE other side of fries for us. He was super nice. and then the manager came over and apologized and was super sweet to us and then gave us a free dessert. 10/10 their customer service is great. and so is their food ;)"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Saturday night - yes there is a wait, stupid if you won't think there isn't. Food is AMAZING- service is EXCELLENT!!!!! I will keep coming back again and again.  My only complaint - Laura I was all ready stuffed when you gave us desert - which by the way, of course I still ate!  Love all of you guys, keep up the amazing job!"}
{"text":"The fish fry was excellent! So was the cornbread and the Deschutes IPA!! Great atmosphere as well. Stumbled upon it by accident, but am very glad I did!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Service is amazing.  Great job Heather K.  Plenty of table touches from Mgr Terry and Heather so never was in need of anything and was well taken care of. Will be back soon and recommend you to all."}
{"text":"My husband and I sat at the bar, met a group from Hawaii who were so fun. And Dimitri (sp?) was our bartender. He was the most engaging and pleasant bartender we have ever had. (All the staff was great) Food was amazing. We were comfortable, didn't want to leave. We are so glad we came in to check it out. (Just moved here from Boston.) And we will be back again and again. Thank you all so much! Keep up the good work. 3/6/17."}
{"text":"We had a good experience at the Mesa Bobby Q although I'd say that I expected better from the food based on the popularity and price of the place. We made a reservation and as a result our party of five was promptly seated when we arrived. We had a nice spacious table which I very much appreciated. The service was good - prompt, efficient, accurate, and friendly...all the things one would expect or hope for from someone working in a service role. The only thing that was a bit disappointing was the food.  My son had prime rib and it was cold. My husband's ribeye and his steamed veggies were also cool and the baked potato had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for some time. The flavor was good so if they can just get the timing right so all dishes come out piping hot, they'd be right on target!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best new restaurant in the East Valley. This is a classy joint with an amazing atmosphere, tasty drinks and the best BBQ this side of the Rio Grande. Staff is top notch and  management is on their \"A game\". Definitely will become regulars here. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST place to eat in Mesa! I actually can't have bbq because of allergies, but their chicken salad, potatoes and drinks are the best. My husband and kids do get the bbq and they are addicted as well. We try to come in once a week or so as a treat. The prices are definitely reasonable for the food you're getting and I've never had a bad meal here. The waiters have been very gracious and accommodating also."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place and one of my favorite restaurants to go to in general! Everything is so good! I love the cornbread and I always get a pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and we split Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese is some of the best I've had! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is WONDERFUL! Definitely come hungry! The Sunday special family feast is enough to feed 4 grown folks! The brisket YUM! Not sure how I didn't know about this and I do NOW!"}
{"text":"Tried this place and was surprised on how nice the place looks. So to start I was happy to enjoy the ambience, a long with quick drink service they had me excited for the food. They serve these little corn cakes that were great. The brisket and pork were both up to par with other great BBQ in the area. The only reason I give it a 4 is because of the price, I think it's a little too high."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had!! And I spent the first 26 years of my life in Texas! We will be back for sure!! Split the whole hog heaven with someone and try a little bit of everything. Mac and cheese is a must. Q Rolls are to die for."}
{"text":"Omg!!! This place it's amazing!! Friendly staff ,fast service .and the meat it's to die for! Be back next week for sure! And you have free donuts"}
{"text":"The cornbread is excellent, light and fluffy, great corn flavor.  One of people I had lunch with said it was the best burger he has had and the sweet potato fries were good too. Was a disappointed because Yelp said they delivered but when I called to order, the restaurant said they only deliver for large corporate orders."}
{"text":"This is a west side Phoenix staple that I remember growing up with, that has finally branched out to the east side of Phoenix. I am grateful they are less then 10 minutes from my home so I can finally get my fix again. They have incredible food and spectacular ambience to complete the experience.  I got take out this time. The moment you walk in, you are hit with the aroma of smoked meats. The staff was welcoming and eager to assist. After ordering my food the waitress asked if I wanted something to drink - free of charge. My food was served 10 minutes later, and I was given free ranch dressing for my fries.   My pulled BBQ chicken sandwich came with any side I wanted and their cornbread. The total was under $13 with tax. Well worth it. Can't wait to go back and enjoy the patio seating."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant is the beginning-but the food is amazing good!  They begin with cornbread that is so moist it almost falls apart.  Tried the BBQ mac & cheese and salad and need more than a 10 rating for this meal!  The servers are the best I've experienced in a long time.  Happy hour pitchers of beer are $5!  A great happy hour menu from 2-6 Monday- Friday.  What a great experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Comfortable ambience. Perfect food. Our waiter Zach was knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant  (phoenix location, etc), the food and drinks. I can't wait to come back for another amazing experience."}
{"text":"Tried Bobby Q's on Valentines day around 4 in the afternoon.  Not too busy when we arrived but people were waiting when we left.  We have eaten in almost every top rated famous BBQ joint in Texas, and some in the Carolina's and Tennessee.  Bobby Q's is not even close with their meats.  We tried the brisket, pulled pork, and the pork ribs. The brisket was a bit on the dry side, the pulled pork was not very flavorful (without the sauce), and the ribs seemed to be over done.  They seemed surprised that we didn't want sauce on the meat, but on the side.  The sauce was overly sweet.    However, the sides were very good, and the little donuts at the end were excellent.  The service was also excellent. The portions were good, but the prices were somewhat on the high side. We will probably give it another try for their steaks, which we heard were very good. If it weren't for the service and the sides, I would only give it 2 stars.  Little Miss in Phoenix serves \"Real BBQ\" for less $ and is rated one of the top 50 BBQ joints in America. The only BBQ joint in Arizona to receive that honor, and it is excellent."}
{"text":"Joe  our waiter is an awesome person!  Very informative and personable!  He definitely deserves a raise ."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Portions are huge and easily shared unless you want to take some great leftovers home. I will definitely be going back and taking friends and family"}
{"text":"Great tasting food and fabulous service. Waiter was very attentive and manager came at the end and introduced himself. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"You HAVE to try this place! All the food was so delicious and came out speedy fast. Gabriel was a great waiter and was informative about different options of the menu.  All of the meat is smoked and you have your choice of more or less fat. Yes, they will actually give you a piece of meat that you want! With how speedy the food came out, I was worried about the taste and quality but it was so amazing!  I could go on and on about what a great experience it was but you will just need to try it for your self.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This place put a nice spin on the traditional BBQ restaurant. The ambiance was fantastic. The food was impeccable. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I honestly cannot say enough good or positive things about my experience here.  We had come in a few weeks back and can't stop thinking of this place.  1st, our waitress was hands down, the best waitress I've ever had.  I know that's saying a lot but I never once had to ask for a refill on my drink, nor did anyone else in my party of 4.  Our waitress (Jenny O I think was her name) was on point with everything.  She had the wedge salad we ordered out right away (which she had suggested we split as it was huge-good call), then she had the food out just as we finished up with our salad and had everything separated (the sides) just as we had requested.  My daughter spilled her drink and I think Jenny caught it in mid air before it completely spilled over.  I swear that lady was superwoman.  Anyhow, my ribs & steak were on point to where the meat was falling off the bones.  My wife's pulled pork was perfect and my kids loved their Mac & Cheese.  Bobby Q's, if you're reading this, you better give that lady a raise and make sure she never goes anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Wow! Second visit and this place keeps getting better by the visit. We've had the BEST service ever during each visit. And the food, it is awesome-- love the qrolls (?), cornbread, brisket, pork, mac n cheese, grilled veges, and ribs are full or meat, juicy, and tender. I struggled to find good bbq in the east valley and I finally found it. Also, they have amazing drinks. Their cocktails are made with fresh squeezed and sliced fruit.   Go NOW!"}
{"text":"Exceptional BBQ! I always wanted to make it to their original location but never did so I was thrilled when one opened just north of me in Mesa. First off, the rustic atmosphere is perfect. When you walk in, the first thing you see is where they make their complimentary post-meal donuts(save room as this is something to look forward to!). There's a stunning bar and multiple dining rooms including a patio and lounge area. You almost get the feeling that moonshine is being distilled on-site with the charming yet rustic vibe...I really enjoy the unique setting here. One of the best things about a great BBQ joint is of course the smell, Bobby-Q's does not disappoint. There is literally every type of BBQ option you could possibly want as the menu is limitless without any sacrifice to the quality of each item. Portions are massive and I always opt for the 2 or 3 meat combo. Brisket and Ribs are the barometer of great BBQ and are absolute highlights here. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I can tell this place is going to stick around and do well!  Unbelievable service, our bartender Savannah was amazing! I had the Sliced BBQ Prime Beef Brisket, it was to die for.  So much flavor and so tender!  No wonder this place is in the top one hundred restaurants to try on Yelp!  If you haven't been to Bobby Q's right now, get there asap!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for Father's day dinner, wait was long but staff was very friendly and the food was good. Would come back again. The free mini hot donuts were delish"}
{"text":"5 stars, are you people serious? Just a lot of smoke blown up your behind. If you like lots of decor with a very attentive waiter, this place is for you. If you like good BBQ then look elsewhere! The brisket they serve must be traumatized in a presurecooker, frozen for prosperity and finely nuked in a microwave then plated piping hot just after misting the thing with liquid smoke. Yuck!!!!  2 stars for decor 0 for the so called BBQ! RUN.....    follow up to mark, you call yourself a chef and condone the habitual use of a microwave and liquid smoke. Oh, a free meal. Just the thought makes me want to puke.  I think I may be suffering from PTSD....."}
{"text":"Good food, nice diggs, too much $$"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here one night for a quick dinner before a show at Gammage. We were quickly seated in the bar area and there was a big party going on in half of it and the patio. Was a little concerned we might not have enough time but our server came right over and was very attentive and great despite having the party. Food was fantastic. I had pulled pork and it was flavorful and I really liked the BBQ sauce. Side dishes were all great as well. They have some unique fun drink options and I want to go back to try them all! My daughter had one of the stuffed baked potatoes with pulled pork and loved it. It looked great. Manager came by to all the tables and asked how everything was as well which is always a nice touch. Fun different atmosphere, the patio areas look nice for when the weather warms slightly!"}
{"text":"I've only been one time so far, but absolutely steller. On recommendation of a friend, 2 of us only got the 3 meat platter. It was enough food for both of us to get full but not stuffed.  Drinks were great,  we had the pineapple specialty drink and another drink, the pineapple drink was nothing but alcohol but tasted great. One and only gripe was the pineapple drink had a little too much ice in it, the type of ice made it a little hard to drink (tiny chunks). I just used a spoon, so the gripe is basically nothing.  Great place, will be going back."}
{"text":"We had a family dinner tonight at the Mesa location. The interior of the restaurant is adorable. We tried the ribs, pulled pork and brisket all of which were amazing. I loved the grilled veggies and the side salad was crisp and fresh. Great for big groups."}
{"text":"Really good food, nice atmosphere, HUGE draft beer selection for a restaurant that doesn't stay open for \"bar hours\", OUT OF THIS WORLD MAC AND CHEESE, oh and they bring you freshly made cinnamon and sugar doughnuts with the check. That check is usually a little pricey but worth it.  That mac and cheese though... #drool"}
{"text":"Overall delicious food and great service! I've had the brisket both times I've been here... amazing!!! Can't wait to go back to try the ribs!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Also, An easy mistake was made and they immediately remedied the situation."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time the other day..... After being told it was owned by the same people as Bobby McGee's I expected more out of the menu..... The service was exquisite & so was the food... as far as I was concerned it was a little limited if being compared to Bobby McGee's.... There is no 'salad bar' (the bath tub) That is the only reason not to have 5 stars...... They have a side of corn that would make you feel like you were in the south & was eating fried corn It was so good I could've had it & nothing else."}
{"text":"This place has the best pulled pork brisket I have ever had! I love it! I have never sat down in the restaurant to eat! I normally do take out but the atmosphere there looks nice! They also have awesome sides. I loved the mashed potatoes, corn and and ranch style beans!"}
{"text":"Unlimited cornbread.  My boyfriend and I have been here twice. Our first impression was \"damn, this is one classy bbq establishment!\".  I usually like getting the baby back ribs. It's so tender and flavored well. The meat falls off the ribs. Ugh, it's so good. You just have to try it. I usually a get a side of mac and cheese and it's very creamy and filling.   The servers are very nice and accommodating. They refilled our waters often.   Note: Mini fried doughnuts at the end. What a great way to end the night."}
{"text":"Yum and eeeee. This was some good azz BBQ folks!! Fall of the bone, don't even think about touching my Q.   Callie was our Q server extraordinaire. Hey girl, hey. I see you. She was a doll face 10+ on the service she provided. Yazzz.  On to the food! I had the baby back ribs, grilled vegetables and the ranch beans. Ribs were tender and robust (ha my kid said to use that word). My kiddo had the pulled brisket sandwich and said the roll was really good and the meat was good but a bit salty.  She also had the mac n cheese and gave it a good thumbs up.  Cornbread was realllyyyyy good, not better then mine tho but close! Needless to say no room for dessert! Good good food and great service. Will we return? That would be a yes...   Shout out to my baby dolls at the front! They were sweetie pies. Heyyyyy ladies.  I even did a love up aka pay it forward...for the table next to us! In secret tho. Love up y'all...love up"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I've ever had when it comes to BBQ, they set the expectations high for everyone else. they really smoke their meats. They have good sides to choose from, a bit pricey but that's good BBQ. Bring your appetite"}
{"text":"We finally tried this place on Father's day. After a 80 minute wait. My husband ordered Brisket sandwich and I ordered the loaded baked potato with brisket. The meat was extremely fatty I couldn't really eat it. My husband ate his dinner but honstley save your money go to  Rudy's in chandler the quality of the food is way better."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing lay out with bar, lounge area and a great patio.   The food and D rink are on point.   What made our experience 5 stars is w the awesome waiter GABE!   He was attentive, knowledgeable on the history of. Bobby q ,the menu, and great customer service.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow.....pretty much sums it up. Great service and amazing food! We met the owner who was walking around asking how our experience was and the GM was also doing the same thing. My husband and I shared a plate that had a bit of everything and yeah, just amazing! Would recommend this place to all my friends and family and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This has become a favorite place to come too. Previously Bobby Gee's, now Bobby Q's.  I had the Smokehouse Burger which is the fresh ground beef, cheddar cheese, bacon, crispy onions, BBQ sauce, and secret sauce. I ordered the shoestring fries as my side. Food was delicious and mouth watering. The ground beef was juicy and very tasty. The portions are very filling. The serve you moist, fresh cornbread and butter while you wait for your meal. Food is truly outstanding. The service was wonderful! I do suggest you make a reservation for this place via Yelp. No waiting if you do make one. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, food and how the is prepared. Attentive service through out your meal. The cost is not too bad on price considering what you get in my opinion. The smokehouse burger was $15.00. The desserts run at $8.00. Again, you do get what you pay for here. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great service and the BBQ is fantastic, especially for a chain.  It's a bit pricey but BBQ is generally expensive.  I've been 3times and the food has been great every time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to several steakhouses in the area. Tonight was our fifth experience at Bobby Q's. I ordered my steak black and blue which is seared on the outside and rare on the center and when it came to my table it was grilled. When the manager Tracy came by to check on our dining experience we were able to tell her that my steak was not the way I wanted it. Tracy immediately offered to make me a brand-new steak. Less than 10 minutes later I had a perfect black and blue ribeye delivered to my table with two side dishes that i had ordered. Tracy removed the steak i didn't want and apologised for the inconvenience. Not only was our service awesome the bartenders at Bobby Q's are some of the best in the valley. The service we get at the bar is always above and beyond what we expect. My husband and I already enjoyed dining at Bobby Q's but from now on we won't go to any other steak house because of how well we are treated."}
{"text":"This is some of the best barbecue in the Valley!  I started with the Cajun shrimp and found myself nibbling them down to my fingertips.  For an entree I chose the rib combo that included the best beef ribs I've ever had in my life.  Large portions and delicious brews on tap. Bobby Q's will be a regular destination for us."}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious bbq and fresh made cornbread. Enjoyed the special with brisket ribs and pulled pork with sides with Gary's mom and Rob"}
{"text":"I have been a meat and BBQ lover my whole life so whenever a place with a good reputation makes it's way to my area I obviously have to give it a try.   I made reservations for 2 on a Thursday night around 7 which I figured would mean it'd be pretty busy so I was prepared for that but it wasn't all that busy. We were the only people waiting for a table so I saw that as a good sign, but than a few couples and a family showed up after us and got sat immediately while we waited, which I found very odd. But it wasn't a massive deal.   The service was decent. I wouldn't really say it was amazing. We were waiting a pretty decent time for drinks and we didn't get checked on very often so they left a little to desire there.   I got the 3 meat choice with ribs, brisket, and pork.The pork was by far the best. The brisket was good and moist, but I definitely didn't love it which sucks because I usually absolutely love brisket. The ribs were decent as well just not great.   The sides is where I think they lost the most point with me, I got fries and corn. The fries were all hard and stale feeling. Either they got over cooked or left under a heat lamp for too long. The corn was decent but just so unappetizing.  The BBQ sauce was probably the highlight of the meal which is kind of sad for me.   If you are going to charge the kinds of prices this establishment charges, the quality has got to be way better in my humble opinion. There are better options for BBQ way cheaper in the valley. I'm sure once they get past the \"new location\" phase things will get better.   Unfortunately my first visit was a bust."}
{"text":"We completed our 5:00 reservation on 10/5. First off, the design of the restaurant is beautiful. Several types of seating, indoor and out, to fit each request. They nail every detail here, with a gorgeous and inviting bar, perfect lighting, and plenty of space to move around. The cocktails are properly dosed, and the bar has a respectable selection of spirits. Our dinner and service had several hiccups, especially with receiving the wrong food, and we hardly received any privacy from answering staff members who were genuinely requesting feedback. But here's the thing: even with mistakes, the service and food still beat out any other establishment that I've visited in the valley - and that's the truth. I'm confident that no other restaurant in the valley offers this level of customer service. I don't spend $150 on dinner for two very often, and when I do, I'd like to not have so many errors; but I know those errors are a symptom of adjustment, which is why we didn't make a fuss. I can't wait to come back when things are even more tuned. This is our favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was by far the best barbecue restaurant I've been to in a long time I enjoyed the environment and the food was great together I would go back soon until all my friends about it also definitely."}
{"text":"Great food and affordable prices.  This place has some awesome barbecue and great lunch specials."}
{"text":"The seasoning and mac & cheese and cornbread was amazing! For the price the sandwich was disappointing because I ordered two of them and there was all kinds of fat in the brisket and very little beef, and I grew up on a cattle ranch making brisket sandwiches and there should be at least 3/4 ratio on beef/fat or the way I make them ...it is all beef and no fat at all at home."}
{"text":"I don't where to start. From sitting down at the table to leaving this restaurant, it was wonderful all the way through. Wonderful food and wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Great ribs!  Very good service, fresh food.  Fun decor."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and I gotta say, this was the most tender brisket I've ever had in my life! I had a lunch meeting for work and we had a chance to have good conversation with a quiet ambiance. Also, nice touch with the free house made donuts at the end to take with us. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Starters the server was great! I believe his name is Joe. They bring cornbread to the table which is absolutely the best cornbread I have ever tasted! They serve it with REAL butter! The food came quickly and the manager came and spoke to us and brought us more cornbread!!!! The food was perfect! Three meats and two sides!!! Perfect perfect perfect and the scenery is amazing! Oh yeah and the doughnuts"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly delish!!  Our party of 7 was completely satisfied. Large portions of Beef ribs, smoked chicken, brisket, country-fried chicken, man n cheese and cornbread all of it done right!!! Very friendly service, sat down fast and food came out to table quick.  It's hard to find a place who does beef ribs and now Bobby Q is definitely on my top list with Phils bbq!!! Great location too!!"}
{"text":"Best damn barbecue in the Valley. Mesa has a new spot to try; rids to near perfection. Aged steaks and sausage that would put on its on show. It's a little pricey but you will enjoy the ]"}
{"text":"Long warm day, stopped in to try some BobbyQ.  Not that i am an expert, but damn fine.  The brisket was prefect,  the babybacks were really good, smokey an just a touch a sweet.    But what really made the night was our server Jessica.  Not only was she excellent at customer service but was amazingly funny.  Made the night!  Thanks Jessica, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"First time being here. Awesome BBQ, great lunch size portion, friendly staff, fast service. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ restaurant in town. Literally everything was top quality, from the fresh squeezed lemonade, to the moist rotisserie chicken, to the crutons on the side salad.  The price was very reasonable. I look forward to coming back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Delicious Food, Great Atmosphere!  I had the Salmon Patty and two sides, plus Freshly made Bread with Butter!  I shall return!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was fantastic.  Prices are great, the hostess even we're very welcoming. My husband ordered the two meat combo and got sausage and brisket, the brisket was a fatty and when the manager was rounding at our table I mentioned it.  She brought an entire new plate, came back twice after to make sure the we enjoyed our stay.  I haven't had service like this in years and they comped his meal.  My husband had the house Thunderbird ale and said it was great as well.  The Cheri donut at the end was ridiculously amazing!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and food were fantastic.  Service could have been slightly better.  This is going to sound picky, but I really appreciate when used plates and garbage are removed throughout the course of the meal.  The BBQ was the best that I've ever had.  My wife and I shared the Whole Hog and we had plenty left over."}
{"text":"So delish! Everything we had, food and drinks exceeded my expectations! So glad they opened one here in Mesa! Yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner not only because of the food, but the service and ambience. Servers were efficient, friendly and gave great recommendations. Wife loved her grilled salmon and veggies. I loved my baby back ribs. My sides were mashed potatoes with gravy, and mac and cheese. All were melt in your mouth good, including the free corn bread. We got free mini donuts at the end our meal and they were awesome. We also got 10% off by checking in on Yelp. Bar is huge and has every adult beverage imaginable. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Bobby Q has been on my to-do list for quite some time, and now there's a location closer than north Phoenix to the East Valley!  I. love. BBQ. Period. So when this new location comes onto my radar and I have an equal amount of interest from friends, it's on for dinner. If you want to set a reservation, you can do via OpenTable or call them. I mixed up dates on OpenTable so I had to call them, but the girl on the phone was quite pleasant & secured the correct date all while asking what our seating preference was. So we were set.   Arrival time comes and *boom* you're hit with a smokey-smell walking up from the parking lot. ::insert drool-y mouth::  We were sat immediately and it wasn't too busy on this weeknight, so we probably would have fared well without a reservation. Our server was great - he kept our drinks full and gave us some time to look at the menu and for some dining stragglers. When we asked him for suggestions, he told us that you could do no wrong with anything on the menu. Lord was he correct!   Cornbread = I wanted more... there wasn't enough for all of us ravenous diners in our group [how about unlimited bread?!] My meal was the pulled pork & two side dishes combo, of which I picked mac n cheese and veggies [#GottaStayHealthyIsh]. Loved every bite of it with their BBQ sauce, and I actually took a doggy bag home despite all efforts to join the Clean Plate Club. I was surprised with the doggy bag of donuts as he passed out checks. I managed to eat one and fell in love [because carbs = love], so much that one of my friends just gave me his bag too. Cannot wait to come back and try more BBQ!"}
{"text":"Second time here! Cornbread is the best! Service was slow, but our server Anthony made up for that by offering us an appetizer on the house! He (Anthony) provided us with excellent customer service! We (my wife and I) left thoroughly satisfied as did our out of town guests who enjoyed the ribs, links and especially the brisket! Even the appetizer (Cajun shrimp) was delicious! We ordered some to go! Can't stop talking about the food here and have been telling friends and family! Bobby Q's is the best!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time and the food here.  I had never been to the Phx location, so was a new one all-around.   Joe's in gilbert has been for while my go-to BBQ in the east valley, and though it is still very good, have been ready for new place.  And Bobby Q's has filled the spot well.  Though a longer drive for me, still worth it.    My food was excellent, had a good selection of draft beers.  Even an Amber beer which I really liked, and most I don't.  Their cocktails with whiskey were excellent.  I will be ordering those from here on out.   If you have not tired it, I would recommend it.     Also make sure you get your free mini donuts on the way out.  As they are nothing short of amazing."}
{"text":"From going to piggly's last night and coming out disappointed, I'm very happy with this place! I had the brisket and that melted in my mouth. Extremely soft meat, I can't believe it! The veggies were perfection and so was the Mac and cheese. I'm a person who loves food and I'm super picky, this place totally deserved 5 stars. The service was also amazing and the manager was super nice the way he greeted people. Only thing disappointing is that we don't have a Bobby Qs in San Diego California.... leaving happy, full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Cornbread was the definite star today... The grilled corn was also very good.  The protein of the day was without a doubt the chicken - would definitely order again.   The sausage was pretty dry but had good flavor.   The brisket was very overcooked and was basically mush. It was to the point that I may have shed a tear for that cow....  All in all, the meal was passable and the service was excellent during busy lunch time. I'll be back, but brisket certainly won't be on my plate next time..."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Definitely going back to Bobby Q!! Loved everything about it."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Chris at the bar served a tasty craft old fashioned and provided a nice intro to the restaurant. Had  the brisket rolls on his recommendation which were amazing. Lots of meat, great flavor. The bbq sauce was a little sweet for me but I loved it. Had the ribs/ steak combo and it was out of this world! Meaty ribs and tender juicy flavorful steak. Service by Drew was wonderful and prompt. Manager Cameron was on the ball and very watchful. The donuts were a great (but not for the waistline) surprise. I will definitely be back as soon as I worked off this meal."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my gf before a bowling date. This is absolutely the best barbecue in town. Compared to barbecue I used to get in Texas this is probably the most authentic smoked Barbecue I have ever tasted. We had a 15 minute wait for our table on a Friday night, not bad and well worth the wait. There were open seats at the bar, so I decide to get a beer while we waited. They have a huge local and craft beer tap selection!  They definitely know what's up in the beer scene. I love the design of the place, it's super clean and there is a ton of detail and effort put into the decorations. I dig industrial appliances so old cast pipes and belt driven ceiling fans are my thing, I get huge kick out of. The designers did not overlook a single square inch of the place when putting it together. Food was of course amazing and wait service was top notch. Not one thing I could even try to complain about. So yeah perfect Restaraunt, perfect experience and that's not exaggerating."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere in the social bar and our waitress Dusti was great!!! Will be back for sure and will recommend!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for a dinner with my family. We had seen the place before when driving north on I-17 and were interested in trying it now that it made its way closer to our house.    First off, I have to call out the macaroni and cheese. It was one of my side dishes and I had to protect it, lest it get consumed by someone other than me. It is creamy, flavorful and amazing. The beans were my other side. They were fine, but I would get double mac and cheese next time.  My wife had the pulled pork and I had the brisket and sausage plate. We shared, so we each tried several of the barbecued meat options. All of it was good, but I don't think anything was AMAZING. I might be a more harsh critic of barbecue than others since I, too, cook large slabs of meat for hours on end. In my book, the meat gets a solid 4 stars with marks for good smoke flavor. The sausage had a LOT of smokiness, which is something to know if you like yours on the lighter side. My brisket was a little less firm than I usually make it, but the flavor was good and it wasn't buried in a pool of sauce like at some places.   Their signature appetizer, which consisted of brisket wrapped up like eggrolls was tasty, and everyone enjoyed the barbecue sauce.  They have a collection of handcrafted cocktails (honestly, who doesn't these days?), and a good selection of beers, including some local offerings. I was here for the food, so I had water.   I had the two meat platter (2 meats, 2 sides, cornbread)... and think I piled down the whole day's calorie intake at one sitting. They brought corn bread (lots of butter in it and not sweet)... I like all kinds of corn bread, even if it has sugar in it. No doubt, I left a little too full.   After we got the check, they brought a little bag of cinnamon-sugar doughnuts to close things out. Apparently, they're fresh-made by the hostess stand. Dang... it's just wafer-thin! The oil may have been just a touch under temperature, or maybe I was just trying to find an excuse to give away one of them to the kids... but, they were miniature DOUGHNUTS and I had to eat at least one.   Despite the crowd and the inrush of large groups of people while we were there, the service was very good. Although the up-sell was a little harder than at some other places, I'll give them a pass since us saying no to the upgrades did not seem to affect the attention we received."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last few months to have lunch with my Dad. They open at 11 am and both times we arrived about five minutes before then. The first time we were early the hostess let us wait inside up front where we could sit out of the heat. The last visit the hostess wouldn't let us in so we stood outside chatting in the heat.  Their dinning room is really nice and welcoming. They bring out bread and butter with your beverages at the start of each meal. Both visits we ordered the lunch combo under the Lunch Sandwiches section. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich ($9.50) with the side salad. You can order one side, soup or salad. Also if you check in on Yelp you get 10% off your total order.   Both visits were peaceful and our waiter and waitress were both polite, professional, and attentive. They also bring out free donuts to take home for free at the end of the meal in a doggy bag. Overall the food was decent but nothing really stood out to me besides how nice our servers were. However, there are lots of other places in this area to try also."}
{"text":"I have not been here in a year it seems  loved it then I'm not sure how but it's even better. My belly's full and I'm leaving feeling warm and fuzzy awesome thanks"}
{"text":"Tried it several times now and although the BBQ is very good I have found it to be a little on the heavy smoked side. The ribs are fall off the bone delicious and the brisket is wonderful. Hours later you find yourself dealing with the smoke flavor. Definitely not a fan of the sausage, its just too much smoke! And I love sausage. I guess you can have too much of a good thing.  Very good service and it's a great looking restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great barbeque restaurant. Food was very tender and well cooked. I thought items were a little pricey, however the end result was great tasting food and friendly service."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Service was a little slow on a Saturday night, but that is because they were packed!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Portions are quite large, expect to have leftovers.  Prices are reasonable, individual entrees appear to be overpriced.  Since this was our first time visiting we settled on their \"Whole Hog Heaven\" (Pick two ribs- Baby backs, st. Louis, beef ribs. Pick two meats- Pork, brisket, sausage, chicken. Pick three sides- Mac & cheese, shoestring fries, ranch beans, pecan cole slaw, potato salad, roasted corn, mashed potatoes, grilled vegetables, baked potato), which was priced at $49.  That turned out to be a great choice and a feast! It was shared by 3 and still had leftovers.  My favorite was the brisket and baby backs, the chicken was just average (skipping next time we visit).  I think this is now my favorite BBQ spot."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The staff is friendly and attentive and the food was yum yum yummy!! Plus you get a bag of fresh made donuts complementary at the end of the meal! 5 all the way! Oh and the corn bread is delicious"}
{"text":"I've been here one time and was not impressed. The wait staff, once seated, seemed to lack in attentiveness to any of my inquiries/needs. Once I was finally able to order after waiting ten minutes for a waiter to take my order, the food took over 25 minutes. For the hassle that I went through, the food was not worth the wait/frustration. Maybe it was the time and day I went, who knows!"}
{"text":"First time here and we had an interesting experience - enough so that it warrants 4 stars, almost entirely for the customer service!   Our initial view of the place took in the beautiful tropical plants surrounding the outdoor patio - very nice. The front doors were open & we were immediately seated. (Be warned - it is pretty loud inside.) Our server, Justin Rex, was professional and informative, giving us the history of the restaurant, which used to be Bobby McGee's. He took our drink & dinner orders (Bob's Salad for me with exclusions, Southern Fried Chicken for hubby, Stuffed Baked Potato for our friend). While Justin returned frequently to refill our glasses & the cornbread, it took over 30 minutes to get our food. Although he told us twice that our meals should be coming up soon, after the second time my friend said \"You told us that 15 minutes ago...\". He apologized & their meals soon arrived. Mine, though, took a bit longer. While everyone appeared happy with their dishes, my salad was sadly lacking. I had requested no tomatoes or walnuts (allergies), but what I got was lettuce, apple slices, cranberries, goat cheese, 4 very small pieces of chicken, and some nut pieces. We let Justin know, and the manager came with a small dish of chicken to add to my salad. (A nearby table patron ordered my same entree salad & it was HUGE! So at least I know what it's supposed to look like.)  Here's where the restaurant shines - its customer service! Manager Taylor Branch took \"full responsibility\" for the error, which I've never seen done in current food service. He kept an eye on us throughout our meal. As Justin cleared our plates, I pointed out the 3 small pieces of walnut on the rim of my salad bowl; he asked if I was allergic, and I confirmed this. I then went to the restrooms. When I returned, I learned that our meals had been made complimentary because of all the trouble we encountered. Taylor came by our table again, extremely apologetic, and both he & Justin asked us to give their business another try sometime.  We appreciated that the first item placed on the table by Justin was his business card stapled to a comment card, which also listed his name. It was equally appreciated when Taylor also gave me his business card. (This is a really nice, professional touch.) These two gentlemen went above & beyond the call and should be commended for it. They were definitely worth the tip we left. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to the mesa location last night. The food is amazing and def best BBQ in az.  Prime rib is tender and flavored since it is prepared in a wood rotisserie.   The baby back ribs are the best thin they have though. I wish the server was more knowledgeable about what bourbons they have.  I asked her for blantons or Basil Hayden's and she said they didn't have either of that and we opted for Woodford reserve instead.  When we left we saw both bottles and more higher end bourbon in the bar.  Not her fault since she clearly hasn't received proper training.  She was very attentive and friendly.  Great BBQ and will highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have not been to this location, but they catered my jobs Halloween party. It was so delicious and I enjoyed it. I don't eat pork so BBQ can be complicated for me at times. I liked that they had pulled chicken as well as brisket. Definitely need to make my way"}
{"text":"Tried out Bobby Q recently and enjoyed it. The ribs are great and are big portions. Convenient location. Will most likely be back. Typically go down the road south to Joe's BBQ but they're both good!"}
{"text":"We liked Bobby Qs, especially the cornbread, the cornbread wins them a 2nd star. But the next day... we changed our minds. I'm pretty sure my family of 4 all got food poisoning from them. We each spent the day on the toilet. And when you have to change multiple diarrhea diapers for your child in 1 day, you typically don't ever go back to the place that caused it.  Update: yeah, for sure got food poisoning from these guys. No question. And Bobby-Qs, I'd suggest if you can't take accountability for it, perhaps don't say anything at all."}
{"text":"Growing up I remember Bobby MaGees as our families \"fancy dinner out\" place.  We always went for my parents birthdays. So it was fun seeing Bobby Qs open up in Mesa. They've been open for almost a year. I strongly recommend doing reservations. Anytime we tried to walk in before it was a long wait. There was a line of people when we got there and when we left.  Food was decent. Husband ordered three meats. Brisket. Ribs and sausage with Mac n cheese and baked potato. I ordered the ribeye with fries and Mac n cheese.  BBQ sauce was on the sweet side. Ask for a side of the spicy BBQ sauce. It was pretty good. I even put it on my steak. Fries were thin and crispy. Mac n cheese was homemade and creamy. No blue box here.  We started with the Cajun shrimp and it was tasty. Didn't look pretty but it tasted good. They also bring you cornbread to start.  After filling up on dinner, they gave us a brown bag filled with donuts after. Overall food was good. Service was great."}
{"text":"Old Bobby Magee's crew I went to as a kid brings a killer BBQ experience with awesome service and great ambiance!"}
{"text":"We went here for my mothers in law's birthday and started out with the Que rolls and they were so yummy...made me excited to order lunch! I ordered the fried chicken and it was delicious! The batter they used for the chicken was flakey and scrumptious and the gravy was to die for! We ended the meal with the mud pie and it was HUGE! Great food and service, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Clearly they have their systems down pat. Very, very happy with this most recent visit.  All the people here are friendly and attentive.  The corn bread is yummy as are the freshly made donuts served on your way out. Brilliant idea, that one! Nothing like the smell of freshly made donuts to get the body in the mood to eat right when you walk in.  I recommend the beef brisket. One portion was a bit fatty but both of us really enjoyed the flavor. Pulled pork also well prepared. Original BBQ sauce has a great flavor profile. Portions are huge. Fair pricing. Sides are sides. Good but not noteworthy and who really cares - also very generously portioned.  Our server recommended the mud pie and cautioned the serving size was huge. We tried it. It was huge. The peanut butter/chocolate crust was the best part. The ice cream is not up the quality standard of their other products. Gone are the days when really good ice cream was not so easy to come by.   Happy to see this place expanding to other locations. I still like the original location the best - something about it having been a Valley staple for so many decades. Will definitely be trying their Arcadia area location in the future.  P.S. Thank you for the very generous Yelp check-in offer."}
{"text":"Excellent! Made reservations through YELP, showed up and was seated immediately. Waitress was very attentive, our water glasses never ran dry. We shared the queso dip and it was a hit for the whole table. This place really is pretty cool. The decor is amazing but more importantly food and service exceeded expectations. Best meal in AZ so far."}
{"text":"Great service, great bbq. Seated very quickly and ordered an appetizer. Ordered the BBQ rolls which were basically a brisket egg roll which were very good. It came with six of them so definitely a good appetizer for a group.  For the entree I had the baby back ribs and it came with two sides. I got the fries and grilled veggies. The ribs were great, meat was falling off the bone and the waiter brought us a spicy bbq sauce as well as a regular which were both good.   The grilled veggies weren't anything special but definitely a lighter item needed after the ribs and bbq rolls.  I'll definitely be coming back next time in AZ."}
{"text":"Late yesterday afternoon my boyfriend and I decided we had a hankering for BBQ, so.we decided to try Bobby Q. The place looked terrific on the inside and the aroma of the meat wasc intoxicating. Our lovely server was named Ashland. Besides being pretty and delightful, she was very knowledgeable about the menu. We had the Q-rolls (brisket with a pastry wrap) for an appetizer. OMG! I've never experienced anything so delicious! We ended up choosing baby back ribs and the meat just fell off the bone and was so tender and juicy... The corn bread was out of this world! Ashland wanted to give us a sample of what the brisket tasted like so she brought us three or four slices because I was determined to have brisket on my next visit. Let's just say my former mother-in-law used to make the best brisket on the planet. Not anymore! The service was superb and the food was amazing! At the end of the meal we had four mini donuts to take home with us. The female manager came by our table and asked us how our meal was and we raved about it plus the service. As we left the hostesses thanked us for coming. An hour after we got home we decided to try the donuts. All I can tell you is I haven't stopped thinking about that meal since. It wasn't just about having a meal out, it was a dining experience... A lot of other restaurants could learn from them."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service, great ambiance.  Q-Rolls are like lil naked chimis, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food at this place is always amazing. The issue that we have had when we have had an issue is with service. Unfortunately the most recent time that we walked in it seemed like takeout area was more concerned with texting on their phone than serving customers. Another time,  again we order takeout  and part of our order was missing when we got home . Other than that as I said, the food is always amazing. Hopefully the service catches up to the food :-)"}
{"text":"Had a taste for BBQ today. Decided to try this new location with my husband and son. My husband and I ordered the two meat combo with mac and cheese with ranch beans. Omg! There was so much food! We're so use to going to BBQ places that cost a lot but give you only a little bit of food. They do not cheat you on food. My two meat choices were  beef ribs, brisket. The brisket was sooooo good! The ribs had a lot of meat on them. The sides were excellent. Very pleased and stuffed!  Our server Miles did an excellent job.  He messed up a little with the dessert but the general manager corrected it so it was fine.  I will come back."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place!! Everything is so delicious and their Mac and cheese is to die for!! My favorite place to eat and very friendly staff! And me and my family love the donuts you get at the end!"}
{"text":"Argh. Sometimes, Yelp is frustrating. I come from a hospitality background and I love reading reviews before checking out new restaurants. A friend of mine invited me to go to Bobby Q Friends and Family night. I couldn't go. :( Because I couldn't make it, he told me that the official opening would be on Monday, Oct. 3rd. I went online and made a reservation, per his instructions, and was looking forward to some awesome BBQ. We arrived right on time for our reservation. A very pleasant young lady held the door open for us as K, C and I walked in and greeted us with a very nice \"hello, enjoy your evening\". I actually had to stop and process what I just experienced. But wait, then we walked up to the host/hostess stand, gave our name and reservation time, and were told our table would be available momentarily. Wait again, a reservation that is actually being honored within 2 minutes of its time. Unheard of. Another young lady asked us if we wanted a fresh donut to enjoy while we waited for our table. The donut fryer is just inside the door as well and really, who can resist a fresh, still warm, cinnamon/sugar donut? As she bagged up our little puffs of heaven, our table was called. She told us she would escort us to our table and we could enjoy our donuts while we read the menu. She was very nice and visited with us for a moment while we were seated. Man, it was like being in a hospitality training video on service and how to do it right. The donuts? They were scrumdillyishous. Our server was Celina. K immediately commented that Celina must be from corporate because she knew the menu inside and out. She was polished, articulate, pleasant and on her game. If I was filling out a report on her service, she would have gotten an A+. Before we got our food Celina brought us a basket with 3 cornbread pucks. They were very good but a tad dry. No biggie really because the butter melted away and I was transported right to my grandmothers' house in Kansas and her homemade cornbread. The food was actually, amazing. C ordered the Smokehouse Burger ($12.00) with a side of Mac & Cheese ($2.00). He also got fries with the burger. The patty looked to be about 1/2 lb. This burger also had cheddar cheese, smoked bacon, crispy onion strings, bbq sauce & secret sauce. C pretty much had everything but the bacon & cheese on the side. He also ordered it Medium and it was perfect. This burger is gloriously seasoned.The smoked bacon adds that lovely smokey flavor and add the onion strings and cheese and it's Winner Winner Awesome Burger Dinner. The Mac & Cheese side was a decent portion. 2 bones with the burger was fair, $4 as a side is a bit steep for the portion size. I'll talk about pricing later. The Mac & Cheese is a 5 cheese blend. It's VERY cheesy. I mean, really cheesy. C was caught off guard a little because he's not used to Mac & Cheese elevated to this level. Sure, he's had it at a few restaurants around town and even one we frequent in Huntington Beach, Ca. But this, now this is really very good Mac & Cheese. Again, winner winner. K and I both had the Two Meat Combo Platter ($23.00) which includes 2 sides. The menu on the website shows $22.00 but I'm sure that's a misprint, right? Anywhoos, we ended up getting the same meats. I know, we should have tried 4 different meats but K was thinking what would be the best to reheat the next day for dinner at work. Regardless, we both got Brisket and St. Louis Ribs. WOW. This was easily, and I mean far and away THE BEST BRISKET I have ever had. It just melted in your mouth. Juicy, smokey, tender. Amazing. The St. Louis Ribs were also amazingly delicious. Fall off the bone tender with a very nice BBQ glaze painted on.  K got mashed potatoes and Ranch Beans for her sides while I got mashed Potatoes and Roasted Corn. All of the sides were yummy.  So here's the negative. The pricing is high. C ordered a flavored lemonade and it was $3.49. There were only 4 ribs with the combo. I think there should have been 6 or half rack for $23.00. BUT, the food is soooo good. Lastly, on the first page of the Bobby Q website it says \"Voted Best BBQ Restaurant in the US\". Well, not really. They were voted in the top 30 from OpenTable. I think it's a bit pompous to even think you're the best BBQ in the US when you only have 2 restaurants, both in AZ., and this one just opened, today. So the results were calculated by diners scores. This brings me to my first issue. As of this writing, this location already has five 5 star reviews out of a total of 5 reviews. BUT, 2 of the 5 reviews were done before the restaurant was actually open and I feel like the others are typical Yelp reviewers throwing 5 Stars around like candy flying out of a busted pinata. Understand, I think Bobby Q's is awesome. Maybe it should be 5 Stars. My problem with 5 Stars is that means there's no room for improvement and I think the prices could be improved on.  Awesome space. Awesome Service. Awesome Food. High Prices. 4.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! Love their food ( especially prime rib) - great fast service and atmosphere ! The portions are huge ( so come ready to EAT!) and they give you yummy mini donut holes after meals to satisfy your taste buds even more ! Yes please !"}
{"text":"This place is great! On weekends its superrr full so you do have to wait a little while to be seated. You can chill at the bar tho! The food is really good, a bit pricey for my liking. I can get the same piece of stake across the street (texas road house)for half the price. Last time my friend and I shared a three meat combo and paid less then 20 each. So if you share its not that pricey! At the end they give you corn bread and it is delicious! I have been here 3 times since it opened and Ive really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Delicious. The pulled pork sandwich was awesome.  This will be our go to for a smoked pork sandwich. Can't wait to try their smoked prime rib. If you walk out hungry it is your own fault. Service was great our waitress explained about the three different BBQ sauces. The owner knows how to smoke pork. Go you will nit be disappointed."}
{"text":"Third trip did not disappoint. Food was fantastic as usual and our server Miles was equally as fantastic. Beef ribs are to die for and those Qrolls WHAAAAAAT! Thanks again guys, see you soon."}
{"text":"Excellent bar-b-que. I had the sampler platter today, the baby back ribs fell off the bone before I could get them to my mouth. The pulled pork and sausage are very good! The best BBQ I've had in Arizona. Finally some good BBQ in the East Valley."}
{"text":"We will be back. There is usually something lacking when I go out out...whether it falls on service, food, atmosphere or something in between BUT Bobby-Q was sublime. Our server Anthony welcomed us, asked if we have ever been in, and have us a history of the establishment. From the proprietors name, their smoking duration, mesquite wood that is used, everything down to the steaks..nicely done and was genuine with his enthusiasm. My girlfriend sprung for a watermelon water cocktail, while I opted for the amber ale that pairs well with the food. Aside from that, we ordered a calamari to start and The Whole Hog. The entree is a more than generous variety of things to choose from like Ribs, then a second choice of meats and 3 sides. We went, baby back/ beef ribs, sausage/ brisket, then fries/ mac & cheese/ beans. Calamari was served perfectly cooked, not soggy, not tough, and not over breaded. Not too far after the main course was served. Upon noticing that the ribs we got were St. Louis ribs and baby back, Anthony vocalized before I even said it. He encouraged to begin our meal, that he would find out what happened and make it right. He did come back promptly with a plate of the beef ribs that we missing and never hinted that the extra ribs that we were served needed to be taken back or charged for. In fact within 5 minutes of that happening, the GM came to our table to apologize about the mix up, again with a genuine empathetic acknowledgement. Aside from all of that which was handled professionally, the food....SPOT ON. I used to be in the bbq/smoking scene for years, and it used to be all that I did..believe me when I tell you, Bobby-Q is what a lot of countless barbeque restaurants try to be but just aren't. You can taste the technique in the brisket, nothing is overwhelming about the smoke, and the food is so tender that I could have easily cut it with a napkin if I chose. The fries were good, beans were heaven, and that mac & cheese is silky and addictive. Can't praise the food enough, almost went behind the line to kiss the pit master.  That said, service all night was on point. Not speaking of the mix up and tableside visit from the GM, but Anthony was on top of his water service as well as checking in on us regularly. It was not overbearing nor did we feel neglected at all, it was perfect. They give out cornbread with your meal which was divine, and they send you home with fresh cinnamon sugar doughnuts. Those doughnuts are insane. Fresh, light, almost like a lighter version of the best churro you've ever had.  I will be back. I will tell everyone to eat here. I will bring people from out of town to enjoy this place. If you are reading this, just drop the act like you will find better and just GO. For what I got in terms of food, atmosphere and overall experience the pricing fits and justifies the means.  Worthy of 10 stars, but can only put up 5."}
{"text":"We love this place .. 1st time here !!Chris and Chris were the best bartenders  ever !!  We loved the happy hour .. The sliders are must !! Can't wait to come back !"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ! We got a ton of items from pork, brisket, baby backs, St. Louis ribs, BBQ chicken, mashed potatoes, beans, mac and cheese, queso... the list goes on. It was all pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Went to lunch from work and thought the restaurant and staff were great! Pulled BBQ chicken sandwich was great and so was the coleslaw. My friends got the slider and salad combos, and they were very large portions! We also got baked potato soup, and it was delicious as well. Cornbread that they give you at the beginning was warm and yummy! Tiny doughnuts at the end were great! Will definitely go back! The building inside is beautiful and nice patio area"}
{"text":"The BBQ is fabulous!!!!! It's definitely not baked !! The restaurant is very calming & relaxing  great for an after work bite or drink. The peach special is to die for. They have different events during the week. I ha e not attended any of those. The servings are enough to share !"}
{"text":"On the pricier side for BBQ but I've been here many times and it's totally worth it. Make sure you get the Q-Rolls. Everything I've tried from the ribs to the pulled pork to the pecan coleslaw are all delicious."}
{"text":"Had a good meal here with coworkers while in town for business. The fresh cornbread and donuts were excellent. The brisket was tender and smokey, but my ribs and pulled pork smoked too long and almost mushy. The pecan slaw was fresh and a nice twist, while the baked beans were lacking in flavor. Service was classy and prompt. Overall a good experience, but possibly the most expensive BBQ I have had. If prices were lower, I could go with 4 stars, but the value is only moderate."}
{"text":"Love this place. Beautiful bar and great food. It's tucked back in the corner of the lot but once you get there it's worth it."}
{"text":"Went to this place for my mother in law's birthday. The ribs were delicious and the portions were huge.  The brisket was really good too!  It was a little loud, but, well worth every penny.  Plus the owner came over to personally check on us and introduce himself."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The spinach dip was okay but the garlic bread that accompanied it was awesome.  My husband and son shared the Ribeye Steak. They said it was delicious, tender and cooked exactly like they requested. My other son and I had the Classic Hamburger. Best burger EVER hands down. Was simple without any bells or whistles, perfectly cooked, juicy and enough for 2. Austin, our waiter was AMAZING...attentive and personable.  He even brought the kids an extra bag of donuts before we left. Overall the perfect dinner. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I no longer have to drive over an hour to get some Bobby Q! East valley people rejoice, quality BBQ in a very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere is now in Mesa. I just had the pulled pork sandwich with ranch beans. The pork was tender and moist with a nice smoke flavor. They put on just the right amount of sauce so you could still taste the meat. The beans were also very good with chunks of meat in them as well. The corn bread was slmost too moist because spreading some butter on it made it crumble. Now I'm staring at my togo donuts wondering if I'm too full to eat them...."}
{"text":"Food and service was fantastic.  The owners must have put a ton of money into the place because it looks awesome.  Hot smoked prime rib was the best prime rib ive ever had (and ive had  a lot...!)  Would have given 5 stars, however drink menu had no pricing and we felt totally over charged for drinks....:(  Nice touch at the end with greasy hot donuts (comp)!  Will absolutely go back, just skip the booze."}
{"text":"I'm so excited to finally try this place. Definitely lives up to the reviews. We shared a three meat platter (ribs, brisket, and sausage) with the Mac and cheese and grilled veggies. Our server - Madison was very attentive and fast. We even got the cinnamon sugar donuts to go!"}
{"text":"First time here and very pleasantly surprised.  Excellent atmosphere and great service.  Absolutely loved our 2 meat plate with brisket and ribs.  Cornbread and donuts for dessert were very satisfying.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out!! The atmosphere & staff are top notch, but the BBQ itself.. very little smoke to the pulled pork if any. My husband had the brisket.. again not a lot of bark/ ring.. no smoke. Very disappointed with the whole plate."}
{"text":"Sat outside front door in a car called because I have an injured hip that is in pain. Called restaurant to make sure there was room and no wait. Receptionist said it depends how soon you get here but we aren't on a wait. We were the next people through the front door and the gal tells us they are on a 45 minute wait. Not cool. The Manager did come out and apologized and offered a gift card. Which was nice. But still a terrible experience."}
{"text":"OMG THEY SERVE A DRINK IN A PINEAPPLE!!! It's $15 but how many people can say they drank out of a pineapple? I mean coconuts are pretty common but pineapples?? It was absolutely glorious! Did I mention that it comes with an extra bendy, bendy straw? Because it does! The food was also very good! They start you off with some cornbread which is very good, not at all dry and they serve plenty of butter. The staff is amazing, there was a bit of a snafu with my order but absolutely no trouble the server took care of it.  The meat does come with sauce already on it but they also offer other sauces that you can have. I tried the carolina one and both the house and carolina were very good and flavorful. I ordered the 3 meat platter and it's huge, plenty to easily split with another person."}
{"text":"My sons and I have been fans of Bobby Q's since we first visited the one off I-17, but it was about a 45-minute drive away, depending on traffic.  Imagine how thrilled I was to know one just opened 15 minutes down the street from me! In a word, the food is amazing.  We always get the Q-Rolls to start (two platters) and the cornbread.  My eldest son gets the babyback ribs and fries.  My youngest son likes to change it up, but he really likes the Southern Fried Chicken.  Our favorite sides are the roasted corn and ranch beans.  The beans have shreds of beef or pork, and they are to DIE for.  My favorite is their 8-oz top sirloin, because to be honest, it's just as good as any higher-priced steak they have.  Medium is perfect, and so tender.  We always have plenty of leftovers, and always take them home, along with the mini-cinnamon donuts.  Always have an after-dinner coffee because wherever they get it, it's a phenomenal roast (and I'm a coffee snob). The wait staff is top-notch and very attentive!  The three of us can spend $100 with the appetizers, entrees and a beer each, but it's worth EVERY penny.  We will be regulars!!"}
{"text":"5 STARS WITHOUT A DOUBT ***** From the moment we got there until we left we were treated as valued guests by management and our lovely waitress Heather.  We informed our waitress this was our first time at Bobby-Q's and she gave a splendid introduction of both the menu and the company's history and reputation (which it most definitely lives up to). We started our visit with pulled pork rolls that were a perfect combination of a crunchy wrap and tender meat. We also ordered smoked wings which came with sauces on the side which was cool because it gives us choices (ranch, bbq, hot sauce) instead of having them pre-smothered in sauce. Me and my grandmother shared a two meat meal and it still managed to satisfy our appetites..the brisket is so well marinated and tender. Oh and the cornbread! *heart eyes* SOOO GOOD. me and my family are frequent restaurant goers however we all agree this is definitely one of the best restaurants we've ever been to. good vibes and good food! We'll for sure be back around Christmas time, happy holidays and happy eating :)"}
{"text":"Finally, a great BBQ place in the East Valley. Everything was perfectly delicious! I did like the baby back ribs better than the St. Louis. The burger was huge. The mac and cheese is to die for. They give you free cornbread for the table which was very moist and tasty. Our server, Huntley, was exceptional. The manager, Dan, checked on us and very pleasant and kind.  My only complaint is that they didn't have any of their donuts ready :("}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere new to try and, originally, I pegged this as just another BBQ joint. I was proven wrong pretty much immediately. Our waiter, Garrett, was probably the best part of the experience. Customer service was awesome, he had an awesome personality and gave us an overview and some suggestions since it was our first time. Overall just made it a fun experience. Now the food... you start with complimentary cornbread and butter and it is delicious. My wife ordered the burger and fries and raved about it for days. I ordered the Ribs and Brisket with Mac and Cheese and Potato Salad. All of it exceeded my expectations. The meat was tender and fell right off the bone and it was the type of meat that didn't need bbq sauce to taste great. Not to discount the sauce that they make there and was also very tasty. All of the sides were good, the portions were great, the Mac and cheese was possibly my favorite. And the icing on top of the whole experience... mini donuts! Can it get more epic than that!? You get free mini donuts when leaving and they taste amazing! Highly recommend this place to anyone! Awesome people, awesome food, and awesome mini donuts!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great astomspre. Excellent service. And even better food. Would defiantly recommend this restaurant. Try the ribeye!!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience.  4 1/2 stars.  Dinner for 7 on a busy Saturday. Requested the patio, which was lovely. Even though it was a cool February evening, the heaters are placed to maximum effect and our table remained very comfortable as the temperature dropped lower.  Our waiter was great; more than accommodating regarding a split meal and special request. Entrees were out in very short order: didn't even have time for awkward side-eyes over who got the last of the tasty cornbread served with our beverages.  Entrees and sides were all delicious: SL ribs, baby backs, brisket, chicken, pulled pork, beans, slaw, grilled veg, potato, wedge salad...nothing but repeated satisfied noises all the way around the table.  Some quibbles are possible, but compared to the overall experience, just aren't worth mentioning.  As we slowed down and boxed up everything that remained, two small bags with sugar-dipped fresh-from-the-fryer bite-sized donuts appeared. Perfect way to say \"thank you\" and \"please come again\".  Ok, based on this experience, we certainly will! One important note: do yourself a HUGE favor and make a reservation via the Yelp app. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Bobby Q is a spot I pass by every week I go to church. I was told by several people they have some of the best BBQ in the valley. My best friend was in town so I thought I would try it out with a fellow Texas BBQ lover.   We got in the restaurant quickly, the manager greeted us and sat us on the patio. The patio was clean and had the NFL playoff games on. The cornbread was warm and soft, very tasty (try not to eat too much of it). Our waiter was a cool dude. Very helpful and knew the menu back and forth.   We ordered the Q Rolls (brisket rolls), they were awesome. I wish they had cheese in them but needless to say the brisket was great and the shell was nice and crispy. I ordered the smoked chicken with Mac and Cheese and Fries. The whole meal was delicious.   The manager came back to greet us while we were eating and talked to use for about 15 minutes. She was very funny and very nice to talk to.   The whole experience was positive and the food was good. The chicken was even juicy the next day when I ate the leftovers. Great Spot!"}
{"text":"A true gem.   do not sit in bar area to dine......way too hot    Food is awesome.  I personally like the egg roll things for appetizer.  This last time there, i shared the \"HOG HEAVEN\" with my sister and it was enough food for a family of 4 adults..........Prime brisket (suggest requesting lean)  Their baby back ribs are top shelf, and i like their sausage also.   some banana dessert is supposed to be great too (I\"m not a sweets person)"}
{"text":"First time here and was very impressed by the quality of food, service, and atmosphere.  Good for kids, family, or a date (bar area).  Really enjoyed the decor and lounge feel in the bar.  Wish we had one in Southern California."}
{"text":"Best BBQ on this side of Texas! The brisket and St. Louis style ribs are amazing. It is hard to pick a favorite sauce too!  The Mac and cheese is a true experience and their burgers are as tender as softened butter. Plus they have a lot of craft beers and amazing mixed drinks as well. Everything from the atmosphere to the extremely friendly staff makes this place a tier above others."}
{"text":"Great and awesome find for my birthday. Super appetizers and cornbread and family platter enough for three or four absolutely delish! Fair price and lots of food. Very friendly staff- looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"We really like this place, have hosted several parties here. So what's the complaint? Tonight's service almost spoiled what should have been a no brainer meal. After being seated, and watching servers go by for almost 10 minutes, I asked a server walking by for a server. She then says SHE is our server, and took the order. I'm just guessing, but she acted  mentally impaired. Had to ask for everything, no attention from her. Finally, after I told her our fries arrived cold, the Mgr. came over and brought some fresh ones. Ribs were overcooked, almost mush. Disappointing all around. Don't you hate it when a favorite place goes to hell?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visit Bobby Q every time we come to Arizona, this place is amazing and has excellent food excellent service. Our waitress Olga was great!! She's friendly and was on top of the refills. Thanks again and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ok, I've been to some good BBQ spots... but #bobbyq is def one of the best eateries!  AJ, our awesome server is hands down one of the best wait staff I've encountered! He led us down a BBQ journey I won't soon forget! His advice on drinks was spot on, I totally loved the Q-Lada and my hubs drink (mile high) was fabulous too!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had dinner here last night (Friday) for the first time.  Great place, yummy food and very nice staff. Will definitely come again.  The cornbread is fantastic. Excited to eat our left overs for lunch today."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Bobby Q. We weren't really impressed with the food. Our family shared the Whole Hog Heaven. The beef ribs were really really fatty and undercooked so they made us some new ones. We really didn't taste the smokey flavor that it was supposed to have so that was kind of disappointing. The ribs and chicken seasoning was too salty. The home made mac and cheese ended up being pasta with Velveeta cheese. Not what I would consider home made. The corn bad was amazing and The service and environment was great, but I don't think we will be returning here."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! Warm greeting from the hostesses and our server was extremely friendly and attentive throughout our entire experience. She did a great making us feel special and went out of her way to engage with our baby too.   Food was delicious! We came during lunch and got the combo to split. It came with a side and there are several to chose from. The combo was plenty for two people- especially with a side salad or appetizer. Loved the cornbread which was served warm with butter...yummm! The ribs were my favorite meat but all were tasty, tender, and flavorful. Such a nice touch that they fry fresh mini donuts at the front and give you a few in a bag upon checking out.   We'll definitely return! Great dining experience."}
{"text":"Our neighbor took us to Bobby Q - raving about how great the food is - and they were right. Delicious. Large portions. Fairly priced. Ribs and brisket and sides - and donuts for dessert that come with every meal. Walked out feeling very satisfied and happy. We will return."}
{"text":"This spot is what customer service is all about! We didn't know it was grand opening tonight but first impressions are what last. Got greeted with warm smiling hostesses. Ours even asked how our day was!   We had a great server named Zack. He answered all questions and explained everything in detail.  Now for the important part...FOOD! Get the beef Texas ribs! Lots of meat and so tasty. Finger licking good! Pulled pork was good but could use a little more lovin'. Cornbread so delish! Roasted veggies need a little more flavor for me. Mac and cheese was cheesy but mediocre for my taste.   Sure they are all working out the kinks but this place is beautifully done. And we definitely will be returning. Manager and the owner Bobby came and checked how our service was too. Classy!  And check out their social area! Cozy couches with a not stuffy lounge feel. So nice!  ***AND they give little baby doughnuts to go!!***"}
{"text":"This is some seriously good BBQ. The brisket and pulled pork are extremely tender with a nice smoky flavor."}
