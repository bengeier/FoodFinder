{"text":"The squared pies and the box it comes in makes it easy to eat on the go. 

I tried the jalape√±o chicken and chicken pot pies in the big size. They were filling but the small ones would've been a great snack. 

There are about 15-20 seats inside and the decor is math (pi) and science themed. Each table also had a photo of famous mathematicians."}
{"text":"Pie squared is a little restaurant on bloor street. The pie is flat out amazing. The PS3 combo was the best. I had the chicken pot pie. It was by far the best pie place in Ontario, maybe even Canada! The next thing is the desserts. The desserts are gourmet, and pie squared has a amazing selection of desserts to choose from. For a pie place, pie squared has a great selection of \"sippin' soups\" and drinks. Other pie places don't have as much selection as this place. But this is the best pie place I have been to in a very long time."}
{"text":"Great pies. Was hoping pricing would be cheaper and I'd be going back.  Gotta love the freshness...recommended"}
{"text":"As a filling snack on the go or a sit down chat food, this is a great option! The pie pastry is soft and delicious while tr contents are cooked well and seemingly with care. As a science advocate and former dabbler in science, places like these really make me excited (pun intended). I happened upon this place during my travels on Bloor street. The scientific sign outside drew me in and the periodic table menu sealed the deal to try this place out. I ordered the special (2 pies for $8.50); we had the steak and cheese and Cheeseburger pies. It was filling, tasty and definitely a place I will return."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Finally tried it after being tempted by the smells emanating from this place whenever I walked by. Got the pie, soup and drink combo and went with the chicken & mushroom pie. The soup was some Mediterranean veggie medley type thing. 

I started with the soup. What a huge disappointment. It was one of the blandest things I've ever tasted from a restaurant. I tried putting two whole packets of salt and a packet of pepper to save it, but it was still really flat and tasteless. I ended up taking only a few sips of it and regretted wasting money on the combo. 

The pie was okay, but nothing to shout about. I've tasted similar quality pies from the frozen food section of a supermarket. 

I don't think I'll be coming back. I had high hopes for this place. Hopefully, I just happened to catch them on a bad day. Service was really friendly though, so at least there's that."}
{"text":"First time stopping by. 

Pies look great - tried jerk chicken, Guinness beef and apple crisp. Okay, so the jerk chicken was \"okay\" - not what I expected and wouldn't order it again. 

The Guinness beef was good. Didn't try the Chicken Pot, but I don't think I will.

The apple pie...well, not so much. The one pie a pie place needs to nail, and they did not.

Savoury pie prices are a bit high for the size (5 and change ea) and I get why they charge less for the apple...it's not good at all."}
{"text":"Overall, I recommend this place. It's definitely not a visit-everyday-kind of place because it's not a healthy option BUT it's definitely a lovely treat once in a while. It's definitely the type of place I might go have a snack and coffee with a girlfriend to catch up. Oh, I must say thank you to the staff for being very friendly. Sometimes these new, niche food places open up in downtown Toronto and the staff are overly pretentious.

{"text":"Having the steak and cheese pie & the apple crisp. Having made pies for a living, way back when, I can be a harsh critic. The crush is not bad, but not great. The S&C filling is very nicely seasoned and has great flavors. The AC has a lovely light crust with a touch of salt in the pastry to balance off the sweet spiced apple filling.  Nothing to return for though.

In the long run though, I would not go back.  I ended up with a funny headache afterwards and the sweetener in the apple pie left and strange sugar film in my mouth that is unpleasant."}
{"text":"Bloor location.  Street parking is a bit of a problem.  Nice guy getting the pies out around 11:20am, but told me I could have what I wanted.  Ordered a Chicken Pot Pie and a Jerk Chicken.  $12.98 total with tax.  Both shaped the same, each in a nice box whose sides fold down for eating.  Kinda neat, but I think I'm missing some of the fine features this box might have.  iPhone holder post-lunch?  Maybe missing out on some potential \"pie\" and \"box functionality\" marketing, but what do I know?  Eating the second half of the pie is a bit of a puzzle, maybe a rain dance.  After eating the first pie, I was satisfied for a \"lunch\".  Their website uses the term \"specific gravity\", which is misspelled and used in the wrong context, but I'll let that pass.  

Chicken Pot Pie:  Nice ratio of crust/top to filling, due to its designed height.  But filling is bland, and could be something spectacular.  Chicke Pot Pie often misses the mark and comes out bland.  This is one of 'em.

Jerk Chicken:  Aromatic and spicy, but I'm not sure how much it is a real Jerk.  Ginger and Allspice are evident, but doesn't seem right.  It's a very edible pie, and has much more flavour than the Chicken Pot Pie.  Glad I ate the other one first.  Long term has some heat on the tongue and lips, and some residual ginger that seems powdered instead of fresh.  

Judgement:  Nice stuff.  Needs a larger drink spectrum for the pies to seem serious.  Obviously supported by Coca-Cola, but would like to see some better drinks.  I think that if the pies are to be taken seriously, they need greater drink diversity.  Maybe some Cherry Coke, or other Coke brands.  The fillings need some work, to compare to other better renditions on the market.  I think they might have been thinking fiscally or operationally when designing these."}
{"text":"It's OK. I had the steak and cheese pie from the Yorkdale pop-up.

Pros: 
- good overall flavour 
- novel packaging/shape 

Cons:
- too much pepper, not enough cheese 
- a little expensive for the serving size 
- packaging not really practical once you've eaten half of the pie- if you've had it you'll know what i mean

I probably wouldn't have it again. Had it once so I'm all good."}
{"text":"Love the pies here.   The crust is light and flaky with great texture.   I highly recommend both the Guinness,  Beef and Potato one as well as the Chicken,  Mushroom,  Onion one.   And don't skip the dessert pies!  :)"}
{"text":"A bunch of coworkers were talking about this place so I gave it a try for lunch. I got the 2 pie special for $10. A tip - Check-In on Yelp and get one free sweet pie! 

I ordered the braised beef and jerk chicken pies. They are already prepared so if you are in rush for lunch, they is a good place. Both were very flavourful, but a tad salty. I would come back only if they continue to offer the 2 pie special. If they stop the special, I would be less inclined to return as the individual pie prices are quite steep and you have to eat at least two to be satisfied."}
{"text":"Fave would be the Guinness beef, but the steak and cheese was pretty good, although the cheese could have a stronger taste. Looking forward to trying the chicken options."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon and that was worth it - 4 savoury + 4 sweet pies for $21 (Groupon  cost + taxes paid at store).  Would not return though without the Groupon or similar discount.

Food:
- the pies in the pictures look flatter and the ones now have a bit more depth like a traditional pie.  So maybe they're bigger...unless the surface area got downsized
- have tried only their chili chicken (special of the month) so far.  Filling was good though nothing to write home about, but IMO the pastry is what really defines a pie.  In this case it was only OK...and the bottom was, while not soggy, not even close to crispy; may be a factor of the deeper pie. Perhaps I'm being unfair though, can't stop comparing it to Kanga's pastry crust which is so delicious
- I'm not a big eater and one pie would only be enough for a snack

This isn't a full-service restaurant but I'm compelled to comment on service nonetheless.  Came in on a Monday evening and I was literally in the store alone for a good 5 minutes wondering where the staff was before the lone kid working came in from having a smoke.  Asked which flavours they have left and he said just the ones in the warming display up front.  When asked what about that tray of pies I see cooling in the back behind you (duh I'm not blind), that's when he admitted there were more flavours, and also that frozen ones are available.  Only when everything was packed did he mention that, by the way, we're all out of bags.  Was already carrying a purse and a bag and since the pies were packed in 4 aluminum containers that measured ~12\" x 6\" x 4\" this last minute admission was somewhat annoying.  I do want to mention that he did take very good care in packing the pies but the other behaviour left a sour taste."}
{"text":"Around the block and good for a quick in-and-out lunch.

The restaurant's decor was interesting. It had a science concept where all the pies were squared in shape and the menu is written like chemical compound names. 

They offer a variety pies, with or without combo. Since I was my first time there, I ordered a two-pie combo to try more flavours. I picked the pulled pork pie and the steak with melted cheese pie. They both came in a box that had a nice divider in the center.

The steak pie didn't have much flavour at all. It tasted slightly sour from its sauce alongside the cheese aroma. Not sure if that was supposed to be like that or had it gone bad. Moreover, there were only few little sliced steak pieces. Overall, I could taste more of the pie crust and layers than the actual filling. It was bland and not that good.

On the flip side, the pulled pork pie was quite good. The meat inside was quite filling to my stomach. It was soft yet not too hard to chew on. Likewise, the pulled pork meat was well sliced up and the content was saucy with a good mix of sweet and sour sauce.

The two-pie combo to me was like 50/50 (one good one bad) and came up to $8 with tax included. I thought it was fairly pricey for its quality, even though I found the quantity just right.

As for the service, its mediocre especially since they are like a fast food pie store.

I wouldn't really come here again because of its price vs. pie quality. It's more of a gimmick food place to me."}
{"text":"Pie squared is the result of somebody having far too much money and far too little knowledge of marketing and branding. Having a theme is one thing but these guys take it way too far and not in a good way. I absolutely love pie but I couldn't even begin to like this place as hard as I tried.

Pie squared. The people who work there wear lab coats, get it? The menu is a periodic table of elements that is so intent on sticking to the theme of being a periodic table that it is nearly impossible to actually read it to place an order. The pies are square shaped, get it? I asked for a business card and guess what shape the card was in? Yeah a square.

The idea is good but the execution is terrible. It is in a dead space on Bloor street that hardly anybody walks by. The pie is dry and extremely small for the price you pay. It also sits under heat lamps for who knows how long while placing an order is far too reminiscent of trying to solve a high school math problem. 

If pie is what you sell focus on making the best pie possible and leave the gimmicks to someone else."}
{"text":"Not good.  I tried the jerk chicken pie today.  They were giving out samples in the lobby of the Richmond Adelaide Centre.  The jerk flavouring was ok and the spice was there, but that pie... 

When you think of pie, don't u think of flaky, light, crispy pastry?  This was nowhere in the slightest resemblance to that.  It was thick, heavy, and the pie was ridiculously thin.  It was dry and crumbled like dirt.  I ate the filling cuz I don't like to waste food.  The chicken was dry.  I threw out the crust cuz it was gross.  

I thought samples are given out to create a buzz, to generate interest by those who haven't tried yet, to put your best foot forward to entice a new fan base...  They failed miserably in this case.  The crust just wasn't for me.  

I'm not a chef but I've made savoury pies.  You wanna see a picture of what a real savoury pie should look like?  Message me, I'll show you."}
{"text":"If my high school science class was this cool , I probably would have paid more attention!!! I was highly disappointed with this place. I love love love pie and what I got tasted like  shelf life cardboard. I love the design, ambiance and location of the store however the actual pie's were nothing to write home about . Very disappointing  and my hunt for great pie in the city continues."}
{"text":"This place is located west of Yonge and Bloor. Like, in the middle of nowhere. Probably only people that work in the area would know about it, which is a bit unfortunate: I feel that if they had a better location they would get more foot traffic. But then again, given how long it takes to prepare a batch of pies...it'll probably be like uncle tetsu on bay kind of place where you see people waiting for hours to get an item if they actually did get more foot traffic.

There's a distinct orange color theme going on in the store. There's a lot of seating, and overall well-maintained and clean. The washrooms were also nice and clean.

They offer savoury and sweet pies, along with tarts, coffee, and soup. A savoury pie costs $6, which is comparable to other pie places such as Kanga. They have a couple deals that you could take advantage of if you're looking to get multiple pies. 

We came in around 6:15 PM and the person ahead of us grabbed the last 3 pies that were left in the warmers. It was literally empty. The baker informed us that another batch of pies were coming up in 15 minutes, so we decided to wait for it. Nothing better than fresh-out-of-the-oven savoury pies, right? They also sell frozen pies that you can take home to bake yourself, so that is an option as well.

The baker explained that it takes 30-40 minutes to prepare a batch of pies, so if you're planning on getting something, you should call in ahead of time so that they will have time to prepare your pies. They also do foodora so you could probably get it delivered.

From the batch of pies, several were already reserved for other customers that had called ahead, so we ended up getting two chicken pot pies, a guiness pie, and a steak and cheese pie. We also grabbed two chocolate banana pies and two apple krisp pies. 

I enjoyed the savoury pies. They come with a lot of filling, especially the meat pies had more than a couple spoonfuls of meat which is quite generous. I think they have more filling than the ones from Kanga. The sweet pies were alright; I'm not a fan of chocolate banana, but the apple krisp was pretty good.

One thing I noticed is the pictures show flat square pies, but the ones we ordered were thick, square pies. I'm not sure why they're different.

Overall, it's a nice place. $6 a pie seems a bit steep, but some of the combos make it a bit better. They've also been around for 3 years so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Came across their pop up store at Yorkdale. Got to try their jerk chicken, and spinach pie. Both were delicious but my favourite was jerk chicken. It had a bit of a kick with the spice, and as I bit into it, it had an explosion of flavours that was just right!!! Definitely a must try!! Wish they had the chicken pot pie. Hopefully they'll have some next time!"}
{"text":"I first discovered this place by reading about it in a magazine and realizing it was relatively close to home.  I waffled on giving it 3 or 4 stars, but ultimately decided it deserved the 4.

There are a few obvious good things about Pie Squared.  Number 1 - it's cheap, and remarkably so for this area of town.  Two pies and a drink come in under $10 which is an excellent deal, especially since the pies are decent sizes.  There are a few combos that you can have - all of them reasonable in price.  Number 2 - all of the food is clearly homemade in the kitchen.  In addition to their meat pies, their dessert pies aren't to be missed!

While some pies are generally better than others (the cheeseburger one tasted a little too processed, but the steak and cheese one is excellent), most of the food here is quite good.  I've seen a few different varieties rotate into their consistent menu.

Overall, if you are looking for a filling, cheap lunch or dinner I would recommend this place.  The quality is good, the prices are great and I generally walk away quite satisfied."}
{"text":"Cute packaging & good for on the go - especially people who work in the area who need to grab a quick bite. Bought this home and reheated in the oven the next day. Honestly no wow factor & very pricey. Honestly wouldnt get it again unless it was nearby for convenience sake."}
{"text":"I almost never visit this area but since I had a groupon, I decided to give this place a try. 4 savoury and 4 sweet for something like $21 total with tax.

8 pies is a lot for 2 people. I would say 2 pies can be a meal. We ate it over 2 days. 

I would say the savoury pies are significantly better than the sweet pies. And this is coming from me, who has a significant sweet tooth. The texture of the dough just doesn't go well with the fillings. I am left with a very dry feeling afterwards.

I think my favourite would have to be the guiness meat pie. I can't tell exactly what's inside (that's the nature of pies I guess), but it was damn good. I would say you can't go wrong with any of the savoury ones. We had 4 different ones and all were good. 

What kills this place is probably the price point. I wouldn't pay $6 for these pies. But not that I come to this area in general anyways."}
{"text":"Very nice idea as food serving. Good, but not the best. I found it too be too much taste in one small calory bomb pie."}
{"text":"Tried it again and it was almost inedible. Way way way Too much salt and the pies looked old in the display. Are they selling day olds as new? They need to put more effort into the consistency or im not coming back :("}
{"text":"I didn't really give this place a through review.  This are like pies but more like a stuffed pocket sandwich, the crust is soft and good. The g filling is good, I really only had breakfast so far hence why I found this place

This trip was a to go order but the take home box was nice. Even gives you storing and heating instructions but I have eaten on and will eat the second one soon

Any geek will enjoy the science and fake element behind it but I think I they got the science of baking the perfect pie right. It's in their slogan so I hope they would"}
{"text":"So I'm not the biggest pie fanatic, but this place is just so cool!  I work right by Bloor and Church and I hate walking towards Yonge as there are so many people and the crowd is just insane, so it is nice to have a place east of Church that has good food.  

I saw this place on Yelp recently as \"Hot and New\", so I had to check it out. I was not disappointed.  

Likes:
-Pies are cleverly designed and the logos are cool! 
-I thought the pie holder would create a mess, but in actuality, it was quite helpful. I barely spilled anything on the table!  
-The atmosphere is trendy, like a coffee shop.  
-Owner is very accommodating.  I got a Pulled Pork Pie (OMG, this was heaven in a square) for $5 and it was so good, I wanted to try something else.  Little did I realize that they had a combo where you can two entree pies for $7.08 plus tax ($8 total).  I asked since I ordered that one pie, if I could get the combo if I got another pie (smoked meat - it was decent). He said sure, I'll just charge you the difference. Really appreciate that.  
-They have an assortment of pies, from sweets to meats to beets and they are so into the deets. (I'm not sure if they actually have beet, but I meant vegetarian - just trying to be funny).
-They also have coffee, smoothies, salad and soup.  
-An assortment of combos so you can get a full lunch out of it.  

Dislikes: 
-Minor complaint, but the menu is kind of over the entre store so it's a bit hard to decide what to get.

Verdict: One of the best meat pies I've ever had. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Making it's grand debut on the commercial strip across Greenwin Square's main Bloor Street East entrance, PieSquared is a unique dining option for those who live and work in the area.  The restaurant sells meat, vegetarian, and fruit-filled pies (similar to Jamaican beef patties, but only difference is they're not yellow, they're pressed, and each of them is labeled similar to the universally used table of elements.  

Two pies (meat or vegetarian) are $8 and they're served in a neat little box if you're on the run. Service is great, restaurant has a nice modern, yet chic look, and the cash register is an iPad on a pedestal (first time I've seen an iPad used for this purpose).

I tend to for the vegetarian pies (Moroccan vegetable and Spinach and Lentil, however their chicken pies are also tasty). If you're in the vicinity, and looking for a meal that will vcarry you for the day and is not a commercial fast food joint, try this spot out. The restaurant is located next door to the Taco Del Mar restaurant that opened last year.

Please be aware the 905 number that appears on their Yelp! listing is incorrect. Their correct number is (647) 350-2743. Their official site (www.piesquared.com) is also down but should be up sometime soon. In the meantime you can visit their official Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pie-Squared/1492344517650283?fref=nf."}
{"text":"Had the cheddar chicken Jalapeno square with the secret sauce ... It was bad but I wasn't really into it... I'll stick to sheppard pie"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here last week. The hot pies were tasty, but I took a mini blueberry square to go and when I got home I found mould spores on the bottom parts of the crust! They should be more careful with the items that they are keeping at room temperature."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Greeted nicely as I got in. Everything was explained to me as far as choices, combo options and specials. I got the chicken, cheddar and jalape√±o pie with the apple crisp dessert pie. With a drink 7.25. Not bad. The portions were not big, but it was quality. And for lunch just the right size. The CCJ pie was flavourful with good size chicken. Some spice. The best part was the shell. Buttery. Flaky but not too flaky. The apple crisp was par. But again...that pastry.  Yum. 

Thinks I don't care for. Plastic knife and fork. For staying in and sitting I want a real k and f. Same goes for paper plates. But not a deal breaker since it has no impact on the food. 

Would I go back. Yes. There were many other pies that looked awesome."}
{"text":"Wow, for a place that specializes in pies, their PIES ARE REALLY BAD! I tried the Guinness, Steak, and Potato pie for $6.97. The only thing unique about it is that the pie shape is square and comes in a little box that you can eat without utensils. The pie crust isn't crispy at all and the bottom soggy. The inside is only lukewarm and tastes and looks like thickened Chunky beef stew soup. The pie itself is tiny and I could easily eat three of these for lunch and still be hungry. But at almost $8 after tax, I wouldn't do so even if these pies were delicious, which they most certainly are not.

For good pies, I highly recommend the Brick Street Bakery on the lower level of the First Canadian Place (in front of the Longo's). They have steak, chicken, turkey, and Sheppard's pie, all of which I have tried and tastes far better than this place. Not only that, Brick Street's pies are bigger and cheaper than this place.

For a place that only makes pies, you would think that they would be able to do the one and only thing they do reasonably well. Sadly, they can't even do that! Will never come back!"}
{"text":"Decided to indulge my taste buds on Pie Day (March 14th). Where better to find the perfect pie then 'Pie Squared'.

When I arrived it was extremely busy do to the $3.14 special (All pies on March 14th are $3.14) on behalf of this glorious day!

I ordered a chocolate banana pie and the apple pie. I would have ordered a savoury pie but they were sold out by 10:30am. A bit disappointing since today is Pie Day and most places would expect a large surge in customers. The chocolate banana pie is best described as a whole banana that had been mushed into a pie shell. It tasted exactly like that, a mushed banana :(

I'm still working up the courage to try the Apple. Hopefully it is an explosion of flavour:)

Would I come back? I might try a savoury pie but I would definitely not order a sweet pie again."}
{"text":"Tried the Guinness Beef pie. You couldn't taste the Guinness at all! It was all just really dry meat for the filling. The pie crust was good. Definitely won't be getting the Guinness Beef again but I'm open to trying out other flavours."}
{"text":"Had the pies at the Yorkdale concept pop up and can't give a proper review yet! I ordered two chicken pot pies, one steak Guinness pie and a butter tart bar. The chicken pie was on the dry side, I'm not sure if it's because I bought it at the end of the day being the reason behind that. I looked at other Yelper's photos and the pie filling looked moist with a great sauce combining the chicken and vegetables. The steak one was very tender, the taste was very unique and is something I would definitely go back for! 
They have really great packaging that is bound to stand out from in a crowd! 

Hopefully I will get to try the pies at this actual location and get a more fresh taste of them."}
{"text":"Work nearby and was excited to have a new spot open up but I wasn't wowed. 

Pros:
- Prices are very reasonable- $8 for 2 pies that'll fill you up
- Nice clean fresh look and fun stools 
- Good quick service 

Cons:
- Guinness pie was salty but didn't have much inside. Would have been wonderful if it had more fillings. No veggies except for onions
- menu isn't very easy to read and pies don't match. There are extra pies on display that aren't on the menu but you would have to look hard to see

Not rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I don't know if meat pies are becoming a new food trend in Toronto, but Pie Squared  got their business concept down to a science.

The pies are square, yes. Too bad Pi*r^2 is not an equation applicable to squares. Also finally a pie business in Toronto that wholeheartedly embraces International Pi Day (14th of March), albeit by design and certainly a brilliant marketing ploy for its own thematic purpose when that day came.

Tucked in a drab building in an unremarkable part of Bloor East, the geeky science theme is everywhere, from the periodic table menu to the cheeky molecule models hanging off the ceiling. All their pies and many other stuff and combos they serve are all represented with made-up elemental symbols, which are even imprinted on the pies themselves. All that is missing is a chemistry teacher managing the place--unless a chem teacher is indeed running this place, and the business serves as a front disguising an underground industrial meth lab.

Maybe, maybe not, but lest I digress. No methamphetamine for sure, but absolutely a front producing fresh square shaped hand-held snack pies, served by friendly helpful folks. Handling these things kinda reminds me of a Jamaican patty, with a crisp and flaky crust enclosing the stuffing. The sweet and breakfast pies ($2.21-2.65) are much disappointingly smaller than their mains ($3.98-4.43), with prices reflecting that fact.

Pulled pork was good, the meat well-shredded and the flavours juicy and sweet like anything pulled pork should be. Moroccan Vegetable could use a bit more spice but generally happily filling. Chocolate banana however, holy smokes it's like heaven in a postage stamp!

Fun stuff. Smart little trick is if you order takeout, they'll throw your multiple pies in a double-decker carton. Dumb little trick is going to their website and finding it is still \"under construction\" (as of this writing).

{TTC: Sherbourne subway station; it's in a drab concrete building at the NW corner of Sherbourne/Bloor beside the TD bank.}"}
{"text":"cool idea..  The food/product was tasty.
It's a brutal corner (ugly/cold/concrete..)
so it's nice to see something different setting up shop (beyond the AWFUL subway, starbucks, taco del mar places..).
Staff very helpful, friendly."}
{"text":"Pie Squared actually just opened up a pop up shop at Yorkdale Mall in Toronto. This is a great opportunity people to experience their pies without traveling downtown. 
They have a variety of flavors ranging in three categories: savory, sweet and periodic. 

Price:
For the size of the pies, I would say that it is quite expensive. Each pie ranges from 4-6 dollars before taxes. 

Pros:
- Their menu makes it easy for people to decide. Because they have three categories with distinct flavors, people are able to decided what they prefer/ crave. 
- The size and packaging makes the pies very easy to eat
- The workers there are quite nice and are able to explain all the different types of items sold 

Cons: 
- pricing is quite high for the portion you are getting 
- pies are hard to eat right away as they are very warm when you first purchase them
- I felt like the quality was not wow enough for me to come back and try something else"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and fell for their pies the first time. The individual sized sweet pies are the perfect after dinner treat. Although, I haven't tried their savory pies, their banana chocolate is delicious, along with the lemon coconut pie square. The pastry is light and not dry. A must try if you are in the area. I will be back."}
{"text":"the staff was very nice but the pie tasted like a microwaveable hot pocket that you can get from Walmart for 2$ ive had better and for 7$ tax? meh"}
{"text":"I have been to their pop-up shop at Yorkdale a few times and their Bloor St. Location a handful of times. Place is usually pretty empty but I don't have a tendency to go during peak dining periods. They only make a certain number of each type of pie everyday and once it's gone, it's gone.

I have never been disappointed with what I've ordered and I've never left hungry. Off the top of my head, I've had their chicken pot pie and one of their vegetarian options. Both were flavourful and filled with creamy, well-spiced combinations. They also have convenient, single serving pouches to make for easy snacking.

Price point is reasonable. Service is friendly and atmosphere is casual. Unfortunately, I think I've run out of varieties of pie that pique my interest. If I'm looking for a quick bite in the Bloor and Sherbourne area, I'll definitely pop in again."}
{"text":"I had the Banana Chocolate pie. It was good and did not make me feel sickly-sweetly-full after. The filling is not a gooey mess but actually a tasteful mix.  The crust is good.

I had a raspberry tart recently which was okay. 

I am going back for a savory pie soon. ...Um...Goat Cheese something....

TWO DAYS LATER
I went back ..had the Goat, Cheese, Egg pie square and it was perfect. I think this is about to become the place where I am going to pick up food while passing by. 

Customer service both days was great.

ONE DAY LATER 

Picked up the Sweet Chili Chicken pie and Banana Chocolate pie again. I asked about their spiciest pie and Sweet Chili was recommended. It is their monthly special and not listed on the Board. Good taste. As for being Spiciest......er....Nope."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a month.  The pies are like advanced hot pockets and I don't mean that in a bad way.  They are delicious and have fairly complex flavours.  They also constantly tweak the recipes and rotate special periodic pies so it never gets old.  They even do surveys to get feedback on new pies or something they adjusted.  The chicken curry pie was pretty good when they launched it. But they recently adjusted the spicing and now it's great.

The pies also reheat well and can be great post bar snacks for later.  Glad to have this place near us!  Staff are super nice and it's a good value especially with the stamp card."}
{"text":"I thought the concept of portable pies was great and the way they make their pies like the periodic table is very creative! I came here twice already to try a few different pies and while it's a great concept, I didn't find that the pies were beyond amazing. Don't get me wrong, they tastes good, just not amazing. My coworker thought the same. Some pies are on the drier side but that's the nature of portable pies - can't leak fillings! The last pie I tried was the cheeseburger pie which was a bit disappointing. I was expecting ground beef with lots of gravy and cheese rather than a whole burger patty and minimal sauce. Taste wise, it was kind of plain but I could be biased since I had high expectations in this pie. The butter tart was delicious though. 

The customer service is top notch. The cashier explained how everything works, the pie selection and gave me a coupon and a loyalty card to keep me coming back. Great marketing/promotion there. It did bring me back several times.

If you're looking for a place to grab a quick lunch, this place would be it. I think their sweet pies are their strengths though."}
{"text":"My friend and I passed this little place a few weeks ago and commented on the name, and were interested enough to do some research. When we happened to be in the neighbourhood again shortly afterwards, we decided to check it out. The man behind the counter was friendly, the place was clean. I ordered the spinach and lentil pie. Oh. My. Gawd. So delicious. (Note: I'm not even a vegetarian, I just happen to be fond of both spinach and lentils.) I want another one and I want it soon."}
{"text":"Pie day!! I came by with a few friends to join in on the fun, and the $3.14 pie deal! This shop is located in the path connecting Hudson Bay and Bay-Adelaide Centre. The store itself is just a counter with tonnes of pies on display but there are some tables set up in the hallway outside. 

Now to the review of the pies themselves. The pie crust is formed into a square, and sits nicely in the box. It's a nice idea but when you get to the bottom half of the pie, the box design makes it hard to eat on the go. A spoon would be recommended if you don't want to savagely pick up the pie filling from the bottom of the box with your fingers. Other than the square shape, there really isn't anything distinctive about the crust. It's quite thin and just there to hold the filling temporary. It's soft, not very buttery, and not very flaky. 

Out of the savory pies, I got the pulled pork, and chicken pot pie. Pulled pork one was the better of the two. There were very large pieces of tender pork that was cooked perfectly. Flavor wise, instead of the typical BBQ sauce, it tasted more like a ketchup based sauce with strong onion flavor. The chicken pot pie did not have as much filling and was not as memorable. Skip the chocolate banana pie. My friend got it and it was a solid chunk of filling, despite being a pretty warm pie, and not very aromatic. Overall, there are better options for pies but if you're walking by and want a quick bit, this won't be a bad option. I liked it considering I basically only paid half price for them. 

Because it was special promotion day, there were some line-ups but the wait wasn't too bad when I dropped by at 6pm. They were out a few of the options but they restocked pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and I must say it is interesting.
They have a mix of savoury & sweet pies along with salads, fruit & a coffee bar. 

I ordered 2 pies (jerk chicken & braised beef) and other than me falling asleep in the mid afternoon due to too much food, these pies were very tasty!! The owner took his time to explain what their approach was all about which I find adds to the experience as well!

If you're In the sherbourne & bloor area, pop in and you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really enjoy having a quick dinner or lunch here on the odd day!

They have great selection of both sweet and savory pies, and although they may look small, they definitely will fill you up. I find it hard to believe anyone would have a problem finding something to eat here!

Great for grabbing and go, but I personally like sitting in there. Music can be too loud sometimes but not enough to make me enjoy my time there any less."}
{"text":"Arrived here for a quick take out dinner as I was feeling lazy to cook. First pie place that I have been to but had always meaning to try. The place was quiet and the pies looked like they sat on display a bit too long. Decided to order 4 pies for a price of $18. Ordered 2 pulled pork, Guinness+meat, and a chicken/onion/mushroom. 

Heated the pies up for 7mins at 350 as instructed to. Pulled pork was definitely the best one. Nothing special or mind blowingly delicious. Not sure if I'd return as of yet, but good to give it a shot."}
{"text":"- Combos are a good deal (2 especially, offering 2 savory pies for under $9)
- Jerk chicken and pulled pork was quite good 
- Pro tip - pie day freebies !! They also offer a free pie when you check in on yelp.
- Good filling snack rather than a full meal 
- The pumpkin nut and apple krisp were delicious as well."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Pie Squared.

There are a few pies to choose from ... savory and sweet.  I ordered a Thanksgiving pie to eat in and an apple crisp pie to take home.  The to-go pie was put in a holder but I found it odd that the Thanksgiving pie, which I was going to eat there, was just put on the tray without a plate.  My Thanksgiving pie was good but seemed to be mostly dressing.  It was the right size for how hungry I was.

Doug was the server.  Though he hasn't worked there that long, he was enthusiastic and seemed knowledgeable about the pies, how they are made, etc."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I have been waiting a while for this place to open and we're finally glad they did!

As soon as we walked in we could tell that this is a great place and they put a lot of thought into the branding if the company.

They've got pies coming out the Wa-Zhou for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Dessert. If pies aren't what you fancy, there are salads and soups to whet your appetite.

The staff was knowledgeable and really were eager to get feedback on their product. It smelled heavenly in there and if I did work there I definitely gain a few pounds for sure.

The pies are well sized and much easier to eat than I had anticipated. Serious thought when into their packaging and how they present them selves. A great job for early marketing of this place.

The product speaks for itself here and tastes just as good as it smells. Pricing was spot on for what I ordered (2 entree pies and 1 dessert) for $10.00 +tax (roughly). I'm definitely full after my meal! YUM! I found the pastry a bit dry and was hoping that maybe there was some kind of sauce or gravy one could use or be offered to create a more complete experience here.

I seriously can't wait for the winter and going here to get a hearty meal to get me through those cold days/night.

People of Toronto! You Pie G-d has heard you and given us Pie Squared! Rejoice!"}
{"text":"Finally this subway corner is getting some life in its restaurant/food scene. I don't know why it's taken so long considering all of the large businesses in the area. Anyways this is a great addition to the neighborhood in that it's a different kind of food to choose from. 

Pie Squared is a brilliant piece of marketing. Each pie is given a fake periodic table name and is baked in the form of a square. Much like Kanga: Aussie Meat Pies, these pies can be easily held and are the perfect snack on the go.

As you can imagine with all that pastry, they're surprisingly flling! Furthermore the prices are pretty fair (and cheaper than other pie places in Toronto). I grabbed a meat pie, a can of coke, and a sweet pie for 7.75$ inc. tax. You can tell that they're using fresh ingredients and they're baked fresh each morning. Personally, I think the pies aren't as tasty as other places in Toronto (and I would suggest that they make some sauces available for people), but for the price they're very reasonable.

The servers are also really friendly and outgoing. I also quickly spoke to the owner Gino Amodio, who was also quite friendly and was clearly working hard to build up the restaurant. 

I am really positive for the outlook of this restaurant and I think people will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I love pie, and I like the concept of this place.  Cute, simple hand pies that are great for a quick lunch and can be included with a combo. There are meal pies and smaller desert pies. The aesthetic of the packaging and the pies themselves are nice, but the taste is just alright. Come here if you want a quick convenient meal and have a hankering for pie."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by to a quick snack and it was a pleasant surprise. 
The savoury pies are absolutely amazing!
Prices seems a bit high but it's definitely worth it. We had the Guinness and the Southern Pulled Pork. The filling was moist and flavoured and quite a generous portion.
We are definitely coming back to try some other flavours!"}
{"text":"Savoury pies are an obsession whenever I'm in London.  Finding one that has the amazing buttery crust that is crispy and yet tender... and then filed solid with highly flavourful meats and sauces.  Oh gosh, I'm just dreaming of sinking my teeth into another.  For Toronto, a great one is hard to find.  Though Pie Commission ranks among some of the best I've had in Europe.

Pie Squared is in the new Indulge mini food court in Yorkdale with Eva and Uncle Testu.  The spot is purely take out as there is no chairs or tables nearby.  You've got to head down the hall in front of Michels baguette for that.  I was expecting a bit more line up especially for Eva's but on a Saturday afternoon, there was none.

They claim they went to Europe to discover what it takes to make a great savoury pie.  I don't completely disagree on having the most amazing crust as that is first and last bite but your filling has got to be just as good.

They had a bunch of different savoury and sweet offerings all pre made and sitting under a heat lamp in their glass counter.  Seeing how we wanted a quick snack, we decided on a savoury choice of pulled pork.  It was not your traditional pie but rather a hand pie for about $8.  Most of their other savoury offerings was about the same price.  It was a bit pricey for the amount I've got to admit.

Pulled pork hand pie -  I'm just going to be upfront and say that it tasted like it was factory made.  Comparing it to Pie Commission, it was missing a great buttery crust, flavourful filling, and a larger pie amount.  The crust was ok but not really having any great flavour or crispness.  The pulled pork filling was tender but quite one dimensional in flavour ... kinda like Bottled sweet bbq sauce.  And the amount,  I'd say about 3 times the size of a pop tart do not really big.  For the same price at Pie Commission, you get better flavours and more.  So it's hard to even say this is better than you average fast food spot.  3/5

I like the idea of having hand pies as you're walking about but these just didn't make the cut for me.  I'm not sure any of the other pies would be great seeing how they're using the same bland and soft crust.  I think I'll stick to my favourites of Nadege for savoury pastries in the mall."}
{"text":"A new addition to this particularly dreary section of Bloor, Pie Squared seems like they should be a lot more popular than it is right now. Similar to a dedicated crepe place, they've got savoury and sweet selections for their pies.

As a lunch option, it's quite affordable and filling (2 entree pies for $8). I opted for the 1 entree + 1 dessert + 1 drink option, which cost $7.75, since I didn't want to be totally stuffed. They have savoury options like Guiness steak, pulled pork, sausage and egg, and quite a few others that all sounded delicious. I chose the pulled pork, and found the pie part was nice, flakey, perfectly baked. The filling itself has a good amount of meat, which is always a plus. Nothing is less satisfying than a meatless meat pie! The sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking - but the overall effect was yum!

Dessert pie, I chose the chocolate banana. The dessert pies are slightly smaller than the entrees, about 60% of the size, but that's a perfect pick for me. It was just...alright. Tasted good, but nothing to go out of my way for.

The service was excellent - They have a stamp card, where if you get 6 pies, you get one free! On the flip side of the same card, if you get 6 coffees, you get one free. The owner (I think it's the owner?) also gave $1 off any pie coupon, so definitely gave incentive to go back. He also threw in a \"pi\" sauce to go with the entree pie, which tastes a bit like ranch dressing. 

All in all, for less than $8, you can get a good size meal, including a dessert and drink. The packaging is consistently cool, and it's all over the store, the bags, the coffee cups, AND the pies themselves. Will be back to keep trying those entree pies!"}
{"text":"I came to the store just before 1p.m. on a Thursday and there were no more pies except for a few vegetarian ones and a pulled pork (none of the other flavours were left, maybe a total of four left). I asked the woman working there if those were the only remaining pies for the day and she abruptly said \"Yes,\" and that was it. 

I can't comment on the pies because I left without any. No chicken or steak options left.

I won't be returning to Pie Squared again. It is completely unacceptable to not have any pies during lunch hour in an area with many offices and employees. I wasted my lunch hour coming to this place and trust me, it won't happen again."}
{"text":"We used Pie Squared to cater a large party (80 people).  Huge hit with all our party guests - pies were super tasty, very filling and easy for people to eat without a mess.  Entire process - from ordering pies to accepting the delivery- was seamless and staff were very easy to work with."}
{"text":"Pies have starter tasting frozen and not freshly made. Tried multiple different ones. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"The pie's taste level I'd call closer to 2, but the price (2 for $8), selection, and friendliness bumped pie squared to a 3. If I worked around here I would definitely add this to the lunch rotation, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. We tried the Guinness steak and potato, southern pulled pork, and montreal smoked meat. The steak & potato was the favourite, nice and tender, good flavour. The pulled pork was a bit dry, the sauce was too sweet and lacked a depth of flavour. The montreal meat was tender although it too was a bit bland. 

I found a few problems overall with these pies. The dough isn't the greatest, a bit dry and one was a tad bit burnt and that flavour really carried. Many bites I had were mostly dough. The filling to dough ratio is off, I would rather pay 5 or 6 dollars for a pie that has more filling. The fillings were nice, apparently everything is made on site, but I'd like some more seasoning as all were a bit bland.

I love the concept, the periodic table theme, the price, the server was very friendly and helpful. I really wanted to love this place since I live close enough and I love meat pies, however it just didn't live up to my taste expectations."}
{"text":"Came again for Pi Day but missed the freebies. The Steak & Cheese was lukewarm and meh; should've bought the Guinness! It wasn't packed for this promo day and staff said they were more prepped today and slightly busy; about 10 people. Seems like the event vot some attention as five more walmed through the door. Btw, Foodora delivers! Honestly wouldn't Pay fullprice for these snacks but it's tasty and the neighbourhood can afford it! PostMedia across the street can easily get catered here; perfect newsie food if you're on deadline!"}
{"text":"First time trying. Tried the chicken pot pie, didn't disappoint me (or maybe I'm too hungry). It was fresh out of the oven. Will come back and try the steak & cheese one"}
{"text":"Tried the steak pie for $7 for lunch because I thought that it was very popular. The portion was small, and it was warm when I bought it. I thought that it was ok in terms of taste, it did not amaze me compared to other pies I have had. For the cost and the portion size, it is definitely overpriced. I was not full eating this pie and needed to buy something else to supplement it. The ingredients did seem fresh though and the meat was not processed, but it didn't seem worth it for the price."}
{"text":"Just to add to the previous review.  I tried a sweet chicken chilli (name is probably wrong) pie today and it was excellent.   Quite spicy and lots of flavour.  However, you need a fork for this one!"}
