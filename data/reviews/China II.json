{"text":"Worst Chinese food I have EVER had. This place should close. Nothing tasted fresh and, rude service and disgusting food. Go somewhere, don't say you weren't warned."}
{"text":"Not good! Really, not good. I had lunch here. I was so disappointed. The crab rangoon, had no crab, just a scant amount of filling.  My lunch consisteted of a neon orange rice. Strange looking, and bad tasting. The food was so bad, I thought we were being pranked."}
{"text":"Went to this location during there normal business hour. Arrived 3 hours be for there closing time. Lights were on, people inside still working, and open sign was lit. For reason the doors were locked. I personally will not be making the blink trip again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese places around.  Granted, it is a dingy little hole in the wall but I almost always just do take-out.  DELICIOUS!!! Generous portions, great value!!  Great menu!! Friendly and fast... Try the Sesame Chicken on beef lo mein ROCKS!!"}
{"text":"So today for lunch I decide to stop by; mixed reviews so I said hey why not! I should have stayed far far far far away. 
1) I ordered lunch specials and the lady upfront argued me down that I never mentioned lunch so she charged me full price for the meals! It was a 1230pm order! 

2) I ordered crab wontons- 1 small sauce for 6-8 pieces. But what was worst was that the wonton was just creme cheese and no crab! 

3) we ordered fried rice for our lunch specials,
It was mostly 4/5 rice and 1/5 meat but made to look half and half. The house rice had 3 shrimp in mine and 2 dribbles of pork and a thimble of chicken. Let's just say compared to the other order my portion was a feast lol. 

4) To top it off the food smelt funny like the pork might have been going bad before they cooked it. 

All in all this meal of two lunch specials with house fried rice and wontons and a plain noodle shouldn't have come close to $31.00, but it did! I am so disappointed! Beware of this place! I'm not sure if it's their child labor or cutting cost but that was ridiculous! We have discarded this foul meal and searching for lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not good at all.  I was there at 10:40, supposedly they open at 10:30, ordered food, asked at 10 to 11 if I could at least have my tea, the lady very rudely told me they had just opened and didn't have tea yet?  Finally brought my tea, I told her I did not want ice which she ignored, brought the wonton egg drop soup, very greasy, had chicken fried rice, which was very dry, even tried putting some of the soup on top of it."}
{"text":"It's in Belmont & the best Chinese cuisine I've had in a long time.  Everything is fresh & homemade..."}
{"text":"As far as hole in the wall Chinese takeout goes...this was my go to place for hunan chicken when I lived in the area.  They have an orange colored rice that I love.  Also had great general tso...thought the dishes surpassed all the other (and more expensive) Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Very affordable and good portions! The lady who always works at the front (I guess shes the owner) is very nice though she doesn't speak good English. Every now and then she will throw in free items with my meal. I would definitely recommend the wonton soup for this cold weather."}
