{"text":"The fry brad place we wanted to eat at was closed so we stopped at this place to eat before getting on the road back to san diego. Their menu has 11 combos, tacos , burritos and tortas. The meat options are carnitas, chicken , barbacoa, asada, pastor, lengua, and lengua. Oh, they also serve menudo, pozole , and tamales.  We ordered the enchilada combo which included 4 (chicken or cheese), rice and beans. The tacos are small tortilla tacos. They have a salsa bar with salsas and condiments.  Customer service was friendly and efficient. Food taste was good  The enchilada sauce was restaurant made, not canned like most places. Beans were very good and restaurant made, not canned.  We ordered barbacoa(beef) tacos and the meat tasted great! No heavy seasoning or condiments.  They sell american soda, mexican soda and freshly sqweezed lemonade.  Ambiance was cool. Mexican music playing, simple tables with metal chairs. The place looked like its going through a make over. It had new orange paint on walls. Oh, they do have ceiling fans and a/c!"}
{"text":"Came in they ran out of tacos the pastor and carnitas only available meat was asada if you want basic tacos come here or else find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but the problem I have with the place is the price. A $6 carne asada burrito should be much larger than it was. The $1.50 tacos were a better value and could be dressed with onions, cilantro, etc on your own at the salsa bar. If prices were better I'd likely come back."}
{"text":"Best place for Mexican food. I love their vegetarian torta and their carne asada tacos. The I always have the best service when I go. There is not I a dish that I don't like."}
{"text":"I tried all the 3 different $.50 tacos plus a normal cabeza taco. They're all the same size which I found a little surprising. All the tacos were just ok. I did try the fresh lemonade in the bottle on the counter and it was good. I did like their salsa bar a lot. Load your food up with cabbage, red onion, lime, cilantro and onions. But even with all this (think I liked the red onion the most) the tacos are just ok."}
{"text":"OMG extraordinary tacos! Don't expect fancy but authenticity. I would eat here everyday if I could. Very nice staff and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Have been going her for years awesome little place for some quick and great tasting food. If you wanna switch it up from all those franchise restaurants and fast food places then look no further this place is great and doesn't really get crowded so their isn't a wait which is a plus"}
{"text":"Food is good! great place if you want steam tacos great prices too all food taste like great homemade authentic food"}
{"text":"This is my nieces favorite taco place! We love the green steamed tacos!!!! Must try them! Very friendly people!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently delish.  Service is good and the salsa bar is on point.  I've recommended this place a number of times and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Don't go for the 50 cent tacos those are steamed tacos that while they might be good they are small and meatless. Instead try the assortment of tacos with meats or burritos. The menu is big with plenty to choose. And this place is very reasonable in price."}
{"text":"My sister wanted to try this after hearing it was really good, waste of ten dollars. Really bad. I had to throw most of it away, my daughter did the same."}
{"text":"I was honestly afraid to try this place because of how it looked but tried it and it's so good"}
{"text":"$0.50 Tacos at Taqueria La Jacky  Video review: https://youtu.be/loqKcDNP4eY Write up & pics: https://www.findingfood.tv/blog/tacos-at-taqueria-la-jacky  Today we visit Taqueria La Jacky in Avondale, Arizona to try their $0.50 steamed tacos. OK, this isn't the first time I have been here. I actually noticed this spot several years ago, but kept passing it up, thinking to myself, \"how good could a $0.50 really be?\" Then one day, after passing this place up for years, I found myself hungry at a weekend street festival. As it turned out, I found myself standing right in front of Taqueria La Jacky and deiced to give it a shot. Not only did I instantly fall in love with their steamed tacos, but I have now been going back to Taqueria La Jacky at least once a month for the past few years. This place is now my go-to spot for tacos.  Taqueria La Jacky is a hidden gem that is popular with locals, but not otherwise well known. My guess is that over time this hot spot is only going to grow in popularity. They have a winning formula, great flavors, awesome price, and a friendly atmosphere. As more people travel out of the metro Phoenix area and into the suburbs, I am sure that Taqueria La Jacky will continue to find a permanent home in many hearts.  There are four different types of steamed tacos offered at Taqueria La Jacky. They have a Rojo Taco (red taco), a Verde Taco (green taco), a Papa Taco (potato taco), and a Frijoles Taco (bean taco). While I love all four of the tacos, my favorite is usually either the Rojo or the Papa, depending on my mood. The tacos come plain with just the filling inside of a small corn tortilla. But there is a small condiment bar with everything you need to top off your steamed tacos.  Taqueria La Jacky is located at 532 E Western Ave, Avondale, AZ 85323. But fair warning, their hours of operation might throw you for a loop, I know it threw me off a few times. They are open 7-days a week from 8AM until 7PM, except Sunday and Wednesday when they close at 2PM."}
{"text":"I've tried the burritos, tortas, tacos, and taquitos here and everything is great. Best bang for your buck - super affordable and authentic."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews I thought this place was going to be good, but after eating here I don't know how they got the reviews they did. I will say it was a clean place. I ordered the flautas and after the first bite I could tell they were frozen. The tacos were very average. I got all 3 salsas from the little bar area as well as limes, cilantro, cabbage, and onions and after eating them I had this taste in my mouth from bad refrigeration. So my opinions is it was not the best."}
{"text":"Decided to give this hole in the wall spot. I imagine these are the best for good tacos in the west valley. The guy who served me was fast and pleasant to make purchase from. I ordered a cabeza and 2 carne asada tacos. The guy same guy I paid to brought my tacos over to me and it was meat and tortilla. There is a salsa/relish bar so you can put as much or few as you want. I enjoyed my meal here. I plan to come back and will suggest to others to give it a shot."}
{"text":"Los empleados estuvieron amigables, el restaurante estuvo limpio, y la comida estuvo deliciosa y económica. Recomiendo la torta, la gordita, y los tacos al vapor. Oh, la salsa verde estuvo rica también."}
{"text":"So I didn't think i was going to like this place at all! I was convinced I was going to get food poisoning, and I couldn't believe that I had let my friend drag me here.. But it was sooo good! I had a Carne asada burrito and it was delicious and yummy! The rice and beans inside were perfect and not overly seasoned.. The only reason I wouldn't rate this sketchy place 5 stars is because, the horchata sucked, it was watered down and tasted very bland. Overall I had a great experience, just skip the crappy horchata."}
