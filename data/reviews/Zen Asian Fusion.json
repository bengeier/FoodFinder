{"text":"First time at Zen Asian Fusion. This place is sweet! And when they say Fusion, they really mean it! Wonderful Asian Fusion AND Spanish whaaaatt?! (That goes for their food options and their music choices, points for ambiance amirite??)  I arrived just a little after they opened around 5:15pm and there were already 5 people there enjoying their food and drinks. I sat at the wonderful indoor/outdoor seating spot and was very promptly waited on. The waitress was fantastic. I was pleasantly overwhelmed with the menu and decided on the Mongolian Noodle dinner. This very tasty dish came with chicken and beef and shrimp which was alive...with FLAVOR! This fresh variety of flavors was so completely welcomed by my taste buds. I will absolutely be back to try all of the other great dishes that they offer.  Atmosphere, great! Service, great! Food, great!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  We eat here pretty much once a week.  We have come to know some of the bartenders quite well.  Jennifer is a sweetheart and an excellent bartender.  Nathan is very friendly and an excellent bartender as well.   We have also gotten to know the owner, Phuong, a little bit.  He is an extremely nice guy, as well. Aside from the fantastic staff the food is excellent!  We normally just stick with the sushi.  The Sole Roll is a must-try.  We eat a lot of sushi and we continually find ourselves going back to Zen.  The fish has always, always, tasted fresh.  I've never had a bad piece of sushi here.  Aside from the sushi we've had the Singapore Noodles and the hibachi.  Both were excellent with nice portion sizes (not too much not too little) and great flavor.  We haven't really tried any of the Spanish dishes so I can't speak to those.  The food is consistently great and comes out quickly.  The ambience is very nice, as well.  Somewhat upscale feeling and great atmosphere/lighting for a date if you sit at one of the tables or outside.  We'll keep coming back to Zen!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and value.  If you like it spicy, try the tilapia & shrimp with green curry.  It is addictive.  Also, the thai shrimp soup is another favorite.  I also go with the Asian side of the fusion but have sampled many of the Spanish dishes and they are also excellent."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places! I love the blue cheese calamari. Where else can you get Asian and Spanish food in one place? I believe the owners use to own Ole Ole which explains the Spanish food, which is amazing."}
{"text":"Zen Asian Fusion never let's me down, especially when I get a spot on the patio. The delicious, fresh hibachi style chicken is my favorite menu item. I also love every sushi roll I've tried there and the edemame is a great app. The only thing is I wish they would bring back 1/2 price sangria on Tuesday nights!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the main East Blvd stretch. The outdoor patio is limited but its all right because the interior is tastefully decorated. Love the food and drink options here! A few suggestions:   - Do the Hibachi over the sushi. The sushi is fine, but the Hibachi is very light and delicious unlike most Asian restaurants.  - Order the Blue Cheese Calamari as an appetizer! SO delicious - The Zen Mojito and the Ly-Chee Martini are great as well.   I live nearby so every time I get lazy about not wanting to drive, I come over here. Which is a good thing!"}
{"text":"After dinner last night, I realized I had been to Zen a dozen times and I felt it was finally time to give Zen some recognition.  It's next to my yoga studio so it's always been a great spot to grab a bite with my friend after class.  There is a reason why it is often described as a little \"neighborhood gem\" -  it's exactly that. You will be greeted with a smile and - speaking from my experiences - the service is always great.    I glimpsed over some other reviews and a lot of people seem really stuck on the concept of having Spanish and Asian on the same menu.  So, for those new to Charlotte, I'll give you a little history on how that came to be. You probably already know that Spanish food is still hard to come by in Charlotte - well, back in the early 2000's the owner of Zen used to have another gem called Solé Spanish Grille (down the street where Kid Cashew just opened), it was sister restaurant to Miró Spanish Grille, which if I'm right is Zagat rated and still thriving in Ballantyne.  At the time having just returned from living in Spain, Solé was one of my absolute favorite spots - especially since nobody else in Charlotte seemed to have an affinity for Spanish cuisine.  I was gutted when I heard they were closing because the building had gotten bought by a new patron.    HOWEVER the result of this was Zen - and as a former patron and fan of Solé, that already set the bar high for me.  Zen gets five stars simply for essentially being a part of our neighborhood for more than a decade - and for continuing to fill that void in our city for Spanish cuisine.  We have to appreciate restaurants for the passion behind them and for what they bring to markets they serve.  A five star review doesn't mean it has to be a five star restaurant.  I have been to Michelin star restaurants, and if you learn anything from that is that they don't follow the rules.  Zen isn't trying to break barriers by putting Asian and Spanish on the same menu - to me, it is a great Spanish restaurant that has reinvented itself to include an Asian fare, a solid choice for good food and an unpretentious dining experience."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had. And I eat a LOT of sushi. The wait staff was extremely friendly and attentive and the ambiance was wonderful. Would definitely continue to go here if I lived here."}
{"text":"I really love when I am able to get over to Zen!!  Was introduced to it by my friend Joe and totally fell in love!!  The Mai Thai's are excellent!  And have always had great service and a wonderful meal!  The owners and staff are so friendly and welcoming.  Great variety of things to choose from!  And definitly try the tres leche cake!!  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Myself and Emma here again on this cold Sunday evening. Zen always serves up great food, reasonable prices and the friendliness of the staff certainly cancels out the cold weather.  Consistently for years now - the management and staff are great....  Mix of Asian and Spanish - plus the sushi - Salmon Nigiri is great !"}
{"text":"I'm surprised with several of the comments here. I live in the neighborhood and have eaten at Zen quite a few times over the last year and a half. The service is excellent as a rule and the staff very pleasant and unpretentious. It's nicely decorated, and except for street noise al fresco and parking lot light glare at night at a few inside tables, the ambiance is both contemporary and comfortable.   Of course the menu selection is varied in this theme and most of the dishes are memorable in taste and beautifully presented. I find the prices reasonable for most selections and the price fair given the food quality, service, and atmosphere. If price is an issue, sign up for their email list when there and you'll get discount offers from them routinely."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself gives a very modern yet sophisticated vibe.  The waiters are welcoming and make you feel at home. The biggest downside is the food itself. I ordered the Mongolian crispy noodle which I believe was $16. The only thing from that dish that was appetizing was the shrimp and if you choose to order this then I suggest you ask for the shrimp sauce which ironically isn't for shrimp but pairs well with it. The crispy noodle really is crispy.. as in raw noodles that look like they just came out a packet of ramen. I went with a few friends so I tried a bite here and there and I can honestly say I didn't like anything. The Sriracha sauce is extremely watered down but is somehow spicier than your average Huy Fong. As for the menu itself, the only 'Spanish' food I saw were the tapas which are appetizers. No quesadillas or the basic nachos like I expected there to be. I never thought I would prefer chinese take out than the food from this restaurant. I'm talking about you China Jade. Thankfully, theres a frozen yogurt place next door so you won't go home regretting so many calories on food that tastes like it came out of a box of lean cuisine."}
{"text":"Very good service.  Our waiter was such a doll.  Nice atmosphere good food.  They seem to really care about their customer's experience.   The prices are great.  I would recommend!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food and service.  My sister and I love this local gem. The staff is friendly and recognizes us. I've gotten take out and eaten at the bar here. It's a quick dinner. A wonderful blend of Asian and Spanish. Mush try the blue cheese calamari and the summer rolls. And I love the spicy tuna nachos (on lettuce cups). Also amazing the parmesan baked scallops. Check out half priced sangria night! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant for a date. Service was good.  Food way over priced for what it was.  The sushi was unimpressive and bland.  I would come back here to have a drink with friends, but not for the food."}
{"text":"This a great spot ! The food is authentic. My favorite is the Vietnamese BUN. However they have many great dishes. The service level is wonderful. Friendly,prompt and respectful , and yet not intrusive. I go there often and strongly recommend it to anyone that likes Asian food. My friends love the Spanish food as well-although I have never tried it."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the waiter Jairo  and  owners are really nice and the atmosphere is perfect. I m not even going to go into details because It would take too long. Its out new favorite restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out this place. Overall the food was very good, I got the green curry with brown rice. We were seated quickly and our waiter was nice. But our food took way longer than it should of we waited well over 30 minutes for just 3 people and the only other customers besides us were seated at the bar....our waiter never stopped by once to see how we were doing once he took our order. When our food finally arrived he apologized and said there were a lot of take out orders.....The curry was pretty spicy and our drinks were only filled up once and after the food was brought he never stopped by until it was time for the check. But overall the food was great even though there was a lack of service."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to this restaurant several times with its unusual mixture of Spanish & Asian dishes.   I always enjoy the Barenjena Rellena (Stuffed Eggplant) especially and any of the several Spanish Tapas available.   Although I don't usually order from the Asian side of the menu, my friends always enjoy those items as well.   To finish off there is always a selection of very tasty desserts."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now. Thier sushi is very good. Service was great. Very friendly at the bar and  makes sure you are satisfied. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Since I've been here only 100 times since I moved to Charlotte 2 years ago, I figured I would give it a review.   This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I have never had a bad experience here. Every time I dine in the wait staff is friendly, helpful and professional. The food is always excellent. I'm usually here for dinner on the weekend, so we usually make a reservation, and we are always seated promptly. The drinks and wine selection is good, but the food is divine. My last visit here was on a Saturday night, and they were packed with 3 parties of 10-20 people so we were informed that they were not offering the sushi menu (its a fairly small restaurant so this was understandable.) but I was disappointed, and my waitress could tell because she went to talk to the chef, who said they would make an exception for us, THANK YOU. Everything on the menu is fabulous, I usually get a specialty roll or the pad thai, but the Sole Roll is my number one favorite on the menu. The blue cheese calamari is also unique, but wonderful. I love to come here with friends or family because i know this place will not disappoint. The owner ALWAYS comes by to make sure everything is okay. This place may go unnoticed if you aren't familiar with it, but you will NOT regret making a trip here!"}
{"text":"I've been to zen several times, usually with a large party, and the service is always wonderful.  The food is mediocre to good, though the highlight of the meal is always their amazing tres leches cake.  They've infused Sole's (RIP) Spanish menu with the Asian offerings, which gives diners a large, if odd, array of dishes to choose from.  I love the Zarzuela de Mariscos  - a seafood melange stewed in a tasty tomato sauce with saffron rice on the side.    Trendy but warm atmosphere.  Servers are always helpful and attentive. Parking is kind of a pain on busy nights."}
{"text":"Lunch and dinner are fabulous here. The service is awesome. The menu has Spanish and Asian features. All are fresh and made to order. The staff will bend over backwards to please you and your tastebuds. Great for date nights, family dinners, and business lunches."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant especially the owners and staff.  They always make you feel welcome.  I come here regularly, and the staff always have my drink ready as soon as I walk in.  The bartenders make efforts to remember customer names and drinks (reg. and new).   The price is just right for the quality of food and consistency.  There are lots regular customers who comes 3 or 4 times a week for years. There is a variety of selections from the menu such as sushi, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese (btw, yummy pho) and Spanish food.  The owner used to own Sole Spanish Grille down the street and decided to combine the two restaurants.  Therefore, you will not be bored with the menu selections and the daily specials Zen has to offer.  I would recommend you close your eyes, point your finger, and order your food.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved the short rib special and the tres leches cake.  The restaurant is really nice inside but service was slow."}
{"text":"We went to Zen Asian Fusion last night for a holiday celebration for one of the boards my husband is on.  It was my first time and we enjoyed it quite a bit.  The party organizers had ordered the food for us, so I didn't get a chance to look at the menu and make my own choice, but they made good choices.  Here are my thoughts:  Ambiance We sat in the outdoor area which was ready for the winter with a nice, very warm heater and plastic around the outside.  I LOVE that, so that was fun.  The staff were also very friendly and attentive, so big thumbs up for that.  Food I started with the Thai soup which was great.  It's exactly the sort of soup I like: lots of yummy broth with good veggies and a little bit of shrimp.  It was nice and spicy, too.  My husband nearly licked his soup bowl, it was so good. For dinner, we had a family style serving of 4 platters:  Chicken basil, paella, sauteed veggies and beef and broccoli.  We also had brown and white rice.  I didn't try the beef and broccoli, but the other table members liked it.  The other dishes were fine, and I added some hot chili sauce to make them a bit more spicy.  Maybe because I am used to Dim Sum (down on Central in Plaza-Midwood), I liked the dishes, but they weren't outstanding.  I didn't eat dessert, but everyone else had the tres leches cake and pretty much scraped their plates clean.  (I take that as a good sign)  Overall, I would go back there for a fun scene and for a variety of foods they offered for picky members.  I do know that the son of one friend of ours went to this place over 200 times in one year!  WOW!!!  That's some loyalty right there, so clearly, this place is a darling of lots of folks!"}
{"text":"The service was exquisite, and the majority of the food clean and lovely. We made a meal out of appetizers and dessert. Appetizers- spring rolls and potatoes in aoili- were very good from presentation to taste. Our dessert, a blackberry cake, though appetizing to the eye, was missing the true blackberry flavor which is naturally tart. And towards the end I tasted more refrigerator than anything else. However the first course and excellent service from our host and waiter will definitely have me giving this place a second try, this time for a main course."}
{"text":"Love the Vietnamese beef!  Interesting menu that combines the favorites from two merged restaurants run by the owner. While Asian fusion and Spanish tapas might not be a conventional medley, somehow it works here."}
{"text":"Overall fair experience. Sushi was great, grilled calamari was bland. We ordered a steak dinner (which we shouldn't have at an Asian fusion place) and it was fair, over cooked and not a lot of flavor. Overall I would come back but I would stick to sushi or pad Thai."}
{"text":"BLAH food and blah service  No sushi during lunch, but it is not that good anyways"}
{"text":"I just don't get this place. Is it because I've lived in Thailand, have travelled throughout Spain and Vietnam, and am obsessed with sushi? Methinks not. I strongly believe that good food is good food, regardless of how authentic it is. Unfortunately, I've been disappointed by Zen time and time again.   Sushi: not fresh Noodle dishes: greasy Tapas: beyond upsetting. How do you mess up patatas bravas? Hibachi: soupy  Service: great, but that doesn't make up for the food  Am I just ordering the wrong things? I live across the street and keep going back in hopes that I'll see what everyone else sees."}
{"text":"First time going here and it is now my favorite new restaurant in Charlotte! We only got to try the Asian side of the place, but it was fantastic. Best Beef with Broccoli I have ever had. My girlfriend even tried the Tataki Tuna because it was that good. Highly recommend, and cannot wait to go back already!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit there, but definitely will not be the last.  We were a group of 4.  The fried calamari was excellent, the aioli sauce outstanding.  We had the gratinadas, paella, zarzuella, and sopa de pollo.  All were perfect. Our waiter, David, kept our water glasses filled and was attentive without being intrusive.  He took care of our special dietary needs easily and pleasantly."}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Service! Nice Find! The spicy Shrimp soup is one of the best soups I have ever had. Everything I get every time I go. We love that place!"}
{"text":"If you want mediocre Asian food with very slow service, then this is the place for you. The restaurant and my glass were in the same boat, almost empty the whole time I was there. There are some great Asian places in Charlotte and I would suggest visiting the other ones before taking a chance on this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Zen, despite a slightly overpriced menu.  We went there on a Friday night after driving around forever trying to decide what we wanted and the wait at the bar was brief.  I had the Zengria and it was super tasty, but at 8 bucks a glass, one would do me.  Since I love tapas and small plates, I ordered all appetizers for my meal and the crispy crab and cream cheese rolls were spectacular!  Obviously cream cheese has nothing to do with Asian cuisine but the added flavor with the real crab meat in a cripsy wonton skin was a perfect match.  I also had the spicy tuna nachos....huge chips covered in chunks of bright pink tuna mixed with a type of spicy aioli.  The sauce was a little much for me, mostly because I'm not a mayonnaise fan and it's resemblance to mayo along with the excessive amount was a bit of a turn-off.  But, the tuna was perfect and the spicyness was just right.  The mussels in ginger broth, however....no, no, no!  Gritty and bland....not worth the price at all.  All in all, I will go back for sure for another glass of Zengria and those rolls alone.  They also have good specials during the week (buy one get one tapas, etc.).  Oh and I sat next to Ric Flair at the bar and being a girl from the Midwest, that was worth the laugh and conversation."}
{"text":"I don't understand the great reviews they have. this place was beyond disappointing.  We tried a sushi roll for our appetizer ( fish is NOT fresh) and had the garlic shrimp from the tapas menu ( All oil and butter and NO flavor what so ever) This shrimp dish was SO bad that I really debated asking for the chef to come out and taste it so I can ask him if he thinks its really okay to serve such bad food. It literally tasted like little shirmps swimming in oil and butter with no flavor of butter nor salt or any flavor at that!! just oily shrimp. gross.  We also had the hibachi ( my husband's favorite food) but the hibachi doesn't even taste like hibachi. So dry and bland.   Everything was SO bad. We will definitely be staying far far away."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Great atmosphere. I ALWAYS get the Langostinos, the sauce is magic and the rice is always perfect. The only thing I haven't enjoyed there was the mint sauce for the steamer. The tres leches cake, bomb! I love this place."}
{"text":"The decor and staff were great. However, the food was okay. Got the green curry chicken. The chicken itself was very rubbery. The sauce was bland. Lots of veggies, but overall not super satisfying. Def not the best green curry chicken I've had, possibly bottom two. Based off other reviews I would probably try it again and get something else."}
{"text":"I finally tried Zen the other night and still struggling with how I feel about it. When I walked through the door, a huge gist of warmth swept over me and felt like I was at home in Florida! Very tropical temperatures in there, I loved it! The service was great, attentive and quick yet the food was kinda meh. I got the garlic eggplant and tofu and was expected it to be popping with of flavor. And flavor it did have-just not garlic flav-wth? It tasted good but just not what I was expecting, The portion sizes were huge though for $10 it was enough for dinner and leftovers for lunch. I really wish their sushi was a little cheaper though, I love sushi but for those prices I just can't swing it and would rather go elsewhere. I can see this as a place I would stop in every few months if that but not a \"Hey, let's go to Zen tonight!\" kinda place."}
{"text":"Spring rolls - very good, but you only get one cut in half  Mai Thai - pretty good,  very sweet Gin a Tonic - Hendrick, excellent  Tuna - My friend said it was awesome! A true 10  Masaman curry (GF) - sautéed potato, onions, green beans, cilantro, basil in a medium spicy light coconut masaman curry sauce (I'm not sure I like this dish anymore) - came out burning my mouth spicy!               *only potatoes and broccoli with the masaman curry. Yum! I'm not a spicy fan, but this is good, I wouldn't even consider it spicy. Try the fettuccini noodles with it instead of rice, for an amazing alternative. So delicious!!    Cauliflower mashed - Incredible!!!  Broccoli in light brown sauce - ask for no sauce under the broccoli. Then it's prefect.   Loved my meal!!"}
{"text":"Zen Fusion, was amazing. Calamari was cooked to perfection (reminded us of Italy). Great service and awesome staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night very casually dressed so we asked to sit on the patio.  Good move.  The patio seems to be the spot for underdressed people with kids.  I asked about the summer rolls on the sushi menu and they sounded intriguing so I decided to order the vegetable summer roll.  Another good decision.  It was made in a soy wrapper rather than a typical rice sushi roll.  It also had so many vegetables packed in.  It was like little bites of summer.  I also ordered the Firecracker roll.  It was yummy.  I have a weakness for tempura fried sushi rolls even though I know I shouldn't eat them.  Still, the balance with the ultra-healthy summer roll make this little bit of a cheat acceptable."}
{"text":"David provided my husband and I with the best service I have ever received in my life. Worth coming just for this attentive service and yum food."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just a bad day for them tonight but I decided to try them for the first time. The bread was like ROCK. The empanadas were good.. The sushi was somewhat fresh but not so much with flavor. My boyfriend's meal was actually great (he had the ahi tuna ) It was an ok food experience but I don't think it is worth $100 bill as our check was..."}
{"text":"Solid sushi spot. I had a spicy salmon roll and a regular salmon roll. Nothing special here though as it relates to sushi. It wasn't bad but not any where close to phenomenal. If you're looking for some decent sushi in a nice ambiance this is a good spot. Service was nice and friendly. I do note they also serve Spanish/Latin fare as well. I'll have to come back and try that."}
{"text":"We were VERY impressed with Zen.  We walked in, gave our reservation name to the hostess, and found out that she already had a table ready and waiting for us!   We were immediately seated with the menus already there for us.  Wow!  We felt so...important.  Is this what it's like to be Brad and Angelina?  We hadn't been to Zen before, but we found the ambiance was even nicer than we were expecting.  It was relaxing, yet fun. The decor was sleek and modern.  And the service was fantastic.  Our very friendly server Fiona did a fantastic job of  making sure we never waited for anything, not that we were in a rush or anything.    I'm not sure what menu some other Yelpers were ordering from, but we found the food very filling, exceptionally tasty, and very reasonably priced.  It's affordable enough to make it a once-a-week place to visit.    There were so many items to choose from on the menu that we didn't know where to begin.  We wanted a sampling of everything.  We started with the Dilworth sushi roll and a Summer Spider Roll.  I've never seen a variety of summer rolls before.  Usually, there's just one on a menu, so it was nice to try something different.  The sushi roll was HUGE for the price.  I'd go back to Zen for the sushi alone.  I also tried the Thai shrimp hot and sour soup...just because.  The flavor was definitely Thai and delicious, but there weren't any shrimp in it, though, so I assumed it was just supposed to have a shrimp base or something.    For entrees, we tried two different Vietnamese dishes:  the Saigon Rice and the Bun (Vietnamese noodle).  They were basically the same with the Bun (pronounced \"boon\") having noodles and the Rice having...well, rice.  The flavor was distinctly Vietnamese and we enjoyed every last bite, especially the grilled seasoned pork and shrimp that were included.  YUM.  They was very tender and flavorful.    For my drink, I had the Sake To Me Martini.  Malibu rum, sake, and juices.  Delicious!  We can't wait to go back to Zen to try many of their other items on their menu.  There's such a variety that you could return time and time again and have a different flavor experience each time.  Great job, Zen!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant about five or six times and every meal has been excellent. Their food (particularly the seafood) is so fresh and has such great flavor. A couple meals that stand out in my mind is the Japanese Teriyaki Scallops - they give you such a great portion of scallops, cooked perfectly and the sauce is the best ever - and the Mongolian Crispy Fried Noodle. I've also had some dishes from the Mexican portion of the menu, but I must say the Asian food is my favorite. The atmosphere is great, perfect for date night. Only complaint is that they do not know how to handle a packed restaurant, and there is barely a waiting area. However, if you make reservations you shouldn't have an issue. The service is wonderful! Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Just forget the Spanish tapas here, they are a huge disappointment. Not at all the sophisticated tiny dishes you expect. Empanadas = Tapas? The Asian food is more interesting but you might be better going to a core ethnic restaurant."}
{"text":"I like Zen they have a great staff and the food is always good! The food is very fresh tasting not over sauced or salted, very clean if that makes any sense!!  I tend to always get the Shrimp or Crab( I forget) Spring rolls along with the Asparagus with with Shrimp in a Brown sauce both are very tasty!! I also have had and like the Hibachi items and the sushi, which by the way the sushi is a big portion!! They run a lot of different Happy Hour Specials throughout the week that includes some food items definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Zen is one of those highly mediocre places that I leave wondering \"Why do I keep coming back here? That was really unsatisfying.\" The last straw was when I got a bento box for lunch (which is a really great deal if the food was more satisfying) and the dessert that came with it was old leftover tres leches cake that was spit-out awful.  (Note: I have had fresh tres leches cake there once that was the only highlight of dinner).  The family who runs it is friendly and they used to own Sole Spanish which was great and I miss the ability to go there now, especially since there's now no Spanish places north of 485 that I know of. But they integrated some of their Sole stuff on the Zen menu, so it's a melange of asian and spanish. That's just bananas. I guess I'm more of a purist - call me a fuddy duddy. If the sign says asian fusion, I want you to do it really really well.  Instead you get either weird or mediocre takes on dishes.   I do like their drink menu and location but I can cook so much better at home, so I'm quitting you, Zen."}
{"text":"I love Zen! I have been going for since maybe 2006. I have had most of the entrees on the menu and they're all amazing! Years ago, the owner closed his Spanish restaurant across the street. Now Zen carries the best of the Spanish dishes they served along with the Asian fusion dishes. I highly recommend the tuna nachos. I also like this restaurant because they donated to a charity event I was organizing years ago."}
{"text":"How have I never heard of this place?  Quality.  They also physically present dessert options to you.  Sales game on point.  That's a pro move."}
{"text":"Having lived in Barcelona, I'm picky when it comes to sangria. But I must say, the sangria at Zen Fusion was delicious. Not overly sweet, with lots of fruit pieces."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner and immediately liked the atmosphere. The menu is very unique so we took our time reviewing it. The waitress was very nice and took her time to go over the menu with us. We both made selections from the Asian side of the menu, and the when he food arrived it looked and smelled great! We are definitely going to go back!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place,  but was  disappointed by imitation crab meat in my sushi roll and spring rolls. For the price, they should use the real thing. I found the calamari a bit rubbery. The sangria was very good."}
{"text":"Can't decide if you want Asian or Mexican? Zen solves your problem by serving the best of both worlds. I've only gotten Asian during my visits (which is always awesome), but I've heard only positive things about their Mexican selection as well. If you're craving Asian, the Sole Roll is a sure crowd pleaser - it's a delicious roll filled with lobster, crab, and avocado topped with crispy onions."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, nice vibe. Both the Asian and Spanish dishes are first rate. I especially like the seafood paella and Vietnamese beef. Tapas are top notch, so is the sushi. I've been here probably 25 times and always had a terrific experience."}
{"text":"First visit was a real delight. Food and service was excellent from drinks to dessert. My wife had the filets de cabrales, the tenderloin with the blue cheese sauce was full of flavor. I enjoyed the pargo de sole. The tres leches was the best I ever tasted. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, great ambiance, however very mediocre food.  Find a chef who knows what real Spanish tapa is please!"}
{"text":"Yum! The fusion idea works here. Not ever fusion concept is a winner but the blending of the noodles and sauces works at Zen.   I've mostly stuck to just two dishes but I've gone with multiple coworkers and everything f looks awesome. The fusion noodles are fun but the pad Thai is always a classic.   The fusion noodles have a really nice curry with them that needs some spice but that's probably a positive for move folks. Ask for the chile oil and they will hook you up for that heat you might want.   The service is good and they do have a covered patio but it can still be hot and can be noisy. This is a fast lunch worth stopping for."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 gold stars!!!! The food is to die for and desserts are so decadent! The service was also great! We are fairly new to Charlotte, and this is our favorite restaurant so far!"}
{"text":"Charming atmosphere...good drinks, great dessert but the middle was totally lacking.  I couldn't even take more than 3 bites of the Montilana beef in sherry wine sauce if that's what you call it. It was god awful. I haven't had a bad meal like that in ages.  The server didn't even bother to ask if I wanted something else. I don't call that good service.  The mexican con leche cake was good, but I won't be jumping up and down to have dinner there again!"}
{"text":"Curry is very dry. ordinary taste"}
{"text":"You must try the Tres Leches cake.  It's not too sweet and just melts in your mouth.  I wasn't too crazy about my entree, but my husband is in love with their Curry."}
{"text":"Yummy!  We had no reservations but only had to wait 10 minutes at peak time on a Saturday night.   The appetizers and drinks were amazing. Cook on the entrees was a bit overdone, but not horribly so. Our waiter David was very attentive and fantastic. I'd love to eat here again."}
{"text":"We've been in Charlotte for over a year now and never heard of Zen Asian Fusion.  We've passed by many times and thought it was just another asian takeout place.  Turns out we got one of the social deals to get $50 worth of food for $25 and decided to go there for an early anniversary dinner.  Granted we were there relatively early (6pm on a Tuesday afternoon) but the service was really great and the food exceeded our expectations.  I got an ahi tuna steak that was very nicely cooked and my husband got a spanish pork dish.  Both were very tasty with good portions.  The best part of the meal though was their in-house tres leches cake.  YOU MUST GET IT!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm really glad to see something so interesting in Dilworth and so close to home. Seriously, all of these killer eateries and shopperies in the Kenilworth shopping center are great. I was really stoked to try out Zen as I've read other reviews from friends and seen their rather interesting menu.   Not sure that I've ever had the fusion of Asian and Spanish Tapas cross my plate ever and I look forward to experiencing it one day. This time around, we went for takeout after being rather tired from moving in and a busy week to top things off. Might of caught these guys on an off night, or it should be enjoyed in-house. Know what I'm sayin?  Here's what we had:   Salmon sashimi -- Perfect. Simple cuts of fresh salmon. Rather thick, too. Always love the different varieties in cuts and this was just fine.   Cali roll -- Standard. I was in the mood for something light and that's what I got. It was pleasant.   Tuna roll -- ??? I've never seen nori that thick, A, and have never seen it laid on the outside of so much rice, B. Also, the nori had a pretty wretched stench. Not sure I've had such a stinky variety before. The tuna was fresh and fine. Should have just picked it out of the middle and went to town!  Summer rolls -- Another ?? They were so weakly wrapped and had pretty nasty tofu as well. Just a huge letdown on flavor and presentation.   Miso -- Just as it should be. I'm a fan.   So, I think we missed the boat here in going for takeout. Next time, I want to check out the tapas"}
{"text":"My parents celebrated their 21st anniversary here with a large group of friends. It was wonderful the staff was so attentive to everyone. My younger sister has a nut allergy and the staff took the time to make sure her food didn't contain any nuts.They even brought out a nice cake for my parents. The manager/owner  introduced himself and wished my parents a happy anniversary. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food was great and dessert was amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place because the wait at another place we love was too long. Turns out they take call aheads and the lady that answered the phone was really helpful by telling us we would only have to wait 15 minutes. Once we arrived the manager greeted us saying the table would be ready in about 5 minutes. He then offered us the bar while waiting and the drink prices were surprisingly reasonable! Aside from drinks, the sushi was delicious, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was cozy!   Definitely making this one of our date night spots from now on.   PS my boyfriend is a calamari guru and he rates this one of the best."}
{"text":"Very good food and very fairly priced.  Menu has a wide selection and service is outstanding.  The location is a little hidden but it is a great spot. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was out for a weekly dinner with my husband who is a vegetarian and It was an impromptu decision to stop by at this place, and we were not disappointed at all. The choices and taste are both good. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I had the California roll which was excellent!!! For the entree I enjoyed the Hibachi Steak with fried rice. And for some reason without them asking how would I like the steak it came out actually tasty. I enjoyed the atmosphere, great for a date or a business meeting."}
{"text":"Took my family for New Years Eve dinner.  As usual. Such prompt services and outstanding quality and flavor of our meals."}
{"text":"This was a horrible horrible place to go. Me and my mom went today for the first and dang sure last. We ask the woman to kiNew explain the menu cause I'm not dumb but it was the set up. She was useless then when we got our food the beef/ steak was horrible and tough and chewy. I ask for no cause and it looked like extra sauce. The owner or manager came and ask us about my food I told her it was all good except the steak an it was horrible. Well she got her parties in a wand and started correcting me calling me names and being down right ugly. For the first time in my life I was completely speechless. So I do not recommend this restaurant at all. I don't even give it a star"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Hands down the best sushi in Charlotte.  The place is nice and the wait staff are very knowledgeable.  I have tried almost every roll and am completely satisfied with every one of them."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Zen for a few years now and although I'm new to Yelp I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it. In my opinion it is as good as it gets and I enjoy dining at Zen at least twice a month.   The staff is amazing and my Lychee Martini is generally on my table for me before I sit down. The servers all work together and there is a great sense of teamwork.   My favorite thing to drink is the Lychee Martini, you must try this!!! Everything I've ever eaten and Zen is amazing. I really enjoyed going to Sole, their other restaurant, before it closed. Since Sole' is closed they have added some of the Spanish specialties to the Zen Asian Fusion menu which makes it true fusion!   All the Asian food is awesome and the Sushi is right there with it! Some of my favorites are: Blue Cheese Calamari Crab and Cream Cheese Spring Rolls Pad Thai Zen Eggplant Red Dragon Roll Bento Box   Ahhh there are too many wonderful things to name on the menu! Do not pass up a chance to dine at Zen. See ya there! :)"}
{"text":"Zen Fusion is the best Blend of contemporary Asian and Latin cuisine. The staff is amazing From being greeted at the front door, to the attentiveness of the wait staff.  Tres Leches Cake is amazing.  I haven't tasted a dish that I did not like there. The service has been great the 3 times we went."}
{"text":"Great date spot! Asian/Italian fusion with our meal consisting of sushi, build your own noodle dish, and Vieiras de Miro (scallop dish).  We were very impressed with everything we ate and cannot wait to go back for round 2!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place cause I hear so much about it. I think the concept is great a mixture of Spanish and Asian food; two flavorful genres of food in one place. Our first visit was really to try the Thai food because it was recommended by a friend. I had to talk myself out of paella which I love to try their Masaman curry with scallops which is a stir fry dish while my bf tried the Thai red curry with chicken. Both of us love spicy food and asked the server if we could turn up the heat on these dishes. Once the food was delivered we got a bowl of their chili pepper oil to top off our plates. I will say even while piling that on top the dish was far from spicy. I tried a little bite of his dish and it was a tad spicier than mine but still nothing spectacular. The environment was really nice and I want to try their outer area one day, the only thing annoying was the buzz from the bar it was entirely too loud to where we could hear an obviously drunk customer discussing his political viewpoints from our table in the back. I think I would give this place a second chance just so I can try the paella but not in a huge rush to do so"}
{"text":"I got the pad thai and it was delicious! The staff was personable, friendly, attentive and accomodating. I love the fushion concept because there were options that would appease anyone. I thouroughly enjoyed every bite and will absolutely be returning!"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing.  I recommend the Zen roll, steak hibachi, potatas bravas, pot stickers, and the tres leches cake.  The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is fun!"}
{"text":"I really do like Zen, but I have to say the best part about it is the staff and the bar. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the food isn't always top notch for me. I have never in all the years I've been going here tried their sushi so I can't comment on it.  However I've had lunch and dinner here many many  times and it's been hit or miss for me. To be fair the misses have usually been at lunch and when I order the more watered down Asian choices that they have! Things I highly recommend are: -Pot Stickers -Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna -Churrasco de Cerde -Kung Pao  These dishes have always been great every time I have had them, those and the Tres Leches... it is to die for!! The staff is fantastic and I love the entire Zen family, and they will remember who you are and take very good care of you.  The bar is extremely well stocked and they have fantastic specialty drink choices and can make anything perfectly!!  They have live music some nights during the week and it's just a great place to unwind after work."}
{"text":"Excellent service, comfortable and casual atmpsphere.  Started off with good fruity red sangria (they need to add a white one).   Ate a seafood in clay pot dish in a light tomato seasoned sauce, all the seafood was properly cooked and very tasty.  Ask to kick up the heat if you like it hotter.   My wife had a seafood pasta dish, seafood all done right and fettuccine al dente.  Didn't stay for dessert,  not particularly excited about the selection.  They need am espresso machine and flan.  Priced right and the portions were good"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. One word: Paella. Actually, two words: AMAZING! Everything was perfect! The atmosphere, the food, the service... everything! We went for our anniversary and couldn't have asked for a better dinner!"}
{"text":"4.75 Stars.....OK, round up to 5!  Wow! WHY the %$!&# haven't I discovered this place before??? Went here with my buddy Paul at his recommendation....needed to chat about life issues so we met at this wonderful place! They have a nice selection so I ordered a bottle of Sonoma Cabernet Sauvignon to start the evening....  Then I decided on their Dragon Roll, which was Shrimp tempura, cucumber, cream cheese, avocado and tuna on top. VERY yummy! I was starving so I followed that up with the Vietnamese Beef, a stir fry concoction of tenderloin, onions, asparagus and lemongrass. VERY tender, flavorful and perfectly seasoned!  The Pièce de résistance was their Tres Leche dessert! OMG! I have had my share of Tres Leche before, but I have to say that this was probably THE BEST I've ever had! Made in house and their signature dessert, my buddy Paul said this is a \"must get\" and I am SOOOOOOOOOOOO glad I listened to him!!! Many Tres Leches that I've had have been dry and uninspired...but this was anything but! Uber moist with subtle flavors of vanilla and natural sweetness of the three milks put into this recipe. This was an AMAZING dessert and a MUST GET when coming here!  Overall I had a fantastic experience here and simply cannot wait to return! HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Sushi and Tapas! Great variety with superb staff and happening bar!"}
{"text":"Came here based on a friends suggestion and I was a little worried because it was a spanish/asian fusion place but trust me it is amazing!!!!   We had the lettuce wraps and they were so tasty. I usually need to add sauces to make it taste great but it didn't need it.   We also had Patatas Bravas and OMG this was the most amazing Patatas Bravas I have ever had. The spicy was had a lot of flavor.   We also had a stuffed eggplant dish and that was also delicious!   The service was great even the manager came by to ask how we were doing."}
{"text":"We were a group of 13, with adults and kids celebrating 4 birthday's for a night out at Zen. We chose Zen because they have the best Red Dragon Sushi Roll and Tres Leches Cake in town. All of the food was amazing and the service was very attentive. Part of our party had been there before but the majority had not. We traveled from South Charlotte (30 minutes) and it was worth the drive. The servers were very friendly and did a great job accommodating our large party. Everyone in our party enjoyed their meal. Zen is a quaint and cozy restaurant tucked away off of East Boulevard serving Spanish food, great tapas and delicious sushi. Great for a date night or a family celebration. Don't miss a chance to enjoy a great meal here."}
{"text":"They are trying to be Soho Fusion in the Heart of Dilworth. It doesn't work for me.  When you see fancy places on the travel channel with a few slices of celery and a meal the size of a ritz cracker... Well, that's called high end fusion.  I'd stay away from this place if you're hungry. If you have the urge to eat like Kate Moss or the one Olsen Twin.  This is your spot and its pricey to boot."}
{"text":"Very few restaurants manage to balance price and quality as well as Zen Fusion.  Very reasonable prices with excellent service and great food.   Try the paella, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere that would be perfect for date night! The patio is a nice intimate set up with great lighting. For the price the food couldn't be any better!"}
{"text":"The Mongolian Fried Crispy Noodles with beef, chicken and shrimp along with Thai Red Curry shrimp was to die for!! A must try. Delicious!!! My man says amazing...."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite asian fusion restaurant outside of San Francisco (and I desperately look for new fusion spots all the time all over the country).    If you are looking for typical uninteresting Asian cooking - you wont find it here!!    I imagine the reason for some of the weak reviews is typical Asian cooking preconceptions or expectations.  Zen is far from typical or even traditional!... In-fact it is downright with the times and has a lot of very unique flavors and textures I have yet to experience anywhere else.    The Mongolian Crispy Noodles is my favorite dish on the menu.  Topping the crispy noodles is a mixture of FRESH, perfectly cooked veggies & meats - but the ingredient that makes this dish sing is the brown sauce that also softens the noodles as you eat.  WOW, this dish is absolutely craveable!   (My mouth is watering just thinking about it!)  The grilled seasoned asian pork is always tender and cooked to perfection.  It is a simple dish served with fresh steamed broccoli, but its perfect texture and unique flavor really make it sing too!  The service is impeccable!  I had only been in there a few times, but the manager somehow remembered my name.  It boggles my mind how he does that - especially since I haven't lived in Charlotte in about a year and he still remembers when I am back in town visiting.   I'm telling ya... If you appreciate unique Asian cooking Zen is worth checking out!  (You may even get a celebrity experience too.  It seems that I always see Rick Flair the wrestler in there at one of the back table.  HAHA!)"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today and were pleasantly surprised. We had eaten at their other restaurant, Miro Spanish Grill, years ago and did not have a good experience. All four of us enjoyed our lunch and we CLEANED OUR PLATES I  had the PAELLA which was full of flavor and loaded with Seafood. The others had HIBACHI CHICKEN, HIBACHI SHRIMP & TERIYAKI SCALLOPS. We were thrilled to find out that Wednesday was 1/2 price SANGRIA...some of the best loaded with Brandy and Rum. The service was EXCELLENT, the food HOT and PLENTIFUL and we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great service!   Tres leches cake, blue cheese calamari appetizer and potstickers were all amazing!"}
{"text":"Picked out random restaurant on a Friday night and decided it give it a try. We were pretty impressed! Incredible ambience, very friendly waitresses, great food and budget price! The menu was short but they covered a variety of cuisines- Thai, Spanish, American and Italian! We tried some Thai and we were satisfied! Only negative I had was the curry dishes (red, green & masamaan) were extremely dry and more like a stir fry! When the bill came up, we were all grinning like 12 year olds at the pleasant realization that great restaurants aren't necessarily expensive!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time for a quick lunch since it's across the street from the office. Staff here is EXCELLENT. They recognize you and are always pleasant, from the hostess to the servers. When I say quick - they are very quick! I usually do the pad thai or the hibachi. I love the vegetables with the hibachi. Also the salad with ginger dressing is very good. I only wish they had sushi on their lunch menu - I'm dying to try their sushi but I'm only in this part of town during the work day!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never written a review about Zen....This is one of my most favorite places to have dinner in Charlotte. One of the things I like most about Zen is the staff and the owners. They always do a fantastic job whether you are sitting at the bar or at table. Zen is one of those places that you can go in for a casual drink at the bar (I recommend a drink called the Blackout but only one not two), bring coworkers for a work dinner, have a meal with your family or a casual outing with friends.   The food is always fantastic, I can't recall a time when I got something that I didn't like. The menu consist of various Asian dishes along with Spanish tapas. They also have sushi and daily specials. I can't even name all of the dishes that I've had, I have probably had 95% of their menu and it has all been excellent. I recommend their blue cheese calamari and a must try is the Tres Leches cake....It is to die for!   They have live music on Wednesdays and various drink specials throughout the week. I particularly love half price bottles of wine on Sundays. If you haven't been to Zen, you're most definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and amazing sushi! Some of the best I've ever had! Give yourself a treat and visit this place"}
{"text":"I went for lunch at about 1pm with a co-worker. No wait time. Waitress and maître kind and prompt.   I ordered the Singapore noodles that featured peppers, chicken and shrimp. Great Meal. My water glass was refilled without asking. The meal was reasonable priced and Great tasting.  Definitely will try a Spanish dish next visit."}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant that serves both Asian and Spanish cuisine and have to say that this place does a very nice job at both. We were able to get both types of appetizers, which complimented each other very nicely. My co workers got Paella and a curry dish while I got a \"Carne Asada.\" I would definitely come back to this restaurant. The service was good, and the atmosphere was very warm and friendly. I would say this is a great place to bring a client, date or a significant other as you can have a conversation without  yelling. I looked at the drink menu and saw they had a significant number of cocktails along with Wine by the glass. This is a definite must return and try some more."}
{"text":"We used our living social coupon for our fist visit to Zen Fusion last night.  The service was wonderful from the moment we stepped inside.  The interior of the restaurant has great ambiance and is quite lovely with lots of little corners for an intimate feel.  But the night was too nice so we decided to wait at the bar for an outside table.  The host found me a chair and pulled it out for me.  The bartenders were both so friendly and did a great job recommending Asian beers. When our table was ready, the host carried my drink out to the table.  Little extras like that are sadly, not common and mean a lot. The waitress was great, the patio very cozy and inviting and our food was terrific.  We got parmesan scallops for an appetizer and went with sushi for our entree.  We eat sushi pretty regular and it did not disappoint.  On top of all of that, the prices are very reasonable.  We had a wonderful experience at Zen Fusion and can't wait to go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is called Zen Fusion! There is no Asian in the name! This is an excellent restaurant, excellent food, something for everyone.  I recommend the Filet de Cabrales, awesome cut of steak with delicious blue cheese sauce and roasted potatoes.   Also the curry is good and this is a good place to get seafood.  Really everything here is good.  I've been eating here for years and never had one bad meal.  Also the staff is really attentive Nd friendly.  Be sure to get the coconut cake too!"}
{"text":"Throwing a bunch of popular food items together from different asian cultures doesn't seem like fusion to me.  Spicy Tuna Nachos was about the only thing I ate there that seemed \"fused\".  They should change their name to \"House of Asia\" it would be more true to what they serve.  Everything is overpriced and the sushi is definetly not worth the price. This place would be really cool if it wasn't trying so hard.  On a good note, the service was fast and friendly.  I just wish the food would have been as good.  This place is Poser Alley."}
{"text":"Okay so my friend and I wanted to go somewhere we hadn't been before so I googled Asian restaurants nearby.   It was a short drive from SouthPark Mall. We got there around 8:45pm. It's a quiet little restaurant decorated beautifully and modern. We were immediately greeted by the host, who suggested patio seating and we happily obliged since it felt amazing out. Nathan, our server, came out as soon as we were settled and said he would return with two waters.   I did not order any tapas but my friend ordered the seaweed salad and ate every bite.   We needed some time to look over the menu since we hadn't been there before. Nathan asked what we liked and have us suggestions. I ordered the Mongolian Fried Noodles and my friend let our server surprise her with her meal.   The food came out surprisingly fast - like seven minutes. The presentation was amazing and the dishes were PHENOMENAL! We had read several reviews recommending the tres leches so, naturally, we ordered one to split. Nathan boxed up our meals (huge portions) and brought us the most delightful cake to grace my taste buds. I kid you not - we ate the cake in two minutes flat.   Long story short, the food and service were amazing & we will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Food at Zen was wonderfully gourmet. I had a restaurant of my own so I'm super picky with my Asian food. The best Asian fusion restaurant I have experienced in Charlotte."}
{"text":"A bunch of us went to Zen Asian Fusion for my friend's birthday earlier this year. The restaurant is very nice and has a cool atmosphere. Unfortunately, none of us were very impressed with our meals, and as a result, the menu seemed pretty overpriced. I might check it out for lunch though, when they've got cheaper lunch specials."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. Nice spot. Convenient to work. Ordered the hibachi chicken. Nothing super spectacular but The tres leches cake on the other hand is uhhhh  to die for! Not too sweet or heavy, just melts in your mouth. Simply perfect. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very very pleasant surprise! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was exceptional. My husband is extremely finicky and is very big on customer service. Both was beyond our expectations. The sushi was OMGGGGG. We are definitely planning another date to come back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. The concept is still odd to me of having Spanish and Asian on the same menu, but saying it's fusion? It seems like two restaurants in one, not really a fusion of the two cuisines. It shows in the staff as well, we asked for wine pairings and the waitress just suggested the one Asian wine on the menu as the best option with our Asian apps? The service was 5 stars otherwise though, our waitress was great. The food was nothing to rave about, but was good and clean, not super oily but not super flavorful either."}
{"text":"I was a bit thrown by the menu at first because I expected Asian and they had a lot of dishes touting Spanish rice. Then I saw it was an Asian, Spanish Fusion. After that all made sense I went for the safety of the Pad Thai because my wallet was clenching and to be to much more adventurous would have exceeded my already stretched budget. Truthfully, I have had much better Pad Thai for half the price. There was zero spice to it and the chicken was rubbery. Pad Thai is not supposed to be a spicy dish but is supposed to be spiced just a tad to provide some nice flavoring. It was noticeably absent. Everyone enjoyed their dish but no one seemed to be blown away. The ambiance of the place was really really nice and would actually make a great date spot. I would not complain if a group I was with chose this as our dinner destination and would probably try to swing for something a bit more risky. But for the price and what I got, I have had much better."}
{"text":"Love , love, love Zen's. This is a place I've been to several times with my family and friends, and we have not been disappointed yet. We typically make reservations if going for dinner , and receive a text confirmation. Inside there is bar and dining room seating, and you can be seated outdoors in all seasons. A great waiter is one who will anticipate the customer needs, give information of specials, and convey authentic courteous service; each time I go Zen's I get this from the staff, so this is why I feel comfortable bringing my family back. Oh the food! Right ! The food is awesome, a Spanish Tapas/Asian menu is what you will find at Zen's , and don't worry there is something for you on that menu. I highly recommend the Sole Roll. This sushi roll includes cooked crabmeat , lobster and avocado. The hibaci is also very delicious, and not greasy at all."}
{"text":"My mom and i went here for dinner on a monday night and were very pleased. we started with the scallops appetizer which i'm sure no desert could beat. the scallops were fresh and the sauce went wonderfully with the bread. i ordered the tuna which was amazing and my mom got the spanish salmon which was \" delicious with the sun dried tomato sauce\" she said it was moist and not dried out. i'm not really a spinach person but hers was fresh( as were my vegetables) and the service was fairly quick-as it was a monday. the food was fairly priced, as it was an upscale restaurant. we did not like where we sat though and seeing as we made a reservation you'd think they could have a better seat then right outside of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Had carryout. But the food was really good! Had been wanting to come here but never got the chance and now that i went im glad i did. been wanting new taste of food for while. The restaurant has a Great Atmosphere Ben though I didn't eat there. Will def be coming back to try something new."}
{"text":"I have eaten here once but been hear about 4 times for their desserts.  they have a tres leche cake that is to DIE FOR!  Yeah it is so yummy ...i dream about it.  As often as i can i return to have a slice of it.  Typically i go with friends and we order a number of desserts to share - not me ...i covetously guard my piece of tres leche and scarf it down quickly so no one else can have any part of it!  I suck - i know ... but when it comes to this cake ...that is just the way it has to be.  The food is good and pretty much anyone can find something they will really like on the menu."}
{"text":"Went to Zen with some friends who had been there before.  Apparently this used to be two restaurants that they combined.  It is interesting as they have Asian and Spanish dishes on the menu (combined the best of both restaurants).    All of the food was very good as I had the paella.  Flavor was outstanding and the portions were tremendous.  I would like to try some of the other options.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Oh Zen.  After walking by this place every day for the last few months, I finally made it in for dinner.  There are a couple of great things that this place has going on:  The decor is pretty cool...modern bar and nice outdoor space. Incredibly friendly staff...always great when everyone you encounter is smiling and nice. Location is convenient...right off East Blvd in a busy part of Dilworth. Diverse menu...Asian and Spanish, which is an odd combo but surprisingly works.  Yet, the food was just ok.  I really didn't love the flavor of my Thai Basil chicken dish.  They could have gone a little heavier on the spices to make it a bit more flavorful.  The mojito I had was also not well balanced and I had about three drinks until I gave up.  The Kung Pow chicken was pretty good though!  Zen, consider this a first date.  I see the potential, so I promise I'll give you another chance and we will meet again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is classy and has a subtle and simple elegance.  Perfect spot for a lunch or dinner discussion.  I appreciate the acoustics as there was never a need to raise my voice to be heard or strain my ears to hear.  Background music was soft and perfect to set the relaxed mood.  As far as the vittles, they could not have been more delightful.  I had the Thai Basil and it exceeded my expectations.  The service was equally as impressive.  I look forward to coming back here for more vittles and more subtle elegance."}
{"text":"So this neighborhood spot tries to be all asian to all people, and it does an OK job on most points.  Will you get gourmet fare here that excites the senses?  No.  But you will get a range of dishes that are executed fairly well and service that is neither too fast nor too slow.  I work in the area, so I end up eating lunch here every few weeks.  While I have my favorite dishes, my co-workers order a fair range of things that are good for comparison sake.  I prefer the green curry dishes, while the hibachi grills seem to be popular amongst my peers.  There is a portion of the menu for Thai and a number of more \"traditional\" (meaning American-ized) chinese dishes (kung-pao, sesame chicken, etc.)  The one thing that I do find disappointing, though, is their sushi.  Very generic maki rolls that lack any adventure or flavor to me (think California Roll).  No sashimi that I have seen.  Besides, Charlotte has much better sushi, even in the same neighborhood, so skip that if you go here.  If you want a little bit of a lot of things, they also have a Bento Box lunch that includes a small salad and dessert.  It's a little pricer, but not bad if you are indecisive.    Appetizers are good here- steamed endamame and seaweed salad are both prepared well and rank as my favorites.    Decor is modern and not overdone, dark woods with a nice bar in the background.    I'd rate this place higher but sadly, there is nothing \"fusion\" about it- no adventure, nothing new happening in the kitchen.  The menu is really a listing of a number of many different dishes, grouped by country of origin, that never intermingle.  You've likely seen and had many of them before.  It's that safety that holds this place back.  Execution of what is there is good, for the most part, but there is a total lack of imagination here that keeps this place from being a destination of choice.  For now, it's a place of convenience."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place doesn't have 5 stars. I love, love, love Chi and his staff!! You will receive top notch service time and time again. The food is always great and fresh! I always take my out of town visitors here and they ALWAYS love it!! I can not say enough good things about Zen!"}
{"text":"Food: Interesting mix of Asian and Spanish-ish dishes. Fantastic vegetarian options for both, we got the stuffed eggplant and it was amazing.  Drinks: Best Sake I've ever had. Good wine selections, way more bottles than glasses, well-priced mixed drinks, limited beer.  Service: excellent.  Atmosphere: decor and lighting are romantic, tables are really close together though.  Overall: I would return, especially for specials like half off appetizers from 4-6:30"}
{"text":"The service is attentive... a VERY good thing these days but there's a strong initial push for an \"adult drink\" order. I know this is a great profit area for a restaurant but they need to chill on how they ask. But, in all fairness, after I did order a beer (see, it works!), it was no problem getting water...  The almond encrusted tuna was just OK... it almost seemed to be mass produced because it had little flavor. However, the surrounding vegetables were outstanding. I'd give the food just 3 stars.  The interior is comfortable... not too loud or dinghy... it is well adorned sans anything garish.   Will I come back? Yes... the prices are VERY reasonable, the service is great and I won't judge the entire menu on one order... more follow-up reviews to come."}
{"text":"Great food. We got the miso soup, Bruce Lee Roll, Spider Roll, and Firecracker roll. Our favorite was by far the firecracker though they were all delicious.   service was great too.   Only wish was to have green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food, great flavors! Call ahead to reserve your seats, especially on busy nights, you will be glad you did! Free parking in the parking lot of the complex. Handicapped parking nearby and accessible entrance and seating. Great service, good food options! Overall great experience! Good for big group or date night. Please note, some dinner foods are spicy so if you like that its great!. I had to spicy dishes, and both were great. Thai shrimp soup and fusion pasta. The fried calamari appetizer was nice and crunchy, just how I like it and the sake was good as well. Loved it! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with my date and had a great time! Never been there before, I only knew of it due to the Entertainment Book!  Our waiter was a very attentive gentleman, who got our waters quickly (and always kept them filled!). We sat near the bar at a high table against the wall and had a great view of the 2 acoustic guitar players/singers that were performing! The place was pretty crowded but not loud and the lighting made for a great date atmosphere.  Weird side note - this place is half Spanish, half Asian. I am not sure I would ever order the Spanish side of the menu though the dishes look interesting enough.  We ordered 2 tofu rolls (not sushi, think raw egg roll but healthier!) and they came out really quickly with a think peanut sauce. I didn't care for it so I asked for some duck sauce - what he brought me was amazing! A thai spicy chile duck sauce he called it and it was perfect!  I ordered the hibachi shrimp and chicken w/ brown rice and my date ordered the teriakyi chicken w/ brown rice and both were great. I'll admit that my portion was significantly smaller than his which was odd, but it tastes amazing! Both the teriakyi sauce on his and shrimp sauce with mine were great and we cleaned our plates!  We opted to not go for dessert, but that dulce de leche cheesecake looked great.... Sad they don't have any beer on tap, just bottles.  We'll go back!"}
{"text":"My only disappointment is that I didn't discover this place sooner.  I had the hibachi, and the GF had a curry dish.  Both were excellent.  David did a great job taking care of us, and made some recommendations for drinks as well as the food.  Definitely will be back soon and often."}
{"text":"First time here but definitely won't be our last!  Started with a wonderful greeting by Phong (owner later learned) and being seated in David's section.  We lucked out because I can't imagine another server being as attentive and nice!  Usually the service is great and the food is lacking but in this case both were amazing!  All of David's recommendations were incredible!  We started with the red dragon roll and sushi nachos followed by the sea bass and my husband had the beef tenderloin.  All excellent recommendations!  Oh wait...we weren't done yet, had an awesome coconut vanilla cake for dessert!  Once we lose the 10 lbs we gained, we will be back!  Rates in our top 5 Charlotte restaurants!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and loved it both times. Our waiter Jairo served us both times. He was very attentive, took special requests when necessary, and overall made the dinner very enjoyable.  The outdoor section is my preference. We tried the grilled calamari, which was tasty and not overcooked. I also had the sauteed mussels (part of the Spanish tapas), and loved it. My girlfriend had the salmon and it was cooked perfectly, with a great sauce.  My only criticism would be the men's bathroom. For the quality of the restauarant and food, the bathroom could be a little cleaner with nicer fixtures."}
{"text":"It's called Asian fusion for a reason. Their take on Asian cuisine will make you dream of your next visit. My absolute favorite is their Paid Thai which I switch up from time to time by changing the meat it comes with. You can't go wrong whether you choose scallops, beef or chicken. Definitely add on the hot and sour shrimp soup or a side salad with ginger dressing. I have a difficult time choosing between the two."}
{"text":"Excellent place! Definitely a great date place, I took my two toddlers and my infant and rolled the dice. They were quite accommodating and provided flawless service. Good kids menu with good portions. The eclectic menu featuring both Asian and Spanish tapas sounds strange if you haven't gotten on board the trend, but this place should last long past the trend. Traditional Chinese meals-like Sesame Chicken-and Vietnamese-like Bun-are available if you want a standard dinner experience and the Sesame is quite good! Tender and well flavored, it is a bit bland but still satisfying. The tapas sounded good The empanadas were fantastic and the parmesan-crusted scallops in a marinara topped with cheese was flavorful and almost could've been a meal in it of itself. Even the rolls were good! My wife had the sushi-Miko roll-and it was fresh and not fishy. Excellent!The sashimi was good, not great. They have an extensive wine and drink menu, the atmosphere is nice and clean without being over-the-top. You can dress up or go casual and you won't feel out of place. I think I found a new Queen City favorite!"}
{"text":"Zen is a good place to go when you want a mix of Asian dish options. You can get a mix of Chinese, thai, and Vietnamese dishes there. The Mongolian Crispy Noodles dish is meaty and yet soothing. It has a very good taste! The servers are attentive to your needs and very friendly. The ambiance is a great for a nice dinner for two or a pre night out on the town meal with friends."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience, especially on a busy Saturday night! Every moment of our meal was enjoyable. Despite it being a busy Saturday night - and by busy, I mean packed - we were seated immediately and the service was perfect. The dim-lighting and overall ambiance was the cherry on top.  Our server, Jairo, was attentive, helpful, and genuinely friendly. He checked on us frequently and the manager who greeted us also stopped by our table to check on our food.   And of course, the food! We ordered two appetizers as well as Sake, and two entrees. Flavorful, impeccably fresh, not overbearing and certainly not lacking. I had a tofu stir-fry dish and my date had a seafood noodle entree.   Do not judge this book by its cover! The outside truly doesn't do it justice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! Great choice in appetizers, sushi and entrees. My only complaint is that I usually dine with my sister who has celiacs. On our first visit, the waiter was very helpful and attentive with her dietary restrictions. The following visits, she has notified the waiter but has gotten sick from cross contamination. I would appreciate if they were a little more careful in food prep with her allergy! Otherwise, their tres leeches cake is amazing and I love trying all the different appetizers. Some of the best sushi rolls in Charlotte and on Friday they are 1/2 off before 6:30. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Ambiance, service and food. All amazing. What a great place for dates and families. They have TVs if you just want to casually watch a game and hang out at the bar as well. Plenty of parking and they take reservations! The outdoor patio is so cute and has heated fire lamps so even wonderful to sit out in the cold months.   Now the food. What a great concept and executed beautifully. The Asian and Spanish twists were delish. So many vegetarian options it was hard to choose. We got The Pequillo peppers, edamame, fried eggplant, patatas bravas, zen fusion noodles with massaman curry and stuffed eggplant with Spanish rice. It was all such a great blend of flavors and yummy. The Spanish rice could've used more flavor/zing. I would highly recommend Zen!!"}
{"text":"Zen is my family's Cheers, everybody knows your name. If you haven't been, do yourself a favor and go. Zen is one of the best dining experiences you will have in Charlotte. Great food, great service - live music on Wednesdays.  We first started dining with Sole in 2001 it was always a fantastic Spanish and tapas restaurant. In 2010, when it consolidated into Zen (joining Spanish and Asian in one location which is a much longer story) the owners Phong and Jenny created one of the most unique menus I have ever seen. You can eat here every week and never get bored because ALL the food is exceptional.  The only thing better than the food at Zen is the service. The staff has extremely low turnover which tells you it's a tight knit family and they all work together to provide the BEST dining experience (and they remember you when you come back the next time)  Honestly, I love great food and great service and I would totally recommend going to Zen."}
{"text":"No more sushi?!?! Shocked to learn this the last time we came in. We were regulars, however will likely not return as the sushi is really what made this spot stand apart as a staple for our family and friends. They no longer have \"something for everyone\". We have tried their other dishes before, and they are great, however, I can't see myself dining here on weekly basis to order heavy noodle dishes, blue cheese calamari, and the likes. This just doesn't fit our lifestyle. We will miss you, Zen, and will return when the sushi does!"}
{"text":"I was craving Thai and remembered Zen serves Thai.  Many people judge a thai restaurant by the Pad Thai.  I am not a big Pad Thai fan so I judge them by Thai Basil Chicken.  So that's what I ordered here.  I also ordered it extra spicy.  What arrived was a plate of rice and my thai basil chicken in a thick brown sauce which made it look more like a chinese dish than a thai dish.  And extra spicy it was not.  Actually, maybe extra mild, if there is such a thing in thai cooking.  I asked for more spice and they brought out a small dish of it but even that didn't do anything.  It took me 2/3 of the dish to reach a normal level 3.  And that was about the only flavor I tasted.    The brown rice wasn't even that good and I was adding more spice to it to make it bearable.  The meal also came with a spring roll whose only flavor was the grease it was cooked in.  There are so many other places in Charlotte to get good Thai food.  This was more like Chinese and I really don't care for Chinese food.  Nothing here stood out as far as flavors.  Pity."}
{"text":"Best potstickers I've ever had!! And the Sushi was amazing as well.  I honestly didn't know what to expect from this place but I was so pleasantly surprised by everything. The service, food, and ambiance was wonderful. The Zen Roll, Pork Potstickers, and Miso Soup were all delicious!"}
{"text":"Party of 3 on a Thursday night.  We decided to share the Tapas as dinner and we were all pleased with the food.  Two of us opted for Chardonnay to start and it was good.  $13/glass is not what I like to pay but it was good and other places charge more.  We started with the Asian Potstickers and Empanadas.  Both came to the table very quickly, were hot, fresh, and flavorful.  Next we had Blue Cheese Fried Calamari, which was probably the biggest hit. The Patatas Bravas (roasted potatoes in a mildly spicy ailioli sauce) was too spicy for me, but many things are.  My 2 dinner companions really liked them,  Finally, the Piquillo (roasted peppers with spinach and goat cheese) was tasty and came with warm rolls for dipping.  It wasn't what we expected because it was the consistency of spaghetti sauce with a little spinach rather than chunks of red peppers, but I can't complain about the dish otherwise. With the bread, it was the most filling.  I would return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I love the variety of food they offer, especially the Spanish plates. I usually only for the stuffed eggplant, and always have enough left over to take home. The sangria is a great choice, and also be sure to save room for the Tres Leches for dessert...I will go so far to say it's divine (and I'm not a huge dessert person)! My only complaint is some of their dishes labeled \"vegetarian\" do have fish sauce as an ingredient and it's not an option to leave this out. Will for sure go back to this quaint, Dilworth spot."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio and enjoyed the intimate environment for my wife's birthday. The sushi is some of the best I've ever had. Sangria was refreshing. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place has been one of my favorite take-out spots for years so it's definitely time I showed some love :)   Full disclosure: I've never tried anything Spanish except the patatas bravas (which were awesome hangover helpers), but I love EVERYTHING on their Asian fusion menu from the wok to the sushi.   Hot and sour soup or edamame is good to start, then they have a great selection of rolls. I personally love the ones wrapped with cucumber! Kung pao tofu, chicken, or shrimp is always delicious as well. Everyone in my family loves this place, and have never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"Honestly very disappointed. Ordered pad Thai and a sole roll. Waiter was rude and unpleasant. Took almost an hour for our food to be delivered to the table. Pad Thai smelled like a dirty subway station and tasted bland. The vegetables seemed soggy and almost to the point of being rotten. Sushi roll was very cheaply presented and portion size was something they should have been embarrassed to serve. They were aware of our tables dissatisfaction and offered our large party on the house desserts and each a 10 dollar gift certificate. Nice of them to do- but I would NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"After snagging a great deal ($25 for $50 worth of food and alcohol) from Travelzoo we decided to check out Zen for dinner.  They run specials nearly every day of the week. On Wednesdays they have live music and half off sangria ($3) so those were nice little added perks. The musician was really good without being disruptive, and the sangria wasn't overly sweet!   After reading a recommendation from Yelp we tried the blue-cheese calamari. They aren't overly blue-cheesy, and while being decent I would try the tuna appetizer next time.   For my entree I went with two specialty rolls. I ordered the Red Dragon and the Fresh Cucumber rolls. I always ask for whole pieces of tuna rather than chopped (a texture thing), and thankfully they were able to accomodate no problem. I absolutely loved the Red Dragon roll and would get that again next time.   My husband had Pad Thai, my sister-in-law had Chicken Hibachi, and my brother in law had Sushi as well. Everyone was happy with their meals.   The desserts looked awesome but we were way too stuffed to eat anything else..next time!  Our server (I cannot recall his name off-hand, Dave?), was extremely nice and was super patient when half of our party was running a little late. He made great suggestions and was just overall completely on-the-ball.   I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We used to do team events here a lot. One time, there was a lobster and shrimp special that I absolutely loved! Alas, I was unable to have the chef recreate the dish the few other times I came after.   Casual dining, enjoyable Asian food. We almost always blow our budget by having tons of patron ;p"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here for dinner last night because I had a Chinese food craving and thought it would be good to try something new. Honestly, I wasn't impressed at all. Forget hitting the spot, the food here didn't even get anywhere near the spot. Firstly, the place is pretty small and has a rather weird layout. We were seated at a table near the bar and man, did the sound of the bartender shaking up drinks get annoying! It was so loud that I had trouble hearing my boyfriend a couple times. No sooner were we seated than the waitress asked us if we wanted to start off with any appetizers. I mean, at least give us a chance to look at the menu! Other than that, she was very attentive and courteous so I'll give them points for service.  We ordered the steamed pork pot stickers, which were pretty decent. For entrees, I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and my boyfriend had the Mongolian Crispy Fried Noodles. The Kung Pao chicken was disgusting. Firstly, it was not spicy at all, even though it's marked as spicy on their menu. The chicken wasn't marinated and tasted like boiled chicken covered with sauce. The Mongolian Crispy Fried Noodles were much better, although nothing really worth writing home about. I'm never going back. I'd much rather eat at places that focus one thing and master it rather than being a Jack of all trades and trying their hand at everything from Chinese and Thai to Spanish and Tapas."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here it was my friends birthday an she is vegan an they fix food to her needs.  Ordered edamame to hold me until everyone ordered yum.  My friend ordered the mushrooms of which they normally use butter but used olive oil for her.  I ordered the Shrimp fettuccini with tomato sauce. The shrimp huge prawns an so much food , shrimp was cooked perfectly.   I cant wait to go back the staff was great you have so many different choices a place you dont wanna skip."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you.  Yes there's sushi and Asian food but they are not \"fused\" together with the Spanish fare and tapas.  Surprisingly, they have distinct dishes from Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, all the way to Spanish specialties.  Once we entered during the early bird dinner time, we were quickly greeted and easily seated.  The decor was nice and probably would have been more romantic atmosphere if the sun wasn't shining outside.  However they do have an outdoor patio that I'll have to try next time.  Onto the food (no tapas for our appetite): my wife and I tried the Churrasco de Cerdo, Sesame crusted ahi tuna, a Miro roll, and the tres leches cake for dessert.  Everything was delicious!  A little pricey but a social deal of $25 for 50 allowed us the courage to try the pricier dishes.  The pork was flattened but nicely seasoned with rice and beans. Ask for their hot sauce to add even more flavors. And no, I'm not referring to Texas Pete or Tabasco.  The ahi tuna was a larger portion than the norm, so at $18 I was content.  As for the desserts, they house make the tres leches cake while the others are sourced from a bakery.  So I'd suggest their tres leche cake, light and tasty and not too rich.  They have daily drink specials, mostly discounted wines by the glass or half price bottles.  The surrounding Dilworth location can get cramped.  Fortunately there is a parking lot accessible beside the Harris Teeter shopping plaza behind the Dilworth Coffee."}
{"text":"I'm very sad to say that they stopped serving sushi about 6 months ago....that is such a shame because it was one of my favorite sushi spots...I am really gonna miss the \"sole\" roll"}
{"text":"While the idea of Spanish and Asian fusion doesn't sound appealing, Zen Fusion is simply outstanding at creating both cuisines.   Everyone in my party really enjoyed their food. Everything from their noodle stir fries to their paella was quite delicious! I was very impressed with the price point as well - you don't have to wait for a special occasion to get high quality cuisine here.  I had such a difficult time selecting off the menu, but I'm sure I will be back to sample more Spanish dishes, sushi, and tapas!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious. Probably best basil chicken and spring rolls I ever had in charlotte area"}
{"text":"I have been here several times now and while the food has been consistently good, the service has not. I've tried a variety of food such as the salmon, hibachi shrimp, and mixed vegetables and all have been good. However, every time I've eaten in the actual restaurant, the service has been subpar. I have usually been greeted nicely at the door but after that it just goes downhill with individual servers. I don't think any of the servers are actually rude, I just think they get busy. I will likely continue to eat here but it will probably be on a takeout only basis."}
{"text":"We eat at a different restaurant in the Charlotte area every Saturday with friends. But on Friday nights, we keep going back to Zen Asian Fusion. The food, atmosphere and service are exceptional. The Tre Ci Luce Cake is my favorite desert."}
{"text":"Wow! How did I not find out about this place sooner. I came here last night with my boss we had a couple small dishes including the Tuna Nachos (so yummy) and Blue Cheese Calamari, which is to dieeeeee for.  We also go the Pad Thai, which I can't say was great, but it wasn't bad.  The two earlier dishes though, were so delicious!  We also got their sangria which was on special and that was pretty good in addition. There was indoor seating as well as it appeared to be a half covered outdoor patio, although we didn't go out there.  I will definitely be returning and it wont be too long before I do! :)"}
{"text":"I still don't get the concept. I usually am about picking one thing and doing it well. We leaned toward the Asian dishes as they looked more appealing. Got the firecracker roll and I thought it was okay, but too reliant on sauce for taste- I actually like the taste of raw fish and this was American ized a bit too much for my tastes.  The mussels were okay. In a spicy ' ish tomato based sauce. Again, I wanted to taste the mussels themselves more. But, they were good sized and cooked well. They were served with soft rolls. I think something along the line of a crisp or crunchy bread would have been a better texture combo.  However I can honestly say I Loved the sashimi carpaccio. We got tuna, and it was delicious. Would strongly recommend. Our server Hiram was efficient but not intrusive. Parking was a breeze even at 730 on Friday.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, wonderful service and a great price.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Asian and Spanish food.  I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Today's meal was really gross but I was at a work lunch so had to choke it down. I am really not sure what was going on with the chicken...the texture was gooey and not like any chicken I have ever tasted. The service was also very slow and it was not that crowded. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before the Katt Williams's comedy show. Ordered the Thai Basil Veggie stir fry. Nice atmosphere, server was quick and attentive. The food was good, fresh and flavorful. Good spot to try if your new to Charlotte like me and need to find your go to spots! Looks like people enjoyed the wine and bar as well."}
{"text":"I've been a customer for a long time at Zen for several reasons their quality of food, their excellent service and cozy atmosphere. Zen is located in one of Charlotte's nicest neighborhood so if you're looking for cheap Asian food- this isn't the place to go to. if you're looking for fresh ingredients and great service as an added bonus to make your dining experience more enjoyable go to Zen. It's worth it!  Try the Zen ginger martini."}
{"text":"We went to Zen today for lunch. It is an interesting concept because it menu provides an option of Asian inspired dishes as well as Spanish inspired dishes. The table went for Asian, except for one friend, who went with a Spanish inspired salad.  We had a group of 7 and needed to be seated quickly because we have exactly 1 hour for lunch. I called ahead to make a reservation which was a really easy process and our table was ready for us when we arrived.  Our server was friendly and attentive. My water glass was always full which was a plus!  I enjoyed my lunch (Kung Pow Chicken) but it was not the best I've ever had. It said on the menu it was supposed to be spicy, but I had to ask for a side of chili oil and siracha to make it spicy to my taste (it was rather mild). It was a large portion, so I will have leftovers for dinner! The amount of veggies was great. I am only giving two stars because while the service was good and the food was fine, I have had much better Chinese food and I prefer other Asian places in Charlotte (SoHo Bistro, KO Sushi). And minus one start because no sushi menu for lunch!  Solid-ish place, good service, ok food. I was content with my meal. I would go back, maybe at dinner so I could try the sushi. I am still confused by the Asian/Spanish theme."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I enjoy the lo mein noodles.  They are always fresh and delish. The service is hit or miss.  The environment is very nice, hip, cool.  Speaking of cool, take a sweater because it's always chilly! Prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Given other reviews I was not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I had the sesame crusted ahi tuna which was excellent. Companions had the zarzuela and Singapore noodles which they both enjoyed (plates left clean!). Service was attentive and we all enjoyed the sangria special and live music (Wednesdays only). Only negative was the Tres leches cake- I was really looking forward to this as it's made in house but found the cake to be dry when it should have been moist and soaked in the condensed milk. Others found it too sweet overall.   In any case, I would come here again."}
{"text":"Went to Zen Asian Fusion for Valentine's Day with a reservation. Arrived early, sat at the bar and had a glass of sangria and blue cheese calamari. Both were delicious and the sangria was a great price ($6). Once we sat our table, we had the potstickers (lovely) and the Mongolian stir fry but subbed the crispy noodles. Everything was very tasty!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit to Zen. The service was friendly and very helpful. The atmosphere was nice, as well. We had a Zen Mojito and Zen 88, both were very good.  For appetizers we had the empanadas and the gazpacho. Also, I believe that the gazpacho has cream in it. Both were fair and both needed a kick of flavor, maybe some jalapenos.  For our entrees we ordered the Green Curry with Chicken and the Paella Valenciana. The Green Curry was exceptional. It was just the right amount of spice and the chicken was sliced thinly and cooked perfectly. It was a large portion.  The Paella Valenciana was authentic with shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, and fish. The tomato sauce was good. While, traditional Paella isn't necessarily spicy it would have been nice if it would have had a bit of spice to it. I had to add pepper. But still it was overall very good. All of the seafood was very well cooked. The portion wasn't huge but it was enough after having a drink and an appetizer.  For dessert we shared the pineapple upside down cake and WOW! It was definitely the highlight of the meal! The cake was very moist and it had a strip of cheesecake in the middle! Very tasty!  Overall, our experience was very nice and we would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Friendly service; they seem to know everybody by name, and treat me like a regular -- or even their only -- customer, even though I only make it there every few months. Fantastic value. Great, intimate atmosphere. I have never been disappointed in any dish, and I have tried many of them over the years. Don't miss the tres leches cake!  Genuine hospitality and kindness goes a long way, and that's what you get at Zen, along with delicious food."}
{"text":"Love Zen! The food, staff and people that always support are fantastic.... if you haven't been to Zen yet- please put on your list!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the service is spectacular! The calamari is soooooo good and the tres leches is Devine. The coconut cake is out of this world"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Asian Fusion cuisine but sadly, my experience at Zen was less than stellar.  A girlfriend and I met there at noon on a random Wednesday for lunch.  She ordered Sesame Chicken and I ordered Hibachi Chicken.  We both had salads (which were very watery)--actually, she didn't order a salad but they mistakenly brought one out for her.  After waiting over 45 minutes for our food, we asked the waiter how much longer we should expect to wait (after all, we both had post-lunch clients that would be waiting!).  Our food eventually came out and it was delicious!  I was not disappointed in either of our entrees but was rather annoyed at the amount of time it took to get it.  50% of our bill was removed for our inconvenience.  While that was a nice gesture, I'm not sure I'll make plans to go back anytime soon.  Customer service, especially on the first visit, is critical...sadly, Zen fell short."}
{"text":"We waited an hour for a table, so my expectations were high (long wait should equal excellent food, right?). The food was mediocre, and that is me being generous with the rating. I ordered the Thai Green Curry....meh. There was very little gravy; the veg was under cooked; portion of rice didnt match the portion of veg. Lychee martini had canned lychee in the cocktail...I prefer fresh."}
{"text":"First time visit and the food was amazing. We got black bean soup and lettuce wraps to start, both excellent. I had the chimi pork with black beans and plantains which was amazing and BF got the Chicken Pad Thai which was the BEST Ive tried in Charlotte. For dessert tres leches which was served on a cold plate with cold forks... this place definately pays attention to detail. Very warm cozy and friends, service was great... seemed like a place where everybody knew everybody and it they had a lot of regulars"}
{"text":"I love going to Zen, the owners and staff just make you feel very welcome. It's no surprise then that place has many regulars. I will be one. We did a tapas style dinner, our waiter, David, was genuinely helpful."}
{"text":"Service is fantastic, and the food is very good! Highly recommend the pot stickers, empanadas, and spicy tuna  nachos!"}
{"text":"It was decent. I loved my dish but some of my friends didn't like theirs.   I had the sesame crusted ahi tuna and it was really good. The tuna was just right and the sauce was fantastic. However, I tried some kind of spanish Chicken dish and the chicken was super dry. They had to return it and order something else. They got the seabass instead cooked with a light ginger soy sauce. It was cooked just right and the taste was really good. I just think everything is a bit overpriced for the quality of food.   I do have to say I like the atmosphere of the restaurant. It's very intimate and classy, a good place for a date night.   So if you decide to go here, my advice is to stay away from the chicken and order seafood!"}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with this cute spot in the heart of Dilworth.   Today was my second time visiting. You're greeted very warmly at the door. We sat in a high-back booth that provided ample privacy in this intimate space.   Today, I tried the soup over the salad. I'm not a big tofu fan, but the tiny chunks in the soup were actually a nice added touch with the greens. I'm a creature of habit and will get hibachi shrimp whenever and wherever I can. Theirs will not disappoint you. The lunch portion is significantly smaller than the dinner portion but the price reduction reflects it. Eight or so rather large shrimp come with the meal. I LOVE their fried rice so I doubled that in lieu of vegetables. Drowned in shrimp sauce, the hibachi shrimp and rice hit the spot!  I will definitely go back and eat inside for dinner; I did dinner carry out last week. They serve wine and spirits and have outdoor seating which would make for a lovely outing."}
{"text":"Zen is definitely more then Asian Fusian, offering Asian, Spanish and even sushi.  Zen is located in a small shopping center off of East Blvd and could be the hidden gem only known to locals in the area.  I have ordered pick up and enjoyed everything and this past visit I was craving sushi and decided to take a seat at the bar and enjoy some good food. Upon arrival I was surprised to see the place was packed on a weeknight, with a 20 minute wait. The host was extremely friendly and that service only continued at the bar. I ordered a martini, half price the night I was there and started with the miso soup and pork dumplings, fried. The soup was good, but the dumplings could have been some of the best I have ever had.  Sometimes dumplings can lack filling and flavor, these did not. They were stuffed with an amazing pork mixture that was flavorful and only better once dipped in their ponzu sauce.  After enjoy the appetizers I decided on one roll, the Red Dragon. Let me tell you this is an enormous roll, and delicious.  Shrimp tempura, cream cheese and cucumber topped with spicy tuna.  Even though I loved it I could not finish it, I guess I enjoyed the dumplings too much. However, I definitely look forward to my next visit and cannot wait to try more items off this spectacular menu."}
{"text":"Interesting blend of Asian and Spanish Tapas. Very attentive service and quick on a weekday lunch at least. Great Thai soup and nicely cooked fish entrees. I do wish they offered sushi at lunch, presentation for entrees was a bit to be desired but overall I'd come again."}
{"text":"I like their lunch menu.  I also like the fact that they have green tea.  I had red curry, beef with jasmine rice previously.  Their pork egg rolls are also very unique. Most similar restaurants offer veggie/shrimp/spring rolls and do not put much meat into their rolls.  Zen Asian Fusion offers good customer services.  Their servers nonetheless need to smile more but I appreciate their regular check ups on their customers.  I also enjoyed the lighting and the overall peaceful ambience.  I will return to experience other of their dishes and report back. :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a happy medium. And that's okay.  For dinner, the Mr. wanted sushi, and I'm easy to please, so I went with the veggie green curry. Top that off with tofu summer rolls and a miso soup, our takeout order was complete. We went to pick it up, and it was ready at the appointed time.  As for the curry, it was just fine. Nothing outstanding, full of vegetables and served with brown rice. I enjoyed the flavor, but kept encountering strings of some unidentifiable green stalk in my bowl. Not the most appetizing discovery.  Summer rolls were not the best. But they did in a pinch. The peanut sauce they were served with didn't deliver anything spectacular.  The Mr. reported that the sushi was actually pretty terrible, and sitting next to him, it smelled pretty terrible, too.  Not sure about the dine-in experience, but hopefully it's better than the takeout situation."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! My friend and I happened to decide to come here on a Saturday for dinner during happy hour (5-6:30 on Friday and Saturday). We each ordered an appetizer and a sushi roll to share (4 plates total) and our bill combined was $27. What?! A total steal! They refilled our waters every time we took a couple of sips, the waitress was very sweet, and the owner checked up on all the tables to make sure everyone was happy.  We ordered: - steamed potstickers (I think there were 6 of them for $4, great!) - muscles (I don't remember the actual name of the tapas, but the sauce was amazing!!) - firecracker roll (my least fave out of the four but still good) - Bruce Lee roll - Get it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere and good food.  I have sat down at the bar for some sushi and wine, as well as enjoyed dinner in the dining area.  All of the food (I only had Asian food) was high quality, and the service was good.  There was nothing that really stood out about this place, though, that makes me want to come back consistently.  The place is not extremely pricey, but it isn't cheap.  I think it's the overall value that made me feel unexcited about this restaurant that was a decent place."}
{"text":"Mediocre Americanized Asian food. Tried bunch of dishes. None of them was good. Great ambiance, but that's about it. At least not for me..."}
{"text":"Have been there several times, always enjoy the food.  Everyone I come in contact with has been very nice and accommodating.  I tried the shasimi last night, tuna and salmon. Interesting twist with the jalapeno.  My friend tried the cream sauce, it was ok."}
{"text":"A delightful surprise as we were forced to select a different restaurant from another having a long wait. Asian was not even on my radar, but we decided to give it a try. Everything was amazing! Our server was quite attentive and informative ,very personable. My husband had a curried vegetable dish with added chicken while I chose the steak hibachi dish. Atmosphere was dim lit modern setting and the floor plan for setting flows quite well.  I will definitely stop in again for dinner!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, if you wish to visit this location for lunch be sure to have a reservation and arrive a little earlier than 11:30am. The parking lot was busy and little hectic when I first arrived. I went for a team outing with my co-workers and the ambiance is relaxed and inviting. While it may initially appear to be pricey, the lunch menu items were no more than $13 and the Sushi menu was around the same price point. So, even if you're just trying to impress someone for lunch, you will not break the bank (always a win in my book)!   Once we were seated, our server was attentive and very polite (unfortunately I didn't catch his name). We received our drinks and food within a reasonable time, so there's no complaint regarding the service. And if you ordered water, then you can expect a refill every two minutes (lol). I may be exaggerating a bit, but for all 5 water refills at my table, I received only 2 refills of tea. My co-workers and I just laughed it off but it may be more helpful if customers were at least asked if they would like a refill or not.   Once we received our food, I was super excited because the Asain Pork Pot Stickers were amazing! However, my food was just.... ok! It wasn't bad but it also wasn't phenomenal! The rice was really good, but the meat and veggies could've used more sauce/spices.   I will definitely try them another time and give their sushi menu a chance."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I decided to stop in for a last minute dinner. Many of the seats were occupied, but my friend and I were able to be seated with no wait. Dinner consisted of fried potstickers, the Bruce Lee roll, the Zen roll, and paella Valencia. I've had the paella at the sister restaurant, Miro- so I knew what to expect. Everything else was a first. The sushi rolls were delicious and the dumplings and paella were on point. I will return here, especially with Duck Donuts only a few storefronts away- this could be trouble!"}
