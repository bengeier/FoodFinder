{"text":"Wow! The smothered pork chops were on point, as well as the fried pork chops. The chef exceeded my  expectations. There was a guy waiting when we arrived and he got up and left before his meal arrived, I'm glad we did not follow his lead for he missed out! I'd rather wait than have some uncooked meat. I wish Anointed One all the best!"}
{"text":"Had the catfish, green beans and rice and beans. The catfish had a light cornmeal breading and wasn't the least bit oily.  The rice and beans has small sausage crumbles and pieces of sausage it is and was probably the best I have had in this city.  The green beans had bits of. bacon in it.  Overall I am thoroughly impressed."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic southern comfort food!  Finally a place for real fried chicken in Madison.   This is my new happy place."}
{"text":"New and next door to my office, today my first visit and I really enjoyed it.  Let me start by saying, I'm the pickiest Italian Beef eater ever. The Italian Beef here didn't disappoint!  It was tasty and I found I ate well past my own point of discomfort.  I need to come back and try more, but for what I had today, 5 stars all the way.  Tip: If you're in a hurry for lunch, call ahead.  This is a family buissness and everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"Seeing that a soul food restaurant was opening next door to my office filled me with great joy and anticipation. That space has had many restaurants try and fail over the years. Everything from a Quiznos to a Chinese restaurant, yet none seem to stay more than a year or so.

Sadly after my first visit to Anointed One, I don't think it will be here long either.

I ordered the brisket for $14. Other options on the menu included smothered pork chop, fried chicken, fried catfish, and ribs. Dinners include 2 sides and cornbread.

I feel the best measure of a soul food restaurant are 3 things, Greens, Mac and Cheese, and Cornbread. So those were the sides I ordered. 

We'll start with the greens they had for the day, cabbage. The cabbage itself was made in a classic greens style with bacon and spices. The cabbage itself was overdone, but overall the flavor was good due to the pot likker it was cooked in. Very tasty. I found myself wishing it was collard or some other greens because the flavor of the cabbage just didn't hold up to the likker.

While the greens were tasty, the Mac and Cheese was not. It was a bland, boring, and had a paste like consistency due to the noodles being well overcooked. I moved on quickly to the cornbread.

As the final of the three sides, I feel a restaurant's cornbread can speak volumes about how much they care about the food being made. The bread was warm as though it had been microwaved, not a great thing for carryout. Thankfully my walk to my desk was less than 2 minutes, so the bread had not yet hardened. IMHO Cornbread should either be soft and moist like a cake, or have a grit to it like the corn meal was just milled by hand earlier that day. Unfortunately this had neither. Bland flavor with a dry and firm but mealy texture. I would guess this came straight from a box, and if it didn't, its a recipe that should get an overhaul.

So, 2 strikes but the \"greens\" were promising. There was still hope...... That hope was quickly dashed as I got to the brisket.

The first thing I noticed was that the 3 large slices of meat were smothered in BBQ sauce. Normally this is a sign of an amateur, or someone trying to cover up bad BBQ. Next I noticed that the brisket had a HUGE fat layer between the flat and the point, another sign of someone new to BBQ since that should be trimmed out. There was almost no fat cap or bark to be found either. So when I started trying to cut it and found it tough and overdone, I wasn't surprised. The flavor was also disappointing. I couldn't tell if it was the sauce or the meat, but there was a heavy liquid smoke flavor going on that was tough to get past. I couldn't really taste anything else and it's still hanging around. Strike 3.

Its pretty clear these folks are new to soul food and they probably aren't their grandmother's recipes. I would give 2 stars for the cabbage, but considering I paid almost $15 for a meal I didn't eat much of this is a definite 1 star. Not sure if I'll even be giving a second try like I normally do since it wasn't busy and the service wasn't a problem. Maybe if they survive the year I'll give it a shot."}
{"text":"This place do not deserve one star! We couldn't even order our meal we were told they couldn't take our order because they have a catering order.. not only did she wait until we figure out what we wanted off the menu, she had her whole family in there waiting on her and they had to call her to come out the back to service us. Once again she waited and let us pick our food to say she couldn't take us. Very upset for that to be our first visit there. That place need to take business more serious and get more serious workers! Not your family!!"}
{"text":"Four of us retired people went to lunch today at The Anointed One.  What a pleasant experience!  I give it five stars for doing just what it intends to do:  serve delicious soul food to its patrons.  I had not been there since long ago when the site was an Indian restaurant.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the tasteful remodeling job that had been done.  The restaurant was very neat and extremely clean as well.  We were helped by a super-friendly wait person who was the daughter of the owner/cook.  The menu was extensive and it was difficult to choose what to order.  Our waitress was extremely patient (cheerfully so!) with our many questions and caveats (at our ages, there are many no-nos and some dislikes!).  We finally settled on our orders, three of us ordering the Thursday special which was fried chicken and the trimmings.  We really enjoyed the chicken and all the sides we chose (from a very large menu of sides!).  The chicken was fried just right, very crisp.  The chicken and all the sides were very hot.  We enjoyed the collard greens, yams, mac and cheese, onion rings, cole slaw.  (and cornbread)  The price was very reasonable and I took half of my meal home.  I did not have room for dessert but the others enjoyed apple upside down cake and banana pudding.  I had a spoonful of each and can vouch for their quality and deliciousness!  There were quite a few desserts offered and all are made in house.  You can taste that.  We learned that on every other Sunday night, seafood gumbo is offered.  I am looking forward to returning for that!  Before we planned this outing, I had read a few negative reviews about the restaurant (about the service, attitude, and unavailability of foods on the menu).  We found the service to be outstanding, the attitude unmatched.  They could not do enough for us and checked often to be sure we were \"happy\" and taken care of.  There was only one thing they were out of today, the macaroni salad in the very long list of sides was out.  No problem for us!  If you want to try home-cooked soul food in a warm and coddling atmosphere, hurry over to The Anointed One!  
We are a lunch group that meets weekly and have tried many dozens of restaurants in Madison and the surrounding area over the last 10 years.  I can't think of any place where we have received a warmer welcome.  Several of our members were not able to come today--too bad for them! 
We arrived later than usual today, oneish.  I was pleased to see that some people were coming in steadily all afternoon even though lunchtime was well past.  These people deserve to be well patronized!  I wish them well!"}
{"text":"I don't know why they aren't open during their scheduled hours.  My friends and I have tried FIVE TIMES in the past two months and ended going elsewhere.  They need to be more serious and professional with their business.  Since there is another Anointed One and they owned Thulassi, they could step up and actually run the restaurant.  We sat there well past their opening time with the Sysco guy and then ended up at Swagat.  Mr. Delivery brought me food later from Anointed One."}
{"text":"Well, this place is definitely a work in progress. Strange to transition from an Indian restaurant to such a meat based soul food restaurant. We went on a Thursday evening, the same day that a glowing review was posted on Madison.com, but we were the only ones in the place:  http://host.madison.com/ct/entertainment/dining/restaurants/let-s-eat-anointed-one-is-good-for-the-soul/article_5ce2fc83-a70a-5fd9-bc60-3d702f4e6460.html

The promise of a shrimp po' boy sandwich took us there, but sadly, it was not available on the daily menu. In some ways it is a great idea to only offer what is fresh that day, but on the other hand, that leaves minimal options to choose from. 

The staff was very friendly, and took good care of us. The food came out promptly. Decor was ok, big photos of the food (including the items that weren't available), and neon open signs with the cords hanging down. Also, we were sitting by the windows, and it was a bit chilly.  Weird that there was a table of random (nonfood items) gift baskets for sale. 

I got the fried catfish, which was cooked very well, not greasy at all, and the crispy batter was absolutely fantastic! I had to ask for tartar sauce, but it was quickly brought to me. Hubby got the smothered pork chop, which while it wasn't too appetizing to look at, the gravy was yummy and it was the perfect comfort food for a chilly night. They macaroni and cheese was creamy, and came out piping hot. Cornbread was standard- nothing much to say. The French fries were also perfectly fried, with a wonderful seasoning. The slaw was REALLY good - even the hubs went to town on it, and he is NOT a slaw guy. The serving size of the slaw was gigantic- we took quite a bit home. 

I was going to give it a three, but as I wrote this out, it appears that I had nothing but good to say about the actual food! If I could give it a 3.5, I would, due to the few items on the menu vs advertised options,  ambience, and the complete lack of vegetarian options. When/if business picks up, they hopefully will be able to stock more food options, and I do plan on going back to try the po' boy - but will call first this time to make sure they have them!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and nice menu variety. We were a table of three for dinner and, unfortunately, the first meal came out ten minutes or more before the other two were served."}
{"text":"This is a fairly tough review.

It's a new restaurant so finding information for a menu online is going to be tough. The big issue however is that the menu here literally changes every day, and there's no way to be able to figure it out unless you physically walk in and look.

Half of the menu was already gone for the day, so we weren't really able to choose from much outside of pork chops and burgers. The burger I had was actually pretty good, as well as being quite dense as opposed to some burgers that aren't really nurtured into much from a chain restaurant. The fries were about average.

What's unfortunate here is that this restaurant has pictures of iconic soul food oriented cooking. The issue, it's not available on the menu... many of the recommended foods to try: meatloaf, brisket, gumbo, shrimp poboy... none of it was available to even sample.

Tough to really say much beyond needing a second try. The Yams however are amazing, and worth getting if you need a safe side-dish to try out."}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday evening with a few friends and we were the only people there. The service was kind and timely and the food was excellent. I ordered the Chicken dinner and the fried chicken was moist and flavorful and the French Fries were excellent (seriously - some of the best I've had in Madison). The pricing was reasonable as well. 

I would definitely recommend! I'm planning to go back. I just hope they get enough business to stay open; they're kinda on a quiet part of the West Side."}
