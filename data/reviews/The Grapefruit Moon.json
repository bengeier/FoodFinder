{"text":"Small menu, small venue. Very casual, not for a date. We got our food an hour after we ordered it (burger and fries). We got our meals at different time (20 minutes apart). Fries were cold and so was the burger. Hot chocolate was cold too.   Over all experience was not good. Very dingey atmosphere which would be fine if food was good but it was cold and took a very long time.  Server was nice. However got a few small discount considering how late the food was and how cold it was..."}
{"text":"Moon chips were amazing.  Would have been a higher rating if both staff members hadn't spent most out of dinner on their phones instead of providing service."}
{"text":"-good food -reasonable prices -drip coffee  -open early -kid friendly -wide range of options, including lots of vegan and veg.   -good beers on tap  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"My all around favorite spot for brunch. I love the relaxed neighborhood vibe and sitting on their wonderful patio. Their food is amazing - who knew a simple breakfast meal could be so good. I also love their house made hot sauce.  They have really friendly waiters and they do a cute artist of the month display which I love.   My only complaint is that the portion sizes are always on the smaller size and I love their food so much so I always want more.   I always end up coming back here when I want brunch that I know will taste amazing."}
{"text":"Grapefruit Moon SEEMS like a charming a place. It also SEEMS like it has an inviting atmosphere and really awesome staff. And it SEEMED like this would be my regular spot with my roomies, seeing as we live directly across the street from it.  Seems like it. Isn't actually.  True, the food is pretty good and decently priced (although do NOT get the fish and chips. It's processed fish) and the beer list is varied. However, I've gone a number of times and the service is kinda bad. The staff aren't friendly at all, I would even say snobby, and I've definitely gotten that \"not welcome here\" vibe before which is really disappointing. My friends and I joke that we're not hispter enough for them.  Honestly I'd rather walk the extra few minutes to Victory where  what \"seems\" to be actually is."}
{"text":"Vegans: Beware the following review! I have gone to Grapefruit Moon many many times and have ordered quite a few things off their quirky menu..but never the burger! On the advice of my doctor, I need to eat more fatty foods (long story).  He specifically mentioned hamburgers!  So, I am currently on a Burger Binge.  And wouldn't you know it, Grapefruit Moon's burger has topped my list!  \"Why have I not tried this until now?\" I was thinking as the catsup/mayo/meat juice ran down my hand. In fact, I am thinking of hitting that thing again tonight!  Before you know it I'll have gained back all my weight!  My heart might not be so happy tho;)"}
{"text":"Only came here cause i thought it was a vegetarian restaurant. I was very dissapointed because the menu was NOT fully vegetarian but instead was half and half and there was not much of variety of foods. Reading the reviews below was totally a different experience for me. It seemed like the menu had changed alot! The food was okay but it felt like i could have made those kinds of foods at home so it wasn't very unique. There was only one server at the time so service was very slow ( waited for food for about 25mins ) The atmosphere looked very dingy... and not clean.. seemed more like a bar then a restaurant."}
{"text":"Located on Bathurst, 2 bustops north of Bloor, this small joint is a hidden gem in a cozy neighbourhood for basic diner-lunch type food.    You can also have beers there to even into the wee hours in the morning (Thurs to Sat I believe).  There is a patio too.    This place also has a special place in my heart because I used to live right above it in the 80's (it used to be a smoky, greasy Chinese take out place) while my parents had a shop right beside it.    Food I find is good to \"oh, that's quite good\".  Make sure to ask for their hot sauce (fresh, pepper creole sauce type).  Great for a low-key, unrushed date, or just a place to enjoy a snack, meal or drink in a relaxed enviornment.  Note, if you try to go for brunch on the weekend, it may be really crowded! (family and neighbourhood hot spot)"}
{"text":"Pretty good. The batista male server was very polite and nice. The food was pretty good"}
{"text":"Here's basically the top 5 reasons why I liked this place:   1. Great Atmosphere  2. Great potatoes on the side when you order breakfast  3. I love the coffee mugs - no two were the same!  4. I would recommend the vegan sandwich which was a delight!  5. I loved the assortment of beers and wines!   My only negative was the fact that the place was rather small and cramped, but I guess that is what is part of a great ambiance!"}
{"text":"This is a review of service, not the food. I went here with my boyfriend on a busy Saturday morning for brunch. Despite the average reviews we thought we'd give it a chance! Waited at the door for 5 minutes before being acknowledged and were told it would be a 15 minute wait. I did see 2 seats at the bar available....but assumed the space wasn't used during brunch. He didn't take our names and I told him I would wait outside. It's pretty crowded inside. 10 minutes later, after patiently waiting in the cold I see another couple walk down the street, go in, and immediately get seated at the bar. Huh??!! I went inside and was told there was still nothing available and that the couple sitting at the bar were ahead of us. I didn't make a fuss. I guess it's possible, but I'm very doubtful. Maybe they were friends, or regulars. But the experience made me feel like a second rate customer. Left immediately. Never going back."}
{"text":"They are never consistent. I never know what I'm going to get or what I'm even able to get. I've been there when they've run out of beer! No beer. At a bar. Let that sink in. I've always respected places that can run out of dishes on the menu. That implies that they're keep things fresh. But beer? That implies that they don't know what they're doing. The food is good. The food is great. If you can get what you want of their terrible menu. The service is great. And the atmosphere is odd. It used to be welcoming and quirky, now it just feels tense and unorganized. I used to love this place. But something changed. Now I either really love it, or am regretfully disappointed. Too bad that it's more often the latter."}
{"text":"Look, when you name your cafe after a Tom Waits song (Closing Time, 1973), I'm going to be strongly predisposed to like the place, but I'm also going to hate it violently if it's bad.  That said, I was quite relieved that Grapefruit Moon did not disappoint.  The huevos rancheros weren't exactly that but were tasty all the same; I'm awarding bonus points for the homemade tortilla and the outdoor seating.  The ambiance here is a little ramshackle, much like old Tom himself.  A good place to start the day."}
{"text":"Cute place, nice staff! We had brunch on the terrace, the food was good, nice eggs benedict, and cocktails were refreshing! Not too crowded, even for the Saturday brunch."}
{"text":"If you like toast and eggs and sausage with your beer this is the place for you. If possible, try to get a window seat on a summer day and watch the world go by. I've been going there every now and then, and with time, as I understand, the owners have changed. While I do miss the old touch, the new isn't necessarily worse. Still great people, laid-back atmosphere and friendly staff. Some rare local brews available, so treat yourself, as it's unlikely you'll get a pint of those in Moxies or whatever. Hipsters friendly, and I mean it in a good way."}
{"text":"I have been to Grapefruit Moon twice now, and I cannot sing its praises enough. It will be my go-to brunch spot from now on.  Upon entering (both times have been in winter, so no patio open) it's a bit of a cramped wait to get a table. It was also hard getting anybody's attention, nobody seemed to acknowledge us verbally (though we got stared at a few times). But never the less, when a table opened up 5 minutes later, we were promptly seated. Sometimes the wait can be a bit longer but if you're in good company, it passes quickly. And it gives you a chance to observe the quirky decorations.  I ordered the hot chocolate, which was decadent and creamy. First time I ordered the breakfast burrito and second time I ordered the breakfast quesadilla (with cheese and black beans for the filling). My only gripe is that I wish you could pick more than two fillings for the quesadilla, but at least it's fun to experiment. Both were flavorful and delicious, and the salsa that accompanies them (I think it's homemade?) just makes the dish tops. And as someone who loves her homefries, these guys have it down pat. No need for dipping in ketchup or adding extra salt, they have a great flavor all their own.  I can't wait to try other things on the menu as I am sure they will be just as good.  Both times, upon finishing my meal I had lots of time to chat with my friend(s) and not feel rushed. Be warned though, they never \"split the bill\". I don't know why this is, but both times I've gone, they just bring over one bill and I was told it can't be split into what we ordered separately. Though, you can pay for your part + tip by just adding it up in your head and putting that value on the debit machine.  Can't wait to try the patio when the weather warms up."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best, and most original breakfast spots in Toronto. Super chill atmosphere, and the food is delicious. Really nice service! Got the veggie waffle, and added bacon, and eggs. So good! The savoury waffle actually inspired me, I need a waffle iron know!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and we have been for brunch at grapefruit moon a few times before. We will never be going there again however because the service we had today was simply the rudest experience we've had since coming to Toronto. We're really sad about it because we used to love coming here to eat. I think it's a testament to how bad the service was at brunch today that so many different people are writing bad reviews.  we were ignored when we arrived, and our server took our order with the least amount of friendliness possible. as he delivered my husband's beer he threw the coaster on the table. that's really when we should have left. I ordered huevoes rancheros, and for $10 got two eggs with very little refried beans, salsa and guacamole and cold stale tortillas. it seemed that everyone around us with having an equally bad experience... the two guys sitting next to us were debating loudly whether to leave after they apparently received an undrinkable cup of coffee.  I told them what i'm telling you.... Just cut your losses and leave. I don't know what happened to this once lovely local spot, but i'm definitely never going there again."}
{"text":"This place used to be decent heck even very good. After not coming by for a few months I recently did and the changes were not positive. The menu is smaller and boring now. All the unique items that set it apart as a restaurant are gone. The food was not very good. The eggs for the benne were hard boiled not poached, and the home fries still had dirt on the skin of the potato. Not exactly worth 12 bucks if you ask me. The service is so so but not fantastic. The price does not reflect the quality you get at all. Would explain why getting a seat there for brunch has never been easier..."}
{"text":"Popped in here for lunch when staying at the Rose Garden B&B nearby & had the most delicious grilled cheese sandwich, with guacamole, tomato & mushrooms. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"I can always tell when the weather has turned because A. we get the urge to eat outside and B. Grapefruit Moon is packed with a line-up. This is one of many breakfast places in my rotation, usually getting a visit every couple of months. The first time we ate here was for dinner, but that was probably 10 years ago and we haven't been here later than 2pm ever since. The dinner was actually pretty good, as I recall, but we just never seem to get back.  I am a habitual eater and my habit here is Winston's Big Breakfast. Every time, including next time (although our server held out the possibility that I might try something new, once...maybe...). Actually, there is a really good selection of brunch items, including Blueberry Pancakes, Breakfast Quesadilla, heuveos Rancheros, Bacon & Eggs, French Toast, Grilled Cheese and more... but W.B.B. is where I put my vote. Eggs scrambled with a subtle amount of cheddar, bacon AND sausage (it is just wonderful not having to take sides in the breakfast meat debate every time I go out), nice chunks of potato well-browned, fluffy and always HOT. The toast (always multi-grain) comes very generously buttered, but you have to ask for jam. I almost never do but you can if it is a part of your complete breakfast. The jam is very good.  The home-made hot sauce gets its own line in the review, because it is just that good (although it was a little salty today...). Moderately hot, nicely spiced and generously provided. It is a thick-cut pepper sauce that stays put and adds a wonderful flavour to eggs and potatoes. Every time we eat here I say right out loud that THIS summer I am going to make my own pepper sauce... and then I realize that I am better off coming to Grapefruit Moon instead.  I drink the coffee here. I don't actually drink coffee ( I have never had Tim Horten's coffee and Starbucks is but a memory from the West Coast), but this is good breakfast coffee. Agent Cooper good. Today a woman came in for coffee to go. Know what she was carrying? Cherry pie."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast joint. Food is top-notch and prices are not exorbitant. Service can be slow as it is constantly busy but the food is worth it. The ambiance is quaint but it is clean.  The breakfast burrito is my favorite and portions are generous."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying it's my new favourite place to be for weekend brunch. It's usually packed but I never have had to wait long for seating at all. The atmosphere is great, homey feeling and cozy. The menu is in fact small but will not disappoint. Not to mention, they have a great patio!  The only small problem I have is that the coffee isn't amazing but good coffee at any breakfast place is rare. It doesn't taste like water and I don't have to go elsewhere after breakfast for my morning coffee."}
{"text":"the food is always super and there's something on the menu for everyone, regardless of dietary proclivities. the beer selection is top notch. and there is no better brunch patio in TO. but I wish that one server would get over himself. he knows who he is.  also can I just say, I really love their bathrooms."}
{"text":"Tasty!  No line up and we were there during peak brunch time on a Sunday. Based on other comments I'm not sure if this is the norm but it's all that I know and it was amazing! We're frequent brunchers and while I understand that good things come to those who wait....sometimes I've got a rumbly in my tumbly that needs to be satiated stat!   Service was friendly but a bit slow. My guess is that they weren't expecting the patio to fill up at this time of year.   Lots of options for my people....the vegetarians. I had the breakfast quesadilla and it was jam packed full of the toppings that I selected. Home fries were ok. Bit dry and bland but I'm not a hf lover so that was fine by me. My only real complaint was the tempeh. It's a nice surprise to be able to order a side of tempeh but it was a mistake. It was really dry and bland. No seasoning, sauce or anything to spruce it up. Poor tiny tempeh went untouched...all alone on a big ole empty plate.   Seating is a bit squishy but that seems to be a trend amongst the more popular brunch spots. It didn't bother us because the acoustics were fine. Nothing can ruin a brunch like a loud dinning room.  All round - thumbs up! We'll be back on those mornings when I just don't have it in me to wait for Aunties and Uncles."}
{"text":"Honest, laid-back comfort food.. with craft beer? The key to my heart. I enjoy Grapefruit Moon because they have everything from bacon poutine, to dishes that would appeal to the veg regs.   I got a veggie wrap, with a side of fries (gotta appropriately balance each meal right?) Every meal comes wittingly adorned with a slice of grapefruit, a cute touch on their resto name. My wrap was fresh, packed with an assortment colourful vegetables. I really enjoyed their tangy chunky hummus that accompanied every chomp from my spinach tortilla wrap. And gotta give a thumbs up to a restaurant who serves fresh cut fries.  They cycle through an impressively unique range of beers (on tap!) I was informed that they're always trying out different beers, and a single keg usually dwells on their ever-changing beer list for about a week or so.   Atmosphere is super casual and homey (as if you're at your buddy's place.. who cooks for you.. and poured you amazing beer..), however service is a little on the 'lax side. I would not advise you to try them out if you're in a rush, or expecting to be just in and out. But then again, this isn't the neighbourhood for that kind of clientele."}
{"text":"Came in for the Sunday brunch. The oj memosas were sweet and my grilled cheese was tasty. The place feels cloistered and slapdash, but that's the kind of atmosphere I prefer. The staff was friendly and helpful, and they played The Strokes on the jukebox, which is one of my favorite bands, so I was won over. 5 stars all around. Show up early for breakfast because the wait line went out the door by the time we left."}
{"text":"Busy place for brunch.  The seating indoors is limited but the patio in the summer makes up for it.  Service and food were great.  Friend was accidentally hit by a pot? which flew over the side of the back cubby hole...not sure what happened but the server was very apologetic and sweet.  Plus when it came time for the bill, my friend's meal was free.  Now, that's what you call customer service."}
{"text":"3 best tables are the 2 by the window on the left when u go in (if you're at the window be prepared to roast on a sunny day) and the little booth right in the back (check the local graffiti).  I've been coming here for years (even a bit before when the location used to be the victory). Food is comfort breakie and atmosphere can't be beat. Kid friendly with a books and a box of toys in the back.  If you're inclined make sure to ask for the homemade hot sauce. Mix with a little ketchup or straight drops if you like flavour."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Good beer choices, fantastic food, wonderful ambiance. The patio is wonderful, though they could do with better quality chairs.  I've had every meal of the day there, and they've all been fantastic. Usually I only order them because I go for drinks but can't turn down the amazing food on the menu...  Expect to have trouble getting a seat at breakfast or late on weekends, though. It's pretty tiny!"}
{"text":"A turn for the worst.  What used to be a nice local family hangout has become a place where families are not welcome and only youngster hip crowd is welcome. Let alone the menu is less exciting that it used to be and the blueberry pancakes are sorely missed.  So, we tried to get with my wife and little baby on stroller on the patio.  There was a young couple occupying a four seat table while a two seater was free next to it. We asked the waiter if he could ask the guys to swap tables so we could all fit in the sunshine. The waiter refused to ask, which was already annoying. I then offered to ask myself to the guys, which i did in a kind tone only to be told that they would not move as their teas (they were even done with their food) were too precious to be moved. Kindness is not a must, I understand but the lack of empathy/understanding from waiters and managers simply showed the new attitude. Bye bye families, welcome rude kids. And bye bye it is also from us, who live in the neighbourhood and went there for years."}
{"text":"Just wanted to follow up on my previous review.  This used to be my favourite breakfast place. The ownership has changed! I do not dislike it now, it's merely not up there anymore.   The Downs: -the once famous and unattaintable homemade hot sauce is gone -the menu has changed, plates are fixed -the prices are higher -the brews are different, less local stuff -the \"how would you like your eggs\" option has entirely vanished! SADDENING! -still no eggs benny  The Pluses: -the fixed plates that they have come in colossal portions. -music is fantastic -the breakfast poutine sounds nauseating, but it may be the greatest hangover cure out there right now -coffee still is stellar  I now have to search again for my new fave! Mar's Food and Maggie's from College street is up there!"}
{"text":"I remember when this location was the original Victory Cafe location back in the 1990s. Been going to the Moon since about January 1999. The place reminds of Alternative Grounds, with Beer (they actually used to serve Alternative Grounds' fair trade coffee). I mostly have brunch here, and meet friends that live in this neighbourhood. Very good omelettes. Good service. In the summer, the patio is great for people watching, though you should go inside and tell the staff that you are there, as it can be awhile before they realize new customers are there. On the rare occasion I eat here at night, I enjoy the fact that they have local craft beer on tap. All in all, this is local option for meeting people in the Seaton Village."}
{"text":"Dined in there around late August. The Kitchen is not fully divided from the front of the house. It is semi-divided. So that makes a hot day in the summer feel hotter. They didn't have AC. But that didn't bother me that much. Would of sat in the patio but outside felt way hotter.  The salad was so effing fresh and tasty. We had the chicken snack wrap and chicken tenders. Both were so good. Love the location. Loved the overall vibe of the place. Definitely a gem."}
{"text":"It's ok.  It's a wee little dumpy place that has some charm.  I've been there three times, unfortunately there was something wrong every time.  The first time I went, we ordered 3 lattes and got 2, we waited and waited and waited.  Eventually my friend went to see what was wrong and was told it was on its way.  We waited, we went back again (the server never came to the table) and we were told there was something wrong with the coffee machine.  So we said forget it.   The second time we ordered teas with our meals and they never came. The third time was on a cold night and there was no heating, the place was FREEZING, on top of that the server fucked up one of the pints, but he did comp it so I guess we can't complain about that.  But it was freezing, so I'm avoiding it for the rest of Winter."}
{"text":"I used to love this place especially their hot sauce. It has gone down the tube after their change in management."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! My bf and I went for brunch based on the reviews and the fact they claim to support local and organic ingredients, but couldn't be more disappointed. Food seemed reheated, whether it actually was or not, service was friendly yet forgetful and the ONLY decent thing was the cup of coffee.  Not making the trip here ever again."}
{"text":"The menu options were more limited than we had hoped, but for good reason as they certainly subscribe to the mantra of \"stick to your strengths\" We both ordered Grilled Cheese sandwiches (one vegan, one regular) which come with your choice of 3 toppings and cheese. They were both delicious and are certainly worth a trip back to enjoy again. Their house made hot sauce is drinkable and not too hot for those with less tolerance. The service was slow, and the food was as well but overall would certainly recommend!"}
{"text":"Got there right when they opened the the day, first customer in the door. The outdoor seating filled up relatively quickly after that. Food was great, place was great, staff was friendly and great. I had the full moon breakfast, simple food cooked right! The homemade hot sauce and coffee were highlights."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with delicious food, great hot sauce and friendly service.   I've been here twice already - once for brunch and another time for dinner. Both meals were impressive! The breakfast poutine was delicious - picture perfectly cooked eggs with runny yolk sitting on top of a mound of poutine with rich gravy. The real winner, however, was the hamburger. You have an option of going with pork or beef - I chose the beef. It was a decent size, came with fries and one day a week, there is a great burger and a pint deal.   Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"While my family and I (husband and toddler/baby) were regulars for years, I hadn't been back since just shortly after the management changed.  The new menu just wasn't enticing to me, as it seemed far from the casual, cheap, comfort food we were used to and happy with.   It seemed that they had changed back to pub-style food so we ventured there recently to check it out. For a Friday night, albeit a cold one, it was really slow, and I missed the energy that the former busy mix of people provided.  Our food took quite awhile to arrive, despite the slow evening - or because of it? We ate a cheeseburger, poutine, house salad and kids' Mac and cheese. It was good. Not great, but fairly good. I couldn't help feel underwhelmed. I thought the prices were just a bit too high for what was provided. There are other pubs nearby with better food for less money (Victory, for example).   Anyway, I will be back, regardless, because I like supporting my local restaurants and, really, $12 for a burger/fries/coleslaw is nowhere near exorbitant. But I do miss the old Grapefruit Moon."}
{"text":"An amazing meal! My partner and I stopped by after touring the Casa Loma. We were immediately greeted with the friendliest service. We ordered Keith and Sailor's Pick with aioli dips. One of the best meals we've ever had. And their hot sauce was incredible. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because it's near by but this was the 3rd visit and I wasn't impressed. I ordered the fancy french toast and was disappointed. The French toast was okay but the fruit was that came with it was terrible.  It was a rum banana concoction and the banana was too ripe (dark brown black) and though it was smothered in sauce, it tasted terrible.  The other fruit, namely the strawberries tasted like they were cut with the same knife that was used to cut an onion or something. The only good thing is the cozy atmosphere and the friendly server."}
{"text":"Weekend Kickstart.  After a quick latte stop at Manic, I hiked up here with my intrepid dining-companion-turned-foodtographer Emily \"cheese please\" H.  I had tried Grapefruit Moon once in the summer, and hadn't been back due solely to the distance.  Cute décor, though the place is a bit (understated) crowded and tight to navigate.  I've seen larger washrooms on WestJet flights.  Still, Emily and I waited a mere ten minutes and scored a cozy booth at the back that had walls on three sides and a curtain (optionally closed) on the fourth.  Because the kitchen is at the side of the restaurant, this was a fairly low-traffic area.  Emily had the two-item omelette (she went for brie and mozzarella) while I was thinking yo quiero huevos rancheros.  Both plates showed up nicely presented; on mine the folded tortilla peeked out from beneath separate piles of eggs, beans and guacamole with salsa off to the side and hallmark grapefruit garnish.  It was enough to induce plate envy in my companion until she got a bite of her doubly-delicious two-cheese medley and lost all desire to stray from her own plate.  I tried it too; one bite of that omelette was enough to make me regret my own (still delicious) choice.   It's usually really hard to get a coffee refill over brunch (hence the latte stop in advance).  Service wasn't overly attentive, but we were taken care of and the cup was kept full.  That's al I ask.  Three-and-a-half stars, rounded up."}
{"text":"Great bar, love the atmosphere. Wish the patio would stay open later but i suppose thats a bilaw issue that they cant help. I forgot my wallet there with over 300 in cash and they returned it to me the next day with all the cash still there. I was very impressed with the staff"}
{"text":"I'm a carnivore, but the first time I came here I got the Vegan Scramble. It was a bit of a miss - probably a bad choice given my proclivities - so I didn't go for a long time. It's a bit of a walk from the subway, Futures was always closer (and cheaper).   So one Fall day I returned - because Insomnia had a line - and had their breakfast burger. I've had it three times since, even split it because it's so filling with all those home fries on the sides and I'm drooling a little just thinking about it. It's absolute perfection, especially coupled with their home-made hot sauce- which they make extra chunky for the tables. I love it so much I got a jar. Last time I also tried the Breakfast poutine, which is apparently a thing and also very good. I think they make it with Hollandaise sauce? Yum.  They even have a student special, so we got a stout on tap to pair with breakfast for cheaper.  Someday I plan to come back and try their dinner food, but they have customizable Grilled Cheese sandwiches, so I'm sure it will happen one of these days."}
{"text":"Love this place but I miss the vegan bacon, and they used to have tons of awesome craft beers. Now they have a very limited selection and I miss the diversity.  The staff are really awesome, but they really need more choice in beer. There aren't any ciders, nor any wheat beers and any craft bar with 12 taps, like the Moon has, should have one of each at all times!"}
{"text":"Came by here for breakfast. They do a good job with the food. The server for some reason wouldn't be flexible at all. For example they don't have an omelette on the menu, but my sister in law got one there 2 weeks ago. They refused to make it. The service was so-so."}
{"text":"I had their fancy French toast and absolutely loved it! It is a very cozy space, great for enjoying time with close friends or a date."}
{"text":"Came in by myself and the place was empty.  I took a seat next to the window and had the restaurant to myself.  They serve breakfast until 10PM and I came in at 4PM so I ordered the big breakfast, 3 eggs scrambled, home fries, toast, sausage, bacon, a little greens, and a slice of grapefruit.  They have a very good homemade sauce that poured over the meats and home fries, they called it hot sauce but it wasn't really spicy.  For a big breakfast the portions weren't that big but the food did taste good, nothing memorable.  I will be back to try something on their menu other than breakfast and I'll update my review then."}
{"text":"I'm a bit puzzled by the rave reviews for this place. My friends love it as well so maybe my mediocre experiences are plain bad luck. But when the bad luck continues on the 5th and 6th visit, my goodwill runs out. First, the service is pretty indifferent. Example: the beers on tap rotate but the servers can't tell you what they are. You have to get up from your table and go see a chalkboard. I guess it's too much trouble to memorize 10 names or print a list every week and include it with the menu. In which case maybe you should be tipping me and not the other way around. Second issue, all too often it's amateur hour in their kitchen. I've had (on separate occasions) overcooked eggs, cold potatoes and a cheddar bacon pancake so burnt it was practically charcoal. Now even accepting that this place may shine on occasion (see all the glowing brunch reviews) I live a couple of blocks away and generally avoid Grapefruit Moon. It's just not worth the 50/50 risk of getting a sloppy mess served by a surly waitress."}
{"text":"Good eggs and burgers, a small place for a casual breakfast or brunch, the staff is pretty good and the tap selection is big. We enjoyed the food and we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Come on a Monday morning at 9:30 and you won't have to wait to experience the eclectic hipster vibe with glass milk bottles for water and mismatched tableware.  The standard all-day breakfast, which 3 of us had, was above average for three reasons -- the coffee was excellent (Alternative Grounds, Roncesvalles), as was the choice of toast (the multi-grain was great) and they offered veggie bacon. The eggs and home fries were pretty average --  the home fries looked great, but were a tad bland and forgettable.  The fourth in our party (\"the rebel\") went off-script and ordered the Breakfast Quesadilla. (2 eggs grilled with a flour tortilla  stuffed with your choice of 2 fillings, served with home fries & salsa. Fillings were; Cheddar, Chevre, Feta, Roasted Red Peppers, Avocado, Onion, Hot Peppers, Black Bean, Pinto Bean, Mozzarella, Brie, Tomato, Sundried Tomato.) She proclaimed it \"gorgeous\".  Our server was friendly and efficient, and kept the coffee flowing. Grapefruit Moon has a nice, comfy feel."}
{"text":"I gave up my gym day to come here. Not to Grapefruit Moon specifically, but just to a patio. Since my fiancé and a friend were going to be in the area, I let them find a place. My requirement was simple; patio obviously and drinks. Food wasn't so important and Grapefruit Moon fit the bill.  We got the last table and I sat in the spot directly facing the sun (whoop!). Beer menus are written on a small whiteboard and my first choice was the Steam Whistle Pilsner, and then I had a Flying Monkey. Cold Beer + Hot Day = Beer belly (but happiness!)  This is mainly a brunch place, so the menu is quite limited. They had some Corn Fritters which were sold out so I am guessing they are very yummy. I opted for their egg special dish which came with Bononcini Cheese (I was expecting bigger rounds, but all I got were small pea-shaped things...) Hit the spot, but nothing special.  The rest of the table had a burger with fried bacon and egg (filling) and a breakfast special that came with the usual sausages, egg, home fries. It must have been our way of staying longer at the table because we decided to order French Toast as our dessert. Again, hit the spot, but nothing special.  So yes, come here for their patio and drinks. It's a lovely local spot that is hidden and takes advantage of full sunshine. I wouldn't come here any other time as the interior of the building (dark, dark) and the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews, I knew just to what do when I arrived early to meet my friends at Grapefruit Moon. The weather was iffy, so I opted to wait in line for an indoor table, rather than brave potential rain on the (covered) patio.  By the time the last person showed up, a table opened up immediately. I also knew to order the quesadilla and the non-drip coffee. I was all set, while my other friends perused the menu, I was able to stare at my friends brand new engagement ring!  Thanks, Yelp.   Good call on the quesadilla and the hot sauce! I didn't need any of the side of salsa, I poured half a bottle of that hot pepper sauce on my home fries and tortilla.  Friends both were happy with the food, though not ecstatic.  We were able to lounge all morning without being rushed.  Next time, maybe I'll try the faux bacon!"}
{"text":"My friend and I met in Friday morning for breakfast before heading off to class, which was a lovely way to start the day.  We sat in a sunny corner of the restaurant and had a cup of coffee while we decided what to order.  My friend went with the grilled cheese with half homefries, half fruit. I choose scrambled eggs with half and half as well. Our server told us that they only had grapefruit and strawberries which we agreed would be just fine.  The food looked lovely when it arrived. My eggs were perfectly cooked, as were the homefries.   Their homemade hot sauce is delicious! Fragrant and flavourful. It's also quite hot.  The fruit that arrived with our meal was miserable looking. We received several slices of grapefruit that looked dry and sad. I suspect that they had been sliced some time before they were served to us. We got about two strawberries, which as they're out of season, tasted like nothing and were on the mushy side. Yuck.  All in all most things were really pleasant. The fruit situation however was inexcusable. Don't serve ugly, dried out, old, molding grapefruit. Especially if it's in the joint's name."}
{"text":"Perfect for a brunch following a long day or a rough night.   Have been frequenting this place for a while now and I absolutely love it, the servers are few and often busy however they try their best to deliver good service.   The food is great...wanna be hipster mexican-organic breakfast..best to describe this place really. They offer a nice selection of beers, haven't tried it yet...too early to drink when I go in. The coffee is nice however the space is limited, preferably to go during hot days where sitting in their patio is more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, a nice cozy place to eat with friends, and decent prices. I had their curry chicken wrap and it was delicious, along with their fries!"}
{"text":"The first impression is that this is a proper hipster place, the cups for water are plastic children's cups, all the furniture are odds and ends and I even found a penny on the floor! The lock to the washroom door is a hook and there isn't even a door knob on the inside. Everything screams I just don't give a f$@#. The menu ranges from the classic's to new and creative. I ordered one of each, a corn waffle that comes with sour cream and salsa and eggs benny. Both were very good. As hipster as this place is, the service is surprisingly better than you would expect, part of the reason is because it's a intimate environment and it's easy to keep an eye on everyone as a server. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite breakfast/ brunch spots to go to! Pretty decent sized portions and a really cozy atmosphere if you sit on the inside. However! Due to my last visit I don't think I will be taking advantage of their patio ever again. womp-womp :( It's too bad because it is really neat how they have old stadium benches for their seats. How cool is that right?? There were just WAY too many bees for me and my friends to enjoy our meal fully. Granted- It could have just been that day but it still inclines me to sit on the inside from now on. It was almost like Hitchcocks \" the birds\" but with bees..haha.   BUT onto the food: Get the breakfast burger if you want to happy for days. They make their own sausage patty in house and it is amazing! They also have their own hot sauce which might be my favourite in the whole city. Totally pick a bottle up from there if you go! Oh- And if you go on weekends they have breakfast specials which are really great too like pancakes and waffles and such.   Moral of the story is wake up early and go get some breakfast!"}
{"text":"So we arrived on a Sunday right after brunch ended, as we were looking for place to eat. We arrived at the restaurant and grabbed a nice shaded spot outside, while we waited a long time for lukewarm water to arrive, and then waiting for our orders to be taken as we were in a rush. After waiting for at least 10 minutes, we walked in to order take-away breakfasts. My first choice was unfortunately sold out as it was later in the afternoon, but we quickly order the half moon and big bang breakfast sets. The man who took our order said it would be a few minutes, and I emphasized that we were in a rush because we had to catch a train. After waiting for about 20 minutes, he apologized for the long wait and offered some complimentary soda, which was nice, but once again, we were in a rush so we declined. Finally, we got our food after at least half an hour later, and we rushed off. Only to find out that our simple breakfasts of scrambled eggs, toast, and hashbrowns was incorrect. They me the wrong eggs and toasts. I'm sorry, but it's a simple breakfast set, and the place wasn't even busy. I don't understand how the service was so bad. The food was just average. Overall, I would not go back here again."}
{"text":"Grapefruit Moon located on Bathurst Street is a pretty sweet little cafe.  The interior of the cafe is very quant and charming with kitschy decor.  The breakfast menu is rather large but simple allowing classic breakfast ingredients to dominate the flavour.  I really enjoy the infusion of Mexican and breakfast and Grapefruit has a few Spanish options. Delicioso!  The lunch menu has a large selection of quesadillas as well. I have sampled a couple of breakfast items and the simplicity of the dishes works very well.  Prices are reasonable, mostly under $10 for a tasty sandwich or breakfast entrée. My favorite part of Grapefruit is the outdoor patio that has an old claw foot bath tub full of flowers! I love this.  Because I'm still in love with you on this grapefruit moon=)"}
{"text":"Their brunch is pretty darn good (if you can get a seat). I would recommend you go for breakfast.Their dinner's however? Lacking in my personal opinion. We had a garden salad with grilled chicken, and a chicken quesadilla. Neither were very good, and at $12 for each, we felt a little let down. The quesadilla didn't have much filling, and the plate looked quite empty despite the fries that came with it. The salad was about as basic as you can come, and not very large. Overall, meh."}
{"text":"The patio is nice, the food was ok but nothing amazing and the service was really really bad! The waitress forgot to bring us the menus but at least we were on the patio and it was sunny so we were not in a rush. She then forgot to bring us one item we ordered (but it was on the bill at the end) and the pancakes came with no maple syrup and my bf had to go inside to ask for it as our waitress disappeared (and only reappeared when it was time to pay the bill) and the other waiters didn't care and were kind of rude. I am glad I gave it a try but I will never go there again and I was expecting more after reading the other reviews."}
{"text":"I had been to Grapefruit Moon a few times over the last 2 years and was always disappointed. Every time I gave this place another try, I left discouraged because the food was really boring and under seasoned. Despite the friendly atmosphere, the food was always mediocre and tasteless.  A few weeks ago, a friend in the food industry heard the Moon was getting an overhaul with new management and a new chef. Rumour has it the chef worked for Susur Lee for many years, so we were definitely going to give this place another try.   We took a big chance and went for brunch on Thanksgiving Monday. Just our luck because they were launching their new menu that day. Well, we were not disappointed with the food. It was simple, comforting,and tasty! I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and my friends ordered the flat iron steak and eggs, and the Southern Italian style poached eggs. All three dishes were delicious. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The tomato sauce served with the poached eggs was really tasty. The fried chicken was crispy with a nice light batter, and the waffle was nice and light as well.   Service on the other hand was disappointing :( Apparently they were short staffed that day, which was really unfortunate. I hope they get their front of the house in order because the food was really good. Other patrons in the restaurant were as equally excited with the new menu. Yay! Grapefruit Moon. It's about time!!!! This place was in desperate need of an overhaul."}
{"text":"I liked this place! Went to grab takeout with Tiffany N, and as she mentioned our order for five was ready pretty quickly.  I got the pulled pork sandwich with fries which was fantastic. Super saucy pulled pork and yummy fries. I feel like this could be a bit of a magical brunch place, though it is small, so go elsewhere if you don't like intimate spots.   The place has a super laid back vibe, and the guy behind the bar who took our order was kind. I feel like they probably have some regulars.  One thing? Air conditioning guys, for real.  I know the open door might make it seem bigger, but sweltering Toronto temperatures can destroy the vibe here.  I'd definitely pop by again if I am ever in the neighborhood...if it's fall, winter or spring!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Grapefruit Moon this weekend.  It has a very relaxed atmosphere and is definitely cozy.  Due to the rain, we chose to sit inside but the patio is very nice and would be a nice place to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon or dinner. Inside felt very stuffy due to the hot weather and how small it is, but thankfully, the good music made up for it.  I went with the classic French toast, served with maple syrup and and fresh fruits ($10) whereas my boyfriend got Winston's Big Breakfast, which came with three scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage and a generous amount of bread. ($10). I have tried french toast all over the city, and this one was definitely a good one. The drizzled cinnamon definitely gave it a nice touch and the portion was quite large.  The fruits were fresh, especially the strawberries.   The big breakfast was a little on the bland side, especially the scrambled eggs.  The potatoes also looked like they needed a bit more seasoning.  Nonetheless, great value for the quality.      The coffee isn't anything to rave about, but you do get an unlimited amount. You can tell this is such a laid-back joint, as not two cups were the same.  The staff were also really friendly and unpretentious."}
{"text":"In the annex/Seaton Village, north of Bloor there is a severe lack of brunch spots. This is essentially the only option if you want a trendy spot. It's good because you can usually get in without a line unlike on Bloor, BUT, the service, food and place are all average. There is a nice balcony that's small to medium sized, although in the summer there is not a great awning for protection."}
{"text":"I've wanted to check this place out for years, just because of its name.  Nathan and I were trolling Bathurst street last weekend, looking for all day breakfast. We passed by this place and decided to try it. It was a warm day (for October) and their patio was open. He got a bacon sandwich, and I got the Huevos Rancheros. We both got coffee, which was very good. The Huevos Rancheros were great, it was served deconstructed, unlike most places that put it all together. The avocados were fresh, the over easy eggs were perfectly runny and the beans were good. The homemade (i think) salsa was also very good.   All in all, good food, decent service (relaxed to slow-ish, but we were on the patio). Will return again."}
{"text":"Everything that has happened to Grapefruit Moon makes me sad. I live down the street, and I've been a regular for about three years. A couple of months ago, ownership changed. I don't know the details, but from what I gleaned, it seems like a hostile takeover between sisters. The old beloved owners and all the staff are out. New ones are in.   I went today for brunch. Service sucked. We were ignored for awhile, waiting about fifteen minutes for menus. There were three servers, but they were all pretty useless. My first coffee had curdled milk. They forgot cutlery. They forgot the beans on my Huevos Rancheros. They also switched out the normal wheat tortilla for two corn tortillas, which they didn't heat them up, so they were cold and hard. We had to go to the bar to pay our bill, as the servers kept running past us to the patio. Our experience there was not unique, as the other tables inside were equally as frustrated.  As we were leaving, my boyfriend noticed an additional $3 charge for a substitution that it always free of charge. He asked the server to remove it, which she refused. \"We never do that,\" she replied. He explained that he had been eating brunch there every weekend for two years, and he had never been charged. \"Fine,\" she said. \"But we will never do that again.\"  And that's when we decided that we would never go there ever again. Thanks, new owners, for the hostile take over my favourite place and then running it into the ground."}
{"text":"Just came here recently for the second time.  To be honest, I didn't really remember anything remarkable about the first time.  Second visit was way better.  This place is convenient to attend the theatre close by, which is how I ended up here twice.  Showed up this time on burger and a pint, which is depending on which beer and hamburger you choose can be a great deal.  Place is definitely on the smaller side and it was busy.  Fun, relaxed vibe to it - lots of students working on school work.  One server, one cook - great, friendly service.  Overall, enjoyed my time much better this round than before.  Much more interested in coming back another time.  I thought it was a pretty decent place, great dining special and good food."}
{"text":"Recently went here with some friends and really enjoyed it.  The food was great, though they seemed to be out of some stuff.  I recommend the huevos rancheros or the breakfast burrito.  It is a bit crowded and difficult to get around, but despite that really enjoyed it. Good local brunch spot."}
{"text":"I came on a friday night after 8pm.  It was quiet.  There was only 1 server who had to look after 10 tables, which made service slow.   I had the beet salad, which was nothing special.  The beets are shaved and didn't taste fresh, I couldn't taste beet flavor.   There was a generous amount of walnuts and cheese. Also had the grilled cheese which you can build yourself by selecting the  ingredients.  This was good, but something that can be made at home easily. Also tried a burger, which wasn't very memorable.    Overall, food was okay, but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Just a great comfy feel to the place.  I've been there a few times and the food is always comforting and delicious.  This most recent time it was a little busy and it took 30 minutes to get a coffee refill and a tea - though we didn't even say anything and they comped these off our bill (points for the quiet customer service)... Definitely a quality neighbourhood joint with a great vibe!"}
{"text":"A chill weekend brunch joint with good food.    First time I stumbled upon Grapefruit moon was for late night drinks and tried the Curry Fries (died and gone to heaven delicious) and that tempted me to go back someday...  After hearing such great reviews for this place, we decided to venture there for brunch... it was everything you'd expect in a hole-in-the wall restaurant.  There are few items on the menu: 2 regular breakfast options (eggs, meat, potatoes, etc) and Huevos Rancheros, Huevo Mexicano (huevos ranchero's without the tortilla), some sandwich options and pancakes.   I was told to get the HUEVO MEXICANO - which was delicious!  The avocado and re-fried beans were freshly made.  The eggs were a touch flavourless but a sprinkle of salt and pepper did the trick.  Also tried the WINSTON'S LARGE BREAKFAST: 3 scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, toast and potatoes.  It was hefty proportionally but not too lumberjack-y for a breakfast selection.  Overall, the service was awesome.  We sat outside and it was raining, the waitress was very attentive and brought the food out in the rain.  The decor is not what you want to go for: tacky old garbage stapled to the walls.  Not the most clean place you could go to, but the value and taste of the menu makes this place well worth the visit.  Few vegetarian options too, which is nice for the veggie eaters!  TIPS:  Outdoor seating is first come, first serve.  Indoor seating is seated by the staff.  MUST ASK FOR: the HOT SAUCE, it's a jalepeno-y, salsa-y hot sauce that is awesomely awakening to the senses but you won't get if you don't ask!"}
{"text":"Used to come here in my early twenties and I'm not sure if my tastebuds are better or if this place has just not aged well. Went for a Saturday brunch just off-peak and the host literally ignored us while chatting with people at the bar despite tons of empty tables until another girl who had prompted him TWICE finally came over and got us settled. Food was the average breakfast plate, my poached eggs were actually soft boiled but nobody came asking us or even refilling our water jug at any point and we were really hungry so I just ate it. Maybe the guy who ignored us was supposed to be the one doing the rounds? Not sure what was going on there. There are lots of places that serve great brunch at the same price that have friendlier & more attentive staff so I think this place will just live in my memory for the better times."}
{"text":"As standup as Sunday brunch gets. Not too expensive. And our server was remarkably tolerant of two middle aged guys with a very active 4-year old."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast quesadilla with avocado, cheddar, and black beans. The food was pretty good and the service was fairly nice. It's a busy spot and I think the servers play a bit of a favourite's game with who they will pay attention to but it wasn't so discouraging to prevent me from wanting to go again. I'll try this place again and might even order a different type of quesadilla - it was really quite tasty :)"}
{"text":"I went for a late lunch at this place and I looooved it. My friend and I shared the ultimate grilled cheese and the fancy french toast (this weekend in particular it was strawberry and mango...so so so good) and we were absolutely not disappointed. I ordered an iced coffee as well and the lovely lady brought me a simple syrup on the side for sweetening if I wanted it! They also have a hot sauce that is so good (especially with the potato cubes or on the sandwich) that you can purchase for $5 in a jar. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place has a patio and is kind of cool. They have kitch cups for the coffee, mimosas, Caesars, hand crafted beer, vegan options, and nice decoration.  I ordered a rye bread sandwich with grilled pepper, mushrooms and hummus. Mateo asked for the sausage burger with a sunny side egg on the top (the prettiest and most perfect egg I've ever seen...), and I was glad he didn't ask for the waffle with meat that looked too joink...  In this joint you need to be patient and being with a chill brunch attitude, don't go if you are in a hurry.  I really liked how the plates looked when they came. Both included cubes of potatoes.  After a bite I realized they put cheese instead of hummus, fortunately I'm not a vegan yet, so I ate a half. Because the bread was way too greasy, I just opted to eat the insides of the 2nd half. I think the best part of my meal was the fresh salsa they gave with the perfectly cooked mushrooms of my sandwich.  My husband complained because even with his big mouth, he couldn't give his burger a good bite cuz the bread was really hard. I had a bite of the burger and it wasn't anything special.  I'm giving 2 stars instead of 3 because with the sun and at the patio, while sweating and eating we asked a lady for the beer menu. We finish eating with warm water, and when I realize we were done, a waiter came and Mateo asked for the check. But I felted I needed to tell him about the beer menu that never came... He just asked me: so? You want the beer now or just the check... Never mind, just the check..."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch told the server that I didn't have much time and asked for a recommendation as to what was quick. I chose the peep meal and egg sandwich Because I was told that the burger would take 15 minutes. 15 minutes later I got a cold peameal and egg sandwich"}
{"text":"to be honest i was disapointed.  after looking at the photos on yelp and seeing the display of food i thought it would be good but it was barely that.  i ordered the eggs benedict and it  was smeared in a generous over the top amount of tasteless hollandise sauce.  really really disapointed by the tastelessness of this dish even though its supposed to be savoury. and if you are not seated at the front of the restaurant its super ghetto in the back including the bathrooom.  the service was good attentive amd friendly.  the foodt didnt seem too overly vegan/gluten friendly to me even though it showed up on yelp that way..  all in all quite a medicore experience though the display of food was good the taste surely wasnt all that."}
{"text":"I mean, it's not a trip to Canada unless I'm eating poutine, right? So, naturally I had to have some gravy-covered, cheese-curd fries when in Toronto on my last trip. The Grapefruit Moon was about a half block from the venue where we were setting up, they offered to-go food, and they had poutine so it was kind of a no-brainer for me.  I got the Real Deal Poutine - a giant order for $9 and it was quite delicious. Since I took it to go I didn't have a ton of interaction with the staff, but the guy that took our order was super pleasant and our food was ready really quickly, even though it was an order for five people.  It definitely seemed a little cramped inside and I happened to be there on what was most like the hottest day in Toronto EVER so that wasn't really helping the situation.   Bonus: you can get pulled port added to your poutine if you are so inclined. Perhaps next time, Toronto...."}
{"text":"I watched the Restaurant Makeover episode featuring Grapefruit Moon and was a bit skeptical about going here, given how the chef allegedly changed everything back.  But I did make it out here once and it wasn't as bad as I thought it may be.  The sandwiches were good, not great but still solid, the place is funky and definitely has character.  The home fries (chips?) though were soggy and seemed like they would sink if thrown back in the oil.  Though I really liked how Grapefruit Moon looked at the reveal of it on TV, I definitely value it as a neighborhood joint and think it fills that niche just fine."}
{"text":"Another fantastic breakfast place in Toronto!  They have free wifi, which is awesome, and the servers will do what they can to help you out. The morning we came it was a pouring rain kind of day, so we had to scrap our plans of visiting Casa Loma. Our server recommended some alternative plans, one of which we used...the National Film Board, where you can watch personal screenings of Canadian films for free!   Anyways, onto to the food. I was debating between the huevos rancheros and Sunny's grilled cheese, but who could say no to a grilled cheese sandwich, especially when it comes with avocado? I also said yes to the tomato and skipped out on the onion. The grilled cheese on multi-grain bread was a great decision. I like my bread toasted to a nice crisp and they gave me the sandwich that way without me even asking! Avocado and tomato with cheese is a combination I normally don't associate, but now I do! My meal also came with some grilled potatoes, which taste excellent when you add in their homemade hot sauce. Yes, you heard right. Homemade hot sauce. There was more texture than I anticipated, sort of like a creamy ketchup, which was why I didn't know this was hot sauce initially. It is hot, but having that thick texture made it bearable. Definitely make sure to try that on something at least when you come by!"}
{"text":"This place is very close to my house. Been once for dinner and once for the brunch. Had the dinner a little while ago and don't remember too much about it, so I won't write too much about that. I seem to remember that the pints were very reasonably priced though.  Came here for brunch recently with a large group of friends. They were full up when we arrived as it was a Sunday morning, but they made sure we got a spot in line and came outside regularly to give us updates on the wait time. By the time we got seated we were ravenous, and they made sure we got our coffee right away!   It is fairly standard breakfast food with a few little gems. My friend had the corn cakes and they were quite good. The breakfast poutine looked like the best option, will probably get that next time. The great thing about this place is they serve brunch on weekends until 4.  The food is good, not outstanding, but definitely good. Portions weren't enormous but sufficient. It has a charming, laid back atmosphere. The coffee cups looked like the kind of eccentric mugs you'd find at a garage sale (in a delightful way). Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Generally been disappointed by their food. Seems like more of a place to have a drink than a place to eat."}
{"text":"Did not have a satisfying brunch experience here. Our group ordered the full moon breakfast and the vegan morning and portions for both items were way too small which is something I usually never complain about. Although the waitress was friendly, the service was really slow - it took 15-20 mins before our table was cleaned and water was provided and was at least another hour before our order came out for a group of 5. I also didn't enjoy the coffee as it was really watered down. The best part of the meal I would say were the potatoes that came with the full moon breakfast and the hot sauce provided with the meal.."}
{"text":"Super tasty breakfast, homey feel! Really enjoyed my Huevos Mexicanos and my man had a yummy Winston's Big Breakfast. Loved the kitschy coffee mugs and the home made hot sauce. We even bought one to go!"}
{"text":"This brunch spot is fantastic.  I was a little nervous going to place with great reviews based on weekend brunch on a Monday, but the food and service was awesome.  I especially liked their outdoor side seating.  We were pleasantly surprised by the welcoming interior of the restaurant and seating among other weekday brunchers outside.  The food leans on Mexican-esque dishes and affordable prices.  Glad the World of Yelp lead me to another great suggestion!"}
{"text":"Very super annoyed that I drove my family across town to go here and it was closed during hours that the website said it was open. People inside and no answer. I understand restraints keep different hours but at 2 pm when the site said it was open .... I won't bother again."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for comfort food and Grapefruit Moon delivers.   I've tried their sandwiches (Hoser, eh? and B.L.T), all day breakfast and fish and chips. Though not everything is out-of-this-world amazing, it's been very good.   They make really good espresso-based drinks and the hot chocolate is heart-warming, though not overly sweet.   The service is fabulous, and I've never felt pressured to speed up my conversation or meal.   +1 for unpretentious environment.  Vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"I finally made my way here for brunch one Sunday. Amazing French toast, nice Purple Moon cocktail, great service and a really great looking place. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"My first experience with Grapefruit Moon was love -- great service, great food -- overall, a great patio brunch. I felt like I had found a hidden gem in my neighbourhood! I had the \"Hoser, eh?\" and enjoyed every bit of it.   I went back recently and although I sympathize with the place being understaffed at the time, I did not appreciate: being served after diners who came in after me, overhearing the waitress complaining about having to serve people, and the rudeness I received when settling my bill.   Rethinking my love."}
{"text":"It's a cute neighbourhood spot, but the service is novice at best. Came for brunch on a sunny Sunday.  At the start it seemed a bit busy and chaotic. Waited in line for a table only to have the couple behind us seat themselves ahead of us. The hostess did not flinch.  Despite the large jug of water at the entrance of the patio, trying to get a glass is nearly impossible. Like the table next to me, we decided to help ourself. Every order was carried out by a confused server asking each table if it was theirs. 10 tables cannot be that hard to number.  The food was decent, the service was average. More like a greasy spoon for hipsters. Don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a Groupon.  They have a nice little patio and nice service.  The day we came there were a lot of flies and bees outside, which was kind of annoying - but obviously the restaurant had nothing to do with that.    I was a little disappoint that they didn't have any Mexican inspired brunch features.  That's originally why I wanted to come here b/c I saw them on Yelp awhile ago.    If I'm in the area I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The barista left us standing in the doorway until we finally asked if we could seat. The service was poor, the coffee looked like tea, half of our order was missing but still on the bill surprisingly. Looking around us, people were living the same bad experience, with missing ingredients in their plates or just having to struggle to find someone taking their order. Finally, when it was time to pay, the barista was suddenly very friendly, until she noticed the tips..."}
{"text":"I found Grapefruit Moon while looking for a brunch place that could provide awesome dishes to accommodate a vegan friend and my boyfriend who has a soy/nut allergy (surprisingly, not many places have a decent amount of options for both). Grapefruit Moon's menu fits the bill, with quite a few items that can be made vegan/are vegan. The inside is cute with whimsical looking decor.  I can't help but order the lumberjack breakfast when I go to a brunch place for the first time so I ordered the Big Bang ($14). Overall, it was pretty good, although the homefries were a bit on the bland side for me and my buttered toast came out soggy and cold -- I'd def order it dry if I return . My boyfriend ordered the French Toast ($12) and said it was good. They had an awesome hot sauce there that has apricots and pumpkin in it, as well as $6 mimosas from 9-4 on weekends. At my table no one raved about their food but no one had any complaints either.   I'd describe the service as OK. Once we were done eating, it took a noticeably long time for our plates to be cleared (for context, we weren't in a rush or anything and it still seemed long), and an even longer time for anyone to return only to ask if she could take our hot sauce away. We sat down at the tail end of the brunch/lunch rush however, by the time we were done eating the place had really emptied out so it seemed weird that we had to wait such a long time while we watched other tables being cleaned up.   I really wanted to like this place, but for the so-so service and kind of forgettable food, I'm giving Grapefruit Moon a 3."}
{"text":"I've come here for brunch for years. It's a reliable place to get a good moderately priced meal, with good ingredients, with a chill vibe. They have an amazing Ontario draft brew selection. Have to come back another time after the sun sets.   At any rate, this place is well known and accordingly packed on the weekends. Plan for a line. It's a tight squeeze, but not uncomfortable.   PS: The episode of Restaurant Make-Over at Grapefruit Moon is hilarious. No surprise they changed the place back  PS: I came back for dinner and had a Duggan's No.9 - my favorite stout in Ontario."}
{"text":"I thought it was time to update my review, as this little gem has undergone some recent changes. The new menu is lovely, interesting, with solid food options (vegan friendly too!), decent variety and some interesting new items on the menu. Cool cocktails, and really great Earl Grey tea lattes (I get it made with almond milk)! The other day I stopped in to grab a bite, and decided to try the new Morning Glory Breakfast Burger. OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've gotten used to other places pre-made, sub-par sausage patties - these ones are HUGE! Home made, juicy, tender, tasty! The burger is amazing. You should just RUN THERE NOW!!! Also, they have a well-organized shelf of board games (I especially like the Easy/Hard questions - always preparing for my Jeopardy debut), good music (never too loud, you can hear the person you're with) and always friendly owner and staff! Great kid's menu options as well. Solid, reliable and tasty!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! Went for brunch, and it was far better than any other brunch spot I've been to since moving to the Annex. Plus, they had HP sauce. That didn't hurt at all.   Also, here's the seemingly obligatory mention of their wicked hot sauce. It's wicked.  Looking forward to going back for dinner and pints. Are they open tonight?"}
{"text":"Always has been a favourite of mine and now that I'm living back in the neighbourhood it's so refreshing to be able to go back again. Their selection of craft beer is excellent and the new menu and renovations have breathed new life into the place. Friendly and warm customer service is always nice too! I'd highly recommend going there."}
{"text":"Ordered the eggs benedict, tea latte and french toast. It has a diner appeal to it with average food. For their tea latte they just out the tea bag in warm milk. Please don't put tea latte on your menu if you don't know how to make one. The service was decent."}
{"text":"I always question the mentality of a neighborhood when each of its denizens seems to carry the essence of it.  Isn't it wrong to be able to pinpoint the neighborhood from where this person or that person resides? Now, I have no problem with community, but I do have a problem when I feel I am being judged because I don't belong to it.  Grapefruit Moon is most definitely a community restaurant, being at the heart, and I mean the heart, of the Annex.  And even though I shave my armpits everyday, wash my hair at least once a week, and frequently get a pedicure, I still love the Huevos Rancheros at this brunch spot, is that so wrong?    It is not necessarily the staff that stir up my high school feelings of not belonging, but the restaurant's clientele, so let not my resentment get in the way of you enjoying a hearty, but not cheap, breakfast at this spot.  Expect a little somethin', somethin' on your  fork before you've used it and check your water glass for floaties before you have a sip.  Other than that the hot sauce is a must-have condiment , so make sure you ask for it when you receive your meal."}
{"text":"I honestly believe I had the best burger of my life today. Jarvis was very nice, even to the harsh curmudgeon next to us. Great fries, nice coffee, lovely salad dressing, and, as I said, the best burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"5 star food 3 star pricing 4 star service and ambiance   I had the breakfast burger. Super yummy. Hot sauce and hash browns were solid. $15 is about 15% over priced"}
{"text":"Very homey. Feels like you're in someone's sort of odd-indie kitchen. Very great brunch menu. I went there because it's 20 metres from my house and it looked really nice. I had the \"Fancy French toast\" which was sided with various exotic fruits, blueberries and maple syrup. I paired it with their VQA Sauvignon Blanc which was quite smooth and citrusy. Really paired with the fruit topped on the French toast."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant with good food. Had breakfast here; service is good and vibe is really cool. Depending on what you eat, it's not too expensive. Would go here again!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite small spots for burger.  A 30 second walk from home for local meat? I couldn't ask for anything better.    It's very burger, brunch kind of a place.  Don't be fooled by the outside. This place is far from hipsterishhh. It's really homely and inviting. Probably the only place I don't mind eating alone.  The place seats about 30 people during a rush so if you're coming with a large crowd and plan to sit inside, call ahead. There is a patio that was quite a lot of seating.   The employees are madd friendly and quite sophisticated in a way. They all seem to have interesting conversations and are quite inviting.   The atmosphere is quite and quite homely. Sometimes I come here to do my homework. Most times, I'm here for brunch and burgers."}
{"text":"so quiant, so romantic, so ideal for sunday.  Found out about this place by watching it get a makeover on t.v It was a block away from my house.  Went and fell in love with the bohemian vibe.   Cheap, friendly and cozy. How could you go wrong?"}
{"text":"my wife & i came here 3 times: first time was great, second time was OK, third time was pretty terrible. while the service each time left much to be desired, the food on our first visit at least made up for that...however, each subsequent visit felt like a downgrade. since we visited at such radically different times (late night dinner, early-afternoon brunch, mid-day early dinner), i can't be sure if the good, the bad or the ugly was their \"off-day\"..."}
{"text":"Falales are not made in house. Veggie burger is not made in house. The hummus though, is made in house. Vegetarian options are a bit of an afterthought/insult.  Tried the vegan philly cheese steak sandwich. While not necessarily bad, it in no way resembled an actual philly cheese steak sandwich in either appearance or taste. It was in a tortilla wrap and had a spicy tangy and sweet sauce and had red and yellow peppers and very few onions and a smidgen of vegan cheese. Better to call this a soy beef bbq wrap with peppers as that is more accurate.  Weak coffee. Good hummus. Good and friendly service."}
{"text":"VIBE  Grapefruit Moon (or GM) really feels like a neighbourhood hang. Lots of young friends hanging out here on a Saturday morning. In the front, there's lots of light streaming in from the windows and people lined up waiting to get a seat. But you won't wait too long. The decor is an eclectic mishmash of tchotkes and the dishware doesn't match -- all part of its charm. Service is friendly but no-nonsense. They're a wee busy!   WE ATE  My friend had the breakfast quesadilla - eggs, black beans, and cheese - full of flavour. It's hard for me to resist liking a quesadilla when I had a bite. I had the breakfast special of the brie and avocado grilled cheese. I love both of these foods and together they create a good texture but there was no flavour.  The homefries were spot on and salty, just the way I like it. I might go for the basic eggs and bacon if I come back.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  A grapefruit moon is not something you think of. It's odd and quirky. That's this place but it makes you feel cozy. A nice staple in the Annex."}
{"text":"First off what a \"story book\" name! The Grapefruit Moon! So yes was walking on Bathurst saw this charming name and stopped right in-front of it, I literarily couldn't move (-;  Charming interiors with, white painted brick walls being adorned by big mirrors and a guitar advertising their Lunartic Acoustic night every Monday nights.  I browsed through their menu and right away saw what I wanted! Vegan scrambler with gluten free bread, easy peasy, and the bartender behind the counter was sooooo friendly great vibes were all around!  The plate came, I took my first bite, and lord behold my vegan meal was actually, tasty, flavourful, and for $15.00 Devine!!! Also I kept on adding their house made sauce (jalapeños peppers, apricot , and more) Great price for a great meal, and ahhhmazing customer service!  Can't wait to return for their open mic night!"}
{"text":"Service: not so great. At one point one server seated a group of four people beside me but a different server came and made them get up to seat a different group of people who had apparently been waiting longer. I guess it's nice of that server to get the people waiting longer a table but I've never seen other people getting kicked out of their seats!  You apparently don't get your cheque brought to you at the end of your meal. You could probably just sit there for an hour after eating and no on will ask you to leave. Not really a good protocol to practice in a place that was steadily busy.  To pay, I think it's expected that you just go up to the counter to pay. FYI- you seat yourself on both the patio and indoors.  Venue: Horrible seating. There is one long bench along the indoor seating along which a number of single sized tables a are placed. These tables are moved together and apart according to group sizes. However, there were many awkward threesomes who seated themselves at a two person table (two on the bench, on on the chair across) . These poor people looked so squished! There is a patio but I didn't have a good look at it.   Food: Awesome. There are some very unique and healthy options on this small menu! I was debating between the egg burrito ($10) or the simple all-day breakfast ($6.50). I opted for the simple breakfast so I could try the veggie bacon ($2). My meal consisted of two eggs, two pieces of toast, home fries and the extra bacon I added. I enjoyed the home fries a good deal. They are actually more like roasted potatoes due to their large size format and they are topped with Cajun seasoning. I also ventured to try out what was in the bottle sitting at the table. To look at it you would have no idea what it is. It turns out to be a spicy chutney. It was delish but if you, like me, handle spice poorly, I recommend mixing it with your ketchup.   Bottom Line: This is a supper casual place to go for brunch with one other friend. A must try. Repeat business will ensue."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out this cute neighborhood institution for a long time. I went with my favorite work colleagues for Sunday brunch and we scored a great spot on the patio. But everything about the meal and service was mediocre. I ordered the breakfast quesadila which was on the greasy side and skimpy on fillings. My orange juice tasted exactly like tropicana even though it was advertised as freshly squeezed and cost $4. The waitress explained that it was not from concentrate and bought squeezed. How does that count for \"freshly squeezed\"? The false advertising left a less than fresh taste in my mouth. I enjoyed the cute setting, but overall the experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"Pretty cute place but cramped and packed during brunch hours, like most places. Food was not memorable, but a decent brunch joint! Only thing I remembered were their hot sauce! That made my meal hehe."}
{"text":"This was probably my third time coming here for breakfast. I know it's reasonably cheap, has great service and the food is pretty good.   My boyfriend and I are on a very restrictive 30 day diet, and we were difficult to say the least (the diet is called the Whole 30 - basically can't eat any sugar, grains or dairy).   Our server, Veronika, was outstanding. So kind and gracious with our million questions (\"does this have added sugar? Does that have grains?\"), always with a smile. She and the cook did everything they could to satisfy our diet and they succeeded.   We had very basic breakfasts - egg, some meat and potatoes - and they were delicious. What was best is their homemade hot sauce. Peppers, apricot, spices - makes for a deliciously sweet and satisfyingly spicy addition to your meal. We loved it so much, we bought a jar.   Thanks for accommodating us! We will be back when we can eat everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Visited this gem on a trip in from Ohio. Absolutely loved it! The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, and the had Vernors ginger ale a Detroit favorite!   They were jamming 80s classic hits, Michael Jackson, Prince, etc...  And the there was the food...FAB.U.LOUS! The Grilled Cheese was amazing, the Morning Poutine superb, and the Moon Breakfast (what we would call an \"Americano\" or Traditional) was perfect.   I can't wait to comeback!"}
{"text":"Great location, friendly staff. Incredible brunch menu with lots of vegan options. However, if you are a vegan there and order the vegan breakfast you have to ask for either dry toast or request vegan butter (not sure if they even have it). Ordered this and bit into the toast happily assuming that the entire meal would be vegan, but the toast was drenched in real butter.... Kind of disappointing and weird that they wouldn't take that into consideration but other than that it was a good meal."}
{"text":"Everyone's so damn crazy about the patio, but the sweet spots at moony are the tables in the window. The staff generally don't like me and I don't generally like them (I've been charged for coffee refills here before, and I frequently exclaim \"$12!? You're killing me here.\" I've also spent 6 straight hours at a table trying to learn calculus.) But, you know, there's something kind of comfortable about the little waltz of detachment we dance together.   Plus, the bathroom here is covered in cheerful little flyers and posters to the degree that it kind of substitutes for neighbourhood comraderie?    Foodwise: Their potatoes are too salty and if you drink more than two of your coffees you *will* turn into a dry leaf rattling along the pavement.  Eggs are eggs what do you want to know. They make a nice spicy relishy thing, and their veggie burger Totally Tastes Like Vegetables. If that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"mediocre at best and fairly overpriced. $13 for a veggie wrap (with refried beans which made it wayyyyy heavy) and a basic salad (if you call salad 4 plum tomatoes halved, a bunch of romaine mix and thick balsamic dressing).   would not return."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a cold, cold, COLD night, when I was starving to death. Coming to this restaurant when you're starving to death is not a good idea. I know, there were only two people running the place, it was crowded, blah, blah, blah.   BUT. I'm tired of going to restaurants and making excuses for people taking an hour to bring me my food. If I want to take my sweet time getting my food to me, I'll make it at home so I can screw it up a couple times and take four hours for it to come anywhere close to my belly.  Anyway, the food was OK. I got fish and chips which were pretty good, my friend had the vegan burrito which looked really good as well. If there's one thing I will give them, their hot sauce is SOO good. I don't know what's in it, I don't know why it's that weird colour, but it's delicious. Do not mix it with ketchup, though. Seems like a good idea -- is not.  The place is cute and staff were really nice. I might come back (brunch looked good!) but I'll eat a snack before I head over."}
{"text":"I arrived for breakfast at 8:50am on a Sunday** and although the business hours stated that they were open from 8 and the door was open, I was told that they in fact opened at 9 and I'd have to wait outside. So I stood there for 10 minutes and waited, already annoyed as it'd taken me an hour to traipse across town for this meal and the hours were wrong (couldn't verify this on the website as it's been \"COMING SOON\" since 2007. Weak.).   Food was OK but there were a lot of flies inside and that really killed my mood. I'm really wary of a place that has too many flies buzzing around as it's a sure sign of something rotting, somewhere, that they're thriving of off. It's kind of hard to \"enjoy\" your meal when there are a dozen winged insects swarming around your head. Also, crying babies. Not Grapefruit Moon's fault but still detracted from my meal enjoyment. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention there was a dog running around when I arrived.   Now that I live in the east end it's less likely that I'll make the trek to the Annex to go back to this place, especially since it's next to impossible to get a seat after 11am.  **I know, I know. There are so many things wrong with my opening statement. Yes, I was up before noon on a Sunday, and craving breakfast. And if you're wondering how the hell I got to GM at this hour, my answer is the Vomit Comet, because the subway doesn't start running till 9:30am on Sundays - UGH. Let me tell you, riding the comet at 8am on a Sunday is quite different than riding it at 4am on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"With friendly service and lots of veggie options, this used to be my go-to brunch and patio spot. But after the ownership changed about a year ago, it has completely fallen apart. The new menu is bad and significantly more expensive, while the service is often aloof at best and disastrous at worst. Expect to wait ages for menus, bills, meals and drinks. The last time I visited, I waited 15 minutes for the server to take our drink order, at which point she almost off-handedly informed us that they had zero beers (!) on tap that day, and only one tall-can option. And it took another 10 minutes from ordering to get that can. Yikes. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Brunch here is an intimate affair, you really sit with the people beside you.  There isn't a lot of space.  This in and of itself doesn't bother me.  It fits with the neighborhood feel; like small town meets hipster.     I liked the food but it wasn't special.  I had the eggs Benedict but it just didn't hold up to other options in the city. I was with someone who had the Half Moon breakfast which was good but fairly standard.  If there wasn't a wait or it wasn't so busy I would return with reduced expectations.  Given that isn' the case, I am unlikely to be back"}
{"text":"Fast forward 5 years.  I'm now updating my review.  As a mom, this time.  They have weekly specials.  For now, on Wednesdays, kids eat free. It's otherwise a reasonable $5 or less, for kids to join you to get a munch.  We arrived around 5:30 pm.  Parked near Palmerston X Follis Ave.  Otherwise, if you want to come by car, Bathurst street has city parking, or you could try your luck on another side street.  I had the (filling) beet salad ($11.25), hub had a cool, grapefruity Radner light beer, a burger.  Kids had chicken fingers, beef sliders, and a grilled cheese.  We, the adults, were happy with our meal choices.   Our kids switched around portions of their meal.  Which kind of worked out: none of the food went to waste.  The fries were tasty, though oily.  Skins were still on.  They tasted like fries made with real potatoes, not like the smooshy filling you can get at some places.    We felt comfortable there.  Alternative music was pleasing.  Even my 2 year old pointed out the music.  Twice.  We were lucky in getting an indoor spot, near the windows.  Some cushioned bench seating, fit for a semi-large family.  We did not need to ask for boosters.  Service was kind.  And of the right speed. Our server accommodated us when we requested a family pic, with a twist. She also let us use a cloth towel to help soak up some water that was spilled.  Yes, I would go again and also I would recommend this place to a friend.  Not sure if they would accommodate large groups here.  Worth asking about.  Mostly burgers, fries, grilled cheese, wrappy items here.  Diner food.  I don't know if more food options will be made in the future, but seems like they are offering tried and true winning meal options.  Quality over quantity.  Vegan-friendly.  Daiya cheese sandwiches.  Tofu scramble vegan breakfast.    They didn't have any dessert, but I count this as a plus!"}
{"text":"Grapefruit Moon definitely has a hype machine behind it that gives it too much street cred around town, but I still think this place is A-OK.  I popped in yesterday for a wrap and a cider and it did the trick. It was one of those cursed Toronto downpours, so their beloved patio was wetter than a whale, leaving me inside with the fruit flies. The crispy chicken wrap was very tasty and I heart their spicy mayo, but I really dislike their potato things. Potato things, that aren't fries, I deem cop-out sides.   This review sounds negative, but when the sun is shining this place is a solid three stars. Three cheers for my fave fruit's lunar namesake.   PEPPER POINTS for living up to their name and having lots of grapefruit-y things on the menu, like greyhounds and grapefruit mimosas."}
{"text":"Small chill space. You'll find lots of children and kids on Wednesdays and Sundays. We order burgers and a salad. Salad potions are big but burgers and fries can be eaten up pretty quick."}
