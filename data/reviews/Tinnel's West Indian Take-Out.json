{"text":"I don't know how this place is still in business. The staff are the worst. They are rude and have no people skills. Never going back here."}
{"text":"Best beef patties in the gta. If you want cocktail size you need to order them ahead of time"}
{"text":"Iv only had the curry goat and patties from. Here patties are a reasonable price food maybe not as much but the curry goat was okay... but a patty for sure."}
{"text":"This is an amazing little slice of Carribean food. I had the goat curry and the oxtail. They give you generous portions of  the meat and fill the box with rice. Its SO worth it.  The goat was tender and not gamey. My husband doesn't usually like  gamey meats but he loved it.  The oxtail was stewed til  it was fall of the bone and so juicy. It had just the right amount of spice.  My only regret is that I forgot to try the  patties so I gotta go back sometime to do that.  Its small tho with no sitting space so you gotta take out or eat standing at the side counter. And it does have parking nearby.   Overall really really enjoyed it and I'm itching to come back soon to try their patties."}
{"text":"I'm always ordering their  patties by the box. Unlike other patties, their filling is really good. I've seen the area downstairs where they make everything and I'll give you the green flag that it's clean and the food is made the way it's supposed to be. Tried the soups and they're pretty good too. But stop by and try the coco bread with the patty too!"}
{"text":"Patties great as always.   Brampton location may taste better idk if they all make them fresh on site or centrally; will update the next time I buy from B-Town  The manish was great  FYI   Thursday Friday - Manish Sat Sun - Red Pea Soup"}
{"text":"Best patties i have ever eaten! Lots of meat and little dough I always vouch for the spicy beef. I usually buy 3 boxes plus because i never am around the area. These are the best flavour. I have tried vegetable, chicken, and regular beef i don't recommend any of these ones i only recommend the spicy beef one. The place is a take away place and its very busy during lunch hours so be forewarned!"}
{"text":"I've never had beef patties this good! Just so light and flaky and the filling is so good, creamy almost. Place gets a little packed and loud at times, but for $1.25 a patty it's totally worth it.   Also the \"spicy\" beef patty isn't that spicy, feel free to add some hot sauce to kick it up a notch."}
{"text":"This review and rating is based solely on their beef patties.  Tinnel's is a chain (according to the patty box they gave me).  The Beef patties are $12 for a dozen, and only come spiced HOT.  The hot is pretty hot, but not as hot as Randy's patties.  I rank these patties in my top 2, along with Randy's.  The flaky pastry is what makes a god patty for me."}
{"text":"Their spicy beef patties are AMAZING!!! They have a couple locations: in Rexdale; Albion and Finch, in Brampton; Kennedy and Queen and I think in North York as well. Definitely worth a try; they are delicious."}
{"text":"Very good patty. Very authentic. Economical lunch. Staff needs to be more friendly. They also do cocktail patties to order. The last time I was there they only accepted cash. Maybe it has changed since."}
{"text":"These patties are really good--better than any I've had in South Florida. Like a Tastee patty, Tinnel's patties are slim, and are filled with a beefy paste of similar consistency. They're the closest you'll get to a Tastee patty, outside of Kingston, Jamaica."}
{"text":"This is one of my few precious go-to places for a good spicy beef patty. We buy them uncooked in a box, put them in the freezer at home, and bake one up for a hearty breakfast/brunch/lunch item. Prices are good and they will even give you the separate paper baggies to put your individual patty in when you do cook it. So thoughtful and an awesome idea! Will keep coming back!"}
