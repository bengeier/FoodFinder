{"text":"The best deal when compared to the other AYCE Sushi Buffet in the neighbourhood. It includes Sashmi in the lunch menu. Have eaten at the restaurant many times.  The only dishes I did not enjoy were the thai dishes, rather have them at a Thai restaurant. During busy times, customer service can be slow, otherwise, they are normally very fast in bringing the food to the table."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. Very unpleasant people. They didn't greet us. Simply pointed to a table. They don't have an actual menu for all you can eat sushi lunch. Food wasn't stunning. There were flies in the restaurant that were buzzing around the food. Wasn't impressed at all."}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss, depending on who is making the sushi and who is in the kitchen. The last few times the sushi has been mediocre, both in taste and preparation. Calling in a take out order has been frustrating - half the time the order is wrong. The new online order process is clunky at best. For my money I'd rather go to Mye2, just down the street."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place whenever I crave sushi and sashimi. It has not disappoint me for the last 5+ years.   You definitely get a bang for your buck when you do the AYCE lunch since sashimi is on the lunch menu. Their salmon sashimi is one of the freshest and slimiest out there and the mango flash rolls are delicious especially when the mangoes are ripe.   TIP: Always pay with cash and you'll get a 10% discount. Don't order too much sashimi in the first round, it's usually frowned upon at relatively cheaper AYCE restaurants.   There are a few downsides here. You can't order shrimp tempura on it's own for lunch (it comes with two pieces of mystery deep fried veggies). They are somewhat understaffed at times and the location is small so during peak times, you may not get a seat right away. And for you iced tea lovers out there, it is not part of the all you can drink menu. Overall, it is still a good AYCE sushi place if you love sushi and sashimi!"}
{"text":"Favourite place to eat at!  I go as much as I can!  The food is nice and warm when I get it and tastes delicious. Great pricing for an AYCE."}
{"text":"Just finished a delicious meal with my visiting sister and her family. My niece's favourite dish was the tempura shrimp. Yummy.   At this visit, we were treated to two complimentary dishes: crab legs and mango pudding.   Friendly staff and large selection."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery twice now and will most likely do so in the future! Very fresh sushi."}
{"text":"This is my #1 go to spot for an AYCE sushi lunch. $14.99 per person during weekdays. On holidays and weekends, $15.99. The only bad thing is that Sushi Hour is located in Oakville, a bit of a drive for me.   They offer salmon sashimi in their lunch AYCE menu. Their maki rolls aren't jammed with rice and their food is fresh. If you pay cash, you get 10% off your bill. Canned soft drinks are included.   I've also been there for dinner, and it's also great. For the price difference, I prefer to go for lunch though.   My usual favorites are salmon sashimi, excellent roll and avocado salad. Though you can't go wrong with their food overall. They are consistent with quality as well.   I rate it 4.5/5 for their lunch AYCE and 4/5 for dinner. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and was impressed that I could get sashimi and pop with the meal. And as others say the discount for cash is great. Very quick with the orders. I was more impressed with the green dragon roll and the salmon/red snapper/tuna sushi than other ayce in oakville (August 8). I wouldn't bother with the sashimi again except for maybe the salmon. I found the miso to be like what you would get at any sushi place, pretty good. So I would return here if I had an ayce craving over other places in the area, though still can't give more than 3 stars - don't know if I will ever find an ayce that does though."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer,  until the last time I ate there.  When I walked in, I saw the waitress wipe the table using the previous customers dirty drinking water...spreading germs?  Next, she actually put my food on someone else's table, and then went back to get it and serve it to me!  She even gave me attitude when I said I didn't want food that was on someone else's table.  My friend went to use the facilities and wouldn't because it was so filthy.   I will be finding a different sushi restaurant to spend my money in."}
{"text":"Have been trying to find a good sushi place in the area after moving to Oakville a year ago. Was excited to come across Sushi Hour as it looked like a popular place. Unfortunately for us it was just meh...have had much better sushi in Vaughan where we use to live before. I guess for the west gta...it's as best as it gets?!"}
{"text":"We tried a bit of everything this time. Though toddler decide beef udon was her favorite.  Again the soya sauce was horrible, they have the green capped bottle which was supposed to be less salt but it was the exactly the same as red bottle.  I was stuck to chicken skewers ordered a dozen just for myself. Sashimi were great, sliced very thin just right if you use your chopsticks to pick up two at a time."}
{"text":"I like this place. Not the best, but good for the price. Pay in cash to get a discount. Sometimes you have to wait for a table. Service is not the best. They could improve."}
{"text":"I often order sushi when I'm in Oakville, and Sushi Hour is one of my favorites for the thick pieces of sashimi and delicious rolls.  I don't love the $25 minimum for delivery, but the food is always fresh and high quality.  Unfortunately, delivery took almost an hour the first time I ordered; tonight, it was just 30 minutes, so perhaps they're improving speed of delivery."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and I will not be going back. One star for the 50% off coupon for the 2nd person. There were 2 waitresses who avoided seating us so finally the sushi chef yelled at us to sit anywhere. The 2 waitresses then went into hiding and did not come by for a while. When they took our order, we asked for another place setting and more napkins and the waitress walked away while my wife was still talking to her. Microwaved fried rice showed up almost too fast, and same thing with the agedashi tofu. The food itself was average but unfortunately did not include dim sum items as many all you can eat sushi places now offer. One waitress spilled teriyaki sauce all over the table. It took a long time for our dishes to be cleared so we made a point of it by stacking them almost a foot high. Things were so slow after receiving our food that we asked for the bill when we ordered dessert. The end."}
{"text":"Favourite sushi place in town, hands down, whether I get take out or dine in. As a sashimi lover, the salmon is wonderful, tender and fresh. Hand rolls and maki always have a great portion of main ingredients, rather than being mainly rice.   Service is always polite and kind, even if there is a more informal feel, which I kind of love. Come as you are and make yourself at home!"}
{"text":"Good food and all can order as much sushi as you want if your can finish it. Pop is included too"}
{"text":"Had lunch there from their a la carte menu, awful. Their spicy salmon roll had almost no salmon in it, just tempura. I asked them to give me a regular salmon roll instead and they refused. These people don't know how to take care of their customers and they don't deserve to stay in business."}
{"text":"The price is amazing, but it comes at the cost of lower quality ingredients and perhaps fish that is not quite freah. Not something to tamper with when you're dealing with raw ingredients.   The lunch AYCE is an astounding 16$ for lunch. Cheaper by a bit of you throw down cash. It is unbelievable they can put sashimi out for this price.   Then the sashimi actually comes out, and it is all wrong. Small and thin slices around 2x1cm x 0.5cm thick. Tiny. Texture is leaning towards mushy, not firm. Taste and smells okay. I didn't get sick.   The rolls are nicely done, except the firehouse roll is a strange one with fried banana inside. Quite filling. Not good on the palate if you'll be sticking with sashimi. Flavour lingers in your mouth. Very filling also. Ask what is in these mysterious rolls before you order.   Worse part is that none of the cooked food is palatable. The fried items are greasy and heavy. To add, the frier smells of banana since they also fry the bananas in there. Not a good aroma for some lighter items like the tempura.   I would recommend against ordering any of the soup noodles or fried* noodles. Tasteless and bland soups are just boiled noodles and boiled bland seafood. The fried* noodles are NOT fried. It is a stir fry of boiled noodles and seafood with a touch of soy sauce, which is just disgusting.   Stick to the sashimi and rolls you know if you do decide to give this place a try.   If you have money to spare, for a few dollars more, pay for one of the quality AYCE just across the 403 on Dundas (168, Yi's).  If you want real quality sushi (quality not quantity), go to Dai Ichi sushi. That's my go to."}
{"text":"My favourite All You Can Eat Sushi restaurant!  I go here almost every other weekend for lunch.  At only $14.99 and offering sashimi at lunch, it's the best deal I've found so far.  The place is clean and beautifully decorated.  The only drawback is it's size.  If you don't get there when it opens, you should probably wait 1.5 hours to get in for the next seating.  The food is delish!  (I'm talking about the maki and sashimi.)  I never order hand rolls, so I can't comment on those.  Their pork cutlet on rice is very tasty, but it takes a little while to prepare, so if you want it, make sure you order it first as it takes 15 minutes.  The presentation of the food is beautiful, too!  We ordered a large amount of sashimi and they presented it beautifully (I'll have to dig up my photo to post on here).  They also offer drinks inclusive.  They give you canned pop, and yes, it's REAL Coke, not the fake cola and not from a fountain.  Unfortunately Iced Tea is no longer included.  The service is usually very good.  I haven't had bad service yet, but others have complained before.  For me, this is THE AYCE sushi place for me.  Even my friends from the east end are willing to drive down to the west end for sushi... and I guess for me, too!  (I'm giving this place 5 stars because I think everyone should give it a try!)"}
{"text":"Love this place. But it's been closed for a month. A sign in the window says \"Under Renovation\" but there is no indication if or when it will reopen. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to ayce sushi in Oakville. Their sashimi is fresh and tasty. Their portions are always done well. Not too heavy handed on the rice, unlike some other ayce sushi spots out there. Their kitchen items are also very good...(chicken kaarage ARE A MUST HAVE). Overall one of my more favourite ayce sushi joints out there."}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time with my boyfriend during lunch, as they had a wide variety of options and free pop refills. However, my most recent trip wasn't so pleasant. They completely changed their lunch menu by cutting the selection right in half. Hardly anything good to choose from. Not to mention, as soon as I paid for my meal (and left and overly generous tip), my boyfriend and I grabbed our half full pop cans to take to finish on our way home, and the waitress literally ran up and blocked our way out, demanding we leave our drinks. Excuse me? I already paid. That really aggravated me. However, a perk is that they offer sashimi for lunch, which many AYCE places don't do."}
{"text":"We love this place and order from it all the time. Prices are ok and food is great!!! Highly recommend the beef fried rice!!! Sooooooo good!! Delivery driver is so nice you almost want to invite him in for a bite..."}
{"text":"Disappointed with my most recent visit. The waitress who served me looked tired and miserable. I went for the all you can eat lunch special and the only good thing that came out of the food I ordered was the maki roll - which they made to my taste with only cucumbers and crab.  The beef udon noodles were way overcooked. They were ridiculously soggy and swimming in watered down teriyaki sauce.  The white rice was mushy and not as fluffy as I had remembered it to be. It was more of a paste texture than a steamed rice texture and some of the rice grains were squished against the side of the bowl.  I will not be going back there again, which is really unfortunate because I live in Joshua Creek - 10 minute walk behind them."}
{"text":"For what you pay, a decent place for ayce sushi. Service is attentive, but food comes out slow. My husband and I had a laugh that our tempura (steaming hot) came out before our sashimi. I was convinced they were fishing out back for the freshest salmon and octopus.  The ayce menu is smaller than most and there aren't many \"special\" rolls, but what they do have is good and fresh. The short ribs were well seasoned, the tempura nicely battered, the sushi cut to a good protein to rice ratio, yet I cannot give this place a higher rating.   For those who like \"sushi to go\", they do take out orders. We probably saw them process 30 take out orders in the hour and half we sat there. Definitely seemed like a popular option for a Friday night dinner. Will definitely give it a try next time we decide not to go to the ayce route."}
{"text":"A bit understaffed, not the best music (seems to play those weird smooth jazz cover of popular songs throughout the 70's to early 90's that EVERY sushi place plays) and the lack of seaweed salad was a little disappointing. Otherwise, I'm thoroughly impressed. The sashimi tasted fresh and delicious, everything was brought out of the kitchen at a rapid-fire rate (my favourite item being the chicken karaage) and the staff were all quite friendly."}
{"text":"This is a nice small sushi place.  The sushi is on par with the Japanese Buffet Sushi at Dundas & Erin Mills by the Miga Korean place.  Some of it is actually better!!  They have standard fare including miso soup, edamame, gyoza, etc.  They have items such as grilled squid not found on the other buffet sushi place.  The grilled salmon head is delicious and actually grilled and not deep fried like the other place.  Service is fast.  Place is small and seems to be popular. It is often filled with large groups and families.  Tempura is ok although not as light and fluffy a batter as other places.  Sashimi is fresh and tastes fine.  The spider maki has been cold the 2 or 3 times we ordered it.  The other rolls we tried were fine.  Good value for the price.  They used to have a nice discount if you paid cash but that stopped a few months ago."}
{"text":"The AYCE menu is alright. I've been here several times and the food is quite consistent. I usually have sashimi, maki rolls, grilled squid and enoki mushroom wrapped with beef."}
{"text":"Just about the worst service ever. We took a good 10 min trying to flag someone down to give them our order. The waitresses were just standing there chatting with the kitchen staff and laughing the whole time."}
{"text":"Small and cozy place. I'm very impressed to have sashimi for AYCE for lunch. And yes pay with cash u get 10% discount. Best sushi place in Oakville!"}
{"text":"We love coming to this place because this Is the only place that serves sashimi for lunch AYCE that we frequent.  Family loves the food here and the price is decent.  Food tastes good.  Service is great! If we have to  get our cream cheese wanton and short rib fix then we have to come for dinner."}
{"text":"Don't know why this sushi place has good reviews. The waitress was really sad and unwelcoming. Sushi was not that great. Mango salad was a shame. No green or red curry as it's a full sushi place and not a Thai place like others. But the fried rice was good. Will not recommend"}
{"text":"Called to make a reservation about five times during the day- there was no answer or no answering machine. Drove 20 minutes to go for dinner at sushi hour - only to find the restaurant closed. Very annoying for a loyal customer. No way to contact management via email or to leave a message on the phone. As a result I ended up going to spoon or fork - it was awesome and I probably won't be going back to sushi hour because of this."}
{"text":"I have been to many great AYCE restaurants and unfortunately, this is not a great one. The food at this restaurant is mediocre and the service could be better. The restaurant decor is nice and clean. The restaurant does have potential do become better. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone with families."}
{"text":"Worst sushi place ever!!! They have the worst customer service. We were still eating our food and lady came to our table and said very insultingly that you have to finish your rice or you will be charged. This has never happened to us. Pathetic place. No one should waste their money here. There are a lot of good sushi places like kb sushi, august8 with great food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Not expensive for AYCE lunch since sashimi's included. Sashimi are fresh but really small so better order more slices. On hot food, taste is not bad but there were not a lot of variety on the menu. Pop is not included, there's $1 extra charge.   Food initially came out timely but on the next round, we have to follow up. Service is good.  Place is small so if you are going with a large group, I suggest to call for reservation."}
{"text":"2.5*, bumped up 'cause they serve sashimi for lunch, include canned pop, AND they offer 15% off if you pay in cash.  For any reviewers who state that this place is \"authentic\", it's not.  I don't think any self-respecting Japanese person would run an AYCE.  This place is run by Mainlanders or at least Mandarin-speakers.    The initial waitress who received us by the door looked unhappy and her communication wasn't clear.  She muttered and as soon as she found out there wasn't a table available for us, she give us an order sheet so we could start ordering as we stood by the door.  I understood her mentality, but it made me feel rushed...even before we were seated.  Food was pretty mediocre.  Fish was relatively fresh, BUT it was tasteless and a bit watery.  Rice was not seasoned.  Handrolls had waaay too much rice.  Agedashi was also wet in the middle.  I don't think seaweed was the best quality 'cause it wasn't crunchy or tasty.  Miso soup was watered down, probably the worst thing on the table.  Tea tasted different both times.  Despite this, there was a bit of attention paid to presentation, so it wasn't a total write-off.  They forgot to bring one of our salads, but I didn't care 'cause I was already stuffed.   Menu wasn't super extensive as it is in other AYCE places, re:  no dim sum, no fries/chicken wings, only ice cream for lunch dessert.  Tip:  If you are planning to visit, reservations would probably be best 'cause the restaurant itself is on the small side.  Seems like a popular place amongst the Oakvillers!"}
{"text":"It's OK at best.  Went only during lunch and the menu wasn't as vast as us gta folks have come used to. They did have a good amount of sushi on their menu but the other categories lacked,  especially dessert.  Yes I was full but I left feeling I wanted more.    I really disliked the fact that you cannot order shrimp tempura on its own, you get 2 pieces of veg with it.  That being said I think canned drinks were included but not sure as I only had water.    Will be back only because of its location to my residence but there are far better sushi places near by."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  I have always gone for the all you can eat.   Good quality is good, flavour is good.  My only issue is that if you order soup and spring rolls, etc along with main dishes, you don't necessarily get them in order of appetizer, main, etc.    Will surely be back to this place."}
{"text":"Highlights: sashimi included on the AYCE menu; has all three flavours of the \"Asian Neapolitan\" ice cream (i.e. green tea, red bean, mango), sushi tastes fresh; dishes come well plated presentation-wise; service is relatively quick; excellent specialty rolls, well put-together and portioned appetizers; decent tempura  Things that need improvement: hot green tea is often burnt (steeped at too high a temperature); handrolls come with too much rice some times  Things to order/personal favourites: any of the dragon rolls (the Excellent dragon roll is highly recommended), mango flash roll, dynamite roll, eel avocado roll (or handroll), spicy salmon or spicy tuna rolls, salmon nigiri, yakitori  Bring cash."}
{"text":"Our family loves sushi. This place is convenient and reasonably priced. The food is hit and miss though. Sometimes it tastes fresh and good, sometimes it tastes old and a bit funny. On most recent visit, they brought out cold shrimp tempura. The wait staff never looks happy but will get you what you need as long as you flag them down."}
{"text":"Disappointing service - we were seated for 10 minutes before we were acknowledged - and only got service because we waived them down. Six staff were talking amongst themselves at the sushi bar at the time so it's not as if they were busy. Food was bland. Same sauce on everything.  Even when they delivered the food it was kind of thrown on the table by the waitstaff as he continued his conversation with his colleagues. Uncomfortable setting, food was mediocre at best. Never returning. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"We did a la carte and found the sushi very mediocre tasting. The spicy salmon roll had too much tempura inside with very little salmon. As well, the salmon on the salmon sushi did not taste very fresh. Don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Sushi is ok the selection isn't as big but still decent for a neighbourhood sushi place. Although I got food poisoning here about 2 years ago so u hope they cleaned it up a bit. I would probably travel up Dundas for better sushi for the same price point."}
{"text":"Was invited to this restaurant a couple days ago for a birthday party and the place was very clean and had really comfortable seating. Food was pretty good too, I always order the Dragon Roll and I had better but it was still pretty good. But the unbeatable part was the price, all you can eat lunch for only $14.99.- and if you pay cash you get a 15% discount!! I have never seen such a low price for all you can eat sushi. Plus it's not like all the other places that u can't have sashimi or the fancy rolls like Dragon Roll for lunch. It's all available!!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to try out a new AYCE sushi restaurant that was somewhat close to Milton. I opened up my Yelp app and it led us to Sushi Hour.  We arrived at 7 pm which was right before the dinner rush. There must be a high school around this area because there were several loud annoying students when we were there. I even snap chatted a teen sleeping lol. I immediately noticed that the floor really needed to be swept. The uncleanliness of the floor turned me off. Luckily the service and sushi made up for it.  The AYCE menu isn't as extensive compared to other AYCE sushi restaurants. But there's enough to choose from. Our orders came out VERY quick. We were actually surprised at how fast everything came out. The sashimi tasted fresh and the rolls were delicious. I really liked the spider rolls!  Overall, we had a pretty good first experience at Sushi Hour and would recommend it to others.  PS: If you pay cash they give you a 10% off discount!  PPS: Drinks are included!"}
