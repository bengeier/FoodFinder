{"text":"It took almost a hour to get French toast and eggs served, the portions were so tiny, and the prices outrageously expensive. The food was ok, the service was very good at least."}
{"text":"good food, fast service...diner with homestyle meal"}
{"text":"Eaten there several times.  Food has always been good large portions and good service"}
{"text":"One of our favorite local places to take friends and family for a good solid southern meal. Good food, great prices, sweet waitresses who always remember us!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Fort Mill Family Restaurant since it opened 3 years ago. The owner and his wife are great! Always enjoy talking with them and the servers. I love they serve breakfast til late in day! The club and taco salad are my favorite for lunch. Resonable prices and lots to choose from at this family owned business."}
{"text":"Great food! You must try the prime rib (offered Friday and Saturday nights) and their beef stroganoff (best I've ever had). The owner really cares about your experience there and strives to offer amazing food with a great environment at great prices. A friend recommended this place to me and I'm glad he did!"}
{"text":"Great local spot! I love their coffee and breakfast! Friendly staff. I will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is a hidden gem, located in the Food Lion shopping center.  Reasonably priced, and really good food.

I go to Fort Mill fairly often for business and I always make a point to swing by here for lunch.  I haven't had breakfast or dinner here yet, so I can't comment on that, but if it is anything like their lunch offerings, then it's got to be good.

The steak and cheese sandwich is amazing - I always want to try something new, but I find myself constantly getting this.  The steak tips are amazing too."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Everything was great we had breakfast and it was wonderful. My family doesn't go out much but I didn't regret eating here."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast. It wasn't anything extraordinary just simple breakfast. It was served fast and as ordered so that's always a plus!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast choice. I've been here two separate times and both meals were very good. Hot food served promptly at a reasonable price. What more could you want in a breakfast place? Good coffee too!"}
{"text":"Ive ate here twice for breakfast and about 4times for lunch. Food is great and prices are good. Great chef salads, BLT, chicken salad plate, great sides, breakfast and sweet tea. I love when I work in the area and can eat here. Great little diner."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Love the people and the food - everything is really made from scratch (except for a few things like hot sauce lol). I've eaten here a few times; every time I try something different, and every time I come away happy. 

The family is originally from upstate NY and were raised in Greek restaurants, so they know their stuff. Garbage plates, prime rib, fresh-made salads, it's all good. I haven't had the Italian dishes but haven't seen the need - why bother with that when there are so many other fantastic options?

This isn't a hoity-toity place, it's a down-home diner that gives you great food (both quality and quantity) for your money. Love it!"}
{"text":"My first time and we walked out without even being offered a drink.  Shameful service.   The group of 6 who were seated after us had their drinks ordered and delivered within 3 minutes.  Waste of time.  We were even seated right by the cash register!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here for breakfast after church almost every Sunday and absolutely love it! The service is fantastic and the prices are reasonable! I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was amazing, very attentive and they had coloring material for our daughter upon request. The marinated chicken tips were seasoned nicely and the mashed potatoes were yummy with the brown gravy. Their fried okra was very good I'm glad I had chose that as a side.  As for the country fried chicken steak, the breading was flavorless and hard to chew and cut. The white gravy that came along with it needed more salt and pepper to make it country gravy. Would not recommend them. The collards were overly salty and the broccoli was unseasoned. This seems like a great place for my grandparents to come ( bland or overly salted food) but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Check open hours first! This is a very good (and one of very few in this area) southern style restaurants, locally owned. Dessert are amazing! Food is delicious and service is prompt and courteous. Just check the open times bc I've driven here and was disappointed to see they weren't open :("}
{"text":"This is nice little hidden gem. Great family restaurant where they really know everybody's name. It's so nice to see the waitress call many people by name and they came in. I could tell they have been enjoying that establishment for years. The food was delicious and we will definitely be returning. It's a little older looking but don't let that fool you. We are breakfast today but we will be back to try dinner for sure."}
{"text":"The food is alright and a comfortable setting. I like to come in here from time to time."}
{"text":"This place just never seems to quite be as good as you want it to be. I have a big problem with their portion sizes. The country style steak is always two little pieces. The side portion sizes are quite small too. The fried squash is usually four or five pieces. The fried items always taste like they are cooked in. old deep fryer oil. I so want to support local restaurants and stay away from chains, but experiences like I always seen to have here make me long for the consistency of the big chain restaurants"}
{"text":"Owner operated family restaurant in Fort Mill makes this a great choice for breakfast. Generous portions, friendly staff and reasonable prices makes FMFR a great choice! Try the breakfast special, you won't be disappointed......."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and was very pleased with the food and service.  I've seen the restaurant always open and decided to take the family in for dinner.  We all left full and happy. Will make a next trip for breakfast."}
{"text":"We have lived in Fort Mill for 20 years and many places have come and gone here. Lets just say we want this one to stay. While the decorum inside is lacking in style, the food is worth it. I gave it 5 stars because the service is always great and when the food comes out it is shockingly great. Almost like it should be a really nice restaurant. Pricing is also cheap for the quality you get. We will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast. Worth the wait! Friendly staff, excellent food and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and everything was great, so we went back for the Prime Rib dinner and it was wonderful. 

The owner was very nice and talked to us. Friendly people and I will diffinatly be going back."}
{"text":"This is a good old-fashioned Greek-owned diner.  Most of the food is decent but definitely not outstanding. It is convenient and most of the menu is cheap. I have had diner staples such as beef tips, hamburger steak, and fried shrimp. If you live nearby, it is a great option. They serve breakfast all day which is nice.  The one \"must get\" on the menu is the pickled beets side.  It is hard to describe but is flavorful. The owners are also very nice and helpful.

It is a diner so if you have been to some of the meat and three places in Charlotte, you know what to expect. It is not 5 star restaurant food, but it is good, comfort food from a locally-owned placed."}
{"text":"Our go to breakfast place!  Friendly service and good fried potatoes. They remember you when you visit which is a plus.  The hostess is a doll and the owners are very nice."}
{"text":"We stopped for brunch on a Sunday around 11 am. Local family owned business. Quick friendly server. Had the pancake, eggs, bacon combo and my love had sausage biscuits and eggs. Food was out fresh from the grill, before we could finish our first cup of coffee. Attentive staff that help each other. This is the place to go for a good meal at a reasonable price. We will be back."}
{"text":"Good and simple breakfast with southern hospitality.  Diners are hard to come by in the Fort Mill Area, glad to know I found one which I will become a regular.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"Ok I'll admit I enjoy breakfast so much that I'll drive long distances to have a great experience.  That's exactly what I got here at Fort Mill Family Restaurant.  It was raining pretty hard on this Sunday morning when I strolled into the front door.  I was greeted within 10 seconds of entering and asked how many was in my party.  

This was my first time here so I have to ensure that their system is able to accept my payment and theirs was able to read it just fine although they were under the impression that all mobile payments wouldn't work with their \"new\" system.  It shows when businesses are willing to adapt to new technologies and I would do everything in my power to support such business.  This is probably the only reason they didn't get a full 5 stars is because they really should contact the company that installed and support their point of sale system and their merchant to have an NFC reader to allow all mobile payments.  I say this because not everyone has a Samsung Galaxy S6 or newer (the only phones that will work for payment here for the time being).  I talked to the managers and they told me they used to have an NFC and chip reader that worked for all mobile payments but was removed when they upgraded.  I'm sorry to tell you but when you upgrade you don't want to go backwards.  I'd be glad to help you talk with your point of sale provider and/or merchant support to make this a reality.  

For the atmosphere it was warm and inviting.  The decor was normal not too flashy not too dingy.  They had a bunch of ceiling fans so I'm assuming during the summer you can stay cool!
I only saw one TV in a corner with the news on they would do better with a couple more in there.  The bathrooms were fairly clean but the men's restroom has a broken handle on the toilet and the paper towels were out.  They use an on demand water heater so it heated quickly and I don't know why I mention that but something I look for is hot water in the restrooms.

The service here was great from start to finish.  Everyone I came in contact was friendly and eager to help.  It's refreshing when people work as a team and it shows!  You don't want to be a place that has sections and they get into a mentality of \"it's not my problem.\" I say this because I can drink some sweet tea fast and multiple people came to check on me and refilled me each time.  It means a lot to me when everyone on staff speaks to guests and are polite.  The biggest impact on today's visit was multiple people asking for me to return and simply saying \"I hope you come back to see us again soon\" and thanking them for showing them something new.  

I will be back now that I found them! I love LOCAL business :)"}
{"text":"The food is good. We go there for breakfast .. But the guy who owns it is RUDE! Not a good place to take your kids, he doesn't have patience for them."}
{"text":"(7/8/17) I was early to see a clint in the area and I told her that I would stop and have breakfast somewhere before heading over to her house. I had read reviews of this restaurant on Yelp and it looked interesting. It was pretty close to where I had pulled over to talk to the client so I backtracked a bit & parked in the lot. I was seated right away in a four person both. It was pretty crowded and everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals. I ordered a  Mediterranean omelet with a side of toast, corned beef hash & grits. It took about 10 minutes for my meal to arrive and I ate everything down to the plate or bowl. Nothing was spectacular but combined it was very hearty & filling."}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome! The Mediterranean omelette was so good & the perfect size! Home fries & grits are both great too! Service was excellent! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice diner in Fort Mill. Nicely decorated and looked very clean. Our server was very friendly and gave great service. We had breakfast for dinner and it was delicious - lots of grits (which we love!)
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I coordinate a monthly luncheon group and love to try places that members from my group suggest. I called Fort Mill Family Restaurant and asked if they could accommodate a large group of 20+ and they said yes. I called the morning of to confirm the number and they said all was in place. My group of 24 arrived at noon. Beverages were poured but no orders were taken till after 12:20. We waited for our food to arrive as tables around us that were seated after us received their food, paid their bill and left. I asked when our food was coming at 12:50 and a waitress said just a few minutes. At 1:00 I asked for the manager. Instead of apologizing for the delay, she stated that one of the cooks didn't show and that there were other large parties taking up their time. I was disappointed in her response and said so. Our food started to arrive at 1:05. By 1:20 almost all the meals had been served except for one. She had ordered shrimp and pasta which shouldn't have been a time intensive dish. I inquired about it and a few minutes later it finally arrived. 
My group said the food was fine with generous portions. My wings were mediocre and my mom's omelette was made with cheese wiz which she ate only because she was so hungry.
Acknowledging the delay in food would have gone a long way. Providing some crackers to nibble on would have been good. Unfortunately the only one who apologized was the waitress Apryl who ran the register.
I will not be bringing my lunch group back."}
{"text":"Have eaten both lunch and breakfast here in the past year.  

It's roomy with plenty of tables and a diner feel.  The staff is courteous and check in with you at decent intervals.  The breakfast menu is standard southern breakfast fare with nothing to make it stand out from a number of other diners in the area.  I had the Farmhouse omelet with grits and a side of sausage.  It tasted fine, would have preferred real cheese to the American slice but it was ok.  

The lunch menu is more diverse in my opinion with some normal diner food and then a few things that mix it up some.  The chicken and waffles is a generous portion of sweet and savory that tasted quite good.  Like another reviewer noted the chicken could have come out of the fryer a little sooner but the taste was still good. 

I don't think I'll go back for breakfast but will go back for lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and two kids came here for breakfast shortly after they opened the restaurant.  It was nothing special, nothing seems homemade, reminded me of Cafe 49 in Lake Wylie.  The air conditioning was on full blast and made our food go cold very quickly.  We have never returned.

I will say however the server was nice and attentive and the place was clean."}
{"text":"BEST tuna melt ever and fries are excellent too. Regular tuna on toast is also very good."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of local.  This place is a locally owned business that recently took the place of Johnny K's.  Tucked away in a recessed shopping center next to a Food Lion.  On a recent Saturday afternoon sometimes you feel like just going out for breakfast.  Yes, I had eggs and all the fixins at home, but there's something about going out early on a Saturday before all the crazies are up.

Nicely decorated and open.  We were welcomed by a nice lady who told me to seat myself and she'd follow me.  My little one and I sat down and were quickly greeted again by our waitress.  My little one had a Belgiam Waffle with syrup and butter.  Out of curiosity I stole a bite and thought it was good.  I had a standard egg sandwich (over easy) with ham on toast.  It was right tasty.  The bowl of grits was good also.

All in all it was everything I look for in a breakfast place.  Good coffee, quick service, clean and local.  I'll be back and I hope you'll support this local business."}
{"text":"Great service everyone who worked there was super friendly. The food was great also, my wife loved her omlete. My daughters pancakes came to the table and you could smell that buttermilk smell , not only did they smell great tasted good also. I had the pork chops, eggs and homefries. Everything was great, I recommend checking them out if in the area. Kinda tucked down beside FoodLoin off of 160 but well worth it."}
{"text":"This is our first time here and the food is really good. It's inexpensive for breakfast but by no means cheap. Everything was cooked to perfection.  The biscuits are really great and homemade."}
{"text":"Excellent shrimp flounder platter! Good service on a week day at a weird eating hour, 11am."}
{"text":"everything was great. hot and quick service of items even though they are busy. a great place to get some comfort foods at reasonable costs."}
{"text":"We ate here on Dec 19th, 2014.  This was our 2nd visit to this restaurant.  The 1st visit was great!  On this particular day it was a Friday and my mother and I both ordered the fish fry. We both also had ordered different sides with our meal.  We thought the dinner was good while we ate it....Well to make a long story short we both ended up getting very sick to the point of throwing up and extreme diarrhea around 3am.  My mother called me the next morning to tell me how sick she had gotten and I informed her that I too became violently ill.  It had to have been the fish fry.  That was the only thing that we both ate that was the same. I don't know if it wasn't cleaned well or was just bad fish in general. My mother ended up calling the manager of the restaurant and speaking with him (Saturday morning).  And appearently he wasn't very apologetic and did not offer to rectify the situation in any way. My mom gave him my phone number also to call me....and I never received a call from him.  I'd also like to add that I had my 19 month old daughter with us and am SO glad that I did not give her any of this fish....Not to mention I was 25 weeks pregnant with twins at the time and throwing up with diarrhea is not something any pregnant woman wants to go thru because of a bad meal. A little more sympathy from the owner would have been a nice gesture at least. My mom refuses to eat at this restaurant ever again....Simply for the fact that the owner showed no compassion for this situation.  All I have to say is beware of the fish fry on Fridays!"}
{"text":"this is a pretty typical small town diner style restaurant. nothing fancy, but the food is hot and tastes pretty alright. i got chicken and waffles, and it was ok. chicken was a bit overcooked, so there wasn't any juiciness to it. waffle tasted as good as any waffle. they do sprinkle bacon all over it, so i guess that's a plus.

my kids got pretty standard kid menu fare--burgers and hot dog. just ok. hubs got a philly cheese steak with fries. also ok. server was nice and friendly. place seemed clean. lots of patrons when we went in, and it seemed like it was mostly older people--as what you'd expect in a diner. i wouldn't shout at the mountaintops about this place, but we'd prob go here again if we are looking for something affordable and not a fast food joint. they do free kids' meals on thursday nights from 4-8 pm too."}
{"text":"It good not great. I like home style meals and this fits the bill quite nice. They have a variety of options like fried chicken, pork chops, country fried steak, meatloaf etc. and a slew of sides that you would expect with food like this. Breakfast is served all day and is really nice. It's standard diner fair and they do a good job with it."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant.  The food is homemade and tastes so yummy!  I love the garbage plate, and I never thought I'd like a dish like that.  The servers are always friendly and the breakfasts are always spot on.

That being said, the ONLY thing I don't like about this restaurant (and the thing that cost them two stars of an otherwise perfect score) is a man I think is the owner!  Every time I've dealt with him he has been surly and so very hateful!  I think he has to know you before he's nice to you, otherwise you get a grumpy sourpuss!  Usually I don't have to have any dealings with him, but every time I do he is SO unpleasant!  He acts as if your very existence is offensive to him.  Not a great way to run a restaurant.  Let's hope whatever has him in a perpetual bad mood straightens out eventually, because even after dealing with him I like the restaurant in general!  I highly recommend the restaurant and everyone in it BUT him."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food. Prices are good too. Great spot for family dinners. Lots of options. We go here occasionally and enjoy it."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for dinner on Saturday.  It was rainy out so there weren't many people inside which was fine.  The owner guy (who wasn't very friendly or welcoming) sat us and walked off.  I couldn't help but notice how he didn't say \"Enjoy...\" or anything; just tossed the menus on the table and walked off without so much as a smile.  You know- smiles are free and they go a LONG way towards making people feel welcomed.

Ok, back to the food...  well, it just wasn't great.  The sweet tea wasn't great, the fried pickles were ok but the portion was ridiculously massive...  such a waste.  We just wanted a few so ended up throwing most of the order away.  I had the marinated chicken tips with onions and peppers over rice with fried squash and pickled beets.  The chicken was ok, not great.  The onions and peppers were also ok.  The friend squash was frozen from a bag and the beets were somehow bland.  Certainly not a meal I would return for.  My fella had the pork chops, fried okra and lima beans.  I watched him cut at those pork chops a lot before he finally gave up and pushed them to the side of his plate.  He said his okras were also frozen and that his lima beans weren't seasoned well.  

Another place that we won't be returning to... I really hoped this was going to be a hidden gem, but it's just another little run of the mill place that doesn't do anything memorable or worth returning for... sad."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this restaurant. The food is amazing.  The service is awesome. It's a great place to bring family for that home feel.  Love having our Saturday morning meals here when we are all together.  Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Went to this place based on the good reviews. The service was absolutely incredible! Wonderful atmosphere. Cool owner! The experience was awesome! I got the country fried chicken which turned out to be dry. The food was alright but I had an awesome time eating with friends and talking to the staff. I think our waitresses name was Joy and she was really great. Would go here again... Just would get something different."}
{"text":"Nice Greek owned diner. Very courteous and friendly staff. We had breakfast there and our food was very good. This place is very close to Charlotte so it's easy to get to. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Good prices and lots of food to choose from.  Try it, you will like it."}
{"text":"This is your standard diner type food.  Helpful staff. It was clean and our food came just as we ordered (which is sometimes hard for folks).  We had eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy - the normal breakfast.  All very basic, hot and fresh.  Nice local spot."}
{"text":"Best Sunday morning breakfast hands down.  Fast service and a great family run place.   Support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are breakfast regulars here; it's a great little place for a quick diner meal.  I highly recommend the Greek omelet, and I really like their French toast, too.  The serving staff is always friendly and they keep our coffee cups full.  Their grits could use a little seasoning to keep them from being bland, but that is easily fixed--just order the potatoes instead!  Overall, a solid addition to Fort Mill."}
{"text":"I've only been once so far but will definitely be back. The country fried chicken is the best I've ever had. Every bite was amazing. No additional seasoning needed. I could tell the chicken had been marinated. The pancakes were great as were the various sides we had.  This place has a great family owned feel to it. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very plain cafe. Hidden back by the Food Lion, but nice for a strip mall setting with outdoor and indoor tables.  Breakfast was unimaginative but well done.  If you want something good but not pretentious or overly weird, this is your place.  The buttered toast was a highlight for me, and so was the hot chocolate.  The omelette was standard, not that I don't appreciate that.  Last week I was in north Charlotte at another breakfast spot, and hated their food wholeheartedly.  Here you will get full."}
{"text":"Second restaurant I've been to in this location. Johnny K's is gone, but the Fort Mill Family Restaurant is here now. And as near as I can tell, it's the same folks. It's certainly the same food. Did they change the interior? I can't tell.

Inexpensive, good portions, great service, very good coffee. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"My husband and I were happy to see a breakfast restaurant open here.  The omlet was done perfectly and best grits I've had in a long time. The side dish of bacon was done really crispy just the way I like it. Added some to the grits with some jelly and the sweet/salty flavor was over the top. We want to  come back for lunch.  Oh, and they made my version of an Arnold Palmer with pink lemonade and unsweet tea. My drink of choice.  Our waitress was efficient and friendly. Made our meal that more enjoyable.  Here is hoping  they are here to stay."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! We were seated quickly. I ordered fried chicken with fried okra & peaches. My daughter ordered chicken & dumplings with fried apple (tasted like a mini apple pie yum) & cottage cheese. Meals came with corn bread & rolls. Everything tasted fantastic. The server checked back frequently & kept our drinks full. I wish I lived here to come more often but my daughter said she will be bringing her husband here. Definitely a place to try - you won't be sorry."}
