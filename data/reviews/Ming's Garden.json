{"text":"Stopped in for some General Tso's and Shrimp Lo Mein.  Everything was really good -- except for the news that they are closing this week!!!  So sad to see one of the few non-Italian options for take-out in Mount Horeb going away."}
{"text":"It's OK, the service is typical of any Chinese buffet and the food quality is OK.  It is better than the Chinese buffet down the road in Oregon so I guess they have that going for them."}
{"text":"A great \"box\" Chinese restaurant with cheap prices and your typical selection. The vegetables I've had are always fresh. The staff seems like mostly like a bunch of kids run the place but its all good. I've never had problems and would recommend it to try for take-out."}
{"text":"The Ming's Garden on this yelp is not the same exact as the current one. I believe it reopened with new owners and I definitely did not see any Thai or Japanese options on the menu(It looked like typical box Chinese restaurant stuff.) The place was dead when I was there. Unfortunately no customers+buffet = very unattended buffet. The soup was starting to have a not-so-appealing surface on the top from sitting all day and not being stirred. For a while I thought I got there after close the way it felt but I realized it was open another hour and a half. They were nice enough though to ask me what I wanted that wasn't at the buffet and made a generous serving for me. The \"noise level\" of this place is abysmally quiet. There was no music and all I could hear was my own fork clanking against my plate. I'm sorry but PLEASE at least give me some music."}
{"text":"Ming's garden is OK.  For a suburban Chinese place, the food isn't bad, but it's also not great.  My expectation of a pick-up Chinese restaurant is good, cheap, and fast - I don't think Ming's excels in any of these areas.   However, I will return again, as it's convenient and decent."}
{"text":"The food here was so-so.  I ordered Sichuan pork and it wasn't hot at all.  The sauce tasted more like the sweetest, gloppiet sweet and sour sauce you've ever tasted.  Way too sweet and I actually like the gloppy sauces when they're done well.  My wife liked the egg foo young.  The menu overall tries to do too much.  It has both Thai and Chinese menus.  There is also a buffet there which some might like.  This place just needs to get out of the made for non-exotic palates of America."}
