{"text":"There is no doubt that Otto's is a great, classic, establishment.  I have met a number of outstanding, classy, sophisticated, women in the lower level bar.  Bartenders are absolutely excellent.  The bar menu is outstanding & features quality items (not your routine \"Bar Food\"). Upstairs, where the true spirit of Otto's really shines. By far, the finest dining experience on the West side of Madison.  Quite often I drive by and don't stop, simply because I'm \"under-dressed\" (Blue Jeans).  Honestly, take a date for drinks and Appetizers in the lower level.  If the date is going well...take her upstairs to demonstrate your level of sophistication."}
{"text":"Otto's is my go-to restaurant and bar for dates, business dinners and girlfriend get togethers. Kim, the bartender, in the quaint downstairs bar is a favorite. She remembers your drink order -- always a dirty Belvedere martini and then a glass of fruity pinot noir -- and remembers to refill your water glass. The mussels is my favorite dish on the menu -- a fantastic appetizer or entree with a salad. When looking for more filling dishes, I'll pick the duck or the sea bass. The mediterranean platter is perfect when I feel like a veggie meal, but I also occasionally choose the bruschetta or the crab cakes, which are very nice. Always a great wine list and the upstairs dining in summer (especially Thursday jazz nights) is lovely and relaxing. No one is ever going to hurry you out. If you are looking for quick chain-restaurant service, forget it. This is a slow food place and although the services isn't slow, it's not lightening speed either. And that's the way I like it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice family dinner here on New Year's Eve.  Ambience: Cozy, romantic, and classy. We were on the third floor, where tables were squeezed together pretty tightly. It got a little noisy so you had to speak up to be heard across the table, but it wasn't unpleasantly loud. One person had been there before and said it was quieter on the second floor.   Service: Attentive and friendly.   Food: Very good, but some misses. I ordered the lamb chops based on prior reviews and I was very pleased. They were tender (get them cooked according to the chef's rec, medium-rare) and paired with a delicious pesto sauce. My husband ordered the lobster tail (a New Year's Eve special) and it was delightfully buttery and lemony. Others in the group ordered the duck (she liked it) and the Mediterranean grill (he said it was fine, but not amazing).  The appetizers were where we were a bit unsatisfied. The butter served with the warm rolls was cold--no one likes to spread cold butter!--and the garden salads that came with the entrees were only dressed greens, no veggies or other add-ins. I got the caesar salad, which was fine but a little overdressed. We also ordered the mussels, which were very good (the cream sauce was delicious, and great for dipping the rolls into if you got tired of the cold butter) and the crab cakes. I definitely do NOT recommend the crab cakes--no one in our group could actually taste any crab. I think it was a combination of skimping on crab meat and over-seasoning in the breading.  Overall, we had a really nice meal. I would definitely go back for another New Year's dinner, order the lamb, and skip the crab cakes."}
{"text":"The most delish food in Madison.    This is where you take a date if you really want to impress her/him.  The food is so good, but it can be a bit rich.  Sometimes there is live music on the patio.  The drinks are yum.  It is not cheap here but it is well worth the price.   Also nice is that Otto's is in a non-convenient location making it more of a hidden gem then a trendy restaurant."}
{"text":"I love here!Foods are amazing and people are nice.My favorite dessert is Fresh Strawberry Napoleon.Grilled ribeye and Grilled Salmon in Grape Leafs are excellent.My husband loves the lamb chop very much."}
{"text":"Stop by three times during business trip this past February. Ordered a buttery sea bass, which was the best I've ever had anywhere. Other folks with me ordered from the tasting menu. I tasted some and they were excellent and reasonably priced at $35. This includes a refreshing and colorful beet salad, entree (lamb/pork), delightful espresso flavored flan dessert, and flight of wine for paring for each course at additional $10. The options change each week, but choices were all great.  The cheese plate was also good to share. We had a large group with approximately 10 people during two of my visits.  The staff were attentive and friendly. If I return to Wisconsin, this will be a must stop for dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific!! I have only had the pleasure to eat here a few times but it is probably the best food I have had since the old Kickshaws on PD closed. The food is fresh and unpretentious and was served by a waitress who was attentive yet unobtrusive.   Great place if you have a few extra dollars to spend.  Recommend:  Start with the wrapped shrimp  Ceasar Salad  Lamb chops or Filet  and finish with ANY flavor sorbet   Seafood was great also"}
{"text":"Second time we have been here and excellent both times. Went for graduation celebration first time.  Excellent wines. Tonight out party of three had steak and seafood both of which were excellent. The chocolate cake for desert was awesome"}
{"text":"Great bar and drinks. They know how to make a decent martini. Duck, salmon, and Mediterranean platter were all excellent. This is a little, off-track place that seems to do everything well."}
{"text":"Food is always phenomenal. My wife and I had the chef's four course with wine pairings $45 each - four very nice glasses of wine that vary depending on your food selection. Only reason for four stars is we left feeling a little hungry. We should have loaded up on the fresh bread we didn't eat because we were saving room for the meal.  We go once a year, by happenstance, and will probably forget we left unsatisfied when we show up next spring."}
{"text":"We miss the prior proprietor who ran a wonderful restaurant with outstanding food, great ambience, and reasonable prices. The quality of the food is the same, the ambience remains, but the prices have jumped 20 per cent. Still a great choice for good dining."}
{"text":"Wow.  Me; a Bartender with a Friday night off to spend with my family?  During Restaurant Week?  Uncanny!  Not interested in who's participating in RW, I just want a nice place to go.  Enter the OpenTable app on my BB on Wednesday night.  Result:  Otto's.  8:30PM on Friday evening.  Reservation confirmed.  ...Fast forward to Friday evening; we arrive on a frigid January night to Otto's; on Mineral Point Rd yet tucked away like a precious pearl.  I tell the hostess reservation for 3 under the last name C_____ and she seats us right away.  An old establishment with hella charm and warmth.  Our waitress arrives with a genuine smile and an equally appealing nature.  Her name is Linda L.  Linda converses with us a bit before taking our drink orders.  We have a bit in common and talk about more than a few things throughout the course of our courses.  My party was there eating and talking for about 2-hours with not a lot of traffic on our floor.  Although we'll be back soon, I'd love to come here when Jack Frost is outta town; say like June...  Here's the rundown of our dinner enjoyment that evening:  A Bombay Sapphire Martini-Up w/ a Twist A Mount Gay Rum & Cola A glass of G/Marquis Philips Shiraz A glass of Pierre Ferrand Cognac 2 Sprites   1 Order of The Duck w/ a Cesar Salad w/ Anchovies 1 Order of Petite Steak (Med. Well) & Shrimp w/ Cesar Salad, no anchovies, no croutons 1 Order of Ricotta Chicken 1 Coffee  Total: $108.  Not bad.  So.  Go to Otto's on Mineral Pt Rd on the West side of Madison.   Seriously.  Go here.  Eat.  Drink.  Be Merry and don't forget to tip your wait person at least 20%!  Buen Provecho..."}
{"text":"Thanks for the nice reviews from Yelp, my husband and I chose the Otto's to celebrate my birthday. We enjoyed everything there including food, service and the atmosphere.  Initially, we had a little trouble finding the entrance on the rainy December evening, felt somewhat overwhelmed passing the small crowded bar area to locate the host. However, after we checked in for our reservation, we were seated immediately at the table in the cozy corner on second floor, and the rest of the evening was relaxing and romantic.  Our server was polite and prompt, said \"happy birthday\" to me after briefly introduced himself. I wish he could speak a little slower when introducing the specials given that we are nonnative English speakers and often slow to catch up with the ingredients, but he was nice to repeat when requested.  My husband really liked the freshly baked bread with butter. The margarita was tasty with two straws, which I considered necessary to avoid eating the salt on the glass. The house green salads, combined with olive oil, vinegar and sparkled with some peppers, were very refreshing and appetizing.  For entrees, husband chose the salmon special and I picked the scallop based on our server's recommendation. Both were so beautifully presented that we even took photos before we ate. The scallops, juicy and delicious, satisfied our tasting buds greatly. I also tried a piece of salmon offered by hubby and liked it too.  The restaurant also offered us complementary desserts for my birthday, which we gladly took home to our kids. The cakes and the cream were also well enjoyed.  The Otto's is definitely a good for special occasions. Things there are expensive but well worth the money."}
{"text":"This is a place for retirees with so-so taste buds want to have an upscale dinner. We ordered a Chilean sea bass ($29) and a rib eye steak ($29). Both of the dishes were nothing but the presentation. The meat was probably pre-frozen and lack of flavor. The fish was dry, although a Chilean sea bass should be super succulent. The pomegranate martini was watery. Everything was mediocre. Although they have boosters and highchairs, they have nil tolerance for young patrons. One of the customers, a women of late 50s, yelled at us - yes, she yelled at us at dinner tables - to take our 1 y.o. out of the place when he was fussing. The owner did not even address this female customer's inappropriate outburst. No matter what the situation was, that kind of aggression should never be tolerated - by anyone. There is a way of saying it rather than acting out. This woman, by screaming in public like that, minimized herself to a same level as our 1 y.o. baby. The owner clearly did not realize that we were also the customers who paid the expensive tub. We'll never ever go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Amazing lamb chops. Great service and dessert was amazing. Great location. Easy to Find being from out of town."}
{"text":"I haven't been in Otto's for dinner in a while.  I'm often in there for drinks with friends. It's a great place for a quiet drink, and if you're there on the weekend Rob & Kim will take good care of you.  I enjoy their James Bond vodka martinis, but only in moderation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been making me birthday reseravations at Otto's for the past 2 years, the service is the best, we had a exceptional waiter who recommended us the perfect wines to compliment our dinner and was really great at making it a high quality dining experience. I feel like it is one of the few places in the Madison area that you will not be out of place if you feel like being super dressy and the restaraunt itself is beautiful. The only complaint I would have to make is that the menu doesn't seem to change so we decided to try somewhere new this year. If the menu changed I would no doubt return."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant we have stumbled onto yet in Madison. Simply put, it's a hidden gem that we never would have found had my dad not moved in next door. Last Saturday, we pulled up at about 9 p.m. The place closes at 9:30, so it would have been fair of them to rush us or even turn us away. We walked into the bar and the bartender very kindly noticed that my dad was using a walker and told us about ramps on the side of the restaurant. It was a very cold night out but one of the employees actually went around to the other side and waited for us outside, in short sleeves, to offer assistance to my dad and hold the door. Once seated, we were just blown away by the cozy, quaint decor. This is an old house dating back to the 1800s which has been either beautifully restored or maintained. Either way, a restaurant in a house can be overly precious but that was not the case with Otto's. The whole experience was so warm and welcoming. Our server did not seem rushed and there was a large party next to us which had obviously been there for hours. This is truly like dining at someone's lovely home. The service was impeccable and the food absolutely exceeded our expectations. Everything was delicious and the attention to detail was evident everywhere. The bread was freshly baked for the table! At 9:30 at night! The cocktail and wine lists were thoughtful and not at all overpriced. The tomato and mushroom bisques were so good that we wanted to lick our bowls. For dinner, we all had some variation of seafood (grape leaf- wrapped salmon, scallops and a seafood trio, all accompanied by either rice or potatoes and beautifully presented and seasoned). Entrees may seem pricey at first glance but are not, for everything you get with it (and I am including the friendly, professional, knowledgeable service when I say that). Dessert was another welcome surprise, with housemade gelato that was as good (or even better) than I've tasted in Rome. The consistency was so creamy and the raspberry so flavorful that I wanted more the next day! Unfortunately, Otto's is closed on Sundays and Mondays. That said, I would make another trip here unhesitatingly. The experience was perfect and memorable in every way and my dad is so happy to have this so close to him in his new home."}
{"text":"A very charming little place hidden away behind the trees on Mineral point. At first impression, I didn't think it would be comfortable, as the tables are quite squished into the old house, now serving as a restaurant.  The size became less of an issue as I glanced over the menu to discover all the mouth watering choices.  I chose the Chef's Choice 3 course meal with wine tasting. I started with a bloody mary, which was probably the worst one I've had in Madison. I don't recommend at all unless you prefer little to no spice. After attempting to spice it up myself with pepper, I sent it back.  Not to worry though, because they brought me a very tasty dirty martini.  The food was amazing, but the waitress forgot to bring my wine with the first course. She made up for it by bringing a very nice shiraz with my steak, on the house.  My dinner party was very much satisfied with the food. The waitress, although forgetful, was polite and apologetic. I definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say the food was amazing.  I had the New Zealand lamb, and it was the best lamb I have ever had in my life.  I've eaten at a lot of high end restaurants across the country, and I can easily say that the lamb at Otto's is some of the best.  I ordered it medium rare (as you should do if you are eating high quality meat) and it was cooked perfectly.  It was served with a chimichurri that was delicious and had the perfect blend of herbs and gave a nice saltiness to the lamb.   We had the bruschetta and the cheese sampler plate for appetizers.  Both of these were very good, and I would definitely order them again.  The bruschetta had some sort of whipped feta (that's what it tasted like) that complimented the chopped tomatoes and olives perfectly.  My wife had the Chilean sea bass and it was also really tasty.  The reason I give Otto's a 4 star review is because our service was sub-par.  Our waitress was pretty cold towards us when she realized we weren't going to order alcohol.  She never asked us if we needed anything or if our food was good.  She came occasionally and filled our water and left.  It just didn't feel like she really cared.  Overall our experience was good because I don't go to a restaurant just for the service.  I go for the food and the food was phenomenal.  If you want to have some lamb that knocks your socks off go to Otto's."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good. Had the ribeye and sampler appetizer and everything was great. I'm from out of town but will eat here again if income back through Madison"}
{"text":"Took my foodie parents here.  We all were sooo impressed.  Great drinks from the bar, and delicious fresh food."}
{"text":"We thought our food and service was out standing!!  ( There is room for improvement on the house salad ) but, everything else was excellent!"}
{"text":"My dad's staying at Oakwood next door and I've been trotting out to get him whatEVER sounds good for dinner.  Tonight it was steak.  Otto's looked nice albeit a bit pricey for takeout and they had ribeye.  Okeydokey then.  I called and ordered broiled mushroom caps, ribeye dinner medium rare and an extra dinner ceasar.  We were gonna split it.  They said 15 minutes it would be at the bar and lo and behold there it was waiting for me when I walked in.  I ran it back next door and got it all set up.  Everything was packed separately and well so the warm things stayed warm and the salads were separated.  They'd even asked if I wanted the dressing on the side.  The ribeye was still nice and pink in the middle when we cut in to it.  They'd packaged a little loaf of bread for us as well. Total bill was $43.  For a nice steak dinner for two, not bad.  Dad was happy, I was happy."}
{"text":"An amazing experience all around. I found this place on a Yelp search and I am so glad I did. The restaurant is in a restored farmhouse and you might drive by it if you didn't know where to look. We did not have a reservation but they seated us on the deck on a beautiful late summer evening. We started with the crabcakes a unique version I had never had before. Lots of Indian and Mediterranean flavors with crunchy chick peas. The soup was a tomato bisque that was quite good but could have been better with basil. The duck. OMG was fantastic. I have worked in restaurants I have cooked duck in restaurants and this duck was some of the best I have ever had. The breast was cooked just under medium and the leg and thigh had delicious crispy skin. The potatoes were amazing and the green beans were fresh and we'll seasoned. The amount could have been cut in half and I would have been happy Finally the cheesecake was spectacular, I have never had such creamy cheesecake ever. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Even though we were sadly disappointed that we could not sit outside on the patio, the food was excellent! The scallops were perfection, and my co-worker loved the Chilean Sea Bass as well. Really wish we could gave experienced the patio atmosphere...there was live music and we wished we could have experienced it."}
{"text":"Another classic example of an overrated and overpriced restaurant.   I've been to Otto's twice -- once for a rehearsal dinner and once for a birthday. For the rehearsal dinner, it was a preset menu and although it was technically free, it was just meh. The appetizers were okay, but the entree selections were not enticing at all. At the birthday dinner, I ordered the ribeye steak. It was on the more bland end and the steak was tougher rather than tender. Again, the appetizers were slightly better -- the calamari was standard and the Mediterranean meatballs were okay.  All in all, Otto's food was not absolutely horrible. My diagnosis of overrated and overpriced just means that for the price you pay, there is no doubt you can find better quality and better tasting dishes."}
{"text":"Just apps tonight - lamb kofta good the charcuterie plate outstanding! Great atmosphere with a local band on the porch - highly recommend"}
{"text":"My wife and I were intrigued by this place branding itself as a seafood place so we decided to try it. The restaurant  looks like slightly fancier version of Olive Garden and is in fact frequented by several old customers. We ordered a tasting menu which consisted of appetizer, one main course, and one dessert. We both ordered the trout soup and the linguine with mussels and lobster. For dessert I had the cheese platter and my wife had the bread pudding. The soup was fairly standard, I will say cafeteria quality. The linguini tasted not the bad but nothing special either. Some of the mussels were not fully open and fully cooked which was pretty bad. My cheese player had a single slice of cheese which was pretty disappointing.   PROS - pretty good price for a tasting menu - not many good restaurant in this location  CONS - cheesy decor - you can get more interesting food at most downtown restaurants fur the same price"}
{"text":"Wow! I had always wanted to try Otto's and it did not disappoint. I went here on a date night with my sugar and we both loved every morsel. Salmon, scallops, and crab cakes oh my!!"}
{"text":"Otto's ambiance is always inviting. We had a nice table on the second floor. Our waiter was very friendly and professional. The only misstep was the half hour between salad and entrée, not his fault of course. We started with the exquisite cheese course, ordering all five cheeses. The bleu was to die for, creamy, salty with the right amount of sharpness you expect from a bleu. We felt the course was a bit overpriced. The salads were nothing special. I had the salmon special and my wife had the stuffed chicken. Our friends both ordered steak. Our meals were wonderful, everything cooked as we asked. Our only complaint is that everything seemed to be overpriced by about $5."}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for a graduation dinner with my parents. Before dining, I was disappointed this was the only place I could find that still had openings and wished I had found something closer to campus. However, I ultimately was thrilled with my decision. So thrilled that I decided to write my first yelp review. The restaurant was quaint but still appropriately formal for a celebratory college graduation dinner. The food was great and the staff was friendly. Great find."}
{"text":"My husband I went here for a nice dinner and looking for a little atmosphere with our night out.  We found exactly that with Otto's.  The martini at the bar was served very chilled, they have a decent wine list, although not the best I've ever seen.  The entrees were delicious and presented beautifully.  The only critique I can offer is that the wait staff was a bit cool in reception and serving us at our meal.   The charm of the old farm house was warm, delightful and gave us a feeling of old world charm coupled with fine dining.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"What can I say? After returning to Madison after a ten year absence...even more since I had been to Ottos, my sister and her husband wanted to go there for their 23 wedding anniversary.  Ok.  Reservations were made.  We stopped by the bar for a cocktail pre dinner.  Good vibe. Great drinks.  Up we go to the main dinning room. Because it is in a house there are different levels. The first table was one of the worse ones in the space. I politely asked for a different one. No problem.  There are steaks, pasta and some seafood choices.  The place is billed as a Mediterranean, but I don't see that distinction...oh they have penne pasta and basil vinegaret.  Anyway I have what was suppose to be Scottish salmon wrapped  in grape leaves  with some balsamic vinegar reduction.  The salmon was hammered and the sauce grainy and an off putting  color. I scrapped it off.  If that was Scottish salmon welll... Steaks were cooked to temperature and the scallops were a wee bit over but tastey.  Service excellent, attentive without being intrusive. Bread and soup or salad are included.  All in all it was a nice but average experience."}
{"text":"Excellent meal.  The cocktails were just right, followed by a great meal.  My wife had the sea bass while I had a seafood mixed grill.  We did not have room for desert! Our waitress was attentive and helpful.  I would not hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"SOOO good!  Went for my birthday dinner and everything was perfect.  The ambience is lovely.  It's in a converted 3-story house.  The bar is on the bottom floor, the kitchen and small dining area on the second, and another dining floor on the third.  It was way too cold for the patio, but it looked nice.  The food was phenomenal -- we had the Moroccan crab cake appetizer, New Zealand lamb chops and salmon fillet special, and strawberry Napoleon.  The crab cakes were small but lots of crab rather than filler.  Came with aioli and savory jam.  The lamb chops were remarkably well-cooked, with a lovely basil mint sauce and roasted red potatoes and crisp green beans.  The salmon fillet was also beautifully cooked, with an olive tapenade, tomato risotto, and the same crispy green beans.  The Napoleon looked strange at first glance but tasted great, especially the strawberries.  Prices are very reasonable, particularly for such high quality food.    The service was equal to the food.  That's pretty unusual for any restaurant, so I need to give this place particularly high praise.  Our waiter was prompt, knowledgeable, and had charming voice cadence.  I asked for a decaf coffee with sugar and it appeared within seconds.  Really some of the best service we have experienced in Madison.    Would go back anytime, special occasion or not!  Can't wait to try out the patio next summer."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday last night with my family at Ottos.  It was my first time eating dinner there and we had a lovely meal.  I had the sea bass and it was fantastic.  Both my husband and father in law had the lamb, wow, it was delicious.  My mother in law had the ribeye and she said she really liked it as well.  My only small complaint was that the salad was overly dressed, but the dressing was great, I had the lemon vinaigrette.  I liked the wine list as well and it was very affordable.  Our service was spot on as well.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Dinner at Otto's was superb as always.  Food was great.  Service was wonderful.  Can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  It's been a favorite of ours for many years."}
{"text":"Really good food and delicious cocktails.  I ate here with some friends on the patio with the band.  The music was nice and not too loud so that we didn't have to shout.  You should definitely have a reservation if it is a nice night out.    Many nice appitizers on the menu and you can make a meal just of those.  The martinis were delicous.  If your 30 something, come for a new experience, but expect that you will be the children in the crowd.... as most are around the retirement age."}
{"text":"Coming from LA, my standards are extremely high and this seems to be one of Madison's best kept secrets...with a great happy hour that seems to go utterly unadvertised.  WTH, why didn't you guys tell me about this place sooner?  We had a few appetizers in the bar and ended up staying for dinner.  Probably the best seafood in Madison.  The grilled salmon wrapped in grape leaves was the group favorite, but everyone loved the steak, too.  Also, the muscles appetizer was phenomenal.  Mediterranean platter was great, but a lot more food than we had expected...might have ordered too much.  Not that that stopped us from getting a strawberry Napoleon, which rivaled any dessert in town.  One of the people who went with us has a few very severe food allergies and the chef was extremely accommodating. He even came out to our table to speak with her personally about what she could and could not eat, explaining that he had a lot of experience cooking for people with particular restrictions and that he makes everything fresh so there's no hidden gluten or other ingredients that might be a problem.  The wine selection was great and they have multiple high-end varieties by the glass.   The bar can get a little crowded, but it seemed to clear out pretty quickly after 7-ish.  I am so happy to have found something like this on the West Side so I don't need to truck all the way down to Willie St or The Square every time I want a great meal."}
{"text":"Overall the experience was very pleasant here and the food was good. The service was a little slow, but I think it's one of those restaurants that they aren't rushing you and just trying to get you your food and out the door as quickly as possible. For appetizers we ordered the calamari and brushetta, both very very good! I then ordered the Cesar side salad - the dressing was a little heavy on this. My friend ordered the stuff chicken, another ordered the scallops, another the lamb chops, and I ordered the spinach artichoke pasta. I was so full that I couldn't even finish my entree and try their dessert which looked awesome. Next time I'll have to save room so I can try it!"}
{"text":"Otto's is a great restaurant serving up some delicious Mediterranean food. The hummus combo plate starter is excellent. Sitting outside on a gorgeous day listening to live music always makes this an incredible experience. I absolutely love Ottos and will continue to return here to dine and enjoy some great music."}
{"text":"Very Good. We'll be back for sure.   Memorial to Labor Day, they have live music out on the deck Tuesday-Thursday(music starts at 5:30, but you can only reserve a table up unto 6:00. After that it's first come, first serve.), and we finally got to go!   It was a gorgeous night to be outside, and the deck is charming. We were seated at the table right in front of the band, which I was excited about--until I realized how loud it was going to be. Wasn't the best place for a conversation. Next time I'll ask for the side deck. You can't see the band, but I bet you could still hear fine.  A friend(and our server) recommended the salmon in grape leaves. It was flavorful and moist, but the sauce was too sweet for me. Spinach was fresh and not overcooked, but it was a little watery, which ran into the rest of my plate.  He got the mixed seafood grill. Salmon, diver scallops and shrimp, with roasted fennel, artichokes and potato--I kept sneaking bites.(The fennel was AMAZING). The basil pesto was fresh and flavorful, but there was a lot. One way to get him to eat his veggies is to douse them in fat, though. He wasn't complaining(I might ask for less). Good portions and we both had some packaged to go. He's a creme brûlée lover-and thought Otto's was good, with flecks of vanilla bean.   I saw several people digging into sampler plates, which would be great with a bottle of wine and a few friends.  Pros:  *Food was good(and now I know what to order NEXT time). Priced fair for what you are getting($60 for two seafood dinners, two drinks, and one dessert) *FREE Jazz in the summer? Yes please.  Cons:  *The deck is pitched forward, and because of how I was seated, I felt like I was doing an abs workout trying to stay upright while eating(maybe NOT a con?). *My bottled iced tea--while tasty--was the same price as his Capital beer."}
{"text":"All I knew about Otto's prior to dining there was that they had Mediterranean cuisine. My experience with most Mediterranean restaurants, with the exception of a few fancy Greek spots, is they are usually casual. So Otto's was a nice surprise: the cozy comforting reassurance of an old school bar, the Old farmhouse setting with different levels, and the more formal white tablecloth service. Definitely a five on ambiance.  My dining companion and I had a drink at the bar before dinner. I noticed they have 1/2 price appetizers Mondays thru Thursdays. One of my favorite things to do at a Mediterranean place is eating \"tapas\" style because the appetizers are usually so good. And such is the case here with a number of mixed plates: Wisconsin cheeses, seafood and apps plates with hummus. And not one nacho or deep-fried cheese curd to be found! At half price, these would be a great value, though they are priced fairly to start. We didn't on this occasion try the appetizers, but I know I'll be back to belly up to this great little bar for a cocktail and apps.  The menu with dinner items, Mediterranean specials, salads and appetizers is a difficult one for an indecisive Libra like me. Lots of great seafood offerings, and every dish sounding mouth-watering. I chose as an entree a salmon baked in grape leaves and my dinner companion got the three seafood platter. Both were served with lusciously flavored greens and potatoes. The Caesar salad beforehand was just OK. Nice little warm buns come with the meal, too.  Otto's is on the pricier side, but worth every bit of it. And what a great place to celebrate a birthday or have a date night. While the outdoor spaces were not available during our January visit, I'm sure the two different levels of patios make this place very festive in summer. Otto's was simply an overall experience which well exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"We finally gave this restaurant another shot and I am so glad that we did. We came here with another couple on a Saturday night. (Highly recommend having reservations-which we did). We were greatly warmly and quickly seated. We started with the grilled prosciutto wrapped shrimp (which was absolutely fabulous). Then two of us had the tomato bisque soup (which is so good, that it is guaranteed to create happy food dreams for weeks to come) and the other two ordered the Caesar salad and were very impressed at its flavor. We all ordered different entrees. One the lamb, one the grilled scallops, the special of the white fish, and the stuffed chicken. Everyone loved their entrees so much that there was no opportunity to share. Dessert was the chocolate mousse, strawberry Napoleon, and the pistachio gelato. All were very much enjoyed. Absolutely fabulous meal!!!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I give Otto's bar a 4-Star rating. I'm less thrilled with the formal dining area. The bar area has vibe and you can order the full dinner menu in the bar. The cocktails are skillfully crafted... They have lovely blue cheese stuffed olives for the martinis. This makes me happy.   When I'm hanging out in the bar, I generally order some appetizers and or a desert. The bacon wrapped shrimp is my favorite appetizer. You can get these little gems solo or as part of the Mediterranean platter, which also includes humus and bruschetta.   The best desert is the Napoleon - wonderful lightly sweetened phyllo dough provides the structure and a silky custard provides the sexiness."}
{"text":"Excellent meal tonight with great food and service.  The mixed grill is deliciouus, especially the perfectly seasoned and juicy lamb chops.  The  kofte was slightly greasy but very nicely seasoned.  The chicken was good but not outstanding.  But the lamb!  Next time I'm just getting the lamb chops.  They were so amazing.  The parmesan truffle fries were light and crispy and the side portion was huge.  Same for the crispy onion strings.  The cracked wheat pilaf was flavorful without any trace of greasiness, which is a common problem in many varieties.  Entree portions are pretty small but the service was very fast although I did need to remind them to bring my tea twice.  Beer selection is decent.  I selected to have a 3-cheese plate for dessert.  The mild brick was definitely my favorite, with a creamy, sweet flavor.  The crackers were the perfect complement.  A great option for a weekend dinner."}
{"text":"I think Otto's is pretty great for the west side but sometimes is hit or miss. Great romantic decor in the upstairs area, bit of a dive in the downstairs bar. They make the best homemade crackers, be sure to ask for them. Love their cocktails and steaks."}
{"text":"A fellow trainee found Ottos using open table and invited the rest of us to join for dinner. I loved the structure - an older house with a bar at the bottom and tables on the upper levels. The  menus had typical Wisconsin cuisine (steaks, potatoes, cheese ). I opted for the New Zealand Lamb Chops which were delicious! Overall I had a nice dining experience and they waitress and bartender were very nice."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful; however, the atmosphere was too loud. I could not hear my dinner companion across the table."}
{"text":"I LOVE the decor and ambience of this place! I first came here to celebrate Valentine's day with my boyfriend in 2014 (before I was a Yelp member!), and left with fond memories. I visited Otto's again while my friends and my boyfriend's family was in town, and it did not disappoint!   After devouring two bread baskets, we started with two orders of mussels. I definitely forgot how generous they are with the mussel appetizer, but hey, I can't complain! We also had the Ottos Sampler, the crispy shrimp and the shrimp cocktail. Everyone raved about the crispy shrimp, which was wrapped in prosciutto, and fried to perfection. Most of us had the tomato bisque after the appetizers, which was very tasty (and this is coming from someone who hates tomatoes!).   Our entrees arrived all at the same time, and were presented very beautifully. As a casual insta-foodie, plating is very important to me as a first impression, and this definitely did not disappoint. I had the scallops with gnocchi, which was the special of the night. The scallops were huge, the gnocchi was pillowy and the sauce was a perfect compliment. I will say that the crispy kale that was sprinkled on top was extremely salty, but I know how easy it is to over-salt crispy kale (speaking from experience!).   Overall, our entire party left the restaurant happy, and extremely full. The service was great, and our waitress was friendly and very professional. I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic or intimate dinner, and definitely try to make reservations in advance!"}
{"text":"Easily the best lamb chops I've ever had.   We went for my girlfriends birthday. The place was very quiet, and for a large portion of our meal we had the entire main dining area to ourselves, which was wonderful and intimate. Our waitress was fantastic-- around enough to make sure we were well taken care of, but mindful to give us time together.  Wine selection great-- reasonably priced and our Pinot Noir was delicious. Bread, salads, calamari appetizer all excellent. And those lamb chops-- cannot say enough good things. Perfectly cooked inside, perfectly charred outside, with an incredible mint pesto sauce. They allowed us to pick whatever dessert we wanted for her birthday, on the house, and the creme brulee was great. Overall, a wonderful, intimate, romantic setting with food that is everything we could have asked for."}
{"text":"If you love seafood - this is the best place in town for mussels. I spent 5 months kayaking in the Marlborough Sounds on the South Island of New Zealand - every night we would harvest mussels growing on rocks in the ocean and cook them over the fire. New Zealand mussels are incredible - much larger and more flavorful than mussels you see in restaurants in the U.S. Otto's ships in fresh New Zealand mussels and they are exquisite - like you are sitting on a beach in New Zealand. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"PROS: Decent-sized portions CONS: Pricey, mediocre  Otto's is like walking into your uncle Bob's kitchen. Bob wants to show off his culinary skills since he started taking an Italian cooking class the week before. He prepares a table full of dishes full of fancy ingredients, but his execution falls short. The food tastes very much like the meat-and-potatoes that he usually makes, but fancier-looking and with more expensive ingredients. He also screws up and undercooks some seafood and brings out the wrong wine for his guests.  Under such a circumstance, I'd be okay. However, imagine if Bob tries to charge you $30 a plate for the food. Not so happy then, right? That is exactly how I felt about Otto's. The food is more homey, the staff is nice, but the prices are too high for what you get."}
{"text":"My husband and I had drinks/dinner at Otto's to celebrate my recent birthday.  After reading the Yelp reviews and hearing verbal reviews from others I must admit I left there a bit disappointed.  Our drinks, appetizer and meals were very delicious - a bit overpriced, but everything was quick and tasty.  However, the service was kind of cold.  This was our first time at Otto's and we both felt that because we weren't regulars we were kind of ignored."}
{"text":"Go for Happy Hour!  The appetizers are fantastic, especially the crab cakes!  Entrees are mediocre, as are the desserts.  But, I will always go back for apps!"}
{"text":"So I went here for prom last year. Forgot to write a review but I saw Otto's featured in the State Journal so I just wanted to add some stuff.  First of all, if you're a vegetarian, you can DEFINITELY eat here. I'm a vegan now and it might be a little tricky, but still doable. The review in the paper said it wasn't recommended for veg people but I ate plenty and well here.  The group I came with was small and the place wasn't busy but service was still kind of slow. That's my only complaint.  As for the food - yummy! My group (all three of us :p) started with the Mediterranean Platter. It was delish and fresh. I believe one of my friends had the salmon in grape leaves and loved it. She let me try the sauteed spinach and that was good too. In fact, she still talks about going back again haha. My other friend had the shrimp app as her main course and enjoyed it as well. I had spinach artichoke pasta. It was om nom nommy and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to restaurants. I know I'll always receive excellent service and great food.   They have a vibrant bar scene and you can reserve a table in the bar but I prefer to dine upstairs at a more leisurely pace.   Karl Granberg's chef tasting menu is wonderful and the wine pairings are thoughtful. Each week they change which makes you want to return every week.  The scallops are my favorite. Nicely charred and perfectly done. The Mediterranean mixed grill is a house specialty. It consists of lamb chops marinated chicken and kofte. Very good.   During happy hour appetizers are discounted. The mussels are excellent as are the crab cakes. Save room for dessert. The bread pudding is served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Blood orange sorbet and chocolate gelato are also good choices."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, overpriced food that was only average, drinks also overpriced. Saying that, it is a pleasant outdoor dining area"}
{"text":"This is going to be a new addition to our rotations of restaurants to visit. Husband and I ordered the Otto's sampler, Maple Leaf Duck, and Chilean Sea Bass. Everything was cooked to perfection and nicely flavored, especially my duck breasts. Loved that cherry glaze! If you're looking for something innovative on the menu, you won't find it here. However it does what it does very well, which is perfecting traditional recipe's and offering rustic, straight forward home cooked meals. Great value for what they charge.  Warning: Huge portions! You will be stuffed! But they have a nice yard for you to walk it off afterwards. :)"}
{"text":"This is a special Madison gem and I highly recommend trying it out. Start with a martini if you can in the bar... Quite tasty. But if you go... You must have the lamb chops. I haven't had them anyplace better. They are amazing! Good service and a nice comfy atmosphere. You will not go wrong with this Madison classic."}
{"text":"I took myself to dinner at Otto's on Friday night, expecting to find a seat at the bar which is intimate and relaxed...  No such luck.  The bar was full when I got there, not a seat to be found anywhere.  The crowd was a little older than myself, average range 50-60 yrs old.  I liked the atmosphere of the bar area and was disappointed that I had to go up the stairs for seating at a table for 1.  I was determined to try the food however, and shook it off.  The host was very accommodating and offered me my pick of tables.  I settled on one upstairs (on the the 2nd floor of the old farmhouse).  I started with the cheese plate where I selected the gouda and petit frere, which came with grapes, apples, and crackers.  Very nice presentation and a tasty appetizer.  For my entree I decided on the scallops.  The presentation, again, was beautiful.  Saffron rice in the center, scallops around the perimeter, with asparagus \"bridges\" hinged on the rice.  I nearly finished the entire plate - very, very delicious.  I recommend the restaurant as a relaxing evening out when you want to be assured you are going to get a great meal.  Dining alone was not optimal in this setting as it was very group & couple oriented but would have been better in the bar area."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Otto's in celebration of my dad's birthday. My sister, being intolerant to gluten, was well taken care of, even served gluten-free bread! Those pursuing a gluten-free diet know well that restaurant dessert options are often nonexistent. Flourless chocolate cake seems to be their go-to, if any. Otto's is an exception. They offered extensive gluten-free options for my sister, including her favorite, crème brûlée.  My dad ordered the köfte for his appetizer and left his plate spotless. Torn between the Mediterranean Grill and the NY Strip and having expressed so to our waitress, my dad required guidance whereby she simply shrugged. And so my dad opted for the Mediterranean Grill. Unfortunately, his entrée was less than satisfactory. It included the very same red onion relish, the very same yogurt mint sauce, and the very same cous cous salad that my dad had just completed in his köfte appetizer. My dad addressed the repetition with our waitress to which she responded that she had never thought of telling him. The waitress did give us a free dessert as an apology, but the experience was disappointing for my dad nonetheless."}
{"text":"Went for a Valenine's Day dinner with a group of girlfriends. Started with the Crispy Almond-Crusted Calamari that comes with the Caper aioli & horseradish marinara. It was delish. Apparently, I was having some sort of seafood deprivation issue because I got the Seafood Trio as an entree. It came wih roasted fennels, artichokes and red potatoes/asparagus. It was very good. Scallops were not the best, but still very good. Oliver's is probably the best scallop dish I have tried in Madison so far. The shrimp and salmon were very good and all perfectly cooked. The fennels and artichokes were great in flavors and textures. It was a great experience overall. Definitely seemed more suitable for couples & seemed intimate. It was a very sweet touch that they gave all the women a red rose to celebrate the day of Cupid. Loved it. Would go back again when we can sit outside!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable dinner. Made reservations Late in the afternoon on yelp for one and they were waiting for me to arrive at 630.  Sometimes it is hard to get a reservation for one when traveling without sitting at the bar.  Dinner started with four perfectly cooked shrimp in the shrimp cocktail with homemade sauce.  Salad was good, excellent warm bread cane with it.  Ribeye was a perfect medium rare and the sautéed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes were excellent sides.  Vegetables crisp, not over cooked at all.  All in all a meal worth the price."}
{"text":"My, oh my, this place definitely deserves a perfect 5! Atmosphere was comfortable, service was absolutely impeccible, and the food - ohhh, the food. For starters, I enjoyed stuffed mushrooms and bruschetta. Cursed as I am with an allergy to shellfish, I wasn't able to try the crab cakes, oysters and shrimp that everyone else at my table raved about. My entree, salmon wrapped in grape leaves, was wonderful. And desserts were just as amazing. I shared the turtle cheesecake, but also sampled a molten chocolate cake that was divine. To round out our meal, Otto's wine list also had a number of good offerings. Also, if you judge a restaurant by the quality of their after dinner mints, Otto's are the best! You can't go wrong dining here."}
{"text":"Very good food - and reliably good.  Very nice staff and cozy atmosphere.  Check out their happy hour when they serve hors d'ouevres 1/2 off."}
{"text":"Wonderful suburban hangout. If only I had a place like this in ... Pint margaritas and nicely strong make for a wonderful evening. The local conversation made this place all the more entertaining. Started off with the Italian margarita - Amaretto ... and it comes in a pint. Awesomely strong. This is a good start. The bread basket is surprisingly good. I liked the crispy little puffs when I normally try to avoid the complimentary filler... I emptied my basket - darn it. My first course were the mussels and they were sucked down on the toast points. I would have liked the toast points to be thinner and doubled but taking half bites worked. The dish was a great combination and very tasty. I have never seen such PHAT muscles before. GMO or something. Either way I loved it. The complimentary green salad was non-descript micro-greens. Pretty fresh but they may be stocking more then they can use in a night. The innocent offer of another margarita was answered by the buzzed little voice of OK... a mistake. The Otto's maragarita seemed stronger then the Italian. The Italian really destroyed me for all other margaritas; the Otto seemed to be missing the Amaretto. Despite the absence, I still sucked it down... I really shouldn't have. The main of duck was DELICIOUS!!! I subbed the mashed potatoes for cous cous and the sauce came on the side. The cherry reduction was fantastic and wished I had more to dip in it. The duck was also moist and crispy if that is possible. Still half a margarita to go and contemplating calling Uber, I had to chug it before my chocolate truffle cake came. I have this stigma of not wanting cocktails tainting my chocolate... a port is best but I am already regretting the 2nd margarita. The truffle cake was super chocolatey but too hard. It was warm which is good but too hard. I was expecting more of a very thick mousse but the texture did not stop me from devouring the thin slice. Would love to come back and try the lamb."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Sat at the bar and service was great and the sampler platter was amazing! Then we had a nice couples meal at a table. Great experience overall. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Five stars across the board.  Awesome food , service, and environment.  The taste of the food was perfect and loved eating in an older style house.  Will recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Where the west was won.  Also, a patio worth pondering. Prices are steep but service is solid.  And the ambiance is interesting. Older crowds. Grandparents. But enjoyable for this gkjsnclforktnsndijrbethirty something."}
{"text":"Reliably good chill suburban \"fine dining\" that's not cheap but still not like what you'd be stuck paying in a big city. To me, Otto's is very much what makes sense for the west side if you don't feel like going downtown but still want something nice, and want an option besides steak, steak, steak, or a bunch of small plates at Eno Vino.   We were looking for somewhere to have a nice outdoor Friday night dinner on a particularly gorgeous evening, but chill and on the west side. Otto's delivered. Not the first time I've been here, but first time in a while. The patio is nice and there are enough trees to distract you from the nearby banks, office buildings, etc. I might go so far as to say that this is the best of the limited patio options on the west side.   You can get a pretty decent deal by going for the chef's tasting menu at 30 bucks per person with app, entree & dessert. We *almost* did that but the two entrees were fish and lamb chops. Both of them sounded appealing to me but my wife has this thing about not eating lamb, veal and other baby animals. I can get away with like, gyros or ground lamb kebabs in front of her but she kinda hates it if I order lamb chops. And I love lamb chops! Oh well. So we went for the regular menu instead.   She got the sea bass and I got the duck. Both entrees were solid. We got the mushroom caps as a starter and shockingly we ordered two desserts, the bread pudding and some chocolate gelato. If I were to critique anything, the mushroom caps portion could be a little larger, and the sides on the entrees could be a little more creative. But everything was tasty and very well cooked. My duck included both duck confit and duck breast. The breast could've been a touch closer to medium, but it definitely was not overcooked. Still tasted excellent.   With a couple drinks, and the admittedly not-very-big salads which come with the entrees, it was about $125 after tip. That's obviously not cheap and I'm not spending $100+ on dinner every weekend, but we both very much enjoyed our food, and the patio, and our server was excellent. She even brought me extra ice for my manhattan on the rocks that I was drinking perhaps too slowly, without me asking. And like I said, you can easily spend less than we did by doing the chef's tasting menu.   So I got to thinking, and really I've always been happy with my meals at Otto's, so maybe I'll pay a little more attention to it. It's a good spot. I just need them to come through with a chef's tasting menu that's not lamb next time I'm there with my wife."}
{"text":"Would be 4 stars but they charge $1.50 for rocks with my whiskey.  Food - great  Service - stellar considering we were a noisy party of 8  Bar - accommodating.  But again - $1.50 for rocks. Wow."}
{"text":"Their standards are so high! If you are looking for a good date night spot, this is it! The duck is amazing, steak is cooked to perfection, can't go wrong with anything. Nice wine list. The ambiance is romantic. Fairly priced. YUM!"}
{"text":"Great local spot!  Recommended by my old college roommate and he was right on the mark.  Great service, very nice people, great little bar downstairs and the food was excellent.  The sea bass was fantastic.  Their warm sourdough bread is fantastic.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone - I'm going back the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Yes it's an old house, yes it's been here a long time but...  Service is mediocre  Menu is nothing fancy  Food is sub par  I've tried it twice and will not be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner here tonight for my birthday and it was fantastic. We had not been here before, but it must be a popular place for birthdays because there were at least three other couples there for the same reason. Anyway, the service was great - always on top of water refills, everything came out in good time and we were checked on without being over bearing. I was a little worried because I have to eat dairy-free for my baby who is allergic to any milk protein, but they were very accomidating. The waiter actually informed me that the chef has a son who is allergic to dairy and gluten and therefore is very understanding and knowledgable of restricting these types of things. I was able to get the mixed grilled seafood dinner with a substitution for the pesto oil and it was excellent. We also had an appetizer of the shrimp wrapped in prosciutto and my husband got the filet with fries. The shrimp were fantastic and my husbands steak was cooked as asked to medium rare. The fries were just OK he said, so he would probably go with the mashed potatoes next time, but he still ate all of them. For dessert, I got a free one since it was my birthday and was thrilled that they had sorbet so I could actually eat dessert. The blackberry sorbet was an excellent way to finish a fabulous meal. My husband got the turtle cheesecake with intentions to bring some home, however, it was so good, that he ate the whole thing there instead.  This would probably make one of the top 8 meals I have had in Madison. I was worried because we are a younger couple and had gotten the impression that this restaurant was for an older crowd, but I did not feel the least bit out of place here. Definitely would recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Have only been here once for drink's and appetizers but everything was delicious and the bartender was super nice and helpful with food and drink recommendations.  They have a happy hour, I forget the drink specials but they had a menu with select appetizers heavily discounted. We tried the calamari and crab cakes (crab cakes were not a happy hour special). The crab cakes had a Middle Eastern taste to them and were a nice change from your regular old crab cake.  They do close relatively early. Sometimes we like to say out later and they close at 930 on weekends, that seems a little early to me. I think it's because they are on the Westside and the probably don't get much late night business. It also seems like they cater to an older crowd but nonetheless food and service we good enough to come back some time."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour. The New Zealand mussels were in a to die for white cream sauce  and they were really big and had calamari which was good. We only had appetizers but  entrees look good.. Not a lot of beers on tap but the ones they had were craft beers and were decent choices. Had a Edmund Fitzgerald on tap from Great Lakes Brewing company it was phenomenal!"}
