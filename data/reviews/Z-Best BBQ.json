{"text":"5 star all the way! How anyone can walk by the smokers is beyond me! Best ribs, corn bread and (collard) greens I. HAVE.EVER.HAD! With a freshman at PITT, we will be back. Oh did I mention rib dinner with two sides PLUS corn bread was $12.50? YUM!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Authentic taste, nice people, and the flare of a hard-working small business. Fully recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best ribs I've ever had.  I love the honey BBQ sauce.  Homey and clean atmosphere. Everyone is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We visited on a weekday afternoon,  the food was hot, fresh, and delicious. We had ribs (GREAT) , Mac n cheese (THE BEST) and green beans, they were good I'm not to crazy about garlic though. I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"The food is addicting. Such great BBQ. Smoked chicken wings are the. Eat I've ever had.  I could eat their food all day.  The sides are awesome too.  Get the greens...get lots of them, by far, the best I've ever had.  Wherever you are in Pittsburgh, come to this place for BBQ, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim today, and loved it. Great service, fabulous portion sizes, and the flavor was spot-on. We had wings with honey mustard sauce, ribs with original sauce, green beans (so good) and potato salad. Definitely on our list of WILL go again!"}
{"text":"This place has had many locations over the last few years and it appears they have finally settled here, a stone's throw away from Consol.

A no-nonsense BBQ joint. The only thing that may surprise you is how good the food is for the money. My favorite is the mac and cheese but all of their sides are solid, not to mention their mustardy-bbq sauce covered-ribs. If you're not yet familiar with this place, stop in and give it a try. You can't call yourself a Pittsburgh BBQ expert without stopping here first!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time I'd been to z-best since they were on Herron ave. Gotta say, nothing like I remembered. Got the rib dinner with greens and mac n' cheese. The sides were SOOOOO salty I had to force myself to eat even half of each. And the ribs must have been the last rack on the bottom of the pan, just sitting all during lunch rush, soaking in grease cause they were way too greasy. And worst of all, been in the bathroom all afternoon. It's hard for me to give a small establishment one star, but, it'd be even more difficult not to in thus case."}
{"text":"Horrible service... Food was disgusting... Will never go again literally had burnt dry ribs potato salad taste like onion juice the greens tasted like vinager...the Mac and cheese was ok chicken was burnt and inedible couldn't Chew..."}
{"text":"Very good bbq very tasty and close to all downtown locations for lunch or dinner very helpful staff"}
{"text":"I live a fair distance from the city, so anytime I do venture to downtown Pittsburgh, I make it a point to try something new. And babyyyy Z-best BBQ did not disappoint!! Met a friend for an early dinner, and I already knew I would love it just from the windows being steamy, when I first arrived (that means the chef clearly was putting in work lols). I got pulled pork with the sweetest honey mustard glaze. You could definitely tell it was homemade. Along with the pork, I had sides of mac &cheese, greens, and cornbread. All in all a good fulfilling meal. Customer service was A-1. I shall return. :)"}
{"text":"The ribs are oversized and fantastic.  We had mac & cheese and collard greens for our side dishes.  They were just as good as the ribs.  When we come to Pittsburgh we always make a point to stop here. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"So far I've tried :

BBQ Ribs : excellent
Chicken wings with honey mustard : delicious
Chicken thigh with honey mustard : devour that skin, so good
Cornbread : great
Sweet potatoes : great

I wasn't expecting much when I walked by and decided to go in.  Pleasantly surprised.

Very friendly fun staff too."}
{"text":"Never have I ever gotten such a bad case of food poisoning from a restaurant. Never eating here again, and I recommend that nobody else does either. Unless you want to get ridiculously sick. Just look look behind the counter, they clearly don't practice proper food safety precautions."}
{"text":"Amazing southern comfort food for an unbeatable price.  I got the BBQ wings with two sides  - the spicy mustard sauce the chef added was amazing.  The green beans taste exactly how they should, and the mac and cheese was creamy and delicious.  My boyfriend raved about the ribs and the cole slaw.  We can't wait to go back.  Would 100% recommend.  Just FYI, Not much room to sit inside, but there is some."}
{"text":"I'm very impressed with Z-Best; it's my current favorite in the Pittsburgh area. The ribs weren't pulled fresh out of a smoker, they were cut and sitting in sauce, but they were very tender, tasty, and the sauce is excellent. The chicken was perfect, smoky, moist, delicious. The sides also impressed me, the macaroni and cheese  was excellent with apparently a mix of several types of cheese, rich and flavorful, and the biggest surprise was the cabbage. I'm not a big fan of cabbage in general, but wow, you HAVE to try the cabbage here, sweet, delicate, buttery, and the perfect complement to bbq. Plus you don't have to feel as guilty eating ribs if you have some relatively healthy cabbage in the same meal!"}
{"text":"This is a great choice for lunch in Pittsburgh. The food is a little pricey but very worth it. They do have a lunch special."}
{"text":"I haven't actually eaten here, only ordered delivery, but it was delicious and I am looking forward to checking this place out for some more BBQ!

We had a craving for some wings during a football game and decided to try this place out. At first glance, we were a little disappointed that the wings seemed to be smoked rather than the typical crispy buffalo hot wings. As soon as I took a bite, my mind changed instantly! 

The meat was, as cliche as it sounds, falling off the bone and the flavor was amazing. You could put the wing in your mouth and pull all of the meat off by barely using your lips. The meat was smokey and juicy and we easily devoured the entire order."}
{"text":"Ordered a dozen fried wings, sweet potatoes and green beans.  I've never seen fried chicken so black and burnt looking.   The sides were great but the chicken appeared to have been deep fried in old oil or something.  I've never seen fried chicken look like that. The texture wasn't crispy so maybe they fry it different than most folks.  I have had ribs from here before and enjoyed them but the wings I would stay away from."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best ribs I've ever had. I felt like I was at a family reunion. Ribs off the grill/smoker. Incredible sauces. Killer sides. I did burn my mouth on the molten Mac & cheese, but that's my fault. I wish they had a hand-washing sink...cause them ribs are messy. I'll be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Seriously good BBQ! Some of the best BBQ sauce and mac-n-cheese I've ever had. Great cornbread, too. Very friendly staff as well. So glad my dad and I stopped in here for lunch before a show at PPG Paints Arena."}
{"text":"Used to live in Alabama, but hated BBQ. This place changes my mind. The ribs are meaty and moist. I tried the spicy sauce and that was good too. Tried the sides--sweet potatoes, potato salad, and cornbread. All were good. Friendly staff too. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is excellent you can truly tell a lot of heart and soul goes it to making it but unfortunately the heat and soul is missing from their customer service.We asked for a cup for tap water not only did they rudely say no they explained how giving out  cups for water was to expensive but don't worry you can buy a can of soda for $2.00."}
{"text":"Absolutely, hands down the best ribs I have had in Pittsburgh. The owners are really nice and the portions are huge. If you sit outside you can smell the smoker and it's incredible. I'm a Duquesne student and it's super close to campus."}
{"text":"Great little find,  right behind the consol energy building. A little mom and pop barbecue joint.  Small selection,  but everything they do. They do well. Great prices and fast service. Not much room to sit down. But over all a nice place!"}
{"text":"It's getting harder for me to want to leave Pittsburgh, mostly it has to do with the food and people. Z Best  takes the cake as being the best soul food in Pittsburgh. We had plans today to go and check out this other place for soul food, but my friend was told about Z Best by her friend. After she just mentioned great mac & cheese we quickly changed our plans to go. Once again only street parking with a meters. That's fine because when you smell the food from across the street you know it's worth it. Going in we met the owner Darla, a native of Pittsburgh that knows her way around a kitchen. The place is family operated, so I complimented Darla on having her Granddaughter work there. Darla is teaching her granddaughter responsibility, most young people don't have that anymore. When she found out it was our first time in there and our first time to Pittsburgh she wanted us to know good south cooking away from home. Darla let us sample everything on the menu. Off the sampling alone I wanted to marry Darla, that way I could eat her cooking everyday. As advertised the mac & cheese is phenomenal. There are little words to describe it, but masterpiece comes to mind. The pulled pork is never something I do, it's not a favorite of mine, but tasting Darla's I had to get some and she put cheese on it. The Yams were also out of this world good. Before I couldn't sit down and get some, you see my brother and my friend destroyed them (mostly my friend). I couldn't believe food this good existed outside New York. On top of all Darla's generosity, she gave me corn bread free of charge, normally it comes with a meal, but I order everything separately. Darla wanted me to try all her food and see what soul food was all about. I'm pretty sure I convinced her to deliver to New York, what's 400 miles! Anyone who reads this bookmark it or better yet just go. Trust me you don't need directions, let that down south cooking aroma guide you."}
{"text":"Wowzers.. this place makes some freakin good bbq. Came in from out of town and was at UPMC. Found this place on yelp and decided to stop in. They have street parking you have to pay for but easy to find a spot, at least during lunch time. I got the 1/4 chicken with bbq sauce. It was so good. Meat was tender and falling off the bone and the bbq sauce it was coated in was some of the best I have ever had. You get two sides with it and corn bread. Got sweet potatoes which were delicious and the Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was good but I've had better elsewhere so maybe next time, I would try a different side. Looking forward to coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because we could smell it near our hotel. Small joint, no real seating area except for two tables outside, but holy moly, great bbq for the price! The ribs had a nice smoked flavor and were amazing paired with their sweet bbq sauce, the wings are bbq smoked style, which means soft texture, not deep fried crispy (pairs better with bbq sauce as well).  Mac and cheese was a nice hearty cheezy baked style, and the potato salad was top notch.  Ordered it to go and ate it in the hotel. I would order another meal and take it home to New Jersey, but they are sadly closed on Sundays. Regardless, eat there!"}
{"text":"Wow, hit the spot ribs for a hungry crew.  The ribs are tasty, tender and moist and the sauce was good.  Had the sweet Sweet Potatoes and cheesy Mac & Cheese as sides...all very good.  The cornbread is some of the best I have every tasted...very moist and filling.  

The staff was friendly and helpful.   If you are looking for a good rib dinner you won't be disappointed.  There are two small tables outside and a couple of tables inside...we did take out."}
{"text":"This place is the spot if you want cheap good soul food. Great for College kids. Good size food and the managers nice"}
{"text":"The Best BBQ in PITTSBURGH
I have dined with Zbest as well as had their catering service. You cannot go wrong with them. The ribs and chicken were awesome! Well cooked fall off the bone meat and delectible sauces. The side dishes were all great especially the mac and cheese. You reall cannot go worng with any choice here. 

The catering order was fairly priced expertly cooked and delivered on time and with a smile. They threw in some tatsty extras that were very apprechated. The envy on the employees in the other departments was palitable and the smell of bbq stayed all day. They made my event a success. Thank you zbest."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! The mac n cheese is always amazing and the ribs are always perfect. Wings are also good. Owner took the time to correct an order grub hub screwed up. Never had a problem with the food, a great place to pick up lunch and excellent people working there!"}
{"text":"I've never had mac and cheese or wings this good. Takeout, service, AND food = A++++++++++ 

I HAVE to go back soon"}
