{"text":"I went for lunch, but it was a big mistake.  No menu items with a drink were under $14.  I think this place would be fine for dinner, but its not for lunch.  The food was good, but we were the only ones there, so it was quiet, and this was at noon.  

They need to either lower their prices to attract more lunch crowd, or move to a bigger place and offer an upscale diner.  Right now, I'm not sure they know their identity, and customers don't like to experiment either.  Get it figured out, or you will be gone in a few months, which would be a shame."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm going to warn you that the waitstaff and decor leave something to be desired. Those are the bad things. The food is EXCELLENT! Normally I cannot overlook bad service but the food really is exceptional. The food is so exceptional that this place deserves 5 stars. It is clean and the menu is well organized. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! The food is delicious, always fresh and always yummy! We have tried everything on the menu and can't decide what is our favorite. Being a vegan means you are limited a lot of times of where to eat but since this place is vegan (except desserts), we don't have to worry!"}
{"text":"A few years ago, if you had asked me to go to a vegetarian restaurant, I would have laughed.  I wasn't dragged, I went willingly, and I loved it.  The flavors were wonderful, and the combination of seasonings in the various dishes we tried were excellent.  We also split the Banana desert, delicious.  
Go for a change of pace, it's definitely unique"}
{"text":"Three of us went to Fresh Mint today for lunch.  We did not like it.  We started with an order of Summer Rolls.  Yuck, they were a piece of tofu and shredded cabbage rolled in rice paper, served with a thick, unappealing peanut sauce studded with raw peanuts. Presentation was nice, but it did not taste like anything except cabbage wrapped in rice paper.  My companions each ordered Pad Thai and I had the Five Spice Pho.  The Pad Thai arrived first. I looked at it and was very happy I did not order it.  It looked like a plate of gummy sauce-covered glop.  Tasted as bad as it looked. My Five Spice Pho looked delicious, but did not have any flavor.  Adding the hot sauce that is served on the side, only added heat, but no flavor.  The broth tasted like water.  We did like the Mint Lemonade, but at $3.95 a glass, it was pretty pricey.  Our lunch bill came to $44.  Very expensive for what we were served.

Needless to say, I am crossing Fresh Mint off my list.  No reason to go back.  I gave it 2 stars out of respect for the Yelpers that think it is so great, but actually, I would rather give it one.  Vegetarian does not have to be bland and tasteless."}
{"text":"Rarely will I write a negative review but my experience tonight at Fresh Mint makes it necessary. I have dined here three times prior, all during relatively quiet hours. Tonight, when dining with my family, the restaurant was slammed. I understand that they are a small, family-run joint, but something's gotta give!  My gripe is not with the food but with the service and the owner's poor attitude. During previous visits, he has been able to run the dining room on his own, but tonight he was completely in the weeds. 

To start, they were out of their imperial rolls, which I really enjoy. The owner was apologetic but was also completely harried by his other tables and could barely finish a sentence without being called to another set of patrons. We had a last minute addition to our table when another family member called to say he'd be joining us. We placed orders for appetizers and soup until he was able to make it to the restaurant, but the owner seemed annoyed with our table anyway. 

There was also a large party in the dining room from what seemed to be a radio show that advertises for this restaurant (one of the hosts interrupted our meal to give us a flyer about it) and those patrons were loud and after finishing their meals, hovered other tables to chit-chat. It was quite distracting. 

The restaurant itself is tremendously loud and they play upbeat music from the 50's and 60's. This soundtrack would be fine during a lunch rush but not when people are trying to enjoy a quiet dinner with their families. 

As for the food, it's adequate. A-OK, even. But the prices are outlandish and the service is unpleasant. We will not be returning as there are many fine, veg-friendly establishments in the city deserving of our business."}
{"text":"From a friendly waiter, to excellent vegetarian food (I'm not vegetarian), to reasonable rates.  This place delivers!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good, and there is a lot of variety. I love the mushroom wonder and the vegetarian citrus spare ribs, and I always get the Thai iced tea to go with. Many of the meals come with a nice-sized serving of vegetables, so I leave feeling full but not with that heavy feeling.

The owner is friendly and helps make people feel comfortable in the restaurant. I have brought many initially unwilling meat eaters here who ended up really enjoying their food. I gave it four stars because some of the dishes are a little pricey, but I will keep coming back when I want a healthier meal at a friendly place."}
{"text":"My husband and myself can never say enough good about this restaurant.
It is the only vegan place we choose to dine in and is always consistent in its excellence.
Run by the owners who are there to speak with you.
We always love going there and are never disappointed.
Sara & Michael H"}
{"text":"Meat lover converted!!

I agreed to go to Fresh Mint only to satisfy the vegetarian love of my life.  As I am sure most carnivores would expect, I was prepared to eat unfamiliar veggies and soy products drowned in disguising sauces.  But to my surprise, IT WAS THE BEST MEAL I HAD EATEN IN MONTHS!!  I'm not kidding meat lovers, if all vegetarian dishes tasted as good as this, I would convert immediately.  I had the Soy Ginger Chicken, Black Pepper Beef and the 5 spice soup.  The only thing more beautiful than the dishes that arrived, was the woman I was dining with.  Perfect presentation, great texture, flavorful and yes, fulfilling!  I will DEFINITELY continue to eat there, especially when I'm looking for healthy food choices."}
{"text":"My ball and chain has been training for a half marathon and therefore, I have been suffering the onslaught of veggies and non-fried fare. So let's just say I wasn't thrilled at his choice for lunch. 

And then I ate my words. And my veg. 

We started with the summer rolls and they were yummy. I didn't miss the meat at all. The peanut dipping sauce was tasty, although a little thick... which was actually nice. I had the Pad Thai as an entree and the salad that came with it was super fresh and tasty. I usually like my salad served with a side of lettuce and enough other junk to qualify it as not so healthy (hello, blue cheese!). This salad was good and it didn't leave me missing anything. The Pad Thai wasn't as spicy as I usually like, but the broccoli on top made up for it. Ryan had the Chicken and veg. Well, the SOY chicken and veg. I couldn't help but crack a joke about what I like to have when I'm craving some chicken.... actual chicken. I have to admit the soy chicken was good and the texture was stellar. His had more spice and was super tasty. 

Top it off with a hot cup of Jasmine tea and I was happy. 

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"very disappointed with my experience here, i came back because i loved it the first time i came. the food was SO delicious, the staff was friendly and helpful, but today? not so much as a \"how do you like your food?\" first i come in and get a menu with about half the stuff i remember on there but i think anything of it. i got the pad thai which i didn't end up liking too much and ended up just eating the veggies, i was planning on asking to swap it out once i heard the man tell another customer there was kung pow chicken (which was not on the menu i saw) but no one ever came to ask how anything was and i was starving so i ate the veggies. i'm not too sure i'll be returning even though the summer rolls were delicious. i just didn't feel like my service was as valued as the other customers which were checked on multiple times. after not touching my food for ten minutes the check the waiter asked if i wanted a box and i said, \"no i didn't really like it.\" and he didn't say anything. sad because it was so good the first time and there aren't a lot of vegetarian restaurants near my house :("}
{"text":"The food is always great, and I love their lemonade. But wait time during lunch is an issue. If there's only two of us, or God forbid it's just me, I often feel like the owner finds it a burden to seat me. Not a good impression."}
{"text":"Great tastes!  I like their spicy moc-beef dish.  I've had their cake and other desserts.  The food is really exceptional.  The only thing I don't like about their food is their vegetables; they're just steamed.  No sauces, no light oil or lemon juice.  It's broccoli and some squash -- they're steamed perfectly but they just lack taste.  It's really a downer to get a great entree with such dismal vegetables.  And, since they're barely enough sauce with the meats you can't hardly dip the veggies in the sauce.

The service is really odd.  I don't know how else to describe it.  It's not bad service, but it really could use some polishing. I was there today and one gentleman was talking so loudly as he was working that you could hear him complaining about this or that.  He really could sharpen up his wait techniques and cut out about 50% of what comes out of his mouth.  I also can't get out of there in an hour.  I called in an order, was told about 10 minutes and didn't leave until nearly 40 minutes after I called in the order.  It was Valentine's Day but they weren't that busy.

But, I'll keep coming back because the main entree is always excellent (sans the sides).  I just wish the environment and service matched the prices."}
{"text":"Having heard many fantastic reviews, I was eager to make the 40 minute trek from Old Town to Fresh Mint for some delicious vegetarian food. However, after my experience, I can confidently say that I wouldn't come back to this restaurant even if it were 5 minutes away. To begin, the place was empty and our server was sitting at a table reading a book when we walked in. She seemed peeved that we were there, and dropped the menus on the table without a single greeting. After taking our order (pad thai and colorful vegetables) she went behind the counter and played on her phone for the entire duration of our visit. Not fantastic service. In terms of the food: The sauce in both dishes was too sweet to eat, and the food was just bland and lacked flavor. I had to yell across the restaurant to get my server's attention for sriacha, and when she brought it to the table, there was only a teaspoon of sriacha in the ramekin. Now, I frequent many restaurants and I myself work in the industry, so I know what good food and good service is. Fresh Mint lacked in both of these areas. It's a shame."}
{"text":"Before I even took my seat outside I was greeted with a menu and silverware. And before i even opened the menu i got ice water and so did my dog! Who joined me for lunch on the patio. The interior was very inviting with it's shades of green, and A/C. But I choose outside on green furniture. Not just patio furniture but wooden chairs and good tables. But if my shirt was any thinner I would have splinters in my back. The wooden chairs are worn from the weather outside.

I placed my order for the golden soy chicken delight. It was delicious. Chicken was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside a perfect portion or excellently cooked veggies. Broccoli, squash, peppers, and cauliflower. And my choice of jasmine or brown rice chose jasmine and it was good.
Dessert and mint flavored drinks were tempting but I just had my meal and water and walked out for under twelve bucks.
The reason I am giving it a 4 instead of five was the splintery chairs and patio floor needs to be pressure washed."}
{"text":"delicious!
super friendly, good service.  vegan-tastic."}
{"text":"Vegans and Vegetarians alike should find plenty of options here! My daughter and I shared a large bowl of Lemongrass Soup plus an order of Pad Thai. Both were beautifully presented, generous and delicious. I will be back next time I am in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great place for vegetarian cuisine. The food is always fresh and the prices are reasonable. The service is a bit slow but friendly, nevertheless."}
{"text":"We are not vegetarians nor vegans, but we enjoyed a superb lunch at Fresh Mint and will certainly return for another. Owner/server was very friendly. Food was fantastic. And, as you will see in most of our reviews, our well-behaved dog was welcomed on their patio dining."}
{"text":"Our all time Favorite Vegetarian Restaurant in The Valley. Best for PickUp or Delivery as In-House Dining is quite small and regulars LOVE this place. However, keep in mind, locale and general area does not do this fabulous, healthy, and exotic Asian Cuisine justice! Food is Amazing. GLUTEN FREE Options available.

Dishes can be customized if you are patient and very specific. This is a Family Owned and Operated Establishment.

Services like MEAL MAN will PickUp/Deliver your food, if in their Delivery Zone."}
{"text":"I have been coming here a long time but I don't feel comfortable returning because I am put off by the owners harsh demeanor. I don't have time to deal with his nasty attitude. The wife is so lovely and sweet but her husband is going to run this business into the ground. It's a real shame because the food is good and healthy even though the prices are pretty outrageous.There just aren't enough healthy restaurants in the area. I wish he would take these reviews about the bad customer service into consideration and change his attitude or hire a manager if he doesn't like working in the service industry. Attitude is everything and although the food is descent I don't want to have to feel like i am burdening someone to take my order. Sorry guys I hope you fire your husband or the business will fail."}
{"text":"If I had to describe this place in one word, that word would be \"AWESOME.\" Really stretching my vocab there, huh? My inability to muster clever language at 6 am aside, this place really is great. I'm always on the lookout for good vegetarian places and this one was no disappointment. 

I was in Scottsdale, AZ for the weekend visiting some relatives and my mom and I decided to try this place for lunch (after I had found it using the \"nearby\" search function of Yelp. And guess what? There was another group dining while we were there and we overheard them say they also found the place on Yelp. Fresh Mint needs one of those stickers on the front door that says \"People Love Us On Yelp.\"

Like I said, this place is vegetarian and probably 90% vegan. So vegans, be not afraid. I ordered the Mushroom Wonder and a bowl of the Vietnamese Hot and Sour Soup, and my mom ordered the Rainbow Wonder with Vegetable soup in a garlicy broth. Both were delish. And from looking over the menu I surmised there probably wasn't a dish that wasn't tasty. Everything looked so good.

This place is mid-priced. Not cheap as dirt, but the food was worth every penny. The owner was super friendly and the atmosphere was clean, fresh, and inviting. My ONLY knock on this place and maybe the reason I didn't give it a 5th star, is that the service was slow. Quite slow. They could probably use another staff member or two during peak hours, but it was just the husband and wife owners and one other employee for Saturday lunchtime. If you're on the go and really need something quick - you're probably better off hitting up the Subway next door. But if you have some time to sit down and enjoy and great lunch or dinner, Fresh Mint is THE place!"}
{"text":"Keep in mind we drove here from Gilbert. When we arrived around 2:15 there was a piece of notebook paper on the door that said they were closed for lunch. I asked the man working when they'd be open and why they randomly closed because it didn't state it on their website. He told me that the workers were tired and they needed a break. He was not apologetic, sincere or friendly at all. It would've been one thing if he gave more of an explanation, but apparently we were just another dollar to him. We drove 45 minutes to get told they were closed for an unmarked lunch break and to be treated poorly. The food looks good on the website but there is equally as good food with much better customer service. Will never attempt to eat here again, there are plenty of other phenomenal restaurants that carry ALL vegan food along with impeccable service: 
The loving hut
The Green
24 carrots
Pomegranate cafe"}
{"text":"From a non-vegetarian. Very good, had some nice curry, I'd come back. 

Was reluctant but they won me over!"}
{"text":"This food was so very bland. Ordered lemongrass tofu and found a miniscule piece of it in the bland dish. Big chunks of tofu and steamed vegetables is not tasty. I've had delightful vegan food, but this was truly boring and quite overpriced, even for its location. I used to eat here a couple of years ago and remember the food having some flavor and even some interesting flavored, but not tonight. 

I'm not sure why anyone would call this the best food they've eaten."}
{"text":"I love this place, i've gotten a lot of people who aren't vegetarian to come here and they love it too.

The soy chicken delight and kung pao chicken are my favorite. Their desserts are extremely yummy and their drinks are really great too. Try the mint lemonade or the thai ice tea. 

It can be hard being vegetarian and having the option to eat anything but veggie sandwiches and burgers, pasta or pizza when going out. This place is consistent with their food and the owners are extremely friendly.

Even if you aren't vegan or vegetarian the food tastes great and is definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Not really sure what all the hype is about. Food was pretty bland. We ordered the following: Tofu fresh spring rolls - there was literally ONE strip of tofu ...finger size circumference inside and filled to the gills with veggies - veggies were fresh though. Papaya salad - the most blandest dish - almost like jicama salad, just a bunch of veggies with a dash of lime juice. Lemongrass tofu curry - this was the better of the three but still mediocre. Would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place because it was close to my hotel while I was on business.  I couldn't believe my luck!  Everything I ordered was delicious.  I ordered the citrus spare ribs, which were so good that I ate the leftovers at the airport the next morning (that's saying something, for a business traveler!), and the lemongrass noodle soup, which was so generously portioned (and packed perfectly for takeout so the noodles didn't get mushy) and amazingly flavorful!  The broth was to die for and I'm usually a little underwhelmed by pho broth.  I also went a little crazy and ordered the autumn rolls, which were fresh and tasty.  I live in NYC and wish I had this place near my home!  I will definitely return here for the delicious food and friendly service when I'm back in the area!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here and had a pleasant experience. I had the Kung Pao Soy Chicken lunch special for $8.00. It was not only freshly prepared and delicious but had generous portions that included salad and brown rice. I had the Iced Thai coffee as well that was just as tasty. 
The owner was friendly. The service was good even through a busy lunch rush. I will go back to try other items."}
{"text":"The food is average.  Husband liked it, hence the three stars.  Not the cleanest place.  Biggest criticism is everything in the restaurant is green, like Oz green.  Not appealing."}
{"text":"The fried imperial rolls and the fried rice are pretty good. The last time I went in there the guy told me that there are a few of their items that arnt actually vegan, so if you are looking for something vegan make sure you ask. Its not the best vegan food ive had, but its still pretty good!!"}
{"text":"The food is okay here, the kung pao and spring rolls are my favorite.  We have always ordered to go from here and have been pretty happy with it for the most part. 

I was telling my sister she needed to come try it with us so we decided to dine in last night! Worst mistake! Service is HORRIBLE.  I think it may have just been the owner who was taking orders, but he was slow, and very unfriendly.  I felt unwelcome the moment we sat down.  They also need to hire more cooks because the food took forever to come out.  My boyfriend actually got up TWICE to refill his own drink because our \"waiter\" never came back to ask if we needed more. Also paying was about a 15 minute process as well.  

It was definitely a let down.  I might have returned here for the take out, but since the atmosphere was so unfriendly I think I'll just stay away from now on.  

I'll stick with green and loving hut for dining out veg."}
{"text":"Wow! Did not expect this place to be so neat! And delicious! Super friendly people, literally catered to exactly what I wanted! Super pleased with this place and will be back! Yum"}
{"text":"Fresh Asian cuisine with a Hawaiian influence. Family owned and loved. This place is beautiful. The vibes are excellent and hospitality is very accommodating. 
You are in for a healthy treat with Fresh Mint. 
You have to get the imperial rolls! 


Took my sister here to eat, and she ordered the lemongrass tofu with a Thai iced tea. I had the pad Thai with an 8 on the spicy scale! It was super!

Thank you Fresh Mint"}
{"text":"I see that other people here have had a similar experience as myself. The food is well-prepared, but it's nearly imposssible to get service! When I was there, I saw only 5 other people in the place. There were two waiters, and the owner, and the cook in the kitchen. I had to get up out of my seat to get noticed. The wait staff just stood there are stared at the ceiling. What? Not ever glancing over at the customers. 
When I paid my check, the owner NEVER came back with my change. I had to get up (again) and ask for my change. He didnt even remember I paid him. Again, the place was not crowded. The food is average. Certainly not better than what I can prepare at home!"}
{"text":"I would recommend the Fresh Mint higher than five stars if I could. I had the Phad Thai noodle and their cucumber rolls with peanut sauce. Everything was amazingly fresh, hot, and delicious.

I actually had to think twice about the fact that there was no meat in the dish because normally I would've ordered the noodles with chicken, but I didn't miss it a bit because everything was so flavorful. 

The founder of the company and his wife are the manager and cook at this location. This makes for a even better experience because you can talk with Mike, the owner, about the place and he obviously knows everything."}
{"text":"This is honestly such a great place to eat. Even if you're a huge fan of meat, come here with a health-conscious friend and enjoy some flavorful food. Everything they have is so tasty and good for you, the restaurant is a nice type of small and the husband of the chef (aka the owners) is the server most of the time. (Speaking of the chef, she's Vietnamese and makes a killer Pho) But really, you can't go wrong with their menu, and their smoothies and coffee are so worth. Everything is fresh and cooked to order.

Even though no one cares, my personal favorite is their pad thai and vegetable spring rolls:)"}
{"text":"Disappointing after high reviews. The pad thai was not what is usually is. The veggies included squash and was not diced and incorporated into the noodles. Meanwhile there was almost no peanut sauce. The green papaya salad was healthy tasting, but also on the cheap."}
{"text":"I love this place! The owner is so friendly and accommodating! He goes out of his way to provide good service. The food is so yummy too! I believe his wife is the chef but whoever it is works magic! I'm a recent plant food advocate trying to be a better vegetarian and I love the selection! It makes me so happy to know that I'm eating healthy and saving a few animals along the way...or at least not munching on them (that's just me). Even if you like meat though, you'll appreciate the great flavors. Lots of options and the faux stuff will satisfy you - I guarantee it. I can't wait to try something new next time I go. 
P.S. The thai ice tea is my favorite! Oh and be sure to try the fried imperial rolls- they're so good!"}
{"text":"I went here a while ago and forgot to write a review.  It was ok but not great.  The atmosphere was very sterile, food was good and service was ok.  I was glad we weren't in a rush as the service definitely wasn't fast.  I would go back again and give it another try."}
{"text":"My first visit will be my last.  I met a friend and we had to wait 10 minutes just to be acknowledged and get a water.  Then had to literally beg for a refill...I had to walk to the kitchen myself to ask for more.  It took 30 minutes to get our order taken and then another 20 to get the food...horrible!  The owner was running around crazily being that he was short handed but there is still a minimum of courtesy and professionalism that should be given.  We were just given the shoulder shrug and look of craziness.  Not a way to handle new customers.  The food was below average."}
{"text":"Having lived in San Francisco, where I used to go to vegetarian/Asian restaurants I expected something with a more flavor. Ordered Golden Curry for lunch, and it was very bland, with a slight rancid oil taste in it. No coconut milk or curry flavor in it. There were only two small cubes of tofu in this serving. The brown rice was OK, and the salad average.
The wait for the food was long, and also to get the check.
It would help to have some ready made food for the lunch hour, but according to their website they prepare everything at the time of the order. This might be good for many other dishes on the menu, but a curry gets better when prepared beforehand, and sits a little bit to deliver more flavor......"}
{"text":"Thought this would be a cute cafe for lunch. It is only asian no other choices on the menu. Ordered appetizers to start as this is my first time here. I am vegetarian as I do occasionally eat eggs and cheese but this place did not impress. I ordered the kabobs and they were saturated in a thick sauce that smelled burnt as if they scalded it while cooking. It was thick like ketchup ruining the point of fresh vegetables. My friend ordered the cucumber rolls and they were just a sliver of cucumber with a huge chunk of unseasoned tofu and a carrot and maybe a radish sliver. There was another very heavy peanut sauce on the side. My friend said the flavor of the peanut sauce was ok but the rolls needed some flavor and sauce heavy for the dish. Unfortunate because I would love to find a nice vegan place close to home. Will stick to true food, green or loving hut."}
{"text":"Delicous, original and quaint. Small business run makes it feel personal. I recommend it to anyone looking for cheaply priced, 100% vegetarian or vegan, Asian style food. Double thumbs up! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Family friendly restaurant with outstanding vegetarian and vegan food. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the food is consistently good. There are a wide variety of selections and both appetizers and entrees are generous. I've never been there when there wasn't an owner present, seating guests, taking orders, checking on the food, cooking the food, putting together take out orders. Everything is handled with excellence and you get the impression that they really care about their guests and the food they serve. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! We love going to Fresh Mint. Always good. We have tried numerous dishes and every time it just gets better and better. If you work around the area, their lunch specials are affordable and taste amazing as well. Oh and if you want dessert, try their Mango Tapioca. Wow wow wow! Oh and we aren't vegetarians but Fresh Mint is just too good to not go to when we are in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Let me start out by simply stating: the food here is incredible.
Completely unique and delicious. They do have things you have heard of before, of course (Kung Pao SOY chicken and Golden Curry Vegetables) but I'm a regular here and have tried many dishes and I can safely say it is done in a way that has never been done before.
This place is a far jump from fast food. If you are looking for typical, greasy, mediocre Chinese food, you won't find it here; nor will you find a run-of-the-mill salad bar.
As corny as it sounds...Fresh Mint lives up to its name: everything tastes fresh! The dishes are extremely flavorful as well as a work of art. Everything is very pretty and thoughtfully laid out. You can tell the owners and employees put care into their food display--this is a family owned restaurant so from what I've seen, they certainly put pride into their work.

Your experience is not over once you leave. The feeling afterward is another experience in itself. I have never felt heavy or unhealthy OR guilty after eating here! I feel light and nourished.

I highly recommend this place to anybody, especially if you're looking for something new, special and unique. It's very green (the walls' colors make you want a fresh salad, I think they did it on purpose), the owners are friendly and most of all, the food is SOOOO amazing. After writing this review, I find myself craving some more of their food!

*OH and another thing: you CAN make reservations, that thing up there is wrong saying you can't (I've brought in many parties before).*"}
{"text":"Best veg food in Phoenix - my boyfriend and I are addicted to the five spice noodle soup! Also, the mint lemonade is incredible! The owner is always kind and gracious and the food is super fresh, and feels good to eat."}
{"text":"Authentic asian inspired vegan food. There's nothing else like it in the area. Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Fresh Mint last night.  We ordered a delicious green salad, eggplant curry & pad thai.  

The salad had a very light and flavorful citrus dressing, walnuts, cranberries, apples, etc...   I wish the portion was a little larger for $9, but it was very tasty.  

The pad thai had nice fresh veggies and was very good, but the curry was much better.  It was a little spicy, which I like, and was very flavorful.  It wasn't a coconut milk curry (or had very little) so it was a little different from most Thai green curries I've had, but I loved it. 

I definitely would go back to Fresh Mint.  The food was great and I like supporting family owned/operated restaurants, which are scarce in north Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"This place was solidly good. My husband and I ate here when passing through Scottsdale. We actually saw the sign and pulled over because we realized how hungry we were. 

We shared autumn rolls, which were cut up like sushi. They were quite fresh and the sauce was good.

We each had an item from the lunch express menu. I had the Eggplant with Basil and he had the Mongolian Soy Beef. Both came with brown rice and a salad. I really liked the portions - they were just right. The eggplant was wonderfully tender and the dressing on the salad was tasty. 

The only downsides were that service was a little slow (though quite friendly) and my husband thought the water had a bad smell/taste and he couldn't drink it.

If we are in Scottsdale again, we'll go back."}
{"text":"The food is really good and consistent.  Love that this isn't a chain restaurant! Who would've thought I could eat Pho soup again as a vegetarian? Even if you aren't a veggie, you will find something here to love."}
{"text":"This time I tried the sweet and sour soup and it was amazing! I still had to wait 30 min but it was worth it this time. Amazing flavors and spices! 

I also tried the soy beef (don't know exact name) and it was actually great but wish there was more meat to veggie to rice ratio. 
Will be back!"}
{"text":"Hello Awesome! We drove literally 25 minutes to try this place out because we heard there was a new thai/veg place in town...25 minutes but I was impressed!

Walking in, I couldn't help but notice the bright green walls and the cheerful atmosphere. We were seated and ordered the fried spring rolls. So good! My friend order the Golden Soy Chicken and I had the Curry Veggies w/ tofu. We've eaten at Veggie House and we were impressed with their soy-meat fare but I was blown away with Fresh Mint. The soy-chicken dish was amazing, not a weird texture but just right. The sauce that goes with it was mighty tasty. My Curry Veggies were kickin! I loved the curry and both meals came with steamed veggies and brown rice (YUM!). 

Our bill came to about $28 with iced teas. Overall, a very pleasant experience. Now, can they get one over in my area?...that would be clutch."}
{"text":"Yelp is right, 'Vegetarians go nuts for this spot' and they should.  I was told the Fried Imperial Rolls were the most popular roll so I tried it and was slightly disappointed.  Mainly the texture wasn't what I was expecting but then again what did I think they were going to do with a Taro Root.  

Then, the Spicy Lemongrass Noodle Soup.  I was told I wouldn't be disappointed and it's HIGHLY recommended.  Let me first say, it was 104 outside, the ground was hot and the air was hotter and this Northerner is considering getting soup and to continue melting? As scared as I was about the heat on heat bidness, I had to get it.  The flavors were on point. This may be in the upper end of the top 3 Asian Soups I've had.  

The service was solid, the server was patient and provided great service. The place was clean, had a nice ambiance of a hidden mom n' pop spot and the prices were reasonable.  5 stars.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"In town to visit family, and we went to Fresh Mint for lunch. First off, the decor is a bit \"in your face.\" Bright and odd. The \"strip mall\" references made by other reviewers are accurate. 

Service was S.L.O.W. until the man, who I think owns the restaurant, showed up to save the day. Still, it took a long time to get our food. 

We shared the summer rolls, which I think were below average. The wrappers were a bit mushy and I found the rolls to lack flavor. We also got some fried rolls (can't remember the name, but they had yucca root in them... Imperial Rolls maybe?) and they were pretty tasty. 

I ordered the Spicy Lemongrass Tofu lunch special. The salad was average \"bag\" salad, but I liked the dressing - flavorful with a kick. The tofu was yummy - in a curry coconut milk sauce - but it was ONLY tofu. I actually love tofu, but I was hoping for a few veggies. I would not order this again w/o requesting they add some broccoli or something. Just too rich of a dish for my taste. My brother got the kung pao chicken which looked Delicious. My husband had pad thai, which was pretty good. 

This place was definitely expensive. I was surprised, visiting from the Bay Area, that prices at this place, which resembles a semi-fast food establishment, were so high. Lunch for 6 of us was almost $100."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to visit Fresh Mint--I've been missing out! Everything from the service to the food was excellent. We were greeted by the friendliest staff; the owner (I think) treated us like we were guests in his own home, such a delight. I ordered the Pad Thai lunch special and it was delicious. What a relief not having to worry about whether or not my meal is vegan. I'll definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Phoenix for a conference and asked Yelp for help on a good vegetarian restaurant. We were not disappointed with Fresh Mint.

We started with the spring rolls (I think it was the Afghan rolls...can't quite remember) and they were better than average.

We shared two entrees. Pho and the Kung Pao Chicken. The Kung Pao Chicken was astonishing good and just this dish will give this restaurant a 5-star rating in my book. It may be one of the top 5 dishes I've ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  The food was extremely bland and lacking in distinctive flavor.  We had four dishes:  (1) kung pao \"chicken.\"  The fake chicken was very chewy and didn't have any chicken flavor.  There was no heat (spice) whatsoever in the dish.  I have had vegetarian chicken kung pao elsewhere that was delicious.  This was not.  (2) Eggplant with basil and tofu.  Small amounts of tofu that looked like crinkle cut fries.  Minimal basil flavor.  Minimal spice.  (3) Mushroom wonder.  This dish was a tad better.  Meaty mushrooms and sauteed onions along with the vegetables.  The \"special\" sauce was somewhat sweet and not at all special.  (4) Vegetable chow mein.  My friend opted for the soft noodles.  It was essentially soup.  I don't understand how chow mein can come out in a bowl of broth.  She did seem to like it.  My husband pronounced it bland.  Also the food did not come out particularly hot and got cold very quickly.  

We had the coconut tapioca for dessert.  I haven't had it before so can't compare it to other versions but it was ok.  

Yes, the food is expensive for what you get but I would gladly pay it if the food was good.  This food is not worth your time or money unless you will only eat at a vegan restaurant and insist on going out."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! I had high hopes for the Yellow Curry and the Lemongrass soup. Sadly, both were tasteless. The soup tasted like water.  Really no sense of lemongrass in the spoonful of soup. The curry smelled abd looked beautiful.  Again, not any flavor detected. 
My daughter had a noodle in her lemonade ans I asked for a new spoon twice. Very dirty utensils and dishes"}
{"text":"Friendly welcome. 
Clean bathroom. 
Quick turnaround on the appetizer. 
We had the Kung Pao Soy Chicken and the Soy Fish entrees. Both were top notch! Worth the short wait. 

We'll definitely return next time we're in the area. :)

*note: the soy fish dish was on the saltier side according to my taste buds. On our drive home I definitely felt the \"salt\" in my body.  Now, we usually eat a low-sodium diet so your taste buds may differ in opinion. 

Happy eating! :)"}
{"text":"The best curry I have found in Arizona!!
My daughter and I stopped in for lunch today and Wow!! What a great place! She had the pad Thai and I had the golden curry. I am serious, it is the best I have had in the 7 years I've lived here! We will be back soon! Great service also!!"}
{"text":"Try the lemonade with mint.  yummmm!     The food is very fresh, but depending on what you're looking for ......it's more asian than vegetarian in my opinion."}
{"text":"We have dined at Fresh Mint twice now and both times we've had a very good dining experience. The food is well prepared and prices are reasonable. The owner is the chef and her husband waits the tables. He could use a few lessons on waiting tables. He is a bit harsh, and he clearly does not like to be asked questions. He is not a draw for new business and probably would be better off staying behind the counter. The food however is as good as any vegetarian restaurant that I've even dined at. Flavored nicely with a wonderful variety. We will go back to sample more dishes. they accept reservations which is great because the place is so small. The salads are incredible as are the soups."}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place. I call in to make an order for pickup so I can quickly grab it and go back to work. I ordered the cucumber rolls and the lotus salad. The lady on the phone told me it would take about 10 minutes. So I drove 15 minutes to the location to find that they never started on my order.. okay no big deal it's a pretty easy thing to prepare. Nope. I ended up being there for almost 30 minutes. While the staff argued back and forth about what my order actually was. It wasn't until the woman who took my order finally told them what it was. So after all that I received my order. Definitely not worth the 30ish minute wait. Food was okay. That's it. Nothing special. Portions were not that great for the 15 bucks I paid.

Maybe it was a bad day not sure. But it wasn't really handled properly. 

I might try it again. Not sure."}
{"text":"As part of a group (5 people) we each ordered different dishes and from the appetizers and soups to the mains...each of us were impressed not only with the flavors but also the plating.  Presentation was very nice and not at all what we expected from a place in a strip mall.  Service was good not great but they were very nice and so I would rather focus on the quality of the food and the willingness they had to deliver great meals.  At one point we ordered another autumn roll and they immediately got that out so we didn't end up with mains and that... we all agreed this is a place to go back to.
Even the meat eaters loved the selection-"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant one evening while we were visiting Scottsdale and we are glad we did. The food is sooooo good. We started with the summer rolls that came with a peanut sauce. The rolls were a perfect size to share and the sauce was delicious. I had the vegetable chow mein. I loved the fresh flavor of this dish. My husband had the vegetarian citrus spare ribs OMG it was good! We were seated right away (we were the only ones there). After we ordered customers started coming in and I could see they might be a little shorthanded. They did have a sign posted on the door that they close promptly at 8. My husband and I both left there saying that we wish they had a location in Tucson so we could try everything on the menu. This will be a place we stop to eat whenever we are in the area. If you are looking for fresh, healthy and delicious food this place is for you :-)"}
{"text":"Great $8 lunch menu. Had the pad thai - was very well balanced and delicious. Meal portions were reasonable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the quality of food at Fresh Mint. I'm not vegetarian. Truth be told, I don't always eat healthy when dining out. However, I was blown away. The food was delicious, fresh, and hearty. While I left full, I didn't have that \"I hate myself\" feeling. The owners, Michael and Mai have created something unique that they should be proud of. I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Rare vegetarian restaurant in Phoenix.  The food is very  good and fresh. Service is a little slow but worth it. I had the lemon grass tofu which was fragrant and delicious.  Carnivore husband was very impressed with his mock Kung pao chicken ."}
{"text":"BACK STABBED - THIS FOOD IS NOT FOR VEGGIES OR VEGANS !! 

\"This is NOT for the extremely high prices for the food.\"

These people are adding eggs in their cakes and other items and serves along vegan dishes. They asked us to try some vegan desserts after main course and we ordered carrot cake (they did not tell us this before that they had eggs in it)

I heard somebody talking and asking ingredients and I also asked and then they disclosed. I was seriously annoyed with this service. When I asked owner why the hell they are serving this nonsense cakes to cheat on customers, and he explained proudly that they are kosher and no vegan bakeries in Scottsdale, AZ!! I explained two times that why cake is so important!  Can't they serve vegan desserts apart from cake s if they are not available, in a vegan restaurant and he could not understand or accept it.

I see a clear strategy to make couple of more dollars on every order without notifying customers in the name of cakes having eggs.

BEWARE THIS IS NOT A VEGAN RESTAURANTS IT HAS ANIMAL INGREDIENTS IN MANY OF THEIR ITEMS!!!

I had drunk lots of salt with hot water later on and had 3-4 vomits after it by manually inserting fingers in my throat to clean my stomach.

NEVER VISIT AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Mission Statement Revealed: YES, We Have NO Bananas.

Eight month's ago, I was told by the chef's husband/waiter that they were \"out\" of the banana fritters showing on both the in-house and online menus'. Four months later, same response.

When I pressed , and asked what it would take to actually get this item in the future, after now being disappointed twice on the same issue, his revised response was, \"Oh, we don't make those anymore.\" With my asking why they remained on the menu, he turned \"sheepish\" and said he \"really should take them off.\"  No s***, Sherlock.

To date, he hasn't troubled himself with that, at least not online. Apparently, knowingly disappointing some percentage of customers and not caring enough to right a wrong is just fine here. Bye, then."}
{"text":"First, I have to say it's nice to have a restaurant cater to people who choose to eat meat-free. A tip 'o the hat for that...

Upon entering the restaurant, it just had a weird energy. It sort of felt like things were just thrown together. Anybody else notice the bad chi? I still decided to order food, but takeout instead of dining in because of the vibe. I went with the kung pao chicken. I can absolutely imagine some vegans/vegetarians not being able to stomach the texture of the faux meat here. I can only imagine all of the processing they do to turn the soy into what they serve. I don't know what kind of pact they made with the meat gods, but they have the texture and look down to a science. Literally. It made me wonder what kind of graduated cylinders, Bunsen burners and potions they have in the back, with some evil scientist, er, I mean chef at the helm. The array of vegetables in my entree looked and tasted fresh and the sauce was good and added with a light hand, which I appreciate. The portions were great, but NOT for the price. My meal was $13! No drink, no salad, no dessert. Er... Do you know how many burrito bowls that is?! Just saying...

All in all, I would go back, but I would steer away from the faux meat and focus on the salads (and the prices!)."}
{"text":"I have been looking for something veggie centric and found Fresh Mint. Very friendly staff, I ordered the Mongolian tofu beef lunch special. Decent amount of food, everything tasted good. A very solid experience.  A little more of the main dish would have been nice."}
{"text":"I was compelled to try Fresh Mint based on its healthy and appetizing menu.  I am happy to report that I wasn't disappointed.  While the pictures on the internet led me to believe the restaurant was more upscale, it was a clean and cozy space located in one of Scottsdale's many strip malls.

I started off dinner with an appetizer of cucumber rolls - light and tasty.  For my entree, I tried the curry apple tofu with brown rice.  It was flavorful and filling.  The portion size was just right.   Against my better judgment (as I mentioned, the entree was filling), I went in for dessert.  The coconut mango tapioca could have been skipped.  The flavor was okay but the consistency was runny for my tastes.

Overall, I found Fresh Mint delightful.  The owner was extremely attentive and personable.  I will definitely return when I'm in town."}
{"text":"for a vegan place, it's decent.  their menu is a combination of thai and vietnanese inspired cuisine.  my only complaint is that their portions relatively small and it's a little pricier."}
{"text":"I was actually pretty disappointed with this one. I love the idea of healthy eating and vegan food but this one was just okay. Loving hut and green are much better. I was pretty surprised at the wonderful reviews on yelp. But I guess if you are vegan it is hard to find anywhere to eat. So myself being a meateater, I give it only 3 stars. And that was generious. But if you love vegan food like I do, try green or loving hut!"}
{"text":"4 stars for : healthy, vegan, TONS of options, something for the noodle person and something for the salad person, lunch special options and a gluten-free menu. Mostly for the fact that it's vegan and doesn't do all crappy vegan processed food... 

I've been here twice and both times ordered carry out - first time was so long ago that I can't recall what I had besides a thai iced tea. 

 Today I opted for their Fresh Mint Salad ($8), and I wanted it to be more traditional Vietnamese so I ordered vermicelli noodles on the side ($3-4). I was hoping the salad would be a bit more 'shredded' rather than diced, but it was good. The flavors are somewhat bland -- they don't use too many spices, herbs, (NO MSG) etc but I was really needing a good, clean, light taste. I also got their thai iced tea (made with coconut milk) - $4. Their thai iced teas are PHENOMENAL, but they are pricey comparatively (which is FINE BY ME! as long as I know it's vegan and not made with crappy condensed milk).

All in all - the food is healthy and light - but don't expect robust/rich/salty/greasy/oily tastes as you would expect in your local Chinese/Asian veggie stir fry. (Hey guys, that means it's better for you). Their noodle/stir fry may be different altogether, but that's not the vibe I got. It's a bit pricier than the average lunch if you order off the regular menu -- otherwise they have $8 lunch specials (but it's vegan and healthy-- to me that's worth it). 

I'd like to come back and try one of the lunch specials or entrees. I liked it. I didn't LOVE it, but I'd come back. Psst, they also have a gluten free menu! YAY. 

Cons: I wish they'd stop using styrofoam containers and plastic bags."}
{"text":"The food is great and always quick! I've never 'eaten in' so I can't speak to that, but quickly becoming one of my favorite to-go lunch places. If you're a plant based eater, or gluten free, and enjoy Vietnamese fare, then this is the place. 

Side note- sometimes this plaza sucks to park in, the lanes legitimately go certain ways so make sure you pay attention to that when you're parking! I've been hit by 2 cars in that lot in the past 6 months ."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my friend last weekend, who is pescetarian, and as I am leaning more toward vegan and vegetarian fare these days, she suggested this place for lunch last Saturday (September 12), and I obliged.

The place was fairly empty when we arrived, nice and cool inside, and the owner, who was also our server (and apparently knows my friend as a regular, as they joked around a bit), seems like a very nice guy.  I really like Thai iced coffee or iced tea, having had Thai iced coffee before at a restaurant in Maryland, so I greedily ordered a glass!  I was pleased that the drink came in a very tall glass, which sufficed my craving for it and quenched my thirst immediately.

I decided to order what my friend did (without extra peanuts! LOL), which was the Lemongrass Soy Beef Delight as my main, and she and I shared an appetizer of summer rolls.  The summer rolls, themselves, were lacking in taste, but that's what the peanut sauce is for, and the sauce made a very nice accompaniment to the rolls.

I was worried about the spice level of the Lemongrass Soy Beef Delight, but it actually was very mild, and I enjoyed it.

My friend and I decided to indulge ourselves and share a piece of carrot cake, and we loved it!  OMFG--heaven on a plate!!  Check out the picture, and you'll see why.

When I'm back in town, I will definitely go here again!  :D"}
{"text":"We stopped in for some tasty vegan fare the other day, and man oh man was it delicious!  We both ordered the fresh lemonade, which I gulped down in 2 seconds...yeah, it was that good! We started with the Lotus Salad (lotus root,carrots, cabbage, etc. lots of crunch) which was to die for! The flavors were spot on and the colors in the dish were nice and vibrant. I ordered a spicy lemongrass soup with noodles and tofu and the little woman ordered a mock-beef lemongrass noodle entree, both of which were superb.  The only reason I'm giving this place four stars instead of five is because the dessert was kind of a bust.  We ordered one slice of carrot cake and a slice of chocolate cake.  They ended up being out of the carrot cake, totally not a big deal (even though my heart was a little broken over it) so we ordered 2 slices of the chocolate cake.  They were rather huge and looked tasty, but the cake itself was suuuuper dry, almost like I was chewing on...well something not soft.  I worked in a vegan restaurant back in the day and have totally had soft and moist vegan cakes.  The cake had many layers that were filled with frosting and fruit fillings. I felt like it kind of lacked flavor and I think they can do better.  I wouldn't get the cake again, but the rest of the meal was fantastic and the service was good, too."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a coworker. The food is good and relatively inexpensive. I had the eggplant with basil and was happy.

Decor is pleasant but I am unsure why they use up 30% of their space for a deli style counter when its all wait served.

Another gripe is with price and vegetarian spots in general. Usually meat is the most expensive item in a dish. If there is no meat then the restaurants costs are lower (not to mention storage and handling savings) so this should be passed on to the consumer. If they offered a $5 lunch menu they would clean up. 

Overall I recommend this since it is healthy and quick."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! 

I eat meat, but not everyday.  This place is beyond satisfaction.  It is a place that one will crave after only one visit! 

Not only is it super yummy, but you leave feeling good about your choices and feeling good about spending money at a place ran by its owners! Wife, husband and son. 

Fresh Mint...you make me feel fresh!!! Thank you:) Looking forward to my next meal w you!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Fresh Mint! You MUST try it! The food is sooooo good, prices are low, and service is helpful. The food is fresh and reliable. The owners are from Maui and the aloha spirit is abundant throughout the restaurant. It is quaint, but the orchids on the tables are beautiful and the Hawaiian pictures are lovely. I love that we have a wonderful, vegetarian option that never disappoints. The veggie fried rice is fantastic!  Dinner entrees are around $10-14, so very affordable. 

To the Yelper who spent $60 on lunch for two: wth did you order?  They have an $8 lunch special... 

To those complaining about how expensive their dinners were, go somewhere with a dollar menu. $14 is reasonable for a fresh dinner entree in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I ordered the yellow curry and it was pretty good! Everything was well cooked.

My father had soy beef and he thought it was real beef (which is a good thing haha)

They were understaffed especially for lunch time. Everything took a while but the staff was friendly.

Portions are on the smaller side which is neither a pro or a con for me.

Overall, good food but they could work on the service a bit.

I would recommend during lunch."}
{"text":"Ok, you know you love a place when you've been there twice in one week.  The first time I went I got the Fresh Island Green Salad and Fried Imperial Rolls.  The second time: the Curry Apple Tofu and the Fried Imperial Rolls.  (As you can tell I adore the rolls!)  What I love about this place is that they give a generous amount of food AND it's good!  A lot of veggie places go a little too far with the \"portion control\" lol!  The presentation is thoughtful and creative.  The man who takes your order is friendly and playful too.  This place definitely is an instant fave :)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I am very disappointed in Fresh Mint. Maybe my expectations are too high because I come from a family of vegetarians who cook Vietnamese food using soy products such as soy chicken, soy beef, and soy fish. First of all, the portion is measly for the high price. I got the golden soy chicken delight, which basically is thinly sliced pieces of gluten with a heavy brown sauce. It was very salty which made me eat more rice with it. Did not justify paying $11. My partner got the curry apple tofu $14, which too was a disappointment. There was no fusion of flavor and the dish lacked depth. 
The reason for the one star is because we felt the service was not good. We arrived when no one else was at the restaurant and it still took 30 minutes for our food to come out. Not once did the server come to ask how we were doing. The server also dressed as if he just jumped out of bed, not professional at all. Overall, for the price I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"Excellent food,vegetables cooked perfectly! Kung pow soy chicken very tasty...good service will visit again."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but the food here is SO good. My complaint is the service although always friendly, definitely slow and very not attentive. It gets pretty annoying actually."}
{"text":"We literally live around the corner and I want to LOVE this place, but I have to just like it.  You definitely get a mix of great cooked food or ok bland, and I'm not sure if it's what you order, or who's cooking, or maybe when you go, but they are a bit inconsistent.  When it's on, it's great.  The service IS a little funny, and since it's such a small place, you have to deal with a personality.  Just roll with it... service is always good when someone means well!  
I still go regularly, but always with a \"we'll see what we get\" feeling.  It's never bad, so I disagree with the 1star review.  And there are SO few choices in Scottsdale, so take what you get or cook at home.  I would absolutely recommend that you try it for yourself, get a few different things and you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"For a delicious casual vegetarian meal, this is a great place.  The eggplant is so good that I have a major challenge ordering anything else.  My wife has tried a few things and they are as good as the eggplant!  Happy to have found this spot."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian restaurant for me. Love it, when i eat here my meat craving leaves. Great friendly staff. I recommend anyone to try it. You'll be surprise of how delicious it is."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews but I always check Yelp for reccomendations on good eats.  I HAD to leave a review for this place because the food is OUTSTANDING!  The owner and his wife and daughter were all working and were all extremely friendly (they're form Hawaii) and the food was very flavorful and perfectly cooked and presented.  I have been veggie for 7 years now and haven't found a place I love this much since I lived in NYC.  Oh and they're mango pudding for dessert was to die for.  5 stars awesome place!  I would go every day if it was more convenient to me."}
{"text":"Took an out of town relative here, who is vegetarian. ordered several dishes, with the \"chicken\" and overall the food was really good. The \"chicken\" had a good flavor and the texture wasnt bad either, comes pretty close to the real thing.  The peanut sauce that comes with the vegetable plate tasted good, but was cold, which we felt was odd to serve with warm vegetables. The servers were nice, but one at least 2 occasions, we needed something for our table and there were no servers to be found.  We were sitting outside, maybe that was the issue.  I had to walk inside the restaurant to call for a server to assist us.  The portions were a little small, especially for the high-ish prices.  We appreciate that it is kosher though, and will try to come again."}
{"text":"I went with my mom I ordered the tomato stuffed with tofu, veggies and herbs. The meal was mostly delicious but I am dinging a star because I asked him (the owner was our server) if they could possibly not put sauce on it, and he insisted that the sauce was integrated into the meal and it would be impossible NOT to sauce it. Then the meal arrived and the sauce had been poured on top in copious amounts....but it was not integrated into the meal at all so there was no reason for him to have denied my request. The sauce was sweet, and gross (I hate sweet sauces!) and I'm irked that he ruined an otherwise excellent vegan meal. But he was friendly and nice and he tried to help us select our meals (it was our first time there) and I would definitely return and try some less saucy things."}
{"text":"I love it here!! Always  amazing food!! Always amazing service!! The owners are fantastic people. We have tried several dishes here. All have been spectacular. We love to share each dish with each other. It's great bc it is healthy and kosher! The kids always eat all their veggies, and love the peanut sauce (and for good reason it is perfection)
I cant say enough good things about Fresh Mint!!
Can't wait for our next visit!!"}
{"text":"The Summer Roll appetizer and the Mushroom Entree was delicious.  This is my first of many trips here. All Aces!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for another good find for vegetarian eats! We were running errands in Scottsdale and wanted to grab a light dinner before heading back north. Quick search on Yelp and this place popped up so we mosied on over. Small and simple diner-style restaurant in a strip mall. We didn't want a huge meal so hubby and I shared the Fresh Cucumber Rolls to start and followed that with their Curry Apple Tofu. Both generous portions and the cucumber rolls were perfectly refreshing on a sweltering day. I wasn't as keen on their peanut sauce as my hubby but it did the trick. The Curry Apple Tofu was flavorful with a nice bit of spice for heat. We devoured it! Service was friendly and lighthearted. Great prices too. We'd happily stop here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Incredible varieties. 

Only bad thing is the old guy behind the kitchen. When it gets busy, he freaks out and puts bad vibes in the air. 

Don't be sad dude!! Business is good."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I haven't ordered anything here that isn't absolutely scrumptious. They have great lunch deals and everything is always fresh and perfectly cooked and seasoned. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had the autumn spring rolls & the five spice pho. I LOVED it! I was so full I felt like my stomach would burst and I still wanted more it was so good. I've had \"vegetarian\" pho at another restaurant that the broth was bland and it was so overloaded with veggies it was distracting. They kept it simple with a sweet yet savory broth, veg meat (which was actually really good to my surprise), and even a vegan fish sauce. The owner (husband) was SO nice and even told me how to assemble my soup (which I already knew since I've had traditional pho many many times). The best thing is that everything on the menu is vegan (except for #31, which has egg noodles). I'm excited to go back and try some of the chef specials, they sound fantastic!"}
{"text":"I ended up having \" soy\" chicken , not a place for meat lovers , less quantity .."}
{"text":"Amazing! Hands down my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Consistently delicious! Everything on the menu is great, but I usually get the #12 Large - Five Spice Noodle Soup (Pho). While the food is incredible, the owners are the main reason that I continue going back for more! I love this place! I get so excited talking about it...  I can't wait until my next visit! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Most amazing food in all of Scottsdale. I'm vegan and never had as many amazing delicious options. The service is amazing, owners are so friendly, restaurant is clean pretty and cozy. I seriously travel to Scottsdale from Canada just so I can eat at this restaurant. Veggie eaters and non veggie eaters should all check this place out."}
{"text":"Three words. Kung Pao Chicken. SO good. I especially love that they also have gluten free options. Fresh, healthy ingredients that taste fab. I'm all about that."}
{"text":"Good food excellent selection service was great no complaints will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to go here twice recently and loved it both times.  The food is fresh and healthy.  The service is a little slow but that is due to everything being cooked fresh upon order, which is defiantly worth the wait."}
{"text":"Oh my healthiness! 

What a lovely restaurant in Arizona. There are so many vegan options! The entire restaurant is 100 percent vegetarian, and I believe vegan. Yes you read that right, 100 percent. 

Locally owned by a couple and inspired by Vietnamese cuisine. Located in a big strip mall but the restaurant itself isn't that big. 


There were so many delicious sounding dishes on the menu that we ordered a few plates to share. 

We ordered the fresh cucumber rolls,Five spice noodle soup, rainbow wonder. All of which were extremely tasty and beautiful and color. I really enjoy the dipping sauce for the fresh cucumber rolls. I would describe this plate as a \"raw\" vegetable sushi roll. 


The five spice noodle soup could've had a little bit more flavor although it was still good. I really enjoyed how there was sauce and some other vegetables on the side to put into the soup if you would like.

I almost forgot about the fried vegetable imperial rolls which were super scrumptious. They were fried to perfection and had a perfect crunch accompanied by a sweet savory dipping sauce. 


My favorite of all it was the rainbow wonder it was a beautiful dish composed of a wide variety of vegetables on top of brown rice. The food came out in a prompt manner and the service was OK. 


I took my non-vegan family with me to this restaurant and they all enjoyed the food even though at times they are Skeptical of vegan food lacking flavor. However they were impressed and enjoy all of the food that they tried. 

I want to make the prices seem a little bit high for what the food was, however if I was in the area again I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Took my mom here while she was visiting town since she is a vegetarian and she loved it! We had the Mongolian beef and pan fried noodles, both of which were tastey. This place makes me want to ditch the meat and convert to veggies."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted some Vegan food - she loves Vegan food. Any way - the ambiance is fresh and the service stellar! I had the Chow mein and my wife had the Kung Pao soy chicken. Both dishes were delicious and the portion size was adequate. The prices were fair. We will be back!

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"There really needs to be more vegetarian restaurants in AZ! I feel like there is enough demand, so what gives? Chakra is still my favorite but they have such limited hours that I never get the chance to eat there. Fresh mint is amazing and their hours are much better but it's still very far from where I live, but luckily close to where I live. 

I agree with the consensus that their Kung Pao Soy Chicken is really good. In the future I'd really like to branch out and try some of their soups but I tend to stick with what works. The owner is usually there and helping the staff and he is really friendly and affable. Overall, fresh mint has an extensive menu, pretty reasonable prices and a nice interior. I hope they open more in the Central Phoenix area in the future!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food! Vegetarian fare, but definitely not just for vegetarians. I sat next to the kitchen and saw beautiful plate after plate being made. The owners grow many of their own organic vegetables that are used in the restaurant.
I'll be coming back again, and again!"}
{"text":"Nice family run business. All very friendly. Love that vegetarians can eat anything on the menu. King Pao Chicken hit the spot."}
{"text":"I did go nuts for this spot. I loved the fresh vegetables and the owner is spot on when it comes to customer service. He was friendly, fast and extremely accommodating. I came here on my lunch alone and they had plenty of local reding material for me to choose from! Local = community supporters 

Enjoying my veggie, tofu and Stir Fried Noodles. The noodles were delish, topped with assorted vegetables and tofu. The sauce was their special fresh mint brown sauce and they let me order it with extra species!"}
{"text":"Just delicious! Living in Keirland there isn't much to choose from that's on the vegetarian side. Fresh is a fun place with Asian/Vegan twist. 

The food is fresh the whole menu caters to a healthy diet. I went withe the Eggplant and wasn't disappointed. I will be stopping back soon."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite vegan friendly place in all of Phoenix right now. Very very clean, nice looking restaurant. The owners were so sweet and catering. I ordered Pho for the first time and was just blown away. Everything else I ordered was also amazing like the fried bananas and Thai tea. Prices are pretty good as well. I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Just found this place last weekend. Already took mom back there for lunch today. The food...is...amazing!!! The prices are very good with good sized portions. We split a roll and a curry dish and both left feeling full. The atmosphere is ok, a little too eclectic for my taste but the food quality more than makes up for it. Both times I went (off peak lunch hours) it wasn't very busy, so it was a very laid back vibe."}
{"text":"I've been to Fresh Mint several times over the past years and always have a great meal. Having changed jobs, I find myself in that part of town less, but revisited last week with a vegetarian friend and a girlfriend who dabbles. I, on the other hand, enjoy being an omnivore, but regardless of culinary position, this place is just plain great. I'm amazed at how flavorful the sauces are and the menu is fairly diverse with great choices. It's run by a husband/wife team who do the serving and cooking, so you're basically eating their home-cooked meals. I've heard it is also a Kosher certified restaurant, so you know you're getting quality food."}
{"text":"Food was great. Light and fresh. Pad Thai was good but the vegetable fried rice was perfect. The guy working today was super friendly and attentive to all who came in. Glad I found this place. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The sweet and sour soup is unbelievably great! I would go back to Scottsdale just to eat at this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"We are always on the hunt for vegan fare so dropped in to Fresh Mint for lunch.  We expected to find the usual sandwiches and soups.  Instead we had a whole menu of asian cuisine, beautifully prepared and presented while seated at a table with a real tablecloth.  Who knew?  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The good: the food was excellent. We will return but not during the day due to the heat.  The bad: the temperature in the restaurant was over 80 degrees.  The two owners were sitting down having lunch so we seated ourself. It took awhile for the owner to deliver menus in an unfriendly manner. Obviously, we interrupted his lunch. We felt as though we were not welcome. Lunch was excellent though a bit expensive. He finally warned up with a smile after delivering the check.  We would try it again but we would not go out of our way."}
{"text":"Nice find in the Phoenix suburbs.  Kind of an Asian version of Green.  Lots of vegetarian dishes to choose from.  I got the veggie fried rice while my date got the lotus salad.  Maybe a little pricey for what it is, but the service from the staff was excellent and it was a nice cozy comfortable setup.  I don't frequent vegetarian restaurants often, but the veggie fried rice with tofu was pretty tasty and the portion was quite hearty.  Even if you're a carnivore like me its worth a try.  Vegans and vegetarians alike will love this place."}
{"text":"Kosher and vegetarian. A definite plus. The dishes are delicious and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The servings though, in comparison to their price, are quite small and disappointing. For example, I ordered an appetizer for $6 and it was served as 6 pieces of raw vegetables with a small cup of peanut sauce. Main dish servings are approximately a heaping cup of food. For a small break, try the lunch menu for an array of their popular dishes for $8 each. Servings are still small."}
{"text":"I really don't like vegan places that try to make vegetable look like real meat, but I have to admit, Fresh Mint does the best job of all the places I've visited.  I had the orange chicken, which was pretty amazing.  I scarfed the whole plate down without even thinking about it.  Service was kind of strange, probably because this is family run, so the husband, wife, and daughter team is serving you."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here recently...and it was delicious! I phoned in my order during a busy dinner time, so it was a bit chaotic and the food took a longer than they had quoted me, but it was worth the wait. I had the imperial rolls, which are like veggie-filled non-greasy egg rolls, and the pad thai. I wasn't sure about a vegetarian pad thai without chicken/shrimp, but neither was missed because the flavor was amazing. Definitely will be ordering food from here again--just maybe during a less busy time."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service was really terrible. Long wait time. No one checks on you at all. We wanted to add to our order and the waiter actually signed as if to say \" really you want something else?\"
I went with my toddler and noticed three other babies there and yet no change table. That's the main reason I would never go back add that to the the ridiculous waiter and this place is off my list."}
{"text":"We like to get take out from here on occasion. The service is friendly enough and the food is Yummers but my gripe is the pricing :p 

$14 for a veggie hot pot?? The food is good, can't complain but it's just hard to see where they justify this kind of pricing. 

We will come back again I'm sure....my wallet just needs some recovery time though..."}
{"text":"Went for the 1st time it was pretty busy for lunch on a Monday (considering its fairly new) owners were active in and out of the kitchen, which is always nice to see. Had some good lunch options for a reasonable $8 (comes with small salad and side of rice) I disliked the nickel and dimeing. I added egg rolls and an iced tea and ended up with a just shy of $18 bill... for lunch!! The food was good though. And it's one of the ONLY vegan options within a 5 mile radius of my house that's not a fancy sit down joint. So I'll definitely return. Happy Eating!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Some of the portions were a teeny bit less than expected, but the price was fair and the food was great. Very nice man served us and kept the refills comin'.

Every potential new favorite vegan place is worth a shot as far as I'm concerned, and Fresh Mint did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Very nice and reasonable place! Food is made fresh and they can accomodate my no onion/no garlic diet, which is rare. Good size portions and quick service"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and we were pleasantly surprised. We got spring roll appetizers which were solid and then the kung pao \"chicken\". It was really fresh tasting and delicious. Veggies were perfectly cooked. We also has the fried rice which was hearty and tasty, a meal in its self. I would give it 5 stars if they had wine and a better environment, but come for the food and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh vegan options! The Kung Pao chicken and ginger beef was delicious! The restaurant is owned by the friendliest vegan couple. The Thai Tea is so satisfying and refreshing. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"The service can be slow but it is worth it for a vegetarian/vegan...or anyone really! The owners are friendly and nice. The food is delicious and fresh. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a healthy, delicious veggie meal."}
{"text":"I ALWAYS enjoy Fresh Mint. It is by far one of my favorite restaurants. As a vegan/vegetarian, it is hard to find healthy, flavorful food. Fresh Mint, never disappoints!

P.s. Try the yummy lemonade!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. A bit pricey for the portion sizes, which isn't unusual for this neighborhood, but it is for a little casual placer like this. However, it's the only vegan restaurant on this side of town so it's worth it if you're craving a fresh, non-meaty treat."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  Locally owned, great service and a great vegetarian menu with vegan options.  We had the soy fish hot pot and and Pad Thai with veg-chicken, and spring rolls for an appetizer. All so delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Absolutely everything I've tasted here was delicious, from the iced jasmine tea to the main entrees. I'm glad to have another vegetarian/vegan restaurant option of this caliber in town.

We started off the meal with the Fresh Summer Rolls, followed by the Lotus Salad, an order of Stir Fried Noodles and the Kung Pao Soy Chicken. The rolls were large and quite filling on their own. Next, we split an order of Lotus Salad; with fresh squeezed lime on top it was divine. Crisp, crunchy and cool... perfect for a summer lunch. The Stir Fried Noodles were very good too, but the real standout was the Kung Pao Soy Chicken... I couldn't stop eating it! We finished everything and I was very satisfied. The interior is immaculate and service is very friendly. I will definitely be adding this restaurant to my rotation of favorites..."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch while killing time between appointments in the area. Its a cute, clean space and the man running the place greeted me warmly and inquired if it was my first visit. I said yes and told him I had seen the place before when in the area and had always wanted to give it a try. It was lunchtime on a Friday and it was busy, but service was top notch.
 They had lunch specials that someone at a table near me commented \"must be new\". I couldn't decide between the kung pao soy chicken and the eggplant dish, but the gentleman taking my order said the Kung pao was a restaurant fave, so I went with that. I'm not a vegetarian, but I sho eat faux meat!- and this was good. It came with a side salad and brown or white rice on the side, and for 8 bucks was a perfectly sized meal. The spice queen in me would have added srircha had it been around, but I didn't ask for it because it really wasn't necessary. There was plenty of sauce that had a little kick to it and being in a \"healthy place\" helped me reason that the added sodium was unnecessary. (Don't know about you, but i like to pretend I'm a health guru when surrounded by the like. Its my own fun game!) 
Bottom line- I really liked this place and asked for a to go menu to take to work bc I will return again for the eggplant!"}
{"text":"Nice family business-the order works to place amazingly well and very attentive! Fresh food, meat and vegan options. I'm definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This is it! Fresh, healthy and delicious. It's where those Scottsdale skinny girls who never eat  when they're with you, run off to and eat their fill without worrying."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Fresh Mint for years and it is consistently so good! I've tried almost every dish and they never disappoint.  The curry dishes and the Mongolian Soy Beef are two favorites. For dinner try the Citrus Spare Ribs....heaven on a plate. The lunch specials are a great deal and everything is loaded with flavor.  For the reviewer who stated you get .60 worth of food, I'm not sure where you eat or how much you expect on a lunch plate.  I leave full and happy.  This is a staple for me and I miss their food when it's been a while. Love Fresh Mint!"}
{"text":"Yummy! $8 for a healthy and delicious lunch.  Good portion size, not huge, not too small.  Had the Eggplant with Basil.  Looking forward to trying the veggie kabobs next time."}
{"text":"Eggplant wins! Eggplant wins!
Eating here is awesome. The man that owns this is so nice. He always gives the girls at the table a little stuffed animal. He says for the kid in  you. Im SERIOUS!

The food is fresh, crisp, flavorful.
Makes you want to eat healthy all the time!
Great for a quick lunch, it takes just the right amount of time to come out. Not too soon where you wonder if it has sat under a heat lamp all day. 

The water is good, not like some places here where you can taste the pipes. 


LOVE THIS PLACE.
WISH THEY WOULD OPEN ONE IN GOOD OLD COUNTRY TOWN MESA/APACHE JUNCTION...HINT HINT!

Keep up the good work.
I wish they would replace all Mcdonalds with you!"}
{"text":"My strict vegetarian wife wanted us to find a vegetarian place that had some interesting items. We found this place using the Happy Cow website. Fresh Mint has a delightful array of flavorful 100% vegan entrees. We had a stuffed tomato entree and a vegan sushi - or close to sushi - more like a wrap. The place is a bit out of the way - on Upper N Scottsdale Drive - and faces away from the street. Inexpensive, delicious and quite the find."}
{"text":"As much as I'd love to become a vegetarian, it's always sounded like way too much work, mostly because of all the washing and chopping of vegetables.  If I could just get all my meals from Fresh Mint, I'd be good to go.  The Pad Thai with tofu and vegetables is delicious.  They have a lot of fake meat options but I prefer to just go with tofu or just vegetables.  Fresh Mint really shows how varied and flavorful vegetarian food can be."}
{"text":"Eek! Methinks not, indeed!

Okay, I never usually give a place a 1 star because I have this moral dilemma with it... BUT, I also never usually walk out of a restaurant. 

So, I walked in, was awkwardly greeted, and told to have a seat. It was lunch time, so the place was full, but not overflowing with stressed out customers. In all honesty, it was a typical lunchtime scenario inside. 

*I'd also like to note that I read reviews for slower than average service, so I was prepared to wait a little extra to try the food*

Once I sat down, I noticed the server bringing menus over to the patrons that entered immediately before me, but he never came over with one for me. I decided to patiently wait for the next five minutes. That's when I started overhearing the conversation at the table next to me, and to sum it up:

I don't know if we can stay and eat, we might have to get it to go.. We've been waiting a long time.

Again, that's not verbatim, but it's exactly along those lines. I figured the reviews were right about the food prep times, and continued to wait. 

After a few more minutes passed by, another couple walked in, were acknowledged and seated, and after a minute, they were given menus (This is about 8-10 minutes in). It was then that the server came over with water for the first couple that had walked in before me. He then walked back to the drink area and brought out two more glasses of water for the couple that came in almost ten minutes after me. With no menu, water or sense of appreciation for wanting to spend my money at Fresh Mint, I got up and walked out.

A good way to lose a customer is to not serve them. With service complaints since 2008 on Yelp, I really think something needs to be done. That was unbelievably insulting."}
{"text":"I stumbled onto Fresh Mint as I was heading to the Subway sandwich shop for a salad (I swear!). What I great find for a healthy fulfilling lunch.
I ordered the curry and brown rice and it was perfectly cooked and portioned for a lunch special. I would have preferred it to be a bit spicier and will request that on my next visit. 

Service was very good as I was checked on a number of times and was able to get in and out during a lunch break. Yupper Fresh Mint goes right in to the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"My first time here! I was able to seat myself. The pho with tofu beef and spring rolls were ordered along with a cup of coffee. I wish they had vegan friendly \"cream\" for the coffee they serve because it does exist but overall decent experience. The customer service was also good here. I'm not sure if I'll be back but for a change AND if I'm in the area, I may consider."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place but I just wasn't a fan.  First of all the bathroom had no soap for me to wash my hands.  The owner seemed really frazzled that he had just stocked the soap in there and maybe someone stole it.  He was helpful in getting some but it was still annoying.

Then the dish I ordered was not good at all.... Hot Pot.  I'm sure it was an issue of personal tastes vs. quality but the whole vegetarian fake fish grossed me out.

The prices are a bit high and I just won't be going back.

Oh, I also tried the lemonade (expensive and I couldn't see or taste any mint in it.)"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time with friends from out of town who are vegan! What an amazing surprise! Super picky girl right here and I loved all the options they had!! Everything was super flavorful and tasty! I couldn't get enough of the veggie kabobs and the spring rolls were fabulous! My boyfriend loved the pho and Kung pow chicken and I really enjoyed the mushrooms!! Our service made the dinner that much more enjoyable Emily and Danielle were so kind and sweet! They made sure we all had everything we needed and made us feel welcome the whole time! This is definitely a new favorite and will be back often! Also love that they have a mezuzah on the door-got to explain to my friends what that was, not common to see on restaurant out here made me feel amazing walking in :) personal addition but always a plus!!! Thank you Emily we will see you soon!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! Great place to impress your meat eating friends! The best dish is the Kung poa Soy Chicken and the appetizer kabobs are also amazing! A little pricy for what you get but the food is really that tasty and its even healthy too!"}
{"text":"I love her cooking!!! Everything I eat there is absolutely delicious, fresh and very healthy.  I always leave feeling good, like the food nourished me and not poisoned me. One of my favorites!!!

I always get the lemon grass soup, peppered steak and thai tea:)"}
{"text":"hmmmm.  so yummy in my tummy vegetarian Asian food, not bad, not bad at all and a must try!  I had a Vietnamese Pho and it was made with veggie broth which made me nervous because does veggie broth really taste good?  Surprisingly it did and I had a take out and the packaging was nicely presented, with the noodles and veggies and side sauces in one container, in different compartments and the soup in a separate container, thus preventing the noodles from overcooking and getting too mushy.  I have had other dishes here in the past and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Let me start out by stating that I am not vegetarian or vegan. I will eat (or at least try) anything. That being said, this food was amazing.

I had their Spicy Lemongrass Tofu (extra spicy!) with brown rice, and I could not find a single thing wrong with the dish. Being a lunch special ($8 for a perfect portion -- amazing, right?) it came with the rice (no upcharge for brown!) and a salad. The dressing on the salad was just right; not too bold, not too bland, just delicious. Then the main meal... wow. First off, I was impressed by the spice, which doesn't happen often. I'll eat some crazy spicy things, so when I ask for \"extra spicy,\" I want them to bring the heat... and bring it they did! Now I'm not saying this was nuclear hot. It was, again, just right. A couple beads of sweat formed on my forehead, but it didn't interrupt the flavor at all or leave my mouth feeling like Death Valley. Moving on from that, the flavor was incredible, the portion was just the right amount to fill me up; I could not find a single flaw with the food.

The only warning I will give is, beware the lunch rush! This place is small and has great food, which means it *will* fill up! This can make service a little bit slow at times when they get overwhelmed, but it is well worth the wait if you've got the time."}
{"text":"Ate here last night.  Food was good.  Service not so good.  We were 7 people including 2 small children.  I made a reservation for 730. When we arrived the table was not ready. We were left squashed in to a table for 4 for about 25 minutes before we were seated.  No offer of a glass of water or temporary seating for all of us.   After we finished out meal we were rushed out and not even offered a dessert menu.  This was already 9 pm and the restaurant wanted to close.  Wish they were more friendly."}
{"text":"I found out about this place in my Phoenix hotel room as I was channel surfing and landed on a show called \"Check, Please! Arizona\" where three really polite women were describing their favorite local restaurant to the semi-interested host. The funny thing is that I was on an episode of \"Check, Please! Bay Area\" several years ago where I was one of three heavily opinionated people defending our restaurant choices as the host was pounding Chardonnay. What drew me here was that it was a well-regarded vegetarian place with an Asian accent much like the excellent Veggie Village (review: http://bit.ly/2uJzEZT). Will lightning strike twice?

Phoenix always surprises me with its geographic size as it took me almost an hour to get here from Peoria where I was staying. The restaurant turned out to be in the middle of a shopping center parking lot which I have noticed is a common piece of real estate for a lot of eateries here. I must have been early because I was their first customer of the evening, and it looked like the manager was still working on the books at one of the tables. As I indulgently sidled into a booth that could easily fit four, it didn't take me long for me to figure out what to order because it all sounded organic and healthy to me. I first tried the $5.95 Fresh Cucumber Rolls which I first saw on the show.

They rolled up fried tofu, marinated julienne white radish, carrot, and fresh mint, and vermicelli noodles, all rolled up in a thin slice of cucumber and served with a thick and delectable peanut sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2jcfEbp). I frankly couldn't get enough of those. The same price Autumn and Summer Rolls appeared just as appetizing. For my entree, I ordered the $11.95 Rainbow Wonder, an abundant platter of stir-fried vegetables in seven different colors (thus the apt name) along with shiitake mushrooms, all of it mixed with a sesame-ginger garlic sauce and accompanied by brown rice (photo http://bit.ly/2AYQh42). Just perfect for a late summer meal.

FOOD - 5 stars...simple executions of really healthy dishes, well turned with an Asian twist
AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...unsurprisingly green and more fast food-looking than expected but still quite peaceful
SERVICE - 4 stars...attentive even if I was the only one in there
TOTAL - 5 stars...Chef May Li has figured out an epicurean niche for her bountiful dishes and it works"}
{"text":"The most prominent flavor in the food here is the produce, which is fine when you're using high quality produce, but I ordered Pad Thai and expected to taste at least SOME peanut sauce. The Udon noodles were extremely overcooked, soggy, and watery. The best thing I had was the Thai iced tea, but even that wasn't worth the $3.95 price tag. Lunch was about $30 total for two people and two iced teas-- not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME... I am a meat and potatoes kind of girl... a definite carnivore but I just keep having to return time and time again to this place. The Spicy Ginger Soy Beef and the Pad Thai are both excellent and the Mint Lemonade is refreshing. If you want to see how good vegetarian food can be this is THE place to go... If there were more places like this I could see being an occasional vegetarian (I couldn't give up meat completely)."}
{"text":"Cute little place! The owner serves you himself and everything is made fresh to order. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is vegan or vegetarian as the menu accommodates perfectly. Try the iced jasmine tea!"}
{"text":"great place for lunch! about 10 different options on their lunch menu, so a lot to choose from. Recently started a new diet, and I love this place because everything tastes great and doesn't feel like 'diet food'. You can watch them make everything, and all of their ingredients are fresh. Will continue to come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but the time I went, I felt the food was a bit expensive for what we got. It's not bad and the staff is incredibly nice, but it didn't impress me in particular.

Also, when when I ordered the egg roll and asked how many pieces we get, the server told me 8. When the eggroll came, it was just two eggrolls cut into 8 tiny pieces. Haha...what the hell."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, and would recommend it to anyone!  It is Vegan, and everything I've eaten has been excellent at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate at this place last night. We left with upset stomachs and no reason to ever come here again. 

The atmosphere upon arrival seemed cute, slightly hippie/hipsterish. We were excited to dine here as we're both a fan of mom and pop places.

We ordered the Thai Tea to drink which was interesting to say the least. Full of flavor but wayyyy too much sugar and coconut cream! 


30 minutes into service we finally got our cucumber rolls. These don't need to be cooked... I could make them with my eyes closed. Not sure why they took 30 minutes but they were delicious! And the peanut sauce, ONE OF A KIND! 

But then we waited another 30 minutes for our dinner to come out. I ordered pho and my bf ordered the imperial noodle dish. A few bites in and he ran to the restroom to heave.

The pho was OK. Nothing fancy. The fake beef was really gross. 

We had his noodles taken off by the owner which was nice of him but In the end we both left with tummy aches.

One tip if the owners are reading this: You need more than 1 cook back there and maybe a waiter with a little more experience (the gentleman running the floor messed up a few orders around the restaurant and seemed very stressed)"}
{"text":"Great place! Really good food that tastes like authentic meat and friendly staff with great service !"}
{"text":"The name is fresh mint however I did not see many mint items on the menu.

I  was in a hurry and got a to go order off the $8 lunch menu. The menu has many options for traditional veggie favorites to some with fake meat.
 I wanted to give a faux cow a try and I went with the Mongolian beef. It took about 6 min and I was given my 3 compartment Styrofoam box.

Inside the main compartment was the Mongolian beef with fancy cut carrots onions and celery. Brown rice on the side (a nice no charge up grade) and a small salad. Not bad for $8.

The Mongolian beef was decent not evident it was faux cow, the veggies were crisp the sauce was a bit bland however. The rice was cooked well and the salad was fresh and crisp. The portion size was a bit smaller than some one of my size would like.
 
That is the key to \"healthily food\", less food what a great business model."}
{"text":"Listed here as a Thai restaurant, Fresh Mint actually touts themselves as specializing in Vietnamese cuisine.  Nevertheless, I'm always overjoyed to find Asian restaurants serving vegan food.  And in the Valley?  Even more so.

I tried the summer rolls as an appetizer and the golden soy chicken as an entree.  The rolls were top notch and well-presented, to boot.  Overall, the food was above average.  But the entree was pricier than what I'm used to in SF for the same type of meal.  Not to mention, the portions were a bit skimpy.  That's a bit of a problem, especially since they're just a casual, strip mall joint.

The service was initially welcoming and prompt, but it trailed off as I neared the end of the meal and was looking for my glass to be refilled and the check to be brought.

They've definitely filled a niche out here, so I doubt their shortcomings make a huge difference; they seem to be doing a brisk amount of business.  But if you're unlike most Scottsdale residents who have money burning a hole in their pocket, I wouldn't advise making it a regular habit of coming here."}
{"text":"The owners are super friendly. The atmosphere is inviting and casual. They have the best vegan Thai iced tea and pho in town."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! This was my first time trying vegan food and I was amazed at how delicious it was! The Golden Chicken Soy delight and Rainbow Wonder were our favorites. The staff were incredibly helpful and patient with answering my questions and educating me on this new way of eating!! I will definitely return and even took a \"takeout menu\" with me!!!"}
{"text":"I got the lotus shoot salad and my friend had the fresh lemongrass tofu--which is actually fried. Mine was alright. Hers was pretty good. But it was all sort of lackluster and boring. It just seemed like something you could get anywhere."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I have been here several times both during the work week and on the weekend.

This is not a good place to come and dine-in if you have limited time (such as a lunch break). The service is pretty slow. Even slower if there are a lot of people dining during a peak time. I recommend calling for takeout if you are on a tight schedule.

If you have plenty of time and don't mind waiting a little while, I feel that it is worth it. Everything I have tried has been very good. My favorite is the Sesame Soy, which is teriyaki-style tofu with sesame seeds sprinkled on top, with a side of rice and steamed vegetables.

One thing I found a little weird, though it isn't necessarily a bad thing, was that they only give forks to eat with. They have other utensils if you need them, but you have to ask.

I am not a vegetarian anymore, but I still greatly enjoy vegetarian and vegan food. I recommend this place to pretty much everyone if they enjoy good, clean food and don't mind a little wait to get it."}
{"text":"HOT POT!

Last time I went to Fresh Mint, I ordered the Hot Pot, my new favorite. I tried a few other things on the menu since my first visit, all were delicious, but nothing was as good as the Hot Pot.

We started with the Pho, which apparently is pronounced \"phu'uh\", making my first review even funnier. I had no clue.
I progessed on to the Hot Pot (I may have already mentioned its deliciousness) and even got as far as dessert. The cake was magnificent. From what I heard, the mango tapioca was less fantastic. An allergy to mango kept me from trying that one.

I have and will continue to go back to Fresh Mint. This is the best fake meat in Phoenix and one of the best restaurants all around."}
{"text":"Fast and tasty! They create the dishes when you order them and the flavor was not bland or weak! I think it is really nice because this restaurant inspires you to cook similar dishes at home when you run out of things to make. 

They also had purple cauliflower in the rainbow dish which was pretty cool."}
{"text":"I truly wish I could give this place 3.5 stars. I love the concept of this restaurant. I spoke with the chef/owner's husband who was our server and he mentioned that they have a few other Fresh Mint restaurants, one of which is in Hawaii. I ordered the cucumber rolls (appetizer) and my bf ordered the pho. It took an exceptionally long time to get our food after lunch rush hour. While I appreciate that everything is made when you order it... An hour seems like an aweful long time to wait for julienned veggies wrapped in raw cucumber with a side of peanut sauce. The pho followed a few moments later. I liked it but my compadres felt it was less than authentic. Bottom line... Go here if you are in the mood for healthy fair that's vegan friendly and you're not in a rush!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! We drive way out of our way to order take-out. They're definitively understaffed. But the food is so good, I will wait however long it takes. The portions can be kinda small, but prices are good and the quality is excellent."}
{"text":"For a strict vegetarian with limited *good* dining out options, I was excited to try Fresh Mint after several friends told me the food was great. 

Despite reading many negative reviews about the service, I indeed experienced a waiting time for food that was inexcusable. We were the ONLY 2 people in the restaurant and it took almost 2 hours to get drinks,order, and receive food. The food itsself was about what you'd expect for asian vegetarian, but if I ever came back I would order takeout. 

Their \"patio\" is basically in a parking lot facing a strip mall. Not a good ambiance at all, and the decor is tastelessly outdated and drab."}
{"text":"This place is legendary!

Back-story:
So my mom desperately needed a break from taking care of my father who just had a total knee replacement and I decided to take her out to lunch. Now, my mom is a picky eater and generally only goes to the same three restaurants for lunch and dinner, so when I asked her where she wanted to go and she deferred the question back to me, I responded in a sarcastic tone \"Fresh Mint, its a vegan restaurant that is pretty amazing,\" thinking she would ignore the suggestion and say \"let's go to Chili's\". Well, I don't know know if she was high on my Dad's Vicodin or the world is indeed ending in December of 2012, but she actually agreed and off we went to the strip mall on Thunderbird and Scottsdale.

Restaurant-story:
The restaurant itself is small, but because two of the walls are glass windows it doesn't give you a claustrophobic feel and somehow the neon green and bright purple walls (which had a giant metal mint leaf on it) help out as well. There are three booths, which could sit four (skinny people) comfortably, four four-top tables, and four two-top tables, with a few tables outside. 

We were greeted immediately by one of the co-owners (the husband) who let us choose where we would like to sit (there was only one table occupied) and handed us our menus. My mother ordered a plain iced tea and I decided to mix it up and go with their Thai iced tea. This deliciousness consists of Thai tea, a little bit of sugar, and coconut milk. I found it to be super sweet and rich that it should be considered a dessert as opposed to a routine drink with meals.

The portions here are a decent size and the lunch time prices are perfect. We split the Fresh Autumn Rolls($6), Fresh Island Green Salad ($9), and the Steamed Veggies served with a side of peanut sauce. Everything was so fresh tasting and even my mother enjoyed everything! She actually said she would come back to this place for lunch anytime, leaving Fresh Mint legendary in my book!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, fresh and delicious. Phoenix is desperate for more restaurants such as this. My only complaint was with the somewhat confused service on a quiet evening, but I'm betting they were just having an off-night. Well-worth the drive from any part of the Valley."}
{"text":"Went here due to a Check Please episode. It was meh... was not impressed that for a somewhat Vietnamese restaurant (even though they don't really tout it as such), the green tea they serve is bigelow or some other similar grocery brand. I was hoping for something that came in a pot. Also didn't like the Thai iced tea. The food was okay, but after we have discovered Flower Child not so far away, if we want vegetarian food we would rather go to Flower Child instead."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I came here for lunch yesterday and returned today (next day) for dinner. It's not a fancy place but is very clean, linen covered tables and warm customer service. My first experience was the Green Mango salad. Simply one of the best things I have ever eaten. And the portion was HUGE!  For dinner, I ordered Kung Pao as my entree and Cucumber Rolls for an appetizer. First, the Cucumber Rolls were insane!  I could have eaten another order or two!  Kung Pao is their most popular dish and I can see why. Loved all the super fresh vegetables. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with Fresh Mint!   This place is amazing.   And I'm NOT a vegetarian!!    We had a gift certificate so we went all out and tried lots of different options on our first visit.  I'll give you the scoop, but for a quick snapshot -here's the deal: 
-super affordable, meals between $5-10.
-generous portions
-delicious & flavorful foods (Kung Pao!) 
-friendly staff
-casual environment 

First up:  Fresh summer rolls and Green Papaya salad.    The spring rolls were beautiful. Wow!  They had a little more lettuce than I personally prefer, but the taste was still great.  The papaya salad was delicious.  It was not spicy at all, and I will probably ask for a little more spice or peanut sauce on the side next time, but it was so flavorful it still hit the spot.  Two of us shared this dish and I still took home enough for another meal the next day - definitely good for sharing.  

Next course: Pho / Five Spice Noodle Soup. This dish amazed me.  A little sweet, so savory and rich flavored.  Tasted like homemade beef pho.  My family has Pho for Christmas each year - this definitely could be in the running for my favorite Pho! 

Entrees:   Upon recommendations from our server, we chose the Pad Thai & the Kung Pao dishes.   Both were generous portions and bursting with flavor.  They are also just beautifully plated.  I like my Pad Thai with a little more kick, so would request that next time around.   The Kung Pao was PERFECT!  I highly, highly recommend this dish. 

Dessert:  Well, as if we hadn't had enough yet - we let ourselves get talked into the chocolate cake.   Oh my!  It was a delicacy!   This massive slice of chocolatey goodness was a 4 or 5 layer cake with a fruity filling (strawberry or raspberry?), a creme layer, another chocolate creme layer and a fabulous icing.  It was quite decadent.  

Vietnamese iced coffee and lemonade were also enjoyed!   

We took home 4 to go boxes (papaya salad, pad thai, kung pao, and chocolate cake!), so the portions are definitely generous.  The food was not heavy so we left feeling satisfied. 

The staff were friendly and attentive. The prices were so affordable, this is definitely a place that can be a regular go-to spot!   LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Asian food!!    It's vegetarian, but many of the dishes have fake meat and all have wonderful sauces and preparations. Vegetarian, vegan, or carnivore, you'll think this place is delicious.  

The Rainbow Wonder is fabulous: heavenly, aromatic garlic ginger sauce with vegetables that are fresh and flavorful, plus colorful for a lovely presentation.  The Pad Thai and the Kung Pao are also deliciously prepared and impossible to resist!  

The service is friendly and prompt, and the place itself is cute and bright."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is so good! Definitely my favorite Thai food now! The lunch portions are small but the food is so fresh and delicious! I'm a vegan and they have PLENTY great vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options and they taste AMAZING! I hardly ever do reviews on yelp but this place was just beyond my expectations! Great service! Clean restaurant! Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Try the kungpao, Mongolian or pho! All savory and filling. Garlic noodles toddler approved! Lunch special is moderately priced and so darn good. Brought my omni father in law and he wants to go EVERYTIME he visits us in Az. Says he can't tell the difference. My only complaint is that the desserts aren't vegan."}
{"text":"Very good Kosher, vegan restaurant.  The owners are Jewish and Vietnamese, they lived in Hawaii and therefore their food is a little Hawaiian based.  There were 4 of us that ended up sharing 4 entrees so we could try a little of each. We had stuffed tomatoes, braised ribs, ginger soy chicken and pad thai.  All were exceptionally delicious.  You couldn't even tell the meat was imitation meat. The flavor was great and everything was made to order.  We had a big group so he put in a little bit of the orders at a time since they were freshly made.   I would highly recommend this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Fresh Mint rocks! Delicious food, a large variety of items on the menu, and it's all vegan except for the last entrée on the menu (#31 or #32 ?), which has egg noodles.

Their mock chicken is awesome! The perfect texture and chewiness. 

Their main course entrées are pretty large, so it's easy to split a meal with someone else.

Looking forward to going back to try some more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I walked into this restaurant. I just wanted to test out what the vegan and vegetarian scene was like in Arizona while vacationing. Initially when I walked in, no one greeted me and I walked to the counter. I was directed to a table, and the same guy who directed me there came back to take my order. The service started off a bit shaky. I asked him what exactly was the soy fish made out of. His response, \"A soy product.\" I was trying to get specifics: tempeh? tofu? TVP? For all I know it could've been made of seitan. I ignored the vague response and ordered the meal. The moment I tasted the first bite, I loved it. The waiter became much friendlier after I told him I loved the food. I'm not sure what the change of heart was, but I took it. That Soy Fish in a Clay Pot was delicious. The only downside was the restaurant doesn't have a good dessert option if you're vegan. It's real dairy cake. I'm not a big fan of tapioca pudding, especially with mandarin, but I gave it a shot. It's okay. Not great. It looks like snot to me, but it tastes all right. Would I go there again? Absolutely. I wouldn't order that tapioca ever again (and shouldn't have in the first place but I was trying to be adventurous), but it's a quaint restaurant, easy to travel to and even the lemonade was great."}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful food with top notch service.  I'm a meat and potatoes fan and this vegan restaurant is still a favorite!"}
{"text":"We found Fresh Mint while searching for vegetarian dining options in Scottsdale. It was a bit of a drive from where we were staying down on N. McDowell Road, but totally worth it!

The restaurant is a smallish (but very bright and cheerful) storefront operation in a large shopping complex a few miles north of downtown Scottsdale. The first thing that hits you, as you walk in, is \"wow...something smells fantastic!\" (always a good way to start a relationship with a restaurant!). Jasmine rice and ginger...one of my favorite combinations!

We chose to sit inside (there is what appears to be a good-sized patio seating area as well). I was very impressed by the décor, which was very bright, clean, and modern...despite the size and the location, it doesn't have the look or feel of a fast-food joint. Service was prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable.

It's always a bit overwhelming for us when we can eat anything on the menu without having to ask \"does this have meat in it?\" or \"is this cooked with fish sauce?\" so it took us a few minutes to decide what to have. We finally settled on an order of the fried imperial rolls to share. For our entrees, I went with the Golden Soy Chicken Delight (the words \"ginger sauce\" get me every time!) and my husband chose the Signature Lemongrass Curry (with the Japanese eggplant option rather than tofu). We were both pleased that they offer brown rice as an option (we'll eat white rice, but prefer brown).

Everything is prepared fresh to order there, so we'd expected service to be a bit slow, and were pleasantly surprised at how quickly our appetizer came out. The imperial rolls were absolutely delicious! The texture of the taro-based filling was perfect, and the slight sweetness was nicely off-set by the tasty, vinegary, sauce that was served alongside. A single order was perfect for two.

Our entrees came out shortly after we'd finished the imperial rolls, and it was love at first bite! I had planned to ask them if they make their own meat analogs and forgot, which is too bad, because the texture was unique and very pleasant (often meat analogs can have an unpleasantly chewy texture, but my \"chicken\" was nicely tender). The sauces were wonderful! Mine had a nice, gingery edge, and my husband's curry was deliciously complex, with a lovely lemony taste from the lemongrass.

Presentation was very attractive. If I have to nitpick, the one thing I would change is the ordering of the food on the plate. Both our entrees had the rice and the saucy, meaty stuff separated by a large \"dam\" of lightly steamed vegetables, which made it difficult to combine the entrée with the rice. The veggies were tasty and well-prepared, but there were too many of them and they were cut too large to make them easy to incorporate into the dish. I would suggest cutting them more finely and serving them on one side of the plate rather than between the rice and the \"meat.\" It's a very minor point, though.

The restaurant doesn't serve alcohol, so we both had tea with our meals. Soft drinks were also available.

One interesting thing, that some diners may want to know about...the restaurant is certified kosher! I overheard the owner speaking with a Jewish couple at a nearby table and evidently when they opened in the area, an early patron strongly advised them to get kosher certification, as there is a large Jewish community in that part of Scottsdale. It's nice to see a restaurant that is truly sensitive to the needs of the community in which it finds itself.

All in all, a very pleasant dining experience!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn amazing for a vegetarian menu! The owner was super friendly and I told her how much I love spicy fare.. she took care of me!!

I ordered the Kung Pao Soy Chicken.. you don't even miss the chicken at all.. nice and spicy sweet with LOADS of veggies!! Also ordered the Imperial Roll Noodles.. yummy! I didn't even miss the BBQ pork that usually comes with this dish elsewhere. Lots of pieces of egg rolls amongst fresh cabbage and rice noodles.. she also threw in some Thai chiles.. my mouth, my mouth, my mouth is on fire! 

Can't wait go come back!!"}
{"text":"(Take-out review )

Busy day schlepping all over the place today  i had an early lunch at Olive and Ivy, so,  i was hungry and didn't feel like cooking  .I have had Fresh Mint Bookmarked for awhile, so today was the day to give them a try .

They offer gf vegan which is why i had them bookmarked .I called in an order from my car and told them i could be there in half an hour to pick it up .( it was ready upon arrival)

Sweet and Sour soup was very decent from the GF menu ,The Lotus salad was amazing, super fresh,  and i loved the Vinaigrette (it was lightly citrus ) the cucumbers in this salad were so awesome because of how fresh and crisp they were .The whole salad was great, however, the cucumbers were dynamite. I also had cucumber rolls that were tasty and nicely done.

My $22 dinner for one was worth every penny - i loved how fresh everything tasted.
Friendly service on phone and at pick-up .

I don't know if i would dine in, I will however order take-out from here again."}
{"text":"My fiance is trying to eat healthier and avoid meat products so I'm trying my best to limit my meat consumption. We were in Scottsdale and found this nice little restaurant nearby. The service was a little slow but everyone was very friendly. The cucumber rolls with peanut sauce were delicious. The Golden Soy Chicken Delight was really good it was hard to believe the chicken was actually tofu. We will plan on visiting this restaurant again the next time we're on that side of town."}
{"text":"our tummies were so empty and we were getting ornery from furniture shopping and look there...fresh mint!
the sign said something about fresh and healthy food and our other options were greasy pizza, chinese, or fast food. the place is small but busy. very bright atmosphere and the owner was full of zeal. 
i ordered the stuffed tomato dish and she the papaya salad. both prepared made to order and did not disappoint. 

the crunchy and cool, sweet, yet sour salad was fabulouso, and then our hot dish, the tomatoes with brown rice were amazing. we were full after 3/4 of the way but our mouths craved more so we cleaned both plates and were off again to deal with furniture salespeople. 

very reasonable at 25 bucks for two. we wanted to try deserts as they all looked tasty but belly too full."}
{"text":"This is the BEST vegetarian food in town, bar none.  Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Consistent.  Fresh Mint offers a very consistent product. 

This is a vegetarian restaurant with a Kosher designationl. The menu is Asian, with traditional dishes served with tofu or just veggies.  The tofu is flavored/shaped as with it's more traditional dish (i.e. Kung Poa has chicken-flavored tofu, Beef dishes taste more like beef).  Personally, I prefer plain tofu over flavored and they will substitute to your taste.  Also, for GF'ers, they do have some dishes that are GF (no soy sauce--such as curries).  No upcharges for any subs or even brown rice...

At lunch, hardly a seat is available. It's nice to see that this is more crowded than the fast food joint that is closer to the street.  A slight tention can be felt for the business of the staff; however, this restaurant is consistant every time...it's worth trying folks."}
{"text":"I ordered the pad thai. it was pretty tasty. Seems to be a family run restaurant. Very nice staff, but they all looked overly stressed and hectic which I understand running a small business. If i'm ever in the area i'll check them out again but its just too far of a drive for me to stop by all the time."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers. Would not have found this place with out you. Supper was great, cucumber rolls, lemongrass curry and golden curry. Wait staff was pleasant and efficient. A go back to place."}
{"text":"After pondering whether or not I should try this place based on mixed reviews I'd heard, I decided to go for it today! I am usually not too into Asian food (except thai!), but I was interested in this completely vegetarian place.
My mom didn't really want to go but she was hungry and we were in the area so she gave in haha. But she ended up loving it, I think even more so than I did! I do have a few complaints, but it was nothing too bad. The service was very very slow. Three people working and not very many customers and we had to wait for quite a bit. Also every single soda was out, except diet coke. Luckily I don't drink soda, and the only thing my mom wanted was diet coke!
We seated ourselves but a server came to take our order pretty quickly. Restaurant was clean but nothing fancy. I started off with a jasmine iced tea and it was tasty. Subtle flavor, but I enjoyed it, the glass it came in was cool, almost like a beer glass haha. As for food I got the vegetable curry. I am not a huge fan of mock meat and my mom isn't either, but they had other options luckily! My curry came with tofu, potatoes, sweet potatoes, I think carrots, and there was a side of brown rice with more vegetables. Some of the vegetables mixed with the rice were almost like cold, was weird. Rice wasn't the best either. But the curry was fantastic! The perfect amount of spice for me. Plus I'm obsessed with sweet potatoes so that helps. My mom got some kind of dish that had eggroll type things on top of noodles. We were both obsessed with the noodles and couldn't stop eating them. We both left feeling very full, but glad to have had a relatively healthy meal with lots of fresh veggies and great flavor. I would certainly return, saw other people's food and thought dang I have to try that!"}
{"text":"I have a love affair with meat, but this vegan Thai place has given me a whole new perspective on tasty vegan. 

It's not that I have anything against tofu, I just can't cook it myself to make it actually taste good. Now I don't have to. I'll just take the family to Fresh Mint and have their yummy tofu instead! Surprisingly, they are not limited to tofu. I had the Kung Pao with \"pretend\" beef......HOLY COW! It was freakin' good!!! I honestly don't know if I could have guessed it wasn't beef if you hadn't told me. 

My husband had the Rainbow dish with \"pretend\" chicken. Again, wow! It actually tasted like good food.....good food that just happens to make your taste buds think they are eating chicken! His was a wee bit spicy for me, but infused with a great flavor nonetheless. The kids got a Pad Thai, and that was the only thing that was kind of bland. Whereas our other two dishes had AMAZING sauces, the Pad Thai could have used a little more \"umph\". 

Oooohhhh, and the summer rolls (one of my favorite Vietnamese appetizers) had tofu instead of the shrimp that is normally served. I didn't even miss those delicious little guys. Good peanut sauce, great fresh veggies, and a choice between white and brown rice help this newer eatery get my 4 stars. 

Now I know what to \"cook\" when my vegetarian father-in-law comes to town. We are dragging him to Fresh Mint!"}
{"text":"Flavorful, healthy, accommodating, great service nothing not to like about this delicious vegan cafe."}
{"text":"Great healthy food. Spicy Lemongrass tofu is so good. They have the best Thai tea EVER. They use coconut milk which I think is what makes it superior. Service is not good at all though.. It would be nice if they checked back after dropping off your food to see if you liked it or if you need anything . My \"server\" was more of an order taker and dropper off er"}
{"text":"Great food.  Good quality product.  Very clean.  Nice atmosphere.  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Everything was really, really fresh. It's made to order so don't expect to being in and out in 20 minutes. I was surprised how tasty their veg pho was. Everyone eating around me seemed to enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"This is the first place we tried when we moved to Phoenix, and we've been back many times since! 

Pros:
-Unique vegetarian dishes with beautiful flavors. 
-Fresh, FRESH vegetables
-Friendly service
-Seriously some of the most interesting and delicious vegetarian food I've had.

Cons:
-Can be a bit pricey
-Depending on the night, the service may be a bit slow. 

TL;DR: Go, it's worth it. Especially if you like fresh ingredients and veg food."}
{"text":"Excellent meal! We were happly surprised. The food was fresh, unique and beautifully presented. We'll be back."}
{"text":"2009-2010 The only problem is my stomach is too small. Every thing is delicious here. Dont every change, Fresh Mint, just multiply!

3/2011 Dinner was great and super fresh. Service was strained, as if our presence was an imposition. If you don't want customers, dont freakin open. Then, super disappointed. Ordered tapioca to go, the lady chef owner wrapped it up. Got home and it was soupy and old. Why would you give regulars runny tapioca? Gonna take a Fresh Mint break."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Fresh Mint! Their menu items are prepared when you order and are super fresh! Totally redeemed myself after eating naughty pancakes in the morning!

Tried the tofu spring rolls and they were delicious. The peanut sauce is like no other!!! You have to try! I practically drank what was left ;)"}
{"text":"This restaurant epitomizes why I feel sorry for vegetarians.  I am an omnivore and I am neither afraid nor put-off by the idea of an all veggie meal. 

I will say that the restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly but the food tends to be either bland or odd tasting and the service is painfully slow even when it is not busy. 

The only redeeming quality is that they cater to vegans (who don't know any better than to rate this 5 stars).  I guess it's working for them though."}
{"text":"This place is locally owned, has a lengthy menu, and serves fantastic vegan/vegetarian food. If you haven't been you seriously need to give it a try. One of my favorite restaurants for years."}
{"text":"I love eating here because everything is soooo delicious and the best part is that it's healthy!! No guilt here!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while since we don't live nearby, but made it a point to stop in last Thursday after seeing their establishment listed as a donator of proceeds from Thursday's sale to The Arizona Animal Welfare League. I love supporting businesses that support good causes!
Additionally, they have an excellent soy meat substitute that even the fiancé likes! So win-win-win! Very lovely couple that own and operate the restaurant and coolest thing is, the owner has the BEST music collection playing overhead. Somewhat random, definitely classics but so charming. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Decent Vegan food. I would give points for consistency, quality, and variety.
I like that I can get good healthy food here, but this is definitely not my first choice for vegan food. 
Few ingredients such as their soy based meat is pretty good. However, they can really work on improving overall taste of their entrées. 
Most of the entrées I tried have pretty much same type of base sauce, and same type of vegetables. some dishes are loaded with raw boiled vegetables (broccoli, zucchini is standard in all), which kind of offsets the taste. A little bit of seasoning or sautéed vegetables may work better.
their spring rolls are amazing, and their tapioca pudding dessert is great too."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! Super fresh, great tasting food! Lots of healthy vegetables."}
{"text":"Amazing food. If you are looking for a way to convert your significant other to looking into becoming a plant based eater or if you are dipping your toe into the Vegan pond, this would be my first stop. Most would never miss a bite of meat by trying the soy chicken Kung Pao. Give it a try. You will enjoy yourself no matter who you are."}
{"text":"This place. This place. Ohh this place. This place is an anomaly as far as restaurants go. Fresh innovative vegetarian cooking. And the service is extremely friendly. The food is reasonably priced but they have so many good things it's easy to spend a lot."}
{"text":"Place was dead on a Saturday night at 7pm. Now I know why. The food was horribly overpriced and the portions are small. $14 for 6 little pieces of soy chicken, vegetables, and brown rice?? C'mon. Spent $33 on takeout for 3 small portion items. Ate them all then fell ill the rest of the night from heartburn, indigestion, and bloating. First and LAST time to The Fresh Mint! Change your menu and portions or be closed by this time next year."}
{"text":"My mom and I drove up from Chandler to give this place a try.  When ever she's in town we try a veggie restaurant we haven't been to before.  Fresh Mint was well worth the drive!  We arrived around 2:30 pm and were greeted immediately by the owner.  He told us to take a seat where ever we wanted and he'd bring menus and silverware.  We sat outside.  We ordered the spring rolls to start and my mom got the Pho.  The spring rolls came out quickly and were oh so good!  My moms soup came out a few minutes later and it was quite large for the small.  We ended up sharing it and it was also really good.  We ordered the pepper steak and the hot pot...both to share.  The pepper steak was amazing!  The veggies were cooked to perfection and the sauce was pure yumminess.  It came with some roasted potatoes that were crispy on the outside and buttery soft on the inside.  I had never had a hot pot before.  I really didn't know what to expect. At first I didn't think it was as good as the pepper steak.  I think that's because it was in fact, extremely hot (temperature hot) and that took away from the flavor.  As it cooled down though, the flavors came through and it was every bit as good as the pepper steak.  There are so many other dishes I can't wait to try.  Great service, great food.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Absativley awesome! Let me say that I am a total meat eater but I went with my girlfriend last night to try it out (she's the vegetarian) and I ordered the soy Kung pow chicken. SO GOOD! I tasted no difference, we also ordered their lemonade, once again SO GOOD! 

The service was outstanding for a packed house! 

I will totally be returning"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here and do a review before heading over to my networking event. Warm inviting place, delicious scents of the spices used in the dishes teases your appetite as you enter through the door.   Mom and pop restaurant, eat here to support local businesses. Hubby is going the way of vegetarian and vegan so I will definitely be back with him and my son to try out this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Healthy and delicious doesn't always go together but at the Fresh Mint it describes most if not all of the menu.  I ordered the Rainbow Veggies with brown rice along with the sweet and sour soup.  Both were scrumptious.  Will definitely be back to visit whenever I am in or near Scottsdale."}
{"text":"For a small out of the way eatery, the food was so fresh and tasty. I am not a vegan but love to eat clean as often as possible. This is my kind of place.   The flavors were unique and the food was freshly made and nice and hot. I will definitely return to try more of the menus. Loved the fried rice, Thai ice tea and green papaya salad!  Oh forgot the wonderful Thai sweet and sour soup - yum!  Highly recommend it for take out also."}
{"text":"Great Asian vegetarian restaurant for those looking for alternative to loving Hut. Lots of flavors in the citrus spare rib. Good service and clean on top of great food. I'll return to try the pho."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Healthy and Yummy and the owners are the best!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First off, I am not a vegetarian of any sort, but I do appreciate having vegetarian meals on occasion. So that said, this is a pretty good option regardless of whether you eat meat or not. The service was friendly and attentive, and the food was tasty. I'll come back and try out some of the other items on the menu--there are a bunch that sound great!

I came by myself and was immediately seated at lunch time. The service was very friendly and attentive throughout lunch and was helpful in suggesting some items on the menu that were good. I ended up ordering the pad thai, which includes some vegetables and tofu on rice noodles. The lunch order includes a side salad, and all at a very affordable rate.

The salad was very fresh and had a really tasty dressing. I couldn't place the flavors, but it was one of the better vinaigrettes I've had in a while. The pad thai was also quite tasty, even without meat. :P I would have appreciated some more vegetables on there, but the flavors were really good, and the noodles were done perfectly. The server had recommended this and the kung pao \"chicken\"; I'll be back to try the latter at some point.

Excellent service, tasty food, very affordable."}
{"text":"So far I've visited twice. It's across from my vegan salon studio, so it works out great to run over and grab some vegan food for lunch or dinner between clients. The spring rolls with peanut sauce are great. My husband had soy beef pho that was really good. Today I tried the eggplant. It had really good flavor. It takes about 15 min for to go food when it's not super busy, but about 30 minutes during busy times. It's all fresh, so it takes a little longer. Yum."}
{"text":"OK I'm a little bit addicted to this place. I eat lunch there at least twice a week. The food is always amazing! It's a super adorable family friendly restaurant. I love the fact the it is literally family owned. Husband is your server and wife is the cook and everything on the menu rocks! The tapioca pudding is the best!"}
{"text":"Their food is normally very good and I really like this place a lot. Their food is all vegetarian and a lot of it is vegan or can be made vegan. Their kung pao soy chicken is amazing and my husband and I have gotten it more than once. I went there tonight and got their chow mein. It was pretty gross. It was a bowl of water with some sauce mixed in and noodles and veggies. It would have been really good if the bowl wasn't filled with water. I asked the waiter if he could drain some of the water out and he asked if I meant the sauce. Definitely wouldn't recommend that dish."}
{"text":"Sooooo good every time! The fried rice is my favorite. Thai iced tea is also a must have!"}
{"text":"My husband and I, visiting here from Washington, D.C., had a mixed experience at Fresh Mint. We both ordered soups (Pho and Fresh Garden Vegetable Soup) that were meh -- we were expecting bolder broths. Note that the \"small\" soups are actually huge portions. Luckily, the entrees were better. We each had tofu curries that were yummy and satisfying.The Golden Curry Vegetables is excellent, while the Fresh Lemongrass Tofu was solidly good. 

My husband used to manage restaurants, and he and I agree that the single thing that Fresh Mint could do to improve its restaurant is hire more employees. There seemed to be one hot cook, one cold prep cook, and one waiter (the owner, we think) for the entire restaurant, which was full at lunch hour. It took us 90 minutes for lunch from the time we walked in to the time we got our check -- too long for a weekday lunch. We were especially surprised that it took almost 30 minutes to get the soup appetizers, which are all pre-made, out of the kitchen. We had a leisurely schedule, but other diners might not. If you have the option of dining at Fresh Mint during non-rush times, it might be a better bet. The food was good, but we'd have to seriously weigh whether to make a return trip based on the time it took us to get served. 

I couldn't find Fresh Mint's Web site with a Web search before I went there, but it's http://freshmint.us.com."}
{"text":"Came here for some vegan food and will definitely come back! The owner served me the food and was very friendly and attentive. His wife cooks the food and uses fresh, healthy ingredients from what I could tell. I had the pad Thai and would definitely get it again. I loved that everything on the menu was vegan besides two items."}
{"text":"Definitely a solid lunch time choice. I should note, I did not dine-in, but I got the vegetable curry to-go. Oh my. Pleasantly surprised, the curry wasn't too spicy, just right. The salad that comes with the lunch special, was simple but had amazing flavor, and they gave me the choice of brown or white rice. The lunch special cost me about $8.74 (including tax). 

I hadn't really read any reviews on yelp or other sites, just looked at the star count on Urbanspoon. I decided to take a leap of faith on this place, and I was definitely NOT disappointed. Will be returning and trying some of their other dishes.

For right now, as it's what I had for lunch. I would definitely recommend the Golden Vegetable Curry. It's the right amount of food, without stuffing your stomach too full. I also feel like I made a good healthy decision by eating here instead of fast food, however, my order only took about 10 minutes to make (so still pretty damn fast). 

One last thing, this place is vegan. They serve soy beef and soy chicken for some dishes, but there is no meat. I am giving them 4 stars for right now, as I have only tried one dish, but so far I'm impressed."}
{"text":"The golden curry is absolutely delicious. It is my favorite thing to get on a rainy Arizona day. I have only been there a handful of times, but it is a must-visit whenever I visit my parents in the valley. Good food, nice atmosphere, friendly staff. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My second time here was as good as the first.   This place seats about 40 people but only three booths.  The rest are 4 top tables with about 4 tables on the patio.  This place is nothing special to look at, located on a pad in a strip shopping center but, the food is very, very good.

Tonight we had the spring rolls, summer rolls, pad thai, and kung pao chicken.  All the dishes were just perfect with the fresh vegetables cooked to perfection.  Portions are generous and the price is right.

This is a vegetarian joint so be aware, the chicken is NOT chicken.  It is run by a husband and wife team out of Hawaii (wife cooks, husband serves)and they definitely have their following of regulars.  The muzak is 60s-70s generation which I enjoyed.

Great value, great food.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Comprehensive menu with all vegetarian friendly choices.  Everything is incredibly fresh, and the lemongrass curry is great. Vietnamese iced coffee is a must.  Bright, clean, owner is super personable and friendly.  We've gone well out of our way to have dinner here."}
{"text":"Love the food here! It's always made fresh and delicious. The eggplant is my personal fave!  If you're in search of a yummy vegan place to eat you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you're traveling in Phoenix, Google \"Scottsdale vegan restaurant\" and find Fresh Mint, it's important to know they strangely deep fry many of their dishes without telling you that on the menu. For example, ordered what I thought was a lemongrass, bean curd, tofu, seaweed and sesame stir fry, and what I got was a deep fried ball of bean curd and tofu with some steamed veggies as a side. It was odd and totally defeated the purpose of my trip, which was to find a fresh, plant based lunch."}
{"text":"This place could have been amazing, I'll never know.

My husband, who is vegetarian/vegan, and I, being Vietnamese, thought this would be a great place to try during our visit to PHX this past weekend. 

The trouble started when the owner, a white man, asked me why I didn't have a \"vietnamese nose\". I was taken aback, and did not know how to respond. I said, \"what do you mean?\" he replied, \"you know, wider and flatter. You know, my wife is Chinese and raised in Vietnam.\" I was flabbergasted. I mean, I know he wasn't intending to be hurtful or borderline racist or whatnot, but it really bothered me that he felt he could say this to a complete stranger, let alone a patron in his restaurant, and that he felt justified simply because his wife is asian?? All I could muster up was \"uhhh you'll find that people can look a variety of ways.\"  

I don't know, even though he apologized, my husband and I were left with a very bad taste in our mouths and we ended up leaving before we could order. 

The owner was just weird, unprofessional, and inappropriate. It doesn't matter if the food is good, we weren't even able to get to that point.  It all turned out great though, because we ended up going to Green (see my review) that was close by, and it ended up being even better."}
{"text":"Fresh Mint may be my favorite vegetarian restaurant in town. However, it's important to note that it is not 100% vegan, and the menu doesn't mark the non-vegan items but I believe it is just the shell of the imperial rolls (egg rolls). Ask before ordering!

Beyond that - Fresh Mint is one of the rare veg. restaurants in town that clearly make every meal with love. I say that, because I've observed Chef Mai Ly and her husband for many years, and the tenderness and respect they have for each other is so touching. 

While I've had many favorite items over time, my current go-to is the  veggie kabob to start, with the golden soy chicken delight for my entree. The kabobs are all about the BBQ peanut sauce - it's lick-the-plate good. I might actually try to get a different starter served with it next visit, because I love all of the rolls, but the regular peanut sauce is just good, not amazing.

Fresh Mint uses a lot of \"mock meats\" but to me they are much better than the mock meats served in other restaurants in town. The \"chicken\" in the golden soy chicken delight is thinly sliced and textured like real chicken - including a bumpy skin! It's almost too real! But the most important part is how it absorbs the soy ginger sauce. I worship this sauce. It's slightly sweet, but has the ginger snap to it. It's served with bountiful steamed rice (or brown if you prefer) which I use to mop up the left-over sauce. It's also served with fresh, lightly steamed broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, squash and carrots. I eat those if I get around to it at the end... 

Other favorite items include the fresh cucumber rolls, the spicy lemongrass noodle soup (especially if you have a cold!), the sesame soybean, the spicy ginger soy beef (probably my 2nd favorite entree), the black pepper steak, and the stir fried noodles. I used to get the chow mein all the time, but then I found out the crispy noodles its served on (like a bird's nest) are not vegan. I could still get it with soft noodles, but that would be less fun.

My husband loves the fresh lemongrass tofu - which is a very unique dish. It's little pinwheels of rolled tofu and seaweed, served with a ginger sauce.

For desert, anything with their tapioca is great, but ask to make sure it's vegan (if you are a plant-based diner). I think the fritters may not be vegan.

Service is usually great, unless they are slammed. Mai Ly's husband Michael is usually the only waiter, or sometimes he has a couple of people to help in both the front and back ends of the restaurant. Mai Ly makes everything to order, so don't expect instant delivery, but I've never waited excessively. Expecting a little wait is also a good excuse to get an appetizer! The restaurant is clean and casual, and for some reason their water tastes very good to me. Maybe they add cucumber?

In summary - if you are vegan, vegetarian or veg-curious and want a healthy, flavorful meal, give them a try! Mock meats can be a challenge for some people, but they have plenty of veg-only or tofu items as well to pick from. And Michael can help you find something on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Clean, personable service and the food is fresh and excellent prepared. Owner plays some great background music. A casual dining experience."}
{"text":"It was quite expensive ($60 with tip for two for lunch).  The cucumber rolls were good, they came with a really tasty peanut sauce, but the main dishes were a disappointment for the price, not very flavorful, something I could whip up at home on a week day.

Fresh squeezed lemonade was good, but also on the expensive side at $3.95/glass - and not a large water glass, but a goblet.

Oh, and to start off the meal, there was lipstick on my water glass. Ugh"}
{"text":"OMG my first review!

I've been trying to cut meat out of my diet lately, and I keep driving by this place on the way to and from work.  When I finally made it there, I was slightly surprised by what I found.

The ambiance is somewhat odd, and not in the \"odd but quirky and cool\" sense you get from other vegan restaurants.  It's got kind of a strip mall chic feel to it, and the fifties music playing in the background made me feel like I got dropped in some bizarro \"Back to the Future\" scene, but the food was great and the couple that owns the place was really friendly!

I went on a Tuesday evening and I was the only one there--the place was dead.  It gave me pause at first, but the appetizer I ordered (Fried Imperial Rolls) was excellent, although the portions were small.  The vegetarian dipping sauce (whatever that is) was especially good.  For my meal I ordered Golden Soy Chicken--and although it looked like the same rubbery soy chicken substitute you might buy at the grocery store, it actually tasted like chicken!  The scrumptious citrusy ginger flavor of the sauce really made the dish, though.  The veggies seemed a bit more for garnish than for actual consumption, but they were ok, too.

The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5?  You pay too much for the size portions you get.  I had an appetizer and an entree and I still left not quite full.  I'm thinking I'll have to try this place for lunch sometime, since I work only right down the road."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I love that it's a full menu of vegetarian cuisine. The atmosphere of the restaurant is super cute too. Wish I lived closer so I could order take out once and a while"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the pad thai. So good!"}
{"text":"Fresh Mint is calling my name and I shall answer yet again!
I've been there numerous times and everything I have ever had has been wonderful!  
My favorite is the green papaya salad, mmm crunchy peanut-y scrumptiousness!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty food. Soy chicken was better than real chicken ;-) completely vegetarian... A rare option!  Very friendly staff too!!"}
{"text":"I eat at Fresh Mint a few times a week. It's the best place ever. Amazing food. Nice family running it. Affordable. And VEGAN so more ethical!  Thank you Fresh Mint!"}
{"text":"Only tried this place once but my dish was great. Soy chicken pad Thai. Hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"The autumn rolls and pho were fantastic!  The time before we tried the summer rolls which were okay, but needed something more like fresh pineapple.  It was just cabbage in a rice paper roll.  I love that there are so many healthy, tasty options, but I must say the atmosphere is really lacking and reminded me of a kid's playroom with the fluorescent green walls and the giant purple mint leave on the wall.  Despite this with limited vegan and vegetarian options in Scottsdale, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything we've tried has been delicious, reasonably priced, and beautifully presented. This is a new favorite spot for us and worth the drive. They have vegan pho! Wish they had more vegan desserts."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always fresh, delicious, and made to order so it comes out piping hot. Since it is made to order, it can take awhile to get your food, but have patience. It is well worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and full of flavor.  The fresh steamed vegetables are crisp and bright and offered with most dishes.  The food preparation is a bit slow compared to other small places, but they really seem to put care into preparing a quality dish.  The owner is very friendly and sometimes talks to the customers.  I wish they had a few more kid-friendly dishes that would make it easy for my kids to enjoy the food.  Like a dish with noodles and a sweet sauce and some fresh tofu and veggies on top."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Fresh Mint today and I loved it.  I had wanted to try this place and glad I did.  The service was wonderful as was the food.

I had Lemongrass Tofu Delight and boy was there a lot of food.  I took some of it home for lunch tomorrow.

I am not a vegetarian but I do eat Gluten-free and they had a menu for that with a lot of selections.

I would recommend Fresh Mint."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I frequent this place often. Their dishes are tasty and filling. Everything is fresh and made right when you order it!"}
{"text":"Owners treat everyone like their most valued customers.  They are friendly, chatty and genuinely warm and welcoming.  Nothing is ever a problem.

The food is wonderful and they do very creative things with meat substitutes.  Generous portions, excellent prices, high quality dishes that are served pleasing to the eye, nose and mouth.  

Great to have a top notch Kosher place in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"So I gave Fresh Mint another try Friday night. My girlfriend got the Golden Soy Chicken, I got the Kung Pao. Service was great and friendly as usual. Another bonus is that brown rice is not more! Everyplace now charges more for the \"unmolested\" rice(if they even have it) and it's ridiculous.

Both dishes were great, the portions turned out to be perfect. Everything had good flavor, the Kung Pao was weak heat wise for me but will be perfect for most.

 The only reason this does not get 5 stars on my update is that it is a Vegan Thai/Vietnamese/Whatever place on the Phoenix/Scottsdale line with high end LA Vegan place prices. My Kung Pao was $14 dollars. It is one of the more expensive things on the menu but I had gotten other things and they had just been ok. 

If prices were a tad more reasonable then this place would be 5 stars for sure. I understand people need to make a living and you don't go into business to not make a profit but think of other Vegan places in the valley and their prices."}
{"text":"This place is great. 
Always fresh and consistent. I enjoy going here for lunch, it's relatively quick, conveniently located and very consistent. 
Look... Service is not their strong suit, good food is. I wish I could give them all five stars, but it appears the owner takes care of everyone himself. When the place is a little full the service suffers a bit. He makes up for it with a pleasant demeanor and knowledge of the menu though so I'm not sure I would change a thing. 
My favorite is the spring rolls. Great app or as a light entree. Any of the dishes on the menu are a home run though. Like I said, overall the place is great and I enjoy it. 
Worth a visit, even if your not vegetarian. It definitely crosses over to all palates."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. As a meat eater I am very impressed with the assortment of \"meat type\" soy products."}
{"text":"Really, really impressed. I travel to Scottsdale often for work and am always looking for great delivery since the house we are put up at is a bit far from walking distance. Came across this place on yelp and am so glad I tried it. 

Kung pao soy chicken - amazing!
Golden soy chicken delight - delicious!
Summer spring rolls - refreshing on hot summer nights!

I have a mushroom allergy and they told me they'd refund my soup order as it had mushroom powder - very thoughtful and great attention to detail in ensuring I was a happy customer. 

Order to delivery was less than 60mins and the lady who brought my delivery was so sweet. The whole experience was great. Will definitely order from here every time I'm in town! Thanks for going out of your way for me. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am breaking a personal rule and reviewing this after the first visit!  My housemates and I went and we ate half of the items listed on the menu, so it was like visiting several times.

We had imperial rolls for starters. Lemongrass soy beef noodles, papaya salad, hotpot, stuffed tomatoes.  Fresh Mint special lemonades for our drink.  Then we finished with mango tapioca and banana fritters.

After a debauched weekend, I thought this might be a good place to get back on track and eat a healthy, nice vegetarian meal.  As you can tell from what we ordered, the debauchery continued!

The imperial rolls were amazing for not having any meat in it!  No loss of flavor whatsoever.  I did notice a difference in texture, but it wasn't bothersome.  

The papaya salad had to be one of the best dishes we ordered.  It had the right amount of crunch on the fruit.  The dressing was also well balanced and was not too spicy with chili, or salty with fish sauce or sour with lemon, and just the hint of sweetness.  The addition of Thai basil gave it a refreshing finish.  Just wondering though, if they used fish sauce at all...being vegetarian...hmmm.

My next favorite has to be the hotpot.  A super hot ceramic bowl filled with sizzling brown rice and vegetables with a sauce that just imparts flavor without being obnoxiously present.  The vegetables were not overcooked, the rice was starting to crust at the bottom and the sauce brought it all together.

You have to go and taste for yourself. It's really good.  At our visit, Fresh Mint was staffed by a father-daughter team, with daughter at the back of the house.  Dad, as the server, was friendly and inviting, and paid just the right amount of attention to us.

My rec is to go with friends who don't mind sharing, and order tons of food."}
{"text":"Very healthy meals. The meal was cooked so well making me clean the plate easily. Thai iced tea is really good! We got summer sorting rolls for appetizer and it was so fresh and mouthful. Gorgeous setup as well. I had #17 and my partner had the pad Thai. It was delicious and the vegetables were completely fresh! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelpers, for steering me to yet another great restaurant in the valley. 

I was worried about taking my parents here - especially my father as he has a limited palate and prefers standard meat & potato dishes, but flavor and presentation of everything quickly quelled those fears.

We started with appetizers - summer rolls with peanut sauce (quite tasty), vegetable soup with mint (I did not try this but my father said it was very good) and BBQ peanut veggie shiskebabs. The kebabs were one of two standouts of the evening, bursting with mouth-watering flavor. Oh so good. 

I ordered the golden curry, one of a small handful of gluten-free dishes here. (The lemongrass curry is also GF; will be trying that next time). Abundant with flavor, it was way different than the usual Vietnamese yellow curry dishes I've had. This was sweeter and there was a particular spice used that tasted almost Indian. Cardamom, perhaps? 

My father ordered the Kung Pao soy chicken, which had a little too much heat for him, but he ate it anyway because it was so tasty. He kept remarking throughout the meal how colorful the food was. Yes, isn't it amazing what colors vegetables come in, Dad? Yellow! Red! Orange! Green! Purple, even! Obviously, vegetables are not part of my father's standard fare.

My mom had a basic stir-fry (Rainbow something?) which she was quite impressed by. Portions were ample as other reviewers have stated, with the owner telling us he did not want people to leave hungry.

For a table of 4, with appetizers, entrees and a pot of tea, our bill came to $76. This was the other standout of the evening. As my father was getting out his wallet, he was told not to bother. Another patron had paid our entire bill. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried the kung pao soy chicken to go.  The lunch special comes with a scoop of rice, and small portion of salad.  The outstanding feature is the flavorful sauce which complements the soy chicken and veggies very well.  The veggies and chicken themselves are prepared very well.  The veggies are not too hard or soft, and the chicken is tender.  While the mock chicken was good, I still could detect that it was faux chicken in texture and taste."}
{"text":"Very tasty soy dishes that taste just like meat. The vegetables are fresh. The service is friendly. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"VEGAN PHO and Thai Tea! If I lived near Fresh Mint, I think I could easily eat there everyday. Everyone in my party was super happy. The lunch specials were amazing values and the food was flavorful and full of fresh herbs. I put the some of the pound of thai basil that came with my pho into my pocket, so I could sniff it all day. :)"}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite place. As a vegan the food is spectacular, the rolls, the soup the vegan pepper steak mmmmmm. 

But I must admit the service is pretty awful expect to wait and wait and wait. Expect to get thirsty because getting a drink let alone a refill is nearly impossible. 

If the owner is working he tries but always seems overwhelmed. If the waitress they have is working you should bring your own drink and don't expect anything more than a head nod. She is as pleasant as a brick wall. 

But the food, oh that food .  . .  it's worth it!"}
{"text":"All dishes are absolutely delicious. Most memorably, try the coconut tapioca dessert. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I can mow through a cow so I am in no way a vegan but I met a friend here for lunch and I was sincerely impressed.  I ordered the Pad Thai and it comes mildly spicy but I had them kick it up to medium and it was fantastic and the salad that came before the meal was fresh and flavorful as well.  I was in and out of the door in 30 minutes, too!  We got there at 11:30 and after 11:45 it filled up pretty quickly so if you are in a hurry, go early."}
{"text":"Service is really slipping here. They seem to be more preoccupied with their take out business  than the people who are actually sitting at tables in their restaurant.


Two groups walked out already and for those trying to grab lunch during work they are really missing the mark."}
{"text":"Ok, first off, it has to be known that I am not anywhere near of being a vegan.  I love my filet mignon, chicken piccante, and sea bass.  But I am always up for trying new things and my friend wanted to meet their last night for dinner, so I was game.

I was pleasantly surpised with my choices...though i wished I ordered what my friend ordered.  (I ordered a lemongrass seaweed tofu thing, that I cannot remember the name of it for the life of me)  She even said she liked my entree much better than her Vegetarian Spare Ribs (which I though was AMAZING) I also ordered cucumber rolls, since I saw that it had white radishes in them (YUM)  

So, now I know one thing...I have a distaste for Tofu.  But I will not hold it against the establishment since it isn't their fault.  But it was their fault that I was sweating like a pig in that place.  

The staff was very nice and helpful.  The server had great suggestions for entrees."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and it has never disappointed. I've tried many of the roles and they are all light and refreshing. I typically like to try new things when I go to restaurants but I love the lemongrass tofu too much to stray from it. The owner's are super friendly and lovely people and I'm glad they settled AZ"}
{"text":"Fresh Mint is definitely a vegetarian's restaurant.   For a meat eater, not so much. However, I wanted fresh veggies so I thought I would finally check out the joint.   I ordered the spring rolls and Pad Thai.   Love the spring rolls! Fresh veggies with tofu wrapped in rice paper and cut into nice pieces which makes it easy to eat.  The peanut sauce was really good.  Pad Thai came out steaming hot!  However, taste wise I prefer a Thai pad thai, meaning spicy! Spicy missing from the noodle dish.  It was still good, sweet, and perfectly cooked veggies however, it needed a kick!  Not bad, I will still try another dish there another lunch time, the pho looked good."}
{"text":"Have been dining at Fresh Mint for years and the food is just delicious. Great soup/entrees/dessert and super-fresh ingredients. The owners and their children are there running the place and cooking the food and take great pride in the final product. I definitely go there for the food, the value and to support this family-owned business. 

As for the recent ratings complaining about the 2 hour wait I can say this is impossible. In addition, if someone spent $60 on lunch for 2 here it would mean they both had an appetizer, entree, drink and dessert and had to be wheeled out in a cart they were so full. I'd like to see you go anywhere in Scottsdale and have a 3 course meal with really tasty beverage and the same quality food they serve at Fresh Mint for $60.

Do yourself a favor. Try it for yourself, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Ok, the reviews are pretty spot on about the Papaya green salad.

This was an excellent experience. I think I was here 3 different times over the weekend, I was that impressed.

Servings were quite healthy (for a hearty eater like me), the Green Papaya was everything people said it would be and more.

Fresh and invigorating. 

On my second visit I had the curry. And this is what I liked so much about it: a fine combination of strong flavors that was not overwhelming. You can really taste the different herbs and spices that are in the plate, instead of just bland watered down curry. Very nice!

 And the lemongrass noodle soup... I think I have found a new comfort food!

The good news was that this place was very close to my hotel and made my stay that much more enjoyable. The bad news is that I am going to have a hard time finding the exact same tastes back home, and I will have to come back for some more (or learn the damn recipes!)"}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a whim just the other day and, not being a vegan or a vegetarian, but liking Asian style food in general, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was far from disappointed by the end of the meal! 

Arriving early for the lunch hour, there wasn't much of a crowd, but the place did fill up in short order. From what I could overhear from the interaction with the owner, it seemed like many of them were regulars, which was reassuring. After all, if those people keep coming back, they must be doing something right! 

Service was pleasant and not overly pretentious, just a tad slow at times. Yes, there could have been more smiles or slightly faster service, but it was a one person operation for much of the time I was there (it seemed like other servers showed up later?) so I can sympathize to a degree, at least. 

As to the food, I have to say, I was quite surprised. The appetizer, the imperial rolls, was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely be ordering it again in the future, without a doubt! I could have eaten more, it was that good! For the lunch itself, I went with one of their specials, the soy mongolian beef dish. Having had mongolian beef at many an Asian restaurant in the last few years, I've been all over the spectrum from authentic and delicious to Americanized and bland, and was pleasantly surprised to find the soy version at Fresh Mint surpassed many of the better, real beef versions I'd had. This stuff was good, to the point where I probably wouldn't have been able to tell it was soy-based. Everything on the plate, all the garnishing, was extremely fresh and the sauce was absolutely perfect, balancing everything out nicely. 

I would definitely go back, and often. The food was excellent, the atmosphere was quaint and unique, and, at least for lunch, the price was right. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fresh Mint. Fresh Food. Not so fresh service. 

I came here with my gluten-free, vegan girlfriend and we we're surprised to find how many options that they had for her on the menu. The food was pretty outstanding, the portions aren't too big or too small, and the prices are fair. I ordered the pho soup and the Mongolian Soy beef. Don't hesitate to order their soy meats, they're the best that I've tried so far! 

As for the service, our experience wasn't great. Our waiters weren't very friendly and the food took a good while to get to us. The manager later came up to us and apologized. It's a pretty small restaurant so expect slower service during the busy lunch and dinner hours. However, the quality of food in our opinion outweighed the poor service. 

Overall would recommend to everyone, not just the vegan community!"}
{"text":"Although it's on Scottsdale Rd I must admit it'd be easily overlooked given it's located in the center of a strip mall.  The dining area is small but bright.  Upon entering at lunchtime I found a full house but was welcomed with a smile.  Thankfully there was a small table in the rear that was perfect for me since I was dining alone.

Per their website, Fresh Mint puts a Vietnamese twist on regular vegetarian dishes.  All of their dishes are 100% vegetarian and made only when ordered to guarantee freshness. 

Although I could order off of the regular menu I was grateful for the lunch menu that offered several of their main dishes for a lunch time price, which also helped me narrow down my entree of choice. One drawback I found is that the regular dinner prices of entrees cost up to  $14, which is more expensive than I'd like to pay for the location and ambiance of Fresh Mint.  This is not necessarily something that would keep me from eating here but I would definitely keep in mind. Maybe I'll just stick to lunch.

Ultimately I chose the Kung Pao Soy Chicken that contains spicy classic Kung Pao sauce with garlic, white and green onions, soy chicken, zucchini, bell pepper, carrots and peanuts

I patiently waited for my food while I enjoyed watching the hustle and bustle of the lunchtime crowd.  In addition, my seat was located right next to the bar where the rolls and salads were being prepared.  Soon my lunch arrived.
I've found that I prefer my tofu pretty well done and not squishy inside, so I'm always hesitant to try new dishes...but my tofu was done perfectly!  With that being said, I'm sure you're not surprised that I ate every morsel of food on my plate."}
{"text":"Ok, lemme get this straight.  A vegan restaurant, on my side of town, and it's delicious?!?  It's like a dream come true!

I had the Golden Soy Chicken Delight and it was wonderful.  Thin slices of  \"chicken\" in a ginger & green onion sauce with rice and steamed veggies.  My fella had the Vegetable Fried Rice which was a huge plate of rice, veggies and tofu.  We shared a sweet, icy glass of mint lemonade too.  Mmmmm, it was all so good and I can't wait to go back!

Update:  I've been back twice since my original review.  I had the Golden Soy Chicken again, and the Pho.  My husband and I also shared some chocolate cake.  Everything was so good!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is such a refreshing discovery in North Scottsdale!  The food is incredible, it is definitely my new favorite vegan restaurant and I have frequented many in the Phoenix area including Green, The Loving Hut, and others.  This is definitely my favorite for several reasons.  First, the chef is amazing (it is the owner) and her husband actually served us our food.  They are from Hawaii and the restaurant itself is a warm, friendly, welcoming environment for everyone.  The food was high quality for more than reasonable prices and was very filling.  I eat ALOT so that was imporatant to me as I sometimes leave vegan restaurants still hungry. I would also feel very comfortable taking all of my carnivore friends to this restaurant as I believe they would be unable to tell the difference between the delicious vegan protien (faux meat) and the real thing.  In fact, I believe we will be hosting our carnivore friends for Thanksgiving and offering prepared food from this restaurant as an option at dinner- it is that tasty! The chef's husband personally delivered our food, was very friendly and initiated very nice conversation with my partner and I.  We truly felt welcomed and will be returning weekly unless something can beat this!  It should be noted that I have very little time on here to write reviews and specifically joined this site because I felt so strongly about promoting this restaurant through an online review that I created an account!  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with Fresh Mint. It is not the best Veggie food I have ever had and the service left a little to be desired, but I enjoyed my meal and the decor of the restaurant.

I ended up having the carmelized fish and my boyfriend had the kung pow chicken. Both were flavorful and cooked perfectly. I had jamsmine iced tea and was never offered a refill, which sucked, because it was really good.

Oh, yeah, we started off with the Pho which was really really good. It had fake beef in it and was sweeter then normal Pho but was really really tasty. I would go back just for the soup.

The bathrooms were really nice. That normally doesnt matter to people but i really liked them so I figured I would point it out

Overall it was a good experience and I will definitely be back. There were a lot of different dishes I wanted to try, especially after all of the comments about the chicken being so good."}
{"text":"Vegan food exists in Scottsdale Arizona although you may have to search for it between the PF Chang's and Cheesecake factories, it's still there. Mint Leaf has excellent food options and great service and the owner dishes out an occasional trivia question while you're waiting for your food.  I had the tofu rolls, soooo YUM!!!"}
{"text":"A friend took me over to this place I had Thai Pad it was good very fresh not as super as my friend described. The service was slow it was Saturday about 4pm. It seems like they need more help. I definitely will be back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food! Nice atmosphere. Summer and spring rolls really tasty. Stir fry noodles were also a favorite. Great for vegetarians. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Good Stuff!  We will be back!! The server helped with recommendations and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"I really did enjoy this place. I was reading reviews and noticed quite a few people comment on wait time and lack of service. Luckily, we didn't have any such issues the night we dined in. We waited appx 8-10 minutes for our food. We had the yellow curry and the Imperial Roll Noodles. Yellow curry was good - but it lacked a certain flavor. Satisfying in the sense that it was filling, but not in the sense of authenticity. I definitely can name a few other places I'd rather have curry at. The noodle bowl was on point - loved that they didn't skimp on the veggie rolls. Could've used a little more vinegar sauce though - split between the salad and the actual noodles - it needed just a bit more. I suppose I could've asked... ha! 

Service was fine. Nothing too special, but not lacking either. The person whom I assumed was the manager served as the hostess and the person checking people out. He was mostly attentive.

Honestly, this place is a wonderful idea. There's a lot of tasty sounding dishes on the menu and one's that honestly I'd love to come back and try. Prices aren't crazy by any means, but $15 for any of the Chef's Specials - I sorta shrug my shoulders at because they don't seem THAT amazing. Like c'mon, $15 for veg chow mein?? I think I'd rather go to an authentic Chinese restaurant and get my pan fried noodles for $8. Hot pot might be worth it - but the mock meat dishes- not so much. 

We definitely want to come back, but it's not at the top of the list..."}
{"text":"I have tried most of the dishes on the menu and appreciate the consistency and quality with my many experiences here. The lunch special which includes a salad, entrée and rice is a good value at $8ish. I especially like the pad thai and lemon grass dishes. Keep up the good work Michael and family!"}
{"text":"Delicious small diner style restaurant. I had the Golden Curry Vegetables. Excellent!!  Will be back."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars because I do think the food is good, but the Service is really bad.  Been there 3x now and each time we've waited over 25 minutes to receive our food, and the orders are always mixed up.  The staff seems disorganized and not professional servers.  That being said, some of their dishes are very tasty.  But due to service, we don't enjoying dining here."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian.  I was in the area and wanted Pho.  I was skeptical of the \"Vegetarian Pho\" but decided to give it a try.  Not bad at all.  The broth was a little lighter (less flavorful) than traditional beef Pho, but that's to be expected if there's no beef.  The hoisin and sriracha served on the side helped a lot.  The soup was served with a nicely plated stack of cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, a few sprigs of cilantro, and lime wedge.  I was a little disappointed at the lack of cilantro and basil.  The soup did contain tofu and some very interesting fake beef, which wasn't bad.  Overall, I enjoyed my lunch.

Service was excellent even though the place was very busy for lunch.  The other dishes I saw being served looked very good.  I'd be willing to come back and try another dish (maybe the Kung Pao \"chicken\"?)  Decor is a mix of trendy/hipster, kind of like a Pita Jungle feel to it.  (Tip to management, you might want to iron the tablecloths.  This doesn't bother me but you are in the middle of one of the snobbiest parts of Scottsdale so just a suggestion.)

For Pho, I will stick to traditional Vietnamese restaurants.  I would definitely recommend this place to a Vegetarian/Vegan friend, though."}
{"text":"Another example of how awesome the Phoenix area is at doing vegan and gluten-free food. Nearly everything on the menu is vegan, and they have a separate gluten-free menu. I was thrilled that they offer a small size of their soups, including the Pho, which meant I could also order an appetizer (as typically the full size bowls of Pho are too much to get appetizers).

I got their Veggie Kabobs which were wonderfully flavorful with the seasonings on them, and the aforementioned small Five Spice Vegetable Soup (Pho), which was a tad on the bland side until I used a little of the hot sauce which made all the difference. It could have used some basil, which the menu said it came with, but mine came with parsley instead. Not quite the same. 

Will definitely have to come back and try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I've never had a meal here that wasn't absolutely delicious! They even have a gluten free menu! This place is my kind of place because it's fresh and there are a lot of different flavor options even though it's all vegetarian.  I especially love the Lemongrass tofu dish along with the Eggplant and tofu dish. If I'm REALLY hungry though, I go for the hotpot! They make their lemonade fresh every day and it goes well with pretty much anything in my opinion. 

My mom and I have become regulars whenever I'm up this way!"}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch specials.  Best Thai iced tea I've ever had.  Friendly to those who are gluten free.  I recommend the golden curry vegetables."}
{"text":"They take care and pride in dish preparation. I found Fresh Mint through happycow.net website and ate here two consecutive days. Each day I ordered a different soup and was very satisfied. The mock beef soup, similar to a traditional pho, was my favorite. While the customer service is a little lacking ... the emphasis on quality vegetarian/vegan food is evident and appreciated."}
{"text":"Was looking for a kosher option in Phoenix, we sampled quite a few items on the menu, everything we had was delicious, \"the ribs\" and Vietnamese coffee were my favorites, very happy to have found this place, service was quick and prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"First time here, I ordered the fresh mint salad and fresh it is.. excellent combination of vegetables and the dressing is really good! ! There's a great variety of hot and cold foods here, the soups sound delicious.. I will definitely be back for more freshness"}
{"text":"A friend and I discovered this place because we're always on the search for places that offer gluten free options. They have a large gluten free menu that I was very impressed with. We ordered the autumn roll, sweet and sour soup, lemongrass curry, and the coconut tapioca for desert. The food was GREAT! My favorite was the soup. 

We went on a Saturday night at around 6:30pm, the place wasn't full but had a good amount of people. When we walked in we weren't sat or greeted by anyone. Since this was our first time, we made our way to the cash register assuming that's where we ordered. Told the man it was our first time, ordered our food. He thought we were ordering to-go since we ordered at the register, we told him no, we were dining in and then he sat us. After that, the service was great. The food came out quickly and the server was nice and attentive. To be fair, there was only one person taking the orders and another running the food. 

Definitely will be coming back here because the food was just top notch. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went for some vegan food, the restaurant is entirely vegan except for the two dessert cakes. I asked why and was told they can't bake and haven't found a vegan supplier yet, so they have them as a courtesy to vegetarians. If you're not eating dessert, the entire menu was vegan. No animal products enter the kitchen. We had the kung pao chicken and soy beef and both were absolutely amazing, with the only criticism being that they were a bit salty. Otherwise it was nice to have such a huge selection of vegan food in a nice atmosphere with good service. We will be back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great Food!  Even non-vegans and vegetarians will like this food.  It is family owned and operated.  The wife is the cook, made fresh to your order (nothing is pre-made).  The husband is the host and daughters work there as well. Everyone is very friendly.

The food can be made very mild to very spicy.  And the choices of fresh vegetables is always included in this Oriental Style cooking.

They have a very good lunch menu that is $8 and is very filling.  Drinks extra.  

So for lunch or dinner make a point of going and enjoying the food and staff."}
{"text":"Reasonable priced. Delicious King Pao. Nice sauces!  Friendly owner.  We look forward to coming back! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I tried this place and the soy beef was delicious! It was my first experience with soy beef and I could not believe how good it tasted. I placed an order over the phone and it was ready when I got there. Would definitely recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Moving to AZ from San Fran, I was a little scared I wouldn't find many veggie restaurants....but my fears are gone!  Don't get me wrong- in the bay area I'd give it a 3 star, but not bad for the desert haha.

The service was kind of weird.

I started with the tofu spring rolls- Soooo good!

The Spicy Ginger beef was good, but I wasn't totally blown away

I'll be back again..."}
{"text":"I've seen some comments about service but ours was good. There were many people when we came in at about 12pm. This is the freshest and lightest food I've had here in Scottsdale. Really great place! Order the Thai tea, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Fresh, good quality food. Abundance of vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their autumn roll with ginger sauce and tasted my friend's dish with tamarind sauce.  Both tasty, healthy, light lunch fare."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find good vegetarian and vegan restaurants and I wish I would have discovered this place sooner.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  The environment, decor, tastes, and smells make me feel like I am back in the islands.  I am officially making this my new favorite place to eat in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great food. Owners are fantastic. I would eat hear all the time if I lived closer. Great place if your tring to eat healthy!"}
{"text":"They have the best lunch menu!! $8 for a tasty vegan lunch.. I've been here a couple times and the dish I usually get is the kung pao soy chicken...Sooooo Gooodd! I give this dish a 10!

The summer roles are perfect!

Dinner menu is a little pricy..."}
{"text":"I went to Fresh Mint tonight for dinner with meetup.com's Vegetarian Society of Phoenix.  It was my first time, and I will definitely be going back.

Our party was over 20 people and the owners were very gracious.  Everyone seemed to like what they ordered.  I heard the Sweet and Sour soup was good.  Other favorites were the Kung Pao Soy \"Chicken\", Curry Apple Tofu, Vegetarian Black Pepper \"Steak\", Lemongrass Tofu, and the Golden Curry Vegetables with Tofu.

I had the Golden Curry with brown rice, and it was wonderful.  The sweet potatoes in it were a treat.  I thought the portions were good sized.  I have leftovers for tomorrow.

I was too full for dessert, but when I go back I will try something.  I'm already planning my next trip to Scottsdale!

Do not accept American Express.  Not a big deal for me, just wanted to mention it."}
{"text":"First off, let's give some praise to the concept: A vegan, vietnamese-style, Kosher restaurant? That's the coolest thing I've heard since someone explained nonstick frying pans to me. Unfortunately, the service can be a bit slow, and a bit weird, but you've got to give them some credit for opening a place like this.

Most of the dishes are composed of rice/noodles, steamed veggies, and one of their vegan meats like chicken, beef, ribs, fish, etc., doused in sauce. It's awesome sauce (saucesome?) but it pretty much negates a lot of the healthier aspects of the dish. Why not wait to add those extra calories with some vegan carrot or chocolate cake instead? As far as recommendations, the lemongrass tofu rolls and green papaya salad are both light, filling and fresh tasting dishes. If you're a sauce-o-holic, opt for the tasty BBQ citrus spare ribs or soy fish in a clay pot.

....For those of you who don't want to read any of that, refer to the short & sweet version below:

Concept: hell yeah.
Service: weird.
Selection of \"meat\": awesome.
Vegan desserts: much appreciated.
Dishes: varied & satisfactory.
Sauces: too heavy.
Overall: 3.5 stars. I'll probably go back at some point."}
{"text":"Being a visitor of this area, we were looking for amazing vegetarian or vegan option restaurant for lunch. We found Fresh Mint.  (We hear the owner is from upcountry Maui. There are beautiful pictures on their walls from Kula!) Anyway, we were greeted with amazing, friendly staff with professional, quick service. We ordered the Autumn Summer Rolls, Lemongrass curry and a mushroom stir fry with vegetables.   It was all delicious. Definitely a must visit!"}
{"text":"The food. Was. AWESOME. 

I've been a vegetarian for a year, my boyfriend for over two years. After shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter H&M with my meat-eating best friend, we were absolutely famished. Because the food in that area is way too expensive for my pockets, my best friend recommended Fresh Mint to us. Because it was lunch time, we were able to get the lunch \"to go\" menu, which saved us a few bucks each. 

We all shared the Autumn roll, which was delicious but definitely not enough food for how much it cost.

My best friend got the Mongolian Soy Beef - it was fabulous! I absolutely hate most soy beefs and, while the taste wasn't perfect, the texture sure was! 

My boyfriend got the tofu curry - I am not a curry fan, so I didn't try it, but he loved it.

I got the kung pow soy chicken and dang, I was surprised. There was a perfect amount of food - not way too much; just enough. The consistency of the chicken was almost perfect (strings and all!), and the sauce was delicious. There were tons of veggies and the salad that came with it was awesome and light and fresh.

The owners are so sweet and friendly. I truly enjoyed eating there.

Oh, and one more thing - the BEST Arnold Palmer I've ever had! Fresh lemonade and fresh iced tea - deeelicious!"}
{"text":"Very Very Very Good!  Very Very expensive!  Very slow!
But I'd order again in a heart beat - so ridiculously delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and servers. Chef is married to owner who personally answered all my questions. Great tasting food & fresh. Fast service. Clean area. Only disappointed that they claim food is 90% vegan but they use regular sugar (which is processed with animals bones). Not like that at California authentic vegan places"}
{"text":"I started coming here prior to relocating to PHX.  They were calling themselves a 100% vegan establishment at the time, which disturbed me because they were selling non-vegan desserts and not informing customers of this. I consider that shady. They have since reclassified themselves as 100% vegetarian, so I'll base my review solely on their current status. 

First of all, the food is great (for the most part).  My fav dishes are some of the Chef specialties: Kung Pao \"Chicken,\" Black Pepper \"Steak,\" and Soy Fish in Clay Pot - the latter of which is my absolute favorite dish here.  Outstanding flavors and seasonings. Fresh, aromatic jasmine rice. Accompanied by bright and colorful veggies, which are lightly cooked and have almost no seasoning, but it makes you feel like you're eating something healthy, so I don't mind. (I usually eat the veggies first and then dig into the nittty-gritty.) 

Vegetable Fried Rice - Very good and flavorful. You have a choice of brown or jasmine rice; I opted for brown.  Cooked with assorted veggies (I omitted the brussels spouts), and veggie beef.  You can add veggie chicken for an extra $2-$4, depending on how much you want.  I got $2 worth of chicken added and it was a decent amount.  Very tasty dish, very filling and a huge portion; it lasted 2 days.


Roasted Potatoes - I got these on the side. They have a kick-@$$ flavor to them, but for $4 you get about 10 little smaller-than-a-tater-tot pieces of potato.  I swear, I looked in the bag, on the car floor, and on the table to see if 1/2 of my potatoes had sprouted legs or wings and flew the coup.  I was THISCLOSE to calling Agent Mulder to report an alien abduction of my taters! But nothing was missing. That was it.  They threw a few pieces of potato chunks into a big-ole box and sent me on my way. Ya know, maybe it wouldn't have been so shocking if they hadn't been put in such a large to-go container.  It only added insult to injury to open that big box and find mere morsels sitting there...laughing at me. This skeet ration needs to come in an appropriately sized munchkin-box, and it shouldn't cost more than $2.  Can you tell that I'm really salty about this skimpily portioned side order?? 


Imperial Rolls - appetizer.  These were once my favorite appetizer here. They used to be freshly made, fried to golden perfection, and served with a delicious dipping sauce. I can only assume that due to the negative reviews which focused on the wait time for the food, that maybe they changed some things so that some items wouldn't take so long to prepare. (FTR, I never complained about wait time. I appreciate that the good things are worth the wait.)  Well, these rolls now taste like frozen and re-heated rolls, although I've had better frozen spring rolls from the grocery store.  The quality has seriously deteriorated and the rolls were barely edible.  I hate wasting food, but I threw the rolls away after 2 de-appetizing bites.


Lastly, they lost an extra star due to poor service.  There was a kid working the register and taking the to-go orders.  I think he was the owner's kid.  He should not be dealing with customers.  TWA: Teenager with an Attitude + a condescending tone and 0 personality.  The way he said \"it's gonna cost extra\" when I asked to add the veggie chicken to the rice dish, was not in an informative way (which I'd appreciate), it was very rude and snobby. I was instantly livid!  I'll probably go back eventually, but I'm going to wait a while.  However, if I have to deal with that kid the next time, I will walk out.  I can only contain my inner Madea for so long.  

I lied..one more thing. They need more vegan dessert options.  Apparently, the only thing keeping them from being a 100% vegan establishment is the fact that they're still selling non-vegan desserts."}
{"text":"The first restaurant I visited for lunch at Phoenix and I was not disappointed. I walked with two of my co-workers and ordered the cucumber rolls, golden potato curry and coconut tapioca for dessert. Yummm!!! Left the place feeling so good!!"}
{"text":"Mint tomatoes was delicious.  Summer roles were ok. And the island salad was soaked in dressing and missing 2 of the few  ingredients (candied walnuts and dried cranberries).  Will probably go eventually for another try, but will definitely QC the order before leaving (if take out)."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim last night, not knowing that it was a Vegan/vegetarian restaurant.

That being said, I was VERY impressed! The food was very fresh and tasty. I was a little apprehensive about eating the meat substitutes but came away happy.

I had the cucumber rolls and the Lemongrass soy beef delight. I was very pleased with both. The cucumber rolls were handmade right in front of my eyes, and they were beautiful, crunchy, and FRESH. The peanut sauce that they come with was also very tasty.

The LSBD was also very good, I really liked the taste and texture of the \"beef\"; it even had the proper looks of shaved beef. The noodles that they are served with were light, perfectly cooked and a great compliment to the rest of the dish.

I'll for sure be visiting again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian yet love the food here, Everything I've had here has been incredibly fresh and so delicious."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of vegan food, but that was literally the best chicken I have ever had. It may be fake meat but it was super good along with the lemongrass beef. Picked this restaurant for my vegan friend and it's his new favorite restaurant. The place looked great as well. Any vegan out there must try this restaurant out."}
{"text":"Food was okay but pricey for what you get. Ordered the spicy ginger soy beef, which came with about 1 cup of entree, a side of dry plain rice, and about 5 pieces of half cooked veggies. The cost was $11. The service was also just okay, even when trying to make conversation with the staff they seemed very indifferent. For the same price, I'll be driving to the west side and go to Loving Hut, which has way bigger portions for the same cost."}
{"text":"Fresh Mint seems like a mom and pop takeout joint, serving up vegetarian Chinese/Vietnamese food. I had an eggplant stir fry lunch which was on the sweeter side and just okay, nothing particular great.  Coworker had a fried rice, which was also okay. Decent option if you're restricted to vegetarian food and don't want to worry about cross-contamination. They are also egg-free which is nice for vegans. Other than that, I don't think I'd make a trip out here for the food since it was just okay."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian (but not vegan) I was psyched to go eat at a place where I wouldn't be limited to appetizers and/or eating off someone else's plate (or having to face idiotic comments like \"just pick the meat off.\") The menu was like a smorgasboard of love! Tofu everything! Sweet Lucy, what did I do to deserve this? 

Fresh Mint, I so wanted to love you and hold you and call you my own. But I was denied.

I  had the Kung Pao Soy Chicken. It was pretty spicy for my taste, but that may just be because I am a wimp in that area. The decor was blindingly bright,  yet charming. But there were a few downs:  The service was slooooooww....especially for a lunch hour; the guy who served us had stains all over his shirt -- kind of like he'd just run a race or dripped beer on himself. I also saw him flip a tablecloth. Seriously. How gross is that?

I'll probably give it one more try, particularly since they now have $8 lunch specials. Oh, and they don't take American Express. Bummer.

Fresh Mint, I still have hope that someday -- you and I -- fireworks, long walks on the beach, champagne...don't let me down, baby!"}
{"text":"I write this as I use my chopsticks to pick up peanuts from the Kung Pao dish.  I just got lunch and Fresh Mint is really close to my work.  I'd read the reviews and thought it sounded like the best lunch EVER!
Eh, it's OK.  The Kung Pao is awesome and everyone's right - you don't even miss the chicken.  I'm not a veg-head, but I do enjoy a good tofu dish.  It came with a side of brown rice, huge plus.  Then, there's the salad.  The bagged-I-can-get-this-at-Safeway-salad.  It's drenched in dressing.  It is seriously nothing more than a bagged salad.
I also got the summer rolls.  Really fresh and yummy!  Light, too.  Came with a side of peanut dipping sauce that I would totally fill my bathtub with.
Fresh Mint, I like you.  I like the decor.  I like the Kung Pao.  I don't like the slow service nor the ghetto salad."}
{"text":"Anyone who would rate this less than 5 stars is on crack!

I have not had a meal here that wasn't absolutely delicious! The cucumber rolls are awesome, the hot pot, the eggplant...ugh, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The cucumber rolls come with a peanut sauce which is seriously the best peanut sauce I have ever had in my entire life. They also make this basil sauce that is light yet so flavorful; I could drink it! 

They have vietnamese coffee here and thai tea, which are awesome. 

The menu is 100% vegan (except for their chocolate cake and carrot cake) and they also offer a gluten free menu. Seriously, give this place a try....you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"I pass this shopping center every day on my way to work and read some great things on Yelp. One of my best friends is vegetarian so I thought it would be nice for us to try it out. We got there around 12:15 yesterday and grabbed the last remaining table. We were greeted promptly and had our order taken within about 5 minutes after being seated. I ordered the fried spring veggie rolls ($6) that were delicious. I kept snacking off the fried crispy pieces of the sides. 

For lunch, I had ordered the curry tofu and potatoes ($8). It came with carrots mixed in the curry sauce with rice and salad. I equally enjoyed the salad and curry sauce over the rice. I didn't care for the spongy tofu and would have liked more vegetables in the curry rather than just potatoes and carrots. This lunch was just okay. 

The service was horrible. I didn't get my lunch until 12:50 p.m. The owner was aware of it and apologized but apologies don't prevent me from getting back to work on time. When we were ready to pay, it took forever for him to pick up the check. My friend had to flag him down to get his attention. Very irritating. Timely service in a restaurant is important to me. I would have average food and phenomenal service, as opposed to, phenomal food and terrible service. 

Overall, the food was decent/mediocre at times with terrible service. It's doubtful I would go back."}
{"text":"Most important, all four of us loved the food when we visited last week, even the meat-eaters among us. We each got something different. It was all good. I wouldn't say the fake meat is \"just like meat\" as someone else did. It's super delicious though.

We liked the clean fresh atmosphere. The restaurant had a great look, although it's decorated like one of those inexpensive places without servers. It's not -- it's a normal sit-down and be-served place with appropriate prices.

The owner/dad served us and was quite enthusiastic. He likes to pop over with jokes and doesn't notice if one of you is in the middle of a story. If you don't mind the interruption I suppose it's endearing?

I definitely recommend and will be back for sure. 

P.S. Try the Mango Coconut Tapioca. Yum! There aren't a lot of vegan dessert choices around the valley and this is a good one."}
{"text":"Always good vegan food.  It's close to home and takeout is a good option.  Very nice people there and my picky 7yo loves the food!"}
{"text":"Wow, loved everything. The 'vegan' in our group brought us meat eaters to lunch here. Summer rolls, yum. We had the eggplant dish, the steak dish, and lemongrass tofu lunches. They came with a salad and a choice or white or brown rice. Each for just $8. So fresh, so tasty and no up charge for brown rice. No one missed the meat. We then shared the two dessert offerings, both vegan. Coconut cake and tapioca pudding. Both delish. Great service, neat and clean environment!"}
{"text":"I am honestly perplexed by the number of positive reviews on this place. Here is the thing, if you are vegetarian or vegan, you can go to practically any Thai restaurant and get something to eat and it would be ten times better than the crap served here. Honestly, the food isn't difficult to cook nor does it cost that much to make. So, the fact that you charge what you do and how much I get to eat (because the portions are tiny and I'm someone who doesn't eat much), it better be darn good. News flash, it is not good...no developed authentic flavor at all. I got the pad thai and my dad got the lo mein. It was funny because my dad's plate wasn't even half covered with noodles...like where was the rest of the dish? We counted three pieces of carrots, four pieces of broccoli, and a sprinkling of cabbage. I'm pretty sure the value of the food on plate amounted to 60 cents which makes the profit margins huge on an $8 lunch special. When my dad addressed the manager, the response was, \"That's how the portion is. We didn't forget anything in your dish\" Umm, wrong answer (regardless if it is true or not)!!! Bravo, you know how to be cheap. Bottom line, don't waste your time or your money here. I don't mind paying for food when I go out but I just ask that if I am paying, I actually get food in return...that's not what we got."}
{"text":"If you're into healthy, vegetarian & vegan food, this is most definitely your spot! The ingredients are always fresh, seasoned well, and cooked to perfection.

It could use a facelift & some better decor- especially if we're going by N. Scottsdale standards- but I can't find any fault with the food.

Faves: Summer rolls (the peanut sauce is TO DIE FOR), soy lemongrass beef, pad thai, and the imperial rolls are absolutely delish! Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"I have frequented Fresh Mint more than 20 times. My experience has always been great. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I have not been there for a while and today I went for lunch. I sat there for no less than 15 minutes and finally a dopey 20 something guy asked me if I wanted to place an order. I said yes and he plopped a menu down on my table. 10 minutes later and he never came back to take my order so I walked out.  I'm not sure if they changed ownership but this was awful and I will not go back again, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I'll admit... the thought of going to a vegan restaurant was a little scary for me. I'm no vegetarian, and a meal without a little meat just doesn't seem like a full meal. In fact going into Fresh Mint, we even made provisions to do a post-meal In-n-Out burger trip just to get our meat fix in for the night. As it turns out, we didn't need to make our 'meat run'... this vegan food is rockin! 

We got the kung pao soy chicken and a pad thai... both were very tasty. My soy chicken was so flavorful that if I wouldn't have known any better I'd have thought it was real chicken. The stand out here was the flavor... each dish seemed pretty perfectly seasoned; not too spicy but not too bland either. A lot of character and distinct tastes, which is always good. 

Service was pretty good, but nothing amazing. One funny thing that happened, and I don't know if this is a nightly thing or not... but they gave us a stuffed animal when we paid (weird lookin' thing). The guy that gave it to us actually said 'Guys get the check, girls get a doll'. Odd. 

Pretty solid place, although for the setting/decor it does seem a tad pricier than it should be. Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I have loved Fresh Mint since it opened and before I started eating Vegetarian only.  Each time was a delicious treat.  I was eager to take my family there yesterday.  I hadn't  been there in about a year.  I was surprised to see the place looking so tired and worn.  There was dust on top of the surfaces,  splatters on the window blinds, trash bins full in the bathroom.  We were also served dishes in bowls and on plates that were chipped.  Although the food was tasty, it caused all of us to question the food safety,  cleanliness and management, as well as if we would ever return.  It was a huge disappointment.  Please take note, I would like this to be constructive criticism.   I am always wanting to support local,  independently owned businesses."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to eat. The pad Thai was so yummy and filling. We also had green papaya salad which was unique and very tasty. We love this place !!!"}
{"text":"This place is really amazing.  I've been to a lot of vegetarian restaurants over the years and this is one of the best by far.  I just wish they were closer to Tempe where I live!  It's totally worth the drive though. We had the cucumber rolls (incredible!) and I had Pad Thai and my husband had the Kung Pao. Both were awesome.  Everything we got had amazing flavor and freshness. We had been going to Green and I have to say, this is better and worth the extra money. I didn't mind their prices because the food was really outstanding."}
{"text":"very good and lovely service.
we had the pho (not the best I've had but we certainly devoured it)
the kung pao chicken (very good!)
and the citrus spare ribs (also quite good)

I will say that if you're craving the spare ribs after hours i used to buy a substitute at whole foods that tastes just like it. same company also makes a pepperblack steak option that might be similar to the one on the menu here. But nothing to compare with the kung pao chicken!"}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this vegetarian restaurant during a recent visit after reading great reviews on yelp and I was not disappointed!
I had the ginger/citrus ribs and in a word, it was YUMMY."}
{"text":"An old college roommate and I are self-proclaimed foodies (and health nuts) and had a hard time deciding where to go for dinner while I was in town (it's awesome that Scottsdale has so many great options). We ended up being very happy at Fresh Mint. We started with the delicious Autumn Rolls and then ate the Rainbow Wonder vegetable dish and Apple Raisin Curry family style so we could enjoy both dishes. The food was so fresh, very flavorful, and beautifully presented. Definitely one of the best places I have eaten recently! Service was also good. Note that they close at 8pm. They didn't  rush us out, though. We were there until 8:20pm."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and I'd rate it 4 stars. Service, cleanliness, and ambience only 3 stars. 

There was a \"help wanted\" sign in the front and they definitely seemed in need of it. This was my first time coming to Fresh Mint so I was eager to hear about our server's favorite dishes. Unfortunately, he wasn't very patient or friendly. Not sure if he was the owner or what but he didn't seem to have enough time to devote to customers and he also seemed to be doing a bunch of jobs at once. People that were ordering takeout seemed frustrated about the wait time. I was also quite surprised they don't offer a kids menu given they are located next door to Modern Milk and across the street from Musicology, which are literally hubs for moms and their kids. I was hoping the server would at least take the time to give some kid friendly recommendations, but he didn't and instead I felt rushed. It was pretty clear they didn't have enough staff to handle everything effectively.

In terms of the ambience, the place wasn't super clean. There was dust behind the serving counter and the soda machine had 3 \"out of order\" signs out of 6 fountain drinks...not a good look. There was also a mildew crust around the entire fountain drink machine - yuck! The furniture and decor were pretty outdated too.

The food tasted great and I actually would return because it really was good. We ordered the fresh summer roll and fresh cucumber roll -- both were indeed fresh but the cucumber roll was better; the summer roll didn't have much flavor. Both came with peanut dipping sauce which was pretty good. For entrees we ordered their rainbow wonder which came with an abundance of vegetables and the sauce was quite flavorful. Not the biggest portions, especially since it wasn't on the lunch menu, cost $11.95, and I didn't have enough for left overs. My friend ordered the kung pao soy chicken which was very flavorful. It was on the lunch menu so it was offered at a reduced price (I believe around $8) but it also wasn't enough for left overs. 

All in all, the food was great and I'd return for it but hopefully they fix some of the cosmetic and service issues to make it a more pleasurable dining experience overall."}
{"text":"Lots of yummy vegan options, everything was beautiful when served. The fresh mint lemonade was delish! & huge! I had requested to add a veg to my plate & they were more than willing & it was just exactly everything I wanted. Restaurant was clean & bright. The only reason they are getting 5 stars is that the service was really slow. There was only 2 tables in the restaurant when we went. Us & one other. They were there probably right before us, so they ordered their app & then maybe 10 minutes later we ordered ours & it took like 15-20 minutes for them to come out. Then the food was like 20 more minutes after that. It's was just really long for some noodles & veggies. We also ordered brown rice but they forgot it. So we didn't want to wait any longer so they did take it off our bill no questions ask so that was nice. Great people, great food. We just aren't running out the door to get there any time soon you know?"}
{"text":"What an awesome experience! Great service and award winning meal. We had the Signature Lemongrass Curry with Japanese Eggplant. Awesome flavor and very fresh. Also had the Rainbow Wonder. A colorful mix of grilled fresh veggies.

This restaurant is the future of dining! Every meal is cooked to order. The effort that goes into the preparation of each dish is rewarding.  

The owners should be rewarded with expanding to multiple locations. We drove from Sun City West just to try this place . Well worth the drive but would love to see more locations some day. 

The only other similar restaurant we can compare this to is Thai Vegan in Albuquerque New Mexico.

This IS the future of dining so go check out this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"If I like a restaurant, I make it popular. I have the habit of dragging all my friends to the places I like.This my mission with Fresh mint. As I have no friends in Scottsdale, I need help from fellow yelpers This place is real good!!

 If you go to Fresh mint, make sure you try the fried rice in a clay pot...it stay hot for the whole time you eat it....tastes YUM!! Their fresh rolls are to die for... to top it all off, the service is just out of the world! Go there and I am sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I work in the airpark and have frankly been surprised to see Fresh Mint stay in business. When they first opened I tried them for lunch a few times and was underwhelmed, mainly with the slow service and somewhat high prices, and remember thinking they wouldn't succeed. Fast forward to today and I gave them another try and what a delight it was. The delightful basil eggplant was simply delicious, reasonably priced and served quickly with a smile. I'll be back."}
