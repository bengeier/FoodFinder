{"text":"Great place.  I always ordered the veal, which I love, but tried the steak the other day.  Amazing sandwich.  For $20 for 2 for lunch it's a great deal, and you won't need a big dinner it's so filling.  
Thanks Vinny"}
{"text":"Weird. Wanted to order 20 sandwiches for a work event based on yelp Reviews. Called starting at 600pm 4 times. Just voice mail even though voice mail said open until 7pm. Guess it's back to California's.  I suggest you pick up you phone. You'll make a lot of money and tips."}
{"text":"Omg this place is soooo good I go to home hardware across the street for my home and I can't leave with out grabbing a steak sandwich"}
{"text":"Had the veal sandwich and must say it is one of the best in the city. Will be back to try other sandwiches. Bravo Vinny"}
{"text":"Definitely a good sandwich, and one of the few places in the area for some quick eats.

To describe the decor as \"humble and utilitarian\" would be an understatement. But then people come to Vinny's for the sandwiches.

I think vinny's is about on par with California, maybe a little above. I think that they give you a few more peppers with your veal.

The other poster is right about the wait, and if it's busy you can wait 20 minutes for a sandwich. But if you're not in a big hurry, stop in and check them out."}
{"text":"Vinny exists! And, he's a really nice guy. They were out of breaded eggplant sandwiches on the day I visited, and since I don't eat meat, he made me a super veggie sandwich with extra mushrooms, peppers and onions (although, a little skimpy on the peppers). You kind of have to eat this open-face style, which takes away from the cruncy kaiser bun effect, but it's still very tasty and super filling. If Vinny tells you to grab a fork and knife, do it. Ask for extra sauce and get it spicy, it's not THAT hot and you have more than enough bun to rip off as a chaser if you're wimpy."}
{"text":"Vinny's makes one of the best veal sandwiches in Toronto. They're not only great but big enough to split into two, and eat over two meals. You can eat at Vinny's but it's a small place so best for take-out. I suggest you call15 to 20 minutes ahead so they have time to get your order prepared."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tasty, but at the same time I feel a little disgusted after eating it. I always order the veal sandwich and it's massive. I always have to share one half with another person. It's tasty, but it will make your stomach feel bloated for the rest of the day, which is probably not my favourite feeling espeically when you have things to get done that day. 

My friends and I always call in advance and then just go by to pick it up. Their service is relatively fast. For example, ordering 4 veal sandwiches and it's ready to be picked up within 20 minutes. Usually when we get there, they're always ready to give it to us. The workers there are extremely friendly and are always willing to start talk."}
{"text":"Great place!

Very popular with the locals and very busy for lunch, the 20-30 minute wait is well worth it!

Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Had the meatball today after they wrote about it in the National Post. It's the messiest sandwich I've ever attempted to eat. It's really good, too. Get it spicy (unless you're a sissy)."}
{"text":"I can't even think about Vinny's without getting hungry. it's one of those classic places that choose to focus on just one or two things and do them extremely well. Huge, delicious sandwiches -- veal or chicken. Spicy, flavourful, never dry, and to my taste, far better than California Sandwiches. Good idea to call in advance at lunchtime, as they do get busy and orders can take up to 20-30 minutes."}
{"text":"Love this place.

I always order either the veal or steak panini and it's PERFECT every time! The panini is HUGE (seriously, you could divide it into two separate meals). The veal is amazingly tender and incredibly thinly breaded and paired with juicy peppers. You can add other toppings like mushrooms and sweet onions for a small price. Also you can choose from sweet, medium or hot spicy. :) 

The only thing is that the bread is just a little too thick but that's my only small indifference. I have not been able to find anything comparable to this sandwich.

I work in the area so I call in and pick it up 10-20 minutes later so I don't have to wait at the restaurant since there's not a huge eating/waiting area."}
{"text":"Still the best-tasting panini deal in town. 
The sandwich price has risen from $6.95 to $8.95 - but yes, it is still my favourite in the city.

They use a kaiser-ish bun which is not traditional to the Italian panini canon, and more akin to the Chicago/Jersey style. 

My go-to is the Eggplant Panini with mushrooms. SO loves the Steak Panini with cheese. Each sandwich with the extra, comes to about $14 after tax and tip. Each sandwich is enough to feed a person for two meals. 

The buns are basic but do their job to hold the delicious marinara sauce in place. Eggplant is so well roasted, tender and seasoned perfectly. The steak, (thinly sliced skirt steak I think), is cooked just right - tender and flavourful. 

The owners are so friendly. Do yourself a favour and become a regular!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite place to get a veal sandwich in this city. The sandwich is huge, the sauce is delicious and the hot peppers really do bite. Call ahead for a smooth pick up and be prepared to wait during lunch hour!"}
{"text":"I have travelled the GTA to find the best italian paninis.  As luck would have it my favourite spot turned out to be the one I live closest to.  yay!  Vinny makes a great sandwich no doubt.  I have tried almost every sandwich on the menu minus the eggplant sandwich and this is my synopsis.  This is  my  list of sandwiches from best to good.
1. Steak Sandwich (the best - better than San Francesco's in my opinion as Vinny's has more meat in the sandwich).
2. Sausage on a bun (a close second - it took years for me to finally try this sandwich as I was hooked on the steak and thought it would taste like the hot dog vendor sausages).  I wish I tried this sandwich sooner.
3. every other sandwich

I got to admit they may not make the best veal sandwiches in the GTA.  In my opinion that honor goes to Rocco's Plum Tomato on the queensway followed by California's  (on the queensway as well).  Rocco's is more flavorful while California's is bigger.

Be prepared to wait 10 - 30 minutes for a sandwich as each and every sandwich is made from scratch!  I always call ahead to avoid the wait.  At under $8 for a sandwich it is a fair price as the sandwiches are big.  I can still eat about 1.5 sandwiches though.  I love ordering sandwiches with my wife as she can only eat half a sandwich so I get to eat the other half.

Try it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice folks, but we found it somewhat overpriced when you add in the toppings, and it's not exactly health food. Seemed kind of greasy, but some people might like that. Also, they prepare sandwiches fresh, so don't go there if you're in a big rush."}
{"text":"A sandwich shop that's supposedly better than California Sandwiches AND in my neighbourhood? To good to be true!

In fact, the sandwiches here are pretty amazing, I'm not sure I can say they're better than Calisan (our nickname for California Sandwiches) since I hadn't been there in the past year, but the sandwiches here are pretty amazing. Note: their medium is medium, unlike Calisan, where the medium is pretty hot.

We had the veal sandwich and it was great, good bread, not too too much sauce, a little salty, but that wasn't a big deal. Totally worth it, I will go here again for their meatball sandwich."}
{"text":"I really would give this place a 5 Star rating...their VEAL sandwich is the best ever/anywhere! Their steak is EXCELLENT, same goes for the Meat Ball! But I have to give it a 4 rating beacue the only complaint I can say is that they RUN OUT. More than many times when we call ahead, they are already out of Veal and it's still early. They also close very early so you have to really get there fast. But the Food is A1!"}
{"text":"Reasonable veal sandwich- not something I would eat everyday for 10 bucks, but definitely  not super overpriced. I don't think veal sandwiches are exceptionally flavorful or complicated at any other place in Toronto to begin with, so this is relatively good. That said, I could very easily replicate this sandwich for a few dollars at the grocery store, and there's no way I can justify spending this much on just a sandwich more often than once a week.
The staff is perfect: not nice but not unfriendly- they get on with their job and that's it. No unnecessary conversation unless you engage them, and that's how I like it.
This place really isn't worth it going out of your way for, but it's alright if you're already here."}
{"text":"You need a proper italian veal or chicken parm on a bun? Go to Vinny's. 

Worth the wait - made fresh to order. They always have espresso and Brio (and beer if you'd like too).  Choice of sweet or hot peppers, extra sauce, cheese. Oh no! Not I'm hungry! 

*This is not a place for a first date - it's messy to eat!"}
{"text":"The panini at this place doesn't disappoint. They are huge and can easily be shared by 2 people. I always go for the meatball with rapini. This place is a real treasure in the neighbourhood and Vinny is a really friendly guy!"}
{"text":"Boy this place is really your local place where friends come and have a great sandwich and perhaps a beer.

The veal sandwich is outstanding. Can't count the number of veal slices with hot and sweet (this would be the 'medium' heat) peppers on a kaiser. Smothered in tomato sauce, the kaiser barely holds the food in as it's dripping from all ends.

The grilled chicken, also same style but with non-breaded chicken breast. It's grilled with a good smoky flavor and again the kaiser can't hold the heaps of meat, peppers and sauce.

For $7.50 a sandwich it's a great lunch, and will fill you. I was already full after half, but i motored on cause it was worth it.

Only thing, you gotta find parking around it is in Toronto, some side streets do have free parking for an hr. If they got a few orders, does take a while. And, it's a bit cramped, but that's ok, once I finish i'm outta there.

Thanks Vinny!"}
{"text":"I live right by this little place so it's kind of hard to avoid as there aren't many good places to grab food in this section, apart from Universal Grill and the grocery store. It's a shame they tend to close at 5:00pm most days so you have to hit them up during work hours. (Note: They've extended the hours to 7:00pm on weekdays)

I see people drive up and park outside for pick up orders all the time. Local blue-collar workers head over to Vinny's for takeout constantly. And for good reason: their sandwiches are incredible. I would compare them to the infamous California Sandwiches, but I actually prefer Vinny's because they are a little less sloppy and have more flavour. The portions are big. I sometimes eat half the sandwich and think about saving the other half for later, but it's just too good to pass up on. Plus the staff are always super friendly.

Sitting in is an option but they only have maybe 3-4 tables so you might be better getting takeout instead. Most times I walk by the place is relatively busy, though I still think this might be a bit of an undiscovered gem to those outside the Dupont area. I think it's also family owned, which is always a good sign for me when it comes to quality and service."}
{"text":"The only place I've tried that's equal to or better than California sandwich nice place decent price friendly workers"}
{"text":"Some people say that they don't like veal.   

Something about how it's cruel to kill a cow while it's still a child.  

Something about how this is against the laws of nature.

Then they have one of the spectacular veal sandwiches here and they start making plans to kill other young animals to see how they'll taste in sandwich form.

A superb sandwich.  Freshly made to order.  Hand pressed.  Perfectly spiced and cooked.

Unlike other veal sandwich stores in the area, Vinny's does not overwhelm you with sauce on your sandwich... everything is painstakingly painted on with care.  It's a massive difference and one that successfully differentiates this sandwich from the others down the street.

You have to wait at least 5-10 minutes for your food, since everything is made to order.

If you're coming for lunch, prepare for lineups.   Well worth it."}
{"text":"Best Italian steak and meatball sandwiches in the city... 
that is all i have to say."}
{"text":"Between this & Amore, this should become Veal Alley. I don't get veal in California, or anywhere in the states really because we opted to play the extremism card in the face of pragmatism (read: Oh sure stuff chickens in shoe boxes but because everyone else inhumanely treated calfs means a few of course couldn't dare be humane toward calfs so it's gone away almost entirely). Here though... yet again it's pretty straight forward for Canada: Just be nice. 

At any rate, Vinny, my girlfriend is asking you to marry her in a review below. And if this were California where a child (the veal sandwich) can have three parents officially, I will say: Vinny, marry me. No questions asked. We can be a happy house with our little veal vittles & babies. 

I don't remember waiting 20 minutes. But according to sources I did. So I will assume you were pounding that schnitzel fresh. I can never get over how cheap great sandwiches are in Toronto. I can't get out of a shop for $10 in SF. 

I know there hasn't been many details here. Just know: don't make substitutions. Just order the veal. 

I don't eat veal often but when I do, I do it at Vinny's."}
{"text":"Easily the best lunch spot in the vicinity. I recommend going with the veal, and sweet marinara sauce. This place is only open for lunch, Mon-Sat. It's close to my home but not close to my work, so Saturday is my only chance to eat here which pains me to no end (probably good for me though). I would say it's a tie between this place and Nonna's (Bloor & Symington) for best Italian hot sandwich in town. Food takes 15 min, and you can call it in. Real local vibe. No frills interior but it's clean and they've got the news in tv and the Toronto Star to read. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best veal sammy in the city. The wait is torture but worth it. Calling ahead is a good call."}
{"text":"Pluses:  the bun is crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and barely soggy by the time I ate my sandwich at home; good value for the money, the sandwich can easily be shared between two people; filling, cheap comfort food that will definitely hit the spot on cold winter nights when I don't want to make supper

Minuses:  hot peppers overwhelmed the other flavours, I'll try leaving them out next time"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: In my books soggy bread is a cardinal sin! If I wasn't so anal on my bread being perfect this place would have easily gotten 4 or 5 stars because the sandwiches themselves are great.

I was excited to order a veal panini from this place based on all the great reveiews. If you're thinking ordering a sandwhich and you're in a hurry, call ahead because wait time can take up to 15 mins.

The location is small but has adequate seating and you can tell that they are probably the best eatery in the area based on the constant traffic in and out of this place.

My sandwich came and as mentioned earlier my bread was soaked in sauce resulting in soggy bread. The veal was perfectly breaded and the sauce was yummy (I got medium which was a little spicy with some kick)."}
{"text":"Really casual and small sammie shop. Generous portions with lots of meat. Enjoying a veal with onions and green peppers. The spice, if requested has a healthy kick!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and was amazed at how many stars this place got. Please start cooking so you really can judge a simple sandwich.No insult intended towards the public.

The owner reminded me of Mel from, Mel's Diner\". When you ask him a question he is very glib and a little rough. I saw him make three sandwiches and he forgot to season two of them and remembered the third one he made last.  

I had an eggplant sandwich and my friend order the veal. The eggplant sandwich did not come with bread to my surprise and he insisted that everyone loves it. Then again there was nothing on the menu that didn't love everything according to the owner.  The eggplant was breaded with a very thick batter. When I tasted it it was eggplant parmigiana with a pancake breading. In between was fried peppers and mushrooms with a tomato sauce.  Well the eggplant was terrible, bad breading and the vegetables were bland as well as the tomato sauce. DO NOT ORDER THAT.

My friend told that the veal was just okay since this sandwich was bland as well but at least he got a bun.

He loaded the tow orders with hot peppers that were not hot.

For the price and service go somewhere else. I am not a fan of California Sandwich but to me it is a better choice."}
{"text":"Smashing sammich shop in Christie Pits. I strolled in around lunchtime on a Friday to find the place packed with gritty locals eagerly awaiting their eats. The entire restaurant isn't bigger than the inside of a moving van, and you probably couldn't seat more than a dozen people without a fight breaking out. The decor is simply put: orange and blue. There is a picture of the Azurri on the wall and the obligatory TV blaring CP24.

Being a first-timer, I heeded Kent P's sage sangwich advice and scored the veal panini. Oh, man. The sauce, the crispy and moist breaded veal, the soft delicious bread, it all spelled perfection. Though I easily could have saved half for later, I stuffed that entire sombitch down, it was just that good. You veal a good panini, Vinny. Kudos.

Obligatory Title Pun: It's veally amazing OR: the Vinner takes it all!

Menu Readability: Written on chalkboards above the counter.

Need to mention: The sammies can take up to 20 minutes, but we were sufficiently warned.

What this place teaches me about myself: I will wait 20 minutes for a sandwich, provided it is forged by Gods on Earth."}
{"text":"Vincent, will you marry me?

I've had the veal, I've had the chicken, I've watched people attempt the meatball and I love every messy bit about this place. 

The door sticks and I always think it's locked and I'm too late for a taste sensation. Today the guy laughed at me and opened the door for me. Just sticky. I'll never learn. Their sandwiches are all perfect. Go for the medium spice as it has hot peppers on it, and is pretty firey. Sandwiches aren't where I like to test my heat skills, they're where I seek comfort. And these massive buddies are full of comfort. 

Your food might take a while to make (worth it) and in this time I like to dart over to Sobey's and pick up a few things. Today I grabbed toilet paper, POM juice and triscuits. Now you know.

PEPPER PROPOSES: Seriously! Vinny, wanna get hitched?"}
