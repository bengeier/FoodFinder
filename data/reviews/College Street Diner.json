{"text":"Food was okay, but service was way below average. Our order took 45 minutes, and the place wasn't crowded or anything. Not only once we were asked if we'd like a coffee or water refill. Even the bill took longer than you'd expect, and when it finally came, they didn't even gave it as a total sum -- we had to sum what we spent. They also never apologized themselves for the wait. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out Aunties and Uncle's around the corner for brunch, but the wait was 45 min and we were starving, so we opted for this place. Okay prices food breakfast food but the food was below average. Ordered what looked like the biggest thing on the menu, the College Supreme and it was nothing special. Service was also below average. Not once did someone ask if we needed a refill on our coffee, or needed anything else. Probably wont be coming back."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite diner in Toronto (and probably the rest of the world).  I come here four to six times a week for brunch.   I always get the same thing- a side of the waffles with banana and coffee. The waffle is the best I've ever had. Its not the typical diner waffle that comes tasteless and soggy. Its crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, comes with a dusting of powdered sugar and cinnamon, and it is so full of delicious flavour that there is no need for butter or syrup though if Im in the mood for it, there are individual packs of Jif peanut butter on the tables with the jam. I think they put cinnamon in the waffle batter as well. Its downright fantastic.   The banana is always ripe which is also a big plus and they have a great selection of other fruits as well (blackberries, pineapple, blueberries, strawberries).   The coffee is very intense and probably not everyones favourite but I love it. They have Twin Sugar for sweetener which is great because most places will only carry Sweet and Low and it tastes awful.   Ive tried a number of other things on the menu including their pancakes and french toast. They even carry a vegan french toast which I highly appreciate as I used to be vegan. My fiance is also a big fan of the greek omelete that can be made with egg whites.   College Street Diner has a cute diner feel and the waitstaff are attentive and friendly (especially the guy who works Monday through Fridays). I never have to wait for a table, even on the weekends when its busy.   Oh, and the prices are unparalleled. Coffee is included in any breakfast purchase and my waffle with banana comes to 5$. FIVE DOLLARS. No one beats that.   Overall amazing place. My number one diner."}
{"text":"This place is great for offering good food at a great price. It's not a foodie boon or a romantic setting, but it's reliable and tasty just like Maggie's (the former owners) was. Don't expect great ambience or creative menu options, but do get there before 10:30 a.m. and get the breakfast special. Hits the spot for a cheap weekday morning brunch."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Great special, $5.99 breakfast. Free Wi-Fi,  and exceptional service. Music ambience was right on the spot. Friendly service, meal was great and the Wi-Fi is strong. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by to fuel up before a long day of shopping. This place is small but the staff are friendly and helpful. I had the huevos ranchero and my wife had the Salmon benny. The huevos ranchero were not like any I have had before.  The eggs were placed in between two of the corn tortillas, and the only other stuffing was some delicious beans. The pico de Gallo was lacking in seasoning but was freshly made. Different but delicious! The salmon benny was really nice. The salmon came on top of potato pancakes instead of English muffins which was a tasty substitution. The hollandaise sauce is homemade and very good. Overall the food is very good and scratch made, which is really nice at this price point. Service is inconsistent, but I will be back, so it's not that bad."}
{"text":"Lovely music on the stereo. Great server who actually seemed to take pleasure in his work. Big ol' breakfast and good prices. Literally nothing not to like.  I came here because Kaplansky's was too busy and now I'll just be coming here in the first place. These guys deserve more business and you should give it to them."}
{"text":"Been here once before. About a year ago on Xmas day.. i think they changed owners. The place is much nicer, well maintained and clean.  I got the 5.99 special. Good deal and good food.  2 eggs hash brown and chicken sausage.   (You have many choices but this is what I got).  Oh and the fresh fruits are a bonus. Raspberry blueberry pinapple and orange slice.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star was the hash browns. .  They are the square ones I've had at Costco and I think they were way too greasy.. I'd come back"}
{"text":"we intended to try aunties and uncles but that was closed for a holiday weekend. so College street diner it is!  we had the 5.99 special which is sausage, eggs, toast, coffee, and garlic fries. not bad for 5.99, really liked the garlic fries.   cheap eats - not bad at all."}
{"text":"Yum! College Street Diner is a new welcome addition to the College/Bathurst area! I popped by here over the Family Day long weekend for a bite to eat and was pleasantly surprised!  It's a small, no frills diner with some table seating, and one nice big booth that you can snag in the back, if you're lucky (which we were ;))  Service was super friendly, from the time we walked through the door to the time that we left.  The food came fast and it was sooo delicious, and just what we were craving on a chilly winter day. Other than your standard diner breakfast fare, they have FOUR different types of stuffed French Toast and Crepes. As soon as I saw this I got giddy with excitement. They have:  Cream Cheese & Strawberry Jam (which it what we got - very tasty! We tried it with French Toast, but seems like it would be a nice crepe combo, too!) Peanut Butter & Banana Warm Cinnamon Apple & Nutella (also I THINK with bananas)  We also stuffed ourselves silly with their College St Special, a plate filled with Pancakes (that we subbed for more French toast), Ham, Bacon, Sausage, Toast, and your choice of garlicky fries or potatoes. A solid hangover dish, in my opinion!  Definitely worth checking out, and I most certainly will be back to scarf down different varieties of the stuffed French Toasts & Crepes."}
{"text":"Pretty good. We came downtown to try Aunties/Uncles but as we walked in the door we were yelled at by the staff. It was pretty cold but she demanded we go back outside. All I wanted to do was put my name down on the wait.  Anyway, after being turned off from aunties we saw College Street Diner. We were going to go to Sneaky Dees again but decided to try something new. I had Eggs Benny with the gypsy sauce. It was good, but I don't think should be called eggs benny. I liked the service. Even though it was busy, we were looked after. Also, the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is not. I guess you do get what you pay for. I got the $6.75 two eggs and bacon meal for breakfast. First bite of my eggs and I taste egg shells. Not a very pleasant surprise for an already hung over person.  Also when I ask for a water after my orange juice, I feel like they should at least wash out my cup before putting water in. I don't want orange pulpy water."}
