{"text":"The most horrible experience I've had in a restaurant. The management/owner was just simply unprepared and shouldn't be in the hospitality industry. We had a party of 7 so expected a few delays but not to this caliber. We had to ask for table settings, silver and glasses of water. When we were finally served water, it was in styrofoam because they ran out of water cups and they didn't have ice in those cups. Appetizers arrived but had no flatware to eat them with so they were eaten cold. We literally waited 2 hours after ordering but to no avail. We were trying to be patient and not ruin a Friday night with friends. When we finally spoke to a manager, she told us that our meal was going to be given priority but then 2 of our party weren't served. Because no one was attending us, we tried to get the manager again, then had to go back to the bar area to find someone in charge. The owner literally told me to \"go somewhere else if we didn't like it there.\" Well, that's what we'll do. I can take incompetence and chalk it up to new beginnings but I will not tolerate downright disrespectful and rude behavior, especially from the owner of the restaurant. There are a lot of choices in Charlotte and I urge you NOT to patronize a restaurant that treats its customers so badly,"}
{"text":"Been there twice. First time we arrived at dinner rush so kitchen was a little slow. The restaurant had also just opened. Second time got there early and food arrived very quickly. In both cases, the meals were very good. We tried different meals each time to get a good overall sampling. The service was also good both visits especially considering we like to stagger our order. Cody served us the most recent visit and was spot on as we finished each course."}
{"text":"I would say overall my experience was incredibly underwhelming. The noise was at first so loud it felt like we were in a club and I was worried I'd be able to even carry on a conversation with my friends but thankfully the music got less loud after a while. When I first sat down there was a short black hair on my menu. Ew. Talk about unappetizing. The service was great though and our waitress was very friendly and not overbearing. We did not have to wait log at all for our food. I got the five spice bahn mi and it was good and the price was decent but it did not come with a side which I found unusual. It's not something I'm dying to order again or craving by any means. The ambiance was cool and I certainly felt very trendy. Will not plan to return though. I'm sure there are more satisfying places out there."}
{"text":"I'm glad I gave this place another try after my first experience (first time was near opening of restaurant and service was terrible!).  This time, service was great and food was even better.  Shared pork dumplings, pork belly buns, edamame spring rolls, and short rib banh mi.  All were delicious! I would recommend all of those items except the spring rolls -- they were a little bland.  Not bad, just not memorable. Side note: they don't take reservations so that's annoying."}
{"text":"The dumplings are amazing!! If you go for lunch, ask for Nikki she is the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great ambiance and amazing flavors food. Curry Laska is a must"}
{"text":"This would be five stars easily if not for the inappropriate, loud music.  Co has such a serenely beautiful Asian vibe and then it's spoiled by the loud, rock music.  WHAT?  It's a beautiful place in every way except for that.  The menu is great and our service was impeccable. (thank you, Angelo!)  I am allergic to onions and scallions and there was no problem leaving them out of my Pad Thai, which was absolutely delicious.  Don't miss the cheesecake wontons. They sound weird but are awesome!!!  Also have an interesting cocktail menu and my Orange Blossom(?) was super."}
{"text":"Visited during restaurant week. This is my 4th visit and each time has been a little better. Love the bar and the fact you can stop in and get a table without reservations. Favorite part of the meal was the papaya salad I think they have perfected the dish. The only downside is the desert menu , this could bring them that last star"}
{"text":"Crowded lunchtime Saturday, service was very good but a little slow.  Friendly waitress who was helpful with the menu offerings.   Pan Asian menu items mostly from SE Asia.   Food was ok, and customizations were available.  Had chicken banh mi sandwich (Vietnam fried chicken tender sandwich).  It was good, the cabbage slaw side could have been tastier.  Overall this new restaurant is just starting reach its stride.  The Charleston restaurant is definitely mush better."}
{"text":"We went in tonight around 7:30, the hostess seated us right away. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes while multiple waitresses walked by our table, but no one ever came over to wait on us. After almost 10 min of waiting, we finally got up and left. It's a shame, because we have been looking forward to trying this place out.  I don't think we'll be back...."}
{"text":"This place is your typical we-are-new-and-hip-and-therefore-don't-care-about-service-or-food type restaurants. Waited for about 20 minutes at the bar to get a drink. Bartender was smug and didn't seem to care about serving the many people trying to get a drink at he bar. Finally, after getting a drink for myself and the three others in our party, a bus boy ran into me, causing me to spill my drink on myself and the floor. He was barely apologetic, and ran to the kitchen to get a mop for the floor, but didn't offer me a napkin or anything.  Like so many other new, hip, restaurants that try too hard, this place has no staying power.  I give this place 6 months..."}
{"text":"We tried CO for the first time tonight. Don't be afraid to share the plates. The beef dumplings were great. We will definitely be back. Great place!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It has a couple of different options depending what you are in the mood for:  sushi, bang mi, traditional rice dishes.  I love them all.  There is a good cocktail list and the decor is cool."}
{"text":"I think this place has potential to be excellent and I want to love it, but last night there were some issues. It took almost an hour for our sushi rolls to come out. Then another 40 minutes or so to get our main dishes. My dish came out 10 minutes after the 3 others at my table got theirs. The waitress did apologize a couple times for the slow wait times, but they really need to get it together.   The good: Sushi was amazing. We had the pork belly and the spicy tuna crunch. I also had the drunken thai noodles which were very good. Atmosphere in this place is amazing.   The bad: inexcusably long wait times for food. Also, my friend got the pad thai and it was extremely spicy, which is odd because traditionally it's not supposed to be spicy. It was hotter than my drunken thai noodles, which the waitress warned was very spicy when I ordered.  I'll give this place another try. They're brand new, so I'm hoping they'll work out the kinks in their service. Food for the most part was great."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch, so it was not too busy.  Our server, Nikki, was great.  She was very friendly and attentive.  I had a curry, my companion the pad thai.  We were both happy with our meals and will be back.  The meal took a little while to come out, but it was steaming hot."}
{"text":"Beef Pho was just OK. Was given a tiny, shriveled piece of basil, a small amount of bean sprouts. Quality of beef was good though. The broth did not compare to the more rich, complex flavor you would find at several other less trendy (and more reasonable) places in Charlotte.   The atmosphere is hip, but is more of a bar that happens to serve a variety of Asian dishes."}
{"text":"We love this place. Best kept secret in South Charlotte !!! If you go, you have to ask for Chelsea, she is awesome. She has been our waitress twice now and she is amazing ! Great place, great atmosphere, great food, and the service is terrific !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Asian cuisine for reasonable prices. We had the beef and kimchi dumplings which are a must. My wife had the Hanoi noodles with shrimp which were very tasty. I had the spicy udon noodles with chicken which is probably the best Asian dish I've ever had. I went back a few days later for more. All of this was reasonably priced ($5 for dumplings, $12-$14 for noodles). Well worth it! Only complaint is the very small selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"I would love to review this place but I can never get hold of them! I've tried three separate days over the last two months and nothing. Their phone has been \"broke\" FOREVER. It is so annoying. Some days their phone will ring and ring, the next day it tells me the Time Warner Cable voice box is full and the next I get a fax machine sound.   Today I call to see if they are open and like magic, someone answers and she is not nice. Whatev. I'm still excited someone picked up. She says their open until 11 and I say I'll call right back with a take out order. 10 minutes later \"the Time Warner Cable phone you called is unavailable.\"  What the hell! I give up!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal last night! Our server was terrific, and was very knowledgeable about the menu. We had our kids with us so it was nice to know there was a dedicated kids menu. There were so many appealing dishes on the menu that we wanted to order. We will have to go back to try others. Definitely nice enough for a date night or great for a family dinner."}
{"text":"First visit and we are already planning our return! Hostess was welcoming and polite. Our waitress Mitzi knew the menu well, helped us with selections and also handled our peanut allergy expertly without making a fuss. Sushi is outstanding, best we have ever had by far in Charlotte, noodle bowl was delicious and the meat was so tender. For those with peanut allergy: when food was delivered my daughter was quietly told the chef had made it carefully for her. Fantastic menu, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal! My favorite new Asian place- and I grew up in Singapore. Try the Edamame gyoza for a nice twist on  an old favorite. The curry laksa was delicious and so was the tuna tataki! Soo was so friendly and helpful- five stars. Lexi, our server was right on point"}
{"text":"Do not pass CO, do not collect 100.00... stop there and spend it!!  We had our third visit to CO on Friday. I got the Curry Laksa for the 2nd time and my husband liked mine so much last time that he got it too. Garrett was our server and was as appreciated as Mitzi and Sue were on our previous visits. I did not do a review after our 2nd visit, so I will say the Ahi Poke is also fabulous! I have been happy with every single thing I have ordered in our 3 visits and the only thing my husband wasn't crazy about was the Banh Mi. He felt it was too bready. This is definitely our favorite Asian restaurant outside of Asia!!"}
{"text":"Not a good first experience here.... Started out ok, then found a huge piece of cooking twine in my noodles. I have to commend the staff, both front and back of the house, as they were quick to fix the problem. The manger apologized and comped most of the food that was ordered. They offered to make another Curry Laksa. I declined."}
{"text":"Banh Mi and Vietnamese is the latest food now making its way onto the main stage.  Stopped by for lunch and tried the pork belly bun, caramel pork banh mi and green curry tofu.  The pork belly lacked flavor and I couldn't tell it was pork belly, the bun was deep fried and came out very greasy.  The Banh Mi was good but lacked the explosion of flavors that you would associate with a Banh Mi, strongly marrinated carrots and daikon along with cilantro and jalapenos. The bread was not the usual crunchy baguette you would expect on a Banh Mi sandwich. For half the price I'd go to Le's Sandwich Shop for a great Banh Mi or The Yummi Banh Mi food truck. The green curry with tofu was very good not enough veggies and tofu.  Menu is part Vietnamese, Thai and Japanese.  If you are looking for excellent Vietnamese then you might be better off driving down South Blvd. to Vietnam Grille or Le's for Banh Mi."}
{"text":"I had their Thai Coconut curry with shrimp and it was amazing. The perfect amount of spiciness. I loved the assortment of veggies and seafood.  I really will keep coming back to this place to satisfy my Thai cravings. The interior is pretty modern and hip. the customer service is excellent!  I love that this place has good parking and is  close to other places that I need to usually visit- post office, super market, rite aid, etc."}
{"text":"As an Asian,I have to say, the food here all taste too sweet. It's like they even forgot to put salt, they choose sugar instead."}
{"text":"I placed an order from here for my first time using UberEATS. I ordered the Curry Laska, Pork Belly Buns, Cheesecake Wontons, and Strawberry Rolls. Delivery was prompt and packaging was good so nothing spilled during transit.   I am not one to complain about prices if the food is good. I saw photos of the establishment and they did an impeccable job with their interior so I can understand the high prices to match but food should be decent, at the least. I was hungry and extremely excited to try their Curry Laska... however disappointed that it was so salty that I couldn't eat it. Total waste of $15 for this dish. The pork belly buns were delicious at this point and the deserts were fun as I love sweets and trying interesting concepts. I may try other things on the menu but next time, I will opt to dine in."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Very helpful staff.  Bartender and drink selection were all 5s.  Craft beer selection should be much better.  Staff was nice knowledgeable.  However, not prompt with follow ups.  Great for date night.  Beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been 3 times and it gets better and better. I'm an avid sushi eater and this ranks up there!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight! The food was way better than the service. Our waiter only check on us once, never got us water or asked if we wanted a second round of drinks. The girl who delivered the food couldn't recommend a pairing because it was only her second day and then never brought a peanut sauce we asked for.  I had the short rib bon mhi. It was tasty. My husband had the ramen. He thought the broth was good but the ratio of noodles to broth was way off. Too many noodles.  We will go back once they have worked out the kinks."}
{"text":"I heard of this place from my colleague, and I happened to be in that area today, so I decided to give it a try.  We ordered pad thai and steak udon.  it turned out to be a big disappointment.  The pad thai was so sticky, wet and sour. I would say it was the worst pad thai that I have ever had in my whole life.  The steak udon tasted better than the pad thai but was not impressive either.  Overall, I think this place is over rated.  the taste and presentation of their food is fast food restaurant level.  that was my first time and will be the last time visit the place."}
{"text":"Everything here was excellent! My wife and I stopped in to celebrate our anniversary and were not disappointed. My wife had the cucumber mojito which was very refreshing. We shared the green papaya salad and fresh summer roll. I would highly recommend both. I had the firecracker and rainbow roll and my wife had curry laksa which were both great as well. Our server Soo was very attentive even though she was also tending the bar. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Treated with a great smile by the hostess and went up hill from there.  Food presented beautifully and was absolutely delightful.  Sushi delicious, as well as the appetizers.  Definitely a return for me and my guests."}
{"text":"The food here never fails to hit the spot, the Pad Thai is sublime, the pork belly sliders are fantastic and the staff are excellent. My wife and I agree this as our favourite restaurant and we keep coming back. With my wife being 9 months pregnant we were well looked after by our server Ashley who helped with specific meal requests and was very accommodating.  We'll definitely be back, once our baby arrives. It's good to know they do take-out."}
{"text":"I keep coming here, wanting to like this place.  It's close to my house and I like Asian food.  I've now had several of the noodle dishes: go to Futo Buta if you want noodles.  I've had several of the small plates: the pork belly bun was grease on grease.  An already fatty piece of meat shouldn't get a \"bun\" that's deep fried.  Not enjoyable.  The big tree thing in the middle is cool but if you want great Asian food, don't come here. Decent at best."}
{"text":"While the space isn't small, the seating is limited, so be prepared to wait up to an hour. Our apps were the highlight of the night as it was downhill from there. Table service leaves a lot to be desired. In fact, I questioned after our food came whether it became self service.   The floor was very slick throughout. I was able to speed skate to the bathroom from our table with a form that Apollo Ono would admire. A couple of female patrons wearing footwear less suited to skating were seen holding the wall walking to the restroom from their table. Wear your nikes.   Seats have no back support and are generally uncomfortable.   Food lacks flavor and portions were kind of on the small side.   Plenty of other places in Charlotte better than this to get those curry and lemongrass flavors."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and I'm a little disappointed with the service. We arrived and were given a 45 minute wait time for a party of two. We waited at the bar where we got two drinks and the service was timely. I got the sangria, which is one of their cocktails, and it was good. After about 10 minutes, our table was ready. Our server greeted us within a decent amount of time but after that we didn't see much of him - he would disappear to the back. We ordered the shanghai chicken wontons and pork belly buns for an app. They were delivered quickly and both were really good. Our entrees, pad Thai and com chien, were also very good but were delivered shortly after we got our appetizers. I had to go to the hostess stand to get an extra set of chopsticks since our server took mine and he didn't come back around for a quite a while. From a food perspective, this place is pretty spot on. The service, however, needs work."}
{"text":"I don't normally leave reviews, but I was blown away by the service and saw all the poor reviews about service so I thought I would share my experience.  I'm currently dairy/soy free because I'm breastfeeding and my little one is allergic.  I ordered sushi and asked them to make it dairy/soy free.  I was expecting the normal \"sure\", but who knows and servers/restaurants typically don't care or they just avoid things like soy sauce and don't check the actual ingredients.  Not here!! The server spoke to the chef and he came out and went through all the ingredients that had it and told me what he was going to do instead to make sure I liked it.  Wow! I was blown away that they took it seriously and took the time to come out and explain it to me (and it was busy).  Then..  I'm that girl.. I hit my glass and it shattered everywhere.  They were great cleaned it up quickly with a smile and asked if I wanted another one.  Good service/good food!"}
{"text":"Taheerah gave the best service and she makes me want to come back and experience more. Thank you so much for the great service!!!!! Love all the food here! And she was amazing with our wine and sake selections!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Fresh ingredients!!!! Price point for South Park is amazing!!! Way better then Futo buta!!! Futo buta is way over priced and there stocks are way to heavy and oily, if you know what ramen and Asians soup bowls are suppose to be!!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOR: Great tasting pork gyoza appetizer and great cocktails.  I would save this place for that.  AVOID: crab & pork spring roll !!  You have been warned!  We had to send crab & pork spring roll back because it smelled and tasted terrible.  SUSHI ROLLS: we tried a couple and I would go elsewhere.  But I have heard that the pad thai here is awesome, so I would like to go back to try that!"}
{"text":"Upscale ambiance, good for groups and drinks. I would recommend it as a group meet-up place for drinks or a date for drinks. It's new so likely a hot spot for a while but the food is lacking and the prices are inflated. I've been here twice, both times with my brother (2 different brothers) because they wanted to check it out. I had drunken noodles and pad thai. Both had too much salt. They said their dishes were okay at best. High price is okay for good food and presentation. For example, Good Food on Montford, is pricey but delivers on taste. All 3 of us liked the decor and attentive wait staff but won't be returning any time soon. It's a shame the food quality/taste doesn't match with the ambiance. It wouldn't surprise me if this place closes down within 3 years once the shine wears off."}
{"text":"I was really anxious to try this place!  I love the concept: reasonably priced menu, great atmosphere, convenient neighborhood.  I want this place to succeed but first impressions are a little shaky.  Food: 2.5 stars We ordered five items.  Two of them were \"OK\": Korean Short Rib Banh Mi and Water Chestnut Dumplings.  The other 3 were poor...definitely would not order again.  The Edamame Spring Rolls were tasteless and greasy.  The Avocado Ceviche and Tofu Buns were not memorable.  Very hard to find decent Asian in Charlotte.  On a positive note the prices are reasonable.   Service: 3 stars Shaky and unsure.  Also still wondering why they brought all 5 dishes for the table at one time (when some were small plates/appetizers.   Atmosphere: 5 stars Decor is amazing.  Very unique and modern.    They have only been open a little over a week so I will definitely try again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been waiting to try this spot since it opened, yesterday we finally got around to it & we were very impressed. The restaurant is very modern and clean & the staff is friendly and knowledgable about their menu. We ordered pork and ginger dumplings, mango spring rolls and the Korean short rib banh mi sandwich. All amazing. The food is really delicious and the pairings of sauces to go w/ the meals compliment the dishes nicely. I also thought the price point was reasonable. Almost forgot, the elderflower Spritz cocktail I enjoyed, definitely a refreshing cocktail! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst food and service I've had in years! I tried my entree and the other 5 at the table and nothing was very good. The steamed pork dumplings small plate was the only good thing we ate. Waitress was lacked attentiveness and everything was slow and only warm temperature wise. Half the food came out then 5-10 minutes later the other half came out.  I'd give no stars if I could."}
{"text":"Love CO in Charleston and I'm glad Charlotte is home to their newest location. This is a great restaurant with a beautiful design that impresses all of your senses. On my last trip, I ordered the pork & ginger gyoza dumplings, pork belly buns, and the bún bò hue. The dumplings are delicious with a side of soy scallion sauce and the pork belly buns are 50/50 for me given the steamed pork bun at Good Food close by are the best in Charlotte. The main course was my bún bò hue which had sliced brisket, lemongrass-braised pork, bun rice noodles, purple cabbage, mint, served in a spicy chili broth... and it was on point!  I can easily recommend CO :)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Got the pork gyoza, Hanoi noodles, and a sushi roll. Delicious. Good friendly service."}
{"text":"Had high hopes, but was disappointed.    I know it's a new place and I should've not gone so soon.  I got the pho ga.  My wife and daughter each got the beef pho.   All three of us were disappointed.  Flavor was fine.   Too little meat and too few noodles.   And hardly any garnishments (and wilted greens)  ... Bean sprouts, etc...   Pho is much better at every other place locally.   Also got the beef dumpling and the dumpling dough was too soft and falling apart.   Great location and cool decor inside, so I hope they figure it out."}
{"text":"We decided to give CO a try for an early Valentines Day dinner this past Saturday.   When we arrived, there was about an hour wait. So we put our name down and head over to the bar for a drink. The ceiling above the bar is absolutely cool! I love the wood ceiling as a focal point and having the bar in the center. My husband and I both grabbed a glass of wine. The wine list was pretty small but I thought the prices were just right.   After a bit, we started chatting with the hostess (who I believe was the GM). I recognize that his business is sales. However, he thoroughly walked us through his favorites on the menu and was the person that made us want to stay (as we were considering leaving, since the wait was long) to check out the food. Just an awesome person to talk to!   We eventually got seated and I ordered the bourbon blackberry drink. Oh my gosh....this thing was delish!!! Muddled blackberries mixed in so well, flavor wise!   We started with the pork and kimchi dumplings. They were very tasty. A bit spicier then I was expecting but delish! Additionally, we got the pork belly buns, pressed spicy tuna roll, and green chicken curry. The pork belly buns were good. However, I was expecting them to be steamed and they were fried....Im sure I just missed that on the menu. I thought the flavor was really well done. The pressed spicy tuna roll was just a log of deliciousness. I want to try more of their sushi in the future. The green chicken curry stole the show for me. It was a very very nice portion and just crazy flavorful. I may or may not have actually drank some of that sauce from the bowl :)  Overall, I thought the service was fantastic and food very delish! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but I have to agree with all the comments about the service.  The waiters don't know how to serve, they are inexperienced and clueless. We asked about the  $3 margarita special that was advertised and he didn't know about the specials.  We showed up at 530 and weren't informed about the happy hour  prices.    Food however was awesome.  Pork belly buns, tuna tacos, firecracker roll and edamame were excellent.  Wish we had tried the Coconut curry"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try out this new Charlotte restaurant ever since it opened (which wasn't too long ago)! My husband and I went for a late lunch and absolutely loved it. The ambiance was exquisite, the staff was friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the huge portraits on the wall and the modern vibe the restaurant exuded.  Ordered cocktails to start, specifically the Jalapeño Guava Margarita and the Sparkling Pineapple Sake. Both were to die for. Amazing flavor.  We love gyoza, so had to try their Pork & Ginger Gyoza as an appetizer. Juicy, fresh, and delicious. Highly recommend as a starter dish. Not too filling, but flavorful and worth it. We also had the Spicy Tuna Pressed Sushi. Extremely fresh and lovely presentation.  For our main dishes, we both went for a broth noodle bowl: the Viatnamese Ramen & the Curry Laska. Our server recommended the Curry Laska as the best thing on the menu. Though we hadn't tried everything on the menu, it was definitely the best place to start. Each broth bowl is humongous, so I wouldn't recommend getting too many starters or sushi rolls beforehand. Neither of us could finish ours main dishes. But the flavor was incredible and warmed us up on the chilly day!  Immediately made the decision after we left that we'd be back. Can't wait to try something new next time around!"}
{"text":"Been here about 10 times and it has yet to disappoint! The food is delicious, the staff attentive but not \"over the top\" and the atmosphere is \"chill\" (great music). I recommend it! I'm not sure why some people ding CO with lower than 5 stars as it has never been anything less than 5 for me. I had the Korean Rice Bowl and it was almost too pretty to eat! (see pic). Alas, I decided to eat it! Yum!"}
{"text":"Really fits nicely in the \"New Park Road Shopping Center\". The entrance is nice and the interior is well above average - maybe even stunning! My wife and I had a fairly long wait and must admit, the hostess and wait staff were extremely friendly and made our wait seem much shorter that it was. I wish I could say the same for the food. Our opinion: \"Average at best!\""}
{"text":"Get there early or you'll have a hefty wait. We tried for weeks and it was about an hour and a half wait every time. Tonight we got lucky with 30. Otherwise the food was flavorful and well priced. I had the ahi poke ceviche and drunken Thai noodle. My husband hat the kimchi dumplings and udon noodle. Everything was delicious and I Felt it was reasonably priced. They're new and working out service kinks but we Will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Nice place good food , they don't have much variety but it's good for one time. I ordered the chicken lashes it was yummy but expensive. Dinner for 2 was easy $70 but it was a good experience"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the two times I have been here. Food is very good and it has a really cool modern interior. Service was ok, nothing to write home about but very adequate. Will definitely continue coming here for good asian food."}
{"text":"If you want a completely disconnected experience with subpar food then this is your place.   You don't get greeted when coming in or leaving. The wait staff wasn't bad this visit (I have given this place 2 tries).   They have some good gyoza, but the pho and the summer rolls leave nothing good to say. In fact the summer roll had uncooked noodles that stab you in the mouth and could crack a tooth and the management only takes half off if you have eaten part of something.   Nope waste of time and money."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to CO, which advertises a \"uniquely inspired menu that includes modern interpretations of Asian dishes.\" According to their website, CO means \"feast\" in Vietnamese.  Dora here. You can't tell by this photo that it was only about 15 degrees outside, right? Yowza! When we left our house, we trekked through at least six inches of snow on our driveway. So when Ernie rattled off three choices for lunch, I was all over CO. Know why? Soup. Pork dumplings. And because our son has been traipsing all over Vietnam for the last couple of weeks, and his photos are stunning! So, hands down, we were headed to CO, and it didn't disappoint. Such an intriguing interior with so many different elements, including this centerpiece that fans out from the bar. Reminded me of a tree. They offer plenty of seating options, including an outdoor area. And, no, we didn't go outside to check it out. Brrr. Our food came out quick and our server was helpful and knowledgeable. Actually, we talked to a few staff members and all of them were gracious and friendly.   I chose the Malaysian Chili Wings appetizer, marinated in coconut milk and tossed in pineapple, ginger, lemon grass and chili sauce. These crispy wings were outstanding, both spicy and sweet, with a fruity favor that kept me coming back for more.  The Korean Short Rib Banh Mi was packed with tender braised short ribs, kimchi (a spicy pickled cabbage) and aioli. The sturdy bread held up to the generous portion of meat. The combination of spices paired well with the smoky meat, one of those dishes where the heat doesn't really kick in until afterward. This was my first time eating Vietnamese food but it will not be my last.  Dora here. When pork ginger gyoza (dumplings) are on the menu, I am not about to pass them up. Soft as pillows and so flavorful, I could eat these every day! Had we known the Pho Ga, shredded chicken and bunches of noodles in a hearty beef broth, bowl would be so huge, we could've shared. But, I don't think I could've swayed Ernie from his sandwich. lol. This is one of those soups where your spoon never comes away empty-handed. Quite a few flavors swimming around in here to tickle your tastebuds. Yum! Perfect for a frigid winter day and I even brought some home. Win, win. This is definitely a place we'd love to come back to or pop in if we're in the area. Especially during the winter.   What about you? What's your favorite go-to food in the winter? What's your favorite soup? Stop by Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog http://bit.ly/2kKSRGz and share. We'd love to know! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and the decor is something you have a hard time looking away from. It's fabulous.   We went on a Friday evening around 7pm and got right in without waiting. Great! The beauty of this place is all in the center of the restaurant where everyone is sitting at high tables. There is a half wall around this area, and then there are 9 low tables set outside of the wall. If you are one of the 9 unfortunate souls who gets sat at a low table, which we did, you are instantly transported back to your 10 year old self expecting an adult table but banished to eat at low kids table outside of the action. You get an excellent view of the wall, and just the tips of some peoples heads. The \"kids\" tables are very close to each other, so you get waitress butt in your face. My husband didn't mind.  The outdoor seating area is basic.   The staff was nice.  We received an offer in the mail to try their restaurant buy one get one meal free. When we got there, we asked the waitress which meals this offer applied to. The catch: we were only able to choose from 3 rice dishes to get the deal, all of which we did not especially want. We're adventurous though, and tried them out: the Com Chien and the Korean Rice Bowl. They were okay but we wouldn't order them again. The rice bowl was extremely spicy (and I like spicy). My meal came out about 10 minutes before my husbands. I ended up sharing mine and we ate my entire meal before his came out. None of the staff mentioned anything, no apologies from staff. No updates about his food while we waited. Our waitress was nowhere to be found. Maybe that's how they do things.   In my opinion, if you're a new restaurant (I know they're a chain) trying to get the nearly neighborhood locals to try and dig your restaurant, don't force them into ordering something they may not like with a tricky stingy coupon."}
{"text":"My favorite part about my dining experience here was my fascination with the architecture of the restaurant.   Other than that, everything else is bad.   Service wise, the host wasn't welcoming at all. We only saw our server twice, once to take down our order and the last time was for our check. The person that brought out our food didn't seem like he was well trained as he spilled our entrees on the table.  Here is the nitty gritty on the food. My friend and I ordered: Thai Chili Chicken Wings Kimchi dumpling Bun Bo Hue Curry Laska Papaya Salad  If you're Vietnamese, you will be disappointed. All of their food had a strong perfume taste and smell to it! Especially the papaya salad! It tasted like soap! My friend and I both had a bite and the scent was so strong we had to ask one of the servers to take it off our table. This place really love their lemongrass because almost all of the dishes had it and it was so overwhelming. The dumpling was good and it tasted fresh but not good enough for me to come back for it again. Some dishes just isn't meant to be changed or \"infused\". I feel like most restaurant like these put fusion in their names to justify their overpricing."}
{"text":"Overpriced but the food is good. The appetizers are extremely small too. The busting boba tea is pretty good as well as the sushi."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. Nice looking place, just a little odd with the long tables and benches in the back where eight people could sit. I sat at one end, with a couple at the other, no problem, but we shared an eight foot bench, just seems like s strange choice. Ordered chicken wontons, which were very good, and chicken shrimp pad Thai, which had been recommended to me by a friend, plus hot tea. The pad Thai was pretty good, but uneven, a large clump of noodles which had stuck together from before cooking, so no sauce mixed into the solid mass. The chicken was nicely done and the shrimp large, overall a nice flavor. However, typically pad Thai has a hot sweet tang to it and this was not quite up to other versions I have eaten (it is one of my favorite dishes). Nicely chopped peanuts, not enough sprouts. Waitress was very nice, service good. I will be back, there were other very interesting looking dishes on the menu, and the place is worth a second look.  Third time here and I now understand the reviews and stars for this place, which didn't seem to live up to my experience. Six days ago I had lunch here, bun bo hue. It was one of the best dishes I have ever had. The broth was reddish and spicy, needed nothing added, was absolutely delicious, and the beef excellent. Stayed on my mind, that's how good it was  So, today after driving back from Asheville, and after thinking about this dish the whole way, I stopped by for dinner and ordered the same dish. How disappointing!!! No reddish tint to the broth, just brown, spicy, but not the previous spicy that enhanced the broth's flavor, just spicy to be spicy. Not nearly enough salt, had to add quite a bit to give the broth some flavor.  From fantastic to very mundane in just two trips. The lack of quality control will be the downfall of this restaurant. Perhaps a new cook not experienced enough?  Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Great new addition to Waverly. Fresh sushi, yummy poke bowls and creative dishes and signature drinks. Bar can get crowded and there's no obvious place to wait for a table. CO should start accepting reservations especially on weekend nights."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the restaurant itself was beautiful. The curry laksa had a rich coconut curry broth with succulent chicken and shrimp. I also ordered the steamed buns, beef and kimchi dumplings, and chicken wings. I loved everything and would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after some friends recommended this place. We loved that they have vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. The tofu was cooked very well and we enjoyed the flavoring of the sauces in the fresh veggies. There is a good atmosphere with modern Asian-inspired decor and service was friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot. I love the decor inside and was very impressed with how awesome my server Mimi was. The drinks are delicious as well. I ordered pork belly buns and while they were a bit on the fatty side, even for pork belly standards, it was fresh, crisp ingredients throughout and I considered getting one to go! I then had the spicy tuna roll, it was good, nothing too groundbreaking. The poke is a great dish as well!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I'm not really feeling it this visit. My son bought me herr because this is one of hus favorite restaurants and I loved it when he first bought me here. It took someone forever  to come over and get me something to drink.  I ordered the spicy crab Rangoon and they weren't hot, I hope this isn't a sign of how the entree is going to be.  I just received the new batch of Rangoon and I can smell them so I know they are hot.  It's now 8:09 and she just came back to ask if I was ready to order. She walked all around me and even stood at the table beside me and talked to some guys that just sat down, having a full fledged conversation and then walked to the table behind me and asked the 2 ladies if they were ok!!! I'm so pissed off it's not funny. O will definitely talk to mgt before I leave!!!!!  The ending was great,  the food Thai basil steak was excellent and the crispy wonton cheesecakes, with a side of strawberry preserves was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Co  When we first walked in, we were confronted by a hostess with the phone up to her ear. It was tough to tell if she was talking to us or to a customer on the phone. They took our number and quoted us our wait time.  We went ahead and walked around outside for a little until we received a call that our table was ready - quicker than we were quoted.   When we sat down, we were given the chance to order our drinks. We got a water and a lychee iced tea. He water was great. The tea tasted amazing - however - it was only about 5 sips and it was gone. The glass was mostly ice. At $3 for a drink like this, you'd assume it would come with refills... Unfortunately, that was not the case.   Overall throughout the meal, there was a theme of things being under seasoned.  If it weren't for the hot sauce provided, everything would have been really bland.   We ordered the pork belly buns and the spring rolls as an appetizer. There were two pork belly buns and 2 spring rolls cut in half. They were ok. I've certainly had much better at other restaurants and made at home.  For our meals, I had the masa ramen and my girlfriend had the Pad Thai.  Again, both under seasoned.  This is the first time I have seen corn in ramen, and it didn't quite jive for me. The garlic they added was over cooked, so it gave off that burnt garlic fragrance and a bitterness throughout the dish.  The noodles seem to be instant ramen noodles that they've used - far from the quality of ramen you can get at other places around town.   Overall, I likely won't find myself coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the decor is absolutely stunning. They also have a really nice outdoor seating area.  The staff is amazing and the cocktails are very unique and delicious. My husband had the dark and peach and LOVED it. I had the jalepeno margarita and it had just the right amount of heat. These are definitely not your run of the mill cocktails and you won't be disappointed!   All of our food was incredible as well! We had the gyoza appetizer, a firecracker roll and the spicy beef pho. I will be ordering them all again! I love spicy, so the beef pho was perfect! (They also have it not spicy!) overall we were VERY impressed with CO and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is decent, but not outstanding. The food lacks kick for an Asian place.  The drinks are very good and the atmosphere is nice, it is just the food underwhelms. Read more at: http://eatitcharlotte.com/2016/05/24/co/"}
{"text":"Good food. Wish the staff was a bit more friendly...I've also had better ramen but I'm a huge fan of the dumplings. I recommend."}
{"text":"Finally!   Another CO closer to home in Charlotte.   I love eating at the Park Rd location, now there is another option for South Charlotte.    Opening night I took a group of friends who aren't much into diverse food and they really loved it.    The food was on point, exactly as the Park Rd location.  We had assorted apps and my favorite Pad Thai.   The place has some really cool design features...I love the wood ceiling and antiqued mirrors inside.    Some of the staff were in training as it is a new location and to be expected.    We had a great time and will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Have been to CO in Charleston and Myrtle.  So glad we finally have CO in Charlotte.   I went with a group of friends on the opening night and everything was great as expected.   The decor is incredible and I highly recommend the Pad Thai...my fav.   They are still new and working out the kinks but this is my new go to spot!"}
{"text":"The Banh Mi is great. It's a great lunch spot and the indoor architecture is beautiful."}
{"text":"Used to go to CO all the time for sushi but in the past few months they have been using less fish and more rice. All the fish is very fresh tasting and other dishes are a great size and very reasonably priced. Today for lunch I just had two of the appetizer crab rangoons- the best rangoons I have ever had and get them EVERY TIME since the first time I've tried them."}
{"text":"I'll rate CO in the \"spectacular\" category. By far the best thing I've come across in Charlotte in the last 15 years. Everything works. Just pick something, anything, from the list and it will amaze you!  I'm usually a bit hard going on eateries. Check my other reviews. I mention this for comparisons sake. I'm not a softball kind of reviewer.  The only small gripe I have with CO is this: please lose the high top tables. I truly don't enjoy dangling my legs while I dine. High tops look fabulous in pictures but \"in use\" ... not so much.  That being said, the menu is so wonderfully executed, I would be willing to sit on the curb or on a turned over painter's pail. Don't be fooled by the strip mall location, CO is an Exquisite dining experience!"}

{"text":"Maybe CO will turn out to be a good restaurant but it is not yet there.  As others noted the entrance is terrible as the front door feels like a side door with no real entrance.  We arrived at 11:15 for lunch with only one other group there.  My wife and I waited 10 minutes for drinks and it never improved from there.  Even when the Server noted my drink was empty and she would be right back with a refill, it took 15 minutes and I was already done with my meal.  The steamed pork buns had good flavor but the pork was over cooked and tough.  My wife's pho was ok.  My pork belly bahn mi was terrible.  There was so little meat or veggies inside every bite was basically bread.  I eat bahn mi and/or pho several times a week at two other restaurants in Charlotte and this was beyond crazy.  At $9.50 the sandwich should be at least ok, this was the worst bahn mi I have ever had.  The pictures show how little was inside.  One \"half\" had one bite of meat and the other half had little more.  There was more meat in the appetizer steamed buns than in the bahn mi.  I hope Co does other dishes well and bahn mi is just a menu filler.  Again, my wife said the beef pho was fine so there may be hope.    For me, even living only 5 minutes away is not enough for me to return.  Poor service and terrible food was enough of a first impression for me."}
{"text":"Despite absolutely loving the CO in Charleston, the Waverly CO has disappointed me 3x in a row. The service has been consistently terrible and the food orders incorrect.   When seated outside at a patio table, the server was rarely seen. But I thought it would be different inside. No. First, the hostess gave a 45 min wait time. Next the bartender was so overwhelmed (she was the only one on a very busy Saturday night), it took 20 min to get drinks. While waiting and then sipping our drinks, we noticed that one bar table for 4, one patio table for 4, and 3-4 inside tables were all empty. Consistently. So the entire hour we waited, there were multiple empty tables. That means that seating isn't happening efficiently (despite two hostesses who did not appear to be overworked).  After waiting for 55 minutes, we checked with the hostess, who let us know - SURPRISE! - our table was being cleaned and almost ready. We told her we were in the bar, and after 5 more minutes, we once again checked back with her. She then pointed to our empty table. It would have been GREAT if she had either told us to come wait at the hostess stand until our table was ready or come to get us in the bar.   Once seated, we realized the server was overwhelmed too because she was overtly unpleasant. We ordered drinks, water and appetizers as soon as she came by. Our waters hadn't arrived 30 min later. When we asked her for waters, she said \"you're going to have to give me a few minutes.\"  Unsurprisingly, at this point, the food arrived incorrect. An order for edamame gyoza was delivered as edamame spring rolls. One drink was wrong. And one noodle dish was super dry but the server didn't come around often enough to ask for a sauce or something to help it.   Terrible experiences. I wanted to love it as I'm enjoying the new Waverly area, but I'm going to pass from now on. There are too many other competing restaurants to continue the disappointment here.   Food review: -Malaysian chili wings are ok -Curry laksa is good but the no-chicken order had chicken in it -edamame spring rolls are incredibly greasy  -fried pork belly bun is greasy but tasty with the house hot sauce -no amount of hot sauce can fix the dry tasteless tofu banh mi -Hanoi noodles were dry.  -Bombay chai tea is just a packet of Tazo chai. Ok, but this is what I drink at home for 15 cents a packet   **On a positive note, the fried vegetarian sushi (crispy veg roll) is really good."}
{"text":"This place almost lost my business on my first and only visit due to the hostess not being knowledgeable of the special.   Let's set the scene: I arrived back in Charlotte from a vacation with my family and messaged my girlfriend as I saw a promotion on FB that the next day was National Mojito Day and CO (listed all locations in other states as well as this Charlotte location) was inviting people out to celebrate with $5 Mojitos various flavors.  I arrived 10minutes after my girlfriend who I invited and her sister who Birthday it was and they were seated at a high top table with a look as if I steered them wrong. I entered and immediately thought \"How Cute, I can't believe I've never been here before as I frequent Chopt, Juice Bar & other businesses in this shopping center\". I approach the ladies and said \"Happy National Mojito Day\" they smirked and said he hostess said there is no such thing happening. I asked our server for a manager with the post pulled up from the CO facebook page ready to show HOWEVER I didn't need to after I mentioned why we were there he welcomed  us and I informed him that the hostess was unaware as well as the server and he apologized and went to speak with both of them as well as other staff to inform their customers.  We started off with Pineapple Mojitos which were Ooh so good and after one I needed food, well we all needed food because it was dinner time and we hadn't ate so we requested a menu and began to order. I had the curry shrimp dish which was full of flavor and a sushi roll. The food was so full of flavor and fresh, I raved about it on the phone with my husband on the way home. We will definitely be back for date night hopefully there isn't any specials announced that the staff is unaware of."}
{"text":"Good Food, Terrible Service  I'm currently writing this review as the table next to me left after being neglected for fifteen minutes. As a new restaurant, I can understand a few issues with service as the staff is fairly new, but there's a problem when it's been thirty minutes and your server hasn't returned with your drink. Upon entering the restaurant, there was confusion among the staff with something as simple as getting a table. This isn't a one-time issue, for this is the second time I'm eaten at this location. The first time, my waiter did not know the menu at all and blamed all issues on the newness of this location. The waiters also don't know what food is being delivered to tables, and I also experienced a shortage of forks.   If you are willing to survive horrendous service, the food is definitely worth it. It's a little pricey, but everything from the appetizers to the entrees are amazing. I recommend the com chien, but it's up to you to decide if good food is worth this terrible experience.  Update: Another table left upon hearing that there were no forks when their food arrived after already waiting for an hour, and my waiter tried to take my food while I was still eating."}
{"text":"Happy food--Gyoza Dumplings are deliciousness and leave you wanting a second helping!!  Both of us loved the gyoza dumplings more than the kimchi/beef dumplings though they are a close second.  We tried a variety of dishes to share -- Sushi favorites --Spider roll & Spicy tuna crunch rolls --both have a savory sauce and nice balance of spicy and sweet in the spider roll. The pork belly buns are heaven in one bite! They have the sweet salty pork, the honeyed dough of the bun and your tastebuds start dancing!!   Also, I love the decor and the urban sophisticated vibe of CO. We came for lunch on a week day so there was no wait. I would like to visit again and try the pho next time. The house made hot sauce was super spicy and fantastic!"}
{"text":"The Phad Thai Chicken to-go portions appear smaller now. Price is $15, kinda steep. It's good, but not that good. Thai Taste has the same thing for nearly half the price."}
{"text":"Since it opened, I've been intrigued by this place but upon reading other reviews, have hesitated on actually making the trip. We finally decided to grab some dinner here but, unfortunately, it was not what we had anticipated and hoped for.  I think the menu is unique and special and the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice. The service on the other hand (for what seemed to be a slow evening) was extremely slow and all of the employees resembled zombies. Literally. Zombies. No one smiled, they moved in slow motion and there was no customer service.   After we were seated for a few minutes, our server came over to take our drink order. We each ordered a water, I ordered a Vietnamese limeade and he ordered a beer. The Vietnamese limeade was not for me but he enjoyed the beer. When we were finally able to order, we asked for the beef and kimchi dumplings and the crab and pork spring rolls to start then he ordered the Korean short rib banh mi and I ordered the Korean rice bowl. The appetizers were amazing! The dumplings were so flavorful with this hidden spice that I loved. The spring rolls were good too (love the pickled carrots that came on the side). When we received our entrees, they appeared to be delicious. While he enjoyed his banh mi (I tried it and it was good), my Korean rice bowl was utterly disappointing. The rice was extremely over cooked and mushy and there was, surprisingly, no flavor.   Overall, it wasn't the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant but it will be awhile before I return to give it another shot. (Especially if the customer service stays the same.)"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are good. Happy hour specials are good. Probably better for a happy hour with friends or casual date night for drinks. Not exactly kids friendly and the layout is weird. Servers are attentive but the hostesses appear somewhat indifferent to be working. Has potential with the food and drinks"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite restaurants since they opened but I was kind of disappointed when I took my girlfriend there for her first experience and when our food came out we had a piece of hair in it. Which I understand things happen, but I was kind of thrown off when they still charged us for it after sending it back and bringing us another one, which we couldn't finish because by that time we were running late."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were excellent, our waitress was helpful in explaining things on the menu. Our server however needed some training don't reach across another person to serve. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I came here tonight after hearing about the incredible service and impeccable food. However, I am leaving CO feeling very conflicted. Myself and my two friends came in tonight about an hour and a half before closing. In my opinion, that is completely acceptable (I am a server at a restaurant and personally don't feel this was rude). Our server made us feel very rushed the entire time. I could understand if our server was trying her best to accommodate, but she actually avoided our table and we had to walk around and find her at one point.   My boyfriend ordered a lychee boba and she told us they couldn't make them. No biggie. The three of us ordered several dishes to share so we could try a little bit of everything. The dish I was most excited about was the Edamame Gyoza, so we ordered it. Twenty minutes later the server comes back and says the kitchen can't make it. She asks us if we would like to order another appetizer, so we order the Crunchy Spring Rolls. Twenty minutes later, another server comes back and says those can't be made either. I'm not one to complain about service because I know how it is working in a restaurant, but this experience left me a bit perturbed. Half off the stuff we ordered couldn't be made. If we had come in twenty minutes before close, I could understand. We were there 90 minutes beforehand. It seemed as if the kitchen didn't want to make anything so they could close up even though they still had a while to go.   The food we did get to eat was great, although I'm leaving hungry. Not sure if I would come again and play Russian Roulette with the kitchen and see what could and couldn't be made."}
{"text":"Read the yelp reviews before going so had a game plan on the food.  For my husband and I we got the curry shrimp appetizers, drunken noodles and spicy tuna sushi.  Every item was delicious.  My favorite was probably the shrimp curry appetizers.  Also not usually cocktail people but decided to be adventurous and go for the basil Collins and blackberry bourbon fizz.  Both were very good and we were surprised how much we enjoyed them.  Was surprised how casually everyone was dressed, but it was 6:30 PM on a Sunday night.  We decided to go then hoping for a short wait and we were right-seated right away.  We will definitely be back and very happy with everything we ordered!"}
{"text":"On Election Day 2016, CO offered half priced Pho bowls. Pho has become one of my \"things\" here recently, so I decided to give it a shot. I looked over the menu before hand and decided on the pho bo vien, a noodle bowl made of meatballs, and rice vermicelli, herbs, served in a beef broth. I arrived soon after their opening time of 11:00am.  There wasn't a designated front of the house person but the staff did a good job of rotating the waiters in and out as guests arrived.  The place was still pretty empty with a few tables occupied. I was seated and told of the half priced Pho bowls special.I promptly ordered my Pho bowl. As I waited, I looked over the menu. There were a number of items that caught my eye, especially the chili wings, the ahi poke, and the Dark & Peach cocktail. Wait time was a little longer than expected. I received my hot and fragrant pho bowl with all the fixings after about 20 minutes of waiting. I dove in to find a bundle of noodles covered with broth. By the end of my meal, I was still digging through the noodles in search of more delicious broth! I would've enjoyed more broth and less noodles. Next time, I will make a request for less noodles to avoid this issue. By the time I left, the lunch rush was in full swing. There was also a greeter at the front of the house who wished me well as a I left the restaurant. I'll be back to try the bar bites, the cocktails, and maybe a different bowl."}
{"text":"I love the Park  Road location, both food and service and was so looking forward to Co in Waverly. Tonight was my 3rd visit to Waverly and most disappointing. The food was tasty and well prepared....but the service was lackluster, food debris on floor and seat on the red banquette seat and dirty dishes left on table. Sanitation rating was 93, concerning in a sushi restaurant.  Every time the door opened we would get a blast if icy cold air.  The design of the entrance door is mid seating area and the hostess station is off in the corner.  This place badly needs some kind of sally port to separate the entrance from the dining area and the hostess station needs to be near the door... who designed this?  Park  Road is so efficient and beautiful this looks like you enter the restaurant by a side door"}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere.  The blackberry infused sake was excellent.  I ordered spicy beef pho and it lit me up.  I was sweaty pretty much the entire meal but I loved the flavor.  The curry laksa was sweet and a bit spicy but also very good.  Highly recommend the Malaysian wings as a started.  Sweet and tangy and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Quite likely my favorite spot right now. The apps are out of control delish. The king fu crunch is my go to!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, but the service is comically bad.  I ordered two starters for the table, very clearly identifying them as appetizers for the group, and then after the server took everyone else's entree orders, he just left.  I had to get up and find him, and he explained that he thought I had already ordered for myself.  Both appetizers came out at the same time as the entrees, which took 25 minutes.  They have different servers bringing the food, and they don't know the dishes---one server kept asking who had the ramen at our table (nobody), but it was actually pho and I had to point that out to the server.  No water refills.  They're very nice, but poorly trained.  On the food side, the curry laksa is excellent and the pork and crab spring rolls were superb.  Also, the chopsticks they give you are way too small--you get better ones with takeout Chinese.  I'll go back for the food, but if the service doesn't improve, I won't make it a regular place."}
{"text":"The food was alright But not worth the price and the service was slow it took about 30mins to even get food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I love the edamame spring rolls and the spicy udon noodles are awesome. I would definitely recommend eating at Co. All of the staff are great and the food is fairly priced."}
{"text":"We tried CO for the first time tonight with large group of 10. I would not recommend a group this large for CO, they are not suited for large groups. I ordered Hanoi noodles with sausage. My wife ordered beef pho. Mine was excellent, my wife's was ok (not ton's of flavor) however they do provide a spicy singapore sauce on the if you want to heat things up. My one and only complaint is food service was ridiculously slow. Approximately an hour and half for entrees to arrive. Grant the restaurant was busy, but it is a small place so it shouldn't take that long. Will try again with just two people."}
{"text":"So interesting you can go to the same restaurant on the same night and other reviewers have a completely different experience.  Went to Co on Friday night (10/6/17). Not sure if they take reservations, but we didn't have one.  There was a 20 minute wait- no biggie- we went to the bar and had a drink.  Service at the bar was good!  Within the 20 minute time frame we were seated.  All good so far:) . We started with another round of drinks and they gyoza.  Everything came out promptly and was delicious!  From here is when things went south.  We ordered another order of gyoza and after waiting about 15-20 minutes with no order showing up, our waiter says they are now out of the gyoza.  Really?  At that point we ordered another drink another appetizer to replace the gyoza that they were out of.  After about 15 minutes the appetizer comes out, but no drinks.  We flag our waiter down and he says he is working on getting our drinks out.  Another 20 minutes later, our food comes out, but still no drinks.  We are halfway through our dinner and I decide to go inside myself, go to the bar and see what the holdup was.  No really good explanation other than they were out of the wine we wanted.  Huh?  That seemed to do the trick and I was promptly served the drinks we ordered 45 minutes prior.  I don't know if it was just an inexperienced waiter who was over his head or the restaurant wasn't prepared for the crowd, but they need to get it together.  The food was really good though and I would give that a solid 4.5.  Service, not so much."}
{"text":"I stopped in last night to celebrate my birthday.  There were only two of us, and when we approached the hostess, she was on her phone.  We asked about the wait, and she quoted us 40 minutes.  I gave her my information, and asked if she would be texting me when the table was ready.  Her condescending response, combined with the look she gave me, was so incredibly rude, it was enough for me to walk out with no intention of ever going back.  I'm disappointed, I had been looking forward to this restaurant as a fun addition to the Waverly shopping center."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a decent meal and overall experience here. I'd give them 3.5-4 stars overall, which sounds like it's right around the average. While people have complained about the service before, we had great service which is why I'm giving 4 stars over 3. If it were just based on food, it would be closer to a 3.   We were in around 8ish on a Wednesday night. It was busy when we arrived, but were able to get seated quickly. The inside is beautiful, especially the golden arch over the bar. We were greeted quickly by our server, who was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu. She took time to explain it all, and even to try to teach me how to use chopsticks!  I started off with the basil thai collins cocktail, with gin, basil, honey syrup and lemon. It was very good. My husband had the blackberry infused sake. I'm not a huge saki lover but this was enjoyable.   Judging by reviews, we started off with the beef and kimchi dumpings. I would have liked more of a beef predominance there - and there is some spice here! You get four dumpings, which is pretty good. We also ordered the tofu summer rolls - I thought these lacked on flavor, so I needed to use extra hoisin peanut sauce. I wouldn't order these again.   Our main meals were better. We split the chicken and shrimp pad thai, which was very good. We also had the rainbow sushi roll. The one thing I wasn't crazy about with the sushi rolls was that they were a little soft and didn't hold together well. My rolls all fell apart before I was able to eat them, which was a little disappointing. The fish was good though.  If we return, I'd love to try a wok noodle dish and some more of the cocktails."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that you can't substitute fried rice for white rice in their dishes. Can't even pay extra to change it. Instead, you can purchase an order of fried rice and have white rice, too. Clearly a way to get double the price on already expensive lunch. Nice food, but don't expect to get anything any different than how they put it. Second and last time here."}
{"text":"Yessss. To everything Co is offering. I'm saying YES.  I loved this place! I loved the vibe and all the decor. Just know that I'm already looking forward to coming back and grabbing a drink and some of the happy hour goodies!   But on to the food!   I started with the chicken wontons and they were delish! Crispy wontons...packed with chicken! You really can't go wrong. The highlight was the plum sauce! Such a nice addition! I also tried the Curry Shrimp. I loved the curry sauce. It's really great for dipping the bread! I recommend ordering extra...you'll want it.    After seeing all the pictures on Yelp I couldn't wait to try pho - for my first time ever! I tried the Curry Laksa. The spicy broth had so much flavor. Geesh. I had no idea what to expect and this dish literally blew me away! If you're wondering what to order....get this dish!   I enjoyed the whole meal and my experience. I'm a huge fan! And I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about CO. The atmosphere is more upscale than other restaurants in Park Road Shopping Center, but it's not stuffy. I went on a Monday night, thinking it would quieter, but I still had to wait 30 minutes for a table. The food was well worth the wait. After ordering, it only look 10 minutes for the food to come out. I got the Curry Laska on the recommendation of our server and it was fantastic! The portion was so large, I took over half of it home. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I will definitely be back to try Co!  Hubby had the green curry and I had the Curry Laksa, the signature dish. Soooo happy with mine! Would have it again in a hot minute - spicy, filling and tasty.  I may try the beef pho next time I'm there, but the Laksa will be my go-to.  I recommend this place for sure and love that Park Road Shopping Center has a new and different place to enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have to echo a lot of what others are saying. We ate here recently and I really enjoyed the energy and ambience of this establishment. Our waitress was very kind but the service was slow-- I be they are simply understaffed. As others have noted, if you get here around 630p you can expect to have to wait probably 45 minutes for a table; also they dont take reservations and the phone number listed here on yelp and on their website doesn't work!  The food: there's a good variety on the menu and the prices are reasonable but not cheap. Since this was restaurant week, they had 1 app + 1 small salad + 1 entree for $20. We had the pad thai and beef pho; both dishes were just so-so. Both of these can be found definitely better elsewhere.   I really wanted to give this place 4 or 5 stars because of the great reviews their other locations had, but its simply not deserving; I wish I could chalk it up to them being new, but I think being open 2-3 months should be enough time to get most of the kinks out. We might come back to give it another shot. This place caters well to the population nearby and fills in a need: an uptown-style restaurant located without the need to drive, a nice bar, and passable food. I think CO will do well."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Place was packed on a Tuesday night but we are able to sit at the bar.  Service was a little slow at first but we were acknowledged immediately which is a sign a good customer service! Once we got our beverages, we ordered rather quickly and the food came out timely and was hot/ or cold the proper presentation for the items we ordered.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"CO means feast in Vietnamese!  One of the best compliments I can give them is the Thai food tastes like Thai food and the Japanese food tastes like Japanese food.    Trendily dressed young people and spicy Asian food.  Nowhere near as loud as Ru San's thank God!    Lots of attention to detail on the food.  I love the sushi rolls and gyoza.  Banh mi sandwich is spicy but not too spicy if you hold the pepper!  And the mixed drinks are unique.  Will be back again to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"We ordered the pork belly steamed buns and pad Thai. The buns had so much hoisin sauce on it you couldn't taste anything else. We sent it back and they made it again but the pork was not very good. We were really looking forward to this place but we were so disappointed. The pad Thai was ok can't touch basils pad Thai and futo buta has amazing pork belly buns this didn't taste authentic at all"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. You can't go wrong with any menu item. The soups are warming on a cold winter day and the sushi is great as well. Deff check this place out !"}
{"text":"Best Sake ever. Bartenders are so great in helping find the right one! So helpful. They went through all the options and ensured we were comfortable with the right one. Super friendly with great food and great drinks."}
{"text":"The food here is great. However the service is terrible. If you want a great Asian fusion restaurant, go to Co, but definitely not this location. Opt for the Park Rd location instead. Last night at Co I can identify singularly as one of my worst dining experiences I've ever had period. Like I said the food and drinks are great, but the service is frankly insufficient. Nobody gave us menus when we sat down, we had to ask for them. After asking for our menus we waited 20 minutes before we asked if we could order drinks, another 20 minutes before again, WE asked if we could order food. Food took about 30 minutes to prepare. However, they were very busy so I'll be forgiving in regards to that.   While sitting at the bar I noticed that the jar of blackberries had mold growing in it, which working in the fine restaurant business before I realize can happen. Sometimes you get a shipment in that already has something growing in it maybe at the bottom where you don't see it. I alerted the bartender/waitress that there was mold growing in the jar, and that I wasn't grossed out but others might be. She actually ignored me the first time I said it, and after alerting her again she made zero eye contact with me and just removed the jar from the top of the bar to behind the bar on the shelf. Never once thanking me for catching that or even apologizing for that.   I like this place's food so I wish that they would do well. But if they don't improve in their service especially on our side of town, they unfortunately won't do well. People talk and right know nobody's saying good things about this Co location. (Park Rd rocks)"}
{"text":"Food: drunken noodles, curry laksa, pressed sushi (tuna and salmon), and pork dumplings were all delicious. Chili wings was ok. I had better.   Service: both times we had an Asian lady. I can't remember her name but she was awesome! She just moved from the west coast.   Price: this is why CO lost one star with me. While the food is delicious, the price is little high for what it is. Both times we had 2 appetizers and 2-3 entrees and we cleaned our plates like some starving kids and I wasn't completely full. The portion is smaller than most places. Given the same amount of items ordered at most restaurants, I would usually leave with a full stomach and possible leftovers for the next day.   Lastly, please add more items to the desserts section. I've always wanted some sweet to end the night there but after glancing at the options, MEH."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Ashley was a great server. We will be back very soon. We look forward to try some of the other sushi rolls."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times since its opened and haven't had a single bad thing on the menu! Amazing service for a party of 2 to a group of 25! Best menu items are Hanoi yellow curry noodles, salmon avocado lemon pressed sushi, tofu buns, beef kimchi dumplings, and the lychee blackberry cooler beverage! Everything tastes amazingly authentic. This is not just your average Asian food restaurant; it's truly a unique dining experience at very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the curry laksa here!! So good and big enough to share.   Today I tried the Hanoi noodles, pretty good. Still think the laksa is the best thing on the menu.  My server Sophia was perfect."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, separate menus for gluten free and vegan diners and great service.  Their branded sauce is really good too - spice with substance.  The food was delicious and cooked to order with generous portions.  Highly recommend the edamame spring rolls and spicy udon noodles!"}
{"text":"Unfortunate service snafus ruin good cuisine. On a Sunday eve there was no manager on site just a disinterested hostess. The kitchen or waiter forgot two of our dishes but when we finally got them the food was 4 star worthy. Hopefully, upper mgt will take note of the disastrous service reviews on Yelp and turn this restaurant around."}
{"text":"We either got very lucky...or the other reviewers were very unlucky...because my experience here was great. The service was friendly and efficient, and the food was fantastic. My tuna roll was delicious and my daughter's pho was excellent. The portions are plenty big, and the prices are EXTREMELY reasonable...especially when compared to the many, many overpriced eateries around Charlotte. We had 2 entrees and 2 appetizers (no drinks) ...for $40. You're not going to get any better than that! I highly recommend this place. Oh, and the outside patio is very quaint and pretty."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been meaning to try CO for a while. On a whim, on a Saturday, on Valentines day weekend, we decided to walk in and give this place a try. Not surprisingly, we were quoted over a 1 hour wait. Not a big deal, as we have passed a fair amount of wait times at the bar. At the end of the night, what impressed me the most about this place was the attention given by the wait staff and manager.   First off the ambiance of this place gives off a club feel. A clean-cut look, decently loud club-like music, and a breathtaking center bar with arching wood beams set the stage. My wife and I grabbed a glass of wine each at the bar to start. The bar selection was both decent in reach and price, with the focus being on local draft beer and mixed cocktails.   After what felt like a while, we went back to the front desk to check in on our wait. We found out that the guy working the front desk was actually the general manager, Mike, who turned our night around. This guy was slammed with phone calls and new customers walking in the door, however he handled it like a champ. On top of that, he took the time to walk us through the menu, point out his favorite items, and gave us regular updates on our table to make sure we were seated quickly and were happy. That kind of detail goes by a lot of people.  The meal was also fantastic. We shared the beef and kimchi dumplings, pork belly buns, and the thai green curry. While the dumplings were spicy (how I like more than a few aspects of my life), they were delicious. I also enjoyed the pork belly buns. However, they both paled in comparison to the green curry. My wife even drank the sauce straight from the bowl! It was a bet, however she didn't seem to need much persuasion!  What started out as a ho-hum experience turned into a great night thanks to the great staff at CO and the wonderful cooks churning out great meals. I look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our meal here again! This was our third visit. Our favorite items included the Pork and Ginger Gyoza, Spicy Crab Rangoon, the Curry Laksa (Fantastic!), and the Thai Basil Chicken-- it was all delicious."}
{"text":"Had a great time when my boyfriend and I went for date night a couple of weeks ago. Ambience was lovely, and the vegan menu made my day. Will be back soon. Eager to try lunch there. I only wish that they had more tofu entree options on the vegan menu."}
{"text":"Looking for a cool spot to take some friends from out of town? Or just a solid place for dinner? Co is your move today. This place offers wonderfully prepared Asian and Vietnamese dishes that are sure to impress. It has a little bit of everything but none of the boring stuff. Bhan Mi, Noodles & Ramen and Curry so there's something to satisfy everyone - even good ol' salads. Oh and with all this great food, tag an an awesome interior decor, the center spindle tree is a masterpiece!  Ps. The Korean Short Rib Bhan Mi and Masa Ramen are the winner's from what I tried!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came on a Friday night to try it out. Having read about lackluster service from a couple of reviews, we were skeptical.  But, I have to say it was really great.  Our server \"Tori D. \" was 99.9% the factor. In this review. In our experience, especially with a grand opening of any restaurant, the food can be the best ever but it's the 'growing pains' that can have a negative effect on a business. Tori's hard work and excellent job combined with the explosion of flavor in the food what won us over. We had the beer & kimchi dumplings the edamame gyoza the Korean rice bowl and the super crunch roll. Dumplings were amazing and gyoza id give an A-. Great flavor and broth on gyoza was to die for. The rice bowl had the sunny side up egg and spicy kimchi so people looking for this will absolutely love it. Super crunch roll was something I could eat every day. Wow. Great food and a wait staff like her will bring us back! Favorite item - \"Super Crunch\" roll."}
{"text":"I dream about the dumplings and Vietnamese Ramen. So glad they opened one closer to me. I love this place"}
{"text":"Here goes: Wait for table wasn't bad at 25 minutes on Friday night at 6:30. Bar has way too many stools. Seats do not rotate and because  crammed so tightly in the small space that you have to pull it fully out into path of kitchen traffic and other waiting patrons. Worst part was the wait once you ordered. Once we flagged down someone asking about our order they appeared to remember at least part of our table - they brought out two dinners leaving the other half of table without food for another 10 minutes. Then brought out the third diner's food. I was the very last person to get my food after waiting another five minutes and I had raw sushi. Table next to ours experienced same thing. Food was ok but not fantastic. Noodles undercooked for the other folks in our party. Could tell my sushi roll had been sitting out for awhile. Manger brought my roll out apologizing giving us free desserts  which we did not get. This visit was for a friend's birthday. Overall not worth the wait and just frustrating and embarrassing experience for us who chose to take her there to celebrate said birthday. Hope for their sake they get it together."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant of all time. I have been coming to CO for two years now. My friends (and Instagram and Snapchat followers) know I am here on a weekly basis (often multiple times a week....I should have ownership rights at this point) and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I will start by saying my mom grew up in Southeast Asia- she lived in Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, so she knows real, authentic Asian food. I took her here and it's now her favorite Asian restaurant in Charlotte and can attest to its authenticity. The ambiance, decor, music, service, food and drinks are all excellent. There are great specials, but my favorites are Tuesday/Thursday for the half priced sushi rolls (from 4pm-7pm) and half priced sake carafes (all day). I am here weekly on one of the two days and usually sit at the bar. Garrett is an awesome bartender and Soo, the manager, is wonderful and has become a great friend. Oliver has also served me and is so friendly and gave great recommendations. If you sit at a table ask for Oliver. I truly have never had a meal or experience that I haven't enjoyed. My favorite drinks are the Jalapeño Margarita (has a good kick) and the Cucumber & BlackBerry sake infusions (both sweeter sake options). I would probably list half the menu if I mentioned what food items I like. All the sushi is delicious (my go-to is Kobe Jalapeño), Curry Laksa and Spicy Udon Noodles are my most favorite entrees. Com Chien is great too and you truly can't go wrong with any of the appetizers. My favorite is the Curry Shrimp but also love the Dumplings/Gyoza (both are excellent), Spicy Crab Rangoon, Edamame Spring Rolls and Mango Summer Roll. You genuinely can't go wrong with CO. I've never been such a big advocate or considered myself a \"regular\" at any restaurant but everything about CO warrants a weekly visit. I've taken all my friends here and they've never been unhappy. Anyone that posts a negative review is simply a negative human that wants to complain. If a mistake is ever made at this restaurant is immediately resolved by the staff. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is not up to par. The hostesses are very unwelcoming. In the past our servers have been extremely delayed, luckily today we were taken care of Tara, sweet server! The food is awesome! The Vietnamese ramen is amazing, all the apps on the small plates menu is bomb. Unfortunately I will not return to this location due to the unfriendly staff we have dealt with every time we dine."}
{"text":"We got a message from the owner that they had added a kids menu and we happily went back to try Co again.  This time, it was delicious!  We had the pork belly buns again - and they were still greasy, but not as - as well as the crab spring rolls which were very good.  We then had the drunken noodles and hanoi noodles and both were excellent (although the drunken noodles were much spicier than I anticipated).   Service was great and the cocktails were pretty good.  Overall, we will definitely walk back here more regularly!  Glad we gave it another chance!"}
{"text":"2nd visit here has proven to be a much better experience.  The lunch crowd was full as I would expect. The wait staff were handling it. My Order came out in reasonable time considering the place was packed.  Sushi roll, dumplings & edamame.  All were fabulous! The firecracker roll is delicious!  Good for lunch ? Yes ... definitely  two thumbs way up !     Food was good but service was incredibly slow. A total of 10 guests in the restaurant 5 tables.  It took  20 minutes to get my order of dumplings and sushi roll.   Never got offered a refill of beverage . I'll chalk this up to just opening and give this a chance to get better. Surely they'll get better."}
{"text":"So I'm always on the hunt for good pho. There's no amount of doctoring up that can fix a weak broth. This place brought it!!! I got the spicy beef pho and it was delicious! The portions are small. My kids ordered dumplings from the kid menu and got a toddler's portion, 4 dumplings and rice. My portion was filling for me. I also had the lychee tea with mango jelly. I loved it! Check this place out."}
{"text":"I would have gave it 5 stars but the service was so slow in even greeting us and also getting our check. It seemed like the waiter did not know how to count our change. The food was great no complaints there. The waiters just seemed not experienced at all and kept saying sorry the whole time. Although our food came out fast which was a plus."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. The manager is the real problem. He has issues with women. I was recently dining there with a friend. We were sitting there minding  our own business when the manager approached us. He was being very inappropriate with his comments and when I rejected him and said no thank you he promptly told us we should leave. We weren't doing anything wrong so we decided to stay. We had our meal which was barely edible and paid. When we walked out the door he followed us and told us that he hoped we enjoyed our meal because it was the last one we would have. And warned if we returned he would call the police. This guy needs to be called out on his chauvinist ways."}
{"text":"I'm definitely starting to become obsessed with this place. I've been here twice and each time was amazing!  I love the atmosphere, you can dress up or down and it all works here. I've only sat at the bar, but i got the same if by more attention if i had a regular table. I mean super friendly and knowledgeable staff! I love the happy hour and daily specials that allows you to try a lot of different items on their menu. My favorite this is the curry Laksa. It is the best! Not to mention it is huge! Bartender suggested that i take the broth home( because you will have a lot left) and reheat and add some rice! Yes thank you, a nice substitute the next day! Prices are reasonable and the drinks are great, try the sake on 1/2 carafe days(Tuesday and Thursday)!"}
{"text":"Wednesday night drink specials with $5.00 cocktails that are unique. We enjoyed pork and kimchi dumplings as well as spring rolls for appetizers. I had the chicken pad thai as my entree and and added a spice level of 2 (they have spice levels from 1 - 3 to choose from). The portion was big and food was delicious. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I get takeout from Co probably once a month, and the food is good. But I ate here for the first time the other night and it was a really good experience: good service, 1/2 price cocktails (Wednesday) and no surprise the food just tastes better when you eat there."}
{"text":"Been about 5 times and I still love it. The atmosphere is relaxing and its always crowded. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"All sorts of Asian foods (and mixed experiences)  Okay so I'm very conflicted on this place. The menu covers Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai, and even a bit of Korean. For those looking to try or get introduced to a variety of different foods from different Asian cultures I could recommend this place.  However, the taste of the food is also just as diverse. Out of the 4 dishes we ordered, 2 were surprisingly fantastic and 2 were pretty terrible.  +The Crab Rangoon ($5) - Flavorful, well sized, just crispy and sauced enough. It was delightfully portioned and pretty darn good.  +++The Masa Ramen ($14) - Holy cow! I go out of my way to eat ramen in every city I visit. I was not expecting to find such a good, clean, and well-balanced ramen here. It comes with a good portion of noodles and corn and the pork belly (which is dry in the buns) was actually very moist and delicious. Usually I go to Futo Buta for my ramen cravings when I'm in Charlotte but I may start coming here once in a while.   -Curry Shrimp ($8) - Shrimp tastes low quality, curry was subpar, and the bread (which was extra buttery) seemed to be doing its own thing.  -Pork Belly Buns ($6) - The most depressing looking (and possibly tasting) pork buns I've ever had. The buns felt like plastic and there were hardly any vegetables to add substance or balance to the bun.  Taste: 3.3/5 (4.5 for the first two and 2 for the last two) Atmosphere: 4/5 (The centerpiece here is super cool) Value: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Usually I order pho for takeout since I walk from home, but today I sat at the bar and enjoyed my meal in-house.  It was a slow Monday lunch hour and not busy.  I ordered an appetizer of spinach and water chestnut  dumplings in a lemongrass sauce that arrived in the proper amount of time.   The dumpling was cooked perfectly and I liked the cream sauce except it needed more salt IMO.  Unfortunately they did not have salt shakers avaliable,  but I ate it anyway.  I also ordered a bowl of pho ga with a good portion of shredded chicken.   It was piping hot and full of flavor.   It did,  however,  take some time to arrive even though the restaurant was not busy.  I agree with Jeff's review that the ratio of Thai basil to cilantro was heavy towards the cilantro.   I prefer to toss the cilantro for the taste of the Thai basil which is more authentic and available in abundance with most all the pho places in CLT.  Tameerah waited one me and did a great job.   Overall. I'm glad I stayed to eat.  Oh yea, I still took home a big container of left over pho for the road."}
{"text":"So a 4...server was good, a 5, didn't mess anything up and was polite and prompt. The food was a 3.  I had pho dac biet..alot of noodles and cilantro and skimpped on the meat and broth. The broth is crucial and it was not enough. I can go to a Viet restaurant and every bite of food has meat...the mass ramen my fiance got was wayyyyyyyyyyy too oily.  We dumped half and inch of broth onto a plate. Flavor were average.  Maybe try the sushi next time"}
{"text":"After my 1st visit and review, I was excited to take other friends back to CO.. Especially now I have a reason to get the Curry Laksa again.. We went on a Wednesday around 2:15pm. Angela (my lunch date) was already there!  I was greeted by Taheerah (our waitress) everything was swell! We ordered the Chili wings, pork and crab spring rolls and both of us ordered the curry laksa. Everything was going smoothly til Taheerah asked if we wanted her to wrap up the wings.. Angela said yes. Taheerah came back with the box, placed on the table and said, \"I would pack the food for you but I won't!\". She then laughed a little then walked off. Angela and I looked at ea other and said what's going to happen if she did. The wings going to blow up!! \"Well that was rude!\" When she came back later. I asked if she can finish her sentence in why she can't pack the food. This time don't laugh. She explained that she couldn't because she didn't have any chopsticks or tongs. She did offer then to pack it. I'm like no it's ok. I jut wanted to hear why..  The point to this is. IF she set the box down and have us pack it ourselves. I'm ok with it.. There's many places that do that. But no other places have said that to us before.. And that's my problem.  Taheerah did contact me via Yelp message and apologize. This is not usually her. And to come in this week for a complimentary gyoza after 4pm. At the end of the day it isn't about complimentary food. I'm in the service industry.. I rather have good service than free food. This incident leave a bad taste and it will be awhile before I introduce this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I was even introduced to this place. I never even knew of Waverly until I visited CO and I must say this will be my new fav hangout place especially with it being so close to work. The environment alone is very cute and trendy. The scenery is impeccable and I love the artwork and set up they chose for this restaurant. I was able to try their pineapple and blackberry infused sake. I also tried their dark and peach cocktail. The drinks were full of flavor the dark and peach being at the top of the list. I started with the spicy crab rangoon  moved to the Kung fu crunch roll and then moved to the Thai curry shrimp. I must say the spices in all of the dishes were spot on. It was the right amount of kick that kept you wanting more. I am still drooling over the spicy crab rangoon and can't wait to return for more. This a place I would most definitely recommend to others"}
{"text":"It's nice that they have such a wide selection of Asian cooking styles, but in general there wasn't much very good about our meal.  I had the Bun Xao with the tofu rolls as a starter and my husband had the pork bun and beef kimchi dumplings as starters and chicken curry for his meal  The tofu rolls and dumplings were decent.  The pork bun was greasy and heavy.  The bun xao was not very good.  Lemon grass sauce was inedible and the rice noodles were warm and over cooked.  My husband said the curry sauce was delicious but the chicken was too salty.  We went at a weird time in between meals so this may be why they were off their game, but we'll have a hard time going back to give them another chance."}
{"text":"It's not often that I eat out and feel the need to review something immediately!! However I feel sick... not sick the food was bad, but sick because I ate too darn much haha! My bff and I have decided that we are going to try to visit a new restaurant, (aka new to us), once a month. We started tonight at CO because our slacker selves hadn't exchanged Christmas presents yet. I know, terrible!! I should preface this by saying I love Asian food, minus anything alive or particularly squiggly, I'm into it all and this menu has a bit of everything. I ordered the Orange Blossom cocktail to start while I perused the menu. It was delicious and sneaks up on you while you drink it. I also later tried the pineapple/aperol drink. It wasn't as good. We took a long time to order because we couldn't figure out what to get (we wanted it all), However order we did. To start with I got the spicy crab Rangoon and she got the beef and kimchi dumplings. Both were really good, but be warned the Rangoon comes out molten hot (I burned the roof of my mouth lol). We couldn't decide between sushi and an entree so we decided we would each get both. I went with the pressed spicy tuna roll (good but not mind blowing), and she the caterpillar roll (she said it was good, I don't like eel). Now when it comes to entrees I hands down made the better choice! I went with the Korean rice bowl and it was so, sooo good, seriously the beef was perfectly cooked and all of the veggies were flavorful. The pickled carrots were love!! My bff went with the chicken Katsu banh mi. She liked it, but if I was her I would have had food envy!! Then we got dessert (did I mention we ate way too much food??). One tip, currently if you check in on Yelp you get an offer for a free dessert. We went with the cheesecake wontons, and they were amazing! Four small perfectly portioned wontons with what can only be described as orange blossom cheesecake, and candied orange rinds. I personally was in heaven.   The decor was nice, but not very comfortable. I seriously hate this trend of everyone having just high top tables. I'm short, not graceful, and I can't get in them without looking like an idiot. Luckily by the front window they had regular tables with little square cushion seats without backs. Overall I liked this place a lot... our waitress was nice but REALLY slow on service. You could tell she wasn't into it, I get it it's a Monday. So 4 stars it is, and I think I absolutely would come back for the rangoon, Korean rice bowl and the cheesecake wontons!!"}
{"text":"Met up with a couple friends during the lunch hour. Great new addition to Park Road Shopping Center.   If you are looking for great ambiance, the interior is fresh, modern, and cool. Ladies, careful when wearing heels...the floor is slick, or maybe it's how I walk. I dunno. Also, it could have been the company I was with or the acoustics, but at times it was difficult to hear my friends. Come with loud talkers.  We ordered 3 dishes: Hanoi noodles, com chien, and Thai green curry. Wow. Each dish was flavorful and spicy. I had to cut the noodles with a side of white rice just to tone it down a bit...but I loved every bite. Now that you know they start out spicy, you can ask them to go easy. If you want to add more fire to the sauce, they bring a bottle of their own mixture and it does add more kick. Plenty of food, be ready to take home leftovers.  The service was great. Very friendly. No judgement here when you ask for a fork."}
{"text":"CO is a great addition to Charlotte. I was hungry for a late lunch after shopping in the area and wanted some takeout.  They offer takeout toward the left of the bar. It only took ten minutes to get our food. We ordered the Shanghai Chicken Wontons, Pork Belly Buns and the Korean Short Rib Banh Mi. I was checking out what the people ordered and the ramen looked pretty satysfying. There was also a hot sauce on each table that appeared to be homemade. It reminded me of the garlic chili paste I have in my fridge. The guy gave me a cup to go and if you eat there, make sure to try some.  I don't know why I expected the buns to be steamed because they were actually buns almost like a savory doughnut. The pork inside was generous and flavorful. I think the wontons were nice but would have been yummier fresh. Again, my order was to go so that's all on me.  The bread is crunchy on the sandwich. I'm Fairly certain it was toasted.  The seating inside was fairly ample. The bar with the gorgeous wood structure is circular and people were eating lunch there at that counter/bar.  I saw that their iced coffee can be spiked with pecan Cathead vodka. Sounds pretty good!"}
{"text":"The only dish we haven't enjoyed was the bun.  Otherwise the sushi, the soups, the sandwiches, the blackberry lychee beverage are fabulous.  if you like it hot, try the drunken noodles or the curry.  If you are looking for something lighter, the sushi.  The soups are so filling & so tasty.    CO will not leave you hungry!!  Waits on weeknights can be a little long.  On the weekend if you come at prime time, forget about it.  They do take your number & will call you."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I was told to go for poke, and I went during dinner when they don't have the menu for that out. Once I asked the waitress, she said most people order that for lunch but happily brought us the menu to order. It was fresh and filling, after getting our check she offered us to-go cups for our drinks which I super appreciate. I'll definitely be back to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere gets a 10 out of 10 by far! I love the choices on the menu. I decided to go with a few small plates to be able to try a variety.   Curry Shrimp- Delicious. Comes with 6 shrimp in a spicy curry sauce and crispy burchetta on the side.   Pork Belly Steam Buns- I was a little disappointed because I love the pillow like buns that these are usually served on. They gave two buns which is pretty good for the price.   Beef and Kimchi Dumplings- My favorite! 4 dumplings with an amazing sauce over top! Dumplings were soft and tasty! Only $5 for 4 dumplings.  Beef Pho- (my date ordered this) I tried it ans trust me there was plenty to share. They served jalapeño, sprouts and other sauces were served on the side so you can spice how you like!    Our server was hard to understand with her strong accent but she delivered great service!   Next time I come I must try the cheesecake wontons!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent CO. The Pad Thai and Curry Laksa are two of our favorites. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to CO after finding it on yelp. It was already pretty busy when we got there but we still didn't have to wait longer than 5 minutes to be seated. We decided to start off with the Spicy Crab Rangoon. They were absolutely delicious! So good that I would return just for those. We also decided to get their Boba Tea but they were out of tapioca pearls. I got thai and my bf got milk - we both agreed that we've had better.  For dinner, I got the Malaysian Chili Wings and the Kung Fu Crunch. Both were so good! My bf hates sushi yet he ended up eating half of mine. He decided to get the Korean Rice Bowl for himself but did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed my food. Either way, I think CO is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"So a representative of our party came and started the hour wait for us. After 1 hour passed the hostess said they would try and pull two small tables together for our party of five. A few minutes later we watched them seat a party of two at our potential table. That was frustrating. Then we were seated at a bench with other people. It was very uncomfortable with nowhere to place your belongings like coat or purse. Not super hospitable..... I folded and sat on my coat.  Our waitress was very nice, Aspen was great. She was really accommodating. She should be helping her team mates with customer service. At this point, we are thinking the food had better be amazing.  The food do not disappoint! It was very good. Great seasonings and it came out in a timely manner! The signature CO hot sauce was delicious! Our party tried Hanoi Noodles, curry, sushi, Pho GA, and Bun bo hoi. All were delectable!    If you want a great take on pan Asian food, this is a good place to come if you aren't in a hurry. Be sure to plan for the wait and ask for Aspen as your server."}
{"text":"POSITIVE: ambiance, the korean bowl (needed more korean sauce to counter the rice), and spice crab rangoon (not spicy at all).   CONS: It took 10 mins for us to get a waitress once we sat down. We wanted to order 4 drinks with boba (tapioca) but they were out around 12:30 pm. WHAT?!?!?!?!! All drinks lacked the \"tea\" flavor. Food portions were extremely small, even for appetizers. The gyozas were literally the size of my big toe! 4 pieces for $5!!!!!!!!!! COME ON!!!!! We had the pho (okay) and fried rice with chinese sausage & shrimp (no flavor).  I was very disappointed since it seemed that this establishment would have their flavors on point to match the expensive menu.   I will stick to the korean restaurant/honey buns at SUPER G MART on Independence for the korean food, noodles, and milk tea with boba. Plus, their customer service is so much faster for half the price.   RECOMMENDATION: train the staff to hustle much more efficiently and get the flavors to a level of authenticity."}
{"text":"Flavor is really simple. Food doesn't feel fresh at all. Very grease and service very poor. I really hope CO improves its service and flavor. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Guys y'all can go through my Yelp account and look through it. I don't give bad reviews, I rather promote businesses and help my city grow. Being a business owner myself I take my feed back into consideration if there is a negative one.  But this place. Jesus Christ himself could change water into wine but can he change shit into a gourmet meal? Probably not.  Asian in fused food, viet food. My cultures food. THIS PLACE IS AN INSULT TO VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, FOOD AND THE COUNTRY ITSELF! it's that fucking bad. They must of used the unwashed ass hole of a pig to make their pork banh mi, I don't know what they are thinking or how could they possibly fuck up the taste of simple Vietnamese cooking.    And the prices wow seriously, ok I'll be considerate and understand that rent for that area is probably way higher than other locations and the place looks nice. But u are selling a menu not the view.   No it's not one bad experience so it's not from just a bad day, it's being dragged out with friends that also wanted to try it. Their comments and opinions are the same as mine but since I payed I'll comment on it.   The American people that eaten here and liked it. It's ok it's not your fault u don't know what things are suppose to taste like."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had the spicy Beef Pho and the Cambodian roll (out of this world). It's an easy location with lots of parking around and pretty cool decor inside. If you are in Meyers park and in the mood for some Pho or sushi I would totally recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Very good Pork gyoza and beers. BUT wait 40 mins gave us a lot of time to watched what gone by.  Slow service and the table clean up need a lot more clean.  Food every where on the floor, clean the table with the same wipe cloth for the whole time we were there. It was .....!!!! Not going back there again."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I am really impressed. Sat at the bar, Tori was our bartender/server. Excellent service. Drinks were delicious and food was GREAT. I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"I came here last night (Thursday) with a group of 5. We arrived at 6 to take advantage of HH specials ($3-$5 food specials) and 1/2 sushi, which they offer week days from 4-6:30, but HH goes till 7. We sat at a table vs. the bar and were told we would only be able to take advantage of the HH specials at the bar, which is typical. We were a little disappointed, but could still take advantage of 1/2 off sushi, plus on Thursdays they offer 1/2 off all sake!  My favorite sushi rolls of the night were the Firecracker (tempura shrimp, cucumber, avocado, spicy tuna, sriracha, spicy aioli, masago) and the Jersey roll (tuna, yellowtail, spicy salmon, avocado, cucumber, spicy aioli). Can you tell I like spicy?! We also had two beef rolls, which were unique- made with kobe beef and wagyu beef. All of the rolls ranged from $12-$15, but with half off sushi specials they were definitely worth it!  We also tried 3 different sakes, two of which were sake infusions served cold. The cucumber sake was refreshing, but the blackberry sake was the winner of the night. It was so delicious! If you're not a fan of typical hot sake, you should try the infusions.  Overall, great time at Co last night. We saw a couple of noodle and rice dishes come out of the kitchen and they looked amazing. We will definitely return sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection. Wonderful cocktails made w seasonal fruits. Everything we ordered was spectacular. Service was wonderful.  Charlotte has been lacking quality Asian fare for a long time. Charlotte should be rejoicing that we finally have such s great place."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a week. It has a chill atmosphere and a versatile menu. Strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had the drunken Thai chicken Noodles and lady had the laksha curry. Both were excellent. Thai chicken and curry dish were both spicy but very flavorful. Would definitely go again. Gyoza appetizers were excellent."}
{"text":"Coolest interior, nice staff, love, love, love. Neat drink menu both alcoholic and nonalcoholic so take the prego's. They will love you for it!   On to the food. I really liked the endamame spring roll. This was super cool. Try it with the hot sauce and you've got something awesome. I also liked the yellow curry. Can't remember the name, but it's their signature so they'll point you in the right direction. The firecracker sushi roll. I loved it. Gid thought it was a bit to spicy. We like heat so, if you don't like heat try something different or ask them to go light on the hot sauce because the roll itself is really well done. Hugs- M"}
{"text":"I was there for lunch. Decoration, atmosphere, everything awesome.  Food, ennn.. not good. I can tell from the menu it is an Asian fusion restaurant, not traditional. That is fine. But the food, itself, cold, mushy, salty. The food and sauce doesn't match."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. The inside is very beautiful and has a very modern feel. The pork dumplings and mango summer rolls were incredible. The pressed sushi was the best sushi I have ever had. The pho wasn't the typical authentic Vietnamese pho but it had a unique and great flavor. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Super slow service! Not a good place for a meal if you are on a schedule. Even at the bar.  Part of me loves CO and the other part finds it somewhat disappointing every time. The flavors the of the lemon pressed tuna with salmon are amazing but the sushi is difficult to eat, easily falling apart. I like the Pad Thai a lot but it's not amazing and costs more than other local places. We recently tried the chicken katzu banh mi and found it completely lacking in flavor, though the house hot sauce is delicious so that made it still worth eating. I keep giving CO more tries because I like the variety of menu items offered as well as the ambience. Some of the dishes and the service need improvement."}
{"text":"What I had:  Korean Short Rib Banh Mi and dumplings.  The items were takeout.  What I did not like:  The banh mi had too much meat and was soggy with too much sauce and unmemorable picked vegetables.  Normally too much meat isn't a problem, but proportions are an important thing for banh mi and these missed the mark.  There are only a handful of places to get banh mi in Charlotte, but I would not recommend here.  I also had the beef & kimchi dumplings and pork and ginger gyoza.  Both were overseasoned, but the gyoza was the beter of the two.  The beef and kimchi had an unbelievable amount of garlic which was not tasty.  I'll give the place another shot given that other menu items look really tasty, but on the banh mi and dumplings alone, I would pass."}
{"text":"CO is a newer place in the Park Road Shopping Center, specializing in Asian food of all sorts (Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, etc.).  We initially tried to go here on a Friday night but were turned away at the door after learning of the 1 hour wait.  I guess we underestimated the popularity of this spot.  We returned on Saturday for lunch and found it much easier, getting seated immediately.  As others have described, this place aims to serve up some traditional dishes in a very modern setting.  There are noodles of various sorts, pho, curry dishes, and sushi along with other Asian staples.  The setting is a definite plus, there's a cool bar in the middle with this crazy wood thing in the middle going from floor to ceiling that made me feel like I was sitting underneath a mushroom.    Our waitress was prompt and on the ball.  She answered our questions and checked up on us regularly.  We went with the summer rolls to start.  The waitress brought out some really tasty house-made sauce to go with everything.  It was nice and spicy, reminded me a bit of Sriracha.    For mains, we did some beef pho and pork ramen.  The pho was pretty good, but light on the beef.  The ramen was a little disappointing to me.  It has some really tasty pork belly, but once I got through that I wasn't left with much in the protein department.  The other minor disappointment was that the ramen was all stuck together.  I'm by no means a ramen connoisseur (although my college-self may disagree), but I don't want my noodles stuck together to where I can't eat them with chopsticks unless I hack them to pieces.   Ramen aside, it was all in all pretty good.  We'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"Delicious, simple pho - great for an introductory Vietnamese meal."}
{"text":"Yummy food with a lot of options. We have had sushi and Thai and both were great.  Caught a special on Tues and Thurs during happy hour timing and enjoyed a huge variety appetizers and sushi."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - the first time was a disaster with us having over an hour 'ticket time' but the food was so good I had to come back. I love the menu, especially that they have a lot of vegan choices. The only downfall is I feel like it is a bit overpriced compared to other restaurants carrying the same food."}
{"text":"Amazing food, so healthy and fresh. The service is so great here. I have had Nikki serve me a couple of times and I love her! I'll come back again and again."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the service is beyond terrible! We have gone three times and each experience has been worse. Today we were the only people dining and we had to keep asking for water etc. It seems that the restaurant never has any adults around just inexperienced wait and hostess staff."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars except for the glum, unwelcoming hostess. Bad day? Anyway, the service from Chris was fantastic, and the food excellent. The mango spring rolls and accompanying sauces are delicious, as well as the firecracker makimono (half price before 6:30). The tofu Banh Mi is also recommended (they have quite a few vegetarian/vegan offerings). The atmosphere is also SO much nicer than your typical Asian restaurant,"}
{"text":"Phenomenal .. I ate here for the first time a few nights ago. I ordered the Mango Summer Rolls and the Curry Laksa, both of which were fantastically flavourful. However, I do think they need to add more mango slices to the Mango Summer Rolls, after all they are called MANGO Summer Rolls. Regardless, the taste and textures were pleasing and I would most definitely order again.   The Curry Laksa was insanely good. So much that I could have possibly inhaled it a few times. Tasted fresh and extremely flavourful with a variety of smooth, complimentary notes. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is a definite 5 star location! Their pho and Vietnamese noodle dishes are amazing for any occasion. You get huge portions and a great selection of flavor and spice to add. Their pork belly buns are to die for! The manager is super caring and makes sure each table is having a good time and enjoying the experience. The wait staff is so friendly and helpful with selecting something new and daring on the menu."}
{"text":"CO is my default restaurant in CLT. I've tried a large portion of the menu. Everything I've ever had was amazing. My favorites are the Vietnamese Ramen, wings and Green Papaya Salad."}
{"text":"I have been to CO a couple of times now and the food never fails to impress. I am a fan of Asian Fusion food and that is what brings me here. The sushi, summer rolls, wings, com chai (fried rice), drunken noodles are all amazing. The hot sauce they provide on the table is actually quite hot so use with caution! the drinks are great and strong but a little pricy. I am taking one start away because there is no way to make a reservation on a busy Saturday night and the wait time is 30-45 minutes."}
{"text":"Wow !! Great service by Megan ! Very attentive and friendly -  Food is fabulous!! Pork dumplings."}
{"text":"Tried the new CO at Waverly Tuesday night.  The food was excellent, definitely recommend the small plates.  We had the beef and kimchi dumplings and the tuna poke, both were excellent.  We also shared the firecracker roll and the beef pho.  My wife liked the dark peach cocktail.  Our server was excellent, and bar service was excellent too.  Looking forward to returning this weekend to try more dishes."}
{"text":"What a cute date night place!  Came here on an impromptu date night with the husband and what a pleasant find.  It also happened to be restaurant week... Double score!  The decor is adorable with a cool wood structure in the center that looks like a futurist ice tree springing out of the bar.  I wasn't crazy about the height stools and tables(all raised) but definitely not a deal breaker.  I opted for the three courses restaurant week option which came with 2 cocktails.  My husband went for stand out items on the regular menu.  We tried three types of dumplings one of which was a part of my pre fixe.  The edamame dumplings were my FAVE.  The beef dumplings were my husbands fave( I wasn't crazy about the texture but they were tasty) The pork dumpling were just okay.  For the second course I had the chicken salad.  It was different and tasty but a one and done type of thing for me.  Next time I will try the spicy green papaya salad.  For main courses we opted for the Thai noodle dishes( yes it's Asian fusion). My husband had the drunken noodles which were very good.  They didn't use the traditional broad noodles but it was very tasty and the flavor was on point ( but if you like spicy, you may want to ask them to kick it up a notch). My pad Thai was DELICIOUS.  Very flavorful and the portion was pretty substantial.  I asked for some hot sauce ( I put that sh-t on everything) and I'm so glad I did.  To be clear the pad Thai did not need it as it was very tasty but I need spice in my life.  Their hot sauce is AMAZING!  I was tempt to ask for a bottle to buy and bring home but I refrained ( I mean it was date night and I truly didn't need 'hot sauce in my bag swag' but I'll be back for it)  All in all a great find and I will be back for the drinks and food"}
{"text":"Excelent place for a classic Vietnamese dish (beef pho). I went looking for a nice broth with noddles and it was delightful i also grab a couple of appetizers very nice presented and tasty. Totally recommended if you want to enjoy asian cuisine"}
{"text":"The crab rangoons were AMAZING. I know that sounds silly but these had something special to them and I can't describe what it was. It's too bad that special something didn't carry over to the drunken noodles. These were so disappointing. They were overlooked and dry, not to mention the chicken was nowhere to be found. Next time I have a crab Rangoon craving I will be sure to stop in but remember to order another entree."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but the seating is less than ideal.  We got the beef and kimchi dumplings (amazing); the yellow curry shrimp (the garlic toast w it was overpowering); the curry laksa (spicy, flavorful, really good); the ebi tempura sushi (very fresh!); and the wagyu roll (excellent, but I didn't think the beef added much of anything to it).  Service was good. We got there early on Friday and the place was basically empty, but by the time we left around 6:30 it was packed.  CAVEAT EMPTOR: this place is NOT large-size or handicap friendly. The tables are all either high-top, small backless stools, or bench-style seating like picnic tables. There is a SMALL section that is half booth/half hightop, and that's where we sat. Get there early or at a slow time if that's where you want to sit."}
{"text":"The crab Rangoon wontons are fantastic and my favorite dish is the green Thai coconut curry bowl. The service tends to be a little spotty, but Ashley's service was impeccable today.  There are more dishes I want to try and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm really a 3.5... When we first got there the waitress asked if we wanted anything else besides water (I got the cucumber mojito). The waitress was very nice and checked on us several times (we had a party of 8). The crab rangoon was pretty good, a bit small but the sauce on it was yummy! The dumplings were alright. There were four of them and they seemed to be pan fried. They were good, but definitely not anything special. For dinner I ordered the kobe jalepano roll. I have never had a bag sushi roll (knock on wood), but this was pretty good! You can definitely get a roll like this somewhere else for a little cheaper. But it was fresh and yummy!  The decor was nice and cozy. They had inside and outside seating."}
{"text":"Drunken Thai Noodles, Cambodia Roll, Pork Belly Buns.   This place is the best new restaurant in Charlotte by far.  Great ambiance.    Fun place for a weekend night.   HAVE to try the CO sauce (little spicy but great flavor)!!  Mimi is the best waitress we've had in a while!"}
{"text":"I was a little leery of trying CO after reading the reviews the last few months, but after my first visit, I'm cautiously optimistic that they've found their groove. A girlfriend and I got there around 6:20 on a Friday night; there was only a 15-20 minute wait! They took our number to text us when the table was ready, which was nice since you could shop around the shopping center if you needed to kill more time without fear of not hearing your name or a buzzer being out of reach. By 6:30, the waiting area was completely packed.  Our waiter, Elliott, was pretty much on point (except for having to remind him a few times that this nerd couldn't use chopsticks and needed a fork). We split a bottle of wine - all the bottles were priced between $30 and $38 - and started with the beef and kimchi dumplings ($5 for 4). They were fantastic. For dinner, my friend got the thai green curry ($14), which she said was really good but left a funky taste even after she got home and brushed her teeth, and I got the pork belly bahn mi ($9.50). I had read the other reviews that said there is A LOT of bread on the bahn mi, and you guys weren't lying. Once I got past the initial bite, I was okay, but I would've preferred more meat and less bread.  We split the bill evenly, and when it came, we both thought it was too low for what we'd gotten and had to double check it. For such a sassy, hip restaurant, we fully expected our bill to be more than $63 total.  The only reason I knocked off a star was ambiance/seating. We got lucky with a table on the other side of the waiting area wall, but there were about nine 2-top tables in front of it by the window that looked tight, with a couple of those tables being right in the waiting area. The seating is tight, but the music is so loud and the crowd so lively that you can't hear the conversations of the people next to you. Be prepared to yell a little though!"}
{"text":"As someone who gets sushi anytime and anywhere I can, when I tell you to get the Curry Laksa, get it. I can't believe I've never had it before and it was incredible.  Also tried the mango roll and the salmon carpaccio on the happy hour menu- salmon carpaccio was delicious.  For drinks, I had the Orange Blossom, very delicious and very pretty. Champagne, vodka, citrus-can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I tried Charlotte's CO for the first time today (we had been to the one at Myrtle Beach previously) and loved it! Part of that may have been because they had a special for 1/2 off sushi rolls for international sushi day. Otherwise it would have been a pricey lunch for three rolls. We tried the Tiger Roll, Pork Belly Roll and the Salmon and Avocado pressed sushi roll. They were all incredibly fresh and made with quality ingredients. We are avid sushi eaters and consider this to be great sushi for the 1/2 off price. With that being said, I'm not sure I would pay the full price for this sushi, particularly during lunch hours. The rolls range from about $10-$14 each which isn't extravagant but also isn't a great deal either. I think we would definitely enjoy this for dinner next time, I wouldn't mind paying that price for dinner.   Service was excellent, our waiter (I can't remember his name) was extremely helpful and accommodating. We will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes they have there."}
{"text":"I've been a little bit disappointed with the service at Co. The first visit the wait was bad so I tried it again as take out hoping that my experience would be better not frustrated from the pace of the waitstaff (they seem pretty inexperienced). The staff told me my Vietnamese Ramen and Pork Belly bun would be ready in 35min. I thought this was a bit long but hey at least I am within walking distance. When I arrived the hostess told me to follow her to the bar where she indicated my name to the staff member at the bar register...that girl ignored me :( and told me to wait just a minute when she did acknowledge me. So I waited and had to repeat my name to her and stand awkwardly at the bar for a few minutes. When I got home, 1min walk from restaurant, the bun was just cold and greasy, the pork just not seasoned.. The saving grace was the Vietnamese Ramen, which was good. The place just lacks a cohesive staff and has an awkward layout for staff mobility. Hoping all disappointment is a result from growing pains."}
{"text":"I got it for the first time yesterday and I'm already addicted. My chicken pad Thai was amazing. The portion was plentiful and the service was exceptional. I don't live in Charlotte but whenever I'm in town I will make it a point to go here. Everything was reasonably priced as well!"}
{"text":"A-OK is a very accurate description of my experience at CO. The interior is beautiful. It was a pleasure just being seated. The food was ok. The beef and kimchi dumplings were fine. The sauce that they brought was awesome though. The Vietnamese ramen was weird. I didn't much care for it. Our server was clearly new and a little awkward. Overall, for the price paid, I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I love CO! I'm Vietnamese so I'm love finding new Vietnamese restaurants to tryout. I really like the classy/modern interior of the place. Our server was really attentive and sweet as well. Once I saw that they have bubble tea on the menu I knew I just had to!! I ordered the mango bubble tea w/ boba. I was shook that I really enjoyed the bubble tea I honestly did not think I was going to like it that much but it was really good! They also added lychee jelly & that paired really well with the mango, but the tapioca balls were too hard and chewy. We also ordered the geisha sushi to share, and I had a pad Thai and my mom had the spicy udon. The sushi was okay good but my pad Thai was a bit too dry, I felt like if there was more sauce it would've been perfect! I also tried some of my mom's spicy udon and it was SOO good! Overall everything was good and I would totally come back to tryout their pho & banh mi. Way to go CO!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a few friends for a late dinner and drinks. First of all it was beautiful inside and the staff was very friendly. I split the blackberry sake and it was some of the best I have had. I also tried the pineapple which was good but a little too sweet for me. My rice bowl was bursting with flavor and the portion was huge! I will be back again!"}
{"text":"The service here is very friendly and helpful. I've eaten here a couple of times and enjoyed each meal. I've tried the yellow curry, the Vietnamese ramen, and the Kobe jalapeno roll. I liked them all, but enjoyed the curry the most. There's something about the curry sauce that makes me want to drink it straight! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends before catching a movie at the Park Terrace.   Love the lemongrass tofu dish!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and now I am so sad because it did not deliver! Sure the atmosphere makes you believe that you aren't in a strip mall, sure the wine list is actually decent, and sure the wait staff is inattentive enough to make you feel like the money you are spending is worth the culinary delight you are about to experience, but is it worth it? No. Last night, I waited at the bar for 40 minutes waiting for a single order of their Vietnamese Ramen. I live less than 5 mins away and so to get home and be disappointed by the food after such a ridiculous wait for RAMEN sucks. All of the ramen noodles were a congealed mass that you had to cut through. The pork belly served did have a good flavor, but for the price of the meal I expected more than 2 small squares of meat. Plus, the menu described the broth as this savory spicy treat and what I got was a buttery- leaning into bland- broth that had no spicy heat at all. I can't imagine Ramen to be that difficult to get right, so for it to be such a disappointment just makes me think how poor the rest of the menu must be. Great job on the interior of the restaurant! Hopefully those swanky, dimmed lights help hide the fact that your food is sub par. The only redeeming quality about this restaurant is the wine list."}
{"text":"Atmosphere here is really nice. This would be a great first date spot. The music isn't loud and ambiance is very relaxed but upscale. Their menu selection is huge and it was difficult to narrow down what we wanted to order because everything sounded good. My boyfriend went with his classic order: pad Thai and I ordered the pressed spicy tuna sushi and the firecracker sushi. While everything was delicious I would say the food we ordered was average. But I will be back to try out their drink menu and other entrees that caught my eye!"}
{"text":"I will highlight the environment here. It's really a good place for dating. The food is good too! I will come back for other dishes. Lots choices in here."}
{"text":"CO is amazing!  They blew me away with an excellent customer service experience a while back.   I was making Vietnamese food at home when I realize the PERFECT touch would be pickled carrots! I neither know how to make pickled carrots nor did I think I had the time. I called CO and asked if they'd be willing to sell me a side of them. I expected they'd say no to my random request but I figured I'd try anyways!   The woman who answered the phone was so friendly and asked me a ton of questions about what I was making to determine how big of a side I was looking for. She talked to the chef and they agreed to sell me a side portion.  When I showed up, they not only packed up a side of carrots, the chef had included two sauces he thought would go well with my dish. They even threw chop sticks and napkins in the bag. He was right, the sauces and carrots made my noodles and veg POP!   They made my day :-)   Additionally, their menu is fantastic. They have a separate vegan menu with tasty dishes like the edamame spring rolls, bun xao salad, spicy udon noodles, tofu bahn mi and more options I have yet to try. My mouth is watering typing about them.   My only complaint (which actually comes from my husband) is that some of the dishes are on the more oily side. I think he'd give CO a 4/5 review for that. But this is MY review and I give them a 5+  Oh and super cute ambiance and tasty drinks. I ordered a bourbon drink with muddled blueberries last time."}
{"text":"CO located in the Waverly area shopping center is a must try! The menu is comprised of all sort of Asian foods (Rangoons, Sushi, Ramen, Pho, and Vietnamese entrees). They have a large dinning area and a bar that seats about 8. The bar variety is limited but they do have a decent selection of cold and hot Sake drinks.   The Vietnamese ramen ($14) is amazing and they are one of the only ramen restaurants that I've tried that allow for meat substitution! If you liek your ramen spicy make sure to ask for their hot chili paste. Overall, great restaurant with tons of variety and flavor without breaking the bank, I would recommend for anyone who enjoys Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Great food but longer wait.   First off, the food is amazing. We had 3 apps and 1 sushi roll.  The spring roll was huge and the fish sauce dipping sauce was slightly spicy and tangy.  The tiger sushi roll was unbelievable.  We got the tofu buns, they were good, but small and probably won't get them next time.    That all took about 25-30 mins, not bad and we still had our yellow curry shrimp coming.  About 10 mins after we finished, our waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything else.  Told him no, just waiting on the shrimp.  Twenty minutes later, still no shrimp.  Called him back over and he said he would see what was wrong.   All and all it took 1.5 hours to get our last plate.  When it came out, it was by far the best thing we had all night.    Earlier in our meal the manager came to our table to the right and had to apologize for the long wait on 1 of the persons meal and ended up comping their entire meal.  After our food finally came out and we finished, the manager came over and comped our shrimp (which was nice, but didn't make up for the extra drinks over the hour when we were waiting).  When we were leaving, the manager came to the table to our left and had to cancel their meal b/c they were waiting 45 mins and no food.  Needless to say, the manager was running around comping food left and right.    Hopefully, they are just working out the kinks as many new restaurants do.  If not, they will not stay open long giving out so many free meals.  Will def go back, just not for a few months so they can smooth things out.  Great atmosphere, great food but 2 hours for 3 apps and a sushi roll is not ideal."}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant and the food is good, service decent. However when ordering takeout they NEVER get our order right and continue to charge us for their mistakes. Will look somewhere else for takeout from now on."}
{"text":"Great Asian restaurant in South Park area. Nice vibe, service, drinks, and food. The cucumber sake was great. We tried the Pho, Poke, ramen, udon and edamame spring rolls. All were delish! I told a few friends who live in the area to try it."}
{"text":"Great spot, great service, great food. Great prices. And some of the best boba tea with mango jelly I have ever had. A's all around"}
{"text":"Had dinner at CO for restaurant week. This was a really cool place. We went at about 7pm on Saturday, knowing they do not take reservations. Kind of annoying and don't understand it, but whatever. We waited an hour and a half for our food but it was worth the wait.   For the first course we tried the pork & ginger gyoza and the beef and kimchi dumplings. The beef and kimchi was ok but the pork was delicious. With the 1st course we also had the Sparkling Pineapple sake which was very good.  The second course we had the Vietnamese Chicken Salad and the Green Papaya Salad. Hands down the Papaya salad was amazing. Was so tasty and the flavors were just very intense.  For the 3rd course we had the Korean Rice Bowl and the Curry Laksa. I was so jealous that my husband ordered the curry. That was the best thing I have ever tasted. It was so rich and creamy. The Korean Rice Bowl was very lacking. Way too much rice and not enough meat. The flavors weren't that great either.  For dessert we had the cheesecake wontons and Strawberry Spring rolls. Both were great but the Vietnamese coffee with the Pecan Vodka was amazing. The coffee was so strong but amazing!  Overall I really liked this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both experiences have been good, but not great. The restaurant itself is beautiful. The decor, bar, furniture, plates, etc... are all impeccably designed and perfectly placed. The food is equally pleasing to the eye but the taste falls short on certain items.   During my first visit I started with the kimchi beef dumplings. The sauce that comes with dumplings are soupy, a little bland and just plain odd. Call me old-fashion but I'd like to control my sauce intake. I also prefer my dumplings pan-fried but didn't have that option for those.   I followed my dumplings with pho and unfortunately that was a big miss for me. The noodles were overcooked and the broth seemed like it was rushed because it lacked depth, flavor and attention.   On my second visit I came with two other people so I was able to split a few dishes. We split the curry laksa, drunken noodles and poke. The curry laksa wasn't bad but it lacked depth and some of the funk needed for a rich and delicious laksa broth. The drunken noodles were made with udon noodles, which made for an interesting twist. Overall the drunken noodles were a win in my book, which is something I can't say about the poke. The poke was way over-seasoned (too much soy sauce) and there was more crunchy stuff than actual poke. Overall, I'm not going to rush back here but the coolness factor and the curiosity of others will probably land me back here in a few months."}
{"text":"Oh Co, I was so excited for you to open. We tried to give a good amount of time to work out kinks before trying this new restaurant in waverly. We arrived for dinner on a Friday night and the dining room was full of large parties with tons of children screaming and running around. My friend was actually seated next to one of these parties in a large booth and she told me at one point one of the toddlers was standing on the booth with its pants down. I think the location next to the water play area is not awesome. Additionally, the entrance to the restaurant is awkward, it feels like the main door shouldn't be the main door. We walked up to the hostess and put in our name for an inside table because it was a bit chilly for outside. We waited around 30 minutes and went to check on our table. Miraculously we had chosen the perfect timing and we were seated then. This restaurant was severely under staffed. There were 2 waiters trying to serve the entire dining room AND bussing their own tables. So dirty tables were sitting around because these poor people are so busy. All while there are 2 hostesses whose waiting system is only writing names and phone numbers on a piece of paper.    We are greeted right away but didn't have any time to look at the drink menu. Our waitress is occupied dealing with the complaints of the table sitting next to us. This table actually took out their phone lights when they lowered the lighting around 8 (what the heck people). We finally put in our drink orders and then we are left alone for probably 25-30 minutes without putting in our food order. Finally our cocktails come, my husband got the wrong drink but it tasted good and we weren't about to wait for another. We finally get to put in our food orders, dumplings, ramen, and the Korean bowl. The food came out quickly and it was pretty good. The dumplings didn't taste super fresh, the ramen was good and hubby loved his bowl. The rest of the evening went much more smoothly.  The restaurant needs to adopt a hostess software, hire a busser, have another waiter, and I'm not sure how to deal with rambunctious children taking up seats for hours. I'll probably come back and try again, the ramen really did warm my soul."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here. The first time I came I had a wonderful experience. I ordered the curry laksa and it was flavorful with lots of noodles, chicken, and shrimp. The second time however, I took my mom here and she ordered the Vietnamese ramen which was pork based. Nowhere did it say that there were any beef in there. When her ramen came out all that was in there was beef and no pork. We told our waiter this and he was making some excuse with that's how the cook prepared it and he didn't change it. Also I ordered the curry laksa again and this time there were barely any noodles with little shredded chicken. I'm not sure what happened this time around."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed it! We had the pork belly buns for appetizer.  The spicy pho was served with cilantro (I am used to getting it with Thai basil).  The beef in it was great!  My wife had the Korean rice bowl.  It reminded us of food we had on LA.  Our server Anna was attentive and the food came out promptly.  Prices range between $12-15 for many entrees. Very reasonable. We tried the lychee infused sake which was a bit sweet for my taste.  We'll go there again!"}
{"text":"Their papaya salad is amazing!  I love that they put red roasted pork in that dish.  My friends were also very happy with their Pad Thai dish as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome....wings, dumplings...everything really."}
{"text":"The summer roll noodles need to be soft, ours was very hard. The Bún bò Hu soup was too salty, but the dumplings,sushi, and Vietnamese ramen was good. I would definitely come back, but order something else."}
{"text":"The place is well decorated, warm & friendly ... Food was excellent -- but if you have an allergy WATCH THE MENU carefully! My adult son has a peanut & tree nut allergy, and we didn't notice the little red peanut symbol next to the Spicy Beef Pho he ordered. He had an allergic reaction about 30 minutes after we left, and we had to dose him up with Benadryl. Thankfully, he's fine, but we had NO IDEA that anything he ingested had peanuts in it. I do wish the menu was more blatant about things that contain peanuts -- it was not listed in the description of the item, just had a little red peanut symbol next to it. Our server was lackluster, but the person who brought us our food was great. I will definitely go back but will watch the menu more carefully."}
{"text":"Much more casual than I expected - there is a large bar in the center of the restaurant.  Everything I had was good including the spring rolls, pork belly buns and their version of a spicy tuna sushi roll.  They have a small sushi list but all looked very good.   FYI..small beer list.  better place for cocktails than beer"}
{"text":"So, I hadn't heard good things from this place from my friends, but I decided to take the plunge and try it (for lunch mind you... I'm a dip my toe in the pool before I jump all in kind of guy).   The space is very cool and modern. The middle of the bar has this wooden-tree like structure that's nice. The service was decent.   To start, I felt the prices were a little high for what it was. Vietnamese food is relatively inexpensive in authentic places, but this is fusion... and we're in Southpark... so there you go. I'm not paying $9 for a Bahn Mi sandwich... not my thing. Sushi was also a little pricey, but they looked good coming out of the kitchen. I asked the server for a recommendation: he mentioned the curry laksa. It wasn't bad... the curry was a little too sweet, but I'm guessing that part of the 'fusion' they are talking about. The bowl was nice size and the noodles were cooked well. Overall I liked the dish. I felt that I need to try a couple of more dishes before I give it my final opinion, so ultimately I would go back again."}
{"text":"CO has a great menu that is just the right size. Delicious selections with just enough choices to where it isn't overwhelming. The atmosphere is super cool, with a simple but beautiful interior. The drink options are also amazing as they have great alcoholic options as well as fruit juices and boba teas."}
{"text":"At this point, I've been to CO about four times, and have now tried a good chunk of the menu.  I have yet to find something I don't like.  Let's start with the starters.  Pork dumplings were pretty decent and the edamame was good.  If you're looking for a safe bet, these are the way to go.  If you're looking to jump a little outside the box, try the short rib bahn mi.  Great flavors and sauce!  Now let's transition into the Sushi.  I had a wagu rool that had cream cheese in it...sounds weird, but it works.  I've tried a few other rolls with salmon and tuna...all are incredibly FRESH (not fishy) and the rice/seaweed was not chewy like it's been sitting out for a while waiting to be turned into a roll.  I hope you've saved room for noodles.  Drunken noodles and pad thai are pretty solid.  Thai Basil was ok.  Big winner was the Vietnamese Ramen.  So much flavor in that little bowl, it was unbelievable!  Included are two pieces of pork belly...a nice added touch.  It's a fun place to get dinner.  They have a cute outdoor space, so I can see this being a popular spot to hang out during the summer.  Drinks are pretty good and the service is decent, but you come here for the food and the ambiance.  Great vibe!"}
{"text":"After the experience I had this evening, I won't be returning to this restaurant.  I have a child that has issues with eating.  The restaurant offers an Asian-inspired kids menu.  Nothing on the kids menu works for him, so we brought food from a place across the street.  During our meal, the asst. manager came over and informed us that outside food is not allowed because the owner deems it is \"bad for business\".  He asked us to at least take his food out of the container and put it on a plate.  I said ok - if they will be so kind as to bring us a plate.  I was shocked.  I got more and more upset as the meal went on.  Our child is 8, and we've been bringing food for him into restaurants in some form for 8 years.  It's the only way our family can enjoy dinner out.  We have only been met with a smile each time, until tonight.  I just paid over $50 to be insulted and upset.  I even spoke to the asst. manager to share my feeling before we left.  He shared it was unfortunate that we won't be able to come back as a family with food for my son. He reiterated that the owner finds outside food (even for kids) \"bad for business\".  I share this personal review because I feel that treating your customers poorly is \"bad for business\".  I was embarrassed and hurt.  No one should feel that way for a dinner that you pay for in what claims to be a nice restaurant.  So disappointed, CO."}
{"text":"Love love love the menu, the atmosphere and the service. We tried first in Savannah and loved it. We loved Charlotte just the same. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really really want to love this place. The menu is amazing and has something for everyone;And it is convenient they have gluten and vegan friendly menus upon request.    Service is the main concern. Maybe it is growing pains, but the service is BEYOND terrible. The servers are running around, so maybe there aren't enough of them, but the service is slow slow slow. It took us 20 minutes to get out wine, which was just left on our table, un poured with Champagne glasses (instead of wine glasses. )  we also received our apps AFTER our food had arrived. And the soup I ordered was cold. cold.   Skip the sushi, it is overpriced and not creative or decent at all-stick to the small plates and noodle dishes. I know the soup bowels looks good, but they come out cold, and WAY to spicy to consume.   The dumplings are amazing, as are the spring rolls and the sauce is wonderful that they pair with them.  Drunken noodles and pad thai are very good, large portion, and they both have a bit of a spicy kick to them.   They dont do take out- wish they did!"}
{"text":"omg. I just had pad thai here at noon, put half in a box for later, and am ALREADY finishing it at 2! *insert cry face here* It's so delicious. Pretty empty at early lunchtime on a Thursday, so perfect for going and getting your food right away. Very yummy! It would be five stars if it was cheaper."}
{"text":"I am completely obsessed with this place. FINALLY, a place that captures the essence of cool. Being from NY, super hard to find food, atmosphere and awesome music with an urban vibe in Charlotte, but this place nails it! Oh and the food is amazing AND you can eat healthy out. Besides having my favorite wine by the glass, love the Miso Ramen, yum! Great place to bring visitors from out of town. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time here...fantastic! Ambiance is great, exposed brick wall, bar in the center with a difficult to explain, so you gotta see it, \"slat\" tree that extends over the restaurant, absolutely beautiful. My friend and I shared the Tofu summer rolls, so delicious! I had the curry laksa and my friend had the miso ramen. Both were wonderful! Saw gorgeous sushi going to other tables, will definitely try that next. Service was also incredible, and the host at the front was very sweet, even stopping by our table later to see how we liked it. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I had the avocado ceviche, makes you wanna slap your mama. Drunken noodles were pretty good, I've had better but these were still yummy.  Customer service not so much...I will say the joint was jumping though, 6:30 on a Wednesday evening and there is a thirty minute wait for a table. I opted for the bar. Bar stools too close together, my hips had issues and no elbow room. After almost 10 minutes I had to request a menu. I didn't know they participated in restaurant week because I wasn't given that menu option.  Not the spot for big groups, the largest tables sit only 4 people.  I"}
{"text":"Second Trip to this Modern Asian Fusion place in the last three weeks! Truly Outstanding!. I have seen it packed,  as it was tonight,   ( Sat. Nite ) and empty on a late lunch day 3 weeks ago. Both times I have had great service and delicious food.  Starting out,  its ultra modern with a gorgeous Wooden tree in the middle of the bar. Speaking of the bar..Outstanding Mixologist there. ..they muddle fresh fruit into sake and alcohol and even non alcoholic sparkling drinks. I have had the blackberries with  lychee and sake  and also the Cucumber mint and ginger drink. Refreshing and delcious! I have now had the Banh Mi Sandwich twice - first time it was the Caramel Pork and tonight it was the Pork Belly. The best I have had in Charlotte and I have been here 12 years!  Crispy fresh bun with sweet cucumber and hot pepper slices and a  great sauce! Tried the fried Rice tonight and it was a nice size helping with fresh tomato and peas and fresh cilantro --loved it. My sister is a vegetarian and they had a vegan and also a Gluten free menu. She had Spring Egg rolls with lemongrass. They were great. We also tried the Green Papaya Salad...that was crisp and fresh and authentic ! It is in the Old  ( Newly Remodeled) Park Road Shopping Center...Don't miss this place..You will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"The vibe of this place is awesome. Big city trendy meets low key local. We were seated right away, and our server (Yu-nais) was awesome. Our food came out really quick and our hungry bellies were more than satisfied.   We ordered the beef and kimchi dumplings as an appetizer. They were a perfect mix of spices to make them spicy, but still tasty. I'm not a huge fan of things being spicy just to be spicy, so these were great. We shared them and both wished we had gotten our own. My husband even drank the rest of the sauce with a spoon!  I ordered the spring geisha sushi roll. It was light and fresh and actually stuck together when trying to eat it with chopsticks. I appreciate that in sushi.   My husband ordered the spicy udon. This was very spicy, but still also had good flavor. The wok noodles had such an interesting texture (in a good way). There were a good amount of vegetables and chicken in it too. He was extremely impressed throughout the meal, he also blew his nose multiple times. It was really spicy. There was also this other sauce that they bring to the table that he added into it. He loved it so much that he got a small container of it to go!   Overall we loved CO. The atmosphere is fun and the food was really good, each dish tasted very different from the other. My only complaint would be that we ran out of water a few times and the water had to be taken to the back to be refilled. This was hard when you're eating spicy food and need water right away haha. Other than that, it was great and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Co and had a very nice experience.  We started with the beef and kimchi dumplings which were great and more filling than we had anticipated.  We then had the pork belly roll and it was outstanding!  The service as very good.  Be sure to try the Saigon hot sauce, it is stand out.  They do sell it btw."}
{"text":"Toi vui! Vietnamese for \"I am happy,\" because that's exactly how I feel.  CO, I don't know if it was the hot sake, exceptional sushi, modern atmosphere or the prompt service but everything was outstanding and here's why:   I am in no way a sake connoisseur but that was some of the best hot sake I've had. The moment it touched my lips I said, Toi thich (I like).   We enjoyed a bottle before we ordered our sushi and it was so tasty that we ordered another. I highly recommend but why must it come in such small cups! Kidding, its a culture thing - I know, I know...   Now for the sushi - It was banging!  We ordered the Firecracker, Obi Tempura, Kung Fu Crunch and as Scotty P might say, I had no ragrets.  The Obi Tempura was my favorite; I now know why Obi- Wan Kenobi once said, \"the Force is great with this one,\" he was speaking about CO!  While only splitting three rolls, we were stuffed and Toi met (I was tired).    The atmosphere made us feel like we were in a modern, trendy bar as it gives off so much energy yet makes you feel relaxed.    And let's not forget about the service, well done.  Always checking in but not in the annoying mother-in-law way. The waitress was constantly refilling our water glasses and most importantly she asked us if we needed more sake. I did not catch the waitresses name but Xin Cam on (Thank you)!   Overall CO,  I shall be back!  This place is great for a happy hour, birthday celebration or a date spot. I can't wait for my next experience and once again, Xin Cam on!"}
{"text":"Great Asian restaurant, the atmosphere is beyond standard, the food is so so, and I would come back for the experience. Their focus is more on the noodles than anything else, and I do like their Hanoi Noodle. Their service is good, and host is friendly. I would recommend people to try for the experience."}
{"text":"I have been so excited to try this restaurant and I was seriously disappointed in the service we were provided. First and foremost, the food was great. Everything we ate tasted awesome, but the service was the worse we have ever had. We ordered 3 courses off of the restaurant week menu, and it took us 1 full hour to be served the first course.  We ended up taking our entrees to go because it was taking so long for everything to come out We ate 2 of 3 courses in the restaurant and were there for 2 hours. The fastest thing to be brought to is was the check,  Our drinks were never refilled and it took 30 minutes to get a beer.  If you love Asian food and spending hours in a restaurant with no food or refreshments, go here. If you like efficient and attentive service go elsewhere. It's too expensive to be treated poorly as a guest."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed myself here on April 27 with my girlfriend. We had a much need girls night as she came to town for a visit.  We started the night off at two different CO locations lol. Very confusing, I was at the Providence location and she was here at the Providence location. After driving to meet her at the park road location I was so pleased. As soon as I walked in the first thing I saw was the beautiful wooden tree and the 95.5 food score. The Providence location...not so much...I wrote a review about my 15minutes at the Providence location. Not very happy with the Providence location.  When I arrived I felt super bad that my bestie was still waiting on me but we laughed and made the best of it. I wasn't too fond of our server, but I ignored his horrible sarcasm remarks. I was just thrilled to see and spend time with my friend. We started our order with a glass of wine and an appetizer.   Food $5.00 for 4 Crab Rangoon's were AMAZING and a must order when you're here. They were not hard at all and filled with lots of crab. The Rangoon's were so good I walked politely over to the chefs and asked who made them. I hate that I forgot their names, but I did however capture a photo of them. Compliments to the CHEFS on these rangoons! I had to personally thank them, and thankfully in this restaurant, the chefs are in an area that you're able to speak directly to them. $12 EBI TEMPURA shrimp, avocado, cucumber, yamagobo, spicy aioli, unagi sauce this roll was really great I really enjoyed it and it's 8 pieces and the presentation was great.  $12 CATERPILLAR unagi, cucumber, yamagobo, topped with avocado, unagi sauce this was a traditional caterpillar roll.  $13 RAINBOW salmon, tuna, unagi, yellow tail, surimi salad, avocado my friend ordered this roll, she LOVED IT! $14 KUNG FU CRUNCH salmon, avocado, cream cheese, topped with spicy tuna, unagi sauce, spicy aioli, tempura flakes she also ordered this one, but we both didn't like all the cream cheese it was very overpowering.   And for dessert she made me try the $5 STRAWBERRY SPRING ROLLS nutella dipping sauce. These were INSANELY delicious but extremely. We both were quite disappointed in the server not informing us that the rolls were fresh out of the fryer. We both burned our mouth and shared this with him, his response... Oh sorry about that I probably should have told you.   Despite the horrible server, our experience was great because we were happy to have a girls night. The Chefs were awesome, I just wish the server had the same attitude."}
{"text":"Although I did not eat at this restaurant, the time that I spent there is the reason for my review. I was super excited about going to CO for dinner with my best friend on Friday. When I arrived, I really liked that the restaurant was adjacent to the play area. It was a little different entering the restaurant though, the front entrance door was on the patio so I was a little confused. Walking I immediately began looking for my friend because she mentioned she had just arrived at the restaurant. When I didn't see her I walked to the host desk to see if she may have made a reservation. The host wasn't friendly at all with assisting with my table as my friend had not exactly arrived. Then I immediately noticed the horrible food score 92.0 and the date on the scorecard was April 25, 2018. If this was a new restaurant, that's not good at all!  We walked over to the available table and I began snapping photos and checking out the space. Then when my friend called, we realized she was at the Park Road location and I was at the Providence location. I was honestly releaved and willing to make the drive to join her at that location. I don't think I could have truly stomached the 92.0 food score, a few of the reviews I read beam to be true about this location. If you would like to try CO i would suggest the Park Road location it wa great and the amazing bar tree is beautiful."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't try this place before because it's amazing. The noodles dishes are so good with high quality meat and large shrimp. The ambience seems really bougie so I was skeptical they would have good Asian food, but I was so wrong. The Hanoi noodles even have Asian sausage."}
{"text":"Awesome new place in park road shopping center amazing interior design, looks like Vegas and yummy Asian and vegan inspired food choices. Service was great. Food was excellent. I ordered the pho! By the way they do have their liquor license now."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great service, cool atmosphere and delicious food and cocktails. We got the spinach and water chestnut dumplings, pork belly sushi and curry laksa. Do it. And get the blackberry bourbon fizz and jalapeno guava marg. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"I ate here the other day with my sister and niece. We are part Vietnamese and are used to eating authentic Vietnamese food cooked by my mom, but were interested to try Vietnamese fusion. I had the curry (Lanska?) which was delicious, my sister had the com chien, also very good, but my niece had the Ramen noodles which tasted too eggy with not enough flavor. I also had the Thai boba tea which was decent, but not the best I've had. I will definitely return to try their other dishes. We were there for an early dinner so there were few people and service was decent, though it took longer than we expected for our food to come out."}
{"text":"CO is one of my favorite solo spots. Every time I've come the staff is friendly and professional. I haven't come when they were super busy but the service is prompt and the food always comes out hot and fresh. The menu is extensive enough to make choosing difficult but in a good way. Everything sounds amazing. I say sounds since I tend to stick to the Ahi Poke (my original reason for hitting it up) and their crab wontons are the best I've ever had. I also really appreciate the music they play, especially since I'm usually alone. I even heard a Miniature Tigers song once! Maybe next time I can talk myself into trying something new since I'm convinced anything I ordered would be fantastic. I've been a handful of times and have no complaints whatsoever. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place has been open 2 years and this was my first time trying it! We sat at the bar since the only tables left we're for 8 (but good to know next time I have a group). Garrett was our bartender and he was very attentive and easy to chat with without being overly chatty. He'd been there just over two years and knew a lot about the menu. We took pretty much all of his recommendations!  Drinks: I had the Orange Blossom, which at first was a little bitter for my taste, but Garrett heard me and was nice enough to add a little more champagne to even it out.   Food: started with the spicy crab ragoon dumpling and YUM! Next came out our two rolls of sushi to share: the FIJI Salmon and Tuna Tataki. The salmon was rice-free and very fresh. The tuna was excellent as well and a great combo of flavors. We also later added a lemon roll which was very refreshing but definitely different. You have to like lemon a lot. We also ordered the curry shrimp from the small plate part of the menu. It took a long time to come out and Garrett noticed and checked. It came out not long after that but the bread was soggy. Garrett noticed and put in an order for new bread for us, which was much crispier.   The food was pretty great and Garrett was freaking awesome for looking out for us. The only thing I would change is just making sure every item served is top quality."}
{"text":"Ok first of all, the food is good.  First time eating there -  Make sure they repeat back to you what you order.  My Dad order the Beef Pho ($12) and I got the Korean Bowl ($12).   The Pho, he said he wasn't a fan of the noodles, he ate most of it.  My Korean bowl was very good, and then we had the Cheesecake wontons, very good.  When I got the check they had charged me for a boba tea (we did not order or get) we were charged for Vietnamese Ramen ($14) which didn't make since we didn't order, and the Korean bowl and cheesecake wontons.  They took the boba tea off and argued that we did order the Vietnamese Ramen so we paid for it I gave her $40 for our check that was $33.45, which the change would be $6.55, the bartender/waitress said would you like any change and I said yes $2.00, and she said your change is just $4 and I was tired of arguing so I said, fine keep the change...   I might go back because I loved the food, but I would ask them to repeat the order before they put the order in and also, double check the ticket and also not tip that much for the two big mistakes they made (very disappointed)"}
{"text":"It's new, so things are still uneven. On 2 separate visits the broth soup was served lukewarm. When they do it over, its scrumptious. Tofu Bahn mi is delicious - although id like to try it with UNFried bread. Pressed sushi is flavorful and sized well enough to fit in mouth gracefully. Jasmine Tea temperature  was tepid. Our bearded server clearly doesn't like to serve. I think once they iron out the new restaurant kinks, this will be phenom."}
{"text":"Went for a lunch on a nice Saturday afternoon. The place wasn't that full. Ordered a veggie bowl with tofu and pad Thai. The pad Thai was really good. Do give it a try. Love their bar side area."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try his place out for a while. Every time I tried to there was an hour or more wait and they don't take reservations. I almost gave up when I called to try and make a reservation and the young girl who picked up said \"hi\". That was it. No intro of the restaurant or how can I help you. However, I gave CO the benefit of being a new restaurant and decided to attempt to dine there tonight. The atmosphere reminded me a lot of a swanky/hip NY/LA style restaurant. I really liked the center bar and communal tables. My friend and I started with gyoza and summer rolls. Both were tasty. I liked the gyoza more then the summer roll. I ordered a lychee iced tea (was not happy that they charge for refills) but it was tasty if you just wanted one. My friend got friend rice and I got a coconut soup that was highly recommended. It was delicious! I want to come back and try their sushi next time. I just hope the next time I call to see how long the wait is I get a proper greeting."}
{"text":"Cool, funky place located in The Park Road shopping center. Excellent service, friendly employees. I ordered the Pad Thai with the chicken and shrimp. Too many noodles and not enough shrimp and chicken for me. There were A LOT of noodles. I couldn't finish my bowl. Not sure why, but within an hour of leaving I had terrible stomach pains and had to find a bathroom (sorry, gross). I may return and try another dish. We shall see.  Updating this review because after my initial one, someone named Jonah from Co commented on my review stating \"I'm glad you enjoyed your meal...\" I'm guessing he didn't actually READ my review. Odd response."}
{"text":"This place is way to nice for its location! Service was great, cucumber martini  was good.. could have been a little stronger for my liking.. the Goyza had great flavor!! The Masa ramen  definitely hit the spot!! Worth the 30 minute drive!"}
{"text":"I was truly blown away with this restaurant! I'm not a big cocktail drinker but their options sounds so delicious and I wasn't let down. The service was really great at the bar. When my group got moved to a table (and they got way busier) our server got a little distant but other employees were there to assist with our needs. Most importantly is the food. My mom is from Thailand so I am really picky when it comes to Asian cuisine but I was really blown away! Everything was delicious. We had dumplings, pork belly sushi, spicy tune sushi and spring rolls. Definitely making ourselves a regular here. Also, the manager said they were starting a delivery service in a month or so which is even better!"}
{"text":"Decor is nice and modern. The establishment is clean and has outdoor seating. I ordered an app and pad thai which were both flavorful. The portion is enough for lunch and dinner! Sasha was very patient and helpful with describing the menu and providing recommendations."}
{"text":"I really love pho and bahn mi. The Park Road Shopping Center is a great location. However, this place is a dud. I had a sandwich which was completely unremarkable, it was assembled in a kitchen. It was not made with any speciality. It was like a Subway sandwich but super fussy and expensive.   Fussy is a word I would use to describe CO in general. A lot of effort went into the aesthetic but it felt cramped and sterile (how?). I sat in the front of the dining area at a two top. The idea of communal tables is lovely, if this was the case I would have felt less cramped. But our postage stamp of a table was far too close to my neighbor's postage stamp of a table. It was impossible to not to get my neighbors far flung pho on me a little bit.   I was also not super impressed with the service. Weekday lunch after one and our waiter must have had a hard shift cause was MIA most of the meal.   There are some really, really, really good spots for both bahn mi and pho all over Charlotte, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely spectacular.  Went here for dinner, first time ever, and as vegan I was pleased to see they had a menu just for us.  I ordered the crispy vegetable roll which is absolutely AMAZING.  And the Korean hot sauce they serve with the appetizers is too good.  I also had their edamame spring rolls--again mind blowingly delicious.  The atmosphere was lively for a Saturday night so you'll want to get there early.  (There was a 45-minute wait but luckily my friend had connections-lol).    Everything from the service to the food to the ambience was great.  Even met a couple new friends while there so any time a restaurant can bring strangers together over good food, I'm all for it.    You MUST check this place out!"}
{"text":"New place I had to try. I'm a lover of Pho so naturally I had to try the Curry Laksa. Very flavorful dish. Large portion sizes, I had to take a togo box. I also tried mango summer rolls and the sake. All was great, really loved the sake infusion."}
{"text":"Curry Laksa came out lukewarm and way too salty, if you know anything about Asian noodle soup, the broth should always be sizzling hot! That's why the bean spouts, basil and cilantro are put on the side to be \"blanched\" on your own. With that said the Hanoi noodles were good, my husband liked this place for the cool atmosphere and interesting cocktails, mainly for its proximity to our house. As a sucker for authentic Asian cuisine I'm not a fan of paying $15 for a bowl of salty lukewarm noodle soup that I could get elsewhere for $9 and much better prepared."}
{"text":"We had a good experience here. Brought my parent here to try this place knowing they can appreciate some Vietnamese foods. I'm not going to lie, I was a little nervous bringing them here because they are normally pretty critical when it comes to eating out and especially at a restaurant not owned by a Vietnamese person attempting to specialized in Asian cuisines. To my surprises, they actually really enjoyed their Pho orders! That is saying a lot! They normally aren't accepting of all the Pho broths around town but actually approved of this place impressed me. Although the Pho broth was yummy, the portions weren't much and the parent were left a little hungry still. Oh! That Singapore sauce is so so good though!  I got the Bun Bo Hue and to my surprise, the flavor WAS ON POINT! Now, I can't say the same about the meat tenderness nor noodles however, I'm quite shocked the broth was perfect. It was extremely, extremely spicy making it a little overwhelming to finish (and I normally can handle a little heat!).  Even my parent said it was way too spicy!  On the downside, the meats & noodles for the Bun Bo Hue were undercooked, making it hard to chew & eat. Definitely needs some improvements on that.   Btw, be prepared to come and wait. We ended up walking around the shopping center to kill time while waiting for our table. The setting was nice, clean and modern but has a cold feel to it. Restaurant doesn't exude that warm & inviting feel when you walk in...felt like a little warehouse and kind of out of place decors & seating arrangements.  A little overpriced in my opinion for most meals. I mean, I can find a cheaper bowl of bun bo hue or pho at Doan's or Saigon Palace (nearby Vietnamese restaurants) for $8-10 whereas you're paying $12-14 bucks here for the \"hip & trendy\" atmosphere really."}
{"text":"We had varied experience at CO. The ambiance of the place was lively. The drinks and bar were respectable. The staff and service were great. The food not so much. For appetizers we had the recommended Curry Shrimp which although a huge portion, not very tasty. The beef and kimchi dumplings too were bland. For the main course we had the Curry Laska and the Spicy Udon. The Curry Laska was the exact same Curry as the shrimp Curry, plus some more bland additions. The  Udon noodles were full of onions and scallions barely enough sauce or meats. Since the place is still new, I'm willing to give it another try in a few months."}
{"text":"Just finished an outstanding lunch here. Some of the best spring rolls we've had. Our waiter was excellent, providing good suggestions to us and prompt thoughtful service. Entrées had complex flavors without being overwhelming. variety of spiciness choices. Huge portions. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I placed a take out order on 2/18 at 6:10 pm and was told it would be ready in 30 minutes--6:40. I had 8 items, 5 appetizers and 3 entrees--had family in town and meeting at my daughters house. I arrived about 6:35 to pick it up.  Hostess rang it up and said it would just be a few minutes.  The restaurant was starting to fill up and at least 4 other people came in to pick up take out orders which were ready.  I was still waiting and the hostess kept telling me just a few more minutes. Finally at 6:55 the manager came out and said the kitchen was backed up and it would be another 15 minutes.  They were still 5 orders ahead of mine.  I was not happy with that considering it had already been 45 minutes since I placed the phone order.  I saw people in the restaurant that were seated while I was there who were getting their food orders.  Some patrons walked out because their server told them it would be at least 45 minutes before they could get any food. However, the hostess did not share this with anyone that came in.  The manager was very apologetic and said they had stopped taking take out orders.  I finally received my order at 7:25--1 hour and 15 minutes after placing it-- totally unacceptable and no offer of compensation for the long wait.   Fortunately the food was good (except the chicken on the poke bowl was dry).  This is restaurant that is very near my house and used to be a favorite but something needs to be done about the service.  This was the second time I placed a take out order that took longer than promised."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great service and delicious food. I had the rare beef pho soup and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The poke bowl is AMAZING! The service is great! We ordered two bowls and we just loved every bite.  The decor is beautiful and the food is just ro die for!"}
{"text":"Co still has a few kinks to work out but all in all, we enjoyed our meal and service. We started with the pork gyoza... They took almost 40 minutes to come out and when they finally made it to the table were ice cold. Our waiter redeemed the situation to the best of his ability, apologizing for the delay, explaining the kitchen was backed up, etc. Our mains came out quickly after the appetizer, thank goodness.   We shared the pressed spicy tuna sushi and green papaya salad. The sushi was slightly overpriced IMO but good -- not the best I've ever had but flavorful and fresh. The salad was the surprising winner of the night! The crunchy texture and vibrant flavors all really combined well for a solid dish and reasonably priced at $11. I'll be back over and over again for this one!   Knowing we were on a time crunch (trying to make a movie at the theatre across the shopping center), our waiter brought our check with our entree which was appreciated. He even made some pleasant small talk about what we were seeing and other films showing. I wish I could remember his name because he really made the night for us."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Co during restaurant week. I was very impressed with the menu. The food was delicious. Definitely in my Top 10 places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me restaurants in NYC or LA. Very trendy. The food here is actually pretty good. I really enjoy the infused sake's they have the menu definitely worth a try! Also check out the ramen dishes they are good."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting CO. I would highly recommend visiting during Happy Hour! I'm in LOVE!!!!!!!!!! I've had this place bookmarked on my Yelp list.   Let's begin with the staff! Special shout out to Chandler! She's one of the BEST bartenders!! Her menu suggestions are delightful!   My Food and beverages this evening: Happy Hour means Half off Sake Carafe! I ordered the Blackberry Carafe  Food: (One) Pork & Shrimp Spring Roll! I should've ordered two!!!! But hey! It was $3 so why not!!   (Happy Hour Sushi) half off before 6:30 at the bar only! I had the California & Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll with a side of spicy mayo! So yummy!!! Best sushi ever!!   The Malaysian chili wings are EVERYTHING!!!!! This was my second time ordering them!! I got these To-Go for my husband.   Dessert!! Thanks for The Yelp check in offer, I had the strawberry spring rolls!! Ohhh my Lord!!! I'm going to dream about these tonight   I definitely look forward to coming here again soon!! I really want to try their Pho/Ramen! Until next time!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites for Asian fusion in Charlotte. Great vibe, awesome service, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Today was my first and probably last visit to this place. To start, I went to the ladies room before being seated for lunch. While standing at the sink in the bathroom, I watched a waitress walk right out of a stall and back out into the restaurant without even thinking of washing her hands. I'm no germaphobe, but that sincerely grossed me out. Because of that, we opted to sit at the bar with hopes that the bartender washed his hands. The service we received at the bar was really great and they had a great selection of drinks and food, but the beef pho was awful. I didn't even want to finish it because the flavor was so off-putting. The broth had a metallic taste, almost as if it had been stored in a metal container too long. The beef tasted old and was very gamey which turned me off to the dish entirely. I really love pho and Asian fusion. I'm sad we didn't have a better experience."}
{"text":"Update: Wait a few months before trying any new restaurant. After going to CO in Ballantyne for a Yelp event and having really good sushi and curry, I came back to the Park Road location and knew exactly what to order. Much better experience. We tried 4 different rolls, 1) pressed spicy tuna, 2) lemon, 3) Cambodian, and 4) Fiji. Would definitely come back for the pressed spicy tuna and lemon. I tried the curry laksa at the yelp event and it was so good that I need to come back and try a whole bowl to myself."}
{"text":"The curry Losca and wings are phenomenal. This has to be one of the most flavorful dishes in Charlotte North Carolina. I highly recommend this dish and restaurant. They are very nice and accommodating as well."}
{"text":"Know what you're getting before you come here. We went to Co in Charleston a year ago so we were excited to see one open in Charlotte. It was ehhh - food was super salty and the menu doesn't do the best job of actually describing the dishes (i.e. the lemongrass curry was so disappointing. .just liquid broth with some bamboo)"}
{"text":"Very impressed. Group of 4. We had a wide variety of items.  Udon, dumplings, sushi,ramen, wontons.  All were very good.  I had the Bang Bang shrimp and Cambodian sushi. Both were great.  Will be back."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and got fantastic service from Brandon. We started with crab rangoons & fresh summer rolls, both were great. The summer rolls came with both a seasoned vinegar and a peanut sauce that I loved. The spicy udon was full of fresh veggies and perfectly seasoned. And I probably could've drank the lemon truffle oil vinaigrette over the salmon carpaccio, it was amazing. We had both the strawberry spring rolls and the cheesecake rangoons for dessert and the only thing I would've changed is the cheesecake inside the spring roll and the strawberry inside the rangoon- they were both fantastic, I'm just greedy with the cheesecake.    We didn't have room to even crack the sushi menu but I'll definitely be back to try it!!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for date night. Our waiter was very friendly and knew a lot about the menu. Service was average, but not in a bad way. The food was really good - I recommend the pork and crab eggrolls! My boyfriend got Thai basil with chicken and he loved it. I ordered the fried rice and it was pretty good but I probably won't get it again. We did order one piece of sushi, The spicy tuna roll. It was really, really good. We will definitely be back to try some more menu items!"}
{"text":"I agree with Jane - I really really want to like this place. However, I was quite let down.  I anticipated this place opening and was thrilled to go there for the first time. The menu does look fantastic and I will have to go again to try something else; I ordered the Green Thai Curry. I LOVE green thai curry and this one just wasn't anything special. Very blah. The portion didn't even fill me up. However, my friend ordered the pho and had plenty. I was impressed with the wines they had by the glass but they had no drink specials on a Monday night.  The service was not great. Our appetizer came a minute or two before entrees, even since we confirmed he had put our appetizer in after waiting for 15 minutes. I asked for a fork (to eat curry soaked rice) and had to wait for our server to run two tables other cards before he went into the back to bring me one. He also mixed up our tabs, but did fix it when we caught it. Again, this was a Monday night.  Finally, the ambiance. I was so excited to see the inside in person, rather than on instagram! However, NONE of their seats have a back! We sat at a bench table, but I noticed no other seating options had any back support. And I could barely hear my friends across the table. There was no cloth in there to absorb sound.  Overall, a giant \"eh.\" And a disappointed lack of excitement."}
{"text":"Pretty average fast food Asian - disguised as a real restaurant. Chicken shredded and placed on dishes, same with shrimp, curry's are the same for all meals. Nothing has been really cooked from scratch for your meal - it is just a sauce with stuff added on. Sushi is just average - not worth going here for sushi. Pho Real is much better and that is a chain!!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  But all the seats are impacted by the door opening and closing too much.  The bar area is secluded,  but the seats get a blast of cold air while you are eating.  Too bad, because the food was great."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely fantastic.  Appetizers are extremely sharable so you can try many!  Entrees are unique and delicious.  Enough to share those as well.  And the drinks - the sake in  a carafe was extremely different and wonderful.  Couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere - the service was lacking but it was to be expected with restaurant week."}
{"text":"Loved it! We got the mango summer rolls to start with. They were really fresh and not fried! They came with a peanut sauce but I don't like peanuts like that so I used the other spicy sauce it came with to dip in. The rolls were filled with cilantro, mango, lettuce, peppers, avocado, and cucumbers. I was really a fan! I wish the cilantro and lettuce had been chopped up a little more finely thought because with certain bites it all came out. I ordered the firecracker roll and my boyfriend ordered the spider roll. Both really tasty! Wish they had more tempura options. Overall a great atmosphere for date night or casual lunch with friends! They have a large bar area also!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Co. I've been to their other locations in Myrtle Beach and Charleston. The Hanoi noodles and spicy tuna crunch are my favorite items on the menu. I just recently visited the CO in Charlotte and had an overall great experience. The food was just as delicious and my server was very knowledgable about the menu. I will definitely be returning! I highly recommend to try this restaurant. Good food and great service!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my to try list forever and I am glad we had the chance to go out and sample several items.  The bar area is neat! I love the huge pillar in the middle that fans out to cover the entire ceiling. The bartender was quick to create our cocktails while we waited for a table. There was a 30 minute wait for our group of 3 - we called earlier and they do not take reservations.   The menu has a diverse range of options which was great since our group had a range of dietary preferences. I started with the beef & kimchi dumplings which were stuffed full of beef and in a delicious sauce. Seriously - I was trying to discretely soak the dumplings completely in the sauce before every bite. I had the pad thai as my main (just because the person sitting next to me at the bar had it and it looked and smelled AH-mazing). It could have used a touch more flavor... and cue the delicious Singapore sauce that they brought to the table in a little bottle. That definitely kicked up the spice level to closer to what I wanted.   The only downside to the experience was that we did not see our waitress often. Someone in our group had a long wait to eat her appetizer because she needed a fork. Our waters remained empty after the entrees arrived."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood trendy spot to chill and kick off the night !!! Especially the awesome bartender ask for Tori and tell her I sent you :)"}
{"text":"I'm smitten with CO! We've been for both dinner and Happy Hour and we had great experiences and meals for both. We also went in with a group of 6 and everyone agreed that the atmosphere, food, and drinks are all fantastic!    Over the course of a few visits, I've tried the Pork Belly Bun, Garlic Sesame Tuna Taco, Chicken Katsu Bahn Mi, Pork Belly Bahn Mi, Drunken Noodles, Spicy Pulled Pork Tacos, and a few of their drinks. I've tried a few of their cocktails, but I keep going back to Aperol Goldeneye....it's Pinapple(y) Goodness that shouldn't be missed!    Sadly, there are a few consistencies that are forcing me to give 4 stars instead of 5. The Chicken Katsu is always overcooked and dry as a bone!  They use WAAAAAAYYYYY too much Cilantro...even for this Cilantro lover!  The servers need some serious retraining on how to deliver and collect plates from tables. Every server that we've had so far has been super friendly, but why do they insist on serving over people's heads and pass plates in front of one person to get to another?  Seriously?!?  I just don't get it and other people have noticed the service issue during their visits, too."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Server, Nikki, was attentive and had great advice for selections.  The patio was a great place to enjoy a fall day. The Singapore hot sauce is delish!"}
{"text":"I've been to CO almost a dozen times and every time myself and the people I'm with have enjoyed everything. My personal favorite is the spicy beef pho and the Korean rice bowl. Seriously delicious!"}
{"text":"Expensive for instant pho package noodle taste!!!! Meat balls were horrible!! Shredded fully cooked chicken strips from Us Foods. I am a Chef myself they could've hire a better executive chef or cook"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had! We had to ask for water three different times. Two of us got the drunken noodles which tasted like sticky dry noodles with vinegar. When we politely brought this up to the waitress and asked for a different dish she goes \"I just can't give free food away I have to talk to the manager\" um what!?!? We didn't ask for free food we just asked for a different dish. She came back rolled her eyes and said \" he said he'll do it\" Then it took them 25 min to bring us our new dishes. When the manger brought us our food he said \"I apologize for the delay we just had to  get other orders out before yours\" towards the end of the meal. It took the waitress 15 min to bring us our checks and another 10 min to bring them back. The food was bad, the service was horrible. Waitress had a terrible attitude, condescending all night. A complete disappointment. Don't waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"After a long day of traveling i was in desperate need of food.    It is St. Patrick's day so all of the bars and restaurants are hoppin'....  My husband and I sat at the bar and ordered edamame, firecracker roll, and spicy beef pho.  I was shocked at how fast everything came out and so happy because we were starving. #allthefeels As icing on the cake our service was perfect.  I loooveeeddd the firecracker roll and my Husband said the pho was different but in a good way.  It had lots of flavors and got better as he kept eating it.  I was excited to find out CO does 1/2 price sushi on Thursdays from 4-6:30.  We will be back ASAP for this!!!"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and really enjoyed everything. The decor is simple but beautiful. Our server was very sweet and attentive. And the food was great! We ordered the pork belly buns which were delicious, I wish you got more than two bc they were sooo good! We also ordered the Vietnamese Ramen and the Miso Ramen, both great! I really can't think of anything bad to say about this place. We'll definitely go back a few times."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, ordered a couple of sushi rolls and service was extremely slow, food was good, but took an extremely long time to get sushi rolls to the table."}
{"text":"Still 5 star. We met for dinner here last night and it was a crazy good value during happy hour (4-7p). Everything we ordered was either half price or reduced price for happy hour. We ordered a carafe of the lychee sake, 2 specialty rolls, the wings, the bahn mi slider and 2 tuna tacos under $40 before tip. The lychee sake was so delicious, I would gladly order it next time we visit. Both rolls we ordered were fresh and beautifully presented. The wings were an order of 6 and they were the only thing I wouldn't get again. The bahn mi slider was so good I couldn't stop eating it! It was fantastic, spicy and crunchy. I dipped it in their house hot sauce with every bite. The tuna tacos were full size to my surprise; I was expecting tiny tacos in wonton shells. I would recommend these. Pro tip: go during happy hour and sit out on their patio. Great Tuesday night date night option!"}
{"text":"Good, but disappointed with very limited menu. Cool atmosphere & enjoyed the large bar area."}
{"text":"No one even acknowledged me when I arrived. After finally getting seated, waited another 20 minutes and no one offered to serve me. Clearly not interested in the business of out of town guests to Charlotte. A stark contrast to the warm hospitality I felt at other places in the city."}
{"text":"Ohh my Lord. Where have you been all my life Food was amazing, so was the service. I highly recommend to all the sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Doesn't have a liquor license yet so wasn't able to get a beer.  All the food tasted great but the noodles in my wife's dish were all stuck together in a ball.  GM was notified and he quickly had the chef prepare another bowl.  Second bowl was better but still a big glob of noodles stuck together.  They got to figure out how to resolve that so people can slurp their noodles.  But GM did comp the noodles even though we didn't mention the second batch wasn't much better than the first.  I can see this place becoming a fun night spot.  Hope it works out.  It'll be great for Park Road Shopping Center and the local neighborhood."}
{"text":"Popped up at the shopping center and was curious as to what this place was. I'm so glad I found it! The restaurant is nice, but the food was amazing! I had the Jersey roll which is awesome and it was a good size too! Then I also had the Curry Shrimp which was different but the flavors were very good with the baguette. As for their drinks, which is one of my things when I go out to eat, I had the Jalapeño Guava Margarita and it was spicy! I loved it. The bartender Chris was very knowledgeable and helped me with my decisions. Would definitely recommend and will be back soon! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"The food is very, very good across the board. Really enjoy the sushi, the dumplings and the spicy pho. It's a bit pricey but not outrageous. Service has been consistently poor, but has trended upward - it was horrible at first. In a nutshell, the food was good enough that we came back hoping the service would improve - it doesn't seem to be the servers themselves - the problem seems to be that the restaurant is consistently understaffed. Expect long waits for seating, service, and food, even if it doesn't appear  busy.    One huge plus for the service - a waitress gave my group a detailed explanation regarding potential traces of shellfish across their menu. As someone with an allergy, it was really refreshing to see someone treat it seriously.   Update: went back due to the managers response to this review. It was our worst experience yet :/"}
{"text":"I have been here twice to celebrate birthdays.  The first time I was super excited about the experience.  Ultimately for a table of 4 we waited for over 2 hours for full service.  When the food arrived, twice a friend received a noodle bowl that was so under cooked that the manager tasted it to confirm.  The rice in the bowl I ordered was overcooked to mush.  I ended up throwing it away.    The second time, the service started off extremely well with an energetic server but sadly the service started to get slower and some drinks were forgotten altogether.  The food took hours to make its way from the kitchen.  We were there for about 4 hours.  The worst part was that after our cards were taken, it took an additional 30 minutes to get them back for signatures.  The establishment was not fully and we were seated right in front of a computer docking station.    Overall,  the food was pretty good.  I might try a seat at the bar for happy hour but I would not entertain a full service dinner.  The kitchen was very slow.  Every time I peered into the open kitchen there were several people just standing around.  It was pretty frustrating.  (Considering the fact that I have ran a full kitchen before.)  If they can organize their ability to emphasize the customer experience and management of ticket times, they have the potential to be awesome."}
{"text":"Bartender Tori is probably the greatest bartender I've ever had in charlotte. Not only is she hospitable but very professional. She has all the skills and more you want for the perfect bartender. Phenomenal assets."}
{"text":"Really hit or miss depending on the night and the wait staff. Cherry is the only server I would give all give all five stars to. Anytime we have had her it is a different and far better experience. Other servers have made the experience one we would not return to. This is from a loyalty card member."}
{"text":"The best way to sum up CO: your favorite Asian dishes served in a modern, swanky atmosphere. You fancy huh. Example: I like to wear sweatpants to grab pho or a banh mi. This would not be the spot to do that.   So, the highlight for me last night has absolutely nothing to do with the restaurant and that's not CO's fault at all. Luke Kuechly walked in and stole the focus of every female. And basically all the males as well. The guy sitting next to us jumped up and left his date to go shake his hand. Keep pounding.   This place is really pretty. It's perfect for a date night spot or to kick off an evening with the girls. I saw a group of ladies laughing over drinks while doing a Christmas exchange type deal at their table... and of course whispering to each other about Luke Kuechly.  We started off with the Dark N Peach and the Jalapeno Guava Margarita. For all of you who follow my reviews, you know I'm a sucker for any kind of spicy drink. This was pretty tremendous. I'm not one who typically orders bourbon cocktails when I'm out, but the Dark N Peach was good as well. There's a sriracha bloody mary type drink on the menu. I can't wait to come back and try it.  For food, we went with the beef and kimchi dumplings, drunken Thai noodles, spicy tuna pressed sushi, and fresh summer rolls. The pressed sushi was like little building blocks of deliciousness. My favorite was the dumplings. My dinner pal isn't the biggest fan of kimchi, but even he thought they were fantastic. I had debated between a ramen bowl and the noodles. The couple next to use both got big bowls of brothy goodness. I was immediately jealous. I'll be back for you next time.   All in all, we had a great experience. The service was good. Our server answered all our questions and helped us debate between menu options. I'll definitely be back. I'm sure Luke Kuechly will be, too."}
{"text":"Today CO added boba tea to their menu so I had to give it a try. I was tagged in an Instagram post that announced the new addition to the menu. The post also advertised that the boba teas normally will be priced at $3.50 but for the month of August they would be priced at $2. I tried calling a couple of time to make sure of the special deal and to see if you could order the drinks to go. I finally got someone on the phone and was told that they could be ordered to go but they would be regular price.  I was over the ordeal but my mother wanted to try them.   Upon arrival we asked the hostess about ordering the drinks and she directed us to the bar. When we placed our order we inquired about the special price but were told we had to join their email list to get the price. This was never stated before but the bartender said he would give us the special price. I ordered the honeydew melon tea with lychee jelly and my mother ordered mango tea with bursting strawberry boba.  I was not impressed with the drinks just like I hadn't been impressed with their food. The boba drinks were not like I've normally had before. The mango tea and the strawberry boba had no flavor. I only enjoyed the lychee jelly in the other tea. I would say the drinks are pretty Americanized just like the food and I will be sticking to the more authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte.   Overall the drinks weren't worth the ordeal."}
{"text":"I recently visited CO for lunch with my family, and we had a really awesome experience!  First off, CO offers selections that everyone can enjoy. My mom and I are vegetarian, my sister is gluten-free, and my dad identifies largely as a carnivore. Additionally, a few people in our group really love sushi while others won't touch it.  My boyfriend and I split the ahi poke (finally found poke in CLT!), shrimp curry, and a caterpillar sushi roll. The shrimp curry was seriously SO GOOD - how can a Vietnamese/sushi restaurant do curry so well? I don't know, but I actually drank the curry sauce leftover at the bottom of the dish. No shame.  My dad enjoyed a curry noodle bowl and my sister indulged in a yummy (gluten-free!) hanoi noodle bowl. My mom enjoyed a tofu banh mi sandwich, and everyone had a great experience with the range of food. Additional shoutout to the Singapore hot sauce that comes on the table - you are very good.  While we enjoyed lunch their, the overall decor and ambience seems well suited for the dinner/late night scene. The restaurant is centered around a beautifully decorated bar, and I can definitely see myself coming here for a cocktail and sushi one night. The service was a little slow, but the food is such high quality that I didn't mind the wait for it."}
{"text":"Really disappointing experience.  Came in for lunch with my wife and baby in tow.    We weren't greeted, no one was available to seat us and after standing around a while we sat ourselves thinking maybe there was no hostess.  Five minutes later still no one comes to assist.  Worse, a line of chefs and bartenders didn't even acknowledge we were there.  Giving CO then benefit of the doubt with 3 stars, since we haven't had the opportunity to actually try the food.    Can't tell you how disappointing though.  There's nothing worse than a poor first experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant wants to be in Manhattan and close at 10pm, they basically run you out the door at 9:50. The waitress came to us and said last call. The bar was packed yet they want customers to stop spending money and leave. Change the music and stop trying so hard!  Save your money and go to 18 Asian on Rhea Rd."}
{"text":"We went to the soft opening Saturday night and while it was pretty dead, we had a good experience overall.   First impressions: modern, sleek interior design, expansive menu, reasonable prices, good service.  Recommendations: Chili wings, pork and ginger gyoza, Korean short rib banh mi, com chien."}
{"text":"Spring rolls were bland. Chicken sandwhich was okay but the drunken noodles were very delicious. No matter what you order do not forget to order their Singapore hot sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"Not satisfied...I ordered the caramel pork bahn mi.  I paid $10.50+tip for a sub that had no sides and had very little meat...it had more cilantro than anything.  The taste was good but I feel like I only got half of a sub since it had very little edible ingredients.  This place has a long way to go!"}
{"text":"The sushi is more like 3 stars since it's pretty average, but the menu is very extensive and accommodating to more tastes so I bumped it up to 4 stars. The gyoza appetizers are worth getting - I tried the edamame one and it was super unique. I may try to recreate it at home. The sushi was good, but not super impressive. I tried the tiger roll, which was ok, and the super crunch roll, which was fried so it tasted pretty delicious. It was a lot of food so I couldn't finish (rare for me). I got the blackberry fizz cocktail, which was fruity and refreshing. I also tried the honeydew melon boba, which was also fruity and refreshing, but really sweet. I like the interior design, but overall not a place I'm planning on coming back to anytime soon."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant from a buddy of mine and he raved about how delicious the food was, so I figured making the trip would be well worth my stomach's time.  First of all, the food was awesome! I had both of the taco small plates (pork belly and tuna) as well as an order of the pork belly buns and couldn't have been happier.  I'd have to say, the tuna tacos were off the charts good, but the pork belly tacos were also delicious.  I didn't know whether to get the buns fried or steamed, so my server, Sasha, talked to the kitchen and brought me one of each!  Very accommodating service for a first time patron.  And the house Singapore sauce mixed with a little bit of soy sauce was a phenomenal accompaniment to every single bit of food consumed.  That being said, the most enjoyable part of my visit was the service.  I was waited on by Sasha and she was professional, knowledgeable, and personable.  I was unfamiliar with the cuisine and food, but she led me in the right direction at every turn.  I would have been happy with the food alone, but she tied it all together and made my first experience GREAT!  I will definitely be back and I will try to steer friends and family in the area to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Been coming here consistently 1-2 times a week since they opened. Great specials every night and some of the best rolls and deals in town. Soo, Mitzi, Brad and Brandon are the best! Recommend it all the time to all my friends md coworkers. Tue and thurs= half off sushi and saki"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with CO. The atmosphere and service is always great. I also appreciate that they take the time to review and respond to the reviews on this site. However my issue is with the food. There are some dishes that are great- the sushi has been consistent and I love the poke style bowls that they have introduced. I get the salads there (papaya, Vietnamese chicken, bun xao) they are very tasty. However, I have eaten some noodle dishes that are just over-dressed, over seasoned. The pad Thai was doused in a sweet dressing. The curry laksa was extremely salty ( and I love salty foods don't get me wrong). The drunken noodles are drenched in sauce. If they could dial down on the sauces and seasonings on some of their noodle dishes it would be great. However, it has been such a hit or miss lately that I probably will wait on coming back again."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite new restaurant (of the moment)!  From its cool, yet cozy decor, to the unusual, eclectic Asian Fusion menu, CO had nearly everything it takes to get my vote!  I tried 2 different types of Dumplings (Beef & Kimchee, Edamame Gyoza), and they were both DEE-Lish!  There were so many items I wanted to try on their diverse menu, but I randomly chose Hanoi Noodles...and I was NOT disappointed.  Very rich and tasty...with a generous portion of noodles, sausage and shrimp!  The only downside?  Upon entry, I waited by the door several minutes before this aloof, rather unfriendly Hostess stopped by to assist me...with no greetings, no apologies for waiting, nothing.  She just lifted her head up, as if to say, \"What do you want\"??  She also did not even bother to say \"Bye\" when I left the door.  However, during my meal, an Asian Hostess (Owner maybe?) stopped by to ask how everything was...which sort of made up for the near-rude reception by the younger, brown-haired Hostess.  Also, I only saw 2 waitresses there the whole time...and the restaurant was fairly packed.  Although I did have to wait several minutes for my waitress to appear at my table, she did just fine (friendly, cordial...and even apologized for the wait)...but I did notice that some other guest walked up to the Asian Hostess/Owner to say that \"his\" waitress hasn't come by in over 15 minutes, and that he wanted water!  If only this restaurant hired an extra waitress and better train their Hostess to be more \"inviting\" (as well as \"present\" near the door/podium), I would have gladly given this place 5 stars.  No matter, I WILL return...possibly as soon as this weekend!"}
{"text":"This has been on my list of places to eat for awhile and I wish we didn't wait so long.  Everything was amazing.  Started with a sushi roll that was very fresh and well done.  I then had the Carmel pork bahn mi and it was excellent.   I have always said a good bahn mi starts with the bread and it was great.   My wife had a noodle dish that was delicious.  We will be back very soon"}
{"text":"Delicious. Love love love their bahn mi! I know this place is run by a northerner but a tip from a southern girl in the industry... You guys need to get real brewed tea in, not a Lipton spout. Little things make a big difference!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place.  Went on Friday 10/6.  Seemed totally chaotic from the moment we walked in, but no problem, it's a new restaurant.  After waiting 45 minutes for a table and seeing other seated ahead of us who came in after us, again no problem, we were at the bar.  Drinks were OK.  The beer tap lines were new, so the beer had an off taste.  At least the bartender recommended getting bottled beer instead.  Mixed drinks were premixed in large containers.  With the number of places serving fresh made cocktails, found this a bit weird for the prices of the drinks, but understand the reason for it.  Wines OK and they pour into a small carafe to measure which is good (even though at the table someone ordered wine and it came back at about half the pour.  It was sent back since another person got the correct pour.  Not sure if someone was trying to rip us off or just made a mistake).  Then after being seated, wow, getting drinks near impossible, getting a real napkin or silverware, impossible.  Served water in styrofoam cups, are you kidding me.   Appetizers came, but without utensils and plates the food got cold.  At this point we were laughing.  We even joked about ordering a Papa John's pizza for delivery, but who would of thought we really could have.  Tried talking to the waiters or managers.  Nothing.  Then half our food came out, but not the rest and we seek out the manager again and the owner.  By asking where our food was for a third time, the owner tells us we are out of line and should just take our business elsewhere.  It's not so funny any more when they start insulting the customer.  Terrible service.  The manager and owner are both extremely rude.  Food we received was OK, but way too many restaurants serving similar food in Charlotte.  We will never eat here again and will never go to an establishment with the same owner.  Just awful, Waverly and South Charlotte deserve much better than this place.  Had issues at Ted's Montana Grill next door a couple of times and its great manager handled it perfectly with class and respect.  Not so, here, give your dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time, with my wife to celebrate our anniversary last night.  I had the Spicy Udon and she had the Pad Thai.  We also split a Makimono Super Crunch Sushi roll.  I had mine also with level 2 heat level.  Both of us were really pleased with the food, and I was glad that I stayed at level 2 for the heat / spicy recipe.  The staff was attentive and always helpful.  We sat at the bar while we waited, and they were also perfect.  The cucumber infused Sake was wonderful (I normally am not a fan much of Sake).  The inside design was really cool, with this amazing design from wooden planks, that rise from the center of the bar and over the ceiling.  There were old pictures on the wall of Nobu McCarthy (I believe) that added to the atmosphere.  Couldn't have been happier."}
{"text":"My husband and I were both very pleased with CO and excited to have this great new restaurant in the area. I was torn between 4 and 5 stars because the food and the service were both very good but I felt there weren't enough healthy options on the menu and the restaurant was pretty cold so we kind of rushed out but I will say everything we ordered tasted delicious and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good asian fusion restaurant. Their pork and ginger dumplings are very delicious. Wings are good. Their ramen is flavorful but doesnt come with a soft boiled egg, rather it's hard boiled. Stir fried noodles are ok. Love the decor and drunks are reasonably priced. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Tried Co for the first time after a hot day at the golf tourney. Hands down best sushi I've had in a few months. Small little chill spot to grab a quick DELICIOUS bite. Cool environment and Rosie was super on the ball. Will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Beef Kim Chee potstickers, the Avocado Mango spring rolls, the spicy pork tacos and the cheesecake wonton dessert via the Yelp app to pick up.   Pot stickers: ok flavor, but did not detect any kimchee.   Avocado Mango was delicious and the sauce was good.  Spicy tacos were not spicy at all, but pretty bland.  The dessert would have been good, but they gave it to me without lids on the chocolate and vanilla sauces and they just sloshed together in the container.   There was also a side of Cilantro and onions that had gone bad (smelled so gross!), so I just tossed it.   Meh."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmm, well... I suppose CO is a great spot for \"Asian Fusion\" if you aren't into authentic Asian cuisine. The pricing is a bit much for the experience... $17 at lunch and I'm not quite thrilled.  CO is definitely a mainstream restaurant with flare on the ceiling decor but I personally didn't find any flare in the food choices. I visited with my friend and coworker who is Asian and we are in agreeance that it was OK for taste factor. I ordered the wings , which definitely needed more time marinating in the sauce vs pouring it on top . I couldn't taste anything but the fired chicken flavor . I also ordered the curry shrimp , this was yummy but it wasn't very Asian flavored.   What I did like about CO was the fast, friendly service and the quickness of our food coming out. I think because of the area they will get continuous customers because there isn't anything close to compare it to , but I need more pizzazz to get my flavor tastebuds excited."}
{"text":"We have been to CO several times, and it's one of our new favorites.  CO is located in the same shopping center as Flying Biscuit, at the corner of Woodlawn and Park Rd.  Their food is extremely flavorful, with a good deal of spice, and I'm thrilled they've opened in Charlotte!  We have tried the pork belly buns, pork gyoza, and spinach dumplings.  The buns are pretty good, but a bit messy to eat.  I only wish the pork belly was served a little crispier.  The gyoza dumplings are delicious, especially with their dipping sauce.  I preferred the spinach dumplings more than my husband, simply because of that amazing creamy, lemon sauce.   For our entrees, I usually stick with the pressed salmon and avocado with lemon aioli.  The pieces are big and yes, they are a bit hard to get into my mouth, but that never stops me!  That sushi is literally bursting with flavor.  Each piece has a small, thin slice of lemon on top (rind and all).  I promise, it's not bitter!  The lemon adds the MOST amazing flavor to this sushi.  I'm literally salivating now just thinking of it.    My husband has had their curry laksa, a spicy coconut noodle soup with shredded chicken and shrimp, and beef pho.  The laksa soup is very spicy, and oh, so good!  I always help myself to a few spoonfuls, and keep wanting to go back for more.  He said their beef pho is some of the best he's ever had.  The broth is very fragrant and flavorful.  For beverages, we have tried the cucumber mojitos, but we also love just getting club soda with lime on hot days.  Their mojitos are delish!    Service is always good here.  On our first visit, our server (I wish I knew his name) was truly stellar - there when we needed him, unobtrusive when we didn't.  Even sitting outside on their lovely, shaded patio, service is very attentive.  CO's decor is very modern.  The bar is truly amazing, and sets this place apart from the typical Asian restaurant.  There's not a lot of seating, but we sat near the back, in tables meant for sharing with other parties.  The music they play is sort of edgy lounge music (think Nightmares on Wax), and is very fitting to the atmosphere.    I'm kind of glad we don't live very close to CO.  Otherwise, I'd want to go every weekend for dinner!  It's well worth the trip, though, and I know we'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"The food is fresh with fresh garnish, herbs and spices. Tuesday and Thursday is half off rolls. And since they have happy hour 4-7 every mon-fri, by combining happy hour (1/2 off select small plates and drinks) with Tuesday and Thursdays you get a great deal.   My main reason for not giving the restaurant 5 stars is deception on the menu. It might not be intentional but it's there.  They list a \"KOBE BEEF\" roll. There are only 9 restaurants in the entire United States authorized to serve Kobe (a specific region of Japan) beef. Example: http://www.businessinsider.com/8-restaurants-that-serve-real-kobe-beef-2016-7#8-teppanyaki-ginza-onodera--honolulu-hawaii-8      Wagyu in the US is usually a cross-bred derivative. It's one thing to say you are serving \"US Bred Wagyu\" but to go so far as stating \"KOBE\" is deceptive and misleading. Why lie when your food is delicious anyway? Just list it as \"Wagyu-like beef\"!    I'm a food fanatic who is passionate about food, its cultivation methods, harvesting methods, use of humane slaughtering, etc. I have read many books well beyond my formal education. It pains me when I see restaurants seemingly take advantage (intentional or not) of the average customer's gullibility. Especially when it is not necessary and the food would still taste great."}
{"text":"Love the idea of this place. After we spent almost three years in Singapore we want this neighborhood place to work! The menus is awesome. Unfortunately they had a bit of a problem getting my Curry Laksa to me hot... Anyone that has ever eaten this dish from a hawker center knows it needs to be HOT. Good news is the flavored were rich, the management adjusted the check and we left happy. I know after two week we just experienced growing pains, we want it to work.PS The bartender made me two incredible Dark Rum Mojitos . Cannot wait to go back and give the fourth star. Update: I have taken out the Bahn Mi here at least three times since our initial dining experiences here. This is a great sandwich here and gets at least a half star more than my first two experiences here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My niece is vegan and my brother is gluten intolerant and they had menus to suit all of our pickiness. The Vietnamese ramen was delicious. My niece loves the spicy udon. The Vietnamese chicken salad was so fresh with the perfect citrusy lime vinaigrette. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my visit to CO today. I'm always excited to try asian fusion restaurants because they always bring creative twists to some of my favorite dishes!   The place itself looks very modern and new. If you're looking for a place to eat soupy noodles in your sweatpants after a crazy night out, this is not the place for you. If you are a stickler for authentic food, this isn't exactly the place for you either. BUT- if you want to try some delicious sounding dishes, then we've hit the jackpot.   What I ordered: 1. Malaysian Chili Wings (small plates): For $7:50, you are given 6 deliciously marinated wings. Slightly sweet from the coconut milk, but also a little spicy/tang. These wings satisfy all the tastebuds. I wish the wings were more crispy though. That would have provided the idea texture.  2. Curry Laksa ($15): I read somewhere that the broth is cold, that is not true! The curry laksa comes with chicken, shrimp and noodles in a scrumptious broth filled with coconut milk flavor. The soup was not too watery and not too viscous. It was the perfect medium. Plus- it's perfect for insta photos!  3. Drunken Thai Noodles ($14): My friend ordered this and I'm kind of sad I didn't because I wanted to eat her dish...This was so full of flavor. I would even recommend getting these noodles over the curry laksa.   Service was great. Even though it took our server a while to come in the beginning, he was extremely attentive afterwards (frequently asking us how we were enjoying things and constantly refilling my water). Overall, I had a great experience here and can't wait to come back. I've got my eye on the pork belly banh mi!"}
{"text":"Co is a fantastic restaurant. I had never eaten Vietnamese before and wow was I thrilled with their food. The cucumber sake was refreshing and delicious and every thing we ordered exceeded expectations exponentially. The ramen was so savory, the crab and pork egg rolls phenomenal and the specialty sushi roll we got was perfect. When we finished eating we began talking about when we would be back. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is new and has some good noodle dishes. It's trendy and a little pricey but it's a good spot for happy hour."}
{"text":"This place was not a disappointment!  It was happily delicious and left me with some cravings to come back!    I tried the wontons, dumplings, and curry shrimp for appetizers and loved them all!  The curry shrimp is my favorite and the sauce was so flavorful.  It comes with bread for dipping.  The Curry Laksa was  soooooo good!!!  I was very impressed with the flavor of the sauce.  I got the drunken noodles, which was also very delicious.    The service was ok.  I was more thrilled with the food.  I came back shortly after my first visit because I was so excited to try the steamed bun.  I would definitely pick the other menu items OVER that.  It was not what I had hoped."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for lunch or dinner! The spicy pork tacos are phenomenal! The only thing that has been slightly frustrating is we order the Thai boba tea with tapioca and every time we order it, they're always out of tapioca! We've tried to order it different times and different nights and we've only managed to get it once out of 9 different orders! We've gone at such different times and they don't ever seem to have it anymore. If you don't ever have it, I don't know why you put it on the menu or why you can't stock enough of it. We haven't been able to get it that way in over 2 months now. The rest of the food is great though!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and enjoyed the bun xao with tofu. Was very tasty though the noodles were a bit clumpy. The atmosphere was fun and the service was good. Also ordered the spicy tuna crunch roll that was excellent - and the ahi poke tuna which was solid. Just wish the noodles were a bit fresher and the tofu was a bit more plentiful on my salad."}
{"text":"Co is good - not super authentic, as you would expect from a trendy restaurant that serves Asian food from a variety of cuisines, but it still tastes good!  My favorites are the dumplings (all types are a safe bet) and the Banh Mi.  The noodle dishes are a solid choice.  The pressed sushi is interesting in concept but didn't do much for my taste buds."}
{"text":"Great food and the service was amazing. John did a great job. Great place to eat and the happy hour menu is perfect."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this new spot last minute for dinner this week, and I am so glad we gave it a try.  The dumplings are perfect to try as an appetizer.  Try the beef and kimchi, they were delish.  The Pho Ga was THE BEST...shredded chicken and herbs in a beef broth.  If you like Pho then this one is for you.  We will definitely be back again tonight for the Pho and to try their sushi next."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant! My wife and I had a fantastic dinner this week here. Bang Bang Shrimp sushi, Curry Laksa, Korean Rice Bowl, Mango Summer Roll, Half Priced Sake Carafe - All delicious! And the service was good. It did take a minute to get our check at the end of the meal, but overall the experience was good and we will be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Highly recommend. Great mix of different cuisines. Tried a few things on the menu and like them all."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Came here a week ago. It's fairly pricey and the food was not good at all. Server struggled throughout service and was not busy at all. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"It took 15 minutes to even get a drink order. Food took 30 minutes for Pho! Pho takes no more than 5 minutes to make... finished our food server was no where to be found for 15 minutes... food is definitely too expensive and not even tasty.  I'm never going back to this place! Oh yeah they give you a super small portion of noodles!"}
{"text":"CO must be short for come over because the Asian fusion here calls for foodies like me and you! The atmosphere is cool and casual, but still with a modern and prestige ambience. I am yet to try the sushi, but the tuna tacos and and poke bowls are superb. If fish could drown, they'd drown in the delicious flavor of these dishes."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is casual but very \"Uppy\" service is not bad but can have some improvements. I had the Vietnamese Rame. I added wakame, mushrooms and scallions (they should add it to the original one) it's definitely not spicy so if you like spicy food you need to ask for it before ordering. I asked for chili oil and they gave me a spicy sauce (definitely not chili oil) it had a different taste to it and texture too (it may have peanuts). The broth and noodles weren't really hot like a ramen should be. The noodles got really mushy really fast and they had a \"different\" taste to them, not bad just different. The egg was good. Overall it was ok. Definitely would make some improvements. Not opposed to coming back and giving it a second try."}
{"text":"I LOVE CO!!!! This place is amazing! It is so modern/cool/unique, such a cool new location in Charlotte!  I was in town visiting from Southern CA and we decided to try this place and thought the food was soooo good! I want them to open one in LA! My husband and I went for dinner and ordered a few different things to try - all were hot and tasted so good.  One of my favorites was the Curry Shrimp Appetizer, I could have literally drank a cup of this sauce.  The sushi rolls were great along with their variety of unique cocktails.  We also had the Crispy Cheesecake Wontons for dessert and they were so tasty and something we had never had before.   We were surprised to find out that this restaurant recently had its grand opening! We didn't see signs of that at all.  Our waiter was very attentive to us, food came out quickly and was warm, and over all it was a great experience.    We actually went back for a second time for lunch while we were in Charlotte, this time my husband had the Pad Thai and I got the Hanoi Noodles.  Both were very good, I would highly recommend the Hanoi Noodles with chicken, they are noodles that I think are stir fried in curry sauce - so good! I have never had anything like this in LA and wish I could find a place that has them because I'd like to order it again!"}
{"text":"We already loved CO and have been a couple of times, but we had the pleasure of meeting Heidi tonight and had a fantastic evening, Heidi was so attentive to us and helped people in our group who had never had Thai navigate choices that they would like. She was funny, personable and just all around awesome. She is officially are go to waitress ever time we come now. The food is amazing as always and I had the Vietnamese ramen with scrambled eggs while my boyfriend had the drunken noodles and while my boyfriends parents had bahn mi and curry laksa. For apps we had edamame, beef and kimchi gyoza and spring rolls. Best Thai pho in Charlotte. Could not say enough good things about Heidi and CO. Customers for life."}
{"text":"The sushi is so good here! Highly recommend CO. Quality food and service! The bar area is super cool."}
{"text":"CO has been my go to spot since it originally opened in Charleston. I love the concept and atmosphere and not to mention the food is amazing!!! I'm obsessed with it all.. everything taste so flavorful from the beef and kimchi dumplings, to pork belly buns, caramel pork Banh Mi, pho, curry laksa, drunken noodles, and the sushi is delicious my favorite is the Tiger roll! CO definitely deserves 5 stars!! Im super excited they have expanded to Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place is awesome! Park road shopping center is doing something right by having this here! I asked for suggestions and was recommend on the dumplings but decided against it and got the edamame spring rolls, seriously get these! Don't skip them! They come with lettuce and carrots, wrap those babies up and slam them in the sauce they serve with them, you won't be sorry. They are so fresh! I mentally said, damn when it hit my tongue. I went with what the server recommended for an entree, which was the Korean short rib. It was delicious! The slaw on the side was very fresh and delicious. I also order a drink called the thai basil Collins. This was refreshing and reminded me of a mojito. If you like basil and mojitos, this is your go to! Honestly, the decor is bad ass in here! Not to mention a very good music selection. I think I was greeted by next episode. But left on a electronic jazz type mix, I'm digging it. Overall, this place would be an AWESOME date spot. Not sure the attire during lunch or dinner, I went casual and have no issue. Go enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"First, the place is beautiful. It has a really cool big city (all in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center) feel and I liked being there. The lights are low, the music is on the loud side...so if you are on the grumpy side of flexibility, you should probably make a more conservative choice.   So with only being open a few days, the restaurant was crowded but we got the last table on a Wednesday night.   Really good: 1. Food - props for doing a really great job on Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, etc. I ordered the beef pho and liked it a lot. Nothing not to like.  2. Prices seemed reasonable to me 3. Atmosphere - awesome, cool, & fun!  Not great (yet) 1. Service - everyone is still figuring things out IMHO. Staff should probably learn the menu better and get really passionate about explaining dishes. It wasn't bad but it just needed to be a bit better and think this is to be expected during week 1. I imagine myself at a new job and feeling a bit clueless. 2. Kitchen - super slow but again, new restaurant and don't hold against them.  3. Music - a tiny bit loud but at the same time I kinda like it. I think though it might be hard to talk with a bigger group."}
{"text":"I love Co. Family in town - let's go to Co! Date night - let's go to Co! Girls night out - ooh let's go to Co!! Dinner out with the hubs and kid - Co it is!  Something about this place keeps me coming back. Well, that 'something' might be the gauva jalapeño margarita or the drunken noodles or may be the chicken pho? I mean, there's a long list of somethings... And that includes the chic ambiance, good service and the fact that they're pretty kid friendly. That becomes an important criteria when you want to dine out at a nice place, and you want to bring the lil one along. While I've never sat at their bar, they have a really neat looking bar! During these summer months, I love sitting outside (despite the less than comfortable couches), sipping one of their many delicious cocktails and eating one of their delicious noodle dishes. The rice and noodle dishes are my favorite, but they have a pretty extensive menu ranging from Bahn mi and sushi to larger plates. If you haven't been there yet, you're missing out.."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Vietnamese food so I was a little shaky about CO. Surprisingly, I loved it. I loved the environment and the food was great. My waiter Mitzi was very helpful and welcoming. The spider rolls are amazing! I'll definitely eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"After much deliberation on whether or not to hit up Doan's, Rai Lay, or Hibiscus, we decided on checking out CO for the very first time, and man I'm regretting not coming here before! CO is quietly nestled next to the entrance of Back Lot, and has dark windows to kind of separate your experience from the bustle of Park Road Shopping Center. When you walk in, you're immediately struck by the wooden centerpiece that has planks extending to all edges of the whole space. Very cool. Kept on marveling at it while eating.   While The Lady and I sat at the bar, Garrett helped us out a TON with recommendations, and also making sure that our plates came out correctly. Soggy bread in the shrimp curry? Let's replace it. Cocktail too bitter? Have some more champagne. Garret was AWESOME throughout our whole time here.  To drink, I ordered the Dark n' Peach, a slightly fruity and herbal variation on a dark and stormy that was complex and wonderful. For food we ordered: Spicy Crab Rangoon: The best cream cheese filling ever, at the perfect temperature. Would absolutely order again. Sushi rolls: Fiji Salmon, Tuna Tataki, Lemon Roll. All of these were great, but I have to side with The Lady - The Lemon one was very different.. it was more of like an aperitif sushi roll, if that makes sense. Very light and refreshing. Small dishes: Curry Shrimp. Holy cow, that broth was incredible. I could drink BOWLS of it. It comes with pieces of toast, but they were soggy at first, and once they were replaced it was much better (just as an extra touch to the dish).  I saw lots of cool things on the menu that I want to try for next time, so The Lady and I (or anybody else who offers first) will have to make a point of coming back, and soon!"}
{"text":"This place is kinda new but I got a recommendation so decided to give it a try. The interior of the restaurant is modern and nice. We ordered poke bowl called cambodian and curry laksa which got good reviews from most people. Curry laksa was good but wish there could be more noddles in it. The Cambodian poke ball was great. Good amount of of spicy crab and avocado in it. Spicy crab was not that spicy and it seems like regular crab for me. But their special sauce was great! Yes it is spicy! I mixed a little of the sauce and it was good. Recommending for spicy food lovers!"}
{"text":"A staple when you're in the area of Myers Park/Dilworth and if your like me drive there from Cotswold/Plaza... anywhere. This place has cool interior architecture and a centering vibe that's welcoming and hip.   A few things you can't skip on the menu: the mango summer rolls. They are the perfect blend of summer,spice and sweet. The edamame spring rolls, crunch with a smooth delectable center. Hanoi noodles, and the futamaki roll.   In the summer the patio is perfect shaded and tucked away for privacy."}
{"text":"Salt. Salt. Salt. Salt. Salt. I'm surprised they didn't salt the ice cubes. My boyfriend wanted to try this place out since he's never been. He ordered a sushi special with jalapeño. I wish I could tell you what it was but the waitress put in the wrong order and we got a sashimi appetizer instead which I didn't care for. My boyfriend enjoyed it though. We didn't realize we got the wrong dish until we saw the bill and the appetizer was $14 when we ordered a $6-7 dish. She didn't look happy correcting it. We pointed to the menu when we ordered. How much more accurate could we get? Anyway, we also got a ramen dish and the drunken noodles (i forgot I didn't care for it in Charleston!!). It was just salt. Oh dear lorddd!! Cooked with salt and probably liquid smoke. Very smokey. I can't describe it any other way. The beef was tender though but the taste ruined it. I didn't finish my dish. I was out of water and my tongue was just throbbing from the salt. The ramen dish was salt and water, again added liquid smoke. It was just a weird flavor I can't put my finger on. His portion was huge and he ate as much as he could before his tongue started throbbing too. Never. Ever. Again."}
{"text":"20-25 minute wait on a Thursday night, around 7pm. This place is really hip. They eventually dimmed the lights and played a lot of remixed songs. Almost like a mini club lol I liked it.   As a starter, I got the Crab Rangoon Dumplings. They were hot and fresh. And DELICIOUS! They were tiny but the perfect size to hold me over until my entree came.  My main dish was the Korean Short Rib Banh Mi. It came with a little cup of kimchi slaw. I put a little on top of the short rib and it complemented it nicely. Extremely good food. Good service from our waiter.   The hostess however was not very friendly. She looked like she did want to be there. Or even seat us. She just looked at us without even saying hi hello welcome.. she was just like, \"how many.\" and looked bothered.. A hostess is the first encounter you really have at a restaurant.. maybe she was having a bad day. It was very busy too. But it would've been nice if she treated us with just a tad bit of kindness. Because it was kind of awkward. Oh well. Still a great restaurant and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing... My sister lives right around the corner and told me to meet her here for lunch one day and I was pleasantly surprised by what I received. I have already been more than a handful of times and I'm never disappointed. First off the sushi is phenomenal a lot of the rolls are unique and very tasty. The pud thai is definitely something that caught me. Most pud thai dishes have a ketchup base and you can taste that they are very ketchupy so I usually never order it however I stole a little of my sister's and wow was I amazed the flavor is unlike any pud thai I've ever had, absolutely no trace of a ketchup taste. We had the small pork buns and those were to die for. We also ordered the crab rangoon and the flavor was great and they had that satisfying crunch you look for from a fried food. The price is a little higher than other places but you get what you pay for. I will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"The spicy Pho was perfect, only complaint there was barely any meat for the price. Very nice atmosphere especially for a date!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and was always happy.  Some of the best menu items are the Malaysian chili wings, the kimchi dumplings  (which admittedly don't have a strong enough Kimchi flavor, but are still delicious), the spicy crab rangoon, the curry laksa noodles, and the spicy beef pho. All yummy! The rolls that I've had have been good, too. Also, try the jalapeño mojito! It's insanely good. It's a reason to go to Co all on its own! The dark and peach is also delicious. The servers have been very friendly the times I've eaten in, although we usually get take out. The one criticism I have, is that when you order hot food and sushi for takeout, they package the sushi in the same bag as the hot food. So unless you like hot, questionable sushi, either don't get sushi to go, or ask them to put it in its own bag!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge Vietnamese fan, but was invited to CO for Restaurant Week and definitely am always up for new things so couldn't pass up the invite. Needless to say I am so happy I went.  CO definitely did not disappoint and I definitely see myself returning soon. We started with the tuna tacos, light and fresh, a perfect start to the meal.  Then on to sushi which was my favorite part of the meal. I had the Kung Fu Crunch roll, OMG!  Salmon, Avocado Cream Cheese topped with Spicy Tuna and Tempura Flakes. I could have gotten five of those rolls, so good. Others had the Lemon Roll, which they loved. For entrees we tried a variety of items, including Chicken Pad Thai, Curry and a Beef Rice Bowl. All were amazing. Along with the menu, we received Saki pairings, 3, which was a nice addition. My favorite was a Sparkling Pineapple Sake. The atmosphere is very cool, but service was definitely not 5 stars...but again it was Restaurant Week so I won't fault them for that.  Although my first visit was during Restaurant Week, the service and food was so good I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"First time. I could've done without this visit.  The drink was subpar. Pomegranate Rum Punch didn't taste like rum or a punch but had lots of pomegranate floating around. Like, a lot.  Ordered California Roll Sushi to start and it took close to 30 mins to come out. Taste was dry as if it was in the fridge, which concerns me since it took so long to come out.  Ordered Drunken Noodle with Chicken which was a tired American take on my favorite thai dish. Drunken Noodle is a dish with spice to it and this was more on the sweet side. No spice at all. The meal was prepared great if it was what it was meant to be.  Service was not up to par to be located in Park Road Shopping Center. Bartender took more than 5 mins to ask me if I wanted to see a menu. He squirted sour mix on me and my phone while preparing a drink and gave a \"ha, did I get you? Sorry.\" and handed me a glob of mostly wet bar napkins.  I wish I would have saved my money and caloric allowance."}
{"text":"It's okay. Service was kinda wack. Took 40 mins to get dumplings and an additional 10, about an hour, to get our food. Fried rice was ordered without certain ingredients but it came with ALL.  We were hungry so we accepted what was presented at the time since it was the only thing sitting at our table.  The server avoided us bc of the ticket time but that should never be the case.  The Korean bbq sandwiches (bread) was fried. It made it extremely greasy and soggy.  Honestly I would never return.  Due to the fact that the restaurant tried to replicate what Charlotte already had, which did not succeed, but the service was so terrible that we could not even place another order since the food took so long we were afraid of being late for our other obligations.  Plan on being there for at least 3 hours to be full."}
{"text":"Not bad but too $$ for what you get.  The service was pretty slow but we went like the second day it opened, so it could have just been ironing out the kinks. The food wasn't bad, we left a bit hungry. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful though. Especially the wood that comes from the bar and goes across the ceiling. It would be a nice date spot.   If you are in the area and in the mood for a nice asian place, this would be good but in my opinion there are better general dinner options at Park Road Shopping Center."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to go! Great atmosphere! They also have a gluten free menu for those who have a gluten allergy. Very accommodating with people who have allergens."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and everything was good. The curry laksa was huge and more than enough for two meals. It had the perfect amount of spice. I would suggest sharing this dish. Great food when in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"Fabulous gyoza, steamed pork buns, Vietnamese ramen. NYC good at Charlotte prices."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time coming here and it's slowly becoming one of my favorite restaurants. The food and service has yet to disappoint! They have different specials all throughout the week as well as a great Happy Hour Mon-Fri from 4p to 7pm.  This visit I ordered the blackberry sake carafe that was so good, great suggestion from our bartender Brandon. And it was 1/2 off because it was Thursday. For food I had the Spicy Crab Rangoon, Kung Fu Crunch sushi roll and the Masa Ramen. I could have ate like 3 orders of the Crab Rangoon because it's just that good. The sushi and ramen were delicious as well, lots of flavors and cooked perfectly.  The atmosphere is more upscale compared to your more traditional pho/ramen restaurant that makes it a good place for a date night or birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Spider Roll Com Chien Pork Gyova dumplings  Sat at the bar. Food, service and atmosphere were terrific! A little loud, but food trumps noise!  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed everything I've tasted here. The pad thai is delicious. I love the sushi. The pork belly buns were really good. Honestly everything was great. The service is also excellent. I went with my little brother who forgot to mention he didnt want avocado in his sushi roll and when it came out, they happily replaced it. Each time I've been we were seated quickly and attended to right away. Definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"This will be a regular spot for us! I am from Seattle and crave authentic Asian flavors. This is a wonderful mix of cultures with a fresh twist. The pork belly buns, Malaysian wings, and spring rolls are a few of our favorites. The curry latkas is amazing as well. Super excited about finding this spot and coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great meal.  We had the small plates.  The curry shrimp was fantastic enough for 2.  The tuna tacos were outstanding! Great area to sit outside.  Attentive service. Was here opening night.  Huge improvement in service"}
{"text":"Be warned its very loud, I felt as I was shouting the entire meal.  Saturday night and I don't have reservations but I tried to get a seat at the bar based on recommendations. Was told 1 1/2hr wait even though there were multiple empty tables.  I think I ended up waiting 10-15 min for a spot at the bar.   Food was muh. Nothing special  Drinks/cocktails great, Highly recommendable! Music in background was a good mix of oldies and contemporary.  It's seemed to me the younger hip crowd who got reservations vs at the bar was filled with \"Myers park couples\" type  Dress on a Saturday night was far from casual.  In loafers, button down and jeans I felt slightly under dressed. Why do 23 yr guys feel the need to wear a sports coat!  However there were a few others sitting at the bar wearing leggings/uggs but girls get away with that shit.   It's strange that restaurant of this shorts is in a shopping complex such as Park Road."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yumm!!  I'm a bit bias because I live right around the corner, but they have the best Pad Thai I've every tasted! Service is good, atmosphere is cool & the food is spectacular!   The bartender will even make you blue-chess stuffed olives for you martini (however, the olives are a bit bland - I like the super salty tasting ones).  Best part about this place: they have a CO sauce on the table, use it!"}
{"text":"The food at CO is nothing less than superb!   We especially like to go to happy hour Mon-Fri.  We have been several times since they opened at Waverly.  Like all new restaurants there are kinks to work out but you can tell the staff is working hard.  CO has several locations.  We have also been to the Park Road location.   Tonight Cody did everything to make our experience top notch.  Absolutlely love the food.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love Co! Truly one of the best places to get Poke in Charlotte. The staff is happy and welcoming and the service is quick. We also had Pork Belly Bahn Mi's which were out of this world! All the Yelpers out there need to make CO in Waverly one of their next stops!"}
{"text":"My favorite Asian Fusion restaurant in the Madison Park and South Park area. A lot of dishes here are not authentic per say, but very deliciously done. The chef is definitely a sauce master! Their homemade Singapore hot sauce is Devine!!!   Some of my all-time favorites:  1. Beef Pho 2. Hanoi Noodle with Shrimp and Sausage  3. Com Chien with Shanghai Sausage  4. Bun Bo Uoe (not sure if I spelled it right) 5. Ahi Poke Bowl (remember to put the Singapore sauce in, if you are into spicy food)."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Asian food, I would second guess coming here. Group of friends and I came here Friday night not too long ago. Ordered \"boba\" tea. I've had my fair share and this was the most bland boba tea drink I've ever had. I couldn't believe I paid for that. I might as well have ordered water.   I was ready to order something I saw someone else got from social media and come to find out then they changed up their menu. So, I settled and ordered another soup noodle dish. I was highly disappointed. I didn't taste a lot of the Asian flavors. The soup was very oily. Proportions weren't good. I had way more noodles than meat. I couldn't even stomach more than 2 bites.   The place is very Americanized in my opinion. Good luck on your experience."}
{"text":"Extremely excited for CO to open. Stopped by on Friday night at 6:10. Was told by the hostesses that the wait was an hour and twenty minutes despite numerous open tables. Hung around for about 20 minutes with my husband who kept pointing out all of the open tables just sitting there, overheard at least two tables complaining about the lack of service.  Finally got annoyed and hungry and walked over to Rock Salt for some delicious fish and immediate and attentive service.  I also don't understand why this restaurant doesn't take reservations. It's obviously slammed and understaffed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently had dinner at CO and were very impressed. There is such a good selection of menu items - sushi, dumplings, banh mi, broth bowls - and the best Pad Thai I've had since living in Charlotte. Order it with a side of peanut sauce - even more heavenly. This was the first time I'd had dessert at an Asian restaurant and let me tell you - I could eat those cheesecake wontons every day! The owner was even at the restaurant the first time we were there and took time to talk with tables and make menu and cocktail suggestions.   I saw recently they have a great patio space with new beautiful furniture I didn't notice the first time I was there. I'll be enjoying sake cocktails this summer!!  Also - they have a vegan and gluten free menu! :)"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday at 7 and there was no wait for our party of 6. We all were very happy with our meals and very pleased with the specials they offered.   Speciality cocktails are only $5 on Wednesday, even if you aren't sitting at the bar. Normally around $10.   Appetizers: beef and kimchi dumplings were awesome!!! Enjoyed the mango fresh rolls as well.   Meals: curry laksa was awesome! A little heat but balanced with the coconut milk. This is essentially a curry soup with noodles instead of rice. Friend said the pad Thai was one of the best he's had in town.   Will definitely be back to take advantage of all of the happy hour food specials at the bar."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday night before a movie at Park Terrace. I was a little concerned since we were on a time crunch due to our movie. Long story short, we were seated greeted, we ordered the pho because it was half off all pho, so our plan for Sushi was put on the back burner. I ordered the beef, Col the chicken. Also the ginger pork dumplings. It was delicious, large portions and came out quickly. This seems like a great date option or nicer dinner option if you're in the park road area, but still not super fancy. I wouldn't roll up with a hangover and messy bun to grab some Asian food here, but it's not too fancy either."}
{"text":"Half price sushi rolls on Thursday before 7pm.  Ummm... yes please!  We totally planned to go here regardless of the sushi special, but it did sway our menu choices once we found out about it especially since CO's menu is super diverse with a lot of options.  We went early since we were catching a movie at Park Terrace so didn't have to wait for a table.  You can tell the restaurant got really busy all of a sudden since service was a little slow.  Our server Danielle was super nice and took care of us.  The entire table ended up getting sushi, but it all came at the same time with exception to a roll that had been fried (so understandable)... but still it was maybe a min or two before it came after everything else arrived.  Oh - half price off of Sake carafes was a nice pairing as well.  The lemongrass lychee was delicious and DANGEROUS.   They have OMB on tap here as well as Sapporo and other craft beer options (in bottle form).  Sushi was tasty.  I had the pork belly and the spider.  I know for those \"traditionalist\" sushi eaters, a pork belly roll, may not be your thing, but luckily there are plenty of other \"things\" on the menu.  Probably the restaurants interior and ambiance is probably one of it's strongest features with the wood slats creating a cool space that all stems from the bar.  Since we early I saw some couples with small children, so it's nice to see a kid friendly atmosphere here.  The later it got though, I didn't really see how kids would do in a loud, dim environment."}
{"text":"A friend and I tried this place on New Year's Day.  This restaurant in part of a regional chain with other locations in Myrtle Beach, Charleston, and Savannah. It sits in Park Road Shopping Center next to the stairs that go down to Sir Edmond Halley's and across the parking lot from McCranie's tobacco shop.  The decor inside is beautiful with portraits of asian women on the walls and this beautiful tree-like structure whose trunk in in the middle of the bar and branches out into the ceiling of the restaurant. The tables are high tops around the sides and front of the restaurant.  The menu consists of sushi, noodle dishes, stir fry dishes, salads, and banh mi sandwiches. They also have a specialty drink menu...a few beer options with only one being local, OMB's Copper.   My friend and I ordered the Pork and ginger gyoza dumplings for an appetizer. The dumplings were good. Dipping them in CO's hot sauce made them killer!   For an entree, I ordered the Curry Laksa which was beautifully presented. However, the description said it included thai basil but the majority of what I saw was cilantro. There were two tiny springs of thai basil that were dried up on the additions plate. Also all the herbs were wilted and not fresh. There was no listing of cilantro in the description of the dish and many people cannot stand cilantro so it should be listed or mentioned if you're going to use it as a substitute.  Also, the dish was listed as spicy but it was not even close. Adding the sliced jalapeno is what made it spicy for me.  So while the dish was beautifully presented, the described flavors came up short.  My friend had the miso ramen but said it was good but it doesn't even compare to another area ramen place.  Service was decent but we were there early when they first opened for the day and it wasn't too busy.     Additionally, as a tall and larger person, I found their seats to be uncomfortable. They may be trendy but I think most larger people will find them uncomfortable. You are probably better asking to be seated at the red bench in the front.  I hope the other options here are better. Perhaps the sushi is what to order here. Either way, I came out a bit disappointed on my visit here so while this is a 3 star review, it's more like a 2.75."}
{"text":"Curry Laksa, Tuna Tataki Roll and Strawberry Springroll dessert keep me coming here every time since the store has opened"}
{"text":"Ok so Candyce B sold me on this place! At first I thought it was all about healthy eating and still being hungry afterwards BUT this wasn't that kind of place!   I felt like a kid entering Discovery Place... the inside is wonderfully designed. From the abstract art center piece to the modern colors... you forget for a moment that this place is nestled within a shopping center.   For all new visitors, order the Shanghai Chicken Wontons... you will be pleased! I have already planned to order the dumplings on my return visit because the wontons were prepared so well!   As far as the main course goes... it was filling and SPICY! I get discouraged sometimes when I order spicy food at other places and end up having to ask for hot sauce, but the spicy food here was all this country girl could ask for. I ordered the Curry Laksa and it made this chica cough and grab a sip of water. Now, let's be clear, I didn't cough because it was too spicy... lol it was solely because I was expecting there not to be enough curry spice and had already made up in my mind that I would reaching for the hot sauce to turn it up a notch.   I'm technically still eating and completing this review so know that I will be returning! Thanks CO for bringing a new spin to the Park Road area!"}
{"text":"First impressions mean everything.   Having a hair stick out of our iced coffee really set the tone for lunch for us. Waitress was really nice and immediately replaced the drink. At that point I don't know if my husband ordered it because he wanted one badly or he felt obligated.  Either way the drink should have been comped, in our minds if there is hair in the drink what is in the food?  Pork belly buns were the highlight of our lunch. I ordered a cabbage salad which was good. My husband ordered the ramen. It was....meh. 14 dollars for a bowl of soup? Maybe if he ordered pho his perception would change but even those prices seemed a little steep.   I loved the ceiling fixture. Chairs were really uncomfortable,  especially for those who are really short. Do I dangle my feet? I can't prop them as my legs are short. I sort of felt like a kid eating lunch in my elementary school cafeteria. I hate giving poor reviews, especially when the service is great. In my opinion at the very least a manager should have come out to apologize for a hair being in our drink but that's just me. Either way we probably won't be back.  **I have spoken with a Manager who was apologetic and attempted to resolve over our experience and invited to return. We appreciate his sense of urgency."}
{"text":"First time trying Vietnamese/Asian fusion anything and CO did not disappoint! I ordered the pad Thai with shrimp and I removed the peanuts. It was so flavorful and the shrimp was well cooked (some places don't cook shrimp all the way through causing it to be chewy) anywho, on Wednesday's they have cocktails for $5 and I ordered the pomegranate rum punch which was refreshing. Will definitely be back! Oh and Thanks Mimi for being an awesome server"}
{"text":"Attentive wait staff however I had to ask for more water. I was starved not having eaten breakfast. Taste tested the pork sandwich appetizer (don't remember the name), n it was tasty but a bit too sweet for my palate (an over abundance of sauce) n the tough pork was hard to bite cleanly, instead biting in tearing shreds. Ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl which Ahi flavor seemed a bit drowned out by the super sweetness of the whole bowl ingredients n sushi rice. I don't think I'll order it again. Will try something else next time. Sorry but three stars is all I could give this time around."}
