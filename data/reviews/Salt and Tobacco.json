{"text":"After visiting a number of pizzerias in Italy, NYC/Brooklyn, I would say this is one of my personal top 3 pizzas in the world. Which is great, since Toronto is home for me! The crust is perfect for me, though perhaps less crewy than one might expect for a true Neapolitan pizza. I'm quite addicted to the Brussel Sprout pizza which is amazingly flavourful. Mr. Hand is a fav of the kids as it's almost like a Hawaiian. Only tweak for my personal taste is to make them a bit less sweet, but that's it. And if they could open for more hours please!   People are great, always smiling, and a complimentary sparkling water and homemade bitters really round out the place.    Salt and Tobacco has become my go to in Toronto when I need a \"real\" pizza."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place with a great vibe, and great staff! Came here with our soccer team just shortly after it opened and ordered half the menu -- loved everything. They even brought us a little team treat at the end of the night.   Prices are really good, and the pizza and drinks are top notch! Salt & Tobacco is now one of my regular spots!"}
{"text":"I ordered a funghi pizza for takeout one night. It was so delicious, I ate more than I intended in my one sitting, drizzled that honey chilli sauce all over it. The crust was nice and light. I appreciate the simple toppings because sometimes you go to fancy pizza places and they just overload their pizzas with a bunch of flavour pairings that don't always work. Looking forward to trying all the other flavours in the future!"}
{"text":"Good pizza the way pizza is supposed to be made - thin crust, some sauce and toppings that are not tomatoes, onions, green peppers and pepperoni.  They have a honey hot sauce that you can put on that is delightful."}
{"text":"Brooklyn style thin crust, dry-bottom, no-flop pizza! Marinara ($6 for a small one) was a savory killer. Having lived in the US made me a pizza snob and this is one of my new favorite places. I dare say they're better than north of Brooklyn but I haven't tried enough types yet. Was going to cook dinner with my partner but we were taking a random walk in cabbage town beforehand, and could smell the scent of FRESH BAKED PIZZA from several doors down. I am glad for this diversion.  Hot honey and chili olive oil are killer condiments! Salt and tobacco--I love you, but I feel kinda weird that this mainly white-operated/frequented joint that has pictures of black men on one side of the room..."}
{"text":"Amazing thin crust pizza. We love the hot pepper infused honey that you can drizzle on"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, great atmosphere, music, and service. We tried the cabbage pizza and the sparkling water with bitters, and both were fantastic. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Newly opened and great first impression. Loved my small Margherita. Perfectly done, thin crust and properly seasoned. Every thing I like in a pizza. This place has promise. To see my more professional and detailed review on this place find me on Zomato. Seriously, this place has promise. They seemed to have nailed everything. It would be nice if they had some artichoke options. Unusual hours, they don't open until 5 pm daily, missing out on a great lunch crowd. It is 2016. You would think Yelp would be able to have the postal codes auto fill. Instead they focus on Pokystop BS and Apple pay which has nothing to do with the quality of the establishment."}
{"text":"What a sweet establishment. Very family oriented. The pizza was cooked to perfection! Very thin crust, and not one edge was burnt!!!   There were ample toppings and it wasn't at all soggy!!  The menu had a large selection of pizzas. The rest of the menu was limited to, meat balls and 2 types of salads   We ordered both salads, the kale Caesar was so good! Loved the salty anchovies plus there was ample amount of Parmesan cheese on both the kale Caesar and the arugula salad.   The first arugula salad that came to our table... wasn't the freshest, but we mentioned it to the manager and he quickly took it away and replaced it.   The service was good! I personally prefer to have table service, but it wasn't too bad having to order and pay at the counter.    One big plus was they had self serve flat and carbonated water."}
{"text":"Wow, this is some really great pizza right here folks. I ordered in as a treat via Foodora so I can't comment on the location, or shop itself of course. But i will definitely comment, and praise this excellent pizza shop, i must say this place makes some really high quality pizza, i ordered the pepperoni, i know, not very imaginative, but i love its simplicity, as i'm not a big fan of overcrowded pizzas. Anyway back to the pizza, the ingredients, starting with the sauce was fresh and tasty, their blend of fresh fior de latte and mozzarella was really tasty as well, the crust was also perfect, thin, light and crispy, then topped off with their delicious thin cut pepperoni and some basil leaves made this truly Brooklyn style, it was baked slightly well too, just the way pizza should be and just the way i love it. The finessed the whole order by throwing in a Honey chili pepper dip on the side, and holy crap was that ever good too, surprisingly good... what a nice and very unique touch! Very delicious. I am very impressed with the quality of pizza that i received, it was exactly what i was hoping to get. you can absolutely see these pies are made love and pride. I have nothing negative to say about the pizza at Salt and Tobacco, and i will definitely be ordering or popping by again."}
{"text":"Omg the pizza is amazing. I love the ambiance. They have sparkling water on tap, they make their own brew but most importantly the guys there are great. If you're a local or visiting it's a must eat at."}
{"text":"Great pizza, nice people, fun vibe, friendly clientele and employees and a GREAT addition to the neighbourhood. We've been five times, planning on coming back many more times in the near future"}
{"text":"Having gone to this pizzeria twice now, a few things stand out to me. Their crust is truly thin and the whole pie is made to order before you, so it's fresh as can be. You're welcome to flat or sparkling water at a help yourself station, which is a nice touch. I love that the cheese seems just the right amount for my liking, so that it is never too greasy. However, I have tried both the funghi and the Margherita, and found some star ingredients to be rather scant in quantity. There just wasn't enough mushroom or basil leaves on either pizza for my liking. I'm not a greedy person, but if I wanted a cheese pie, I would order just that. Considering that I paid more for a certain pizza, I should receive just that, not the sparest version possible."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza but not much else...atmosphere could use some improvement but that might be just a matter of personal taste, I really recommend it!..."}
{"text":"Great addition to a neighbourhood that could use GOOD pizza!  The space is clean, modern and staff friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh out of the oven gourmet pizza. Love the casual vibe, order at the counter and have a glass of wine while you wait. Eat in or take out. The Cabbage pizza is my fave."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza! I came here with a friend on a Friday evening. It's a very casual place with seating that reminds me of being in a high school cafeteria. You order and pay for the pizza at the cashier. They accept credit cards. If you are dining in, you find a seat and hang out for a bit while your pizza is being made and brought to you. It didn't take long to make, maybe like 15 minutes. You can get water at the front. Everything is self-served.   We got the most unique pizza on the menu in my opinion - the large  Brussels spout pizza for $25 (not including tax and tip). I really enjoyed the sweet maple syrup along with the savoury bacon and gorgonzola. The pizza was divided into 6 slices and they were pretty big portions. The crust was soft and thin.  The pizza is more expensive than fast food pizza places like pizza pizza, but on par with fancier places like Buca and Danforth Pizza.  They serve beer and liquor if anyone is interested in that.  I think it's worth it. Will be back to try others."}
{"text":"Yo fam peep this:  Pizzas here are baked MAD PHRESH for dat a**. I copped this prosciutto joint and I was blessed, no lie. Crust is thin, but could be crispier. Other than that, it's lit fam.  Make sure to get that CHILI INFUSED HONEY to dip your sh*t in. Don't trip."}
{"text":"The service was good and the atmosphere was nice but unfortunately the pizza was bland with no real flavor other than the sauce! Needs more kick, spice, flavor. If anything add dipping sauces, feta cheese and other sauce options to go on the pizza."}
{"text":"Really tasty pizza! I ordered prosciutto one and it had lots of it plus arugula which I like. Very friendly staff and it took them only 10 min to prepare it."}
{"text":"So far, this is the most authentic Italian tasting pizza I've tasted in Toronto. The ingredients are exactly the ingredients served on pizzas made in Napoli. The customer service is great and I love that they offer sparkling water with house made bitters and olives while you wait. You may think it's a little pricey but If you want the real thing this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Such a great spot! Really cute atmosphere and unreal service. Ben makes you feel very comfortable from the start of your meal to the finish!  We were given complimentary olives, there's flat and sparkling water with DELICIOUS house bitters (made by Ben himself). We ordered a couple of Negroni's ($5) and they were such a deal. Super summery, very boozy.  And the PIZZA! Mmmm, I'm already looking to go back. I had the prosciutto pizza which was heavenly... Drizzle on a little of the hot honey and it's perfection. The dough is thin, crispy, but with a nice chewier centre. Nice blistering. My friend had the funghi which was also delicious. He is celiac, but today they had gluten free crust (which they will be introducing full-time) which was honestly great by all dough standards!  I recommend this place to anyone who likes a nice pizza! The atmosphere is home-y, drinks are very reasonably priced and the pizza is heavenly!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the rave reviews people are giving this place. I found the pizza I ordered extremely bland, like there was no seasoning in the sauce whatsoever, and mind-blowingly overpriced at $15. The only good part about it was the crust, which was VERY crunchy and edible. But overall this pizza doesn't compare to Hey Lucy, where you can get the same type of pizza, done WAY better, PLUS a salad, right around the corner... for about 2/3 of the price no less!"}
{"text":"the dough / thin crust taste of this oven cooked pizza place is really good. staff is nice. the special spicy honey is ok, like it or not (I do not particularly). it sounds like the add-on arugula is a must have (forgot to ask), as, like several reviews point out, the topping can be  a bit sugary or relatively bland.   was a good meal, though not that memorable. i will come back, when i am less into basic other pizza places that offers the toppings i really wish for... ."}
{"text":"Salt & Tobacco is a pie-slinging operation that breathes new life into the strip of businesses along Parliament St. north of Carlton. One of the friendly staff members will assist you in selecting a pizza that suits your tastes, along with one of their four craft beer offerings. It's a cozy place to have some 'za and sippy while you unwind or wait for your takeout order.  Must-try items: Funghi (white pie) Sweetgrass craft beer  I tried the funghi and was not disappointed. For $16, you get 4 huge slices that definitely leave you feeling satisfied. Portraits on the wall feature all the members of Wu-Tang Clan. Top notch branding and a well decorated interior go perfectly with the good tasting grub. Salad is also available and there is talk of expanding into a brunch spot. I'm super impressed by this place and plan to go back soon."}
{"text":"A friend took me here despite my protest that I'm a non-smoker. Even the thought of salted chewing tobacco kind of put me off, but my friend was persistent so I went. It was actually a pizza place and no one was even smoking. I like pizza so this was a relief. I didn't look closely at the pizza maker's fingers to see if they were nicotine stained but the thought of this made me a little queasy. I put it out of my head, picked a pizza and ordered. It was quite delicious and so was the homemade bitters I was offered to flavor the complimentary soda water with. I don't usually like smokers because they don't usually care about where they smoke, but the people working here were very nice. I'm still a non-smoker but I think I will return because I really liked everything else about this place."}
{"text":"This is a good little casual spot that's still quite nice. It's a good addition to this end of Parliament.  The pizza is on point. They have a good range of pizzas and both of the ones I tried were delicious. I know every pizza place these days has hot honey, but it's still so good.  The other reviews say this is Brooklyn style thin crust and as someone who moved here from Brooklyn I have no idea what they're talking about, but whatever style of pizza they're making is good so whatever. Call it whatever you want, Toronto.  Having sparkling water on tap is a novelty that totally charmed me. I'm ready to come here every day just for that. How do I get this installed in my apartment?"}
{"text":"I must disagree with most: The staff is very friendly, the place is nice, but the pizza is rather bland. The crust is terrific, but the finish is simply not there on the ingredients, either taste of looks-wise. They need some refinement on how to actually make the pizzas flavourful, because they certainly have the crust down. Libretto kills these guys every day of the week and in every way, and in 2017 in Toronto, you can't be mediocre. There are so many cats doing it much, much better (Sud, Queen Margherita, etc., etc.) Arugula salad is a bargain at $5, but the dressing has too much acidity. Again, small things need to be refined. Also: olives were served cold, a total no-no. Serve them warm or room temp.   I must say the bald fellow is super friendly (don't know if he's owner) and that goes a long way, but the formula is a little bland frankly. It's convivial, but really not polished with deep, rich flavours. Nice neighbourhood spot that needs to up its game."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Just got back from Italy and this place reminded of Naples.  Good ambiance and great to go with friends and take a break from the kids"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best Pizza places you can go to if you're looking for authentic Roman style Pizza. I recently tried their gluten free crust that they were sampling (apparently will have it soon) and it was amazing. The manager Ben was super nice and accommodating, making the experience that much more enjoyable. Highly recommend this place if you're in the east end/Cabbagetown area."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing bring margarita pizza, the sauce was very sweet and there was barely any cheese. One of the worst margharitas I've had in Toronto - the reviews were certainly misleading, and to have one of the highest ranked pizzas on Uber eats seems quite unwarranted."}
