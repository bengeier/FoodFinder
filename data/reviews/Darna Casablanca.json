{"text":"This new restaurant on the SW quadrant of Shaker Square is off to a great start.  With the addition of simple sheer black drapery and light fixtures that evoke a Moroccan flavor, this long restaurant space has been partitioned into pleasant intimate dining areas.  Our meal began with a chopped salad of cucumber, tomato and preserved lemons in a vinaigrette with the perfect balance of oil, vinegar and salt. Our appetizer selection was seasoned Kobe beef rolled in flaky pastry to form \"Cigars.\"  Served with a tahini sauce and micro greens, they were delicious.  We sampled three entrees: lemon chicken, tender, seasoned to perfection and flavored with preserved lemons; lamb shank, succulent and perfectly spiced; and a seafood stew with roasted paprika served over creamy mashed potatoes.  It was all delightful. We sampled two desserts: French Cigars, crepes, filled with cream cheese and cooked in butter until the exterior caramelizes, and  Bread Pudding, richly flavored and dotted with dried apricots.  We will all be back and bring friends.  With daily hours from 5 PM to 2 AM, this is one of the few good restaurants that you can plan on after a film, concert or theater."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a business trip and the food was absolutely delicious!! I was fortunate to be able to try a lot of different dishes since we were in a big group. Foods to highlight:    - Hummus Plate, French Feta, Olives, Pita  - Grilled Merguez Sausage, Israeli Cous Cous, Pea Tendrils  - Roasted Mussels, Fennel, Tomatoes, Saffron Nage  - Berbere Stew, Prawns, Scallops, Mussels, Herbed Tomato Broth, Smoked Paprika  - House Made Baklava Sampler    I would definitely recommend this place for unique flavors!"}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the idea of a Moroccan restaurant in Cleveland. The food was good - but only if you think of it as something other than Moroccan - I really didn't see the influences of Morocco anywhere in the food. We had the sardines as an appetizer, the lamb chops, the Berbere stew, and Moroccan mint tea. Everything was only OK: the sardines were decent, but nothing special. The lamb chops were well done, but sitting on a pile of watery couscous? I couldn't really tell what it was. The stew was more like an Italian seafood bouillabaisse - nothing Moroccan about it, even though the seafood in it was generous and tasty. The tea was not sweet (like Moroccan tea) at ALL. Overall, the meal was good, but I'm not sure it deserves the title of Moroccan or fusion. It was more like glorified new american food ... and for $90, with no dessert, I am not sure it's worth it."}
{"text":"I don't think this restaurant is open anymore. Is this correct? I went here a few months ago with some friends. I found it to be just average. Ordered the vegetarian couscous and it was under-flavored. it didn't seem very authentic to me - more like bland food for midwestern palettes.  I did like the beef moroccan cigars though - appetizers are always delish!"}
{"text":"I visited Darna last week for lunch.  It was very pleasant.  Especially appreciated our congenial server; they strike the right balance with attentiveness but not smothering you.  Great food and very reasonable prices.  I would love to come here again."}
{"text":"Darna, immediately adjacent to Shaker Square Cinema, is a wonderful addition to Cleveland.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the food is delicious.  The Moroccan salad was fresh and plentiful. The salad trio was fantastic, and our entrees (lamb chops, lamb shank, and hangar steak) were beautifully presented and accompanied by large portions of fresh vegetables. This place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd see a Moroccan fusion restaurant, let alone a Moroccan fusion restaurant in Cleveland.  This was the first time I had ordered monkfish, and it tastes a whole lot better than it sounds (Monkfish? Am I eating something ascetic?).  It's true what they say in that it is the poor man's lobster, since the texture and taste was remarkably like lobster.  The flavors of the dish itself were well balanced, and the meal was very filling.  Eating here though does make me wish I were eating  the food from Tajine, a Moroccan restaurant in San Francisco which sadly is closed now.  It was here that I first had superb authentic Moroccan food.  Service was attentive but not overly imposing.  Oh and you HAVE to get the bread pudding.  Best bread pudding I've had in a long time!  OK so I just looked up what a monkfish is on wikipedia, and all I have to say is, what the hell is that thing? I ate that??"}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews about this morrocan resturant in shaker square, we were excited to try it out. We are both foodies, love to eat and travel. We were very disappointed. Moroccan food is known for its bold flavours. Cumin, Coriander, Raisins, Apricots, Nuts, preserved lemons. The menu was boring. I understand its moroccan fusion but most of the items on the menu could be found at any resturant in cleveland, only thing missing from the menu was fries. Only one tagine on the menu. We ordered the Kefta Cigar for appetizers, it was good, average. The lamb couscous and berbere fish stew for entrees was average. The portions were big but the flavors were not there.  The dessert menu was also shocking bread pudding, chocolate cake, icecream......I thought I was coming to a morroccan resturant.  Your money would be better spent elsewhere. Try lebanese next time- Aladdins or Tazas."}
{"text":"Went to Darna for dinner last night and was pleasantly surprised. I haven't had much experience with Moroccan food so I can't say how authentic the meal was but it was delicious for sure.  I'm going to preface this with I had a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com when I visited (80% off sale!). The server was prompt and kept bringing warm grilled pita bread for appetizer and along with the meal. I got the Berbere stew which is a tomato based stew that is loaded with shellfish. The tomato was not overpowering and it was really good. I had them add some couscous to it to give it a little more body. My bf got the stuffed quail which was prepared well and slightly sweet from a honey glaze. We both had enough on our plates for lunch the next day. For dessert we got the White Chocolate Peach bread pudding which was good but not the best i've had.   All in all a good meal but when we got the bill with the discount already included, this place might have to be regulated to once in awhile if I don't have a gift certificate to help out."}
