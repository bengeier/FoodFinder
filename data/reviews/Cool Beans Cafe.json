{"text":"We were looking for tea in adorable downtown Medina.  This place looks like an awesome place to come for lunch.  They have a good-sized food menu (a few veggie options), a case of pastries, and lots of interesting coffee offerings if you are into fancy coffees.  Their tea options were quite limited.  They serve Numi teas which is a brand that I really like as far as bagged tea goes.  Unfortunately, only two or three were free of caffeine.  I chose the chamomile lemon and it was nice. Beardyman got a chai tea latte which he really, really enjoyed. I think that it's cool that they host cooking classes and birthday parties here.  That seems like such a fun addition to an already fully functional shop.  The building is spacious with lots of seating.  There is a huge shelf of games, books, and other diversions for you and your kids.  The service was exceptional and very friendly.  We will be back next time we come to Medina."}
{"text":"Excellent little coffee spot with a super friendly staff, great vibe & good food! If you are in the area, I definitely would advise you go here for lunch or a coffee!"}
{"text":"I liked this place but felt it could have been cleaner. I understand that they do have many diners and the place is like a revolving door with customers coming and going, but I prefer my dining table to be super clean, especially when eating. The menu is unique and something for everyone."}
{"text":"I might be a bit tough on Cool Beans, however I expect a lot from the local corner coffee shop.  First, the coffee is just Meh.  Second, I can't help but feel it could do so much more with events. If events are indeed happening they should market them more.  I would not go here to nosh, especially since there are so many great options on the square."}
{"text":"Today I went here to warm up after seeing all the ice sculptures in the square.  I ordered a hot chocolate, and there was something not right with it, it had a strange taste to it.  I continued to drink it then I felt something slimy go into my mouth, it seemed like the milk was curdled, or something.  So I went up to the counter to let the employees know that there was something wrong with the hot chocolate.  The lady behind the counter apologized, and told me they will check it out, and offered me a different drink.  I did not want anything in return, I just wanted to tell them about it.  As I walked away from the counter, my girlfriend was sitting at the table looking towards the counter, she saw the lady behind the counter looked to another employee and said \"No, it's fine.\"  They did not check anything and continued to sell the hot chocolate.  I wouldn't have minded as much if I knew they actually tested the hot chocolate.  But they didn't. I will never come back here if that is how they do business."}
{"text":"Great coffee selection and the food (both breakfast and lunch items) is delicious.  You can pretty much, I believe, customize any meal you order.  They also offer a variety of pastries and cookies.  Normally you can always find a chair or couch to sit down, relax, read, talk, or just hang-out.  Staff is very friendly, location is clean, and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I went for coffee after lunch because the other restaurant's expresso machine was down.  Happy that I did, and may have lunch here next time.  I had a mocha latte and it was perfect, taste and temperature.  My friend and I had some catching up to do, so it was sweet to sit on the couch and talk for over an hour.  We were there probably between 2:00-3:30 and there were just a nice quiet group of people.  Very pleasant place.  I will come here for sure next time I am in Ohio to visit Mom!"}
{"text":"Second visit to Cool Beans Cafe this weekend.  Last time I just got takeout, but I liked the look of the place, so my husband and I went back to read our Sunday paper yesterday morning.  They have a good variety of specialty and seasonal coffee (and non-coffee) beverages.  I had the gingerbread steamer, which was good.  It was nice to see several options for someone not wanting caffeine.  We both had breakfast sandwiches on pretzel bread.  I had ham and cheddar and he had sausage and provolone.  We both thought mine was better, but they were both pretty good.  There was a group using the kitchen to make cookies.  I would love to go back and check out one of their cooking classes.    The service was a little bit slow.  I think there was just one girl working, and it took her a long time to bring out our sandwiches because there was a steady stream of customers at the counter.  Not her fault, but they could have used another set of hands."}
{"text":"Normally I'd give 3 to 4 stars for such a cute clean place but I went in for a coffee and asked if they could do a pumpkin she said uhhh yeah..... with hesitation in her voice(it's pumpkin season) took almost 10 mins to make it for me and when I left I took a sip and Omg I spit it out. I tried so hard continue to drink it but It was awful there was nothing pumpkin in it and there weird odd grounds or something in it... I wouldn't recommend it or at least dont recommend the \"special\" flavors..but the cookies are AMAZING"}
{"text":"Literally some of the best coffee, paninis, and cookies I've ever had. I love Cool Beans Cafe and that's it's located in the adorable Medina Square!"}
{"text":"Good freindly place, my standard mocha was pretty good but not a fan of getting my iced beverage in a hot coffee cup. They made up for that slight annoyance with a superb italian sub! Decor is slightly dated and the tables worn down but if you like the art on the walls it appears to all be up for purchase!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken salad with cranberries today.  Got the pretzel bun for a dollar more.  It was delicious.  The only problem was that they were kind of skimpy.  When I pressed the sandwich down, the filling still didn't reach the sides.  There was maybe 2 TB for the whole sandwich aof the chicken.   I also got a Mandarin Turkey sandwich for my mom.  She hated it, so I got one of the halves.  I thought it was tasty. It had two slices of lunch meat turkey, lots of lettuce, feta cheese, pecans (I think) and a mandiran orange segment or two.   My mother did enjoy the other half of the chicken sandwich.  If someone I know wants to meet here for lunch, I'd go back.  Otherwise, unless I have a coupon, I'll try one of the other restaurants first."}
{"text":"I Stopped by for dinner tonight at 5:30 to give cool beans my business it's sad to come find out that I had to take my business some where else. I will remember this next time I'm looking for a place to eat it probably won't be cool beans."}
{"text":"Loved this place for lunch! Great chili, and their special cranberry chicken salad sandwich. Friendly, low-key atmosphere and plenty of room to sit!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, good hot apple cider and a very good view of the street!"}
{"text":"Great evening at cool beans. They have a kitchen room where they hold classes. We did a cookie decorating class with the PTA. Everything is clean and taken care of. The staff was VERY friendly and so nice. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I stop here almost every morning for coffee and the occasional pastry or granola. I love it. The coffee is great and they have a good variety. The service is always fast and friendly.   Having three kids, I love that they have couches and games. The kids love it for getting an ice cream and it's a great place to meet with friends in the afternoon. Sandwiches are also yummy."}
{"text":"Cool beans man.  I had a great cappucino. mmmmm and a delicious cinnamon bear claw.  The girls here were very friendly."}
{"text":"Love the cranberry and chicken salad sandwich!  Always have amazing coffee flavors and a great meeting place for friend and clients."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was just a busy time to check the coffee shop out but it was pretty loud and crowded. A lot of kids being loud which made it difficult to order. I would say the staff weren't rude but they weren't overly friendly. They messed up our order even after we asked them about it. By the time we got our drinks, we couldn't even tell them it was wrong since the guy gave us the drinks and hauled off. May try it again if I'm in the area but def better, laid-back coffee shops around than this shop."}
{"text":"Great coffee and little cookies and desserts. Love the vibe of this place. They also have cards and little board games to play which I love!! The owners and staff are very friendly and kind. Stop here for some good quality beverages."}
{"text":"This is the place you think of going to when you picture a coffee shop to chat with an old friend.  It has some welcoming areas, games, and good drinks.  The building is an interesting little piece of history on the square with the old-meets-new eclectic interior.  I'd recommend the gluten free bars.  They are delicious and the perfect companion for your coffee drink."}
{"text":"This place has good coffee, very nice panini and good ambience. Thank you Yelp once again for a good suggestion!"}
{"text":"All those bumps and potholes from my previous review have been smoothed, tamped and re-paved.  All is now right with the world of Cool Beans Cafe.  Under new ownership the place has flourished, so much so that I am forced to visit either just before or just after lunch in order to avoid the lines,  wolf down my bowl of chili and still have a place to sit.  Great work, folks!  (I was working nearby and forgot all about the Medina ice sculpture festival and the consequent throng of people demanding their cup of joe at The Bean.  Kinda fun, though, watching people stare in rapture at the extensive sandwich/salad/beverage board.  \"Uh, yeah... I'll have a King Bee, no wax, with the A.I Root 'n' Toot'n salad, and maybe a Hive Drone shake...\")"}
{"text":"I like this local coffee shop because I live in the area and its somewhere different to go than just going to Starbucks which I am not really a huge fan of. I like that there is a lot of seating and different bakery to pick from. One thing I would recommend is for the seating area to be a little more cleaner. If you have someone every so often go wipe down the seats and tables a couple of times a day and sweep the floors more often I think it would be a little more inviting. Other wise its a great spot to drink your drink and talk."}
{"text":"So confession time, at the time that I am writing this I am not a coffee lover, or liker for that matter... That being said, THIS COFFEE IS GOOD...  Like, Goooood.... For realz... To a non coffee drinker my idea of a good coffee is it it is good black then it's really good in real life. I have never actually encountered a coffee like that before so I always had an excuse for hating coffee... They converted me here, you reading the words of a born again baptised coffee man... Sucks that I live nearly an hour away.... Oh well I guess I'll just have to add a few hours to my morning commute to start my day right.  Also, yes, I am pretty hyper and jittery while I'm writing this... WOOO! COFFEE!!!! Sjeoejrgejej.... Sjsjehehejrjrkr....... He hjdne bejeh. Ejie. Ejdjeke.   HEY WORLD HERE COMES THE NEW CAFFEINATED ME!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a quick cup of coffee to go. Staff was very friendly and engaging. When I asked what the flavor of the day, chunky monkey, tasted like, the answer was \"awesomeness.\" Of course I had to get it, and it was indeed \"awesomeness.\""}
{"text":"Awesome place to meet friends and family to have a great cup of coffee.....love the Butterfinger coffee, hot or iced. And the sandwich selections are tasty."}
{"text":"I love that they have not only dairy free options, but also gluten free options! Whenever I'm in the area, Cool Beans is a must-stop. Yeah, they've messed up my order MAYBE twice, and I've been going for years. Cheaper than Starbucks, but quality food and drinks. Welcoming and kind staff. I can be a complicated person when ordering, but they always remain patient and let me know it's okay and to take my time, and to let them know when I'm ready to order. Chill atmosphere and a great place to have parties, and also work on your laptop. There's a spot where events in the area are posted for everyone to check out. All around a great place!"}
{"text":"Cool Beans welcomed us when we first arrived in Medina.    It is where I had a meeting with the wife of my husband's now employer, it's the place I took my laptop for free WiFi when we were without internet, and it's where I have had moments of calm and reflection and connection with new friends.  Plus, they have a drive-thru across the the street, which I find odd and appealing at the same time.  Truth is, I cannot get over the fact that they serve coffee in styrofoam cups (hot AND cold drinks!)!  While I have read that styrofoam is actually more eco-friendly than paper cups, I really don't like how it feels in my mouth.  I'm a Seattle girl, and the only time drinking coffee out of styrofoam cups make sense to me is at AA meetings and Presbyterian church functions.  Bottom line: comfortable place to sit, decent tasting coffee, free WiFi, bring your own mug."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop and cafe. I've had their coffee a handful of times - they always have great selections. This time I also tried the tomato soup - definitely a winner! It's pretty big with a variety of seating options and no WiFi password - they're really living on the edge. This is a community coffee shop and it shows. A favorite of mine anytime I'm in Medina."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have a nice cup of tea. I would love if they had more cold drinks though, I really wish I didn't have to travel to cleveland to get a nice bubble tea. I would go here every day if they carried bubble tea!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to be. Great coffee, and I absolutely love their huge snickerdoodle cookies."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink with my father in law. Super friendly staff. Large menu. Got a chai latte and added vanilla syrup. Best chai I have had hands down. Have been craving one ever since. Cant wait to go back. I live in Mansfield but am in Medina alot for work. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Great place! I had the secret mustard sandwich and it was outstanding! It came with a side of chips and French onion dip that was excellent. It tasted homemade! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is the coffee shop of your dreams when you picture a place to hang out with your friends to have a great cup of coffee and some food. We decided to stop in Cool Beans during a trip we made to Medina as we were on vacation in Cleveland for the holiday. The shop is extremely clean and the prices are great. The workers were very helpful, kind, and professional. Cool Beans is the quintessential small town coffee shop complete with charm and all."}
{"text":"Great place, has that real coffeehouse feel, iced mocha is excellent. Try their chip!"}
{"text":"quaint little place great coffee and looks like a nice relaxing place have a cup of joe! if your passing through medina stop by and visit them!"}
{"text":"Nice little cafe and coffee shop right downtown.  I shied away at first since I assumed from the name that it was just coffee, and I needed something solid, but they have a good selection of sandwiches, soups, and salads.    Got their \"signature sandwich,\" chicken salad on wheat.  It wasn't anything particularly different, but it was a very good version of something you might make at home.  Good, hearty bread, flavorful chicken salad, fresh lettuce.  Also came with good chips and a weird little savory cream cheese spread/dip (for the chips?)  I also had an iced latte, which was very good.  Great service.  Good prices.  Cool, relaxing atmosphere, with comfy booths, taller tables, woody and cozy but with big windows up front.  I'll keep it in mind for next time we're in town."}
{"text":"OMG. WHAT HAVE I BEEN MISSING?! I've always wanted to stop by and have lunch here but never really got around to it until today and i can't believe it took me this long to try something SO FANTASTIC.  Very nice casual spot with UH-MAZING food, drink and baked goods. Staff was friendly and quick. Love the coffee! Do yourself the favor - ditch Starbucks and check this place out! You'll be glad you didn't pass it up!"}
{"text":"I really love the Medina Square---it's such a cute area. And places like this help make it that way.  I stopped in for lunch one day when I was in the area with my mom after a bridal show. We were able to get some really good sandwiches for a reasonable price. I was wearing a shirt that said \"bride\" on it, and the girl at the register starting asking me if I had booked somewhere around there or something  and I told her about the show we had just gone to.  She then recommended a bakery just down the street from there that had just recently opened. It was nice to see one local business promoting the other, and I thought it was nice that she asked me about things.  Thumbs up for customer service."}
{"text":"Coffee house with gluten Free bars, great quick eats.   Grab a soda or coffee and enjoy a stroll around the shops at the square."}
{"text":"Basically, the only bad thing I have to say about cool beans cafe is the limited seating they have during prime lunch and dinner hours. So much of the dining area is eaten up by a cooking-class area that I've literally never seen in use in all of my various visits. At peak meal times, be prepared to not be able to find a table at all-- which speaks volumes for the quality of food, but not so much for their forethought in seating.   The cranberry chicken salad sandwich is my go-to menu item hands down. It is the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever had. All of their sandwiches are great, but this one is just leaps and bounds above the rest! Whenever I am nearby, I'll make a special trip out to Medina JUST for this sandwich. They also have a wonderful selection of coffees, drinks, pastries, and desserts. The service has always been great. The staff members and kind and they really put effort into helping you out. The prices are decent for  cafe-type dining, and drinks are reasonably priced for a coffee shop.   There is a lot of free parking nearby, and the little square in downtown Medina is a great place to spend a few hours walking around."}
{"text":"I came to this place longing for a good coffee. What did I get? The worst latte EVER! The young barista lady did not tamper (press down) the ground coffee, so the espresso had no crema whatsoever. The result was a bland latte that I ended up dumping in the trash."}
{"text":"I really want to like Cool beans, but I got cold soup again :("}
{"text":"pretty cool place. Good atmosphere. Had the forever latte=iced chai with vanilla and blackberry. It's pretty good :)"}
{"text":"Like cool beans ! It's a type place where u can relax and unwind. Lots of business, and friendly customers. I gave four stars because I do think this place has potential."}
{"text":"This is a local business, run by a friendly owner and staff that will help you find exactly what your tastebuds are looking for.   Great place for unique coffee, teas, and smoothies.   They also have some great sandwiches, sweets and treats.  I have never had anything from their sweets and treats that didn't taste like it came from grandmas oven.   The environment is clean, modern and very inviting for a date, or a collective gather of friends."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Tuesday morning, and we luckily secured a cute window spot looking out on the square. The owner was working the register and was friendly and helpful. At Cool Beans, we enjoyed a chat, a coffee and a bowl of chili, and the warm respite from the spring chill."}
{"text":"I love a cafe with a name that transports me back to the early 90s. I like this place! Cool beans, dude!  My typical order is a cappuccino or a latte, but I've only had the lattes and coffee here. Both were better than your average chain.   The staff has always been really friendly during all of my trips thus far. Cool Beans is good for grabbing a cup of joe to go, but it also has a large seating area with a mix of tables, comfy chairs, and booths. One afternoon I came with my laptop and was able to get a decent amount of work done without feeling like a super douche hipster for taking up space.   As far as food goes, I've only had a salad here but it was fresh and well-made. I'd order a salad again, but they also have a variety of sandwiches and sweets that sound good.   There's a small parking area right down the street if there are no spaces available outside. Cool Beans is a nice place to catch up with an old friend, do some reading, or caffeinate for the day. I like it a latte.   (I'm sorry, I have no self-control when it comes to puns.)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cuban sandwich. It came with a pickle and chips on the side. They put way too much mayo and mustard on it. However, the service was great."}
{"text":"Best chicken salad sandwich ever. Sweet and savory, chips with onion dip, nice touch."}
