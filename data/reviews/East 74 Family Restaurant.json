{"text":"Not impressed at all with their customer service. I walked in with my two children then a couple walked in after me and were greeted and sat immediately... So after standing there I decided to just go to a different place."}
{"text":"Great little home cooking style spot, breakfast all day, good prices.  I had a a Philly Cheesesteak, the rest of my party had some of the Sunday specials, turkey with dressing, country style steak over rice. Sides included fries, mashed potatoes and gravy, mac n' cheese, and fried squash. Everyone cleaned their plates, so I doubt I could give much of a higher recommendation.  We got there about thirty minutes before close, but we never felt rushed. Cool little spot."}
{"text":"McDonalds/Burger King quality food.... They charge for sauce (ranch, honey mustard, etc) which is TACKY and makes eating at McDonalds/Burger King more enticing."}
{"text":"Somewhat East of Really Mediocre. There is a consistent , unrelenting theme of not being too awful to upset people . Just good enough that they'll pay their tab and leave.  My girlfriend had asked for the Western omelette without green peppers and with extra cheese. What she got was lotsa onions and very little cheese. P.S. onion was perhaps not even sautéed prior to going in omelette - very strong.  I ordered the mushroom and chesse omelette. The mushrooms were tough. I mean chewy . I don't know how one achieves that with mushrooms. The cheese was processed cheese. I also ordered wheat toast and got white. Not big deal.  My adivice to this restaurant is simple . Aim higher. Upgrade your food quality. Upgrade your ingredients. You will be rewarded if you do.. Your staff is very pleasant and service is a high point"}
{"text":"Good food for a good price! Eat here several times a month do dine in and take out. Staff is always very friendly and service is always good. I wouldn't have a problem eating at 74 everyday!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for lunch yesterday around noon and the joint was jumping so I took that as a good sign that the food was good.  I went for a simple cheeseburger with onion rings and sis had the philly cheesesteak with fries.  We both enjoyed our lunches and our waitress, Lindy, was very friendly and provided very good service.  Now I can't wait to go back and order breakfast!  The menu was interesting and there were a lot of good choices but I decided to start simply and see what that yielded.  I'm happy to say that the cheeseburger was good and the onion rings were great.  The atmosphere is plain and unassuming and the food attracts a varied clientele.  Parking was no problem and the location is great.   Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Oops, I forgot to hit \"Check-In\" on the day we were here. Saturday morning 6/23/18, and their breakfast was spot on. In my opinion, it's their best time of day. Excellent health grade of 97, excellent waitress, and an excellent breakfast."}
{"text":"Awesome food, always spot on. Great service with friendly people! Anytime we're visiting, we always come eat breakfast here."}
{"text":"First, I'm surprised there are not more reviews for this restaurant. I've been here five or six times in the last two months. I've eaten breakfast and lunch. The employees are very friendly and nice. For breakfast I've gotten omelettes. They were very tasty. At lunch, I get either a club sandwich with a side salad or their chicken. Both food items are very delicious."}
{"text":"Can't believe the meager reviews knocking this all-American place.  We frequent East 74 because my 96 year old dad loves it, they have a menu that covers just about anything you can call American food and there are daily specials along with at least a dozen side dishes.  We have only been here for lunch, but they do have a breakfast menu.  Their lasagna is baked in a chafing dish, is bubbling hot when it is placed on the table, is cheesy (the nice kind of cheesy), meaty and do delicious.  I am scraping the baked cheese on the edges and sides...but I stop short of licking the dish, although I want to.  Run by a Greek family they have everything.  Nothing fancy, but very clean and servers in motion.  You come here to EAT, not for entertainment, decor or romance.  Although the lasagna just might make a date into a marriage, but I digress.  Wife had gyro.  Pile of fries, a dish of tzatziki sauce, the cucumber in yogurt white stuff that you put into the pita on the meat, and a small Greek salad to go with it.  You will have to wash your hands after this one, but it is better than licking your fingers and moaning in ecstasy at the table.  Dad had beef tips over rice and on another occasion Greek marinated pork chops which were thin cut pieces that smelled as good as it tasted.   Desserts are plentiful and include wonderful baklava, the best I have had in the area, pies, cakes (my dad devoured a wedge of carrot cake and later kept talking about the pecan pie). We even bring baklava home for breakfast with coffee.     Understand that he is in an assisted living facility so when we spring him for an excursion, it usually involves food, which is his focus.  Think about this if you are caring, and REALLY care, for elderly people.  They don't worry about gaining weight.  Those days are over for them.  If you have foreign visitors who have not been in the USA before, this is the place.  And if you have some snotty foreign visitors who turn their noses up at the lack of sophisticated food in the USA, take them through here.  It ain't sophisticated, but it is filling and flavorful.    Bring the family or go solo, but go, eat, enjoy."}
{"text":"Had lunch today. Service excellent as always. I had a bacon cheeseburger,  all the way. Which was tomato, lettuce, onion,  and mustard. You get a choice of fries or onion rings.   Love me onion rings. These were OK at best. Definitely frozen. And may have been reheated. The burger was good. I had hoped for more of a handmade patty. Again  frozen. But it was good. Nice size sandwich good bacon. And even the tomato was edible, which doesn't happen often. Breakfast was great."}
{"text":"If you see this place, keep on driving.  Bozena told me, \"Don't go in there,\" but I didn't listen.  If you eat here, the odds are your entire meal will be brown, and though it may contain 4 or 5 items, they will all oddly taste the same.  I had fish (soft brown), shrimp (light crunchy formaldehyde flavor brown), squash (brown slices), hush puppies (brown balls), and mac and cheese (surprisingly white, with cheese somehow in the middle of the \"clump\" but not the outside).  The fish fry is like a brick of wet mushy paper towels.  I enjoy Friday night fish fry, I grew up with it back home.  The batter was not attached to the fish and slid off the soggy (not flaky) meat.  Given, all the meals here are under $10, I expect a diner to turn out some quality product.  On a lighter note, the guy at the table next to me was wearing a \"North Carolina Powerball\" hat, logo and all.  He was a huge fan of gambeling, which I thought was hilarious.  At one point during his meal he loudly proclaimed to a woman I presume was his grandmother, \"Dad gum, that sure is tender, isn't it?\"  Good times at East 74 is what I say.  If you were with me, I would announce one of my grandfather's famous sayings, \"Take a good look around, because you're never going to see this place again.\""}
{"text":"Six of us went to East 74 this morning for breakfast.  They were very crowded, but we got a table quickly.  We all had breakfast items and they were all good.  Breakfast is one of the hardest meals to rate, for me.  Service was good."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this restaurant. We get out for breakfast once a week, and we go to East 74. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"Nice try. Wife sat down and there was something sticky on the seat.  She had to change pants after we left.   Server was nice and prompt.    I ordered the BBQ plate. I'm a BBQ lover and know not to order BBQ at a general restaurant. My mistake. Dry no flavor pulled pork.   Another in the party had a sausage and cheese omelette. Very good.   They ran out of orange juice at 11:30a. Who does that????  The good news is in 3-4 hours I will be hungry again and get to try something else."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here yesterday morning because Stacks was closed.  It's a perfectly good diner - inexpensive with simple food and friendly servers.  I got an omelet with hash browns and toast with tea which cost about $9.  All in all, it's a good option if you are looking for simple food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Pretty good eggs ,hash browns could use a little improvement or a little more bang for the buck.   Satisfactory except it was supposed to be three eggs didn't look like it in the picture does it.   Granddaughter had open face turkey sand which .  Wasn't the roast turkey used in a turkey order but sandwich turkey that you get for a sandwich.  Silverware was dirty needs a little more attention to the silverware.   No butter on the tables.   Great service . Eh 3 stars maybe 3.5 maybe up it till 4 then try for dinner during the week. Awaiting to pay now.     Second time around different waitress never been rushed so much in a restaurant, just seemed unwelcome.    Older person serving, nice I guess couldn't speak the language but food was cold granddaughter. Didn't even finish. Lady kept walking away.    A little better today stayed away for a while a little rushed.   Food very good quality better service outstanding. Ask for Gail."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little restaurant for any meal you choose to eat. The breakfast is served until 2 pm and has a good variety meats to compliment your eggs. I'd suggest getting the pancakes with strawberries, whipped cream is optional.  Lunch and dinner, again, so many meat and vegetables to choose from. You can order from the daily specials or off the menu with choices like Greek, Italian or seafood.  And the sweet tea is just that."}
{"text":"Yes! 5 stars. A great local place to visit. The breakfast special can not be beat. Very busy on the weekend but you can get a seat within 10 min. Always pleasant service  and the price is fine. It is not a chain, so you support local business. My family eats out almost every day and this has become one of our regular spots after around 10 visits. Just try it yourself, I believe it to be a nice find."}
{"text":"This was pretty decent restaurant. I had the fish and it was served hot and fresh. Not much seasoning but good nevertheless. The waitress was really nice and attentive and personable. My boyfriend has the club sandwich and he said he it was just okay....kinda skimped on the meat. We went in the afternoon around 2:00 and it was maybe 5 other people in there so I guess it was the \"slow hour\". I would eat there again but will probably try the breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Greg's BBQ used to be here. Greg retired and East 74, which was in Indian Trail, moved here. I had a burger and fries. Nothing fancy...and it wasn't. It tasted fine and service was average. I'd go back for a business lunch or breakfast, but not to impress anyone."}
