{"text":"The food  here is amazing. Everything is made fresh daily! I am a big fan of their pupusas,  sope de pata. and the tacos. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had gone several times , and I love the place is neat, and good service, the food is delicious well the dish I always order is sopa d mariscos, which is soup with a variety of fish ( fish, shrimp, crab, ) and is very tasty. Pupusas is good too, carne asada is one of my favourite dish too . I definitely recommended it."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price.  Service is really nice and I've never been disappointed but anything I've tried on the menu.  Get the platter and sub the regular tamale for a chicken!"}
{"text":"food, prices, service, all good. Nice space and good location.

I made a mistake of ordering the sampler with a couple of pupusas. What it was was maybe 70% carbs and a lot of them fried. Gotta give them props for their fried pork because I've been on a Latin American fix lately having tried puerto rican, colombian, etc and their fried pork has been the best so far.

Had I ordered the proper things I am sure I would have been a lot more satisfied."}
{"text":"Some friends of mine took myself and my boyfriend here to try pupusas for the first time. We ordered the chicken taco platter, and 3 of the pupusas: revueltas, revueltas con frijol, and queso y frijol. The food was really reaalllllyyy good! I'm looking forward to coming back here more often now that we know of this great place!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad my friend recommended this place. I've been craving pupusas for a while, and the pupusas here are fantastic. I wish I could comment on the rest of the menu, but after filling up on pupusas, I couldn't try anything else.

Want pupusas? Never tried pupusas before? This is your place :)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant tucked away in the corner of a small, easy to miss plaza so keep your eyes open when you drive by! I really enjoy their pupusas w the fresh slaw they make and salsa. In addition, their guacamole is divine and anything you order the portions are always very generous. The prices are very reasonable and the music and service are great. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The pupusas are great. Also their homemade tres leches. Perhaps my only complain would be that they close too early week days. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"I really liked the place. It's casual and the staff are nice. Really good, fresh and well priced. They only take credit or cash but they do have an ATM there. I will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"Once again Yelp lead me to another winner! Was in the area meeting old colleagues/friends for a catch up. 

I find this gem and they loved it! 

A few first timers for the cuisine do we order a lot of different dishes to try. We got the nachos, Carne asada, empanadas, pork with cassava, Pupusas with everything. 

Naxos were huge and lots of great toppings. The asada meat and plantain was a huge hit. The meat was tender and flavors were great. Rice was rice lol the empanadas were crispy and packed full of ingredients. The sauce it came with gave it a nice kick. Casava is always my favorite and it was really good. My friends were as big of fans lol the Pupusas was a first fit them,  they really liked it. It's a rare find in t.o. so glad we got to have some good ones.

Service was great and place was clean! Would definitely go back for the experience and huge portions!"}
{"text":"We ordered pupusas (5/5), tamales (5/5), empanada (4/5), carne guisada (4/5) between 2 people. Having tried many Latin American cuisine around town, I would say Cuscatlan is quite authentic. Compared to restaurants downtown serving Latin food, I'd say their appetizers are super authentic and really does remind me of the food I had living in South America. For anyone who's in the west end and northern part of the city, I'd highly recommend giving this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"Found this place through one of my Spanish friends 
And fell in love with this place !! 
Great atmosphere , Great  FOOD , great service .
Did I say Great Food ! They have great Papusas ! 
Full bar and soccer and other sports on tv !! 
What else could u want ?!?!? I started bringing my other friends here now and they love it aswell .
Oh it's nice that they give you free nachos munch on to start aswell ! 
Prices are decent and food portions are great ! 
Give them a try if your in the area !!! Or if not it's worth the drive !"}
{"text":"Service was great! They also have breakfast options available. I really loved the empanadas. The beef stew was really tender and yummy. The rice had these pink spots... They were really good. The tortillas were handmade. Super authentic."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here, was absolutely delicious! Can't wait to actually go there for that yummy food fresh."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars for this restaurant. The pupusas were very salty (revueltas). As a salvadoran, this place is a disgrace to be selling such horrible food. The leftovers were thrown in the trash, and the raccoons in the backyard didn't even eat them. Never coming to this location ever again."}
{"text":"this used to be a good place until it was sold a while ago. the food is still good, not very good as it used to be.
the service is BAD. 40 minutes to get a table when the place is empty on Sunday at 12 noon.
ONE server during World Cup on a Sunday!!!
guys: get extra staff before you have to close.
i am NEVER comming back ; lo siento Do√±a Paula!"}
{"text":"Cuscatlan Latin American Cuisine is a great authentic spanish cuisine! Tucked in the corner of an easy-to-miss plaza, Cuscatlan is definately a hidden gem.

Food- The food selection is definitely authentic. For appetizers I recommend getting empanadas. Unfortunately they were unavailable while I was there, but would definitely give it a try the next time I'm there. For entrees, I highly recommend Pupusas (chicaron and queso)...yummmm. It is very filling, don't be fooled by the size. Lastly, for desert I ordered plantain & cream desert. Delightful. For drinks, they have a wide range of margaritas and drinks. If you want to go authentic, get the horchata. 

Service- Great :) very friendly, helpful and descriptive when asked about menu items. 

Parking- Plenty out front.

Verdict - Would 100% come back and eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place is great for pupusas. The pupusa with pork, actually taste amazing. Unlike other pupuserias close to North York. The service is also great. They only accept cash or credit cards, so don't go purely on your debit card. In terms of the environment, is super modern, it doesn't really grasp the idea of a true pupuseria, but a very fancy one indeed."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good authentic Salvadorian restaurant this is it! I'm Salvadorian so I'm a hard critic when it comes to pupusas. We ordered the revueltas with pork, cheese and bean pupusas as well as just cheese and loroco (vine buds). They were pretty close to my moms delicious pupusas!  We also ordered some horchata, which is my fave and we sampled the fried yuca (cassava), empanadas, and nuegados (cassava dumplings). With the exception of the empanadas, we were pretty impressed! 

The only downside was the service - there was 6 of us and we sat in one of the bigger tables near the entrance. We had just gotten our food and were enjoying it when we were told we had to move because that table was reserved. I get the table was reserved but it's a bit unprofessional to make your customers move tables with all their food half way during the meal.  Also, at one point there was only 1 girl on the floor tending to everyone. We had to wait a very long time to get our bill. 

Overall, I definitely recommend it. There are a few Salvadorian restaurants in the GTA and we have tried them all, this exceeds the others hands down! We plan to come back and try the rest of the food!!"}
{"text":"Best papusa I've had in Canada. Also the nachos with carne were fantastic. Highly recommend the food... But it is busy and that means you won't be 30min  in and out."}
{"text":"The burrito platter is excellent, platada de nachos, and carne asada are great. 
The staff are courteous and prompt. There was one waitress that made lots of mistakes and was slow. It she's gone."}
