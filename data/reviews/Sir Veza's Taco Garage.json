{"text":"Can only recommend this place for a great ice cold beer but nothing more. Had the Nitro Nachos...eek, me thinks not! Poor quality ingredients. If they mess up nachos with simple ingredients what other harm can they do w/ the rest of their menu. Restaurant its self needs a little sanitizing & sweeping. I would feel bad about the glass my beer came in but they serve in red solo cups. First time I'm happy to see them."}
{"text":"You can skip this place for sure.  The food is overpriced and it really doesn't taste that great.  I definitely would not recommend this to a friend.  Just go around the corner as there are a lot of better options available in that immediate area."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the airport.  Carnitas tacos are the way to go.  Plus a nice pull up bar while waiting on a flight.  Don't forget the black beans & rice in the to go cup:)"}
{"text":"Tasty drinks, good happy hour deals, upbeat atmosphere. Out of my handful of times eating here I've only had one issue with the food and the server said the head chef was out that night and \"maybe the cooks are slacking\" but that she'd talk to them. Nothing terrible, just carne asada and shrimp over cooked. Otherwise, every other time I've been there... on point!"}
{"text":"Wow. Best airport food I've ever had. Had carnitas breakfast tacos on corn tortillas and they were absolutely delicious. Breakfast potatoes were kinda tasteless but tacos were excellent. Great mimosa too. Glad I was able to get one last mexican meal before heading back to the east coast."}
{"text":"We grabbed a bite before our flight, not knowing anything about the place. Mixed reviews.... the fish tacos were awesome! I really liked the overall flavor & how finely they shredded the cabbage. I am picky about my fish tacos. 

The nachos were pretty bare & the chips were rubbery. 

Would go back for the fish tacos, but that's all."}
{"text":"If you eat vegan food and you're stuck at the airport this spot has a tamale with green chiles & corn, the cheese is on top so they can easily leave it off. They also have black bean and rice burritos and tacos."}
{"text":"Love the taco Tuesday. Also they have craft beer and on happy hour that is awesome
It's close to home and I can walk in get seated and drink a cold one !"}
{"text":"I had a tortilla soup and it was salty , and a hair came free ( in the soup). Little pricer for a cup of soup compared to other items."}
{"text":"Food, average. We had shrimp taco, beer battered fish taco and Nana's chicken taco which was the best of the three. I couldn't taste much flavors and I missed cilantro if there was any at all. We had both sides of charo & refried beans and plane Spanish rice: also missing any flavor and cilantro again. The chips and salsa was pleasant and so was the special $3 \"finish your own\" Bloody Mary. Kids meal was okay but also underwhelming; grilled chicken about plus about 10 French fries and a small cup of apple sauce covered in cinnamon. 
Overall everything was just OK or average nothing Wow'ed us to want to write a better review and/or return again."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to spot. I am not sure what the hell happened within the last month but it sure has changed. My gf sat at a table for over an hour and did not have anyone approach her table. An hour seriously? She ended up going to the bar to get a drink. She even went to the hostess twice asking for someone to help her. I showed up and had to wait 15 min and no one came over to help me either. Lots of people walking around which u didn't know if they worked there or not. Finally, my husband came in after finding a parking spot and ended up going to the bar to get us drinks. Then after flagging someone down to ask if he could help us he said he needed to see who was waiting on our section. He came back and said he could help us. Btw I ended up speaking to the operations manager and imposed the question..\"does it normally take an hour to be waited on\" in which he had a nice smart ass response im not gonna repeat. We finally ended up with a cool waiter which turned out to be way awesome but trying to get over the shitty service for the first hour and a half was a bit difficult. Well needless to say, we used to. Key word.. Used to love this place. Now I'm not so sure. I will be spending my money elsewhere because no one should have to wait an hour to be waited on! I'm not sure wtf they are doing there but with service like that they won't be having repeat customers."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and have been to many upscale Mexican restaurants. This upscale urban Taco Garage has the feeling of a modern \"Taco Shack\" it immediately made me feel like I was on a beach. But enough about the \"home run\" hitting atmosphere. The tacos at this place are out of this world great. They make me feel like I could rise up to any occasion after eating. From breakfast tacos to quesadillas this place is a sure fire slam dunk. Not to mention their amazing Craft, Mexican, and domestic beer selection. You will never leave Sir. Veza's feeling hungry or thirsty. All around home run."}
{"text":"They have and amazing food and excellent customer service. Also if you follow on Facebook all kinds of deals plus music. This resturant was a fun place."}
{"text":"Johnnys the man ask for him food was bomb such a friendly guy first time here will be back for sure thanks Johnny"}
{"text":"I guess I expect too much in the form of actual service. We sat for 10 minutes after order before reviving our drink order. The excuse was the bar was backed up. I'm literally counting customers- 5 at the bar and 5 tables. It's not busy and if the bartender can handle that load, she needs a new job. Food is average. I know I get jaded when the service sucks."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic time! Joe was our server and he was energetic and very friendly! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Can clearly see warmer all food comes out of. Not impressed, and why an open kitchen with greasy walls? Nit appealing."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now for the Senoran Hot Dog, I would have to say the food is inconsistent. On a 1-10 scale my 1st visit for the Senoran Dog was an 8, the 2nd visit a 9, but the 3rd visit was only a 4. I'm not sure if I will be back after this as the hot dog tasted steamed not grilled, the charo beans were cold, and overall the ingredients just didn't taste fresh. I visited the location at 11am so it wasn't like everything was sitting out all day so I'm not sure what happened. I hoped for a good east valley location to satisfy the Senoran Hot Dog craving of the famous El Guero Canelo. Also some fresh salsa would be nice, not to sure why they provide pre-packaged salsa unless trying to go for the fast food thing. Have your servers fill some to-go cups with fresh made salsa, would probably be a lot cheaper too."}
{"text":"My all time favorite place to go during happy hour or work meetings. The staff is wonderful and super friendly,  the food is delicious & the drinks are amazing. I am very picky about customer service and this place by far exceeds my expectations. The bartenders are incredible at their jobs & the servers are always on top of things. But If you want to get the best service always ask for Dee she's the best and will make your visit that much better :)"}
{"text":"Perhaps my expectations were too high; regardless, they were not met.  The girl working the bar had no business working the bar, but I suppose we all had to start somewhere.  Ordered one beer, got something totally different, and she never caught on despite several comments about it not being what was expected.  Food was okay (at the time*), but nothing to write home about.  Late-night happy hour specials (appetizers) were reasonable; normal prices compared to the food we got would be a bit high.  And if you wonder why the \"at the time\" comment, it's because I spent a significant amount of time on the toilet the next morning.  Pretty sure the food was the culprit, and the leftovers I brought home went straight from the fridge to the trash."}
{"text":"They did it up on decorations, and the bartender, Natalie, was great.  Terrific for an airport bar."}
{"text":"Tortilla soup and tacos VERY cheesy and salty. The place was a mess, nobody seemed to be cleaning anything up except me. I can stand the high prices but the quality wasn't there. Would not return."}
{"text":"Long wait on food, poor quality as well. Greasy , skip and hit up Dell taco. Kitchens dirty, and slow. I recommendation is to not bring family Here very irregular and confusing \"style\"."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experience I can recall. I had burger sliders. Had to come out of a microwave. Some of the fries we under cooked and some overcooked. My wife had a quesadilla that was average at best."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times and have loved it! The atmosphere is great and the staff are so laid back and cool! I've always sat at the bar and they have always taken care of me! Definitely my new favorite spot! Try the chromeberry cocktail! So good!!"}
{"text":"First timers from CA and we absolutely loved this place. Layne helped us and she was AMAZiNG!!"}
{"text":"The decor is like being inside you or your dad's (maybe your mom's) garage. It's self-aware (daydrinking headquarters). and the drinks take up an entire 8x15 in. menu. The happy hour snacks and drinks are great price. They really know how to make a margarita pair with a chimichanga. Want a giant, oversized margarita with 4 straws for you and your friends? Done. Bacon wrapped chimichanga bites and jicima maple syrup? Weird but delicious. Unique, fun  and tasty."}
{"text":"We had a large group in the \"Low Rider Room.\" Our server's name was Johnny and he provided great service. Everyone enjoyed their meals and look forward to returning. The Happy Hour Menu is one of the best around. The beer and tequila selections has something for everyone."}
{"text":"The service was pretty good. However, I ordered boneless wings and  they tasted like flavorless dried chicken breast instead of wings. The shape of the wings varied, which makes me wonder if they were wings."}
{"text":"PERFECT!
We're vegetarian... and it's hard to find GOOD Mexican food we don't make ourselves!  
Here, we can get tacos made to order, and crispy corn tortillas which melt in your mouth !  Love it!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken tacos. They were not your ordinary tacos which was a good thing. Very good taste and only about 9 bucks. Service was quick to. Recommended"}
{"text":"They have awesome gluten free wings! My wife and decided to share them. The cook accidentally threw some deep fried onion rings next to them and contaminated the order. So they gave my wife a whole new order and let me keep the old order. Then the manager came over to make sure we were okay and told us about their new line of gluten free beers. He gave us a freebie on the house! My wife loved it. It's called Dogfish Head Tweason Ale. Has hints of strawberry! The place was very good to us & we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the Sinoran Dog. It was bomb!!! Like tick tick. Great place for my wife and I to go to...food is great and the whole menu can be made gluten free"}
{"text":"First time I have ever posted a review on a place but this place made me do it. First time going with my fiance, looked like a chill spot. Sat down inside, kind of cool looking place but theme was a little confusing. Menu was an eyesore with the very different names for simple menu items. We both had a corona, almost not cold enough but not warm enough to complain about. Then we  both ordered carne asada burritos, mine was normal: hers was enchilada style. Server brings only my food out, then soon after hers came out. I take a bite of my burrito and I'm suddenly biting into a breakfast burrito. Server realizes mistake then comes and takes the plate back then has the nerve to go back to other table and grabs my order and tells me she cut it open but didn't take a bite. WHAT?? Why would i want food that has been cut open by someone else? Waited for food even though we were borderline gonna be late for our movie. Her food is now cold but I finally get my \"new\" burrito. So now we're rushed to finish. Both burritos were a little bland, hers was a bit more flavorful with the added sauce. Very Overpriced for quality of food. 15 dollars for a carne asada burrito? with no sides? The music was not good, way too loud, and clashes with the theme in my opinion. And the purpose of the uniform is to make sure the entire business/company looks equal/unified. Make the cook take off his \"du-rag\" and obnoxious hat. Just looks bad. I really hope this place turns it around because there is a glimmer of potential."}
{"text":"I never mind having to wait at Sky Harbor Airport. The restaurants and bars are generally amaizing, except for Sir Vesas. I wanted to have my lunch till after i passed through security. 
C18 is my gate. Although, living in Phoenix affords me great Mexican I have yet to get sick of good Mexican food. So when i ran across Sir Vesas i was excited. I ordered a carne asada salad. Wrong!. It was so disgusting. water on the  bottom, couldn't tell if the meat was chicken or beef. Gross!. I returned it with little push back. Got a fish taco instead. Again... gross! nothing authentic or good about this restaurant.  My advice... avoid it at all costs, the Zinc Brasserias customer service and food was much better."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a bite on 1/22/14 at 3:19PM and ended up ordering one beef and one chicken taco to go.  Both seemed to taste ok but a number of hours later I had a very bad case of food poisoning that lasted about 24 hours.  Anyone that has been sick from food this was about a 7 or 8 on a scale with 10 being the worst.  I'm just not sure which taco it was that got me sick but it was either the chicken or the beef.  Beef and chicken seemed cooked as I recall.

I went the through the airport recently again and asked a shoe shiner about this place and that person suggested that it is known \"not good\" by the people that work in the terminal.  I would avoid."}
{"text":"I had only 1 place in Arizona to really enjoy a chili relleno, it's 3 hours away. I found out today, I only need to drive 5 miles to get an even better relleno!! Also, if you like spicy, get a Cheech and Chong margarita, extra spicy, delicious!!! Martisse will take good care of you, as well as all the staff. Excellent experience!!! My new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great! The bartender was nice. The food was not too good. We just got nachos. The main ingrediant for nachos is cheese and it was horrible. It seemed like cheese whiz, yuk. It is very pricey, which we are ok with but not for cheese whiz. We ate at the bar and I did tell bartender i wash't happy with it. I complimented the shredded beef and guac. She didn't even offer to take a few dollars off b/c we weren't happy with the food. We love outside bars so much!! but sadly we probably won't go back. Just not good customer service. If I am paying 14.00 for nachos and don't like it and they don't care....equates to not going back."}
{"text":"OMG service above everything was awesome. Deena thought of everything for me  She's awesome. That made the food that much better 
Steak Fajitas and Sonoran dogs are incredible"}
{"text":"I love this place. I like that it is family friendly. The service is great. The food is amazing. Everything I've tasted here was delicious. On Saturday nights they have a DJ who always plays great music and makes the atmosphere even more enjoyable. DJ shorty is the best. I will recommend this place to anyone who is looking for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"This restaurant at the Chandler mall has a great outdoor patio. Last night they had a DJ but there was hardly anybody in the restaurant.  I thought the food was good but not great.  Ice cold beer though.  All of the staff were very friendly and service was great."}
{"text":"First time in and experience was awesome! Not only was the food and drinks satisfying our server Meggan was on top of it. She was quick to give suggestions, attentive, and had a great sense of humor. Definitely going to recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Ordered a bean burrito, which says on the menu comes with beans, rice, and cheese. The not so friendly lady taking my order asked if I would like it plain. Unfortunately, my crazy mind assumed plain meant with nothing extra added.  I received my burrito with only beans, so I kindly went up to explain the situation to the girl who took my order. She said \"you said you only wanted beans!\" I replied \"no you asked if I wanted it plain and I replied yes. I'm sorry for the miss understanding, but I'd like it with the rice and cheese please.\"  The cook quickly piped in \"would you like me to make it extra special for him?\"  Horrible, repulsive, inappropriate behavior. Never an apology and the food was ehhh."}
{"text":"5 stars for a few reasons. Awesome beer selection and I have 3 hours to kill. The food is well above average airport fare. If you have some time and need a good beer come here. Gate C12. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Joined a happy hour party here. This place was not my scene. I liked the feel of the restaurant with the big open walls to the outside. It's probably a better place for drinking then food. Had some seriously bad chicken, rubbery. Service replaced it quickly. My peeve is they bring these baby sized cups of chips out and your constantly having to ask for more chips which takes forever. It's not a total loss as a place to go. Drinks and appetizers are a great deal. Food wise there are other excellent Mexican restaurants in the valley better than this place. Still if your with friends and looking for a chill spot it's great for that.   Brett Russo"}
{"text":"To be clear: I did not eat at Sir Veza's The Big Restaurant Attached To The Mall. I ate at Sir Veza's Taco Garage The Place In The Food Court Because I'm Cheap.

I'm not a business analyst, but what it looks like they've done is built their restaurant right next to the food court, so they share a wall, and then carved out one of the food court sections so now it's like the restaurant has a closet that they take orders from and bring you food. You can sit there, in the food court, with the rest of the food court eaters. The food wasn't super fast, which is great because that makes me believe they are making it fresh, and \"ho doggy\" it did seem to be pretty fresh. It wasn't slow either though. I didn't feel like I was sitting around waiting or anything. It took the appropriate amount of time.

I ordered a Sir Noran Hot Dog or something like that. I think the name is supposed to be a play on words because the name of the place starts with 'Sir', but I don't get it. It doesn't really matter though. I'm ok if they want to call it that. Anyway, I ordered it, and it was delicious. If you like hotdogs, you'll either like this, or you're a liar.

The ambiance of the food court in general is a wonderfully grounding experience. One of the things I love about the Chandler Fashion Square Mall is how diverse the shoppers are. You can sit in the food court for an hour, and absolutely make things up, and they'll inevitably walk through the place. Ugly kid on stilts. Totally overweight woman with 3 children. Guy who looks like the monopoly guy. Just any kind of person.

Overall I'm giving Sir Veza's Taco Garage a total of four freakin' stars, because the food was delicious, and the service was great, but compared to the cool taco-garage feel of the counter, going back and sitting in the mall food court means you don't get that full-on Sir Veza's experience. Well then, why did I eat at the food court instead of going to the restaurant? Well I'm not a genius, so I don't know. 4 stars is still really good, so don't worry about it."}
{"text":"Maybe I would rate it four stars if it was outside of the airport, but this is one of my favorite airport restaurants in the United states. Best fish tacos I've ever had, delicious tamales, and yummy churo bites. Definitely my go to place in terminal 4."}
{"text":"The young woman who took my order never smiled and acted like she was in pain. 

My chicken tacos were cold. 

When I requested replacements, the guy was incredibly rude. First, again - no smiling and no apology. He tried to argue with me that the small amount of sauce cooled them down. He realized I wasn't going to argue with him. So I looked up at the menu to remind myself what I didn't want on the tacos, he said to me, \"look at me!\" 

After I got the warm tacos, I told him I thought they should smile some and he wanted to argue again. Nope. 

The food was edible, but you couldn't pay me to eat there again."}
{"text":"very good food,better than I accepted. price of menu items are a little high but they make up for it with large portions. I had the most interesting vegetables in the world as an appetizer which was a mix of green and red peppers, onions, jalapeño, broccoli, and pickles all fried in a tempura batter and served with a side of chipotle ranch! I also ate their carne asada tacos which where also very good. over all I would eat there again!"}
{"text":"Waiting for my Southwest flight. Absolutely delicious and reasonably priced (especially for airport food). Good service and a fun atmosphere. Nothing like a Corona and a veggie bowl to relax before getting on the plane."}
{"text":"Overall our experience at Sir Veza's was very good. The kids actually ate their entire meals, which typically never happens. Kids meals are served in a compartmentalized tray, which is great for mine who don't like their different foods to touch. They have a wide variety of tacos, and I enjoyed each one I ordered - the short rib, the shrimp with sriracha; and the fish. However, I would definitely skip the table-side prepared guacamole for $10 - it was basically four lumpy avocados thrown together with some other minor ingredients mixed in. It was not terrible; just very bland and not worth the price. I liked the ambience of the place with the indoor/outdoor seating; and they had a DJ playing music outside on the patio on Saturday night. Like others have said, service was not great, but it certainly wasn't the worst I've had either...I assume this will get better with time. My family and I will be back to try out some different menu items, and to enjoy another cold MX brew out on the patio."}
{"text":"Let me start with the positive, cheap beer (for airports). It was about $5 for a craft 16oz beer, everywhere else is about $9 bucks. 

The food on the other hand was pretty gross. I got the burrito bowl and it was dry and 95% rice with a few pieces of chicken and a very small amount of sour cream and guac. Been stuck in the airport for much longer than I expected and I decided to try this because of the reasonably priced beer. Next door is the paradise bread (panara bread for socal folks) go there for food, way better food and better prices."}
{"text":"AWESOME doesn't come close! Love the way the girls and guys dress. The food is great especially the Carne Asada Taco's with their beans yummy! They have the tall beer that you can only order if there's 3 of you awesome if there is a group."}
{"text":"Second time here with disappointment.  I've decided to write about it this time.  The counter clerks are gabbing and joking while food is ready from the kitchen, but it just sits there.  

The sliders were as gross as they can get.  The texture was akin to boiled meat.  Maybe grill the meat or finish on an open flame? Duh. 

If you've got a lot of time and not jumping on a flight, I would only then give it a try because you'll likely return your food."}
{"text":"First off let me say I'm usually not one to give a bad review.... But this has to be said.



So I came with my family (mom,dad,sister etc.) It was our first time here. We walk in and it wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. Now the waiter was the main problem. He was maybe 23-25  and he looked like he was a meth addict. He was taking extremely fast, really jumpy, very very paranoid (he was always looking around like someone was following him) and he was always a scratching his wrist. He was nice but he made me extremely uncomfortable. The food was ok it wasn't anything special. Don't think we'll come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've never disagreed with a Yelp rating so much. Maybe people from Phoenix just have justifiably high standards when it comes to Mexican food. Maybe it's a service thing (although my service was great). Who knows. What I do know is that this place is super tasty and very reasonably priced. I got the chicken burrito for $10 and it's some of the best airport food I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and come in if you have a layover at PHX!"}
{"text":"Honestly not that great of a place. Have not tasted the food but the drinks were not good. My suggestion is to go to kona right next door."}
{"text":"We want to give a BIG shout out to Marcus, we stopped in for some fish tacos and a fee beers after shopping and he was such an awesome server. We will come back since we received such great customer service from him. You Rock Marcus !

{"text":"I had 2 Tacos... Beef and Chicken. Beef was ok... But the chicken and avocado combo really was amazing. Presentation and the decor is interesting.... Built like a garage as the name suggests. Music is fun and funky. Good place to hang out...."}
{"text":"Good tacos and drinks. I come here almost every time I'm in town. Nothing fussy - just solid."}
{"text":"Service needs some work for sure! Tacos are okay nothing to rave about. The best thing about Sir vezas are the nachos, ceviche and drinks!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best \"garage\" ever!  
Most of the staff is incredibly friendly and welcome you as you walk past. 

Decor is all moto... Shop rags for napkins, wheels for the base to booths, drop-light lighting, wrench chandelier, truck and motorcycle parts on the walls & ceilings, side mirror collage over sink basin, and the list goes on.  So very creative.    
Big screen TVs everywhere for the sports fans.   
The food is a mixed lot.  
First visit we ordered nachos... Thankfully only one order as they serve a HUGE amount.  (Seriously 1/4 sheet cake piled high). We chose the pork with prickly pear salsa and the meat was melt in your mouth perfection.   

Second visit I had the best hamburger that I've eaten in years.   No bun, but they do offer Gluten Free buns. Woohoo! Drag strip chicken was pretty good, dredged in corn flour, no wheat!!  Hubby had chimi, again like the nachos, the portion is HUGE.  ( good for a big dude )

The fries were undercooked and a little cold, but have potential.   

They were out of their \"special\" (cannot remember what it was that day).  Good thing they have plenty to choose from.   And GLUTEN FREE options.  Which is good for those of is with intolerance or mild allergies.   I hope they are successful and stay!!!"}
{"text":"Great food their table side guacamole  is really good as well as the tacos. We come here quite often and our server joe is always Great! They also have some of the best micheladas."}
{"text":"Best sports bar/ restaurant in Chandler. Great TVs with volume for events. They play great music and have live music as well. The food is absolutely awesome also very good variety. They also have the best Happy Hour in town. My friends and I now have a new place to have fun and enjoy great food and taste lots of crafty beers."}
{"text":"Loved the idea of a garage restaurant.  We stopped in for lunch after shopping for hours. We got the T bucket sampler: it did come in a bucket, but everything in it was fried-which made it all taste the same.  Watching other things come out of the kitchen-their portions are large.  We Really loved the chips and salsa, but not sure if that's enough to come back for."}
{"text":"Sliders were crap... Tamale was dry and lacking flavor and the waitress was one of the rudest people Ive ever encountered at an airport"}
{"text":"I've had two meals here, both were tasty. They clearly label their menu indicating gluten-free options. As GF people know, most Mexican food is naturally GF.  But it's nice to know that the kitchen is attempting to eliminate contamination. The location is right next door to Cartel Coffee by the high C gates. They have a seating area and a TV. Carry out business is pretty quick. The salsa comes on the side in containers, red and green. Burrito bowl was flavorful and a good portion size for me."}
{"text":"Meh...
Their quest takes like nacho cheese sauce you get at the ball park.  
The chimi bites had the same cheese sauce in them, but with green chiles added.  
And I'm not even a picky eater.  But they should market more towards a Wendy's or Burger King patron"}
{"text":"I have written about this place once before and the second time we went almost a year later is NO better.....
Waitress sara greeted us, it took another 10 minutes to take our order and she was no where to be found. Don't know the guys name but he deserves 5 stars and he took our order, made our apetizer made sure our food came out right and had to catch a ride. We tipped him. Manager asked if food was ok and before I or my husband or friend could ask anything, basically ran away. She asked if we needed anything else, we said boxes and the check please. She brought boxes and asked if we wanted dessert. I'm a server myself, I know the deal, if I ask for a check it usually means I don't want dessert. We asked for the check a SECOND  time and she comes back saying \"I don't know what you ordered since I didn't take your order so how do you want me to split it\". 
Seriously, in my 11 years of serving I have never, NEVER, said that to a table.....
Also to include the last time we were there the manager told the server that if she wanted an amount taken off the bill SHE WOULD HAVE TO PUT HER OWN HARD WON TIPS TOWARDS IT EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T HER FAULT THAT OUR FOOD CAME OUT AT DIFFERENT TIMES ALONG WITH OUR APETIZER COMING OUT THE SAME TIME AS OUR BILL! 
This place pissed me off again and I will never go back unless they hire ppl who are willing to work and actually make sure their tables are ok."}
{"text":"Yumm! We had the shrimp diablo taco (hubby said it's a definite repeat next visit) - I enjoyed the grilled fish & grilled chicken tacos... drinks were excellent (& BIG!) - great service & comfy outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Food was terrible.  Hostess had a bit of an attitude.   Our Server was nice.   Drinks were ok.   We won't be going again."}
{"text":"Reliable food typically overpriced. Don't expect any of the servers to go above and beyond to make you a satisfied customer. If you're good with the minimum work they'll do, definitely stop here to help a rumbling tummy."}
{"text":"Stopped here unexpectedly while shopping. 11:50 am with only 1 other table seated, (oh No). Like some other reviews outdoor furniture in rags, not very warm welcome. But it was Tuesday 1/2 price tacos, so why not. Our food arrived very quick and was actually very good, the chicken and beef tacos very moist. Large portions, the server actually warmed up to us after our meal casually visiting with us??? I would try again."}
{"text":"Meggan and Nate had wonderful service! :) they were very prompt and our meal was delish! It's our favorite place for Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Absolutly discusting. Way over priced even for airport food. Staff was not very friendly and where just kind of hanging out.. Seating is tight and does not allow for any dinning enjoyment.. Had chicken quesadilli and chicken was hard and rubbery probably from being over cooked.. Choices are limited in this terminal, so if you have time maybe explore others.. Better yet, stop at subway and grab a sandwich for your bag.."}
{"text":"I needed a good breakfast while waiting for my flight. Enter Sir Vesa's! The breakfast tacos and breakfast scramble hit the spot. It wasn't fancy, but the no-nonsense breakfast is exactly what I needed. I'll remember this place the next time I'm in Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"First time here and HOLY HOT DAAAMMM!! This place Rocks! It has a car garage character, and I'm a car guy so thumbs up. The original plan was to just to shop around in the mall real quick, and decided to have a quick beer since I was Hangry. 

Then guess what?  Ordered one drink called the Sirchelada. Don't know what it is? Come try it. Well one great drink led to another, you know how it goes. Then for the snacks. Rocket edamame sure is fire. Lift off.

This was a short trip but definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"It's so rare to get good airport food. My fish tacos here were delicious. Perfect portion and tasted so fresh. My husband had the nachos and he was happy too. Plus the fountain drinks are free refills and the staff were super nice!"}
{"text":"I'm accustomed to airport food being expensive, but even by that standard this was disappointing for a $14 chopped salad."}
{"text":"Good music, great atmosphere, and our waiter was very sociable. They have a vegan option on the menu which is always nice. I ordered the chicken burrito and a mixed berry margarita which were both delish."}
{"text":"Decent burrito, for an airport. Barbacoa was actually pretty tasty but the size left me wanting more to eat."}
{"text":"We had went there this evening, we sat on the patio area(for 2 hours), me, my husband and daughter, first I would like to say this used to be our favorite place to go to, as of tonight I would like to say I don't think we are going back, we didn't have the greatest service, we walked in thru the patio area, a waitress \"asked us if we wanted a few menus\" as we were already seated(which was nice of her). Our server came and took our order, she was nice, brought us water, I did assume that they stopped serving chips and salsa as we did not get any with our water like we used to get when we used to go before, but then I saw every table around us that got them, even the people at the bar. My husband ordered the Street Corn, without Tajin on it, he doesn't like tajin, (the server that asked us if we wanted menus is the one that ended up bringing my husbands corn out to him, and it had tajin, he told her that he did order it without it, she grabbed it, and said oh ok, we can get you a new one, which was nice, but then walked away and rolled her eyes, she was kind of a snob) we could of done without the eye rolling, not my fault she doesn't like her job, it would of been a little better. Also when we order beer a tall one, you might as well order a regular one, all the beers for some reason we're at least 2-2 1/2 inches away from being full from the top of the glass, why is that. My Nachos, that's another story, I don't know where I've ever gone some where and had cold Nachos where the cheese was not melted? Here's a tip, you guys should put the meat beans and cheese on them and broil them and then out the other toppings on, that's just an idea, and less water in the pico and warm the meat up too please. My Sir Chelada was good like always. But this time was a disappointment overall."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant with reservations, since there were mixed reviews. We are pretty hard to please and we were pleasantly surprised by our experience.  I feel like this restaurant hasn't been given enough credit.  

We arrived mid-day on a Sunday after a few hours of shopping.  The beer was cold and the wine was nice.  The chips and salsa was very flavorful and great to take the edge off our hunger.  Our waitress was very helpful and friendly and recommended the tacos to us.  

My husband had the cerveza battered fish, the shredded beef and diablo shrimp tacos along with rice and beans.  He had both corn and flour tortillas.  The tacos were very generous in size and they used two tortillas per taco (they were smaller).  The flavor was very good for each of the proteins and cooked well.  I had the diablo shrimp and shredded chicken on a lettuce wraps, which was a nice option for a person who likes to each low carb and watches their macros.  

Overall, the place had a fun atmosphere, the service was good and the food was flavorful. We would come here again and recommend that people give it a try!"}
{"text":"Needed to grab something eat before I hopped on my flight but wanted something other than pizza or a pre-wrapped sandwich. Stumbled upon this little place and ordered the Chicken & Bacon Quesadilla. Great flavor and the perfect size. Came with just the right amount of guacamole. Overpriced but that's what you get when ordering food in the airport. Definitely would come back next time I'm in Phoenix's airport."}
{"text":"I've never written a yelp review but I feel this place needs to hear it as a former bartender and waitress I get sometimes you get busy but this was pure laziness.  I wanted to come for a celebration with family and friends and everything was HORRIBLE and made the night not what you want for celebrating. 1st the hostess with a huge attitude and extremely RUDE didn't have my reservation for 15 people but luckily there was plenty of space on the patio. After we finally got seated it took me after about 15-20 minutes of patiently waiting to get up and ask a sever if we could get service.  
     2 of the 3 people that chose to order food never got it because the order was never put in.  I had to constantly find our server to keep drinks full, remind them what they forgot or ask for it to be made how we ordered it,  at one point I ran my own drinks from the bar that sat there for a good 10 minutes while the \"manager\" was behind the bar just washing dishes. While I also watched my 2 servers standing by the POS stations .. 
     Lastly my bf and I sat down at the bar after everyone else left to have a drink together n couldn't get acknowledged yet alone service so we went over to BJS n got great friendly service..  Compltely ruined my experience and celebration. I've been here before and had bad service like this but just chalked it up to its a new place they need time, well this was the last time I or anyone of the 15 people who came to Sir Vezas last night will be back or spend our money there. I hope they find good help that cares and knows what they are doing.."}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos are the best ever! Great atmosphere and excellent service! Love the outside seating!"}
{"text":"This is one of those \"if I could give it 0 stars...\" reviews. To Cruella, or whatever your name was, it's not my fault the girl that took my order told me I could get the sliders wrapped in lettuce (instead of a bun). I even got charged for extra lettuce. I waited patiently for my food, got called up, and was given a burrito. 

When I explained what I ordered, this extremely rude Phoenician said, in a snotty tone, \"We don't make that.\" Uh, well perhaps you should tell the girl that took my order at YOUR \"restaurant.\" She talked to me like it was my fault I dared order that. She then tersely says, \"Do you want to order something else or do you want a refund?\" I was like, \"Hey, stop flirting, you're making me blush!\" No, not really.

So I said to just do the sliders with the buns. She was multitasking spreading her sunshine to others, so I'm not sure if she heard me. She then walks away for 5-10 seconds, just leaving me at the counter alone. She finally comes back and says, \"What do you want to do?\" I'm thinking, \"I'd like to recommend a career change, for one. It's not my fault you probably go to Arizona State and work at the airport in food service. How about something where you can scare children or don't have to deal with customers, like bomb diffuser. I think some Phoenix passengers would appreciate that.\" But I digress.

She was really rude. I went to McDonald's and got a lettuce wrapped QPC and it was delicious for half the price."}
{"text":"We were out shopping at the mall and decided to stop in here for an early dinner. We came during happy hour, so of course my hubby had to try a margarita! It was a blackberry margarita and it was very tasty (I had more than one sip lol) 

My daughter ordered the kids burger which was decent, and my hubby and I shared the nachos. They were HUGE! Plenty of food for two people to share as a meal. The nachos were very good, but not the best I have ever had.

The best part of our meal was our server, De. She was super friendly, knowledgeable, engaging, and speedy! All the things I like in a good server. 

We will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"A little high on the price but worth it. I've been here twice. First time I had a burger and fries. Outstanding! Second visit was boneless wings with diabolo sauce. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"It's not the worst option for fast food style airport food. They have veggie tacos that provide reasonable portions and nice scoops of guacamole. The rice is awful and the salsa is more like pizza sauce. Although it's affordable and quick."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I have been here three times now with the boyfriend and family and everyone loves it! They have a great beer selection and the service is always good, the waiters aren't in your face too much or not enough it's the perfect amount & of course the atmosphere is great too! Highly recommend the Sonoran Dog, it's presentation is on point and super filling! I've gotten both their tacos and shredded beef burrito (fully loaded) and never been disappointed! Would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Tried Sir Veza's this evening with my husband.  The staff was very nice and accommodating.  The food was great-i did not get what I ordered,  but it was still awesome.  I ordered the club taco and the Diablo chicken taco,  and I got  a plain chicken taco and a Diablo shrimp taco.  Both were really good though,  and I didn't even mention it to the waitress.  

We also had the Margarita of the month that has coconut in it,  which was delicious!!  

The food was a little slow to come out,  especially for a Thursday,  but thankfully we weren't in any hurries.  

Overall,  it was good food and drink.  I would absolutely give them another try"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed when I arrived at the garage today. I went to order the Prickly Pear BBQ tacos that I am in love with...only to find out that they don't have them anymore.  My server, Bobby, went up and above the call of duty to get the kitchen to make them for me. I will definitely be back because of him! He's also super hot, so that's a plus!!"}
{"text":"Whoever designed this place should be institutionalized. Every space is so narrow that a single person blocks it off, let alone when they're dragging along children with their own bags. There's so few surfaces on which you can lay down your meal that people were literally eating over garbage cans. I had to sit there and wait, being pushed and bumped around like a buoy, as the stench of putrefying tacos wafted out of everywhere.

The salad, much to my surprise, had potential. The combination of ingredients was great, but completely spoiled by a dressing that tasted like a melted lemon-lime popsicle."}
{"text":"Horrible food and wayyyyyy overpriced, even for an airport. Horrible customer service. All the employees seemed angry. The guacamole was God awful!"}
{"text":"I tried the car club chicken tacos with corn tortillas and it was amazing! They were bigger than I expected them to be for being corn tortillas. We went back for taco Tuesday and got the 2 dollar happy hour tacos. They are pretty small but good. It was a nice surprise to see four peaks peach ale on tap since usually places only have kilt lifter. I will be back for sure. Nice to have this place close by."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Diablo shrimp tacos from here, I mean seriously I crave them. Anyway my wife and I came by yesterday for a lunch date and both ordered 3 tacos, she ordered Nana's chicken, carnitas and carne asada tacos. The Nanas chicken taco was amazing, the other 2 were good as well, but the chicken was far and away her favorite. I ordered the Diablo shrimp, the vegetarian taco, and the chicken club taco. The Diablo shrimp was super delicious as always, sweet and spicy, with shrimp that are crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside. The vegetarian taco was actually a bit of a surprise in how good it actually was. Super fresh tasting, with an awesome garlicky cream sauce and crispy fried avocado it's going to become a regularly ordered item for me. The chicken club however was just blah to be honest, nothing bad about it, it just didn't impress the way the other two tacos did. We really enjoyed our food, but as others have said, the service was definitely lacking. It took our server 15 mins AFTER we had gotten our margaritas to offer us water as well, and she didn't check in after we had gotten our food, she was no where to be found when we were ready for the check, and it really wasn't busy...we were one of 5 families at the restaurant. But otherwise the food was great as usual!"}
{"text":"We had such high hope for this place based on the beer list and the menu but . . . Epic fail. The bland appetizers were served by a visibly sick waiter, the beer we wanted was unavailable, and the service was. . . Very . . . Slow. Fortunately, there are a lot of great places in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"Went for the company and I stayed for the food. 

We started with the guacamole and had the server be the \"diver\" (her term not mine). Most times they drop off the guac fixins and the table makes it to their taste. Overall the freshness was on point and it tasted good. 

For my entree I ordered the shrimp enchiladas. I tired to stop eating it half way through.....I even put my sour cream side cup in the middle of the dish in hopes they would take it.....moral of the story is good food won. I ate every bite. 

We did have to ask for more chips and salsa on multiple occasions. It wasn't the best Mexican food I had in AZ but it was good considering it was attached to a mall."}
{"text":"Not bad in fact good. Great service at the bar. Good food, excellent beer selection. I enjoyed the time there with a beer and quesadillas - enjoyable. Keep it up a welcome addition to sky harbor"}
{"text":"This spot was 15 feet away from the gate and I wanted a burger.
I ordered the two sliders with fries. It was reasonably priced at $10. 
The first thing I noticed was the burger meat was not made fresh. Even though it was good, I could tell that it was not made when I ordered it and when I opened up my container there were only about 14 french fries, I expected more. Even though I got gypped on the french fries, they were really good. Perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper."}
{"text":"I ordered:
-two beef Tomales
- their *world famous* sirnoran dog(which I had a feeling was a marketing ploy)
-and a pumpkin tomale (we were lucky to get this seasonal item).

The beef Tomales were sub pare, the flavor just wasn't there in a the masa.
The sirnoran dog was a let down the flavors didn't work, the old school fries that came with it tasted like they were in the freezer for to long, the pepper was good though.
The pumpkin tomale was a steamed pumpkin pie filling in masa wi th whipped cream, it turned out to be pretty good and was the only saving grace.  Don't think I'll  eat here agian."}
{"text":"The food was good for what it was the atmosphere of the restaurant was good. We didn't get service for like twenty minutes when we got up to leave the host was very concerned got us service and the waitress on her second day was amazing she made up for the wait and helped us was cheerful kind and the staff made for a good experience. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Our first time here at Sir Veza's and we had a great experience. Our waitor Joe was friendly and helpful! He recommended the lunch special, different types of specials and spicy mango margarita! Everything was delicious! He was very thoughtful that he even packed our food to-go and iced cold water! We are definitely coming back for the food and great customer service."}
{"text":"I got a vegetarian bowl, it was simple but actually pretty tasty. I'm giving them 2 stars because I hate styrofoam, and I think it's especially inappropriate if you're going to sell a \"bowl.\" Styrofoam is toxic to us and the planet. If they rectify this they'd getmore stars from me, but I will never return to a restaurant that serves me in styrofoam."}
{"text":"Over the top great service!  We received excellent service while eating dinner here on a Monday night.  The food was great and the drinks were outstanding.  

The service

It is nice to eat a restaurant and have a server who knows about the menu and what it tastes like.  We got great info when placing our drink order and then our food order.  We never waited a minute if we needed something.  The chips and salsa were replaced when they got low.    

The atmosphere 

We ate outside under the large mall entry way covering.  It was comfortable and was good for people watching in the background.  I did mention we ate here on a Monday night and the large screen television allowed us to watch some of the game(even though we both didn't like the teams playing LOL)  

The food

I went with a 3 taco plate and tried 3 different tacos.  It was served with beans and rice.  All three were good and my favorite was the diablo shrimp taco.  My wife had the grilled chicken enchilada flat.  We both thought the food was very great.  I was just able to \"just' finish everything on my plate and my wife wasn't.  We both left full!  

Overall

Having been to the Tucson locations this new one in Chandler is on par with the others.  I had a great tasting margarita and enjoyed the chips and salsa while waiting for our food.  When the food arrived it tasted great.  The automotive garage theme they have going on works.  Outside dining and the ability to watch the game worked.  With the amount of quality food and drink we got the price worked.  If you find yourself wanting Mexican food while at the mall give it a try.  It will not be the typical mall fast food and the quality here will be much better!"}
{"text":"Good flavored tacos at a fair price for a airport food court. Fast service and a good selection of beer on tap."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly.  Ordered the Burrito bowl.  Ugh.  Seriously gross.  I LOV E  Mexican food and will eat ANYTHING.  This was just bad.  Granted, a bit late at night but please do not scrape up the crusty rice that has been in the pot all day and add it to the meal - and sauce wayyy too salty.  But hey, there are no options.  If you have an option, take the drinks, skip the food."}
{"text":"I was at the mall and it was unbelievable! The fries are amazing!! They were fried mash potatoes! This place better make it cuz this place is way better than kona grill! The atmosphere was cute and unique and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"As a usual customer of sir vezas, I am very disappointed in my experience today. The bar was extremely under-staffed with only one girl running the entire bar area and making all of the drinks for the entire restaurant. It took 40 minutes for us to get our drink order and our appetizer was completely forgotten about. I hate to stop going to a place after one bad experience but today was too much. The only reason we would consider returning is for our usual good experiences with the bartender with pink hair, she is so awesome and they need more of her in this place."}
{"text":"I love this place and look forward to lay overs at Sky Harbor just so I can get some Mini Chimi Bites and then there is the staff, they're great.  Today was no exception. Fallon was super nice and made sure my stop was excellent. Good food, good service and good prices what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We got the chips and queso!
And we got the guacamole and chips!
Sounds great right?!?!
Nope...
Never again!
$15.00 later we got 2 boxes of chips, a tiny salsa cup of guac and nacho cheese drizzled on our chips. 
Way to swindle your customers SirVeza's!"}
{"text":"Hours are not correct. They stop serving food much earlier. Called to find them the never said anything about kitchen being closed. Finally got there and they don't server food."}
{"text":"Best patio I've been to in a long time. Weather was perfect, company was wonderful, food was awesome and service was great. We spent several hours just hanging out, drinks, appetizer, lunch, dessert. Colby, our waitress was a perfect hostess even with all the special requests we made. We plan to make this a regular weds lunch spot. Their nearly endless list of taco recipes, and the amount of beers they offer was inexhaustible. Yep, love this place!"}
{"text":"So,  we habe been here once before when it very 1st opened. I was relatively uncomfortable at that visit as all the servers looked like strippers, and can't remember much of the food...HOWEVER,I wanted to give it another chance,  and this time was different! All the servers were dressed and of different body types! The food was delicious.  Hubby got the shredded beef bowl,  and I tried a bowl as well! Yum,  and plenty left over. They have a great kids menu too! We used the check-in offer for a pumpkin tamales, but they were out so they substituted it with fried ice cream which comes with churros! Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"grilled fish tacos with shredded cabbage were quite good, for food in an airport.."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is amazing! This is exactly how food should be made. The nachos with pork and prickly pear sauce are incredible."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was very good. My girlfriend and I will definitely come back, our server Katie was awesome and very helpful with what is good here. We had the T-Bucket sampler bucket was more then enough food for the two of us. The restaurant was decorated very nice and it was very clean."}
{"text":"The Sonoran hot dog was okay however mine was on the weak and empty side... see my picture. Hardly worth $10 for this... go get a real Sonoran hot dog for less that is more fulfilling.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos I've ever had in my life! The Diablo shrimp is the greatest thing ever!!! I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Matt was great! Stopped for a cold one and some jams !!! Recommend for a hang  out with friends on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This place was pretty terrible. Only went because we had a groupon, server did a good job but the food was terrible. They had a DJ at 4 in the afternoon on a week day, it was just all around bad. Perhaps a better option for the younger crowd that needs to feel like they are in a night club. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in while waiting for a flight.  Initially it was packed but luckily everyone's flight must have been leaving at the same time and cleared out in time for me to get a seat at the bar.  I ordered the chicken burrito bowl which consists of black beans, sv rice, queso casero, bowls guacamole, roasted corn, pico salsa.  Very tasty, light enough that I didn't feel sleepy after I ate it.  They serve mixed drinks in the \"red\" cup that you see at most parties, just to give you that additional \"garage\" theme feel.  Bill aka Preston is a funny and well engaging bartender!  They should give this guy a raise!  So quick, thorough and attentive I love it!"}
{"text":"Stopped here today for a quick lunch during a 2-hour layover at PHX. I got a grilled chicken taco on a flour tortilla, minus the queso and beans, and a shredded beef taco on a corn tortilla. I had figured the corn one would be a hard shell but it was actually soft shell. 

The tacos were pretty good, a little pricey (around $11-12) but that's typical for airport food. It has a limited seating area but I found a seat at the bar, there are a few tables to sit at as well."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the food tasted fair. Although, the portion to price was offensive at best. I felt compelled to speak to the manager hoping that there was a mistake. When I she treated me like the fool who just got duped and there wasn't a thing she was about to do about it. Nice managerial skills. Then, while my family was still eating, a server came up to our tiny table and dropped off the condiment bucket that we had removed to accommodate our meals and said \"Be sure to put back the condiments when you are done!\" She didn't even ask us the cursory, \"How's everything?\"
OFFENSIVE--RIP OFF--RUDE.
Save yourself the abuse and go elsewhere. Good luck, descent people."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday special is amazing, and our server was great. The food was delicious, but the sangria was terrible.  A regular lite beer would have been a better option at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I give this place no stars really we waited at door for a long time to be seated.  The hostess was very nice when she did get there.  We sat for at least 10 minutes before we got up and walked out.  Five severs came around us none of them even offered us water or looked at us sad service.  We just went to BJs down the way where their costumer service is wonderful.  So much for trying someplace new :("}
{"text":"Just opened up at the Chandler mall, you'll find this sports bar at the food court entrance.

The menu is written in car jargon and difficult to understand,  but our server was polite and helped explain the different items. Food and drinks were over priced. The happy hour specials are closer to normal prices.

Seating was...interesting. The dining area is mostly outside and set up like a bar rather than a restaurant. There is also a 'lounge' area with cushioned benches and coffee tables. At the dining tables, you get either a bench seat, stool, or horribly uncomfortable chair. I had to swap out my chair for a stool shortly after being seated, and I noticed another lady also opting for a different seat.

I have to say, after seeing the high prices I was prepared to dislike this place, but we really got our value for the food we ordered. Three of us shared a full order of nachos with chicken, and it was super huge and we all loved it. Just for the nachos, I would come here again. Seriously, this thing was served on a baker's 1/4 sheet and was 8\" high!!

Service was a mixed experience but mostly good. At one point I went inside for something I needed. I surely had an I-need-help look on my face but thought there were employees everywhere,  they were so focused on watching the game on TV I had trouble getting someone's attention. In a few minutes I got sorted out and went back to the mountain of nachos at my table.

Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Food: we got the Carne Asada burrito - fully loaded (rated 3 stars... It was OK... Nothing special) and the Diablo Shrimp bowl (4 stars)... The Diablo shrimp is kind of like an orange chicken I would say (a little spicy, but also sweet). 

Service: not the best - I had asked for more salsa before our food came and she never brought it out then I needed a knife for my bowl (our waitress didn't bring our food) so I waited a few minutes before getting up and finding her to ask for a knife and the salsa. 

I do love the gluten free options here. They really cater to that, it seems, and the servers are well-informed, which is great. They said the chips have a dedicated fryer (not fried with the cerveza-battered fish, etc.) and I haven't gotten a reaction yet so crossing my fingers on r"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in a while, and I recently ate at a Chili's. It started out okay we got seated quickly but that's the only kind thing I can say. Our waitress disappeared so often we had to ask two other people to look for her. And then had to wait 15 more minutes before she showed. She brought us the wrong drink and after offering to discount it, the manager came and told is he couldn't, we let it go just so we could get out of there. The appetizer was terrible and we would've tried something else except, you guessed it, our waitress had vanished into the ether. It's not worth sweating your ass off in steel seating. Trust me."}
{"text":"Ladies margaritas $1 on Mondays! They definitely have the best happy hour in town! Love this place!"}
{"text":"We visited a few weeks ago.  My daughter ordered a kid's meal, which was actually served on a school lunch tray and was just as flavorful.  My husband ordered 2 street tacos which were greasy (they had been grilled with cheese unlike most street tacos) and served with mediocre sides of black beans and rice.  My meal was the most tolerable, but only because I requested no cheese or dairy of any kind.  I had to wait longer as they remade my meal, because they made a mistake and originally put cheese on it.  I also had a margarita, which was watered down.

Given the poor food quality, I don't expect this restaurant to last much longer than others that have been at the spot.  But if you are at the mall and looking for \"Mexican\" food, I suggest Rubio's - it's much better than this place."}
{"text":"I felt like I was eating Mexican food in Kansas.  The salsa was straight out of a jar, and nothing else was any better, including the lousy $10.00 margarita!"}
{"text":"I'm racing through the airport starving and hoping not to miss my flight.  For one time in my life I was happy my flight was delayed.  I had an extra hour and stumbled across this place. I ordered the carne asada burrito no rice, I honestly was expecting a not so good burrito because I'm in an airport.  I was wrong!  This place was fast, friendly and the meat in the burrito was amazing.  I ordered with hot sauce and it was kind of weak.  But overall really good quick food."}
{"text":"Worst bar concept ever.  No matter what drink you order be prepared for it to come in a plastic red cup. The gimmick is wasteful and pointless.  The bar doesn't provide for recycling even though the hundreds of plastic cups it throws out everyday are marked for recycling.  This place needs to get over the \"red cup\" trend and get into the now.  Very disappointed in the cliche.  Thankfully there are a couple other more respectable bars just a five minute walk away."}
{"text":"Great Micheladas and Bloody Marys.  Tacos are a solid 10 and portions are not skimpy! Great atmosphere and staff was great.  Definitely one of my favorites in Chandler."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced burritos that are small in size & have hardly any filling in them. $12 Carne Asada burrito that was mostly filled with black beans. It would take two burritos to constitute a meal. Complete rip-off, even for airport price-gouging."}
{"text":"Even if this wasn't airport food, this place would be pretty good.  Think of it as a more expensive chipotle (minus the E. coli).  I got the shredded beef bowl for $10 and was pleasantly surprised.  Also, guac is included, so kudos for that.  Wait time was also shorter than most other airport options.  We were lucky enough to snag a seat, but tables are limited."}
{"text":"I tried this place at the Phoenix Airport.  I ordered the Veggie Bowl; imagine my surprise when the only veggie was one very small slice of onion - I'm serious - that was it!  Approximately 10% of the rice was so hard it was not chew-able.  I'll never eat there again."}
{"text":"I don't have a whole lot of expectations from airport restaurants but serving raw fish would still catch me off guard. The fish was not properly thawed and was tasteless on top of being raw."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the burritos here. It's great place to grab a bite inbetween flights. The burritos are always fresh tasting and delicious. You choice your filling and they do the rest. The salsa is really good here too. 

The service is quick, friendly, and efficient and you can also order a beer here too, winning...

The seating can be tricky, as there is not much. However, with all patrons on the go, be patient, wait a few minutes, a table will most likely open up for you soon. There is also a counter to stand at to enjoy your meal here too, just another option. 

I will keep coming back, you bet."}
{"text":"Delicious burritos bowls and burgers, great drinks, Paleo and GF friendly! Well worth checking out."}
{"text":"I've searched long and hard to find good beer in terminal 4.  Santan Hopshock on tap, Four Peaks Hop Knot in cans, Sleepy Dog on tap.  Awesome!  And not 9 dollars!    4 stars because without having the food I can't give 5."}
{"text":"Food was great.  I had chicken tacos, custom to my preferences.  It's a cramped restaurant so if you are just eating...go somewhere else. Michael is behind the bar and though I was not drinking he was still there for service.  Plus he's suprr personable and a nice guy. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"So this is the 2nd time I've been here and while the first time had mediocre service, our waiter Matthew was ON POINT. We never had an empty beer, empty chip or salsa bowl. The food was great but the service was even better, Matthew was attentive and courteous, his walk by and thumbs up or down was perfect to keep the ambiance flowing (interrupting yet totally not!). Thank you for he amazing service Matthew, will totally come back and ask for you!!"}
{"text":"Not much to say except for almost no flavor chicken with edible black beans and pretty fluffy edible rice. The veg and onions are way too soft, almost mushy. The guac is edible and the pico de gallo did not look fresh. They also give you a side of spicy salsa that's full with preservatives. 

Edible when you're on a bind."}
{"text":"My friends and I love the happy hour discounts on the 120 oz beer towers of bluemoon for $29 and any others for less! The burgers are amazing! and especially the t bucket sampler, ever need a fun place in chandler to hangout at? come to this location at chandler mall the whole staff and even the general manager does a great job at making this place one of the best bars and insuring the best atmospheres!"}
{"text":"Good food especially for an airport. Really pleased with Sky Harbor additions of Chelsea's Kitchen and Sauce. But for food next to the gate this is a viable option. Good bacon and egg breakfast tacos as well as chicken tacos for lunch. Give it a try. Cartel coffee next door also."}
{"text":"Also used a living social deal.  Great place, beautiful pation, great food, and awesome day time bartender!"}
{"text":"This place is new in the dreaded location at the south main entrance to Chandler Fashion Square.  I say \"dreaded\" because every restaurant here has gone out of business for some reason even though the location is ideal for a restaurant.  I think Sir Veza's might be number 4 or 5 since 2001?  I'm not sure why the others failed.  But I digress!!!

The remodel looks great.  Very open with good TV viewing everywhere, and a nice indoor/outdoor seating arrangement.  The staff was Fantastic!  They truly acted like they wanted to be there.  Our server \"Fire\" was on fire with his service and attitude.  Really nice guy that cared about the place and the customers.

I ordered the 2 taco combo.  They were fantastic and nicely done.  They have an interesting approach to \"glueing\" two corn tortillas together with cheese to make a bigger taco.   Loved the chips and sides too (charro beans and rice).  Also you could get a \"protein style\" taco wrapped in lettuce for you low carb types.  I wish they put cheese in those though. (they didn't with my S.O.'s lettuce-wrap taco)

Fire mentioned that they also cater to gluten free people so that's great and unusual for a Mexican joint.

The margaritas were great too, btw!

The only down sides:  

1.  I'd like to see a way to order tacos a la carte though so I could get more taco and no sides.  
2.  The prices are high for the amount of food you get.  $12 for two tacos and beans and rice, and $15 for three tacos and beans and rice.  Ouch!   This could seriously stop many folks from coming back even though they love the food, IMO.

Suggestions:
1.  Add taco take-out at the food-court window.  You can only get hotdogs or something like that now."}
{"text":"My new fave Mexican joint & I don't say this without several different dishes under my belt (pun intended). It figures this place is owned by the same family as the iconic El Charro in Tucson. Every dish from the tacos to the apple chimi is flavor filled & presented in awe inspiring splendor. My gal & I can recommend the SirNoran dog, the Diablo shrimp tacos, the fajitas (not your average)   Save room for dessert as the apple chimichanga is amazing & unique. The drink menu is just as creative & tasty as the food. The outdoor patio is great place to enjoy all this great fare. Ole"}
{"text":"Surprisingly the night life at sir vezas on a Friday night was pretty cool for being connected to the mall you'd think they couldn't play the music they had bumping by a decent dj my last minute decision to have drinks with friends turned out to be a great way to end my day... open til midnight and music was so good. Drinks on the happy hour menu were eh.. which makes it 4 outta 5 stars for me. But the SirCerveza-Rita a margarita with coronita was just like the menu said, Bomb"}
{"text":"Here today and was treated so rude by a 40 something male bartender. 

What an idiot. Why are people mean?  There was not reason to be rude you could tell that he was often rude to people as other employee had their heads down. He was some type of manager probably sad about how his life turned out so he treats people rude because there is nowhere else to go in the airport. 

If you can avoid it do not go here"}
{"text":"This location must be under new management. The menu is a little different. We got our tacos with no meat in them and one had French fries or something in them as of the kitchen was a mess. We finally got the food runner to acknowledge us and take it back. She brought back our tacos with meat slopped in it and the tortillas were cold and getting hard. This place was amazing prior to this possible new management or the Sunday kitchen staff sucks which all the staff should be on the same standard. I will try this place one more time until I tell it to fuck off."}
{"text":"You hear that siren?!  We got a quality weiner alert in the desert!  YesSir Veza's thank you for offering a Sonoran dog that I would actually recommend to out of towners.  And it's also a good place to watch all the televised games on college Fball Saturday or NFL Sundays!

What grabbed my attention always walking past the food court was their Sirnoran Hot Dog had a 100% angus all beef hot dog.  I shoved it down my pie hole and enjoyed every bite!  Oh of course there's the onion rings....beer battered but batter fell apart on a few so perhaps I would pass next time but they were A-OK.  

Yes I know there are other places around town that serve the Sonoran Dog BUT well let's just say they all looked down at the floor when I ask about what kind of weiners they use!  Yea uh huh sure that's right go ahead and shove that craptastic junkified Oscar Mayer ding dong up your hoo hah where the sun don't shine!  

There was a time when \"Back in the Days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore but some days I wish I was a kid again\" I could care less about what's in my hot diggity dog and would only focus on taste and flava only.  Welp the name Sirnoran Dog is well deserved cause I crushed it like a Sir, like a gentleman, like a boss yessirey indeedy!  I'll be back for HH specials!"}
{"text":"Monday around 6, seated on the patio quickly. Got our order taken quickly and the food came out within a reasonable amount of time. We got fish tacos, nachos, cheeseburger, kids chicken and rice and a chicken bowl. Everything was good and the nachos were huge. Half price margaritas and I was also able to get 5%cash back using the yelp app. We weren't crazy about their style of rice, I think it was parboiled but it was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were good. Better than I thought they would be too. I was really hungry and thought 2 wouldn't fill me up but I was full after the first one. Good service with friendly employees. Could've been cleaner, but overall ok. Floors n ended to be swept. It was want a busy time at all so people in and out shouldn't have mattered. I've been sitting here an hour and no one attempt s to clean the floor. I also had to clean my own table off before I sat down. There was a girl walking around with a towel but she wasn't cleaning the tables!"}
{"text":"Tasty and fast. What more do you need between flights? Decent, although not expansive, seating."}
{"text":"So crowded, especially since people can only drink in the small space provided. The Phoenix airport (or the alcohol authorities) need to move into the 21st century and provide an area in the terminal for drinking, like Denver. Or just open up the whole terminal to drinking like Vegas. Anyone stuck in Phoenix needs a drink. 

The queso was pretty awful. Don't get it. The taco salad was pretty good, though. But the fact that I had to eat it standing up while crammed onto a little corner of a table was kind of ridiculous. While some weirdo lectured this poor college student about how she won't be so idealistic when she grows up. Sigh."}
{"text":"Eh...3...3.5.  My husband had been here a couple of times for happy hour with coworkers and mentioned that I should give it a try.  I liked it more than I thought I would, but a couple of things kept it from being more stars.  We were there on 6/27 for happy hour.

Our server, Cristianna, was nice and generally efficient at circling back around to check on us.  We each ordered a $3 HH margarita and got those pretty quickly.  I didn't have high expectations for a 3-dollar margarita, and it was just that...a cheap margarita.  I ordered another one I think for only 2 reasons:  it was hot out and they were 3 bucks, but I really didn't enjoy them and they gave me heartburn.  Meh.  

I ordered the 1 and only combo with the jalopy taco and that was a tasty dish.  It comes with a very small cheese enchilada, a delicious tamale, and you can choose a taco.  The jalopy taco is loaded down with ground beef, fried potatoes, lettuce, cheese, olives, etc. and I really enjoyed that as well.  Overall I think it's a little overpriced at $15.95.  It came with a side of clumpy rice and flavorless charro beans.  I ended up doctoring up the leftovers for breakfast the next day.  The tamale was really the best part of that dish.  

Mr. M had the sirnoran dog with onion strings and it was a really good hot dog but the bun was way too big.  That entree was $9.95.  Now that I pay attention to some of the other pictures, we'll definitely have to come back and try those batter-dipped fries.  The onion strings were really greasy and all clumped together.  Not all that appealing.

All in before tax and tip it was $43.13.  I don't regret it, but I do think it was a bit much.  

Another thing that dropped a star was the ladies' room was pretty nasty, and it was 5:30 in the afternoon.  I can't imagine how it is at 9:00 at night.  Yikes!  I would go back, but it's not high on my list."}
{"text":"As airport for goes really great. Small, wish they had a better seating capacity but the food was spot on and prepared fast."}
{"text":"Go to barrio queen instead. It's in the D gates. I love spicy food. When I get Mexican food I expect a reasonable amount of hot sauce. When I realized that my husband and I had only gotten 1 TINY container of hot sauce between our salad and burrito bowl I was concerned. I went back to ask for another and was informed even though I had ordered my salad without sour cream or cheese I had been given my allotted hot sauce and would have to go through the line again and pay for another tiny container of hot sauce.  Come on now, please. Service was deplorable. Stop at barrio queen in D gates and actually get good service and enjoy your food!"}
{"text":"BEST tacos. Grilled chicken is the way to go. We always go here for taco Tuesday. Tacos are half off and the service is great and the food always comes out so fast. I literally won't go to any other tacos spot. I just wish it wasn't at the chandler mall but that's the only down fall. Try this place out"}
{"text":"Very very little food given in the vegetable bowl. The container provided was less than half way full. I never write bad reviews but I think $10 for a snack is a bit much. Two stars given because service was quick and food was flavorful."}
{"text":"I stopped by for Tuesday tacos and was delighted. My server was friendly and helpful with the drink menu .  The salsa was wonderful.  Interesting selection of,tacos which made for some fun!"}
{"text":"2.0 Stars.

I understand price gouging at airports.
But $9.99 for a 6-8 inch burrito?
It was tasty, but it was no meal...merely a snack.

I felt robbed. I had a 1 1/2 hour lay over.
I should have walked around a little and asked if
there was a McDonald's in the airport.

SURE ENOUGH...THERE IS !!!

Don't spend your money here if you are really hungry."}
{"text":"Horrrible service. This IS an airport location so timelines is key. I just stood for ten minutes while the bartender was trying to teach Spanish to customers at bar. I was at an open seat and I didn't even get an acknowledgement that I was alive. Never ever will I go there again and I am here multiple times a week"}
{"text":"If you are in the Phoenix airport there are some good food options, my favorite are the sit down places, but if I don't have a lot of time, I will come here. I get the bowl, they put this sauce on it that is really good! It's a \"crema\" :). I've not tried their tacos or other dishes, but it's pretty decent for airport food. I would caution against ordering the chicken, it's not the best chicken, I would try the pork, beef, etc. 

I haven't tried the fish either, but they do have fish tacos.

Happy Airport Eating!"}
{"text":"Their website advertised happy hour everyday from 3pm-7pm. However, we were told that does not include sunday. Sunday does have a happy hour that starts at 4pm.

We came here at 3 specifically for happy hour & were disappointed.

However, even though the price was too high ($11 for a cheese crisp), the service & product were good."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here for lunch on a Saturday. It wasn't moderately busy. The servers kept walking past us without noticing us. It took a little bit for the server to come over to order our drinks. The alcohol was expensive. $10 for a margarita. We both got waters. Husband ordered the Sorrano Dog and it was very good. I ordered the Carné Asada burrito for $12.95. It only came with lettuce and a small amount of pico de gallo. Additional add ons were extra for the burrito. Burrito contained dry steak, black beans, cheese, and rice mixed with bean mixture. The filling was very dry and not very good to me. I had to eat some of my husband's fries. We also had the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were all broken up into small pieces, like the bottom of the bag chips. The salsa was good. I had to pour it over my burrito to make it taste better."}
{"text":"I love Sir Veza's! The staff are very friendly and attentive. When you order food, it always comes out quickly. The happy hour menu is awesome! The drink and food specials during happy hour are reasonably priced and happen everyday from 3-7. Margaritas are strong and flavorful. Tacos are huge and can easily be split among two people. A+++!"}
{"text":"Updating my review. I've been back here a number of times. The taco salad is still the best. Most of the time it is amazing. They have their off days sometimes but they always try to make it right if needed. 

Guac, tacos, taco salad, can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"We went here for convenience. Good for airport food. Tacos, burritos or bowls. Comes with a variety of ingredients and choice of protein. You pay up front at the register, then they prepare your food in a to-go box to eat in their small restaurant seating area or take with you to your gate. 

We got the beef bowl. Came with a good amount of rice, beans, meat, cheese, sour cream, salsa and even guacamole without extra charge. The portion size was good compared to the price of other restaurants at the airport. 

For what it was, airport food, it was decently priced, fast and tasted pretty good. Nothing to rant and rave about, but we were satisfied."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for the first time today before going Christmas shopping and the food is amazing. The staff is nice and attentive. Love this place and will definitely be back to try happy hour."}
{"text":"One of the staff members at the airport location has a really horrible attitude and approach with customers. We laughed at the ridiculousness of it and choose not to engage and opted for another line. She called me a f*cking stupid b*tch and then told me to move over so she could take another order when I could not move as I was waiting for the person in front of me to move and she was just trying to subvert power over me after I choose not engage. She was still angry and told a manager, that came over for her employees defense (and not an advocate for the business, customer, or even general ETHICAL values), minimized the whole thing and just asked us to move. Needless to say, we left and did not get to try the food for fear of retaliation. The lack of customer service and professionalism is definitely a huge problem. The serious anger/mental health issues of the employee should be a concern to everyone. We couldn't even get in the door and give them our money before their collection of horrible employees showed us we probably shouldn't. At the very least I appreciate that. When people show you who they are, believe them."}
{"text":"Delicious fish tacos, quickly prepared and served. Expensive, but that's pretty typical of airport food. Crowded seating area, but I still found a cozy place to eat. If I ever have another layover here I'd be happy to fine here again."}
{"text":"I've been here 3x thus far and each time has been a great experience. The food is always incredible, their Long Islands are perfection and the staff is always willing to assist you w/ anything. If you're leery of trying something really different, order a chicken quasadilla... BOMB.COM"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. The carne asada was too thick and maybe should be changed to steak on the menu. The steak was tough and without flavor. The salsa was blah and tasted like tomato sauce. The Las Vegas roll was good but needed a spice element because by itself it was bland as well."}
{"text":"Cool happy hour vibe. Gets really busy so come early or have patience with good friends or family.
Taco tour is a can't miss. Get the carne asada or pollo.
Wash it down with a decent selection of cervezas on tap."}
{"text":"My salad was very tasty. My husbands tacos were good but had very few veggies on it, mostly meat, which isn't what we prefer in a taco. Service was so-so. 
The biggest complaint was the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other at all. And one of the waitress smelled heavily of alcohol. I MIGHT come back but my husband definitely would not."}
{"text":"Girlsfriends and I took a weekend trip to Phoenix, and came across this awesome place! The food was fresh and amazing. The customer service was above and beyond. Our waitress Layne, was one of the most honest and down to earth servers I've ever had. I would definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service on a very busy morning at the Phoenix airport! There are a lot of tasty options. I had the black bean breakfast bowl. It was hard to choose because I wanted a few different items. The bowl was pretty great-especially for fast airport food. I also loved the coffee! 

There isn't a lot of seating so you may have to stand or take it to go if it's a busy airport day!"}
{"text":"Worst, slowest service ever. I had limited time to get food before a 2.5 hour flight home, and I ordered a simple quesadilla, waited 15 mins and ended up refunding it to catch my flight. Angry, hungry, annoyed. 6 people working, only 3 cooking with the other 3 standing around...get it together, people, speed matters at airports."}
{"text":"In the spirt of taco Tuesday , I came here and it was a great discussion ! Half of tacos , they were great , ceviche wasn't awesome :( 
Oh well , it's still a cool place"}
{"text":"We bought a Living Social for this place and were excited to try it out. The atmosphere is funky and fun. 

We ordered the T-bucket Sampler (fries, onion rings, carnitas quesadilla, mini chimis, chicken fingers)  and the 2 tacos (carnitas and centerfold). The food was delicious and their prickly pear bbq sauce is delish! The bucket was HUGE and had plenty of food for the two of us. We had enough leftovers just from the bucket for another complete meal.

The waiter was extremely friendly and attentive. Service was quick. Our waiter even offered us a to-go drink for the road which I LOVE!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"First off I love this place the food is amazing but the only reason we keeps coming back is because of Marcus! He gives the best service always gives us the best recommendation on food! If you ever stop into this place he's your sever to go too!"}
{"text":"Chips n salsa, good drank, good thangs!!!! Staff is super friendly and the environment is on point."}
{"text":"Cool casual place.  Great music. Decor is very well done. Prompt with the chips and salsa which were delicious. Excellent beer selection. We had the pork carnitas tacos and the grilled chicken tacos. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"just ok food and terrible service....you smile and say hello and thank you and the tattooed ghetto girls here smirk at you......ALL OF THEM.....fourth time here....they are at least consistent at not training their staff...... trying something else next time..."}
{"text":"Tacos are good  atmosphere not so great  loud alternative rock music screaming too loud, should find something to play that all ages might enjoy! So loud, had a hard time talking with my date!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Got the taco salad. Was at first disappointed because I only saw lettuce, but once I dug in, got to the crunchy taco shell, nicely grilled chicken pieces (lots of it) and delicious beans and other ingredients. Not a lot of seats though so it was a bit difficult to get comfortable but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick lunch before a flight and was pleasantly surprised. The quality beats Chipotle. The bowl was fantastic, really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Actually good, but really quite expensive. Would love a more Chipotle style menu where you pick a base and select what you want. I came here while on Whole30 and basically got a slab of meat with salsa for $13. Not the best deal and would have loved some lettuce or vegetables or something like that. Other than that, a fair place for some decent food at the airport. 

The main detraction from this place is the seating. It's really awkward and hard to walk around so don't sit here if you have a lot of luggage - you'll probably have to stand."}
{"text":"Here for a flight to SLC....
courteous and quick staff ....yummy breakfast bacon-egg- potato burrito and perfect mimosa to let me nap a bit on the flight!"}
{"text":"Personally I wouldn't recommend out the food was not what I was expecting. Service was alright bit the best."}
{"text":"This is based on my visit to the walk up counter in the mall to the sit down restaurant.  I got a Sonora dog and it was great.  I also liked that I was give chips and salsa just like I was in the sit down restaurant.
Maybe next time I will go inside and see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Really good! Was surprised, with all the big names in the airport like zinc, chelsea's, chevraunt, I wanted something quick. It was quick but wow it was really good! Carnitas & chicken tacos with corn tortillas had great flavor. Even the beans & rice (beans on top of rice) were seasoned perfectly. Kiltlifter on tap I like this place. If I get a chance to come again they may make it to 5 star."}
{"text":"Wow.  Airport food that is delicious. Chicken tacos are my favorite as the hot salsa they provide is made with quality ingredients.  

Definitely will visit the Chandler location soon."}
{"text":"Delicious food; fast, friendly service. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try our Sir Veza's while taking a break from Christmas shopping. We heard about it about 2 months ago when we were in Tucson on a weekend get away. While there we ate at place called El Charro and the owner told us he was opening a new restaurant near us.

The restaurant was auto garage themed but I think the restaurant  is suffering from an identity crisis because the building mentioned nothing about being a taco garage, only yelp totally us that.

Service was good, but they served Pepsi products (not a Pepsi fan). Second the food was so so. The chips and salsa were great, but our appetizer was a big bucket of oily fried foods. Enough so, that had we finished all of it, we probably wouldn't have felt great. The portions on items that went by our table were huge, maybe too big. All and all, I've say it was average, not horrible, not great, just average."}
{"text":"Thought I'd grab a bite while waiting for my flight. The good:  counter service was great. The slider buns were fresh.
The mediocre:  burger patty didn't look like or taste like beef.  It was mashed down on the flat top it was dry and devoid of any meat juice. The Monterrey jack cheese was no where to be found and the thousand island dressing couldn't help over come the overcooked, dry patty. The fries we cooked in a fryer used to cook seafood. 

The bakery next door would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"You can always judge a place by the quality of the salsa when it hits the table. Meh. That's the story behind this place: meh. Severely over-priced for what you get and the wait staff is clearly just counting down the minutes until their shift ends and they are freed. I'd get more customer service from a robot. Margarita was terrible, but my Corona was solid . Take your $12-13/per person and go to Barrio or Joyride if you're interested in great tacos."}
{"text":"Our flight from Washington to Burbank had a layover at Phoenix.  I remembered going to Sir Veza's a little over a year ago and I really like their Chorizo burrito.  It was completely crowded so it took a while to get our food.  This time my daughter and I ordered the following:

Cheese quesadilla ($9): hardly any cheese but my daughter still said she liked it. 

Combo Taco place ($12): I got the carnitas and birria taco and they were pretty good.  Lots of tender meat so it was good.  

At least I know a decent and expensive place to eat at when I'm at the Phoenix Airport."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. The flat enchiladas are so good. I was also happy that they had a huge selection of draft beer. We sat at the bar and loved that they use shop rags as napkins. really unique. The chips and salsa were addictive. I will be back."}
{"text":"No. No. No. Do not waste your time or money on this place. Terrible service for an empty establishment and even worse drinks. I ordered Patron and got bar tequila. Like I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  Go next door to Kona grill."}
{"text":"This trip to Sky Harbor Airport Term 4 included a visit to Sir Veza's.

Food
Average - not bad, not memorable.

Atmosphere
Cool, rustic antique-looking stuff  surrounds the dining area.

I wouldn't walk across the concourse to eat here, but it wasn't terrible.

Good thing they have a captive flow of hungry diners waiting for flights to airports near and far"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor the next time you're in Sky Harbor and get the veggie tacos. I prefer the flour tortillas. 

People have to be ordering the wrong thing here! Why only a 3 star rating?? I've eaten meat for 28 years and the vegetarian tacos have got to be some of the best tacos I have ever had, meat or vegetarian. 

Personally, the small side of rice and beans isn't anything to get excited about, but the tacos are killer. I travel a lot for work and every time I stop in phoenix, I make a trip over to sir vezas near C12 no matter where I get into or fly out of. 

I have a friend in Tucson who was like \"meh\" when I suggested sir vezas. Once he had the tacos, he was pleasantly surprised and a convert.  You will be too."}
{"text":"Ask for Matthew! ON POINT!! Awesome service, food and brews. Best service I've had in years, definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Was connecting in PHX and tried this place out because there was nothing else there. Got a chicken bowl and was pretty disappointed. Chicken had tons of fat on it and was very bland on it. Rest of the bowl was okay but still not something I would try again."}
{"text":"My visit was for the Mayweather fight. The cover was absurd $30 per person. But considering the place wasn't very crowded we went for it. They sat us at a small table with no view of the very few TV's in the restaurant. We took it upon ourselves to sit in a better view area. And then were told that the table was reserved, but would only be relocated once they showed up. They never showed. As for the service, it was super slow. It seemed like we were the last table to get service and if we needed anything we waited forever for staff to come back around. We even went up to the bar to order our own drinks. What made it even worse is there was a group of fruit flies flying around a few tables that made it disgusting to eat or be around. I ordered a micheladas, worst one I have ever tasted. They use like the premixed lime juice, which tasted like margarita mix, no clamato. I reordered for a mojito and the same mix was used! Drinks are horrible!!! Order a beer to be safe. I would not go back nor recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great bar and restaurant! 

Loved this place in Tucson and it is a good set up for Chandler fashion.

I recommend the happy hour specials and watching UofA here!"}
{"text":"Certainly in the top ten for airport food.  The food portions are generous, and while you're overpaying because it's an airport, it's not too ridiculous.  Service has always been fast and friendly for both food and drinks.  They have a pretty good selection of craft beers too."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were pretty tasty but came with no sauce.  Asked for green salsa and got red.  Also, it was $24 for 4 tacos"}
{"text":"Great food, we had the tacos. They were delicious and good sized. Not little dinky street tacos. The music is just very loud so it's hard to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for airport food.  Quick and not bad.  Ordered combination tacos (you can mix and match) before a flight, they packed it really well - each taco was individually wrapped in a foam box and then a bag.  No messes here.

I ordered one chicken taco and one carnitas taco both in flour.  Chicken was tasty, good flavors, not dry.  The carnitas taco was greasy and not as flavorful - would not recommend.  They charged me an extra 50 cents for the combo.  Guacamole is an extra 75 cents.  Salsa verde comes with your order, but it's pre packaged and not fresh.  

I didn't have time (and the real reason I had a morning flight) - or else it looked like a great place to drink prior to take off!"}
{"text":"Great ambience and service.  Mediocre mexican food.  Not terrible, just not memorable.  If you want to drink and have fun with friends this is a good bet. If you are looking for good food, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just say no. This place looked like a fun place to eat. Boy was I wrong. After checking out the menu we asked the server what she recommended since none of us had eaten there before. She recommended the enchiladas and nachos. My husband and dad ordered the enchiladas and I ordered the nachos. The enchiladas came in a scalding hot iron pan and appeared to be a soup since the small
Enchiladas were drowning in a sea of red sauce. You seriously couldn't even see them. No one mentioned the skillet they came in was very hot when the food was delivered and my father burned his fingers to the blistering point by touching it to move his platter around. My nachos were ordered with the carnitas which was cold and unappetizing. And I had a bout of food poisoning the next morning. 

As a newcomer to the Chandler area I was looking forward to a fun and delicious meal at Sir Vezas. Let me just say, this was my first and last visit there."}
{"text":"Wanted to pick up a quick bite before my flight and well...it definitely wasn't quick or worth it. I ordered a vegetarian bowl which was basically just beans rice, guacamole, sour cream and salsa. Came out to about $8.50. It was easy to place my order but I had to wait 13 minutes to receive it. The space is very small and crowded and there isn't really any place to stand and wait for your to go order. Talking to another customer, she seemed very frustrated at the wait time as well. I didn't notice until I got onto the plane that my rice was over cooked and hard which was disappointing but I was starving.

I was not a fan of my experience and the food was mediocre but it was convenient. 

They do have a bar with tv's which a lot of people seemed to be utilizing because the football game was on. The staff was also friendly."}
{"text":"Meh...Hungry at the Phoenix airport and they were playing the NBA finals...Why does \"meh\" airport food have to be sooo pricey?"}
{"text":"Staff unpleasant and dismissive.  Food awful.  I travel through Phoenix often, will never again pay for the overpriced \"food\" again."}
{"text":"My BF and I come here a lot as they have vegan food and are happy to accommodate my picky needs. Chuck and Fire behind the bar are always friendly and pour a tasty drink!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and décor are really nice and make for a fun place to eat.

I got the tacos; I never order tacos from anywhere. Felt like they were missing something, like a little spice, but were overall good. Also the brownie with ice cream was bomb!

Our server was very nice and quick to serve out table of 5, + 2 kids. Even better is the fact that they have groupons, which we used.

I will most likely be back and plan to try something different."}
{"text":"Located near C11, you can eat at Sir Veza's at the few seats they have available or take it to go. They have breakfast burritos, meaty burritos and a vegetarian veggie burrito that can be made vegan if you ask them to leave the cheese off. You can also have rice bowls, chips, guac, queso, etc. 

I have had the vegan veggie burrito twice now and it was consistently delicious. It has a lot of black beans so if you are sensitive to the effects of beans, just ask them to leave it off. Also in that burrito is rice, peppers, onions, corn and guac. Their salsas are prepackaged and both red and green are so delicious. They are considerably quick for food made to order so you can grab food in between flights.

The guacamole was delicious but I was not impressed with the chips. They did not have any seasoning or salt on them so they lacked flavor. I would definitely order the burrito again or a burrito bowl."}
{"text":"Want to know how to gross a vegetarian out? Stick a big chunk of chicken in their vegan burrito bowl. Never again!"}
{"text":"Chuck the bartender is amazing! Love his bartender ears and handmade sangria ;) and D the waitress is on point, not even our server and made sure we had anything we needed the entire time! 5 stars"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since Kona was packed. There happy hour food was pretty much all fried food nothing healthy. Nor was any of it to write home about . the so called spicy was sweet. There was 6 of us we all ordered dinner and not one of us was impressed what so ever.then or dirty plates sat in front of us for over a half a hour tell I see our girl and I asked her to please take them away.  So not impressed with this place. Don't think we will be back:((( we will stick with Kona grill"}
{"text":"I came in for the first time a few days ago and had an amazing experience! I have pretty high standards for mexican food but the nitro nachos topped all my expectations. Our server, Denise was such a delight and made us some awesome table side guac! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Single. Use. Plastics. Unless you're at a keg party, this is not a good way to serve beer. The food is adequate."}
{"text":"Flight delayed and was super hungry, so I decided to eat here. Airport restaurant, didnt expect much. Cashier recommended carnitas tacos and I am so glad I got it. Is it overpriced at 12 dollars? Definitely. Was it delicious though? Yep! Being from California, I have had my fair share of Mexican food, and I would say the tacos I got definitely held it's own in terms of quality (but perhaps divide cost by 2)"}
{"text":"Dee was an amazing hostess. Joe was a really good guy totally gave me the menu, let me know exactly what it is that they were serving. They were super cool especially letting me know that they're happy hour is from 3 PM to 7 PM, and from 9 PM to closing time. Thank you guys very much for being super cool I'm from totally hooking me up. I really appreciate businesses that go the extra mile. I love the bar atmosphere, and I totally love the food. Once again thank you guys."}
{"text":"the tortilla was undercooked, the potatoes were overcooked, the cheese was almost non-existent. the eggs tasted like they were from powder. and the whole thing cost about $4 more than such a small burrito should, even at the airport."}
{"text":"The vegetarian tamales here were excellent. I am a picky tamale critic, having grown up in CA, but this spot fit the bill. The breakfast bowl was pretty tasty, though I guess I was expecting it to be over rice. The tortilla chips were an odd find, but hey, I guess a starch is a starch...sort of. I would've preferred eggs and sour cream etc over rice, but it was still good. Had my flight been delayed any longer I would've gone back for more items from the lunch menu. Service here was fast, even during busy rushes. I'll definitely come back here on my next layover on Southwest. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Pricey but good. The sonoran hot dog was delicious. Taco salad also a good choice."}
{"text":"It's like a knock off chipotle but the food is disgusting. I got the chicken bowl. The rice was hard and the beans were cold . The chicken was flavorless . The beer was cold even tho it was served in a red solo cup. The staff was really nice tho which is why they got a star. Worst airport food I've ever had, and i travel a lot!"}
{"text":"Debra Is the best. Great food and very kind, efficient service on a busy Thanksgiving weekend."}
{"text":"I had the chicken burrito. It was really dry and missing the Queso that it's advertised with. It's the only time I've eaten here, so maybe something else will be better. Just not that. The service was quick and price was moderate for an airport."}
{"text":"I dont expect much from airport food but REALLY?   Slider was terrible, 14 french fries  to go along with this Dry meal!    Nachos were bland at best.   Rather have hit up McDonald's!!!"}
{"text":"Had a mimosa & Bloody Mary along with a breakfast burrito.  Service from the bar was great.  Burrito was ok, not bad.  Mimosa was good, Bloody Mary was not bad.  I didn't like the salt/spice rim that they used. Overall I'd come here again and sit at the bar"}
{"text":"Not the best food in the world but when your flight has been delayed and you're just about starving it does the job. Decent prices and pretty kick ass service. Geo and the team made my crappy day so much better."}
{"text":"When I get charged 50 cents for a side of barbecue sauce...I'm not coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best laid back bars to come in and enjoy your time with friends , the food was amazing (Diablo, pork) and the gluten free chips and salsa were just as amazing as the two margaritas , Our server Joe despite the 5 or 6 tables it looked like he had insured our drinks were filled and table was cleared of any dirty dishes along with the others . Couldn't help but leave $20 def the highest tip I've ever left for just my friend and myself. The manager and other employees were just as awesome coming by and checking on everyone ! Please stay !!"}
{"text":"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL
Been here a few times over the last couple of years.... this by far was the worst and the last time.  No greeter at the door incorporated with slow and lethargic employees who clearly have no sense of urgency whatsoever makes a very bad impression.  Had to ask for items twice before getting them.  Basics like asking if sweetener was needed when serving ice tea, completely non existent. All of this while the restaurant is slow is unacceptable to say the least. Patio furniture ripped and falling apart at the seams clearly says that the owners/operators don't care about this place.  Looks like this restaurant space will be available soon.  Good luck Sir.  If you want to stay in business at this location, you'll need it."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a bite to eat since I had plenty of time before my flight. I ordered shredded beef tacos, queso and chips, and rice. The rice I could have passed on, it was flavorless and dry but as far as the rest of my meal it was fantastic. The tacos had good spice and were so juicy. Sir Veza's was little too crowded though, I had no place so sit and wait for my food. A little frustrating but I guess a good crowd means good food."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Friendly cashier but the food comes out very slowly (20 minutes for a takeout order).

The carnitas bowl was not great (granted that I got it without onions and peppers and sour cream). The rice was undercooked (hard), the carnitas were neither crispy nor stewed well and too salty, and the salsa was packaged. It was at least half beans.

At least it was filling."}
{"text":"Great airport spot. They serve you drinks in red Solo cups LOL. Wish it wasn't so packed, but I guess that's what happens when you have the best food and drank in the terminal #hype
PS I'm the duchess"}
{"text":"Not worth it for the price. I ordered guacamole and chips for $8.25, and it was 1/4 cup of guacamole with about 40+ chips that went to the trash can. It wasn't a great appetizer, either. I was craving guacamole so I risked paying almost $10, and it was a mistake. Maybe their other items are worth the cost for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a beer while I waited for my flight. The staff is super friendly and are always there when you need something. As far as the food, its your typical taco shop in arizona, nothing amazing, but good (been to other locations). The thing that drops my review down is the unprofessionalism of the manager. I don't car what is happening you dont discipline your employees in front of customers. Yelling load enough for the whole place to hear for them to \"find something to do\", and saying \"he knows he is mean so sorry\". Dude you need to take a leadership or managment course. Other than that its a decent place to go."}
{"text":"This is a very poor representation of what an Arizona burrito should taste like. Places like this are the reason the people of California think their burritos are better. When in fact they are absolutely not better than a real Arizona burrito. I would rather have Taco Bell than eat a burrito here. But they have free refills on soft drinks. So I guess that's a plus."}
{"text":"This place is great. Beer is served only in red Solo cups just like a proper dive bar. Build your own burritos, fish tacos. All good. Hey you're in an airport, set expectations accordingly! Love this place"}
{"text":"Omg please get the Diablo shrimp tacos. They are life changing. Hahaha. 

Honestly though the food is awesome, and the waitstaff are all knowledgable, with a great list of recommendations from the menu. The tacos are AMAZING. I was hungry so I ordered three and should've only gotten two. They are amazing flavors and expertly made. :)

Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"I came to eat here when visiting my brother in Arizona. He swore this place had the best micheladas in Arizona so I for sure needed to try. It was a Friday afternoon around 4pm-5pm so it wasn't too packed yet. It was happy hour so they had 1/2 off appetizers and some discounted drinks which was good. We ordered a round of micheladas and let me tell you, my brother wasn't lying. They were good! When it came to the food, I ordered a appetizer. It was the Jalapeno Poppers (they had a different name and cant remember what it is). They were ok. Very crunchy which im not use to with jalapeno poppers and the cream cheese inside was very runny. I wouldn't get them again. For my meal I ordered the shrimp tacos (grilled shrimp not the Diablo shrimp) and it came with rice and beans. The rice and beans were not good. I'm Mexican so I guess you can say I have a high standard of what they should taste like and this wasn't it. Very generic almost tasted like they were canned. The rice was also not well cooked, kinda dry and crunchy. The shrimp tacos were good. The seasoning was good and the salsa it had was also very good. I would get them again but minus the rice and beans. All in all a great place for drinks but if you want Mexican food, definitely not the place for it."}
{"text":"I actually think the food is four stars based on the airport scale of jeebusi'vebeenpoisonedtellmyfamilyilovethem to prettygoodactuallyididntjustgoovermycaloriesfortheweekinoneday.   Just clean your tables and give us more seats. It's crowded like a frat party on a Friday night. Forfuxsake."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection! Tons of rotating seasonals. The whole staff was great, especially our server, Denise. Ideal atmosphere to watch the fights."}
{"text":"for a Hispanic themed restaurant it didn't really taste Hispanic. The chicken burrito was ok, reason being is the beans were too dry and the chicken was flavorless yet the rice was surprisingly good. The pre packages salsa was not spicy whatsoever and was ok."}
{"text":"The two stars is for ambiance and location only.  Awesome location with outdoor patio area draws you in.  BUT.. service is non-existent. Servers always try to look busy doing something else.  After 15 minutes waiting for water,  went to the bar to get it myself.  Food sounded good on the menu and looks appealing inn other tables but totally flavorless and bland (No Bueno for Mexican food).  What a shame, cool name, hip location and cool setup. Now you just need to get the employees to give a shit about taking advantage of what they have."}
{"text":"So loud and and uncomfortable. Extremely pricey and they give very little food. Def one of my worse airports breakfasts. Don't come here"}
{"text":"What do you say? Over priced airport food. The chicken burrito was dry. It only came with chicken rice and beans. No sauces. 

We also ordered the 3 cheese quesadilla and that was pretty good but still it was $8. Over priced airport food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for an airport eating spot. Cool vibe, friendly employees, but mostly good and reasonably-priced food. Don't they know they have us where they want us and are supposed to rip us off with high prices for marginal food? I guess these guys didn't get the memo and I'm glad. I always get the chicken bowl, but many things look really good. A big selection of craft beers on tap and flat screens seal the deal. Now I look forward to landing in Phoenix and long layovers don't even scare me anymore. Like most places in any airport the elbow room is a little close and cozy, but that just goes with the territory. Fly in when you get a chance!"}
{"text":"Great chicken bacon quesadillas.  Tortillas are insanely good.   Staff is friendly and good atmosphere for a airport"}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast bowl with Applewood bacon and queso. I asked for no salsa, which they accommodated me on that. However, their chilaquilas (an ingredient in my bowl) is really enchilada sauce. In what world are those two the same thing? Chilaquilas is eggs, nacho chip strips, ranchero sauce and cheese. Since they soaked all of the chips in this enchilada sauce, the whole thin tasted horrible. The bacon was in whole slices rather than broken up - doesn't make sense for eating a bowl. They used green olives which I've NEVER had on Mexican food. I hate green olives and would have asked which kind they were had I thought they might something other than the traditional black olives. My husband did not like his breakfast tacos either. The only reason they are getting two stars is we've had good quesadillas here before."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have always thought the service was mediocre to nonexistent. The icing on top was recently when I came here for dinner. We were seated. My boyfriend had time to use the bathroom and then return. I had time to book a reservation for an event. After doing all this, I realized about 10+ minutes elapsed and no one had come to say hi. So I started looking around and try to give off that body language that we were ready to order. Still, no one came. So, my boyfriend and I left. Once we stood up, someone finally realized we were leaving and offered to get someone immediately but by this time, we had already decided to go. 

As for the food, it's mediocre. They do have sizable margaritas. 

Layout of restaurant is kind of strange but there is a lot of open space that leads to patio, which is nice for a cooler spring/fall/winter day. 

Overall, horrible service and unimpressive."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Probably the best shrimp taco my travel partner has ever had, and I ordered the vegetarian taco which was great!! Super fast, would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Our second time and this food and unique margaritas are really awesome... The tacos are also very good and several unique taco varieties... The service has been great very informative servers that seemed passionate about the menu.... I'm Surprised this place is not packed more often... It's better food than Kona Grill next door.  Killer salsa"}
{"text":"*** So sad. They changed the menu and now the Nivana taco is made with Brussel sprouts and fajita mix which I can not eat .  I can't even express how sad this makes me 


I didn't think it was possible but they got even better with updates menu I'm loving the Nirvana vegetarian tacos. Wonderful!  I've had them two days in a row   David provided awesome service!  He's our regular guy . 

Excellent food and service !  All seasonings are gluten free.  Burro bowl not just filled with rice like some places. I had the shredded chicken.  I tasted shredded beef and really good not fatty.

They have $8 lunch and 1/2 off taco Tuesday 

Dog friendly patio

Large outside space. I bet it's really busy at night as they have happy hour and really fun atmosphere 

I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I loved it here!! The decor was fun, the beers were cold, the food was great, and the service was exceptional.  Make sure you try the prickly pear wings!"}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff, heard them talking behind the counter about other customers; ordered a burrito bowl and was given an actual burrito, staff looked at me like I was crazy when I brought it back and said my order was wrong, then proceeded to talk to each other about it when I was standing right there. Too bad the customer service is awful because the food is actually not too bad."}
{"text":"can airport food be both expensive AND crappy? sir veza's strives to answer that question, and answer it they do. while at first glance the menu appears promising, assuming you can get past the idea that you're paying 5 dollars for a single beef taco, the delivery unfortunately falls short. 

the chips were stale, the tomatoes had that mealy texture of refrigeration, and the chicken was clearly frozen shortly prior to my consumption of it.  while a good guacamole can cover a multitude of sins, this guac did not cover for anyone. it was tasteless.

in short, this is a passable meal for a disappointing (but not surprising) price. i was not expecting greatness, but i was hoping for it. i'll keep hoping somewhere else, i suppose."}
{"text":"Very, very good. As soon as I saw this popping up in the mall I was interested. I just visited for the first time and was a worthwhile experience. They have a variety of nice beers available, and the happy hour(s) are generous. I do particularly like the open air bar setup they've got going on, especially since they've  kept it very clean. Fast and friendly service. Definitely get the SirVeza fries. They are incredible."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place. We were told to seat ourselves and someone would come by.... 20 minutes later, I got a walking by waitress and asked her if she could get someone to bring us menus. She was super apologetic. The food was less than decent. I had chicken tacos which was good and a carne asada taco which was NOT, bland no flavor. Service was slow, place was not too busy. Not impressed. Not worth my money, even with the discount I got from Living Social."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite prior to my flight. Made my bowl vegan which basically came down to 5 ingredients and boy did they skimp. For the price, and I get it.... The airport is always overpriced, but then you add in the reduction of food choices that comes with the meal and it was like I got half the serving for a full price. Needless to say it was not worth the price at all. The speed however was super quick and seeing the amount of people they were serving food to at once that was pretty impressive. 

Well, you live and you learn next time I just have to pack my lunch when flying, just sucks when you're delayed. Maybe they can figure out some kind of balance to make the cost with it."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for Happy Hour and we were not impressed.  Service was spotty, house margs were weak, we had to ask for chips and salsa and when we finished the small amount brought to us, we were never asked if we wanted more.  I tried the tamale pie corn fritters.  They were uncooked in the middle and lacked flavor.  We also got the papas locas which are cheese fries.  The description says cheddar, but it was actually a cheese sauce and the fries were drenched in it.  The fries were mushy, and not just because of the enormous amount cheese sauce.  The BF got the chicken sliders which he said were \"ok\".  Nothing about this place makes me look forward to going back...so we probably won't."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 0 star option. Went in last night for a few drinks. We were seated right away but no one came to take our order, or even notice that we were sitting there for about 25 minutes. All the waiters just kept walking by. It wasn't even busy. So we walked out and no one seemed to care. I will never step foot in that place again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and fun, service wasn't great and the food was so, so. Not sure if it was an off night, but we had water spilled on us, nasty dirty silverware, and a gentleman threw up in the floor right by our table...hoping for a better second experience someday because it has potential to be super fun."}
{"text":"Always stop by here for my Bloody Mary's before heading out to wherever I have to go. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"So so bad. Do not waste your time or money. Chips and queso... seems simple right? Nope. Chips were soft and moist, and the queso was some crap out of a jar that was just lightly melted over a few chips. Also ordered some drinks from the bar.  Margarita came without salt asked of i could get salt and the bartender responds with, did you ask for salt? Omg, really are you serious? The answer is yes, but even if i didn't why would you even ask me that? Then my beer had 2 inches of foam in leaving my 16 oz beer with about 11oz drinkable.  I don't normally rant on yelp, but I truly don't want anyone else to make the same mistake that we did this evening.  Make the walk to gate A11 and eat at taco Blanco's 4 stars Mexican at terminal 4."}
{"text":"One doesn't expect too much from an airport eatery, but Sir Veza's Taco Garage is pretty darn good.  If you don't mind your tamales a little greasy, then you should give the corn and green chiles tamales a try.  Need something even simpler than that?  I enjoyed the beans and rice.  They're seasoned just right.

In short: if you're hungry in Terminal 4, pick this place."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food, but I can say that the margaritas they have for Happy Hour are dang good!  They're only like $3 on happy hour which is basically a steal.  We were served complimentary chips and salsa even though we weren't ordering food which was really nice.  The bartender was very attentive and had a great repoir with all the patrons."}
{"text":"I sat there for 10 min and nothing from the staff. All 5 behind the counter. I finally asked for a menu and what type of non alcoholic beer they had. the manager pull away from his phone and bragging to other customers about how much he works and points to the wall for the menu. Goes back to his phone and tells me no non alcoholic \"anything\". That was it for helping me. Another 20 min of waiting with no help I went next door to paradise bakery. Having to eat at an airport bar is bad enough without shit service and attitude."}
{"text":"$10 for a sad tiny bowl with extremely dry grilled chicken. Way overpriced and so not worth it. ):"}
{"text":"Grabbed the sliders, on the way to CO and they were great!  Such a pleasant surprise!  They were well priced at $10 for two, with fries.  The burgers were substantial, for sliders, well cooked and seasoned.   The fries were shoe strings and perfectly crunchy and salty.  Will stop by again when traveling next time!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. The car theme is pretty cool and it's tastefully decorated with a nice layout. Decent menu selection of Mexican food and a full bar. Food was better than I expected and was served quickly. We had an awesome waitress so our service was great. Prices were reasonable for the quality. Entire place was clean, including the restrooms. Will come here again if in the area. (I didn't get the \"Sir Veza's\"= cerveza, as in the Spanish word for beer, until after I left. hahaha)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is difficult to get seating and very crowded. 

The fish tacos were one of the best I've tasted. It's hard to find good tasting food in airports. The prices are fair given that everything in the airport is pricier. 

We got the chicken bacon quesadilla, the chicken bowl, and the hot dog.  The hot dog was exceptional but the other two items were average. 

I would highly recommend their fish tacos!"}
{"text":"I had a flight to SF that was departing from a gate near this place and wanted to grab a bite before I boarded.  It looked like a cool place and offered some menu items that looked good.  After browsing the menu, I ordered:

Nitro Nachos, $8.95

Quesadilla, $6.95 + Peppers, $2
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sir-vezas-taco-garage-phoenix?select=Lualv9KuNGft6MChnGZwpg#Lualv9KuNGft6MChnGZwpg

1L Water, $3

The Nachos were pretty good, but messy.  I had to eat 1/2 of the dish with a fork because the bottom half was soaked in Queso Cheese.  I don't recommend ordering this to take on a plane....it's not plane friendly as you will get messy.

The Quesadilla was very interesting.  I ordered it with the Peppers, which was an additional $2....it actually came with Peppers & Onions.  It tasted like an Italian Pepper & Onions Sandwich.....which was good, but unexpected.

Overall, I thought the food was pretty good for airport food.

{"text":"Visiting Arizona with some friends and came here for taco Tuesday. Our waiter Corbin was awesome and we got a good seat for watching some basketball. He gave us some good recommendations for tacos! Corbin also was considerate and telling us when our orders are coming out a little bit late."}
{"text":"Stumbled across a Living Social deal and couldn't wait to try this new Mexican restaurant. 

Ordered the Stuffed Chipotle Chicken (chipotle cream, corn tamale stuffed, poblano) with a side of calabacitas and black beans. SO delicious!!! 

I came here during the lunch hour and our waitress Christin was friendly and knowledgable. Also, the food came out very quick and perfect for a lunch rush. 

Didn't get an opportunity to try any of the cocktails, but they seem to have a great Happy Hour menu with cheap drinks and eats. We'll be sure to come here for Happy Hour soon. 

They have only been open for 4 months and are having their Grand Opening at the end of March. Get in before it gets too busy, because this place is going to be rockin' in no time. 


Gracias Sir Veza!!!!"}
{"text":"Sit at the bar to get good service. The corn dip was not good, bland and jus a can of sweet corn thrown in really. I was quickly given the edamame and that was good. It could've used more heat so I got sliced jalapeños. Overall, jus what u would imagine a mall rest/bar to be. Not a destination but a fun stop off.  Wanted to give an extra star for the bar staff but the food......"}
{"text":"I really do like this place, this is my third time coming here and it's always been good. This third time I have came however was a bit different the staff seem confused and a little slow with the drinks and food, mind you this is the day after thanksgiving. Overall still a good place to check out good food good times the indoor decor is also really cool give you a an old rustic garage feel. This place gets the Carlos one thumb up."}
{"text":"I love this place! And the bartender Kendall is the bestest ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here in the past, for lunch and they UFC events. Their food is pretty good however they servers seem to not be consistent. Being her over 20 mins , finding bugs in two of my drinks and no round chips and salsa. I wish that she had offered me a free drink or something for the wait and inconvenience.  The enjoy the mood here. Great TVs for sports and spaced out with out tables to close by."}
{"text":"Matt R is AMAZING!!! So friendly!!! So attentive!! Has great recommendations on the menu! The food is ALWAYS good here!"}
{"text":"I needed lunch during a layover. Unfortunately, PHX doesn't have many options. So I settled on this place. The decor was fun and the menu LOOKED good. But it is best not to judge a book by its cover. 

First, we ordered the sliders. I was starving but my wife just wanted a snack. Figuring the sliders might be enough to satisfy us both, we ordered them. You get TWO sliders for $8. They were flavorless, but not terrible.

Because that didn't satisfy my hunger, I went back and ordered the nachos. Nachos, how hard could that be? Ok, these were TERRIBLE! The cheese, wasn't cheese. And it didn't even come close to tasting like cheese. The meat certainly didn't look like meat. And the chips weren't very good either. I've never done this before, but I actually returned them. I wasn't about to pay $12 for the 2 terrible bites my wife and I took. 

Find another place, you won't be happy eating here."}
{"text":"Huge portions and tasty stuff. Trust the bartender, she knows what to recommend."}
{"text":"Better than average airport food. I had breakfast tacos. I wish they had cooked the bacon more but I enjoyed the mix of flavors. 

They serve a good beer selection in red solo cups. Also have PHX local beer Kilt Lifter"}
{"text":"Sirnoran Dog $8.95
Applewood bacon, 100% angus beef hot dog and old school fries.

Fries - crinkle cut and seasoned with salt & pepper 

Dog - mayo mustard beans tomatoes , very delicious.  I also added green chile sauce and cut up that grilled pepper that was on the side.  Wow that was spicy, my lips are burning.  

Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Chicken burrito.  Chicken boiled more than grilled.  Strange mini rice, but had black beans.  Corona light on tap!"}
{"text":"We visited Sir Veza's for the first time and were attracted to it by the fun music and atmosphere! The food was amazing and our waiter Matthew was so kind and helpful. He recommended he Diablo shrimp tacos and they were amazing. Prices were reasonable too. Highly recommend this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"This place sucks, shredded beef looks like it was soaking in water, it was bland, had to eat it with jalapeños just to get some taste, the tacos were weird looking and the nacho cheese was yucky not like the cheese in good Old San Antone. Will not return Hasta la Vista Baby"}
{"text":"I waited for about 5 min at the bar which didn't even have a bartender behind it. When the bartender arrived, she pleasantly took my drink order, but then helped two ppl after me (poured a soda for a kid at the bar and then closed out a check). It's not like airport bars are amazing, but this level of service was pretty poor. Oh well, beer in hand now : )"}
{"text":"The worst tacos they should be called second hand tacos! I was on a short lunch break and told the waitress I wanted two tacos to go. She insisted on putting in an order for a meal stating that it was cheaper (I doubt it). I asked for light onions and instead they gave me light cilantro and what looks like extra onions. Before eating I thought about returning it and getting what I asked for but had too much difficulty and decided to try them out. Omg let's just say these greasy Carne Asada tacos taste more like a breakfast sausage! I would return them but my pride is too big and I wouldn't dare want the little waitress to think it was about the price since I inquired about single tacos vs a meal:("}
{"text":"Had dinner at Sir Veza and I have to say review of this place is 1 out o f 5.  The food was not very good, margarita was very weak, rice tasted like it came from a box. No flavor in the Carne asada tacos, shrimp was good. My sons chimi very dry and bland. The waiter was not customer service friendly. Never again will we go, only positive thing was the manager discounted 22% off the bill."}
{"text":"I have been to Sir Veza's two times now and I am only mildly impressed. The service has been pretty good but the food is just okay. My fiance has really enjoyed the burger's here but I have not liked either of the items I have tried. On our first visit I tried the Johnny Las Vegas roll which is kind of like a sushi style roll but it's not seafood. Instead it is a mixture of chicken, cream cheese, jalapeno, chipolte sauce and maybe a couple of other items thrown in all wrapped up in a chimichanga type of wrap. I did not care for this at all. It kind of tasted like chicken salad to me which I cannot stand. If you like chicken salad, you might like this, if you hate mushy texture, you will hate it.

I did also try the La Bomba soft pretzel with strips of poblano peppers and swiss cheese and served with nacho cheese dipping sauce and mustard, I did like this a lot. On our second visit which was on New Years day I tried the Sonoran Dog. I did not care for this either. For me the hot dog itself was way too salty. The beer battered fries are however delicious. On New Years day they also had a DJ at 7:30pm who was just bumping beats the entire time we were there. It seemed like he was trying to turn the place into a night club. The music selection was terrible, with rap songs melding into country. It was extremely off putting. My fiance and I could not carry a conversation because of the mini night club situation. The DJ was the only one dancing and was clearly enjoying himself very much.

If it were up to me I probably would not come back. My fiance does love the burger here so we will probably give it another shot. If we do come back I will try the tacos on the next visit. We will also probably come early in the day on a weekday. I'm not up for the rap/country/pop mash up night club."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Carnitas burrito was amazing. Beer is priced very good and if it is your birthday you can get a free birthday shot. Sitting at the bar is the best seat in the house and of Chuck is your bartender you will not be disappointed. He knows his stuff and gets anything you want super fast. If you are contemplating coming here...DO IT!!!"}
{"text":"Nice, laid-back place with decent food and drinks but expensive for what it is (outside of happy hour)."}
{"text":"They made us wait 25 minutes for 4 vegan tacos and then brought the wrong ones.... I said to the waitress that I didn't want them remade because it took 25 minutes to make and I didn't want to wait another 25 minutes to get the correct tacos. She said \" oh ok\" and took the tacos away. 

The guacamole legit tasted watered down and I had to add salt, pepper and hot sauce to make it edible. 

This was a BAD experience and I'm not happy at all... when your kitchen messes up you should say something more than \"OH OK\" and you should also ensure that IF I was to get it remade it wouldn't take 25 freaking minutes for VEGAN TACOS."}
{"text":"What a piece of s*** company they sit there on the corner of the block and they can't even serve a man a drink accusing him of being drunk when he walked in there not knowing nothing so we left and we were at the Buffalo Wild Wings to everybody there leave that s*** alone and let them deal with the car out front what a piece of s*** company"}
{"text":"Love the food. I highly recommend the tacos. I usually get the diablo shrimp. Way overpriced. Almost worth it the money, but I like to splurge so I go here often."}
{"text":"Affordable beer for an airport. The carnitas burrito was very filling and tasty. Definitely my favorite spot at Phx Sky Harbor airport!"}
{"text":"This place is a bar and twice we had great service and twice terrible service. I think I remember getting so pissed once that I complained to the manager.  I particularly love the Diablo shrimp tacos that are half price on Tuesday. Very big and two filled me up. Once I tried to eat three tacos and it almost killed me. I don't like the beans but I like the rice. They give you a French fry alternative option with the tacos which are good I just don't like fries with my tacos cause you know mixing France and Mexico isn't a good idea. I also love the mango tea which is a good alternative to Pepsi which I won't drink. We tried the desert and I wasn't impressed it had ice cream and hot sauce which is too fancy for me.  Note this is my go to place for shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place before a movie. I ordered the taco salad with chicken. It was HUGE but the chicken was cubed and NOT fresh at all. I ACTUALLY hurt my tooth on one piece. You can tell they make the batch early and then let it sit. Out food came in like 4 minutes.... So if fresh quality food matters to you. I would skip it. Now I have 3 stars because the waitress did handle it well. She got the manager and it was taken off our bill. They offered to replace but I just wanted popcorn at that moment. So I was happy with how they dealt with it. Maybe I got unlucky? I usually NEVER say anything because I get embarrassed. but this was gross. I am sad. I thought we found a new spot. We tipped the waitress based on the original bill since she did a good job fixing thing. Not her fault they cut corners on the kitchen."}
{"text":"Had a few hour layover on Phoenix and decided to sit down at this airport eatery ....let me tell you I've been through a lot of airports and I have very little expectations when it comes to airport food but this place was absolutely awesome bye far some of the best airport food I have ever had hands down !! You have to try the Nitro Nachos !!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy being taken for an idiot and eating mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with cool music, this is the place to go. 
First, the restaurant is very charming with its old garage like style, and they play good music (Smashing Pumpkins made the lunch more pleasant). That, unfortunately, is almost the only positive thing I can say.

We ordered a Coke and an iced tea, and we got - a diet coke. We notified the waitress and she brought a new one and explained in detail how the soda machine doesn't really work at the moment. No problem, but the explanation did not make much sense to us. Admit that it was a mistake, say sorry, and everything would be okay.
We got some chips and salsa for free and they were tasty.

For food we got a shrimp burrito with Guacamole (that we asked to have inside the burrito) and the Diablo Chicken Salad. Guess what, the burrito came with the Guacamole on the side and, for whatever reason, the salad that goes into a burrito also on the side. Husband said it tasted okay.

My chicken salad however, where do I start... it was supposed to be the grilled chicken with Diablo sauce, sesame seeds, edamame, kale, avocado and dressing. It was entirely lettuce, a few lonely edamame, three slices of avocado with some brown spots, pretty dry chicken, and not a single piece of kale. The one great thing was the Diablo sauce which was fruity, sweet and really spicy. I notified the waiter about the lack of kale, she left the table and came back with a menu and said there's no kale in the salad, it says \"edamame kale\" and edamame kale are the few tiny beans in the salad. I highly doubted that there is something like edamame kale but who knows, nowadays everything suddenly comes in new fancy varieties, so maybe there is an edamame kale that looks and tastes like normal edamame. We googled immediately - guess what, there is no such thing as edamame kale. Nice try fooling the customer. We looked at the menu again and it clearly says it has edamame and kale. Seriously, if she had told me they're out of kale, ok, or they forgot it, ok. But making up a ridiculous new vegetable that doesn't exist... come on.... I almost threw a Gordon Ramsey in that place, but I'll get my revenge now with this review [insert evil laughter here]. 
So, I paid $12 for a bowl of lettuce and a good laugh about \"edamame kale\"...

To make a long story short, the food is a joke, especially for the prices and the waitress lies in your face instead of admitting even minor mistakes. We will definitely never come back."}
{"text":"I should have stuck with a quesadilla but changed it to nachos. I kept eyeing the man's quesadilla next to me. I was tempted to offer a switch yet that would be an odd offering by a stranger.

The chips itself were fine. More on the thin, crisp side than the thicker crunch type of chip. I got 1 tablespoon of guac which was saddening. I got more sour cream than that. I'm not sure if they know what pico de gallo is because I had just diced tomatoes...no onion or cilantro which is another disappointment! ( i looked at old pics and it looked like they used to make pico de gallo w onion and cilantro...they may have forgot today) They also use cheese sauce. I don't mind it at baseball games but I love real melted cheese like they use on quesadillas. I opted for refried beans which were dry and likely canned..assuming by taste. The chicken did not taste seasoned and was fairly bland. Overall I wouldn't order again. 

Next time I'm in the airport, I may try the brasserie..even though that's a few dollars more."}
{"text":"This was a lovely surprise in the world of airport food. We ordered one order of Carne Asada Tacos and one order of Fish Tacos. Both were very flavorful and seasoned well. Tacos seem to be one of those things that all restaurants think they can do, but this place really can make a good taco. My husband and I agreed that the fish tacos were our favorite of the two. Pricing seemed reasonable, especially for an airport location and our order came up without a long wait."}
{"text":"The girl working the register was too busy talking to her coworkers to get my order right or to remember to give me the soft drink I ordered, but the  Birria burrito I got instead of the breakfast burrito I ordered was awesome. Great food, poor service."}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was not impressive. For the price I paid for a sirnoran hot dog I was expecting better taste. The bun was cold, I personally like the bun to be warm. We also order a taco salad, the taste was much better than the hot dog but the ground beef was cold. I think for a bar it looks pretty cool and the service is awesome, our server and manager were great, but for food I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent Nachos. Car Club Tacos, chimi style burito. Gypsy Rose cocktail was delicious"}
{"text":"One of the few places open for breakfast at Sky Harbor at 5:00 am. Cashier barely said a word and looked like she'd rather be anywhere else. I understand it's 5:00 am but if you're in the service industry some actual pleasantries should be expected. Oh yeah the food is pretty sub-par. As one who travels frequently I've tried the sliders and burrito and had better stuff out of a microwave."}
{"text":"Dropped into Sir Veza's Taco Garage on Thanksgiving morning with my family on the way out to California. Did not eat anything; this was about some liquid holiday cheer! 

Everything is served in Red Solo cups to keep track on who has a beverage, if ya catch my drift. 

Aside from the Tang, our bartender made a pretty good mimosa. Negra Modelo on tap. 

Also, the guy thought I had a Minnesota accent. Too funny. At the very least, thanks for giving this Northern California lady a good laugh! 

Prices seemed typical for airport drinks; however, when your awesome Pops is footing the bill . . . Who cares?!"}
{"text":"Although the chicken bowl I ordered had decent flavor, the chicken was absolutely dry, which kind of stinks. I feel like the price you pay is based on the meat, and if the meat is yucky, you just paid for pretty much nothing. Plus, they give you a little packet of salsa in a little plastic container like BBQ sauce from a fast food restaurant. That's when you know it's not good, fresh salsa, and you probably shouldn't open it unless you're desperate. I left mine in the bag. The price is rather high for what you get, which many reviews on here state. I should've read reviews prior to ordering, but it was enough food for me at that moment in time. I don't know when I'll be in Phoenix again, but I highly doubt I'd be going back to this place if I do."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way to a flight. Place my order and waited several minutes for the to go order. The girl (Destiny) called the number and by the time I got to the window she called final call and continued to argue with me back and forth 4-5 times saying she has called the number 3 times and its was now final. I asked if she had a bag for the to go order and she said yes and set the bag next to the order. I reminded Destiny that typically the customer is always right and she continued to argue then ignore. Discussed with manager and he refunded the money. I still would like to let the customer here beware of the young girl behind the counter. She is rude and I'm sure since its an airport location will go unnoticed by her employer."}
{"text":"So first off I feel it's important to say that this place is in the airport, which I feel colors the review. All in all the place is good for its location. That and the ability to leave an airport eatery with fairly interesting food and a good beer for $15 is pretty good. 

The style of the place is a hipster chipotle. Flavor is pretty good and not that inventive. Options are tacos, burritos and bowls w/ the same meat options as chipotle. So why not go to chipotle?  2 reasons, 1. There isn't one and 2. The beer. Again the beer.

So they have 20 different beers on tap, locales and national micro brews. They allow taste before you buy and are pretty good. 

3 on its merits, 4 because of an airport."}
{"text":"Experience at Sir Veza's on Aug 10th, 2017...a little late on writing this! I eat a Plant-Based Diet and was looking for a bite before my flight. I came across this place and approached to find out what they've got for me. I initially began to order a Bowl, but made some changes (no cheese, etc). Deborah W recognized what I was omitting and with approval from her manager, changed it to \"sides\" instead, saving me some $ and time altering their menu item. I got black beans/pico/peppers/avocado and corn tortillas. They were delicious! And Deborah was so sweet and patient with the order."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss... but when it's on, it's on. The shrimp diablo tacos are fantastic. The only thing lacking is the consistency with the food and service. 

Love the bar and the tequila selection is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Fish tacos from a tex-mex place IN AN AIRPORT?!?!

Call me desperate or call me calculated, but this place had some pretty darn good fish tacos!  Fresh tasting fish, tasty garnishes, and 4 flat screen TVs make this an ideal spot for me...and apparently a lot more people...the place was packed!

I was just tired of paying $15 for a $1.99 egg muffin style sandwich at SFO, so I held out until the flight landed in phoenix.

With a long layover and a growling stomach, I accepted the fact that I would need to eat somewhere...now I can't wait to come back!

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I went during happy hour and stayed for about 30 minutes. Everything was about average. The food to me taste more like Barfood. For some reason I was expecting higher quality food. Same with the beverages. The new trendy thing is to use fresh fruits and beverages not syrupy concentrates. I ordered and was a bit disappointed in the quality of product I received. I probably would not go back."}
{"text":"Sky Harbor is the best airport I have been to in terms of food. With quality offerings like Four Peaks, Humble Pie and La Grande Orange you have some great choice. I am adding another great little spot for your consideration with Sir Veza's. Tacos, burritos, salads and even burgers are on the menu. I ordered two chicken tacos with a side of black beans and rice. The tacos come wrapped in two soft corn tortillas (they also offer flour), grilled chicken topped with a chipotle crema, cilantro,  queso fresco, and fajita veggies. The crema had heat and made their salsa toppings irrelevant. The tacos are big so please don't be scared of the high price tag, you will be full. They are very generous with the protein and if you can find a seat in the crowded dining room you are all set."}
{"text":"We were at the mall and wanted to try something new so we stop into Sir Veza's.  We got a table very quickly, I think there staffing ratio was 3 to 1, perhaps training.  Although this didn't provide good service.   When ordering a beer say glass not pint the waitress didn't know what a pint was the size.  Also make sure you are very specific on your beer order otherwise you will get the wrong one (as I did).  We try a few appetizers, mistake the first was covered in cheese whiz with a dollop of sour cream, I thing there were French fry bit swimming in there but wasn't sure.  The Jalapeño chicken sliders weren't too bad, but the onion straws with them were under cooked (no crunch at all).  And because of our massive food order it took a while for the food to arrive at our table.  And even though this place had a whack of staff obtaining a refill of salsa or chips was not an easy task.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"This is our first time coming back and we were so thrilled to see our absolutely favorite server ever JOE!!! He is truly the best server I have ever met. You will not be disappointed if you ask for Joe."}
{"text":"When your flight has been delayed because too many planes are trying to get into Phoenix for the big game - it's nice to have places to kill some time at and grab a little something to eat too!

This place - at least when I was there - had great staff, the pricing wasn't bad - food tasted great and they were not slow - even though I had time to kill. Seemed clean, but it was just really the same ole same ole. However, I wouldn't hesitate to return!

Perhaps more for a drink than a dinner!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, not so happy with the food.

I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of Sir Veza's but I've been reasonably happy with what I've eaten at the restaurant in Chandler and the one in Tucson. But of course, just like other places that have gone into PHX lately, the airport incarnation fell short of the original. My husband got a burrito and customized it to be low carb (relatively speaking). They were willing to substitute the onions and peppers that come on the tacos in place of the rice and beans in the burrito, which was nice. However, they definitely did not add any extra meat and so the burrito was still pretty small and mostly tortilla. I also attempted to be healthy and ordered a taco salad which was anything but. Apparently they make it with a friend greasy flour tortilla smeared with refried beans at the bottom. Which wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't for the fact that there was a woefully small amount of lettuce. And it was of the wilted iceberg variety. However, to their credit they did remember to leave off the sour cream so that was much appreciated. 

The main reason they earned three stars was the staff. The woman who took our order was friendly, efficient, and helpful. Another girl was working hard to keep the place clean in spite of the crowds and even got me an ice tea refill. That was good since our flight departure ended up being delayed so I had plenty of time to drink it."}
{"text":"I got the fish tacos here and they were excellent! Not sure about the rest of the menu, but looks like your basic run-of-the-mill TexMex joint.  Not bad for an airport, and right next to a fantastic coffee spot!"}
{"text":"Super fun and our new Friday night spot! Love DJ, all dance music and good vibes! Matt was amazing and was attentive all 4 hours we were there! Michelada's are amazing, burnt Brussels and ribs are top notch!"}
{"text":"I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. I ordered the bean dip to start with the chips and salsa. It was delicious. The chips and salsa were OK but not that good.  I ordered the nachos. When they came out they were huge.  They were filling and tasty.  The server we had was awesome. He was running back and forth to make sure we always had everything we needed.  Needless to say we tipped him well.  The ambiance of the restaurant is great because it is kind of inside, but no walls so you can see outside.  The have a DJ every day.  I feel bad because they are in the infamous cursed location of Chandler Mall.  No place ever lasts there. I can't say I for sure would eat here again without the Living Social deal I got for this restaurant. It is a little pricey.  The Nachos are definitely worth the money, but from what I can see on the Yelp pictures it looks like everything else may be a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I got the bowl [which comes with guacamole, blak beans, rice, salsa, cilantro, chipotle crema] and for the meats I chose Barbacoa and carnitas. I wasn't expecting much for the quantity, the quality is average. Didn't have much meat in my bowl. If you're looking for airport food that'll satisfy your hunger for an hour or two, get what I got! Good for those who don't want to be on the plane with a full stomach. =]"}
{"text":"So the fish tacos? FREAKIN' AH-MAZING! 
But the communication between the FOH & BOH was basically non-existent. 

I'm sure things would run a lot more smoothly if they worked together more."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting and it made me ill. Ordered eggs and they didn't even taste like eggs."}
{"text":"Most don't go to the airport and expect great food or cheap drinks.  Even with lowered expectations this place fails to meet.  I have been to this airport several times, found several places that I would return without issues.   This one was not one of them."}
{"text":"I walked all the way to the C terminal to try this place out. My flight was out of the B terminal. Staff was nice and sweet. I had the chicken tacos and a local brew. Tortillas were soft but the filling was delish'"}
{"text":"The taco salad was awful. Refried beans looked like they came straight out of the can, not heated. Couldn't tell if beef was ground chunks or pieces and no salsa....
Slider burgers were all filler. 
Panera has got to be better if you have to stand with your food."}
{"text":"1 star for the good fries. Food was tasteless: My husband's hamburger was over cooked and very dry (even though he ordered it 'pink in the middle'), my son's burger was dry bun with tiny piece of meat and cheese. Pork and fish tacos were lacking seasonings, however compared to the hamburgers were ok. Probably this is good 'happy hour' place but don't waste your money on the food."}
{"text":"I'm sitting a couple of feet away from Sir Veza's as I wait for my flight to board. I had some time to kill and was very interested in a drink and at this gate Sir Veza's satisfied both of those requirements. Their menu is simple, I ordered a burrito with grilled chicken and a \"sky harborita\". Their layout is kind of weird because anywhere you stand to wait for your food and drink will be blocking either people getting drinks at the bar or people behind you waiting to order. 

Anywho, I got my burrito and drink and after a few minutes snagged a seat at a table. The harborita did it's job for $5 and the burrito was actually pretty good. Black beans, cheese, rice, meat, and a side of chile verde which was flavorful and I'm glad I dipped my burrito in it. If the burrito ($7.95) were a dollar cheaper or a little bigger, I probably would have no complaints. This is a pretty good joint and would eat here again"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Not only did they bring me the wrong order but when it was corrected, new dish was cold. Very expensive and do not plan on coming back."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot to eat when I fly out of Phx, AZ. Its located by the gate so its real convenient. According to the other reviews I guess Im the only one who orders the cheeseburger sliders with fries and an Ice tea!
Been here three time and haven't had a bad meal yet. The folks are very nice, you stand in line and they call you when its done. there is limited seating but i've always found a seat. or folks can go out into the seating area and eat as well.
The sliders are cooked just right, not dry with just the right amount of greasiness! The fries are very crispy and not over salted, Plus they don't put pepper on them, don't like pepper on my fries.
Just the right amount of food to make it to Atlanta! the price is a bit high but its an airport restaurant. What do you expect? Anyway I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places to visit in Arizona. What more can you ask for. Shopping, alcohol and good food. I love that they are located right in the mall.  Their Mechiladas are delicious and refreshing. The outdoor seating is very comfortable."}
{"text":"I have been a longtime patron of Sir Veza's Taco Garage; it is the only part of traveling that I enjoy. I looked forward to getting a breakfast burrito from Sir Veza's before jumping on a long flight across the country. Everything was great! Until I talked them up to my family and insisted we go get a breakfast burrito before a family vacation to Minnesota. I was so excited for them to try it. Well, my wife wasn't hungry, so she didn't order, just my brother and I ordered. The burritos came out astonishingly fast, as they usually do. My brother and I began devouring our burritos until after the second bite we looked at the now chewed off ends of the burrito. To our horror, we saw green eggs. Before you ask dear Yelpers, it was not St. Patrick's Day, and there was not a special Dr. Seuss promotion going on. 

My brother was worried he would now get sick on our flight, and so was I. We googled what it meant to get green scrambled eggs and found a few answers. It was likely cooked at too high a temperature on an iron based cook top or pan. The combination of the two causes the yolks to oxidize and creates sulfur dioxide or iron oxide or something like that (go ask Bill Nye). It is perfectly safe to eat, though the sulfur laden fart smell is hard to choke down. We did not end up getting sick. 

What has made me sick is the arduous process my wife has had to go through to get our refund processed. We were told by a \"manager\" that the refunds would go through in a couple days. We went on vacation for eight days and didn't think much about it. When we got back to Phoenix (late at night, after Sir Veza's was closed), the refund still hadn't processed. Now, we are talking ten or eleven dollars here. Not exactly breaking anyone's bank, but my wife and I try and live by some simple principles, and one is never to pay for something you didn't receive.

I called the store on July 13th, 2015 to ask about the refund. The manager I spoke with said she would look into the issue and call me back. No call on Tuesday. No call on Wednesday. So my wife called. She spoke to a woman named Maria who told her employee to say she wasn't there and to take a message (yes Maria, my wife could hear everything you were saying). Maria identified herself as the assistant manager.

Maria claimed that she called me and left a message, she did not. My wife asked to verify the phone number Maria had called (my wife is an indefatigable defender of truth and honesty) and the question was brushed aside almost expertly by the \"assistant\" manager. Maria tried hard to get out of having to do anything at all but agreed to call the district office. She would then call me the following day when the transaction was complete (I still have not received a phone call). Satisfied that we would finally get some justice (because we really could care less about $10/$11), My wife agreed to let bygones be bygones; but not before she asked if Maria had found that phone number she allegedly called and left a message for me. Remember my wife's tenacity? Maria blurted out a number that wasn't even close and kind of trailed off at the end. Do phone numbers now only have six digits?

There has been NO resolution. My wife called again today and found out from an ill-informed employee that Maria is, in fact, the GM of the area. We have been told that everything should be resolved today and that I will get a phone call when it has been submitted. I am not holding my breath. What's that saying? If a dog bites you once? Well... Hopefully, the same principle doesn't apply to green eggs or general managers named Maria...

I have nothing against Sir Veza's food despite my experience. I understand that mistakes happen and that being unreasonable about situations never helps get the results you want. My wife also understands this. In fact, she would tell you, despite all the pains, that Sir Veza's at Sky Harbor Airport makes the best Bloody Marry in Phoenix. We are simply upset that we have been brushed aside by this company's employees and management over a measly amount of money.

There was only one apology in this whole debacle that I am aware of. When the manager (it may have been Maria for all I know) originally tried to process the refund. She said, \"Sorry... we just got new eggs\". To which I thought, \"Did we get the old ones then\"?

So I, along with four of my colleagues and my brother, are swearing you off. It breaks my heart. Though, companies with terrible customer appreciation/service don't deserve our business. A little gratitude and sympathy could have gone a long way. A simple, \"I'm sorry this has been such a difficult process\" would have spoken volumes to their dedication to retaining a loyal customer base. Instead, we are all done with you. Well... except my wife, she is steadfast in her determination to get a refund. Also, she will be back for a Bloody Marry next time she travels. Seriously. They are that good."}
{"text":"Wow, unfortunately what a let down.  

This was my second visit came here a while back for some drinks and had a pleasant experience I figured we'd stop again and this time try some tacos.  Place wasn't busy my any means as there were tables open. We sat at the bar top.  

The bar top was filthy, food crumbs and dirty glasses everywhere not just where we were sitting.  The bar tender came and I thought he'd wipe the top down. Nope my mistake for thinking he would do it without me having to ask.   I look over to the end of the bar and the entire corner was evidently conquered by an army of dirty dishes, pint glasses, plates, and pitchers.  The bar tender just went about his business taking orders and ignoring the mess. He brought us our beers and once again didn't even make an attempt to wipe away the previous three meals that were all over the top.  

My desire to eat quickly faded, as I wondered if they were this messy out in the open I can only imagine how filthy they are behind the scenes.   

Such a disappointment as this place has potential and I like the garage decor and feel.  But I will never go back to a place that blatantly disregards cleanliness."}
{"text":"The chip's and Salsa are good, but the happy hour sliders were not all that great. I ordered a Mango Margarita and my waitress for got to put my order in so I never got it."}
{"text":"I was stuck in the Phoenix International Airport for 2.5 hours longer than expected during a flight delay one Saturday evening and was getting hungry. After walking around checking out all the different restaurants in the terminal I finally found Sir Vesas.

There aren't too many good places to eat in this airport (but plenty of average ones) so I chose Sir Vesas for the three star average and their more than one Vegetarian Option. I ordered the Bean and Cheese Burrito and it was about $7 which isn't too expensive for airport food. The burrito was pretty good. Black beans, cheese, sour cream and salsa inside a flour tortilla. Nothing bad, nothing great. Just ok.

I might come back to Sir Vesas again if I was in the same terminal at Phoenix International. I wouldn't traverse multiple terminals to get here, but if I was there then it's not a bad option. They have a nice bar area as well as a small seating area which makes for a nice place to relax if you can find a spot."}
{"text":"We had a layover and looked forward to a nice cup of soup while waiting. What we got was a salt lick of tortilla soup and when we attempted to alert the counter server, Trisha, of our dislike, we were dished up a huge helping of bad attitude. Total rudeness topped with no eye contact.

This was not at all what we expected. What happened to service with a smile?

We cannot recommend Sir Veza's to any future terminal 4 visitors."}
{"text":"My experience here was nothing spectacular but overall decent. I sat at the bar and had a cheese crisp with green chilis and a sangria. They make their own sangria daily and it was good, not too sweet and they even offered to sub the sprite for club soda. Great bartenders, crisp chips and good salsa.

It was the perfect segue from a hot car to some serious shopping at Macy's"}
{"text":"We love Mexican and are pretty picky about it. I have been here twice and thought it was excellent both times! The margaritas and chips and salsa are both delicious! (And that's the true test of yummy Mexican right?!) I had the chopped salad and it was very good. Huge portion. The kids meals have great options which we love as well. Service was great both times we went.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Beverages are only offered in plastic cups! This is such an immense contribution to the plastic pollution problem. In an establishment that does not offer beers \"to go\", there is no excuse not to use glass."}

Our server was nice and energetic and made some great recommendations for food and beverage options. I ordered one of the specialty margaritas, the Gypsy Rose, that had Patron Silver, prickly pear and lime. It was just the perfect amount of sweet and sour. I also ordered a second marg at happy hour, a strawberry marg on the rocks. Also delicious.

We ordered the chimi bites and the $2 tacos on Tuesday. The chimi bites were amazing. The $2 tacos....not so much. I was almost full when I got them, but I thought they lacked flavor. I want to try some of the regular plate tacos next time because those sounded really great. The \"new\" shredded beef or chicken tacos look delicious.

For the price and the variety of specials, this place is a good find!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! I'm never in this area but there are tons of options to go eat. Let me tell you this should be on your list. It's really cool (just like a mechanic shop) and the food is pretty good. I recommend"}
{"text":"If you're really hungry, don't hesitate to eat here!  There's a lot of food.  The service couldn't really get any better either.  Not a bad experience!  I'd say 4 stars is about right."}
{"text":"Worst burrito I've ever had! Stale tortilla, undercooked rice, poorly cooked vegetables, zero seasoning. You give them $9 and they give you something to throw directly in the trash."}
{"text":"Sir Veza's has great happy hour prices with drinks and appetizers very affordable!  I, however, ordered a dinner of two tacos with charro beans instead of refried.

My friends who ordered off of the HH menu all got the bbq pork sliders which came with two sliders and fries--$5!!!

I, who ordered off of the regular menu, was able to choose from about 8-10 different fillers for my tacos.  I chose the shredded chicken and the carne asada which is a dollar more.  The shredded chicken was really good, but I wouldn't recommend the carne asada--too dry and small chunks of steak.  (Maybe I'm not a carne asada fan.)  They let me get more beans because I don't eat white rice.  I also liked that I could get charro beans (but not the kind I'm used to) instead of refried beans.

It's a fun place and attracts a young crowd."}
{"text":"Got to this Taco Garage before a morning flight.  No line and I initially intended to grab a protein drink and yoghurt.  I saw breakbeat bowls on the menu so figured that would fit in my low carb diet.  The cashier asked if there anything I did NOT want in it from the list of options.  I asked for no carbs and no sour cream.  I was this expecting eggs, turkey sausage, cheese, black beans, jalapeños. 
After waiting about 10 minutes I was given a large container with the above and 90% tortilla chips!

WTF and what a rip off since most of the container was the chips.  I picked out what I could. Check the picture attached."}
{"text":"My first instinct was to discount this place based on its cheesy name, but the lure of a Groupon brought me in. And oh my goodness, it was delicious! 

I tried 3 tacos (the beef with zucchini was my favorite), and my lady got the SirNoran dog. Holy cow, what a hot dog! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Passing through Phoenix airport and ordered a vegetarian bowl.  It cost more than $8 and I left a tip.  Opened the bowl to find about 1/3 cup of rice and 1/3 cup of black beans, plus a sprinkle of fajitas and a tablespoon of sour cream and tablespoon of guacamole.  In other words, it was very, very little food for the price I paid.  Also it was quite greasy and over-salted.  

Airport food, sigh."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great carne asada. I wish this was a restaurant I could go to at home. The service was great. The bartender tonight was super sweet and made sure the whole bar was taken care of. Cashier was also great! 
Carne asada bowl was delicious. Meat was tender and flavors were great. Fantastic atmosphere for the World Series!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to all the food options at the Chandler Mall .. located next to the food court by the valet.

I've been to the 2 locations in Tucson also and they never disappoint.. 

On today's visit I had a jack & Coke with a generous pour.. yum! I then saw a michelada being fixed across the bar and I had to have one .. you need two hands too lift this baby off the bar .. they dunk the beer bottle in it and the rim has the lime spice .. tajin.. delish and very filling!!

For lunch I had two grilled fish tacos, with a side of rice & charro beans.. tasty.. I had the mamacita hot sauce for some kick. 

The menu and happy hour menus have tons of great options .. the staff checks on you regularly.. good stuff!"}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself waiting for your flight and you're 21, spend that time at Sir Vezas with a michelada. It's absolutely delicious! It's not a fully stocked bar but you can choose from beer, wine, margaritas and bloody mary's. Food was as good as bar food gets. I had a steak bowl that was almost as good as chipotle. New favorite airport spot :)"}
{"text":"What a beer for $3!  Yep, at Sir Veza's.  The help started by asking us if we wanted a quiet location which we did.  That's important because there's karaoke here.  We ordered a mix of drinks from wine to beer to margaritas.  All were good.  For dinner, I ordered a burrito covered in red sauce.  It was excellent and really too much for one person.  My wife had a pulled pork taco and a veggie taco.  Both tacos were good.  We choose this restaurant because it was close to our hotel but glad we found it.  We'll be back during the next Spring Training."}
{"text":"As far as airport food goes, this is pretty daggone good  I've had the carnitas breakfast tacos (corn) twice and they are delish as well as great hangover food. It would be THAT much better if the salsa were fresh, but it's not terrible. 

Prices are fair too. It's pretty filling - can't completely finish them - out the door it's about $12."}
{"text":"It's hard to fail at nachos, and I had the blandest nachos I've ever had, despite the beans, cheese, jalapeños, guac, sour cream, and pico de gallo piled on top. I'm not even sure which topping it was that tasted like cardboard because it ALL kinda tasted like variations of paper. 

The space is small, and you order and then stand around blocking everybody else while you wait for your number to be called so then you can nudge your way back to the front. 

I'm only adding a star because they seemed to have a decent beer variety on tap, although I didn't get any because there was no place to eat inside the premises."}
{"text":"Bartender by the name of Giovanni greeted us with the worst customer service ever. We went to sit at the bar and have a couple drinks before our connection and we were greeted with \" Just to let you folks know that if someone comes up and wants to drink I have to ask you to find another seat. \" I looked at my husband very confused because that was our plan to get drinks.   So I looked at him and said what makes you think that's not what we were going to do? He said \"I don't know what your plan is, I just have to tell you that.\"  My husband looks at him and says \"I have never been greeted like that walking into a restaurant or up to a bar before.\"  He looked right at us and said \"I'm sure the full service bar down the way would love to serve you guys\".  I was completely dumbfounded as to what had just occurred. We had actually been to this same restaurant two nights ago while flying through and had great service and good food from a female bartender.  I said \"we were just here two nights ago and had much better service.\" .  He said \" well I wasn't here\".  My husband looked right at him and said \"no, no you weren't and we will be taking our business to that full service bar down the way just like you recommended, have a good night\".   If there was a no star option trust me that is what it would get!"}
{"text":"Best vegan fajitas I've ever had. We told Sierra we were in a hurry and she made sure everything came out quickly. She was also super knowledgeable about the menu, extremely attentive, and so so nice! The food was excellent, but Sierra is the reason for 5 stars!"}
{"text":"What a great spot @ the Chandler Mall.
Stopped in yesterday while taking a break from shopping.

Bartender greeted us right away & we requested to sit out side on the patio & people watch. 

Our server came quickly and took our drink orders. Got the Diablo Wings & Queso Dip. Great prices throughout the menu. The Happy Hour deals you can't beat. $4.95 for many popular appetizers. Delish eats, however the wing sauce was a little sweeter than we had expected. Would have liked more heat! Still delicious! 

Prickly Pear iced tea is unusually tasty & a much try!

A fun place! Great concept which gears itself as a garage style atmosphere. The napkins are actual red mechanics rags! 

The wait staff friendly. Attentive and professional.

Nice menu choices and fair prices."}
{"text":"My friends wanted to try this place for the first time on his birthday and it ended up being a horrible experience. After two drinks they cut everyone off! So we decided to leave of course and the staff over heard where we were going and called that bar to tell them not to serve us! Unbelievable! We did nothing wrong, were very calm and polite and I can tell you, no one was near drunk off of two drinks! We will never go there again."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and love it! The enchiladas that came in a skillet were amazing.  My husband had the carne asada burrito which was really good as well.   No gristle like some places have.   We really enjoyed the music too.   Great food and atmosphere.  We'll definitely be back.   P.S. And a quick shout out for the chips and salsa ;-)"}
{"text":"Pretty good for airport food! I had fish tacos and they were definitely fresh and tasted good. There was also a decent amount of fish in the tacos. I wish it came with guacamole though, that would have made them a lot better. Also, they're are a bit on the smaller side so if you're really hungry, one order may not suffice. Luckily, I only needed a light lunch, and these tacos hit the spot. I think the tacos have the least bang for your buck compared to the burritos or the bowls (I could get a lot more food at Chipotle for the cost of the two tacos I got), but I was really craving tacos so I went for it. However, I would come back if I was ever in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Fun place with a great atmosphere, good food and great drink specials. Definitely a good place for a happy hour aka Garage Sale. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Well damn, over $16 for 8 mini chimi bites, and a beer.

The bites had very little filling, but were otherwise tasty.

Even for being inside the terminal, the price was high.

I only eat in the airport when I'm delayed, as I was this evening.

Might return, but odds aren't high."}
{"text":"Actually didn't try the food. Stopped into to grab something to eat after a long day of travel. Bartender closing down his register,  kitchen was getting cleaned up, waitresses were closing out and and doing side work.  When I  asked if the restaurant is still open the rude bartender pointed at the gate across from me and said when that plane leaves they close.  

I walked out of there, who wants to eat at a place that is 99 percent closed down and on top of that they weren't even inviting and said hey we're closing down but don't worry about it,  come on in and grab something we will take care of you.

Stay open till you close."}
{"text":"The 5 stars is solely based on their Bloody Mary. Comes in a red cup and its spicy upon request. Perfect before a flight."}
{"text":"I know this spot is cursed, due to many restaurants closing at this spot. However, this place seems like the new touch of tuscon desert needs and fills a valid role in Chandler fashion square. To be honest I was not willing to go at first and got dragged here by my significant other. To explain the service I doubt I could do it justice. They were willing to let us sample all their flavors from cheese to several of the beers before deciding. They were very attentive and caring for a chain restaurant. I understand this is the fifth in the chain. The food was great. Actually the portions were larger than expected and the flavor was not skipped. I have tried at least three of the tacos. Not to mention diet friendly for my vegan and gluten free friends. Just wow. I don't normally dish out a four star rating a first time but this place really has it. Even the rice is good. Something most places overlook. It's blooming with cilantro and flavor."}
{"text":"Second time we ate here at Chandler mall.  The service sucks and the food is worse. I don't think this place will last long. Even the manager comped us drinks because the food was so bad and the servers kept walking by.  What a dump!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. The food is just not that great. The restaurant is pretty cool though, I'd definitely drink here!"}
{"text":"The menu said they have Vegan,Vegetarians andGF option...this place is a joke.
Order a vegan option and it came with some chicken and shreds cheese in it , seems like the people in the kitchen are not aware of what cross contamination is or the difference between vegan vegetarian. 
We tried the place again because we enjoy the atmosphere, order a 3 tacos pkate vegan option and again found  meat in it.
If you have different options on the menu you need to know the right way to prepare the food.
Very dissapoited, we won't be back for sure"}
{"text":"Got the bacon breakfast taco on a layover. Pretty odd and greasy-the tortilla was fried on the griddle, I believe. Definitely not a traditional breakfast taco, the salsa was closer to ketchup. I can't comment on the other food options, so the stars are for breakfast tacos only. The service was friendly, though."}
{"text":"My second time here and the food is very consistent. .the prices are great the service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly. .must stop in"}
{"text":"High hopes, big let down. :( 
We came on a slow Sunday afternoon hoping for a fun girls lunch. Unfortunately service was slow, drinks were either all ice or really watered down... heir bloody Mary's were translucent pink... sad. Food was bland. Tacos were solar to what I make at home... not worth the money. :( 

Only plus was good 90s music and chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out at the mall. We will definitely be back to watch games and hang at the bar. The garage theme is cool, and it'll be great to hang out on the patio in the spring.  The shrimp tacos and carne asada tacos were excellent. portions are big, not those little sample size tacos. Try it out if you are at the mall or looking for a good place to day drink or go for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here on a Thursday as I was leaving the mall, to my surprise found out every tequila is half priced..EVERY Thursday! The bartender Colby was super sweet and told me a ton about the background of some of the menu items and cocktails. Although I heard they are known for their gourmet street tacos I took a risk and ordered the Shrimp Stuffed Chile Rellano and man I'm sure happy I did! It had bacon, avocado, tomatoes, queso fresco and so much more goodness inside.  In addition to the classic sides of rice and beans they also included a zucchini and squash blend that was served in some sort of really taste sauce. I probably would of tried to squeeze in dessert if they're complimentary chips and salsa weren't so good! LOL 
Also the Pink Paloma margarita is served with this grapefruit soda in a massive glass and I highly recommend trying one! Everything was great, I will certainly be back next Thursday to try the tacos...and more tequila."}
{"text":"Usually a great place to go but today, not so much. Had a bartender ignore me to spend her time making free drinks to an employee drinking beside me.  The best part was an employee screaming \"Mother f*cker\" while standing at the food window with kids in the restaurant.  She laughed; cooks laughed. It was sad.  The only redeeming part was the bartender helping me...She was awesome:"}
{"text":"Very cool taco and hot dog \"garage\"

I'm a new fan of Sir Veza's. Stumbled across the place when we decided to have lunch at the mall and yet wanted to avoid the food court. Yelp'd it and... What? A 4-star place here? Their food shall be had. Onward!

The concept is a garage restaurant-- garage decor, mechanics rags for napkins, staff in biker apparel, et al.  Cool look and vibe, along with lots of TVs to catch the games on while eating.

Menu is mainly tacos, salads, and a big sonoran hot dog. That latter was yummy as bucks. And the kids menu hit the spot with our little girls. 

A bit slow on the service and the young lady kept forgetting things in her rush. She was nice enough though and I forgive her attempt to give me diabetes with an Arnold Palmer so sweet that my relations felt the pucker. She's young and with some additional experience, she'll be rocking it.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place to have a beer in the Chandler Mall. I would suggest coming here before going to Kona which everyone goes to and they have limited beer menu. Taco Tuesdays half-off absolutely the best value in town love this place love the atmosphere love the service everything about this place is great.

I just read the reviews..... Kona is ok... really... but this place is
1. Funner 
2 better beers
3. Nice servers with fun upbeat attitude 
4 really professional
5. Did I say great attitude ...
6. Smart and very time motion conscience 

Love Kona.... sorta
Love this place much better"}
{"text":"Happy Customer.  I had the Sonoran Dog with beer battered onion strings. Both were good.  The other item is a burrito with shaker style very big and very filling.  Margaritas as well."}
{"text":"Bar staff was great, food was on par, and the beer selection was also pretty impressive for an airport. There are no dishes in the place and they assume all food is \"to-go\" so almost every order comes in a Styrofoam container which was somewhat off-putting.

If you're saving money on BOH staff, one would think you could splurge on containers that are biodegradable. Pricing here was good too, so maybe using these containers is an excuse to keep the prices low, who knows.

Ultimately, I dug this place, it's just too bad they can't take it easy on those Arizona landfills. As a native, I know this state is not very environmentally minded and accept that this is a typical practice of the area which makes me a little sad."}
{"text":"Food: bland, small and way overpriced. I had the beef burrito blah

Atmosphere: cool, but small. I usually walk by this place and it's packed, but probably because there are only a few chairs at the bar

Service: horrible. 8am in the morning, 4 girls working and none of them had a friendly attitude. I was at the cash register ready to order for 30 seconds waiting for the girls to finish their conversation. No apology, no good morning, nothing... The pick up girl was just as unfriendly. Called my number for pickup and not a word.

This was my first and last visit."}
{"text":"There are almost no restaurants in this terminal, and this one was right next to my gate. I have been craving chips and queso, so I ordered some. I was very disappointed that it took 20 minutes to get a small take out box of chips and a teeny bit of queso on top. Normally, the cheese is in a small container on the side, especially in an establishment like an airport, but they didn't care when I said I'd rather have it on the side. They were very rude when I complained that I didn't have enough queso for the amount of chips I got, and they continued to said it would be another $5 for more queso! The price was already outrageous so I couldn't justify it. I ate 1/4 of my dish and had to throw out the rest of the overly fried chips. One star only because of the convenience of being next to my gate. Otherwise the customer service is horrible- the ladies look at you like you're bothering them, and roll their eyes when you ask for some napkins! Like it's such an inconvenience. I will not return when I come back to this airport, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas,  amazing fish tacos, and quick service for the experienced traveler."}
{"text":"Meals served in elementary school cafeteria trays, the paper under the burritos gets soggy and when you're done you realize you have eaten half of it and the service is incredibly slow. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Cocktails were great, food and service were also great. Recommend the nachos with pork, but be prepared to share. Even the half order is gigantic. Only complaint would be it's incredibly loud inside, and they only have one fan on the patio, which is not enough for the Arizona heat."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick beer before our flight. The bar features a large beer selection at pretty reasonable prices. They were served in red solo cups, which was a little odd, but kind of fun at the same time. We ordered from the counter as the bar was full. The beers came quick and the staff was friendly. We didn't try the food, but it looked good and was reasonably priced. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes to get a chicken burrito, and there was no line. There were more people behind the counter than waiting for food. Seriously, this is way too slow for airport food. Food is only so-so - Chipotle is better (and way faster)."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how much I liked Sir Veza's Taco Garage. While waiting for my connecting flight from SFO to IND, the Sky Harbor airport didn't seem to have many great options. For so many people on that busy day and in such a tiny airport, every food place seemed packed, including this one... but I followed my instincts and stood in line with my colleague.

Ordering took awhile, but everyone who works here is super friendly. I ended up getting the carnitas bowl. I took my box and found some seats at an adjacent gate since ours was too claustrophobic. With low expectations for airport food, I opened my box and my eyes widened. The juicy carnitas looked so delicious, smothered with vegetables and tons of sour cream, which is my Mexican food weakness. I inhaled the whole thing in less time than it took me to stand in line and get it. 

Though I wouldn't pick this Mexican spot over ones in San Francisco or San Diego, it definitely exceeded my expectations for airport food. Sir Veza's also has a bar area, though it was too crowded to sit there. If I had more time, and if it wasn't first thing in the morning, I would have loved to enjoy a margarita during that layover."}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos!! Best I've had since leaving San Diego! And the service was friendly and fast. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and service! Worth trying. Looking forward to warmer weather to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Being a Mexican snob, I was hesitant to come here. My mantra is \"the dirtier the location, the better the food\". From the moment I tried the salsa from the chips, I knew that this place was solid. 


Shredded chicken burrito California style. Get that and you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"$20 for a burrito and draft beer, $10 burrito with no sides and $7 beer. The burrito was pretty big for me, however everything was so bland. I had the carne asada and it was overcooked and dry, I had to add 2 sauces packs and a ton of hot sauce to add flavor. For the pros, it is a cool place to hang out if you have a long layover. Food was quick, friendly people, and tv to watch the game. If I was stuck in the terminal I would try again and order something different. Other people's food at the bar looked good."}
{"text":"Bartender is amazing and fun the staff is great. Go check them out when your on your way out of town."}
{"text":"Ok, this is not an ordinary airport restaurant. It's not the fastest service, but it is one of THE BEST fish tacos and the MOST INCREDIBLE green chili and cheese tamales I've ever had. And I've tried both at many, many restaurants. After spending 25 years living in Houston and traveling throughout the U.S. But since this restaurant is located in an airport most people enter with a bad attitude to begin with. The hassle of traveling, long lines, rude people...but people right next door to each other are two little gems in the Phoenix Sky Harbor Headache....Cartel Coffee and Sir Veza's Taco Garage.

Great sides also...guacamole, black beans and Spanish rice. Fish tacos available at breakfast too...big plus."}
{"text":"Decent food but a LONG wait! Avoid this place unless you have a lot of time in the airport! It took me about 30 minutes to get my food and they didn't even start half my order until I complained after 20 minutes! The other half of my order sat on the counter for 10 minutes getting cold!"}
{"text":"Customer service manager is extremely rude! After ordering a burrito and a fountain soda I had taken just a couple of sips and got a horrible taste from the unfiltered water that was used for their sodas. It was overwhelmingly bad and frankly undrinkable. I politely went up to ask if the cost of the bottled sodas were the same price because I didn't care for the fountain sodas. I was immediately asked what was wrong and explained that I could tell the water for the fountain was simply tap water and not filtered. If it was going to be an issue I was willing to pay the difference however before I could explain this to the manager, he grabbed the drink from me and threw it in the garbage and said \"Just grab whatever from the cooler I don't care\".  F&B management is something I do and THIS is definitely not a job for this guy. Bare in mind, my flight was delayed 3 hours and if I can keep my composure, I'm sure after a hard day, this bearded manager can find a way to exercise his patience and utilize his manager and customer service skills. He is setting a horrible example for the younger employees on how to treat customers. Let this behavior slide and your business will have bigger problems on their hands."}
{"text":"Gross! Last time it took 40 min to get my tacos and I didn't have time to eat them. This time I ordered a taco salad and it was disgusting an old. Nothing about it had anything to do with taco, no chips or shell. Will not give them a third chance."}
{"text":"The servers are really nice and friendly, but when it comes to beer selection they don't have that much variety. They have a decent amount of beer somewhat. They only have one type of IPA beer though ):"}
{"text":"Really excellent value for cost here, particularly for airport food. I ordered a breakfast bowl ($11) and easily could have shared with my spouse. It came with chips, black beans, eggs, green onions, green olives, chorizo (you select the meat you'd like) and a generous serving of sour cream and guacamole. My husband ordered the nachos - similar price, similar hefty toppings. The food was flavorful and mildly spicy. Again, better than a lot of airport food. The one drawback? There's not nearly enough seating."}
{"text":"Went for taco Tuesday. 50% off! Tacos were delicious and service was great. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far but I was pleased. My husband and I had lunch; I had a pork taco and salad while he had a pork carnitas bowl. The wait staff was great. We will go again."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing fish tacos ever!!
First off, they give you plenty of fish on your tacos unlike some places that get stingy with their fish.. They had lots of toppings on them, very flavorful... Probably one of the best fish tacos I've ever had!
As far as the atmosphere... I mean I'm eating at the one in the airport on my journey to Denver... It's not bad for what space they get to work with. 
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone flying or If there is another one is definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I had some nachos at the airport before a flight with my son and the cheese sauce served with the chips was absolutely disgusting (and I recently tried Chipotle's new queso so I know the true meaning of abysmal). The Lays brand in the jar in the chip aisle in the grocery store is much, much better. Everyone sitting around us was complaining about their food and throwing it away uneaten. I don't know if this if normal for Sir Veza's or just the airport location but I never eat here again."}
{"text":"After rushing to the airport and through security, we were starving while waiting for our flight.  Luckily, Sir Veza's was in our terminal. They were extremely busy, but it was worth the wait.

I got the veggie soft tacos, with 2 soft tortillas, black beans, rice, guacamole, and veggies. I don't know if my extreme hunger was factor or not, but these tacos were pretty darn delicious.  Like everything in the airport, they were over-priced, but when your options are limited and you didn't come prepared (like me), you'll gladly pay.  

Order at the counter, try to find a seat, and listen for your order number to be called."}
{"text":"Is this place still open? Closed shop with no signage on a Wednesday at 6 PM, stools and chairs put up on tables. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"Worthless piece of crap restrnt around. Staff all have attitude from hell.   Its dirty and food is sparse and marginal.   They advertise 2  tamales for $11.   They are frozen crap served with literally 2 teaspoons of rice and beans.  They charge for xtra sauce. This place is shameful for Sky Harbor Airport.  You are better to wait for peanuts on SWA . Only positive, they give free dink refills.  Just keeping it honest and fair."}
{"text":"Not exactly good.    Some where between bad and a low good.   Had the sliders and they were mystery meat.  Tasteless.  The only thing I could taste was the thousand island dressing. I'm always suspicious of a hamburger that is perfectly round.  But the fries we good."}
{"text":"Weak. I had a layover in the C terminal. I ordered the chips and queso. The chips were stale tasting and often fried together into one big cake. The queso made warmed velveeta seem flavorful. The Scottsdale Blonde was a nice beer. Overall - not a great experience - even for airport food standards."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the BEST happy hour! Everyday! 

The first time I went to Sir Veza's was in the Tucson location and it was just the worst experience ever. I've also been to the one at the Phoenix airport to grab a drink from time to time. So when this location opened I was hesitant to try it out and I'm so glad I did anyway!  I've tried so many items on their menu!

The sonoran dog is really good. It's a bacon wrapped hot dog, with beans, salsa, tomato, and it comes with fries. I've also had their Johnny Vegas which is really good. The cilantro cream cheese that comes with it is delicious. Now if you ever order their burrito bowls, make sure you are REALLY hungry because this thing is huge! I got the Go Shaker Chimi and couldn't even eat half of it. 

Their margaritas are also really good! and are usually on happy hour. I recommend the strawberry one on the rocks, Get the 14 bomb! 

The customer service has always been good. I love their outdoor patio. It is also dog friendly. (I've taken my little monster with me) And it even has a photobooth! What more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, perfect spot to come to before or movie or even while your shopping at the mall since it's attached to it.   Everytime we been here we been lucky to have the same bartender with the bandana and he's remembered us each time. 

The craft beer lineup is good and full of local breweries and if you want some good tequila shots they got that too.   I recommend the don Julio 1942 it's smooth and hits the spot. 

The food is really good you can't go wrong with anything,  and we showed up on a Sunday and it was happy hour was 3pm to close. 

If your in the area you have to check it out, haven't seen it to packed but real good vibe and friendly staff"}
{"text":"The food was pretty basic for Americanized Mexican food. What won me over was the service. Really on top of their game and I truly appreciated it with the accommodations they made."}
{"text":"I had about an hour to spare between early morning flights at Skyharbor and so decided to try out a new place.

I ordered the turkey sausage sliders as I hadn't seen those on a menu before.

I think everything is cooked fresh and so it took a few minutes to prepare (which was fine for me, but if you have to catch a flight that might not be great).

The bread buns were nice a light/fluffy - perhaps like brioche - the turkey sausage was kind of flavourless, the egg \"pancake\" was terrible, like microwaved frozen eggs terrible I honestly thought it was a pancake at first until I looked at the menu again.  There was some cheese present, but it had no taste.

I added both the salsa they give you and some sriracha I asked for, but nothing could save the sliders.

There was a side of fried potatoes/papas but they were very small pieces and had been overcooked.

Based on this meal I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"What a fun little place at Chandler mall! The food is good and the atmosphere is a lot of fun. We went on a Wednesday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all and we got amazing service from this waitress from Indiana. She knew all about the menu and was really personable 

I ordered the bio bowl which is the vegan option offered on the menu. It is full of veggies, beans, and rice and it really full of flavor. I got it with some red sauce to add a little more depth and flavor. It was really good. 

We also ordered a margarita pitcher which was well made and had chunks of fruit in it. A pitcher will run you about $27 and you'll get 4 drinks out of it total, not bad! They also have Pacifico on tap, which is awesome!

For desert I had the pumpkin tamale which was really good and supposedly vegan. They can also made their brownie desert vegan without an egg, but it takes 15-20 minutes to make. It's nice to see a restaurant catering to their customers. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came on 4th of July around 3pm. Ordered a frozen Margarita-/watermelon ranchero! Delicious- got an order of the mini chimes! Bomb"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star. After sitting at our table with no offer for a drink while we wait, we decided to get up and leave and go spend our money at BJ's across the way. Thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"Zero service. Food is given in take out containers. Nachos are served with fake cheese and they do not have jalapeños."}
{"text":"Came here between flights. Not a bad place to hang out and have a beer, but $10 for a burrito that only has beans, rice and meat? Not worth the money spend for food. Come catch a game between flights and a beer, thats about it."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican joint, Arizona-style. Definitely recommend if you're stuck by a delayed flight. Great service and free refills."}
{"text":"Tucson's Savory Invention: The Sonoran Hot Dog!

No need to go to a doguero [hot dog vendor] to get a Sonoran Dog in town.  Sir Veza's serves up their take on the Sonoran called, \"El Sirnoran.\"  El Sirnoran Dog is eight-inches of 100% Angus beef hot dog wrapped in applewood bacon with beans, jalapeño salsa, and tomatoes topped with a drizzle of mayo and mustard.  Knife and forking this bad boy isn't too embarrassing because holding this wiener to your lips is borderline NSFW but dang is it delicious.  I also tried their flavorful Enchilada Stack with shredded beef and topped with an egg.  I never had enchiladas topped with a fried egg before but I'm not sure I want to eat them without an egg ever again.  The yolk porn... my goodness! For drinks, I got the Mexican Mule which was okay. I liked my friend's Mint Condition Mojito a lot more!

They have an amazing Monday-Saturday Happy Hour menu from 3-7PM and 9PM-close.  I think I'll be back only for their Happy Hour specials.  As for their Sirnoran Dog, as good as it is, I rather get my dogs from a doguero at some local Mexican joints around town.  3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"For a reasonably cheap meal in an airport, Sir Veza's gets a FULL FIVE STARS. I had a DELICIOUS salad (hold the rice) that was seriously so good. I traveled for work for a bit of time, and airport food and I just don't love each other. I'm used to wilting lettuce on sandwiches, salads, and plates, and that's just disgusting but sadly expected in airport restaurants under $20/meal. Sir Veza's delivered. They have a small seating area, a quick line, free refills on fountain drinks if you stay in their area to eat, and a small bar with a handful of craft beers on top. If I visit PHX airport again, I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Our son just moved to Chandler and over Memorial Weekend our family of 6 decided to go here for dinner.  Were we surprised?? By far the best Mexican restaurant we have ever been too!! Our waiter Marcus was fantastic and the food was awesome!  We all tried something different and we all loved what we got. I ordered the chicken enchilada which was prepared a different way, that I loved!  You've got to order the guacamole because they come to the table to make it, so put everything in it, it's awesome!  Chips & Salsa are good too! We've been back 4 times in just a few short weeks. Can't say enough about this place. Loved it, loved it, loved it!"}
{"text":"It was a horrible experience today. We couldn't get the food after waiting for 20 minutes when our flight started boarding. No one told us it would take that long. Several other people could not get there food in time either. Also, they could not refund us because the manager was busy in the kitchen. We ended with no food and no refund when boarding our flight."}
{"text":"Great new concept from Tucson. Same food as el charro but set in casual, comfortable, cantina setting. A must try. Also @ airport"}
{"text":"Primarily a drinking place, and even though they have a decent quantity of taps, they don't have very good craft options.

Breakfast was overpriced and very mediocre.  This place plays second fiddle to Los Taquitos in the next row of restaurants over that has much better burritos."}
{"text":"I have to say I wasn't overly fond of their beer selection. I did like their guacamole. They make it at your table and there was lot, but that's not enough to go back for..."}
{"text":"When I travel to Phoenix for work I always make it a Point to allow enough time to get to Sir Veza's Taco Garage. This Place is Soooo Good I've even take Taco's Home on occasion. Honestly I found it hard to believe that this Place was only rated at 3 Stars? After reading some of the Reviews It was Clear that These People just don't know what to Order and Apparently have not ever eaten at a Airport and did not know that  Food is Expensive. I love the Design of the place and always enjoy drinking some of the local Craft beer available here. Also the service is always on Point! Thanks Guys, see you next week."}
{"text":"We ordered that carne asada burrito and grilled chicken bowl. The burrito was okay for airport fare although it would absolutely be a crime to purchase for $12 at an actual restaurant outside the airport. Their salsa come in sealed caps like taco bell and taco bell is definitely a better food place compared to this. The chicken bowl is the most repulsive thing I've put in my mouth as far as I can remember. It literally looks and taste like my puke after a long night of binge drinking."}
{"text":"Great service. I had a carne asada bowl and a margarita (forgot name). A must order. Got my food in less then 10 minutes after ordering. Again great fresh food and fairly inexpensive. If you're in chandler this place is a must."}
{"text":"Best veggie tacos I've had in a long time and Chuck was the best bar tender. I told him I liked a less sweet sangria and he replaced my sangria with a larger less sweet glass. The service was great and personal.  The open air was great paired with the mist! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre at best. Service was ridiculous. Worst guacamole I ever had. The only good thing was the mango margarita."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish tacos - should call it fish nugget.  For $9 - I got two bites of fish across two tacos.   Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Airport Food - Always a challenge, and the Phoenix Airport Terminal 4 has so many choices. I usually have an hour layover between flights at this American Hub. It is good for me as I can get in a couple of miles walk and if timing is right, even a lunch. I had a couple of chicken tacos.  Simple enough. Very nice. They grilled the onions, peppers and chicken, ha a small cup of black beans and rice, and a spicy salsa. The tacos each had two tortillas, so I halved things and ended up with four tacos and they were all wonderful. This is my new go to place in the Phoenix Sky Harbor in Terminal 4 .
Thank you Sir Veza"}
{"text":"Location: it is located in the Chandler mall. It has outdoor and indoor seatings close to the main food court. General areas are relatively clean and organized. However, this restaurant is more family oriented and I probably will not recommend it for a date night. 

Service: it is 120% excellence. The owner basically greed us at the door while we were reviewing the menu. The waitress is super friendly and attentive. After we were seated, the owner still comes back to check up on us from time to time. 

Food: we ordered shrimp ceviche as an appetizer. They put too much lime on it and it was a bit too soar. For main entree, I ordered the Soroman hotdog and it was absolutely delicious. The owner told me he moved out here from Tuson and I'm glad that they bought my favorite hotdog down here with him. I wanted to order the churrios for dessert but I was completely full at that point. 

Rating: I gave it a 3 stars because (1) the comment about the appetizer and (2) their menus are a bit pricy. I might come back here again to get the hotdog. Overall, I think this restaurant is average."}
{"text":"Awful! This is a $12 Asada bowl. About 75% beans. Even at the airport, I'd expect better. Better off at the grab n go..."}
{"text":"I tried this place a couple weeks ago. The bartenders and servers here Are attentive and I was treated like family the first time I came in. The food is good atmosphere is great and friendly staff. I will be a regular glad it's in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This was closest to my gate..and i was feeling hungry..so why not..

I got the overpriced 2 carnitas tacos... Not legit at all..

It was just eh....."}
{"text":"This place was awful. Someone dumped a drink on me because they were wasted and this place continued to serve them. Because she's a woman. This place is sexist. I complained to manager which ignored me. I would never recommend this place."}
