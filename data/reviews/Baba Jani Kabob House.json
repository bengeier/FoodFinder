{"text":"Came here yesterday, and really enjoyed the food. I got the beef fillet, which came with rice and a salad. Everything was delicious. The meat was tender and flavourful. Prices reasonable. My mom ordered a fish entree, and they gave her a soup on the house to try - delicious! I don't know what it was, but they only have a couple of soups. It had noodles, beans and chickpeas in it. The flavour was unlike anything I have tried before. The meals were large, much too large to finish in one sitting. I took the rest of mine to go, ate some for lunch and still haven't finished it. Even though this place is in the heart of downtown Richmond Hill, it has a plaza that you can conveniently park in."}
{"text":"We bought take outs. The owner is nice and the food tasted good. Salads were fresh. We bought a chicken and beef dish. Food is not spicy for our level. The flavour of kebabs are good and the meat was fresh and tender."}
{"text":"Best Persian food in Richmond Hill! The owner is a sweetheart! The food is a bit expensive but worth it!! They have delicious everything! I have nothing bad to say!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife were driving by and decided to stop in for a quick bite, turns out this place was absolutely delicious, a great find with great quality food and friendly staff. I definately recomend this place. There is also a lunch buffet which I will check out next time."}

This is a takeout review! 

The meat (beef kebabs and pieces of chicken) was sooo flavourful. Not spicy either, woohoo! 

The rice from here was also INCREDIBLY soft. Seriously, the softest, most tender rice I've ever had in my life. This still holds true as I eat two day old microwaved leftovers.

Loved that their (gigantic) naan came straight out of a tandoor (?). Too bad it turns brittle the next day.

My only complaint about the experience is the fact that they charge you for trays... Yes. $2 to put your meat in an aluminum tray. $1 for the rice. C'mon guys."}
