{"text":"based on some reviews i've read and heard in person I decided to try this place this past friday evening.  I had the prime rib large cut and my mom had the Philly cheese steak.  The prime rib was a decent size (not what I would call King cut) very salty and my mom's cheese steak was served on what appeared to be a large hot dog bun which totally fell apart while she was eating the steak appeared to be flank steak which you DON\"T use in a cheese steak...received 3 dinner rolls that were wet (almost soggy) on the bottom and we basic restaurant dinner rolls nothing exciting...especially with a bakery on site I guess I was expecting more  Atmosphere is very fire hall like if anyone reading this as ever been to a local firehall on the east coast  Service was decent, never did get a refill on my soda, the dessert of the day was cake which tasted like it had been sitting out for awhile.  After dinner I went over to the meat counter  they close at 6pm and I checked my cell phone it was 5:42 all the workers were busy pulling meat from the counter and not one person asked if they could help me.  Needless to say I was underwhelmed by this place.  Its definately more a senor hangout"}
{"text":"We moved here in April from Chicago and have gone to different delis and meat shops looking for fresh good steaks and hot Italian sausage. This place is it, which we pretty much knew when we pulled in the parking lot today and we were the only Arizona plates - all other cars were snowbirds.  At any rate, we got the hot Italian sausage to grill for dinner and it was HOT - which is what we want because that's what we are used to. Also, they actually have real Italian hot giardiniera which you can't find anywhere. Can't wait to make the steaks tomorrow night.  Also, the staff were helpful, friendly, and had a great sense of humor (that goes with the plastic pig you squeeze at the counter but find that out yourselves!)."}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant only.  Oh...where to start?  My husband and I went out to dinner with some friends and ended up here.  I wanted to like this place, I really did.  I loved that it was connected to a butcher shop and expected the same high quality meats that the butcher shop reviews raved about.  I was charmed that the menu included a long list of daily specials that seemed extremely reasonably priced for the amount of food offered. We were seated promptly and our waitress was fantastic.  She was attentive and very friendly. Everyone placed their orders and the salads were brought out extremely quickly...and that's when trouble started. Unknown at the time, my husband bit into something hard.  He was too scared to look, so he just swallowed.  Probably not the best idea but hey, that's what he did.  Our meals came out about 20 minutes later. I had the NY strip with a baked potato and my husband and guest both ordered the prime rib with a baked potato.  Everyone also received mixed vegetables that were somewhat cold and fairly bland.  The baked potatoes tasted like they had been in the oven all day, dry on the outside with chewy skins.  There was something that looked like a cooked root (at least that's what I'm hoping for) in the foil wrapper of my husbands.  It looked like a dark rope and was pretty tough to pull apart.  Either way it was kind of concerning. When I wasn't chewing on gristle, my NY strip tasted fantastic and was very tender at times. Eventually the gristle won over and I ate maybe 1/4 of the steak in total. The prime ribs were some of the worst cuts we've seen.  My husband ate only about 1/2 of it.  The most shocking part was when both he and our guest opened up what appeared to be their containers of horseradish and instead found moldy cheese shreds.  These weren't sitting out just for an extra day.  These were 1/2 covered with green mold on the top and bottom.  Our waitress apologized profusely and took them away immediately, bringing out the sides of horseradish instead.  I don't blame her at all, but someone in the back was definitely slacking on the job. Peach cobbler was dessert and it was sub-par.  Again though, my poor husband bit into something hard.  This time he elected to spit it out and found a piece of peach pit. Overall it was sorely disappointing.  Maybe one of these days I'll be back to try the butcher shop section of this place but as far as the restaurant is concerned...absolutely not."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best restaurants if you like home cooked meals fast friendly service!! I recommend the prime rib :)"}
{"text":"The stuffed burgers they sell, awesome. Frozen cheese curds are also available here, oh yes."}
{"text":"This place is great for both 2 leggers (homo-sapiens) and 4 leggers (dogs)! I love going to the butcher and getting exactly what you want instead of digging through packaged meat trying to find the right piece. Their porterhouse steaks are divine, and they will even give you a \"women's\" cut for the petite eater. They also have leg bones for the little ones. They happened to be out and they cut a dozen bones to the dimensions I wanted. Please make sure your little one eats them outside because they do get bloody and gross. Also throw them away after they finish or they do attract ants. Obviously I have learned the hard way:( I cannot tell you how happy I have been with their steaks and yes they do cost a little bit more but the are so worth the price!!! The store reminds me of going to the butcher downtown Chicago as a child with my Mom. The place is full of older folks who do value a good piece of meat. Yummers!!!"}
{"text":"I am a busy working mom that tries to eat healthy as much as I can and I was received a gift certificate for Midwestern Meats.  I ordered their pre-packaged meals from their website and had them delivered today - I just ate the orange roughy, pico and sweet potato for dinner and it was delish!  Super healthy and took me 2 minutes to heat up and eat.  I also ordered their steak, chicken and salmon meals and I can't wait to try them.  It's so nice to have a fresh, \"clean eating\" meal that is already pre-measured and ready to eat.  Perfect to take to work for lunch.  I am a fan!"}
{"text":"I really wish this place was closer to phx but when we can we will make the drive out there to shop. They do offer delivery service which is very helpful. the butcher shop is great. reminds me of the typical midwestern butchershop.  they also have a freezer section that has some jewels in it. one thing my wife loves is they have real midwest style cheese curds. the breaded ones.  not very healthy but a great treat.    before i wrote my review i figured i would read some others and there seemed to be some comments about bad customer service. I only make it out there once every few months but every time we have been (bakery and butcher shop) we have had nothing but great service.  the only bad experience ive had there was not their fault but of another customer who was just rude.   their prices are really good for quality meats."}
{"text":"whomever processed my meat order knew it was bad quality and served it anyway. complaint to owner got a reply full of excuses.  followed website instructions for online ordering and paid with paypal. site said to expect text within 48 hours to pick it up. did not get text, called and left message but no reply. sent text complaining order not ready and after being questioned who i was i was told to pick up tomorrow (72hrs.) should have inspected before leaving because the ordered 12lbs lean ground beef  was frozen, dry and colorless, smelled like the inside of a walk-in cooler and was tasteless after prep. a week later i wanted a slice of cake and went to bakery but they had two pies and two kinds of brownies and that was it. \"that's all we have left\" staff said.  I sent owner a message of complaint and this is his response:  \"your complaint is noted. I will happily refund you tomorrow. You ordered on Monday afternoon, and could have walked in the next day to pick up your order. I apologized for my day late missing your order, small business , sometimes I have to help in other areas, thinking 12 lbs of hamburger isn't an emergency. We close at 6pm on Saturday and aren't open Sunday, and the best thing about a bakery is when you sell out. I know you have better theories and could do a better job then I do, but I am not interested in a consultation from you. We've been doing this imperfectly for 24 years and I will do it the best I can for many more. You are probably a better manager then me but that won't do me much good will it. I understand when a customer decides that we are not good enough for them, I'm just lucky enough that my loyal customers tell me face to face their concerns, so I fix them and make sure they get what they pay for. Again, I will refund you tomorrow and will continue to try to provide an opportunity for my family by running this small business that is sometimes imperfect, knowing most of my customers understand that I have a great product, great philosophies, and work my butt off to try to make everyone happy. 24 years! \""}
{"text":"I've only ordered bakery goods so far but they have been great,  we ordered 2 piecakes last time and they were awesome.  It's a pie baked into the middle of a cake.  I got them for a graduation party and they were a huge hit.  I placed my order through the website and they were very quick to respond and stay in touch.  When I went into pick them up they also had some dog treats that I snatched up too.  Over all the experience was great, well worth the 20 minute drive from our house. Thanks again for the service and food"}
{"text":"Service was prompt and attentive. The Orange salmon was a small portion and the sauce could have been a orange jelly. Peas and carrots vegetable side was mushy looked and tasted overcooked. The peach pie was fair. A bit overpriced for the quality and portion size. Overall meal taste could have been better. Best part of the meal was the roll with honey butter."}
{"text":"A nice, convenient restaurant with down home cooking.  Generous portions  and hot, tasty food.  We will be back next year.  Yup, we are THOSE snowbirds that are so often referred to in reviews.  We get the feeling we aren't well liked by so many, but just the opposite too by others.  We love coming to Mesa for the winter and with places like this to eat we enjoy our time and fellowship with others.  This is a nice place and refreshingly different than the franchise restaurants.   The grilled chicken came with salad, potato, hot vegetable (carrots) and dessert!!  And the price was reasonable at less than $10.    Fast, friendly service.  We browsed the bakery and meat market and will definitely try steaks and bakery items in the future.     Thank you, too to our server who brought the extra dessert to our table.  Very kind of you!!"}
{"text":"Went here with the girlfriend's grandparents last week and I must say I expected better after all the hype I got. Of course some of the hype was actually incorrect (THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY SERVE ND POTATOES) so they get cut a little slack for that. The service is fast and friendly, the bakery has some tasty stuff in it, and if you ever want to buy a cow's heart this is the place to do it (don't know why you would though).   As far as the food, that's where I was underwhelmed. The mashed potatoes were like water, the veggies were cold, and the steak was just alright. I asked for my steak rare and I got medium well. Not being an ass I decided not to send it back and the steak itself wasn't bad. Just not too memorable....  Combined with the facts that the parking sucks and it sounds like an airport terminal inside I don't think I will be back. Unless maybe if I ever find a need for a whole cow's heart"}
{"text":"Was In the area and found it on yelp ..liked the picture of the stuffed burger so ordered 2 to go  and went over the the butcher side and bought allot of wonderful stuff, pot pie and steaks, loved it..!! as i went through the bakery to pick up my burgers bought some sweets ...yum... Not so Impressed with the burgers ..Wanted to get back to the butcher so I took a friend for lunch and It was confirmed the restaurant sucks....:( sorry the rolls hard my friend \"steak\" awful they told us the NY strip was thicker ..??!?!? I cant see how It was soo thin...my Philly  had hard bun the meat was to thick and awful ..But I will continue to shop at the meat market  always looking for good quality meat and they do  ..Something goes very wrong with the meat on it way to the resturant ..!?!? Maybe a new COOK oh and the stringbeans with tomato side from a can disgusting ....SORRY ..!!!?!"}
{"text":"After a few friends and Google had reccomended them for a great steak I decided to stop in, and I was thoroughly impressed! I come from a family of old-fashion butchers & meat cutters and worked in our family meat market in Cleveland,  OH till it closed in 2000 because of big grocery chains. So when their shop's name came up and I saw it was a small business and just like my family's,  I had to give it a shot. I was greeted and helped by Dustin(this man deserves a raise!), who was one of the most helpful employees I've encountered anywhere Not to mention he was genuine friendly and smiling the whole time, and in my opinion that's just as important, if not more, than just being helpful. He answered all my questions, gave me some reccomendations on where to find other stuff they didn't carry, and even gave me the info for a wild game shop that they didn't carry. This gentlemen was the embodiment of true customer service and knows exactely how to keep customers coming back! I also stopped and picked up some amazing looking baked good from the attached bakery. Thank you MW Meats & Dustin... I will make sure to refer all my friends/family who live around here and will be back everytime I'm in town!   -MRL"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I used to be regular customers of Midwestern Meat Market, going at least once a week.  We could always count on a good-tasting and tender steak for a very reasonable price.  Health issues intervened and we didn't go there for a few years.  I began going a few months ago and was most disappointed.  The New York steak was so tough, it could barely be cut.  The server suggested a rib-eye in it's place.  It was also tough, with a lot of connective tissue.  Only about 1/4th of the steak was edible.  Next time, I tried the prime rib.  What once was about the best around was flavorless and on the tough side.  My third return trip, I ordered the pork ribs.  They were out.  New York steak, out.  Rib eye again, and the same as before, stringy, chewy, and too much fat.  I give up on this place."}
{"text":"The meat selection is excellent and always looks fresh. The restaurant side has a lot of great selections to pick from I've had lunch there several times and it has always been good and so has the service. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Dishonest business practices.  Employees would not honor prices on their own website during Memorial day weekend.  I used to be a fairly regular customer of this business until this memorial day weekend.  The prices were gouged over the weekend on their \"Own baby back ribs\" which I had bought 10 slabs of for two events previously in the last 6 weeks.  The price was more than doubled for memorial day weekend, and even when the website showed a considerably cheaper price, the staff refused to honor the advertised price.  I've usually spent between 500 and 1200 dollars per year at this butcher shop between buying their quarter cows, or for when I through large events."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. Ordered a omelet  and the waitress asked how do you want your eggs. I said I ordered a omelet, why would you ask how I want my eggs. I want a omelet. My son ordered biscuits and gravy. I ended up with sunny side up eggs over sausage, mushroom, potatoes and green peppers. No mention of green peppers on the menu. The gravy from the biscuits and gravy was wall paper paste. Will never be back would rather eat sand"}
{"text":"Call for hours. The restaurant is usually open. The attached meat shop & bakery is business hours. Hometown food with home cooking, reasonable prices. This is a local gem. During the winter, this place is packed and hard to get into. During summer months it's amazing the ease of getting a table. Consistent home cooking with good service, that treat you like a regular. The meats are fresh from the meat shop everything is pretty local including the hot sauces.  The bakery next door has amazing cupcakes and they make phenomenal cakes to order as well. Plus you can get ice cream treat too."}
{"text":"Both. Meals hubby and i ordered was awful sausage was not cooked through. I did not get proper order again saus not cooked it was gressy and cold waitress not helpful"}
{"text":"God Bless America!  Finally found us a genuine Iowa Pork Tenderloin sandwich in Mesa, AZ!!!!  Memories of my hometown - Holstein, Iowa"}
{"text":"We have been buying their meats since they opened. NEVER disappointed, always great.... Bakery is good too..... The restaurant is good but it is a typical mid-west style cafe/diner restaurant. It was never meant to compete with Ruth's Chris or Morton's. But it is a good restaurant with average to good service and good to great food. Never disappointed here."}
{"text":"This is our standard goto place for lunch or dinner. I'm trying to think if we've ever eaten anywhere in Mesa but here. :-). I often end up with the prime rib special. Hard to beat tasty prime rib and a pie for the prices here.   Apparently you can buy a steak from the butcher and they'll grill it for you. I'm going to try that one day.  Service could be a tad better."}
{"text":"This was my first time here  I had the Sirloin  steak 8oz  with a salad  and  baked potato and something that look like green beans tomatoes and bacon the salad was good baked  potato was good and it was bigger than my steak the green beans were over cooked and look like they were out of a can and my steak was not that good ether was thought  having there Owen butcher shop next door you think the meat would be better  now for the  The bakery shop staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about their products ended up getting a raspberry bar and a blueberry bar and they were excellent"}
{"text":"I ordered a crown roast a week in advance of Christmas. I went to pick it up late afternoon on Christmas Eve. I was informed that they didn't have it. I had promised my Christmas guests crown roast. I understand things go wrong. But to not have the professional courtesy to call and tell me so I have time for Plan B is unforgiveable. I've probably spent a few hundred dollars there previously this year. They can kiss this business goodbye."}
{"text":"Delish food, not so great sevice. Waitress brought the wrong drink to my lunch date and NO ONE who worked there knew what was in the chicken salad. More than likely will not return (even though my french dip was VERY tasty)"}
{"text":"Restaurant, Bakery and Meat Shop. Affordable streaks, prime rib, salmon, and sandwiches. Meals come with rolls, vegetables, and choice of potatoes.  Did not care for canned green beans."}
{"text":"The cuts of meat that they have on offer here is incredible. You want it? They got it. It's difficult looking for an authentic butcher nowadays. Luckily Midwestern Meats is here for the assistance. The only thing I can truly criticize them on was their service. When I went in to ask for assistance, some of the staff were more neutral rather than friendly. With that being said, the cashier was a fantastic person to deal with. (I wish I could remember his name) I will definitely come back here if I need something specific."}
{"text":"I left this place mostly confused and also just plain disappointed. The food is very bland and not what you would expect for a place that has a good meat counter. I was shocked at how bad the food was. The pancakes were perhaps among the worst pancakes I've ever had they were tough and lacked flavor. The biscuits and gravy made me just sad... The biscuit was small and covered in gravy that was similar to paste and had a strange taste that all the salt and pepper I could muster couldn't help. I also thought it was strange that for $8.99 you get only one biscuit that is in my opinion small, egg, and bacon. For that same price you would expect a larger fluffy biscuit or two decent sized biscuits especially with them having an on site bakery. The staff is friendly enough so I don't fault the polite waitress for these issues. This place should be a place that is legendary for having a great breakfast since it has an in house meat market and bakery. This place should be up there with Matt's and Hen House Cafe but finds itself being something that should be much more."}
{"text":"Great meat market and bakery! The staff is friendly and extremely helpful! Have had their steaks, sausage and love their cole slaw and potato salad!  Don't leave without getting something yummy from the bakery - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a bun-less burger for lunch. Meat was tasty. Coleslaw and salad were fresh. Bakery had some beautiful pastries, cakes, pies and breads. Service was average; tried to joke and converse with our server, but she was all business. Probably won't go back as I don't typically eat beef, sweets, carbs or unhealthy fats. More my dad's kind of place."}
{"text":"Regarding the restaurant: food was fine, waitress (supervisor) was rude, unprofessional and provided awful service.  Very disappointing because it used to be our favorite place, we recommended it a lot. Based of our recent visit, I'm in no hurry to go back. What used to be five stars in food and service has now average food and lousy service."}
{"text":"What a great find and not just because I'm from the midwest. They are very friendly and helpful. The bakery is awesome and you can get 2 scoopes of icecream for 50¢! Their prices on steaks and just about everything else are better than most of the other places we go. We bought several things and only spent $50..........I have let a week go by since our visit because I wanted to try a few of the things we bought before I finished my review.  The beefs cube steaks were tender and delicious.  The jalapeno and cheddar brats we bought were great.  You could actually taste the jalapeno and the cheddar.  We used the ground beef to make a meatloaf and it was perfect.  Not to much fat, but enough to flavor the meat.  We also bought some of their beef sticks, which we ate on the way home.  I have to say that they were not my favorite.  The hot was not hot at all and the regular seemed a little greasy and hard.  The 7-layer bars my gf bought were very good.  I am not a sweets person so they were mind-numbingly sweet to me, but my gf said that that is the way they are suppose to be.  We will definately go back and this time get some steaks and because there is a diner there, we will probably eat too."}
{"text":"Butcher shop is the bomb.  Great selection, a little overpriced, but not that overboard."}
{"text":"Flashback to 1970....and not in a good way. I came in for a slice of pecan pie and was told I could only get a slice in the restaurant and that I had to order a whole small or large pie. The pies were sitting on top of the bakery case very close to where customers heads are and a guy even handed someone his money by reaching over the pies. Between that and who knows how many sneezes tainted those pies, I wasn't ordering one. And again, I only wanted one piece. Some of the bakery items looked decent. Because I was craving pecans, I got the baklava and pecan baklava. The pecan one was dry and the other one was average. The place smells like a meat packing plant, which is not very desirable when you're ordering desserts. I cruised by the meats on my way out and they were sooooooo overpriced and didn't look any better than meat from Frys."}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant . .. Very Poor Service. After we ordered  it took 52 minutes for our food to come.. I had a call when the server was taking the order I checked the time cuz we came with kids who dint wanna wait anymore . .. Food was average. Although  the diablo  burger patty was good by itself  the burger did lacked the flavor .. We were not asked if we needed anything  else until we were dun. I had to drink water from my son's bottle  water"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy this place. But went in tonight for their prime rib special. Worst prime rib I've ever had. I ordered a king cut medium. Was first brought a regular cut rare, then brought a regular cut that was medium well. Finally was brought a king cut medium rare. Finally just took it even though it wasn't what I ordered. Then the meat was not good. Mostly fat, lots of sinew, veins. Etc. I would avoid prime rib if you come here."}
{"text":"First thing I  tried here were their frozen burgers patties, brought them  home for some grilling and chillin.   Verdict === INSANE BURGERS==== Highest quality beef flavor ever!!EVER!!   Who would imagine these unsuspecting frozen typical looking patties would house such delicious flavor? Don't imagine but go and experience it for yourself.  Nothing but rave reviews by everybody we've had over for our meals.    This place is worth driving out of your way to stock up on your grilled goods & food Network showdowns.  If you have that 2nd freezer, stuff it. You will be the  talk of  the town.      .  I've  ordered our Thanksgiving Turkey here too. Again, EXCELLENT.   Delicious wide assortment of baked goods and adjacent restaurant which is down home and friendly with delicious sandwiches and family food.  Shoot, Meat markets and local butchers are rare. (sorry for all the puns ) Enjoy and support them while they are still around."}
{"text":"Fantastic grass fed sirloin made for a killer dinner for us."}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast was always a tradition for us before we left PA.  There were so many little independent diners to choose from. When we relo'd to AZ, we decided to continue the tradition.  We drove by this place several times during the week and saw the guy directing traffic in the parking lot so curiosity got the better of this cat - I had to check it out. So one Sunday we headed up for brunch. It was close to noon and I think we got the last table in the house but that is not always a sign of a good place in this area. Heck, despite the economy, it seems every place is packed all the time in Phoenix!  Immediately we ordered and got three cups of coffee. At 99c a cup, the expectations were fairly low as I can't honestly say that we found much restaurant coffee out here to be great. Mostly it is so stiff that the spoon doesn't just stand up, it salutes. Anyway, the steaming brew comes and it is amazingly good!  Smooth.  Not too strong, not to watery. Goldilocks would say it was just right. And the refills kept coming.   DS and I both ordered the Pancake sandwich - 2 eggs with 2 cakes and meat.  Nothing fancy. But the eggs were cooked perfectly and the cakes were large and hot and tender. To me there is nothing worse than a restaurant that serves a rubbery pancake or one that served as a doorstop in a prior life. These were just good pancakes.  Freshly made.  DH ordered a chorizo skillet that was a wonderfully overstuffed skillet of Chorizo, peppers, and cheese topped with eggs and a side of their home fries. The plate was loaded with tasty sausage and just the right amount of peppers. Maybe a little more cheese than it needed but still tasty.  And real home fries. Not the typical frozen cubes of potatoes.   If you are looking for fresh quality at a reasonable price, make this a place to try soon!  We will be trying lunch and dinner soon and will update the review then!"}
{"text":"I love the butcher shop.  The selection of meats is great.  The employees have gone out of their way to help me find what I was looking for.  They have delicious (and giant) stuffed burgers under $4 in the freezer section.  The restaurant is just ok.  I've eaten there maybe twice and wasn't impressed with the food.  I wouldn't eat there again.  The bakery has a good selection of pastries.  I love their cream puffs! Scoops of ice cream is cheap too, which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Great place, great meats - grassfed, no added steroids or antibiotics.  Great service.  Theu also have a bakery.  We love to buy meats from a butcher!"}
{"text":"I ordered 15 NY Steaks 12-16 oz in size.  Each steak was perfectly marbled and no chewy sections of tendon.  When a steak is perfectly marbled, all that is further needed is salt and pepper for grilling.  The end product tasted like Buttah!  My order was professionally packaged"}
{"text":"What I go here for are their sausages, polish, brat, etc. I've never eaten at this place but it gets consistently mediocre reviews for the restaurant. As far as the butcher shop goes, it's above average. The service and selection has always been fine for me. Parking can get scarce.  On the down side, it is well established that cows are designed to eat grass, not corn. Their sign out along the street proudly boasts corn fed meats. But these are the most unhealthy for you, white fats, higher in cholesterol, etc. If you want better tasting and healthier meats always buy grass fed beef. It's what cows were designed to eat, not corn in huge muddy unhealthy factory feed lots. Corn fed beef is what places like McDonalds uses.  I still like their sausages. But I never buy steak or ground beef here."}
{"text":"Just left this place, AMAZING customer service.  The two gentleman working at the meat counter were extremely helpful and knowledgable.   I'm cooking ribs for the first time and they had a ton of helpful tips on different ways to prepare and cook them.  They offered to cut them up and also took out the membrane for me.  Love this place, love the quality of the meat, but most of all I love the customer service at this place."}
{"text":"The restaurant is definitely home style cooking,  Service is aways friendly and pricing is so low.    Laurie an I just had turkey dinner (each had one) that came with dessert and the bill was less than $15."}
{"text":"Coming to Az from Iowa, I was so disappointed in the quality of meats that the grocery stores and places like Costco sell. This market sells great quality meats and products and I will be making the trek to Mesa on a regular basis...had a great breakfast on a Saturday morning as well. This markets meats are second to none in Arizona and is as good as any I have ever purchased anywhere! CORN FED!!!"}
{"text":"Imagine you seasoned a big roast and cooked it in your oven for hours, cooled it down, and then sliced it. This is the roast beef from Midwestern Meats. No joke- I have not once purchased roast beef from a grocery or deli since I tasted Midwestern's. I was in Mesa today, and couldn't help but swing by.  The place is divided into three areas: a butcher shop, a bakery, and a restaurant. The restaurant is VERY inexpensive and serves the Midwestern comfort food fare you might imagine, in a very homespun environment. The bakery is hit or miss for me, but I absolutely love their coconut cream pies. They have breads, pastries, cookies, cupcakes, coffee cakes, pies, ice cream, etc. The butcher shop has really good meat they ship in from Iowa. Chops and steaks, cut right in front of you, to your specification, plus ground meats, sausages, fresh gourmet burgers, ready for your grill- you name it, they probably have it.  I picked up some pork chops today and they were beautiful- super fresh, hand trimmed, and cut just as I asked for my next State Fair cooking contest.  Everyone who works here is ridiculously -and honestly- nice. For those transplants from the Midwest who miss its particular charms, this is your Mecca."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with two other couples. I had the special for the night, NY Strip steak . It was cooked perfectly and the flavor was excellent. I had soup with my meal and was very good. Sarah had a nice salad with her meal. Two people had the cod and it was good too. We had one person get salmon and another got the rib eye. All said their food was good too. If you get one of their special a dessert came with your meal. Service was good and friendly. We will be back"}
{"text":"This butcher shop is so wonderful. Prime rib for Christmas dinner was fabulous and the restaurant next door was great. Prices are decent for what you get and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and got something out if each section of the place. The butchers and men in the meat market went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. The ground chuck and pickles we bought were delicious. The lady behind the donut counter also was above and beyond. She gave us a special for a dozen donuts for $4....a bargain. All of the donuts are hands down the freshest donuts we have ever tasted. Also highly recommend the pumpkin bar! Next was dinner at the restaurant. The hostess was terrible. Not inviting whatsoever. The food itself was very sub par..nothing special. The waitress however was nice. When we were done, we went to the hostess to pay our bill and she ignored us for a solid 5 minuted by aimlessly wandering around the restaurant instead if helping us. Finally a waitress had to tell her to come take care of our check. When she did, she did not say anything other than \"your total is...\". We paid with a gift card and told her to leave a tip on it for the waitress. She said she couldnt and when we told her thats unfortunate since we didn't bring our wallets, only the gift card, she said \"well i dont make the rules\". Overall, an okay place...nothing special, with a terrible hostess that really brought down the place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my meal there yesterday with our friends and family !!! I ordered one of their specials for the day a Prime Rib Sandwich with great expectations of getting a wonderful piece of meat seeing the meat shop was right next door . What I got was what we call in the mid west a \"beef commercial\" . It was nothing more than a piece of bread with a slice of meat and covered with gravy ,mashed potatoes and creamed corn with a dinner roll . The part that really upset me was when I tried to cut the meat and it was  a bunch of gristle and veins which was covered with gravy that I couldn't cut through with my knife . Don't get me wrong ,not all of the meat was gristle ,but when I cut into the first piece and found the gristle it really turned my stomach !!! That whole end of the piece of meat should of been cut off in the kitchen instead of put on my plate and covered up with gravy !!!"}
{"text":"I was craving donuts, and decided to stop in for a couple. The woman helping me seemed miserable. I ordered one chocolate frosted, and one vanilla frosted. They were both put in a bag on their side without any paper which caused most of the icing to come off onto the bag. The donuts are delicious, but they lack customer service."}
{"text":"This is the steakhouse of my choice in the area. It is also a functional butcher and allows you to choose a cut from the butcher and they will grill it up at your choosing. This service is why I choose Midwestern Meats. Their butcher selection is better than their menu selection and always leaves me feeling pampered"}
{"text":"It's not even a splurge and I don't think that anything comes close to this restaurant and that's true .the meat is undescribable it literally is so good that you want just let it melt in your mouth. Did I say melt yeah the meat is that good any cut you get the bakery is on grill you wouldn't believe it but she can buy me some the other night that everything is right there and we're talking Italian pastry talking bread blueberry banana anything you can think of is over there and they are a very good price I think even with tears and my meal with the steak and you get great side dishes made to your liking I think I spent like $25 Tip of course . It is not a restaurant atmosphere . The butcher their meat right there for you to your size that you like and how you want it cooked and I guarantee you any good you would not complain about it it's that good! You want to thank the Butcher and the chef there self then when you go over to that side but the bakery all my goodness enjoy I guarantee you won't regret it Debora Ison"}
{"text":"Hit and miss--sometimes great service, sometimes could use a little work on it but overall a pretty good place."}
{"text":"This place is great for buying meats but not so sure if I will be back for a while as I have no need for rude with my pound of meat.   I gave this place a really good review before because of the quality of meat they offer. I still stand by that review but have to say that my recent dealing with them left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). I understand requesting uncommon meat blends is a pain for them but it is their job to fill that request!   Do not want to feel like I am making someone's day harder than it needs to be just because I make a request that I have made many times in the past with no issue mind you. If not for the ability to place special orders than they would be pretty much the same as the chain supermarket meat sections. And nobody wants that!!  I guess you can call this a re-update I spoke to someone when I went in to place a new order and she was super nice. I had no issue with placing my order this time and even got a few helpful hints. So it seems like most people at least care about what they are doing here."}
{"text":"Wow, I've been driving past this place for years. Can't leave I haven't tried this place sooner. I went there for breakfast this morning and haft the amazing top-sirloin special only $6.99. It came with two eggs, an biscuit, and choice of hash browns or country potatoes. The staff is friendly and we got a few desserts from the bakery to go. Definitely returning for the lunch or dinner menu and to check out the meat department."}
{"text":"Who knew there was a restaurant there? I've always heard of Midwestern Meats for local protien but not the restaurant! We were on our way to another restaurant for breakfast and decided to stop in there instead. WOW...so glad we did!   The breakfast skillets are amazing and VERY large. Good for a couple of meals, actually! Nice, big pancakes and coffee was pretty good. They responded to my 4 yr old's requests without a blink of an eye as well.   The cashier could have been a bit more friendly, thus the 4 stars. All in all we LOVED it, our cute, little, friendly waitress and the food. Not your typical diner or national chain.   This is our new 'go-to' breakfast place for out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Seems like people who use the butcher shop rave about the place.    Perhaps there is a disconnect between the level of quality on the butcher shop side and the restaurant side.  One of the more difficult to eat cuts of Prime Rib I've had in a while.    For a place that is supposed to specialize in meats, I guess you'd expect more."}
{"text":"wife and I went sunday for breakfast, Not that i have ever been to iowa but this place feels like right out of the corn fields the interior is what i would call early american country,the staff is very nice,i ordered the creole scramble I asked about the creole sauce that goes on the dish all she said was that it was good,and asked me how i would like my eggs(i thought it was a scramle) it turned out to taste very much like marinara sauce when i recived the dish i removed the glob of cheese looking for my eggs which i ordered poach...........hmmm no eggs i called the waitress over and asked ,she promply went to the kitchen and retrived them My wife had a couple of eggs and 2 bacon which was burnt at one end and not cooked at the other..........how do you do that........my dish wasnt to bad but i am not a fan of marinara/creole sauce with breakfast"}
{"text":"The restaurant section is awful. The wait was horrendous and you end up getting sat at a table meant for 8 when there is just two of you! The food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor. Once the food was delivered the server was never to be found. I only gave two stars because I enjoy the meat section and the vast choices the offer back there."}
{"text":"Midwestern Meats has the best meat I have ever had. It is fresh, tender and delicious. The meat is hormone free and corn fed. They have an amazing \"from scratch\" bakery that can make anything you desire. The restaurant has some of the best \"homemade\" food I have ever had in my life. It is very reasonably priced (cheap actually). They even have buy one get one free dinners. I love this place"}
{"text":"Such delicious and high-quality meat.  In order of importance:  First, always first: Bacon.   Next, we love the pre-formed and frozen Hamburger Patties (the only hamburgers we will grill).  They also have the filled (with cheese or other deliciousness) patties for you to buy- which are what they serve in their restaurant.  Think: your favorite savory goodness wrapped in a rotunda of mouth-watering-ground-beefness, put it on your grill, enjoy delicious flavor.   Thirdly we buy the chuck roast, which I cook in the crock pot or pressure cooker and is bizarrely tender and delicious.   D) Amazing steaks.  You'll be freaked out by grocery store steaks after you see how quickly these cook and how tender they are... these are natural and high quality, which makes me wonder what the crap they do to the meat at the grocery store to make it grocery store meats so nasty in comparison. 5. Chicken breast.  Huge.  Just... huge.  Dolly parton huge.  And way juicier than grocery store chicken.  Lastly:  Stew Meat which I use to make very tender beef stroganoff.  Or stew.    Prices same/comparable to any grocery store's regular meat prices.   They also have dog bones for you to buy for your Woofie-shaped friends."}
{"text":"Went for a mid week lunch and was seated and attended to right away. I've heard weekends can be very busy. Growing up in Iowa, I've had my share of Pork Tenderloin sandwiches (Millies, Smitty's,...). Today's was my favorite! Not a flat pounded loin but thicker with an amazing batter. The wafting aromas of the connected smoke house doesn't hurt the atmosphere either. Price/Value ratio is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best steakhouses I have been to. Great prices, fresh meats, good portions. This is my new steakhouse for sure! Best to go after 6pm to miss the seasoned citizens crowd. Next time I will try the stuffed burgers!"}
{"text":"Every once awhile you get nostalgic feelings for the pastoral simplicities of yester year.  For these moments there is Midwestern Meats.  You walk inside and you swear you have just entered a Norman Rockwell painting.  The decor, the patrons, the food....everything is middle America 1940's.    The food is standard \"corn fed\" fare.  Decent, not spectacular.  But that's not why I go.  This is the closest thing I've found to dinner at my grandparents.  Every once in awhile it is nice to wrap yourself up in a bit of nostalgia.  This place has it."}
{"text":"No No No! The food is better in the Army, County Hospital or Jail. Canned veggies that had been on the warmer all day.  The Boot leather they call Steak?! I wouldn't even serve this to the prisoners in Iraq. Even starving children in Ethiopia will turn this  down."}
{"text":"Best Burgers in AZ...hands down...I have been to this place twice. And this is about the closest thing you can get to a small town restaurant in a big city.  The service is excellent the food is great and fresh and the prices are cheap.  They have this burger that they stuff with ingredients..like jalapeno's and cheese or whatever you want, the beef is fresh from the chophouse right next door...which is also right next to their bakery. 99 cent pie all day every day.  This place is great I definitely recommend going here if your a carnivore."}
{"text":"This place is 3 stores in one, a restaurant, a bakery and a meat market.  I would give the restaurant 2.5 stars, the bakery 4 stars and meat market 5+stars.  I've only eaten at the restaurant once; my Mom and her husband love this place - so on her recommendation a couple friends and I went for a prime rib dinner.  My friends and I are not young, but we were the youngest people there.  No problem, it was 8pm and we were starving.  We each ordered the prime rib dinner which came with soup, potato and a dessert.  The soup was some sort of cream soup that was so gelatinous the spoon stood straight up in the sticky glop, yuck!  Thank God the prime rib was brought out quickly, it was FANTASTIC!  Medium rare, tender, tasty in it's own juice.  Delicious!  It's a good thing we weren't hungry for dessert, it was some sort of pudding that had the same gelatinous appearance as the soup earlier.  Gross.  I've only stopped through the bakery once for some cookies.  Everything is made fresh daily and they'll take special requests for anything including sugar free and low fat items.    Go here for the meat.  I won't even buy grocery store beef since shopping here.  They'll cut anything and everything to your preferences and needs.  They are so helpful and friendly and the best part is the quality of the beef.  Everything is well marbled, fresh and fresh cut and it tastes 100 times better than anything I've bought in a grocery store.  Prices are beyond reasonable especially considering the level of service they provide.    Between this place and the Superstition Ranch Market down the street, I rarely have to shop at a grocery store."}
{"text":"Homestyle cooking. Very reasonable prices. After your meal make sure you visit the bakery and butcher. You won't leave empty handed!"}
{"text":"I will never buy red meat from a grocery store again if I can help it. I was planning on going out for a steak diner and at the last minute decided to cook out myself. I looked online and found a produce market (check out the review for superstition ranch market) as well as this meat market. They are a block or so away from each other which was really convenient since I needed to stop at both. The staff is extremely friendly and more than happy to help with your meat selection. They will even cook you a piece so you can try it. The bakery is great as well... Pecans Pies are great!  Anyway, if you get out to east Mesa, check this place out.. it's great!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed !!  We were served canned vegetables, mediocre meat  & tasteless gravy.  Pie advertised as homemade - crust was tough - not even close to homemade.  Just not a great place to eat!  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place one last time after the last time when they took 30 minutes for us to place an order and were out of everything.  We went for the meatloaf and chicken and dumplings today, normal Thursday menu items. Waitress took over twenty minutes to wait on us. She did communicate she was working with a large party (over 6 people) and it would be a small wait. No problem. Finally got our order in and twenty minutes after it is in the kitchen she comes back and tells us they are out of meatloaf. Last time we were there every item I picked on the menu from root beer and Mr. Pibb to the normal main courses on the menu they were out of those items too. The problems that night were blamed on a fill-in cook. We also waited forever and another waitress took our order as we were about to leave. We ended up ordering the prime rib this night because everything else we ordered was not available. The prime rib was over done and tough and certainly didn't taste like the corn fed beef I was raised on in Wisconsin. I gave them another chance because I really believed it was a bad night last time but it seems every time we go the place just gets worse."}
{"text":"Never eaten in the restaurant and it seems to be surprisingly busy for the reviews. Although, the folks I tend to see in the restaurant likely don't use Yelp. On that note, I have dealt with the bakery staff and am pretty sure I know the bitter woman others have spoken of... she certainly does seem mad even when scooping ice cream.  I love their $.50 ice cream, it makes me feel like a kid again and I love that they generally only have a few options to choose from. I have tried their bars and some are better than others and mostly all of them are better than I could bake myself.   On to the meat market. Yes, I too have seen the corn fed beef sign. Yes, this has bothered me some as well since I am aware that cows really prefer to eat grass, just like chickens like to eat bugs and fruit and whatnot. However, I would not go as far to say that the meat here is comparable to choice/prime meat from Frys. Maybe as far as nutritional content (fat, blabla whatever), but flavor wise? I avoid getting meat from Frys these days, even the choice/prime stuff. With that said, I do feel that they have a decent selection of cuts to choose from and I do believe their prices are fair. Especially when I consider what I have spent buying meat other places. They do also offer packages which seem decent and remind me of a meat shoppe in south Scottsdale that I love and miss.   I am to the point that I will stop in just for the hot pepperoni sticks. Man they're so good! They remind me of being a kid and walking up to the corner store. I know they don't make them there but nonetheless way better than a Jacklink or Slimjim. The staff in the meat market are always very courteous and attentive. I have gone in looking for a certain cut and they have always known what I was talking about and given me alternatives if I have asked.  We went in pretty close to closing the other day and it was settling to know how well they clean their area. One gentleman had the slicer, table, whatever it's called, all broken down and was cleaning it well. See, it may be corn fed beef but to me, it has ruined the taste of beef from many other places for me.  The twice baked Diablo potatoes are good, their frozen brisket burgers are good, I am not a huge fan if pork but the butterflied chops were good, dude loves the ham salad and chicken salad. The beans weren't up my alley, a little too sweet and the kabobs are a little sweet for my liking as well.   We will keep coming here, who knows maybe one day they will offer grass fed beef and all of my wildest dreams will have come true."}
{"text":"The meat market is amazing and everything from there is absolutely top drawer! Told my husband who HATES shopping I was buying steak for my son's birthday...\"Wait for me I want to go with you!\"  That is how good this meat is!  A 60 year old man will go shopping.  Enough said.   Have not tried the restaurant. But they use the same meat. So you would have to try to screw it up to ruin those amazing meats!  Can't wait to try the restaurant. Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this meet market sense a friend of mine stumbled on it a few months ago. We regularly pick up the ribeye steaks. Every steak I have had from this place has been top notch! The quality is definitely an A+. I ended up ordering a 17lb free range fresh turkey and a 7lb ham to prepare for Thanksgiving this year. They made it so easy to order and pick up. I sent in my order form and received a confirmation email in return. The day I went to pick it all up the guys working behind the counter pulled my order and offered to carry it out to the car for me. The turkey came out perfect!! The ham was probably the best ham I've had sense I was a kid. I will absolutely be ordering my thanksgiving meats here again next year. I can't wait to see how the prime rib turns out!   The market is very clean and the customer service is great. These guys definitely know what they are talking about. Don't hesitate to ask them questions on preparation they will give you great advise.   *tip* they have chili grind! If you call ahead of time they will prepare it for you :)"}
{"text":"I am a fan. This place has a great variety of comfort foods. We love the butcher store next store. What a variety of meats and cuts. Friendly service!"}
{"text":"9 out 10 vegetarians don't shop here.  This is the best butcher shop in the Valley. Midwestern Meats has been my trusted source for 20+ years.  The staff is friendly, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable. You will find anything you need: Ribs, Burger (ground from choice cuts of beef), Chops, Premium cuts of beef, hot dogs, brats, ba-ba-BACON!. It's like a candy store.  I get my briskets and tri-tip here; I smoke 'em for 12+ hours... yowza. And every Christmas I get a 3-foot-long beef tenderloin and a prime rib the size of a regulation football.  In their frozen section, they have ¼, 1/3, and 1/2-pound patties made from their signature ground chuck. You'll find specialty burgers with all kinds of tasty add-ins, like green chile, cheddar, and bacon. Their Pot Pies are super tasty.   And if all that does not make you happy (and it should), there's an awesome bakery on site. Just think about one of those amazing 1/3 pound burgers on a bakery fresh bun. Oh Lordy!  All the breads and sweets at the bakery are top notch.  My only caution to you is that during winter the Birds flock in from all points cold. Navigating the parking lot can get dicey. But never fear, classy folks that they are, the fine folks at Midwestern Meats post someone out in the parking lot during peak times to direct traffic for your safety."}
{"text":"Great meat, great prices. You cannot go wrong with any thing inside the walls of this Mesa gem. From the cannoli in the bakery, to the corn-fed beef & specialty Brats at the meat counter, everything is fresh & high quality.  Check out Midwestern Fitness for pre-made & measured whole food nutrition packs. Great for those of us who are health conscious and on the go."}
{"text":"Meat market is awesome! Best in quality, and selection! Can't say enough about this place! A+.......Attached restaurant is a snowbird gathering place! My husband and I are retired, and felt like teenagers again, because, we were the youngest couple in the place! The restaurant is large, clean, and staffed with friendly servers. Portions are adequate, and served in a timely fashion. Food is ok, but nothing outstanding. Menu is geared to what the older crowd would enjoy. B+ over all."}
{"text":"I was there the first time I had a pork tenderloin and the food is great but the portion of mashed potatoes was a joke!!! Three bites and it was gone, they are going to skimp on the potatoes?????!!!! That was it for me I'll never go there again!!!!!"}
{"text":"First I went to the bakery.  Which is great yummy yummy stuff! Great pies and fresh bread.  The ice cream is only 50 cents! Then after weeks of this I tried the butcher shop. Unbelievable good pork chops! And bacon is wonderful! Family loved that meal I made.  Tried to get in to eat at restaurant but too packed with snowbirds :( came back with my husband and kids and are this summer after snowbirds finally left. And wow! My ribeye sandwich was great.  My husband loves his taco salad. My daughters both got chef salads and they were so huge they couldn't finish them.  The prices are unbelievably great!!! Then we found out that Monday-wed they take care of locals by offering two for one meals.  So of course we have been back alot.  In the winter the snowbirds will be back but for now this is a great deal and place.  It is on our top 5 places to eat! I give it a thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection at very reasonable prices. The phoenix butcher shop presence doesn't seem to be great, but glad we found this place. We got a 7lb pork butt for $25, smoked it for 13 hours& it was amazing! Cant wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for a couple years and may not go back anytime soon.  The two 6oz. fillets that were ordered at our table, both ordered medium rare, came totally charred on the outside, leaving a burnt taste in your mouth.  They were sent back and new ones arrived, cooked properly.  They tried to tell us the first ones were the only way they could cook them medium rare.  WRONG!  The little dishes of mixed fresh veggies were way under cooked.  Now, I like a fresh veggie, but these were only a half step from raw.  Your fork  couldn't pierce a carrot!  We asked for bread and butter plates and never got them.  One of the baked potatoes came with foil actually cut down into the potato.  Had to dig it out.  We mentioned it to the server but nothing was done about it.  Too many issues to want to come back.  Our server did send us home with 4 tiny pieces of pie for our trouble.  Best part was the sacks of dollar pastries you can buy on your way out if you're there at the right time  before they sell out!"}
{"text":"What's the big deal with this place?  After reading all these rave reviews I thought I was missing out on the meat mecca of the east valley.  I decided to check out the restaurant for a quick lunch on a Friday afternoon.  The parking lot was packed, which is always a good sign.  After first making my way into what turned out to be the bakery I made a wrong turn into the meat market.  I finally found my way into the restaurant and was seated at a tiny 2 top in between a bunch of old folks.    Not that I have anything wrong with old people, but I was there for lunch and I think they were there for an early supper!!!  I had the turkey sanwhich, which was good but nothing better than I could have made myself.  I think next time I'll just head across the street to Sprouts and get a much bigger and better sandwhich for the same price without the blue hairs."}
{"text":"Stopped to get some steaks and tried the restaurant. Pleasant surprise, ambience is a little like eating at home. Today they had beef and noodles as the special. It was terrific. For two meals and sodas, $21, not bad. Good alternative to the normal deep fried menu you see at most places."}
{"text":"My go to place for short rips and tri-tip. Growing up around the Santa Maria Valley I'm the king of tri-tip. While they don't always have it in the case, give them a few hrs notice and they will cut to order.  The bacon is great too. Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Had to ask for hot coffee since it was the same as everything else--- warm. Potatoes were burnt on one side and the biscuit with gravy was really strange tasting. Maybe that's how they do it in Iowa. The omelette has a spaghetti sauce and some shredded cheese on top. Very strange for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The meat is farm fresh and the atmosphere is like a farm house kitchen.  Service couldn't be friendlier and every visit is fantastic. I got the open face prime rib with gravy today. Very good choice if you are in the mood for beef.    Connected to the restaurant is their bakery and meat shop. The meat shop is amazing. They have some of the best burgers around. You can get a brisket burger, burger mixed with ground bacon and that's just the beginning. They have quarter ham (unsliced), bacon, sausages and more. Last time I visited I bought a whole chicken. It was so much better than store bought!   Lastly is their 2 for 1 dinners. See their website.  I was told starting May 2nd it'll be available. Ham, prime rib, pork roasts and more have been past choices."}
{"text":"I love going to a steakhouse and being able to pick it my own steak. Cooked to order. We bought a roast for home this time. It didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I always come here for the fresh fresh meats. Everything is always on point and clean. Friendly service and knowledgeable butchers are always there to help make your BBQ that much better!  Try their dry rubs and sauces! It won't disappoint! I haven't eaten at the restaurant just yet; although it always smells amazing and has a steady flow of clients.   This is the best place for fresh cuts of any meat in Mesa. Don't forget to get your kabobs dressed in their Italian seasoning!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love a great steak. I love a great burger. I really love great ribs. I'll take any of those even in a mediocre state. However, you won't find them here even in a mediocre state. Aweful cafeteria style food that makes most cafeterias seem like 5 star establishments. I had the king cut prime rib that was anything other than prime? From a butcher shop restaurant?! Had the ribs that tasted like they glued beef jerky to a bone. I actually yearned for a McRib! Lol. The potatoes tasted likr mashed cabbage and the bread was day old, dry and tastless. And they have a whole bakery? Doesn't add up! Great for the older crowd with no taste buds. Go down the street to AJs grill or Waldos for ribs and the Keg or Black Angus for a sreak. Too bad....sorry to be so blunt but man was the food aweful. Service was okay but not great. My wife noticed quite a few health violations. She's in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"1st off, the staff was very friendly and welcoming. Decided to try the stuffed burgers I've been reading about. Wow!!! Awesome!!! The flavor of the meat alone was great. I had the Diablo Burger which has bacon, cheese and jalapeños inside the meat. The serve the burgers on buns made right there at their bakery.  That was one of the best burgers I've had since moving to AZ. Topped it off with a slice of coconut cream pie, which also was completely wonderful, I now have my favorite place to get a burger, will have to work thru the menu to other items."}
{"text":"Great quality meats, DELICIOUS bakery- I'm pretty sure we've tried everything and they're all amazing. The only con is the occasional wait as they can be pretty busy."}
{"text":"Our mouth is still watering!!!!  We went here for lunch today for the first time and we're already planning our next trip.  :-)   My husband had the breaded pork sandwich and it's the best one he's had in 25 years.  I guess it's one of their most popular sandwiches and found out why.  The freshness, quality, and delectableness of this sandwich is 5-star worthy!!!!     I had a cheeseburger and it was anything but basic. The quality of meat is immediately noticed on the first bite.  The grill marks, perfect bun, and oozy cheese form a burger harmony!    We were too full for dessert which is too bad because there is a bakery attached to the restaurant and you can have your choice of pie slices for 99 cents w/ the order of a meal.  Next time!!  Oh, and there will be a next time!!!  Thank you, Midwestern Meats for bringing quality and a much needed taste uplift to the area. Never change!  :-)  See you soon...."}
{"text":"Just got back from eating lunch here with my dad... and I can safely say that I won't have to eat anything for the rest of the day...possibly the rest of the weekend.   The Bacon Cheddar Stuffed Burger I got was HUGE. It came to the table buried in lettuce, onion and tomato (which I promptly removed) as well as pickles (which I left on). I ate almost the whole burger before being tempted by a piece of Banana Cream Pie (which was AMAZING).   My only negative is I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger cooked... and I got it a little rarer than I usually like my beef. Thankfully, the melty, gooey cheese made me forget about the pinkness of the burger.  All in all, I would recommend this place for you hungry carnivores out there. Come with an appetite. I guarantee you'll be stuffed by the time you leave."}
{"text":"Always a good meal love the hometown feel inside of the restaurant quick service and great specials. You've got to try the tea here too!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a \"go to\" local restaurant for a long time...one that has been around for awhile and one that will be around for a long time...a place I can take my famiy through out the years for great food & great memories...well we found it tonight! Midwestern Meats restaurant is a small family feeling restaurant that is warm and comfortable...like going to grandma & grandpa's or a good friends home for a fantastic home cooked meal. Service was wonderful...those working seemed to be glad to be there and I could tell there was sense of experience and knowledge about running a great restaurant. The food was prepared with love by folks who actually care about cooking great food...not fancy over priced snooty food that you eat and drink with your pinky lifted...my table leg was wobbly and that was OK because everything else made up for small stuff. They have daily specials to please everyone and their deserts are just like what you dream about! The homemade bread & honey butter you get with your meal is worth the trip...it took me back to my younger days when my mom made homemade bread...and I would eat a whole loaf by muself...wonderful memories! Thanks Midwestern Meats...see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. Only 2 servers that were the greeters, cashiers and servers. Our server was not attentive to us. Our food was warm at best. We waited a long time for drinks, food and the check. If you don't have an hour or more for food, this is not the place to come. We will probably not be back. They have a lot of work to do to improve service."}
{"text":"I LOVE that I can order healthy, pre-cooked meals delivered to my front door through the \"Lifestyle Nutrition\" section. It saves me time, money, and guilt (sometimes I just don't want to cook for my fiancé after working and working out). Plus, it makes sticking to a \"diet\" easier since I rarely have to step into a grocery store and be enticed by the junk/impulse buys. Our favorites are the chicken fajitas, pancakes, chicken kabobs, and the individual cooked meats make meal planning for the week SO EASY! Throw in the Rod, the nicest guy, for quick responses and amazing delivery...you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed by the restaurant part at all...had a sirloin steak dinner. Went over to the butcher side, very friendly workers, knowledgeable.  Prices were very comparable to local grocery stores around the area.  Cant wait to go home & grill my own steaks !! Being from Wisconsin, i found the restaurant to remind me of something back in the 1950 era...not modern, not good"}
{"text":"Food was good but the bakery was the best. Please try the Lemon Merigne pie. To die for!  The yelp app was a life saver since we had no idea where to eat."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food and real fresh.  You can't go wrong here!  Everyone is real friendly also.  Very clean as well."}
{"text":"This is a first class meat market and bakery. The restaurant serves great food at a very reasonable price. You won't go away hungry!  The wait staff is very professional and friendly. Our food came out quickly and piping hot. We will be back."}
{"text":"Based on the Yelp reviews, we were excited to stop in for dinner last week. Unfortunately, the meal was mediocre at best. For a butcher, we expected a good steak. While it was cooked as ordered, medium rare, the steak was tough and chewy. The hamburger was over cooked and the fries to salty to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last week in their restaurant and we were not disappointed. I had the New York strip steak, and he had the burger with mushrooms and plenty of cheese. We absolutely loved the taste of our choice meats.  We plan to go back very soon, the restaurant is wonderful. I have not ordered from the deli yet, but I have heard that is where they really shine, so it is planned for next time."}
{"text":"This place has two businesses in one spot... great old school deli and a old fashion country restaurant."}
{"text":"Having seen a story about this place in the paper, we made the fairly long drive up there from Ahwatukee today. It's not something I would do every week, but it is worth it once in awhile.   We did not try the restaurant, but loved the meat area and the bakery. The service was really fast and extraordinarily friendly. The prices were pretty good, especially considering the fact that you know you are getting fresh product ($4.99/lb tenderloin, $3.99/lb. cubed steak, $2.99/lb on pork chops etc.). The selection was good, but not great, but the overall experience was memorable. We'll go back, especially if we are heading up that direction anyway. We're looking forward to trying their restaurant next time."}
{"text":"We ate there yesterday, on Mother's Day.  Excellent food, service, and prices.   (Prime rib with 2 sides, salad, rolls, and dessert for $12.99!)"}
{"text":"Went March 1. Place was PACKED full of snowbirds. I was the youngest person in the restaurant by 30 years. Not a problem, just amusing. Prices are good. Food quality is good for a local mom and pop place.  The bakery is very good. The meat market is pretty cool, prices are about what you'd expect at a grocery store, but the quality exceeds just about any grocery chain."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight for my husbands birthday.  The place had come recommended to us so we thought we would try it out.  First of all, we waited for about 10 minutes to even get water.  The place was NOT busy, but there was no sense of urgency whatsoever.  They brought rolls, which I was not impressed with.  Considering that they have an onsite bakery, I found it odd that the rolls tasted and looked like they came out of a bag.  I ordered the fried cod and my husband and parents ordered the prime rib.  The food was mediocre at best.  It actually reminded me a lot of a cafeteria.  The vegetable of the day was some gross mixed veggies from a can.  We will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"BUTCHER SHOP ONLY  Been a regular this butcher shop for years . . . until I moved even farther out . . . but this morning I thought some great steaks sounded good . . . so with that I decided to make the long trek back to this long forgotten butcher shop.  It was definitely worth the trip . . . the service was great . . . quick . . . and attentive . . . even though as always . . . they were extremely busy.  Not only did I pick out some great steaks . . . I also picked-up some brats / hot dogs / kabobs . . . all grilled up great.  It had been way too long since my last visit . . . but next time . . . and there will be a next time . . . it needs to be much sooner . . ."}
{"text":"Butcher: I went in looking for a good cut of meat.  My dad told me about this place, and as I was looking for fresh delicious cuts of meats it was worth the try.  I went in and received quick, friendly and excellent service.  The staff was very knowledgeable about their meats.  I got a top sirloin and a sirloin patty.  I ate them and my god.... that was fantastic!!  Delicious!  I'm going back tomorrow! Bakery: I got a few different items from here.  The cannoli, which were amazing, the baklava, which was very sweet and crisp, brownies, melted in my mouth yummy-ness, and a cupcake... Guys.... that cupcake... was AWESOME!  The cake part was moist but not gooey, it was like the cake was made from some sort of pound cake or angel food cake.  And the frosting, it was sweet but not overpoweringly sweet.  What surprised me was how much cake there was, I mean of course I expect cake to be in a cupcake but the cake to frosting ratio was very even. Meaning I didn't get a cupcake that was 90% frosting and 10%cake.   Overall: I love this place.  I will be a forever customer.  Even if in the future I move further away from this place I will go back."}
{"text":"Excellent ( consistently excellent, I might add).   Had their Breaded Pork Tenderloin Sandwich today.  Very tasty and great service!  Thank you Midwestern Meats!"}
{"text":"This was our 1st trip to Midwestern Meats and we will go back.  First we had Prime Rib dinner. It was melt in your mouth tender, cooked perfectly.  The only thing I would like to see more seasoning on the outside of the beef and the AuJus could have have had a bit more flavor. But I am a seasoning nut!  The beef vegetable soup was delicious, as well as the fresh rolls.  After dinner we had the 99¢ piece of pie, that was good too.  Then we went to the meat shop and to my surprise they had Pork Hocks and Side Pork.  Since moving here from Wisconsin 10 years ago I have not found these items in any grocery store.  I am delighted, I bought both.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, I always have driven by and they have always been packed. My girlfriend and I spent 30 minutes or so just browsing their deli and sweat treat area. Then ended up going to have a late breakfast. It was awesome I am a big breakfast fan and I will definately being going back. I want to try their deli and desserts, but the people working there were absolutely outstanding. Great Customer Service."}
{"text":"Where to begin. Heard rave reviews about this place unfortunately the restaurant was not quality food! The salad was old and wilted, I had a tbone steak that was burnt and lacked seasoning. My kids disliked their food as well. The stuffed burger lacked seasoning and taste! The cod fish lacked flavor. Fifty dollars later and I left hungry and grossed out! I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Can't get em' like this any more. High quality corn fed meat from the Midwest. This place has an excellent meat market, butcher, bakery, and restaurant with home style dishes,  just like grandma use to make.  Decor and style is from the 1940'-50s just like most of the customers. Did I mention they deliver and have homemade jerky. Stop by here before your next BBQ."}
{"text":"They short you on your order. However they make good on it by refunding what they shorted."}
{"text":"Wow Anna the waitress was the rudest one one here. Definitely miss the restaurant. The meat shop attached is pretty decent though"}
{"text":"I'm from Iowa and this is one of very few places west of Nebraska where you can get a fried pork tenderloin sandwich.  The homemade bakery items are very good too. There is a meat counter and grocery opposite the restaurant.  Great meats, bacon,  and sausages. Don't forget to grab a jar of Boetjes brand mustard before you go!"}
{"text":"Food was average but the service was terrible!  Waitress seemed totally put out at our presence and even hung her purse on a chair at a table next to ours seemingly to imply she was ready to leave but we had fouled that up by walking in.  We asked only 3 questions and were met with curt responses.  I ordered a stuffed burger and swapped my fries for the twice baked potato and still was charged the full price for the damned thing.  So my burger and potato came out to over 15 bucks with taxes and they refused to give me credit for the fries that I traded in... never again..."}
{"text":"They got the best prime steaks around and the Diablo potatoes are great great people great service"}
{"text":"Quality beef, knowledgeable staff, great prices!  Midwest Meats is an excellent place to buy all your meat products.  If you want a special cut, just call ahead.  They're very accommodating to your needs.  Don't forget to try the baked goods from the adjoining bakery--stunning array of pastries!  If you want a damn good hamburger, get some freshly ground sirloin, peppered bacon, and some of their freshly baked buns. YUM!"}
{"text":"I love the meat shop and the bakery makes great cakes.   This is a review for and warning about the restaurant.   The service is extremely slow.  The food is just ok, not great.   My husband ordered a Monte Cristo and said it was good.  I ordered the banana cream pie.  It was basically a thick banana pudding with whipped cream on top.  Here's what really drives the one star rating.   They allow dogs inside the restaurant at the tables.  Not just service dogs but house pets and on this occasion there was a lady hand feeding her dog from her plate!  The dog was actually better behaved than the lady.  I have pets myself and I love to frequent dog friendly places but I stay on the patio with my dogs & don't hand feed them from my plate.  Gross.   I was not the only diner who found this upsetting.   I'll stick with the meat shop & bakery from now on."}
{"text":"Still hoping to get a decent steak at this overpriced grocery store is over.  I picked-up two Porterhouse steaks for a birthday person.  They didn't look that great for their huge price, but it had been a while since I had a nice piece of meat.  As usual, this establishment disappointed.  The steak was tough (I know how to grill people), and flavor wise \"identical\" to what you can get at any grocer for $6.99 lb.  or less.  No mas!  Stay away from their steaks.  Fry's and Safeway, for the price, WAY better."}
{"text":"Average everything from breakfast to lunch or dinner. Their meats are always good, but everything else is prosaic. For example, if you order their prime rib dinner, the meat is fine but you get the same baked potato and frozen mixed vegetables with any meal you choose.. Unless you want French fries. Lunch meals are similar. Breakfast choices have no flair. Commercial cooking for \"meat and potatoes\" Midwesterners. Great butcher shop, however. Lots of variety and the meats are PRIME not choice. Excellent frozen case."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times to purchase deli and meats. Always a great experience.   I noticed the restaurant every time I went and finally took the time to check the place out. I figure, it's good over here, it's gotta be good over there, right? Wrong. Walked in and from the beginning, I was treated poorly. They made me feel like a burden, totally unwelcome. Our waitress was an older, short red haired lady. Okay so, I ordered wine... I should have taken a photo... most disgusting glass I've ever seen in a restaurant. Not only was there hard water/soap stains, but there was other gunk, grim, and color on the glass. I wanted to vomit. If the glass was that gross, I can't imagine what the rest of their kitchen looks like... disgusting. I ended up paying for the drinks; I should have just left. I just wanted to run. All I could think about was leaving and getting as far away as possible.   I'll probably go back for their meats and cheeses.. maybe... idk, their bakery goods aren't very good either. And kind of afraid of sanitation issues..."}
{"text":"We live just around the corner from Midwestern Meats Restaurant, Bakery, and Deli. We LOVE the bakery, we go there at least once a week for donuts. They have the BEST donuts. We have NEVER had anything there that wasnt amazing. The meats from the deli are a little higher than your local grocer but they are fresh and taste great. So you get what you pay for. Ive never eaten in the restaurant but I cant imagine it being anything but wonderful!!"}
