{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to Five Guys, and I must admit that I enjoy their burgers every time I go there. This time, I went for ALL the toppings aka \"All the Way\",  to go with my bacon cheeseburger and I loved it! It was really messy to eat because the burger was so big with all the toppings inside, but its definitely worth it. The bun and beef patties were juicy and fresh and I loved that the free toppings included mushrooms - which I happen to LOVE to have on burgers. The burger was only around $9 including tax... give it a try if you're by Ikea...! I also had cajun fries. This time, there  were a bit mushy, but my previous times there, the fries were super fresh and tasted better... guess it depends on if you're lucky."}
{"text":"I had to sign up for Yelp just to put this issue to rest: Five Guys is overrated. It pales in comparison to BP and I don't even know how these guys are mentioned in the same breath as In-N-Out in the states (maybe their ingredient sourcing is better).   These guys have no respect for burger construction. My cheeseburger came out of the foil smushed looking like a meat pie of grease. The product vaguely reminds me of Burger King actually. Their cheese doesn't melt right and tastes a tad too sweet. The bun did not impress either. Their fries were pretty uninspiring as well and weren't consistently crispy. They reminded me of the fries from an arena I used to play hockey at. Love the fries in the bag gimmick, me and my date ended up with a whole other serving of fries! Props for using peanut oil too.  The patty is pretty good. But you can definitely taste the difference when the meat is freshly ground and seasoned. I noticed that their patties come pre-seasoned out of the box...ugh.  Overall, Five Guys feels too much like a chain for me and I won't be going back. Everything I observed in the kitchen from the ingredients to the cooking processes did not display anything that justified me spending 14 bucks."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are definitely yummy, but the environment is completely obnoxious. The endless walls of red and white checkers are even overwhelming for a Croatian like me. The music drives me insane. I'll need to check this place out again in the summer since they have a cozy patio on Detroit which I highly commend them for (I hope more Lakewood restaurants do this). Hopefully their ridiculous soundtrack doesn't resonate through the front windows.  And I really hope they didn't setup any outdoor speakers."}
{"text":"I've heard that this place and In n Out Burger are the new kings of American fast food. I really liked In n Out when I've visited California/Nevada and I was really looking forward to the east coast equivalent.  I have to say the burgers are really good, maybe better than In and Out and definitely better than McD, Wendy's, BK, etc.    I didn't however like the fries.  I had the cajun fries and my girlfriend and other friend had the regular fries.  I enjoyed the cajun seasoning but the fries were overcooked and not very tasty.  yes they were all over the bag (like some other reviewers mentioned) but that was on purpose.  After they put the fries in the bag they dump a bunch more in with them so I can't really complain about that.  If you in the area I'd definitely try them out.  I live over half and hour away and I consider my trip worthwhile."}
{"text":"Juicy burger perhaps one of the best aside from home grilled yourself. The fries are a must have cooked in peanut oil, mm mm good!  Watch out for becoming addicted though, artery clogging can occur."}
{"text":"The employees are nice.  The food is too greasy. The fry portion is very generous.   It made my wife sick. The floors are sticky."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one brief.  Fantastic Burgers, love the customization options. Extremely generous amount of fries given out.  Just try and avoid the rush hour... otherwise it's a long long wait. (At least you get free peanuts and the soda is bottomless!)"}
{"text":"This is definitely not diet food or fine dining. But it is delicious. The decor is pretty sparse and the tables are set up so they can be moved around to accomodate groups of different sizes. We've been there a number of times where the line up is long and the tables are full, but it's a place where people tend to enjoy their food and leave rather than linger so it usually doesn't take long to get a table.   There are highchairs near the door on the opposite side of the line-up which can be hard to find if you don't know they are there. They also have some little pieces of paper and crayons hung on the wall nearby.    One of the things I found surprising, is that they don't really have a kids menu. The \"small burger\" is just a regular burger with 1 patty instead of two. I highly recommend giving that option a try unless you have a really big appetite. I love the cajun fries, but they are a bit spicy - my son didn't like them at all. They fill up your cup of fries and then dump another scoop in your bag so you get way more than you'd think. Most people take the burgers out of their bag and then rip the top half of the bag off to eat the fries."}
{"text":"To begin: I give this place four stars because of their excess and extremity in the world of burger, not necessarily because these were the best burgers I've ever had.   That said, they are pretty good, if you are seeking crazy, over the top, sauce-slathered messy insanity in your burger--because they are all that and more--check out the photo of the burger uploaded by RJ S.--this is what they actually do look like (topping dependent, of course).   This place basically takes the concept of burger to 11, then doubles it, making the products of other burger places (at least in Canada) seem restrained and quiet by comparison. I'm simultaneously fascinated and horrified by the excess of these burgers. They tasted pretty good, too, but I did feel a bit sick after eating mine--maybe just from the thought of how insanely unhealthy they are?  Which is basically to say that I wouldn't want to go here every day, or even more than say... once a year or so. I don't think my arteries could stand it. And I ordered the \"small\" size. But, if you are as fascinated as I am by crazy and novel variations on standard food offerings, then this is definitely one to check out.  Note: if there are two of you and you both want fries, order the smaller size of fries (this is what we did, and we didn't even come close to finishing them, especially after the burgers!). The large size could likely feed a small nation.   Also: Though I didn't try the regular fries, the Cajun ones are good."}
{"text":"By far the best burger joint in Charlotte.  I've been to several locations in Charlotte and pretty much have the same experience in all of them. Menu is small and to the point. Nothing fancy here, just big delicious and very messy burgers.  The fries are good too, just wish they had a smaller  size.  Three people can eat out of the small."}
{"text":"Un peu déçu de ce Resto. En premier je trouve que l'on paie trop pour ce que l'on a."}
{"text":"Five Guys has some cred behind it. Obama goes to Five Guys. If it's good enough for the President of the United States, surely it could be good enough for the former student council co-president of Riverview High School.  Located in Deerfoot Meadows, practically next-door to their biggest competiton, Five Guys is the latest in premium burger joints to hit Calgary. By premium burger joints I mean it is very similar to South St. Burger Company, where they charge a premium and tell you that you are getting quality that you don't get at other places (McDonald's, Wendy's, etc...).  The place was packed. Almost lined up out the door. Don't expect to walk in and out of this place in 5 minutes. Obviously they're french fries are hand cut on site because you are greeted by about 40 huge bags of potatoes stacked just insde the front door. While you wait in line, you can help yourself to free peanuts. The place is big and the kitchen is an open concept. Everything happens right in front of your eyes. It looks like you would expect a burger place to look like, but they could definitely improve on the atmosphere. It is loud. There is no music playing, and they girl who calls out the orders, literally shouts at the top of her lungs, which became annoying.  On to the food. I ordered a cheese burger, fries and drink. When I opened it up, I thought they mistakenly gave me a double burger but that is just how they serve it. I ordered it \"All the way,\" which is just a fancy way for saying \"the works.\" The burger was huge, and sloppy. It wouldn't be something you would want to take with you and eat in your car. It was very good - definitely better than your standard fast food burger. I read in other reviews that two people could share one order of fries. They weren't joking. The portion of fries were massive. Impossible (for me) to finish, but they were so good that you would want to try to.  The meal came to just over $13. Almost twice as much as you would spend at your typical fast food place. Was it worth it? Yes. You get a ton of food. I ate lunch at 1:00 pm, and only had a little snack at 7:00 pm that night because I was still full from lunch.  Five Guys is worth checking out. 8/10"}
{"text":"The Prices are comparable to gourmet burger joints and the quality is nowhere near that level. Mediocre."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are fresh and delicious. And they provide as many napkins as you want (and they are actually good quality napkins) - very important since the burgers get pretty messy! My only minor complaint is that the single-patty \"small\" burger is not listed on the menu. I accidentally ordered a regular burger that came with two patties because I forgot about this, and could only finish half."}
{"text":"I know someone who was dying to come here, but then couldn't due to a peanut allergy (fries are cooked in peanut oil, and peanuts in the shell everywhere for snacking).    Well, you'll just have to take my word for it:, my friend:  it sucks to be you!!  This place is GREAT!!  My first experience at 5 guys was at a different location, and a bit of an aberration (the food wasn't so hot... ).    So far, here, it's satisfied every gluttonous, sloppy topping, morbid-to-be-someday  food craving.  Yeah, the menu isn't super expansive, but why water it down and do everything a little less well for a few fringe orders.  Stick with the core, and do it well.  And everyone knows what they are in for when they walk through the door.    Massive.  Good.  Food.  One star deduction because one burger was a little ... pink... in the center when I got home.  Still ate it, though.  Eff it.     Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012 - 27/30"}
{"text":"Good burgers and funny that it is right across the street from FatBurger. First bite gave me the impression that I was at Peter's Drivein. I think it was because I got too many toppings and made it too drippy. If you go, keep it to about 4 toppings max. The best part was the fries. Lots and really fresh. Grilled cheese is perfect for kids. Not for those trying to lose those extra Christmas pounds. I'll go again the next time I'm in the Meadows. Much better quality than FatBurger."}
{"text":"I swear to god I rather have five guys for thanksgiving than a thanksgiving turkey, i rather have five guys than a girlfriend, i rather have five guys than a job, i truly believe a five guy's burger could cure cancer. Some people wish they could be famous, some people wish they could be rich, i just wish i could have a five guys' burger at least once a week for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"thank god!  i  do miss in and out the first time i tried it... but thank god this place came along!! i LOVE burgers I do... and these were 5 stars!! loved it, worth the wait , but it goes fast.... they opened one in Airdrie  so it is closer to me, i can t wait to go there and try it!!!"}
{"text":"good burgers but way overpriced in my opinion.....i need to be wowed before I get hosed!"}
{"text":"So yummy, in and out...SO MUCH BETTER than Fatburger across the way, went back there to see if it was as good as I thought it was before Five Guys opened...no comparison, Five guys is tops."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Food is delicious and the place itself is very clean and organized. It can be a bit pricy, but it's worth it. Make sure you give the Cajun French fries a try the next time you visit. The unlimited peanuts is a plus!"}
{"text":"Five guys is a typical fast food in the sense of decor, very simple ( can get messy when its busy, they have peanuts they offer for free and the shells get tossed everywhere) Customer service...well its a bunch of the same young kids found anywhere..friendly enough, but dont care to engage you in conversation..but I didnt care about doing that either when I was 16.  The servings are HUGE. They dont skimp on any of the toppings or the portions size of fries, and I find the quality of burger a lot better than your regular fast food joints. The baby burger is the only size I get. It looks like a bomb exploded in its wrapper. It makes it difficult to manuever, but I can look past this. All over a great place for a greasy, filling fix of beef. They also offer grill cheese sandwiches and a kids menu too!"}
{"text":"BEST burger place in town I recently discovered this place because of one of my buddies of mine decided to go there after Ikea and since I have known about it has been worth the drive all the way down since Im across the city. I would say that they are better then their competition in the area (fatburgers) I would take five guys any day. Their Cajun fries are the best!! Very simple which is what their key is to good burgers"}
{"text":"The menu is super-narrow.  If you want anything other than a burger and fries, you can;t get it The burgers are huge, not very tasty and with all the possible junk you can put on , it reminds me why America has a huge weight problem.  It actually tasted unhealthy! They advertise a five dollar burger, which turns out to be a baby burger.  My family each had a burger, and we split fries and pops and it cost us $44!  Way too expensive Eating area crowded, uncomfortable.  Sparse decor.  Very fast-food ish, at sit down restaurant prices. Canada, run the other way!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite affordable burger joint in Calgary!! (sorry fat) thank you washington for coming here! (After Rays hell burger , five guys is the second best burger joint in DC)  You must go ' all the way' and do not miss out on the cajun fries. It gets extremely busy during 11 to 2 so prepare yourself to walk into a space full of activity. Apparently you can call in to order ahead and skip the line.  This is where i go for a bite of DC."}
{"text":"They definitely do NOT have the best burgers in town!  They flatten and pound them out so bad they almost disappear in the oversized bun.  They give you more bacon than burger.  I ordered extra mayo and got extra lettuce instead.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  They are too expensive and do not deliver on quality."}
{"text":"If you're having a craving for a whopper, then this might be a nice alternative. But after all the hype, I'm a little disappointed. It's definitely still a fast-food style burger in a fast-food style store, but one you have to wait ten minutes to get."}
{"text":"I have eaten at five guys all over the US and they do not disappoint here in Canada. The consistency is amazing and their burgers and fries are the best in town..any town!! If you want a fantastic burger. .this is the place.  and the fries..oh those fries!"}
{"text":"These Guys just get it right,great burgers straight forward toppings hand cut fries.I've eaten here on more than a few occasions with the family and everyone loves it.Counter service is always polite and expeditious .Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great burgers.  You can have it any way you like.  The fries are excellent as well, just be aware that you get a lot of them.  I mean a sack full, so order the small size."}
{"text":"I'm convinced the only thing Five Guys has going for them is the novelty that they're so popular in the US... And possibly the peanuts, though I never got offered any as I waited.  I wasn't even hungry when I went, but since it's out of the way from where I live, I wanted to try it while I could.  I ordered the little cheeseburger at $6 with grilled mushrooms.  No other condiments - I'm a purist when it comes to burgers.  For that price point, I was expecting more than slimy, processed cheese and a store bought bun.  Would it kill them to toast it since they're making me wait anyway?  The burger had a decent beef flavour, but it was a tad under done.  I can't for the life of me figure out why people would choose this burger over a Wendy's or a Lick's burger.  Sure, they have unlimited toppings, but is that only so they can hide the mediocrity of their burgers?  I also found it quite funny that the store is decorated with clippings of their rave reviews from years and years past in the US.  Clearly no one's touting their greatness above the border to update their decor."}
{"text":"I didn't actually read any of the Yelp reviews before hitting this joint.  I knew there was a new place in Deerfoot Meadows and I wanted to try it.  I had previously heard from a co-worker that it was so so but I wanted to experience it for myself.  Seems most of the previous reviewers like this place.  I on the other hand did not think much of it.    It was pretty busy when I was there on Christmas Eve.  I liked the sound of any amount of toppings that you want on the burger.  My partner and I ordered one to share without realizing that a 'normal' burger was with two patties, so it was a good thing that we only ordered one.  We also ordered some fries and the portion was huge.  The fries were pretty good but the burger was sloppily put together.  When I opened the wrapper it turned my appetite off a little bit when I saw this mess of thing sitting there.  It felt like the young kitchen crew didn't really care about the product they were sending out.  The burger itself wasn't super in my opinion.  I've definitely had better and while quantity might be a great attraction to some, I think I would rather have an awesome tasting normal sized burger than a gigantic one that tastes mediocre.  I don't think I would return here again.  If you're extremely hungry and looking for a lot of food, this is a good place to go to.  Otherwise I would recommend going somewhere else to satiate that burger crave."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet.   Almost intimidating for a first time visit, but worth it.  Here are a couple of tips so you don't look like a \"rookie\"  -Pop refills are free -Any burger on the menu is a double patty -A \"Junior\" burger, if requested, is only a single patty -I hope you like lots of fries -Make sure you know what you want BEFORE you get up to the counter to order so you don't hold up the line -When they give you your receipt, there is a bold number on there. This is your order number. Make sure to pay attention to the guy yelling out the numbers for your order number. -Burgers are very messy, especially if you ask for it \"loaded\" or \"all the way\"  Just a really interesting place to grab a bite to eat. Don't let the long lines turn you away. 25-30 people in line will only take about 7-15 min depending on orders... (Most people spend a longer time in Tim Horton's Drive thru, even though there is nobody waiting in line inside the store...)  **Just a side note: If you eat here, and by some miracle are still hungry afterwards, try eating a D.F.T.R. burger from Boogies Burgers."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my boyfriend the other day because he was craving a burger. Personally, this place was nothing extra special, but good for a fast food joint considering you can choose your own toppings for no extra charge.   My boyfriend ordered the Cheeseburger while I ordered the Little Cheeseburger. Be aware that the 'Little' burgers are not mini burgers (what I initially thought). 'Little' burgers have one patty, while the regular burgers have TWO patties. I love my burgers stuffed, so I was glad to know they had mushrooms as one of their toppings. I would recommend getting the cajun fries along with your meal.   **NOTE: When you enter the shop, there is a giant pile of peanuts that are available for customers to scoop themselves into a small paper container provided."}
{"text":"I will be honest. It was NOT good. All my friends in the states recommended this as the best burger ever, I also heard friends in Kingston loved it., Obama loves it!...I guess this location ruined it for us. I sat there watching naive people walk in, line up with a big smile on  their faces and walk out disappointed.... do not go. Burgers were dry and not flavorful not worth my $9.00"}
{"text":"Took my Wife and 2 kids to 5-Guys at MacLeod Trail the other day.  We all had the double cheese burger, fries and pop.  Everybody thought the burgers and fries were delicious.  Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"5 Guys, now thats a real burger.  You would have gotten 5 stars if parking wasn't a total nightmare near your store.  Not to much I can say that other people haven't already.  I love when ordering you just tell the everything you want on it.  The workers are always friendly and hard working.  The fries aren't the best, but you do get a ton.  I recommend a small.  I appreciate the fresh potatoes cut into fries.  However, if they soaked them first it would help prevent them from becoming soggy.  Your fry bag will look as if you dipped it in water when finished.   The meat itself is a good quality.  I would put this burger up against many of the top in Cleveland and it could hang.  Anything can beat that Micheal Symon Slop Shop B-Spot.  What a joke!!  \"Hey this is how your burger is going to be and you are going to like it.\" GO POUND SAND MIKE."}
{"text":"I want to say are you kidding? This has to be one of the most over rated and overpriced burger joints around. I went with my husband and two teenagers for a late lunch and left there paying $45.56! This was for 2  regular burgers at $6.29 each,1 smaller burger at $3.89 and one smaller burger with bacon that tasted like it was an inferno victim at $4.89 plus 4 fries at $2.99 each and 4 drinks at $2.19 each. Granted there were lots of fries left over and perhaps we could have ordered just two but still the burgers were bland at best, not this juicy patty that i had been hearing so much about, my tomato was on the green side and the mayo was slopped on but i think that was an attempt to cover the horrible bacon which should never have been used in the first place. The staff was not overly friendly, but most of them were just teens, typical of most fast food places so I guess that's not really an issue. My first complaint is really the quality of the food, even the fries, I asked the young girl how hot were the cajun fries and was told  \"very spicy\"  well no they were not, unless you consider a sprinkle of paprika spicy. But the biggest complaint is the price $6.29 for a hamburger? Sorry not for me, maybe in a nice sit down restaurant, with some flavor but this? Nah. Needless to say we wont be back."}
{"text":"The only previous visit was to a Five Guys in Montana. I couldn't remember much about it except there were free peanuts. Stopped in for lunch today, 10 minutes after it opened and it was busy, 80% of the tables were occupied which is pretty good turnout for before noon on a Saturday. The service was good except it is very noisy and I had trouble hearing her. The garnish selection is overwhelming, far exceeding what the mind can process on a Saturday morning. I found the burger a bit dry but this could be a result of my garnish selection, I suspect my opinion would differ with a change in toppings, for example the addition of tomatoes.   Unlike my previous visit, I will remember this visit. I will definitely go back, not sure how often with the selection of food outlets in Deerfoot Meadows."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the place was good, and priced alright, but meh. As some would say \"it's nothing to write home about\"  The food was good... I had a little burger, it was more than enough for me but the boyfriend said he wished he had gotten the double. We shared a regular fry, which was a good idea as there was no way I would have eaten my own. In my opinion the fries were better than the burger. They were hot, and salty and cajun pepper tasting. I loved em'  They weren't dirty though, so to speak. There was peanut shells everywhere as they provide a carton for the wait, but considering how busy they were all the empty tables were clean and I saw them bring out (yes, bring out. As in they took the dirty garbages to the back and swapped them out for a fresh ones) twice while we were there. However I never did use the bathroom there so can't say much about the cleanliness of that.  All in all, an ok experience. I will eat there again when I'm in the mood for good fries. I think I'm more fond of Fat Burger though as they do offer more selection (hello milkshakes) and sometimes the price is worth it"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. Juicy and tasty. Fries are wonderful too."}
{"text":"Juicy meat, nice fried onions, lots of fries and bottomless drinks.  But....it is one of those restaurants which requires you bring a spare set of clothes with you. You WILL smell like oil and fries afterwards !!"}
{"text":"Great, great burgers. Fries are too big for two people, let alone one. An excellent addition to the 416/905 and one of the GTA's best burgers. Strongly recommended! I thought the novelty would wear off...I was wrong."}
{"text":"PIcked up a cheeseburger to go on Friday night.  I opted for the single patty, which was enough for me.  My husband and friend each got the double patty.  The burger was good, the toppings were typical (but that's all I need - I'm not looking for anything fancy).  The bun was better than you'd get at a multinational fast-food chain burger joint, but comparable to other places like Licks.  The fries were great, and they give you tons - even when you order the smaller size.  I see from reviews that the Cajun fries are great too, so I'm wishing I'd tried those - maybe next time.  Yes, there will be a next time - it was a satisfying burger, and I would always choose a fresh burger like this as my preference for a fast food meal.  It didn't WOW me, but I liked it.  The decor is definitely that of a fast food joint - bright fluorescent lights, cold/hard furniture, and white walls everywhere.  It was fine and clean if you need to eat in, but just lacking in atmosphere.   I was glad I was taking it home."}
{"text":"I feel like becoming a vegetarian after eating Five Guys mainly because the burger did not taste nor look appetizing. The taste and smell is hard to describe, but it seemed like I was eating a real cow. I'll let you judge for yourself."}
{"text":"My staff and I order here often. There was a couple months when I would return every other day because it was just that good!!  Service is always great. They remember me by face and all the staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Good if you want a fresh, American-style, well-done cheesy greasy burger and fries.   Definitely overpriced, and so treat it as a delicacy and not as a regular thing.   Big portions, they give you two servings of fries per combo and peanuts are free. The fries were average and I wish they were better (since you get so many) but overall the meal is satisfying.   Friendly staff, and if you ignore peanut shavings, the place is not bad either."}
{"text":"For what it's worth, the burgers and fries here are really good. The free peanuts are also a nice touch.  The service? Great as well, got the food cooked and out to us quick, fast and in a hurry. Flava Flav would have been proud.  By now I would guess you're wondering why it is, if the food was good, I got free nuts in my mouth (perverts...) and the service was good, that I am giving them two stars.  The two star review starts about three hours after we ate dinner. Both of us looked at each other like someone had just gone Hiroshima on my stomach, and Nagasaki all up in my special lady's insides. The gut bomb this place dropped on us can only be summed up best by NPH. It was leg-en-dary! And not in the good way.  My stomach only reacts to burgers in this manner, which is to say food coma followed up with several highly amusing, ass cheek clenching full power sprints to the toilet bowl, if the burger in question is really, really, really epically bad for you from a nutritional level.   If \"massive ass-splosions and sprinting\" were Olympic track and field events, Five Guys would be the only food I would train with and I would be an instant international celebrity with my several gold medals in rectal detonation. Women would hang all over me, being so impressed by my prowess to shotgun blast the porcelain with my trap door blaster, that they would even offer to wipe me up like a four year old or George Bush after a coke bender.  I really wish I could have found it in my heart to give this place even three stars, but the truth is that my heart, and I fear most of my internal organs, have been sucked out of my system and down the drain by my now spastic colon.  All that being said, still a damn fine burger, just a high residual cost down the back side of it."}
{"text":"For the record, we are long time Five Guys fans.  Eat there regularly.  But why is it that this one seems to specialize in goofing up some part of our order when we do take out?    You shouldn't have to open up your packages before leaving the restaurant to ensure everything is 1) there and 2) accurate.  But this location makes you rethink that.  :-("}
{"text":"This place was very pricey for a very usual burger. burgers are big but not as delicious ,besides fries quality were terrible . they were all burnt and very salty I mean seriously overly salty , for 5 burgers combos we paid 72$ !!!!!! Which is 2 times compare to other places. my little son vomited the whole food after having this burger . Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"\"What goes in, must come out!\"  ... is what I thought when I saw the burger.    I didn't realize a 'regular' burger was a double patty.  Next time, must order properly as I couldn't finish the double patty.   The meat is tasty-you can tell it's fresh ground beef, and the meat to bun ratio (had it been one patty) was really good.  My only complaint is that the cheese is that VERY processed Kraft singles type cheese, whereas I prefer the sliced real cheddar cheese.    Overall, yummy.  A bit pricy, but a tasty treat once in awhile."}
{"text":"It's hamburger and fries. It's not healthy and it's very pricy for what it is. I do not see myself eating here very often. At this price level I can go to a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great burger and awesome fries.  For comparison purposes it's about 1 step above in'n out but 2 steps up in price.  No shakes......which I think is a must with a good burger, me and my kid lived since potbelly has awesome shakes just two doors down."}
{"text":"Besides the usual great food, this location played Peter Gabriel era Genesis \"Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\" on the sound system.  Made this 70's graduate very happy."}
{"text":"Great burgers, toppings and fries. They should add gravy and Poutine to the menu.  Simple burger well made."}
{"text":"At the Airdrie, AB location yesterday we tried Five Guys Burgers and Fries out for the first time. Burger itself tasted good. However, the presentation and how it was cooked & packaged could tell it's own story. Kinda like a carpet that needed to be cleaned. Will try again at the Calgary location next time."}
{"text":"My brother and I especially like this burger place because it has nice retro burger joint feel. It's expensive but definitely worth it. I especially like the Caijun frites. There burgers are well done and you can top them with sautéed mushrooms, grilled onions, jalapeño peppers and also classic toppings such as tomatoes onions and your choice of sauces. The other items on the menu Include hot dogs and junior burgers. Oh yeah there's peanuts there and you can enjoy them while you wait for the burgers to be done."}
{"text":"I have no idea why anybody would give this place a bad review.  First of all, they don't put TOO much cheese.  It's 1 slice - a normal amount.  It doesn't cost $16 for a combo.  A single patty cheeseburger for example costs 5.99.  So it might cost you over $10 for a burger, fry and drink but it costs you close to $10 for the same at McDonald's or Harvey's and there is no comparison in taste or quality.  You can get either a small, med or large fry.  I don't know what this other person is talking about saying that the portion is too big?  I think somebody is out to smear this place for some unknown reason.  The burger was perfectly cooked and tasty, the toppings were perfect, the bun was extremely fresh and the fries were fresh and home cut, the best I've ever had.  The place was clean, I liked the music and ambiance, the service was fast and friendly.  There was nothing not to like.  I give this place a big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that people would line up for these burgers.  Personally I can make a better one at home and the Cajun salt poured over our FF just about killed my husband and me...mind you, I think the FF would have been awesome without the salt so if you must go ask for no salt and add your own.  I like a veggie burger also and none were offered.    Been there.,,,,done that...."}
{"text":"HEYYYYY! It's about time we get a proper burger joint in this city! When your own city lacks the creativity and inspiration to have more than two properly run burger joints, seeing a 5 guys really makes me optimistic: maybe someone could open a place that could compete with that. Ah, nevermind, they'll open some loungeburger bullshit, cause you can make more money in the short term off shitty $20 burgers than really good $6 burgers.  The place, however, is unlike their well run outlets in DC. Where in the US the long lineups move quick, up here they are tedious. During the lunch rush, they were running 1 till. Then they clued in that they should maybe open more. So they stretched their resources thin and opened one additional till. There were also two clerks at every till. So a lineup 30 people deep took about 20 minutes for them to process. Annnnnd, the pricing. $7.50 for a bacon cheese. Ughhh. But, this is west Scandinavia, afterall.  Great food, but this place needs to be run better."}
{"text":"If you want a good quality burger without firing up the grill, drop by the Five Guys Burgers and Fries.  The first thing you will notice when you enter the doors are bags of peanuts piled knee high and are a added bonus for those hungrily waiting for their orders.  Already you can tell that this was a casual and relaxed environment. Judging from the traffic that was going in and out of this restaurant, it could have only meant one thing... great food.  This isn't your regular fast food burger joint.  The patties are not frozen and only put on the grill after each order, ensuring that each burger was served fresh and not sitting on the grill to dry out for the next order.  I had the bacon cheese burger and you have your choice of about a dozen or so free toppings. The burger was juicy and had great flavour, the fresh grilled mushrooms and onions were a great complement. We added Cajun fries and they were spicy, tasty and plentiful. They really don't skimp out on anything around here, it was as if they were trying to get rid of all their toppings in our two burgers. All in all, this is a great place for lunch or dinner and a much more satisfying alternative to your average fast food burger."}
{"text":"What do you say about Five Guys that hasn't been said before?  Burgers are definitely better than the fast food average. With unlimited toppings (and some nice ones like fried onions or fried mushrooms) it's tempting to load up the burger. Avoid the temptation. The key to maximizing your Five Guys experience seems to be not getting over zealous with the toppings and managing moisture. The burgers themselves are tasty, but not terribly large; adding a mess of fried onions, pickles and tomatoes usually seems to just create a burger mess.  My sweet-spot tends to be: - Cheeseburger - Jalapenos (fresh, not pickled. This adds decent heat and a nice vegetal low-end to the burger.) - Raw onion (the grilled onion tastes good, but makes the burger too soggy) - Lettuce, no tomato (again, brings the sog) - Ketchup, mayo, relish, but BBQ sauce and mustard on the side  I usually order the regular fries, as I find the Cajun a little to salty. Fries can be hit-and-miss, sometimes ending up undercooked and under salted. When they're \"on\" however, just dump them into your bag and rip off the top for a classy and convenient paper serving vessel.  I only ever get a reg. drink, with free refills I'm not sure what the lure of the large is. I should also note that every time I've been there it seems like the soda is a little \"lean\" (less syrup, or maybe just more carbonation if they are using pre-mix?). I really like that, my wife not so much. We also disagree on the \"ambiance\"...she finds it a little cold and off-putting, while I try to argue that it reflects a singular interest in good burgers...no extras, no decorating, no marketing, just burgers."}
{"text":"For fast food, the burgers and fries are good. There's usually a wait due to line and cooking time. If you're in a rush, I'd go elsewhere but their burgers, hot dogs and fries are great. I'm a big fan of fresh cut fries and they do it well."}
{"text":"My fav burger in the GTA.  Its a bit pricey but man the toppings are insane.  Jalapenos are my fav on these.  I don't get the cheese because it covers up the beefy taste of the bacon and beef.  Only down side is a lot of oil/grease is in the air while your eating.  Bad ventilation system even though the system looks very new and massive."}
{"text":"PEANUT ALLERGY ALERT: Five Guys has two huge boxes of in-shell peanuts just sitting out, free for anyone to nibble on. As a result.. there are peanuts everywhere in this joint; on the floors, tables... everywhere! If you have a severe peanut allergy... run away as fast as you can! Now, onto the review...  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with \"everything\" on it.  The Good: The beef patties, tomatoes and jalapeños were fresh and juicy. The patties were the best part of the entire burger... the grilled mushroom and onion topping was quite tasty, so it comes second.   The (Overwhelmingly) Bad: The bun was your typical industrialized food style sugary junk that turned into a soggy mess. The \"cheese\" was processed/consistency of cheez whiz. It ruined the whole burger flavor. Fries (real potato) were ok but quickly turned soggy... Too salty for my tastebuds.  I don't understand why this place has so many amazing reviews. It's just a typical blah burger joint in an uninspired SW location. The music was extremely loud and the place was utterly disgusting... peanut shells everywhere, dirty tables, dirty floors, overflowing garbage can... the works. I used to work at McDonalds as a teenager... and we never, ever let it get anywhere near as messy as Five Guys was last night.   Five Guys claims that their food is quality... but it is, in fact, slop. It's a shame, really, because the actual patties are done well... but then they ruin a perfectly good patty by pairing it with a gross bun, gross processed cheese, and salt. TONS of salt.  Menu items were overpriced for what you get. Quality is lacking here. This place is all about stuffing bland, sugary, salty food into your mouth as fast as possible... It's not about enjoying the flavor of food. So sad that a place like this (and that their food) could get so many glowing reviews."}
{"text":"The 1 star is probably a tad harsh... but seriously, overrated. The prices are unreasonable ($13 for a burger, drink and fries). The actual burgers are nothing special, and kinda mushy. The fries were also prettty meh.   It may not have the same hipster cache, but you'll get a far better burger at any Harveys/Licks."}
{"text":"I have had FGB a few times now. Two at the one by Ikea and one at MacLeod.  I am giving them a two out of five not because their burger a good but a fries burger and drink costs  $20.  I can get an great tasting thick Angus burger at most higher end restaurants for nearly the same.  But the staff are nice. Free toppings for your burger and one fries feeds two big guys.  I guess their reputation is what sells and that's also included in the price.  This particular locations staff is not as fun as the Ikea crowd who are very entertaining."}
{"text":"A post-mortem:         From my knowledge this was the first 5Guys to open in Quebec if not in all of Canada, but not the first franchise I tried, that would be somewhere in Colorado then Rochester, New York back in 2011 before trying the West Island branch in D.D.O several months later. The Vaudreuil spot proved disappointing more often than not.         One visit around 5pm on a Saturday while placing my order I was informed they had no more bacon..what?? At least I could have tomato as a condiment, not so for the poor chap who was behind me, no more tomato for him!! Now I am not sure what supply protocols were in place or enforced but with at least 2 grocery stores within a 5 minute walk, suffice to say this was inexcusably poor management at its best when you have at least 5 more hours left of your business day.     My last visit was last spring and yet another disappointment when I witnessed the cook pressing down on my burgers!!! In true cook form, this procedure is pure sacrilege pressing out all that precious moisture!! I am paying a princely sum for my burger and am in no rush, I will wait for it to be cooked properly. I called them out on this issue to which \"standard procedure\" excuse was provided.  Absolute folly I say!! As a result my burger was not as juicy as were previously enjoyed.     We may never know what lead to the closing, but from my few disappointments if these or other anomalies happened more often then the picture is more clear. But this is not the first branch to close in Quebec that I am aware, Vimont, Laval and the gay village in Montreal have closed within the past year may be a trend? I will still go to where I can enjoy these burgers as long as time and availability permits."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite burger place in all of Vaughan. The staff was incredibly nice and prepared a bomb a** burger. This place actually knows what spicy means!! Unfortunately, the fries had way too much salt on them but I will be coming back and giving the fries another try.. And of course the burgers!"}
{"text":"So I've never been a big fan of Five Guys, because their burgers seemed way to heavy and greasy. However, its been a long time since my visit so it's only fair if we gave this another go.  This time I had a regular cheeseburger. That's it. And I am happy to admit its a decent burger. I got the works minus mayo and besides the tomato being a little under ripe and it taking a tad longer than I would like to ready my small order, I really enjoyed the burger. There are a number of places I would place ahead of 5G's as the king of burgers in their weight-class. But they are a decent option."}
{"text":"So all the ranting and raving worked..because it planted the seed in my intestine and every time I passed this lame-OH mall, I wanted to make a visit to this place.   So I did.  This kids, is the story about the time I met your future \"that burger\" review.   It started after a hard days work - as per my usual days. I tossed and twiddled in my seat for something new. Something Juicy and fatty and bad for you and virginal to my tasting knowledge. My best bud - coinkidinkly also had the same craving -hence why we are best buds. he suggested \"hey, what about that place\"  to which I replied \" Ooooohhh, yes , THAT place\".   So off we went into that place. Facing the opposite end of the mall, it helped swat away all the lame-OH's that visit this mall. Plus, the parking lot is big enough to do donuts. You see kids, the funny part about this trip was my battery was going through some meth withdrawal so I had to keep the car running (why? I usually end up writing essays that put English buffs into antiphelectic shock but I have to catch up on my reviews so perhaps ask a car person to explain this to you). So, with that in mind... I left my bud in the car and walked into this place.  tings I noticed :  Odd shape of restaurant.   no combo *gasp* - what the blasphemous antiseptic firewall??  Fires are extra - repeat above. W.T.B.A.F - (this will become a thing, you read it here first). chairs and tables galore - a little too sure, are we?  No female staff members - interesting  So I gots my burger and got fries on the side (with Cajun powder in a separate container)  The burger was slimy.  Not necessarily in a bad way but just, everything was melted. I ate it anyway. It wasn't bad, just not the BEST in town. The cashier was nice enough to not charge me with fries so I enjoyed them rather more. ^_^  The Cajun powder on the side was just weird. It's like someone giving me oil on the side - for my rice. Really really weird.   Listen FIVE guys, I get your trying to follow the GaGa era and be \"different\" but if your going to take a north American classic - keep it that way. Classic.   No deal. Don't waste your money.  I would tap it again - if I happen to be in the area and won pro line for $120.00  p.s what is with the potato sacks laying around. How \"different\" does someone have to be to consider them as decoration?  xoxo M."}
{"text":"They are really good, but you have to take burger out of wrap right after you get it so bun does get soggy. It would be nice if they toasted or grilled buns.   Place was always full and the staff always busy but organized in their stations.  Fries are great too! Oh, funny thing is, you have a choice of regular or large drink... AND free refills :P why go big if you have refills"}
{"text":"Although pricey, you get pretty much what you pay for in terms of getting the value for your buck. It is definitely refreshing to see an establishment that has not succumbed to 'micro transactions' in their menu and lays out what it has to offer at a fixed price with no grey areas in between. Five Guys offers a plethora of condiments that you can get with your burger, from your classic lettuce and tomatoes to grilled onions and mushrooms. Besides the burgers, the fries are something else. They literally dump an extra scoop fries into your bag on top of the regular portion served in the typical paper cup; talk about value! It's also nice that they offer peanuts on the side as a complimentary snack as you wait for your burger. With other establishments, you sometimes walk out salivating for more, but it definitely wasn't the case when I was done with my burger and fries."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a quick bite eat for my birthday.  I have been wanting to try this place out since it opened earlier this year.  There was tremendous amount of hype about their burgers.  Unfortunately, they DID NOT live up to the hype.  We order three little hamburger, one regular cheeseburger (2 patties), large cajun fries and a large drink (free refills).  The burgers were ok, I have had better at Hero Burger or Craft Burger (now known as Smoke's). You can pick your toppings on each burger, the downside is that your burger falls apart.  The double patty burger had to eaten with a knife and fork.    The cajun fries were pretty good, for a large it feed the four of us and we still had some leftover fries that we could not finish.    Free refills on the drinks was an added bonus.  We took advantage of it as a family.  If you are keen on trying this place, go ahead.  You will soon realize that it not worth the value for money."}
{"text":"The Line up goes fast which gives you time still to study the numerous toppings to put on your burger.  The little burger is a single patty and the regular burger is a double, the large fries as told would serve 5 people, order the small drink as refills are free. There are boxes of peanuts out front to snack on while you wait for your order.  I wasnt a big fan of the cajun fries but if they were to ever offer  Chili on thier fries would be a big bonus. Decent food, will be back."}
{"text":"Five guys, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you I hate you. Sorry everyone.  I hate five guys for a variety of reasons. Firstly if you order a cheese burger, prepare for the most grotesque perversion of cheese ever. It made me gag, and almost vomit, I had to scrape it off to continue (I'm not even being dramatic).  Next, was the meat. I understand five guys only cooks to well done. It's obvious, all three times I went (hoping it would improve) the burgers were terribly dry, and lacked any memorable flavor. Nothing special about the bun either. A friend of mine really hyped this place up so I was really excited. To answer the obvious question, yes, I now think much less of him as a person.  The fries. Greasy nonsense. Way too many. The amount they give is just silly, total waste of food. A regular person could finish 1/3 of what they give you, tops.   The cost is really stupid too. A cheeseburger combo is 16 bucks. You can eat a burger at the keg with a nice side and a drink for 14... what is 5 guys thinking. Totally overpriced for food that isn't good, at all.... that cheese...   The reason why I gave Five guys 2 stars instead of 1 is because I have a kind heart, and understand that they are very sensitive. But seriously don't believe the hype, it's nothing even remotely special."}
{"text":"The burgers were very good. So was the BLT. The regular fries were boring, the cajun ones were better. The seats of adjacent tables were a bit too close to each other."}
{"text":"All I can say it was amazing, the taste bugs were tingling and wanted more. The burgers are great they are fresh and not frozen also all beef. The fries can come with Cajun spice one it (highly recommended!).  While you wait they offer free peanuts, free is always great. Price is reasonable and quantity is great. the little fries on the menu is like jumbo fries as they top it up.  Watch out: not a place for peanut allergy folks as there are peanuts in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Consistently GREAT burgers and fries for v. reasonable prices.  I come here often, even though out of the way, b/c five guys loads your burgers with veg. as you can customize your order, not a sad sliver of day old lettuce and a piece of tomato like a lot of other joints I've been to.  Front staff have always been v. friendly at this location."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place. The walls at FG are plastered in praise from various newspapers and critics in the states, but even has good words from Medicine Hat, Alberta.   The menu is something like a regular burger, which has 2 patties, and the \"little\" ones, with one. The cashier pointed to a picture of a rather big burger on the wall and made it seem like that's the size of their patties but it's not. It's small, even by my standards (and I'm usually satisfied with 4 ounce ones).   Together the bill for 2 people with a single little burger and little bacon cheeseburger, sharing a large pop and large fries, came to just over $20 (!!!). This is probably because everything is \"a la carte\", i.e. no combos.  Got drinks while waiting, and the pop machine didn't work for the coca-cola. :(   The burger itself: as advertised on the sign, it's very well done. But there's NO juice oozing out of the burger, and the patty just looks sad.  The bun was really chewy, which I can't say I liked.  Maybe someone else would, but I don't know why a burger bun would be that dense.   Fries were freshly made, but somehow managed to not be that great.  The \"cajun fries\" is what you'd expect to get from New York Fries, except here they put the seasoning on for you and put a TON of it on. So if you're concerned, either ask for less seasoning to begin with (can always top up), or go with the regular...   The service were good though, friendly staff, fairly clean (well, most of the tables were covered in crumbs, but I was there near closing so I guess that's normal).   Anyway, overall, for this price, this isn't a place I'd go to regularly, and if I'm pretty much paying gourmet burger prices, I'd rather pay up for some of the better joints out there. I feel like I got food that was slightly better than your typical \"fast food\" but at a price that didn't match up to the value you got."}
{"text":"I was here about a month ago on a Wednesday night for dinner. I tried to go on a couple of other occasions, but it was on the weekend for lunch. It was way too busy and nowhere to sit. In my opinion the burgers aren't anything out of the ordinary. If anything, I noticed they were greasy.The french fries are good, and are fried in peanut oil. I went with two adults and two kids and ended up spending close to thirty dollars for hamburgers. To tell you the truth, the burgers at South St. Burgers in CrossIron Mills are much better. they have way more toppings ie; mango chutney, garlic mayo, gourmet relish etc."}
{"text":"I finally made it to 5 Guys today.  At 2:45 pm on a Saturday it was PACKED.  Thankfully it didn't take long to get a table.  The ordering process was quick and easy.  We got our number and sat down to wait.  Lots of people stood at the counter to wait but it's much easier to sit and wait.    As for the food.  The burgers were fresh and tasty.  I had a bacon cheese small burger (which was huge), my husband had a bacon burger and my son had a grill cheese.  We shared a small order of fries.  All the food was good and the fries were fresh cut and tasty.  The cheese on the burgers and the grill cheese is definitely processed.  I don't mind that but some do.  Overall I was happy with the food but I didn't find it that much better than Fatburger.  The fact that Fatburger has onion rings means that we will most likely go there in the future instead of 5 Guys."}
{"text":"I went to Five Guys for my first time last Saturday night, just before closing.  What an awesome experience!  Great service; amazing fries; fantastic burgers, and drinks with free refills  The prices seemed fair.  A little higher than, say McDonalds's, but well worth it.  We had one cheeseburger; one double cheeseburger with bacon; a drink and a large thing of cajun fries.  Everything came out to $23, which I felt was reasonable.  I look forward to going there again!"}
{"text":"Ah, 5 Guys - where have you been all my life.  I have never paid so much for a burger/fry/drink combo and come away feeling it was worth it.  The amount of food you get is ridiculous, the regular fries alone fills nearly 2/3s of a dinner plate. Add to that the fact the the burgers are juicy, flavourful and allow you to design your own toppings. Other fast food chains really need to watch out.  I have tried them all, even lesser know ones like Fat Burger and In & Out and 5 Guys beats them hands down. Best chain burger & fries I have found."}
{"text":"I stop by here every now and then and their burgers are pretty good. Depending on the toppings you get (they are all free), the burger can get quite messy. Nbd, bc you're too busy enjoying the burger to care lol  Always a staple to get their Cajun fries along with the burger! They always overfill it, so that's a plus.  Last, but not least the staff here are very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best burger places I know of.  They have a bunch of locations all over the area, so if you are near one definitly check them out.  My first experience with the Five Guys was at this one in Gastonia.    The friend I was with warned me not to get fries unless I was really hungry.  I, of course decided that if I ordered a small I would end up with the perfect amount.  To my surprise and dismay a small order of fries still took up half the bag. I couldn't even see my burger it was buried under so many fries.  They were good, but there were so many I couldn't finish them all.    The burgers themselves are fantastic.  I love how you can personalize them and put only what you want on them.  They are big and thick and messy, just the way I like them."}
{"text":"Consistently good burgers and fries.  Service is great; the employees actually don't seem to hate working there.  The grilled vegetable sandwich is my go-to; even though it's basically grilled toppings, it's still delicious.  And I appreciate the lack of fake meat.    Note that although the menu doesn't specify, the regular Cheeseburger is actually a double patty."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch pick up near work and found the most wonderful people working here. If you are the owner or manager reading this, everyone there on 3/27 at noon deserves a big raise!"}
{"text":"In the realm of \"fast food burgers\" Calgary has always been a bit lacking.  For years I have been desperate to drink the Peter's Drive Inn Kool Aid and find unadulterated joy in their paltry little pucks of beef, but I can't.  What I wanted was an Calgary equivalent of Toronto's Lick's Burger.  Hold your gasps and sputtering rage, my dear Calgary pals; it isn't that I didn't believe fine fast and fresh burgers couldn't be made at this altitude--only in the Holy of Holies Toronto--no no!  It's just that it hadn't happened yet. Five Guys--a Yank chain--made its way north, and I'm glad for it.  An incredibly focused menu (want a burger?  fries? you're set.  anything else, and you're hooped) doesn't bother me--but I do work for a company that only makes ONE style of beer, so I'm part of the faithful who say that doing one thing really, really well is to be celebrated rather than poked at.  They do, however, offer nearly everything under the sun when it comes to dressing those burgers--including freshly sliced jalapeños--all for the price of admission (so go nuts, if you fancy)!  When I say fast, I mean \"As fast as can be expected for fresh made to order burgers\"--so expect to wait 5 minutes for your grub; but your wait will be rewarded with a double stack of beef patties and some terrific fresh cut fries given the hot seat in peanut oil, which gives them a nice subtle flavour naturally. The joint is a bit pricy--but I'd be willing to pay more if the experience stays consistent.  I pay way more at Buchanan's Chophouse for their burger--the high water mark for burgers in Calgary--so for a quick fix on the run I find 5 Guys reasonable. Why are you reading this?  Get gone to Deerfoot Meadows."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times.  The food is what it is - really great fast food burgers and fries.  Far better than any other fast food chain at a similar price point.  I usually get the bacon cheeseburger \"all the way\" with jalapenos - mmm!!!  My only complaint is that there are sometimes VERY long wait times at this location.  I think I waited for 20 minutes one time."}
{"text":"At my old job, I remembered everyone was making a lot of noise about this place and I wanted to try it for myself.  I finally got the chance the other day. Big barrels of shelled peanuts out in the open, hmmm isn't that just adorbs! Lol, didn't quite walk to the counter, I was busy reading the wall and trying to decide what I wanted.  End up getting a plain jr. cheeseburger and some fries. The girl taking my order wasn't to \"friendly\" but whatever lol.  Walked over to the tables to wait for my order and noticed that they had something on the wall stating what the potato they were using that day...awwww.  When I got my order, the bag was already soaked with grease (is that a sign of it being really really good or just bad lol).  They give you a nice huge portion of fries.  So the fries was taste tested first...meh nicely seasoned but whatever potatoes that was used didn't taste good.  I thought a little ketchup would help but nope...still not yummy.  As far as the burger goes...so how about those Browns? Lol, wasn't impressed at all, didn't really know what to expect-maybe for the flavor to melt in my mouth while floating in the air, lol I don't know.  But don't really understand what the big rave is all about at this place.  Service was meh, food was meh...meh meh meh lol. Yes I am TRIPPING! :p"}
{"text":"How couldn't you love Five Guys if you like burgers and fries? It doesn't matter where we are at, we've had Five Guys from Key West to Myrtle Beach and Savannah, we always have a good experience. Their food is just spot on every time!   We love this location because it is close to our house and the people are very friendly. We can order online on the way home and they have it ready when we get there. The app is very easy to use for online ordering and remembers what you order most often.   If in the area and want a good fast food experience please drop by."}
{"text":"Dear Five Guys,   See it's like this...I have this special place in my heart for jalapenos. It's like my \"thing\". And you guys...well you... serve them FRESH and it kinda blows my mind.   Whether it's a hot dog or burger you pile them up and it just makes my heart SO happy. Like the kind of happy that makes me want to always be around you and make sure tell everyone just how awesome you are...like all the time.  And I don't want to freak you out but....well...there's more....see you also serve your fries HOT and dripping with grease in a cup spilling over into a brown bag...and I just have to try and eat them. ALL of them. Because...Well, let's face it they are just too good to go to waste. And I just can't share...NO! I mean if anyone's fingers try to come near my bag they better be prepared for battle. Yeah. It's that serious.   So I just want to thank you for being so freaking awesome. And let you know that even though I may be a bit bias but I don't care. Keep doing what you are doing.   And I promise to keep raving about your awesome-ness to anyone that will listen!   Sincerely,   Candyce \"Jalapeno Lover\" B"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I ordered a cheeseburger with onions, lettuce, mayo & ketchup. I also got an order of french fries. It was so delicious, they seriously have the BEST burgers on the planet. The take out man on the phone was also very friendly. I definitely recommend this place to anyone, very good!!"}
{"text":"I had the regular cheeseburger (with everything plus relish), regular fries, and regular pop (always bottomless here). Total about $13.  The burger patty itself was as juicy and delicious as a homemade burger. Also, a \"regular\" burger here is actually two patties on top of each other. But what made the burger truly a cut above the rest (in Calgary at least) was the generous and fresh-tasting toppings: onions, mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, mayo, relish, all piled on to the burger so that it could barely fit between the buns. It was actually hard to get a complete bite of the burger all at once. It was kind of messy (this is not a first date destination) but who cares? The fries were also very good - I love it when they leave the skin on the potatoes.   Be warned that the regular burger and the regular fries are probably a bit too much food for the average person (unless you haven't eaten all day) because the regular burger is actually two patties and when they give you the bag with your order they pour more fries on top of everything in the bag so you get what would be the equivalent of an XXL order of fries at most other fast-food places.  The only reason I gave this place four stars instead of five is because I'm saving the five-star rating for when Shake Shack makes it to Calgary from NYC."}
{"text":"New burger spot by work so I had to check it out.  Feels like every other new burger joint.  Clean, quick, friendly, and painless.  Order in line, sit down, and wait for your number.  No combos or value meals but they do offer free peanuts while you wait.    I opted for a cheeseburger and regular fries.    The food came out in a brown bag.  I opened it up and could only see this massive pile of fries.  Must have been two or three potatos worth.  I finally eat my way down to the burger and pull it out.  It is also pretty massive.  There are tons of different toppings you can choose from for free: onions, mushrooms, jalapenos, green chile, A1 sauce, and pleanty more.  They were generous with the toppings and the patties were pretty huge.  The burger tasted fresh and almost homemade.  The fries looked and tasted homemade as well.  Thick cut with the skin still on.  Everything tasted like real food not your regular fast food but you get what you pay for.  The bad part was it was just too much.  I hate wasting food and threw out almost the entire cup of fries.  There is seriously enough to share for three grown men.  I can't imagine what the large looks like.  There was also too much salt for me.  It was over 10 bucks for a burger and fries.  This isn't very excessive compared to a lot of the new and improved burger shops but you are paying for the better quality.  While this is the norm I think it is also too much for one person.  I seriously kept thinking there were enough fries for a small family and wish I could have had a smaller option.  Next time I visit I will only get fries if I have a friend or two to share them with.  I will also ask for no salt.  Instead of a regular sized burger I will ask for the little cheeseburger.  I definitely feel Five Guys can hang with Smashburger, Culvers, Habit or any other new higher end burger joint.    The real question is do I really need to try every new burger shop that pops up??"}
{"text":"Besides Jack Asters, five guys is my other favourite place for a burger & fries combo .. Love how they overflow your fries.. One large fries is more than enough to fill 2 people.. Only thing I don't like is how sometimes it takes to long to get your food even when it's dead but the taste of the food makes up for it. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"LOVE it!  As far as fast-food goes, this is tops! The burgers are amazing, big, juicy and SO FLAVOURFUL!  I am not even a huge fan of burgers but once in a while you just get a craving, y'know what I mean right? And Five Guys satisfies! It's not gourmet by any means, but gosh darn it's delicious!   The decor is cute, diner-style, the service is super quick, all the toppings are FREE, and believe it or not, its the place to see and be seen. Yup, the Major and I rubbed shoulders and exchanged unspoken nods at this location, cuz ya know, you gotta give props to a fellow citizen with good taste when you see one!"}
{"text":"Comparing with other \"Five Guys\" locations, this particular location, in Ballantyne, is average.  As one would expect from any Five Guys, you get a good burger and a heaping load of fries in a brown bag, no shocker there.  However, for the unique orders, they tend to mess-up on and the customer service fluctuates from good to meh.  Since I only been here during lunch time, they do get busy, but generally still good turnaround serving your food (which yes, they shout your number).  The peanuts are not always fresh (gummy taste).    Typically, if I have a choice, I would drive a little further to the Five Guys at the Blakeney Shopping Center, they are a better location.  Be careful how you park in the parking lot, the spaces are narrow!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Five Guys Burgers was in the states.  And I thought, holy molly their burger is heavy (as in weight)!   Hahaha since it was my first time, I didn't know any better and I ordered a regular cheeseburger with \"all the way\" (So they have options for your toppings - \"All the Way\" which is all the toppings they listed or you can \"pick and choose\".  And of course to top it all, all the toppings are FREE, no extra cost whatsoever), regular fries and one drink.  As you wait for your order, you can enjoy the free peanuts they provided in the restaurant.  It's pretty good since it does help to pass time, not that the wait for your order was long.  It just gives you and your friends something to do.  Anyway, when I got my order I thought to myself \"what the heck did I order?  It's so damn heavy...it's like a 3 pounders!!\".  There were tons of fries and the burger is huge.  It was a little taste of heaven.  The patty is juicy with overloaded toppings.  As far as I know, this is the best burger I have ever had!  I enjoyed every single bite of the burger.  It was sooooo delicious.    Yup when I found out there's one opened up in Calgary I was so excited!  Of course I wen to check it out.  There was a long line up when I went at lunch time but the good thing is that they are pretty quick.  This time I ordered the LITTLE bacon cheeseburger with all the toppings.....well, the burger is not little....but it was still heavy and big.  I think their little burger is bigger than the big Mac.  This time I ordered the Cajun fries (oh yeah it's a MUST try.  It is very good.)    Overall, I love Five Guys and definitely going back regularly (as in once a month...gotta watch the calories).  Seriously though, after having burger from Five Guys, I feel like I have to run 10K just to burn off all the fat I have digested.  So the cons for Five Guys in my opinion is that the burger is too delicious and you cannot help but to eat it and then force yourself to exercise vigorously, that way you can have as much as you want."}
{"text":"The burgers were so good and juicey and the fries were just fantastic. I couldn't finish evrything as there was so much. A little pricey at over $11 for a burger, fries and a soda. But just the best burger I've had in quite a long time."}
{"text":"Really great burgers but a little bit expensive. It cost us $27 for two of us having burgers, fries, and drinks. Two of us did not finish one large order of cajun fries."}
{"text":"Fries are great... the rest of the menu not so great.  Basically, if you don't eat hamburgers or hotdogs, your only option for protein is a grilled cheese sandwich.   Now, I grew up eating grilled cheese sandwiches & it was one of my fav comfort foods that my dad would make for me (not sure why, but I don't remember my mom making it).    But in any case, the 5 Guys grilled cheese is nothing special.   They really need to do something to give it a little pizzazz, otherwise, even though they have great fries, I don't have any compelling reason to go back."}
{"text":"THE BEST FRIES ANYWHERE &  a huge portion. Burger is nothing more than average. Pricey for what you get except the fries. Hot dog is a good option as it is quite good and less money then a burger. Peanuts are great addition."}
{"text":"Really good burgers! Better than lots of burger joint. No chewie meat like Boardwalk or St south...  Fries are okay. Not the best for me but tastes to discuss...  Con: Too bright and lit white and red ambiance.  Could have the coolness of a fatburger. At least thr are better burger than fatburger  Other con: No onions rings. :("}
{"text":"HUGE burgers!! And one small fry is enough to feed my family of three.  Very tasty food and good solid service.  Very yummy!  I dont think the Yelp map is exactly correct though. but I guess close enough."}
{"text":"Picked up an online order from here about 15 minutes before they closed, and they gave us the rest of the fries they had cooked up, which I thought was nice. Their burgers have always been great and consistent. The only thing I didn't like was that all the fries were kind of soggy, but maybe I just got a bad batch because they were the end-of-day fries lol"}
{"text":"A pretty high price point for a burger joint, but well worth it to me. Highly recommend the Cajun Fries. Also, don't make the mistake of ordering the Cheeseburger because it comes with two patties, unless thats what you want. I've learned from this, and have ordered the Mini Cheeseburger ever since. I like that you can order all the toppings you want at the cash. I thought It was so cool that there was free peanuts, Its makes the lining up fun and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Yummy. Best burgers in cowtown. Won't go to fat burger or south company now that Five Guys is open in Airdrie"}
{"text":"I had originally had this in the States. I was ecstatic to find out that it had come into Canada.   The burgers are fresh and made to order, non of that hot-tray crap. They give you a generous portion and is a fair price. The prices are much more affordable than Fat Burger - and I'd say even better.   Love this place and go when I can.  One note though... GO HUNGRY!!"}
{"text":"I like Five Guys a lot, but the attitude tonight was not what I needed.  I ordered online, it said ready in 7 minutes which is unheard of if you've actually ever ordered in-store before. But I figured I would test it out and leave asap.  Arrive there about 10 minutes later, go to the pick up section, like it says online, and told the guy there calling out number 21 I had a web order. Then, about 10 minutes later, the bleached-blonde girl with glasses asks me if I had a web order. I said yes, and she laughs and says, \"Well you gotta let us know.\"  HELLO, MR. STONER OVER THERE IN THE CORNER WAS TOLD, HE PROBABLY JUST FORGOT ON ACCOUNT OF HOW HIGH HE IS.  I said nicely, \"Hey I told that guy over there, so I don't know what else I'm supposed to say.\"  I smiled and laughed too, just like she did, as she apologized and handed me my burger.  Next time I expect better, Five Guys."}
{"text":"This is my fav burger joint.  Pricey but worth it.  I usually get the cheeseburger loaded.  The fries are excellent.  A very cool place.  Very good beef."}
{"text":"My go to joint for when I want a real burger. The food is excellent. You can watch your order being made, or sit down and enjoy some free peanuts while you wait. There is a sign on the wall from where they source their potatoes -  It's great to see Canadian sourced potatoes being used. Their service is great - I've been greeted numerous times when I enter and leave.   I come back often to this location, as their is ample parking, and seating inside the restaurant. Their facilities are clean, and maintained.   If you haven't been to five guys, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Ya f*ck this place.  Everyone knows, EVERYONE knows that when you cook meat well done, let alone very well done as they do at Five Guys, you pretty much kill any flavour leaving it dry and tasteless.  This place has NOTHING on Burger's Priest.  Burger's Priest is without a doubt THE BEST burger joint in the GTA.  So take a look at their secret menu on facebook and take the trip to Queen St East & Coxwell - its mos def worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but overall its not worth the price. You get a lot more bang for your buck at those mom and pop shops than this place. Plus its greasy as hell! When they gave my food it was so greasy that it had to spill onto the bag which was holding it. It had so much grease it felt bad that it had so much and decided to spread it around like Oprah winfrey gives gifts away. That sight made me ask the person working there if the meal came with a triple bypass."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Overall experience: 3/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  Did I miss something when I took my first bite from one of Five Guys hamburger? I heard many good things from this burger and fries joint but I was slightly disappointed. I thought I was going to bite into this mind blowing, oh my god I'm gonna have an orgasm burger. Alas, that did not happen haha... No doubt about it I praise this place for ultimate freshness (thumbs up all the way). They make their own beef patties and hand cut their fries which are deep fried in peanut oil. My bf and I ordered a regular 'hamburger' which is two patties (about the diameter of a cup) stacked on top of each other for $6.49 each and goes up by a dollar for a cheeseburger or bacon burger. The cheapest burger on their menu is their 'little hamburger' which I assume is just one patty for only $5.00. This is a tad pricey for a burger to me, but I guess this is what you get for freshness.   You have a choice of any free toppings which include: mayo, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, jalapeno peppers (freshly cut), green peppers, A.1 sauce, bbq sauce, or hot sauce. We also got a large fries for $4.59 which was enough to feed two people. They also have a choice in sandwiches such as the veggie sandwich, cheese veggie or grilled cheese for under $4.00.   Fries were hot and tasty (nothing too special) and the burger was pretty massive; I had troubles fitting the entire thing in my mouth. Have a ton of napkins ready especially if you decided to add sauce and half the toppings on the list. It can be quite messy eating it. I liked the grilled mushrooms as it had a sweet yet smokey flavor to it. The beef itself was a tad bland and the juices were no longer there since they squish each patty down on the grill which is a definite *no no* if you want to keep in the juices. Overall, you can definitely taste the freshness in their ingredients but It tastes like a regular hamburger to me that I could make equally as well (maybe better) and for cheaper at home.   I came here on a Saturday at 2:00pm and you would think the place would die down. However, when I walked in all I could see were filled tables and a lineup with about 10 or so people ahead of me. There is a old school diner feel to it with a red, white, and black colour scheme and an open kitchen with people yelling out orders, dressed in their red aprons. There are stacks of potato sacks and peanut oil in the middle of the room, and giant signs of rave comments and reviews posted up on the wall. While you're waiting you can also grab some free peanuts so I found it kind of disgusting to see peanut shells all over the floor. On a busy day we waited about 20 minutes to order and wait for our order to be made.  I recommend a visit for the novelty and for a taste of fresh burgers (which is lacking in the fast food business) but there is nothing  super special with the flavors of their burgers."}
{"text":"Always our favorite burger spot. We have 2 of these near where we live but this is the accessible one. Love how simple their menu is and how flavorful the patty tastes even without the veggies you mix. Although this location didn't have the milkshakes yet when we were there 2 weeks ago."}
{"text":"I would give it a five star , food is always fresh and warm , there bacon burger always a treat ,lots of fries ,the only downside is the price ,but for a few buck more it way better than any mcdo"}
{"text":"After a recent trip to Fatburger I was left quite disappointed, my sister was amazed I hadn't switched over to Five Guys.   OMFG. This place is great. An amazing burger, fries and drink. Sure there can be a wait but I'm thoroughly pleased with the service and quality of food. It's comparable to in-n-out - I'm really not sure which one I like better... I do like the Cajun fries better here.   So if you haven't been, and you're in the south, you need to check this place out. We can't all always drive out to Peters (and yes I think this place is much better than Peters).   PS. A large fries are huuuuuuuge.   PPS. My favourite type of burger is the bacon cheese burger with grilled mushrooms, onions and bbq sauce. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"I will never buy a Five Guys burger again.  It was a really let down after having so many times enjoyed their partner, Blaze Pizza. I had thought that Smash Burger was rather bland and boring, but Five Guys easily beats them out for just kinda ... I don't know.   The burger has next to no flavour - what kind of meat is it really? - and there are hardly any condiments to add to it to overcome the lack of taste in the meat. This is a poor burger, but it certainly looks okay and IS edible.  What kinda gets to me is that it seems that most people don't know what a truly great burger is, and in so not knowing, we get used to something that's not good, but for a lack of a benchmark or a true representation of things, we settle for the mediocre and call it good.   Without any input from the guest, the fries are simply too salty for some people (esp. with hbp), yet are quite good as a sidekick, but the burgers are the feature, are they not?  I also tried their milkshakes, and well, what unimpressive flavor and size, for a huge price. They try to spice them up, but the recommended switch-it-up flavors of chocolate with caramel was not all that good, and the 'whipped cream' was that aerosol junk that leaves a scum on the back of the tongue.   So what do you really get?  Decent free pre-salted un-shelled peanuts.  So do we drop in for the peanuts and leave?  Or maybe go next door, and bring back a Blaze pizza to go with the peanuts. Now there's an idea..."}
{"text":"I've got to say: I was underwhelmed by my last visit to Five Guys. Granted, I was there just before New Years when the whole Deerfoot Meadows area is still packed with \"Boxing Week\" shoppers. However, it wasn't the busyness that bothered me; it was the lack of cleanliness. I know you're busy but how hard would it be to go around wiping down the tables once in awhile? How about sweeping? Dirty restaurants like this gross me out and don't exactly invite a return visit.  That being said, the food was as good as other reviews on here rave. Tip to my fellow vegetarians: skip the veggie sandwich and opt for the grilled cheese with all the fixings. It's much more satisfying.  If I'm hungry and in the area again I would probably stop by and give the restaurant a second chance thanks to the quality of the food. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt for now that the messiness was due to the time of year and is not standard practice. I hope I'm not wrong."}
{"text":"So this is Five Guys. It's a burger chain that cooks with peanut oil. That's their thing. Each one offers complimentary peanuts while you wait. The burgers are good and well caloried, yeah I just said caloried. That's usually all I ever get when I come here. They serve the burger in an old-fashioned way which is wrapped in foil in a brown paper bag nestled atop the abundant amount of french fries. Probably not the best for to-go orders as the grease from the fries ruins paper.(See Christine D.'s review) If you just aren't in the mood for a Big Mac or Whopper, go here. Then to the gym."}
{"text":"First ever visit to this chain. A recent poll had it usurping In 'N Out as the favourite burger chain, just not in my opinion.   The portions are ridiculously huge. The burger is offered with everything but the kitchen sink for toppings and if you choose most of the toppings, the bun can't handle it. Even given the limitations of the bun, the burgers were tasty. I found the fries to be excessively salty and the two of us could only eat about 1/2 a regular size.   Not sure what the boxes of peanuts laying around were all about. It is nice to offer your customers a complimentary snack, but a food item that so many people have severe allergic reactions to is kind of goofy. I didn't see EpiPens on the menu!"}
{"text":"I had to check out this place. I had always heard how great the food was  and I was not disappointed.  I made sure I was there when they opened as it was Saturday. I got there at 1106 and was shocked to see that approx 1/3 of the restaurant was full already. By the time I left there at 1140 it was almost full.  I didnt expect it to be that busy, but good for them.    Make no mistake, this experience is intense. There were 17 staff working behind one massive open kitchen line.. The staff are shouting all kinds of stuff at full volume, I kept hearing them announce everytime someone comes in  \"three in the door!\"  \"two in the door!!!\" then someone will shout  \"GOT IT!\". It was quite crazy. When they're busy I imagine it is not that strange...if this place ever isnt busy  ( hard to believe) it would border on hysterical.  So I get to the counter, and was greeted by a cheerful girl, who was polite and sweet and loud too. She screamed my order to the grill like a hellcat in heat.  I did find it fun though.  I ordered the little burger ( which was still HUGE) Little means one patty only.  It was loaded with all the stuff I wanted, and good quality toppings too.  I ordered Cajun fries ( regular size, which were so huge I could only finish a quarter of them), and a drink.  Order a regular, there are free refills. You fill your own cup and they encourage you to refill them. There is a big sign on the dispenser shouting  FREE REFILLS!! Even the signs shout here.   The burger was truly delicious, like the best homemade on he barbeque kind. The fries were also fantastic, meaty chips with cajun seasoning ( not salt).  They have huge ketchup pumps up front so you can grab your heinz, and also peanuts with little trays you can help yourself too while you wait for your cooked to order meal.  A family of four came in and sat near me, and the little girl had what looked like the BEST grilled cheese I had ever seen. I am going to order that next time I am in, it looked that good.  Summing up... Great food, FAST service ( considering the fresh cooked quality) High energy place where they focus on doing a few things, very, very, very well.  Fatburger next door may be a tad scared. Five guys is seriously awesome."}
{"text":"I tried a Five Guys when they first came to town a couple years ago, and wasn't all that impressed. I don't know if they changed, or if I did, or if this location is different, but I really enjoyed my meal this time.  It's still way overpriced - $13+ for a fast food bacon cheeseburger, small fries, and small drink. But I chose to ignore the price and just focus on he food. And it was damn good.  The burger was flavorful, with delicious bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, and A-1 sauce. The Cajun fries were tasty, but maybe could have used an extra 30 seconds in the fryer.  I'll keep this option open from now on - I'd probably still go to Fudd's or Islands when I want to spend this much for a burger, but when it's more convenient to go here, I'm sure I'll find myself back once in a while."}
{"text":"+ + + Free Peanuts while you wait  Seasoned Fries - crisp, seasoned well, large portions  I'm not a burger pro but it was damn tasty and fresh.  I'm not a big bacon fan except on burgers and their bacon is CRISPY. It was crispy from end to end.  It had that nice crunch in every bite!  Still a line up and they've been open for a while now..  I think since November and up until now... still a line up.   That's how you can tell their food is so good!"}
{"text":"Don 't go crazy with your burger loading.  Stuck with maybe three add-ons and enjoy.  Too many toppings = yuck and you won 't be able to taste the great beef.  Quite an experience and the brand is consistent where ever you are located.  Service is accurate and pretty fast.  Lots and LOTS of options and, as I mentioned in my tip, the beef is quality and not what you could get at the local supermarket.  Portions are huge, so if you are a light eater or with children, go for half a burger or less to share with whomever you are with."}
{"text":"The peeps i work with sent me here on a lunch run a few months ago. I barely got the food back in one piece because the grease soaked bags kept ripping.  The burger and fries i had were...well...greasy.  Very greasy. I felt slimy the entire rest of the day. I don't get the obsession some have with their burgers. To each their own but I certainly didn't dig them."}
{"text":"So you are craving a good and juicy burger that has flavor with toppings that pop? And you want fries that are made from potatoes? Oh... you don't mind getting your hands a little bit greasy (After all, that's why napkins were made in the first place, right?)? And you actually want people to take your order and cook for you that are actually happy?  Well then Five Guys is the place for you to try. I can honestly say that if I had the choice to change the menu a little bit, I would, but it would only be to add milkshakes to the mix.  Their burgers here are top notch, with some great toppings that are always fresh. If you like Jalapenos you might really like theirs **warning, they are fresh, and thus they change by the seasons and can be extremely spicy at times**  I also highly recommend their fries, however another warning - If you want fries, order the smaller size, unless you are with a friend or 4. They give you a LOT of fries, but they are extremely good!  Bottom line... Any time I crave a burger, I have two options 1) crank up my grill and make my own or 2) jump in my car and go to Five Guys ( I typically opt for the second option)"}
{"text":"I read the reviews below and agree that the burger preparation kinda gets out of hand. I ordered a cheeseburger with everything on it and when I opened the wrap, it looked like they put in a hand grenade as a fix-in as well. It was difficult to enjoy and they shuld consider using sandwich boxes instead of wraps?  The fries were good and when I ordered a large, they overfilled the container past the brim. A step above new york fries. The service was also OK   I don't usually care about decor, but I did find it a bit pretentious inside. Like seriously why post article quotes and clippings about how great the burgers inside? I'm not all the more convinced that the burger I am consuming is \"THE BEST\"."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Five Guys where ever I'm at... and this one didn't disappoint.  It has to be one of the nicest ones I've ever been to.  The only challenge I had was in finding it as it's behind the shopping center... but then the GPS was ever diligent and got me there just fine.  You will enjoy this location!"}
{"text":"How does a 5 guys close down? Delicious meat and fries by the bushel. All the makings of a successful business. #MissingTheBeef"}
{"text":"I came here because a burger aficionado insisted that Five Guys burger would change my life.  How wrong he was.  I found the burger here sub-par.  The burgers are customizable and made to order.  What puzzled me is that, if they were made to order, why was my burger soggy and the bread dripping? It should taste fresh, the bread should be solid, the meat solid and the toppings crunchy (except for the sauteed onions).  I don't want to eat a soggy burger!!  I came here again with the same Five Guys burger lover and got the same soggy burger (all I put in my burger is ketchup and mayo).  Never again.  I never went back since then.  I don't get it, I just don't get how people like this place.  I guess the peanuts are pretty cool, but I'm not there for peanuts, I'm there for a burger.  I gave it two stars because the staff wasn't rude or anything, and the place is decent, so it did not warrant a one star rating, despite my qualms about their soggy burger."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Hwy 7 and Weston location but good nonetheless, I frequent this location since the drive is more convenient (though same travel time) especially during rush hour  I order a simple burger (ketchup, mustard, mayo, jalapeño) and always enjoy the burger though sometimes this location gives me burnt edges which is a turn off  They also served me the wrong burger on a Football Sunday which really made me mad and slowed my frequency of visits  Staff here is good just like the Hwy 7 location   If you never tried Five Guys you are doing yourself a disservice"}
{"text":"I had five guys twice , first time I had it at this location...it sucks so bad I threw away half the burger and fries were average or below average. Yesterday I decided to give this location and Franchise a second chance and the taste wasn't as awful as the first time, my hamburger was actually hot and slightly juicy but Cajun fries were average at best and cold. Well at least you get free peanuts ."}
{"text":"Five guys is great. Their presentation is lacking but the food is good. If you are in the mood for a burger this is the place to go.  Try to think about what you want on it though before you get to the front of the line. The manager at this particular five guys was really friendly and seemed to actually enjoy working there.  As always there are free peanuts to munch on while you wait for your meal.  To drink they have the regular soft drinks and yea. The fries are great as well, crispy and not too salty.  If you need to get a meal on your own you can sit at a Hightop without feeling like a total loser."}
{"text":"Wow.  I cannot believe some of the poor reviews for this place.  This is the best burger around, bar none.  Bar none.  This place doesn't mess around with gimmicks.  If you want a gimmicky burger, go to Red Robin.  You know why Five Guys don't mess around with gimmicks?  They do not have to hide the taste of their meat.  It tastes like meat.  They don't need to hide it with avocado or pineapples, or other such trendy non-sense.  This is a classic hamburger, and by far the best one you can get in Mississauga of all places.  Someone also mentioned that there were bags of potatoes everywhere.  You know why?  Because they use them to make their fries.  i.e. they serve FRESH cut fries.  You would be hard pressed to find many fast food places that actually do that in house.  And to those who complain about the menu being short; it's called Five Guys BURGERS AND FRIES.  Hasn't anyone heard the expression, \"Jack of all trades, King of none\"?  I would rather go for a place that specializes in hamburgers and get an amazing hamburger, than go to some smorgasbord to get sub-par menu items.  Ignore some of these other reviews.  If you want a good burger and fries, go to Five Guys and thank me afterwards.  Peace."}
{"text":"Bacon Cheese Burger 7.5/10 - Nothing special   Fries 2/10.  If you like bland soggy fries go for it.  McDonald is way better than this..... which is kind of sad.   Soda drinks - flat but free re-fills  8/10  Peanuts - free  10/10   I will only go for the burger.  Avoid the FRIES~!!!!"}
{"text":"Truth be told -- I am not a huge burger fan.  Usually when I go out for something to eat and I am craving a \"burger like\" item, I usually go for a chicken burger.  That's my \"normal\".  However, when my mom was visiting me this summer, I took her to Five Guys Burger and Fries, because SHE loves burgers, and I have read good things about this place from burger lovers.  What shocked me was the lineup!  In my mind, that is a good sign. :)  I figured that if their burgers warranted this kind of popularity, I was not going to be left out.  So I tried their burger with everything on it, and I have to say.... wow!  I see why people eat these things!  First off, I was impressed the thing was cooked.  I know that's a strange thing to say, but one of my biggest issues with buying hamburgers, is simply because I'm looking for it, I often find them pink and not quite cooked.  Five Guys Burgers, thanks for getting the basics right!  Cooked food - check!  This burger was simply the yummiest, messiest thing I have eaten in ages.  With \"the works\" on it, it was a slippery, slide-y, dribble-y, delicious mess.  Even though I had one burger, I looked like I was double fisting, because I had the burger in one hand, and a few stray mushrooms or other random topping in the other, that launched out the back whenever i took a bite.  My ego got the better of me eventually and I let the toppings drop back onto the foil, and then simply picked up a fork.  Thank heavens nobody had a video camera on me.  This is not how I usually eat in public, or private for that matter.  The burger was cooked, but not dry.  Toppings were fresh and good. The staff were friendly and high energy, and the appetizers (peanuts in shells, that you can crack and eat while waiting in line) was a fun surprise.  I will definately go back!"}
{"text":"I apologize if this review is a little scatter-brained, my mind is still twitching from the burger induced mind-gasm this place gave me.  I'm going to attempt to write this review the same way Five Guys treats it's business: keep things short, sweet, simple and effective.  The burgers are among the best I've ever tasted, are made with exactly the toppings you want (no need to worry about employees being so used to 'their way' they forget to hold an ingredient or anything of that nature).  The fries are AMAAAAAZING. I haven't had the cajun style (because the notion somewhere scares me) but nobody in this city does plain old french fries better.  The prices, while higher than your typical big chain fast food places, get you about 3 times the ammount of food you'd expect (if you plan on getting fries, bring a second person to split an order with).  They don't offer a lot of fancy side dish options, they don't do veggie burgers or a million others kinds of meat like some places. They don't have Boogie's impressive milk shake menu (or any, for that matter) or Peters' rich Calgary history... but they don't need ANY of this. They do one thing very, very, VERY (have I said very yet?) well.  If this place were a few blocks closer to the train station, I'd be even happier... but for the sake of my diet, I'm also kind of glad they're not... because I don't have NEARLY the impulse control to walk past Five Guys on a regular basis.  Five Guys, I love you! : D"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh, greasy, backyard barbeque-esque burgers this is the place for you. You have full reign on the toppings you want so you can go overboard if you want. The fries are also freshly prepared but require some salting.  The only major gripe with Five Guys is the price. A typical combo (burger + fries+ drink) can easily cost over $15 so you may not go there regularly."}
{"text":"Yes. i love burgers. This is one of the places here in Charlotte where I truly love eating at. A nice juicy burger with everything on it with green peppers, its awesome. This is one fast food joint where I truly enjoy the taste of a good burger. I'm pretty sure there are a lot of better burgers out there in the world, but for a fast food joint this is a good place.  Nice interior, as all five guys usually are, peanuts are unlimited and fries are plentiful if you order. Have a nice juicy burger here for lunch and go back to work as I do every once and a while."}
{"text":"Now I understand why Obama goes to Five Guys. The burgers are presidential! Loaded with toppings, the burgers are massive, juicy, and delicious.   They joint includes a very American feeling, the only thing missing is the option to order your burger done medium.    I'll be back. ;)"}
{"text":"So many topping choices! I believe they use peanut oil here !!ALLERGEN ALERT!!  Big menu, lots of toppings, lots of sauces! Great prices.  I loved how they've placed tubs of free peanuts by the line where you place your order for enjoyment.   One neat thing Five Guys do is intently scoop one or two additional scoop of fries into your paperbag! Cool right.   Burgers meats, hot dogs, fries, free peanuts are always fresh. This place has sodas/pops chemistry dialedd! This is how it should be!!  Will recommend this place to anybody!"}
{"text":"One Liner: Cajun Fries, Cajun Fries, Cajun Fries!!  Food: (scale of 0-4) 3 I don't even want to know how many calories went into my system. The burger was very good. Even though it's not very often that I would eat a well done burger. I really think it's an insult to the cow who died for my meal. The cooked patties were actually very good. What made the trip really worth it though were the fries. Nicely deep fried potatoes bear the typical flavor of peanut oil. With the cajun powder on the fries, I just couldn't stop eating it. They give you plenty of it too. If you order a small, they fill a small cup full of fries, then they scoop at least another cup full and dump them in your bag. Resist finishing all the fries!!!!   Extras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.5  Service 0.1:   Decor 0.1:   Speed 0.2:   Dessert 0.1: Free peanuts, scoop your own!   Prices 0.1:   My score for this experience is 3.5 stars. It's a tough decision, but I'll move it up to 4."}
{"text":"Gahhhh! Why is Five Guy's so delicious and so close to me. I had been hesitant to try this Five Guys' because everything else in the area is below par but this has to be the exception. I've only heard negative things about the Five Guys' in Brampton, so I waited a long time to try it in Canada as I didn't want to taint the awesome burger experience I had south of the border. I LOVED the burger I had here. Grilled mushrooms and onions and barbeque sauce!!! Yes please. And at no extra charge!  My burger was delicious. I was very pleased with this Five Guys' location!"}
{"text":"We don't need no stinking college here, hippy!  So one day your daddy says sons, \"I have saved up $70G for your college education but I am going to give you a choice: College or start your own Business?\" So what decision do you make? The Five guys said we should take that money and invest in a burger joint. Why didn't I think of that not like the world doesn't have enough of those around.  Luckily for all of us, the Five Guys skipped school so they could make us some of the most delicious homemade burgers and french fries on the planet we know as earth. The prices are a bit higher than most burger joints but the portions are massive. I would suggest going with the mini burger and reg cajun fries. They serve Coke products and have the ever delicious Cherry Coke too!  So don't be a dummy, skip school and give Five Guys a try!"}
{"text":"I have had a lot of burgers in my life and this rates up with the best.the fries are good and the Cajun fries are great. Fast service. You get what you pay for and then some.I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"FYI, this place is now closed.  No idea what happened.  They were removing the stickers on the doors and a sign says permanently closed."}
{"text":"This location is great, friendly, good service and yada yada yada but... I feel writing a review for Five Guys is a little moot at this point, I think the word is out on this chain and it tends to be summed up as follows:  Great burgers. Great fries. Steep prices.  And that's 100% true.   So it's safe to say if you're walking into Five Guys, it's because you have a few extra bucks in your pocket and you're looking for quality.  If that's the case, let me point you to an unexpected and overlooked gem on the Five Guys menu:  THE HOT DOGS.  I don't know what came over me but one day I wandered in to pick up a burger and I saw Hot Dog on the menu and was like \"One please!\".  They are fantastic. They butterfly the hot dog before they grill it, so it gets a bit of char over more of the hot dog area, and it spreads the meat out a bit throughout the bun so it makes a lot of sense from a technical execution, but beyond that, they're just really tasty hot dogs.   I expect nothing less from Five Guys, and again they are a lot more $$ than the (to be fair, pretty good) $2 hot dogs you can get from street vendors, but if you're feeling randy, give them a try.   They're really good. Trust me."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town.  I love getting it with their bacon, mushrooms, and A1 sauce. I feel like its a little pricey but it is worth it.  Way better than McDonald's, that's for sure. Always clean. Service is always on point."}
{"text":"Best burgers and hot dogs in town. Oh did I mention that they pile on the fries as well?  There really is no need to order the large fries, small should do just fine unless you really love fries."}
{"text":"So for the longest time I heard how amazing Five Guys was.  Whenever some one mentioned the place, all I heard was \"ahh, yeah, that place is just amazing!\".  So, based on all these amazing verbal reviews, we decided to eat here.  To my dismay, I was quite disappointed!  My expectations of this place had been talked up like no other, and was quickly shot down when I received nothing more than a double cheeseburger from the likes of Burger King.  Yes, it was pretty good; however, it was no gourmet burger.  I will say that the fries were fantastic.  When ordering I figure I should probably get two fries because we would all eat them; that was a mistake.  Ordering two fries gave me more potato than Idaho produces on a good harvesting year, which left me leaving that place having consumed more fries than what my insides really needed.  Overall we enjoyed the restaurant itself.  It was very kid-friendly, with a casual environment.  The food was served quite quickly and the location itself was very clean.  I will eat at Five Guys again; however, I'd be just as happy with a Burger King double cheeseburger as I was with the Five Guys burger --fries not included..."}
{"text":"I had a crazy craving for a burger and fries so I thought, why not go to 5 guys!? Only my second time, last time was about 4 years ago. You walk in and order...I got a cheese burger, small fry and reg pop. When she said $15.40 I was like holy really but it was actually worth it. Had to wait maybe 5 min for my order and I took it to go. Quite a few people eating inside and munching on peanuts. It was a pretty darn good burger and definitely fulfilled my craving.  Thought it was just going to be a single cheese burger but there were two patties, must be their usual."}
{"text":"Quite the burgers and the clientele show it.  The only 6 pack in evidence were those the clients left in their pickup trucks.  I am a chubby guy and I felt pretty slim standing in line at this place,  But what did you expect  from a place that considers double burgers as normal uses peanut oil on the fries and as an appetizer gives you all  the fresh roasted bulk salted peanuts you want?  highly recommended better quality meat than Boogie Burgers and better fries but Boogie puts together a better burger  over all"}
{"text":"I must say I was very impressed with this location!  This was my first time at a five guys in Ontario and I'm glad I finally went. The burgers are delicious and made fresh to order. The fries portion are huge and always hot. The location is clean and welcoming. The prices are a little high compared to some of the other chains but the quality was untouchable. I had the original hamburger and my fiancé had the bacon cheeseburger and we both left FULL and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Just came back from the newly opened Mississauga location, it was very busy even at 9PM. Signs all over the place say 7 days a week until 10PM (IIRC). It's at Burnhamthorpe & Erin Mills.  Menu is really short, hamburger/cheeseburger/bacon cheeseburger or little burger/cheeseburger/bacon cheeseburger. Choice of cajun fries or regular fries. No chicken sandwich of any sort that I saw. $2.99 grilled cheese sandwich sounded intriguing and I heard plenty of them being ordered. Free peanuts to eat while you wait for them to call your number. Their regular burgers are 2 patties equalling 7oz. and the \"little\" burgers are single patty 3.5oz. The \"regular\" bacon cheeseburger was $8.79 before tax for just the burger I believe. After adding a regular cajun fries, tax included, it was roughly 14 bucks  Tons of teenagers working in bright red shirts behind the line, at least 10 people on the cooking stations..  The sign under the burger ordering area indicates burgers are only cooked to \"juicy but well done\" and yeah the burger was grey and fully cooked, but it was \"juicy\" (how much of that is grease though I wonder). Patties seem to be minimally seasoned, just good old fashioned griddled beef. Cheese is regular bright yellow american cheese which melts but stays thick, bacon was a decent amount but very thin. The one thing that stood out were the disappointing pickles topping for the burger. Not alot of flavor and sliced into coin shapes.. I was hoping for a good dill pickle slice or a new pickle slice.  Too much lettuce on the hamburger, way too much, and too coarsely cut.  Bags of potatoes all over the place, including the ordering lineup area. Cajun fries is an interesting idea but I was sick of the 'seasoning' after I ate some of them. Also they were over seasoned IMO, too overpowering. Will definitely 100% opt for the plain fries, which are indeed fresh cut, next time.  Pretty good stuff, Let's hope it stays consistent. Also they need gravy for the fries."}
{"text":"Went Jan 11th at 8pm - first timer.  First impressions, wow, that is a lot of potatoes stacked up all around, and 'free peanuts' - nice.  Ordered the single hamburger because I didn't want a double.  GF was excited they had a grilled cheese on the menu.  Split an order of seasoned cajun fries.    Burger was tasty.  Similar quality to a Fatburger.  Fries were overseasoned for my taste.  I would order the normal fries next time.  You do get a TON of fries, and they are almost as good as new york fries.  Overall, nothing special - dirty restaurant and tables, partially due to peanut shells everywhere.  Worker was sweeping the floor, cleaning tables, but clearly missed the peanut shells / pop that were all over one of the chairs at our table.  Worth trying, at least once."}
{"text":"The American Burger or Grease has arrived.   The one little pet peeve I have about all these American dives coming to Canada is that I have nothing to look forward to when I head to the states, however there is an exception to this place.  The burger joint has just opened in the Mississauga area and as expected it is very packed. The moment you walk in the first thing you'll notice is the amount of staff members working, there had to be about 10 people behind the counter. Even with the amount of people working the service was pretty slow although that's a okay by me b/c it is brand new so the employees can get away with it for now.  On to the food. I love their menu b/c it's short and right to the point. The regular burgers consists of two patties and the little burgers consists of one patty. There are two different types of fries cajun or regular. The burgers are well seasoned and very juicy however very greasy. The fries are also very good however I recommend you get cajun fries to get a little better taste and only one order of fries if you're with a group of people b/c it's alot.   Now the only reason I didn't give this place a better rating is b/c I've eaten at Five Guys in the states and the States does the burger way better. The burger in the States is alot tastier and alot less grease.   I would most likely go back but probably not for a while. I have a feeling the next time I eat a five guy burger it will be in the states.  Items to definetly get:  - Cheesburger - Cajun Fries"}
{"text":"I am rating this Five Guys as a comparison to others that  I have been to in the Charlotte.  As a transplant from California, In-N-Out was my staple burger place. After 3 years in Charlotte, I am ready to admit that I have officially defected to Five Guys.   Of the many options for Five Guys in the area, this is the location that consistently pumps out exactly what I want. Don't get me wrong, in a crunch I'll visit the Epicenter or some other location, but this is the one that is my golden standard. This is why this Five Guys rocks it out:  - Never a line. I don't know how they do it, but of the many times I've been here, I have never stood in line (ok, maybe they are sometime finishing up with one person). Perhaps I just happen upon the place at off-peak times, but hey, that is my experience.  - Consistently well-prepared burgers. At various locations, I've noticed subtle differences in the preparation--either too greasy or not greasy enough, lacking in condiments, bun falling apart. Whenever I come here, I get perfect buns and fries with the right amount of condiments.  - The staff is awesome. I always see smiles and familiar faces.  - Vicinity to the Mallard Creek Greenway: there is no better way to follow up an 8 mile run than to regain all of those lost calories. That my dirty little secret."}
{"text":"Food is good, but orders are never right. I just don't have time to waste running back and forth to get my simple order correct."}
{"text":"Perfect burgers, plentiful fries, endless sodas. This is burgers done right.  They always post the sources of there potatoes, sometimes Prince Edward Islands, sometimes Eastern Washington state, even Idaho.  And the music is good!"}
{"text":"I had a medium fry and little burger. Wow how could anybody eat a large anything here?  I will say it was very fresh and cooked perfectly. I'd be back."}
{"text":"very yummy-somewhat overpriced, you bottleneck waiting for your food,  The fries were out-f-this-world good! K"}
{"text":"I may have misjudged this place before. The food they serve is fresh and with the right toppings it's actually quite tasty. The grilled mushrooms are awesome and they have really good fries.   The portions are generally huge. Their \"regular\" sized fries feeds 3 average people easily (or 2 people like me)."}
{"text":"When craving a burger when passing on MacLeod, this is a great stopover. The burgers are awesome, with toppings the way you like, I like the jalapeño on it to give a good kick. Fries are huge, I make a mistake of ordering a large,,which is way too much. This location is tucked away in a corner but worth the stop when on MacLeod Trail."}
{"text":"can't understand what the hype is about. double patties, yes .. but flavor is non existent. two stars because of the free peanuts.  save your money and go to big smoke instead"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers and fries for the money! Without a doubt the most consistent product with free re-fills for pop and huge fries orders!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I just need a quick good burger, I am not a fan of any of the larger chains. Mississauga is lacking in the burger market and really needs a good joint, this is an above average place where their bacon cheeseburger will fill you up and you won't regret it. The customer service could get five stars on its own as they are all nice and courteous which surprisingly enough is starting to lack in most places."}
{"text":"This is a review for the new Five Guys on McLeod trail. Same great burgers and fries as the other location, except not quite as busy, so you can avoid the long lines. If you want a real feedbag of a meal, order up a cheese burger with a hot dog as another layer of meat with your all of your favorite toppings. This is mighty tasty and not for the feint at heart! I also ask for my fries to be well done!"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick pre-dinner snack and I ordered the regular Hamburger(~$9). This came with two patties and all the trimmings of tomato, lettuce, grilled onions, mushrooms, pickles, pepper, and my choice of sauce: mayo. I like that burgers here come with two patties as a standard but for anyone with a smaller stomach there is also the option of a little hamburger. The patty here is definitely juicy and almost on the quality of what you'd find atShark Club though it has a little more oil and this is shown as it soaks through whatever bag you might house the burger in. The seasoning is akin to A&Wwhich means it's a pleasant patty to bite into. Having things like grilled mushrooms ups the value here and one burger was enough for me to call it a meal thanks to the two patties."}
{"text":"I don't know what is about this place.  I go infrequently, it's crowded, there's always a long line up, but the burgers AND fries are exceptionally good.  Don't plan to stick around too long.  Your seat is required in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"In a world where burgers are burgers and....ok this is not a movie trailer. While Five Guys is \"just a burger place\", it does what it does really well. First off, you \"standard burgers comes with 2 patties of artery clogging, floaty making, gout causing, sloppy, crunchy on the edge, corn-fed beef. Options are plentiful so you can have your delicious burger many ways. Like onions? mushrooms? Hate mustard? To borrow a term, you really can have it your way. If you don't like burgers, go eat grass. No really, it's call Five Guys Burgers and Fries for a reason. What do you think five dudes would do to a burger? Put endives on it and have escargot as a side item? I think not. However, they know the the restaurant needs to be clean and the staff needs to be friendly and presentable for customers to want to come back. They've got both. Mind you, you order at the counter and when your order is ready, it comes in a brown bag. They do all this with familiar casualness and with smiling faces. It's about six bucks for the bacon cheeseburger and four for the large fries (which, because it's freshly cut and cooked in peanut oil, taste fantastic). I've not tried the other items on the menu yet but the burger craving will will beckon me back to Five Guys very soon."}
{"text":"I jumped on the Five Guys bandwagon just after they appeared in the Toronto region. While their burgers are excellent, there are several new places that will give them a run for the money....hence the drop of a star. While still good...they need to up their game now. On our last few visits I thought that they've gotten cheap with the fries and service was just ok. No banter amongst staff, just the robotic courtesies one would expect from a McDonalds. Although I'm still a fan, other places are starting to eat into their rating...."}
{"text":"My first time eating at a Five Guys, and I do not understand where all the rave is about. I was really disappointed with my burger. The service could not be worst! It took them 5 minutes to realized that my food had not been given to me. I was given the wrong order. I am very picky about my burger.   The staff is unfortunately clueless, and not highly motivated. They rather make jokes between them, the assist customers."}
{"text":"Il y a longtemps que j'entends parler de Five Guys. Fana des burgers, il fallait que j'essaie. J'ai été déçu, \"sloppy burger\" dans le mauvais sens du mot. POurtant, il y a tant de commentaires positifs. À rééssayer probablement."}
{"text":"Way over priced for what you get. Union Burger is way better and better priced . Plus they service beer.  The Service here was slow and the fires were soggy won't be back here!"}
{"text":"I go here probably once a week, and just want to write that this has some of the best service out there.  I tend to order random items, ask for things like extra patties that aren't on the menu, and they NEVER Mess up my order. Are always courteous, polite,  and a few even recognize me.  Just want to give them an A+ on food and service"}
{"text":"Huge Burgers, Alot of Fries, Free refills...and peanuts while you wait for your food! What else could you want??? Kinda pricey for burgers but they are huge....if I might add maybe just maybe the meat might need a bit of salt.....maybe? The place has cramped seating but it's okay as long as the place isn't packed, in which it does in the weekends. Overall the food is good."}
{"text":"Always good fresh juicy burgers. They are a bit over price, but I'll pay it because they are delicious. I really wish this burger joint had milkshakes, I mean a burger joint needs milkshakes. If you have a peanut allergy like my son, stay away as the fries are cooked in peanut oil and peanuts are in open boxes in the dining area."}
{"text":"I'd add a .5 for the service I received to make it 3.5/5.  Amid at least five of my friends' craze over Five Guys, I decided to give this joint a shot and compare it to my favourite burger joint, Hero. I specifically chose this one as I was in the nearby vicinity.  Upon entry, you will immediately notice the order desk to the left. There weren't a lot of people when I arrived (it was at around 1:30pm), but I figure if there were a lot that area may be cramped. In terms of initial service though, the cashiers were very nice and attentive, and my order was placed within seconds.  The seating area was positive in terms of diversity. There are areas for groups, while there are others for singles or couples.  My burger was complete in about 5 minutes, and I arrived to pick up my order. No problem there. The burger itself was, I admit, quite juicy for a well done patty (I'm used to the medium well patties Hero Burger uses). The cheddar cheese also looked quite good, but something was telling me it wasn't fresh as it tasted a little off. Finally, the burger itself was huge (at least 6oz), though upon looking it didn't seem that way. I can definitely see the value of $10 with a drink after finishing it.  Why am I not giving it 4 stars? I eventually found out they use peanut oil to make the burger. That explains it! Peanut oil preserves the taste (which probably explained the cheese as well), but it's not healthy for you. Once or twice it's okay, but this is not a place where you should go everyday, as it can increase your risk of health related problems.  Finally, don't wear a jacket in this place over the summer, it's really hot in there, at least there doesn't seem to be A/C.  PS: Starbucks wifi reaches here."}
{"text":"After all the hype surrounding 5 Guys, I had to try the Calgary location, even if it meant going to Deerfoot Meadows on the weekend.  A few quick pointers about 5 Guys:  1) All burgers are a double patty unless it's a \"little burger\".  2) Toppings are unlimited and free.  3) Fries are fried in peanut oil.  4) Free refills on all pop.  The place was busy with a line-up running to the door and a few open tables available when we arrived at 4pm.  After shuffling to the front of the line I made my order, cheeseburger, veggie & cheese sandwich, regular Cajun fries and two pops, for $17.50.  You are given your cups for your drinks and then your number for your order.  Like most things new to Calgary, it's fair to say a large share of the suburban shopping crowd didn't get that your number will be called out later.  Luckily, the caller was a loud, boisterous dude who had no patience for customer's ignorance.  \"NUMBER 17!\" \"NUMBER ONE SEVEN!\" \"SEVAN-TEEEEEEEN! YOUR ORDER IS UP!!!!\"  It was almost worth going here alone to watch people who had held up the line for close to 5 minutes, and prevented other people from receiving their order, sheepishly walk up and take responsibility for their burgers and fries.  Promptly grabbing my brown bag from the counter, when I went to get the burgers I realized they'd topped off the *entire* bag with fries. Not bad for a \"regular\".  My burger was covered in toppings aplenty, ditto the condiments. This is not clean or subtle food, and quite frankly, you need to keep the wrapper around half of your meal to keep from wearing it.  Taste-wise, it was comparable to a Whopper meets Fatburger. Or, how Peter's Drive In burgers *used* to taste.  The veggie and cheese sandwich was less of a hit, because it's simply a bun with veggies and cheese in it. No veggie patty. So ... for those who don't eat beef, your options are extremely limited.  The Cajun fries were coated in the dark red spices and had a nice, slow, smoky bite to them. We finished the order and thanks to the rest in the bag, had enough to take home.  While I wouldn't say 5 Guys is the best burger I've ever had, it's pretty good. If you're visiting the cultural metropolis that is Deerfoot Meadows, it's much cheaper than neighbouring Fatburger, and open longer, from 11am-10pm every day."}
{"text":"This Five Guys is located right by the Arbor Hills subdivision and in front of University Research Park.  I love their hamburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches and the fries servings are big enough to feed a family of ten.   The place is clean and never too crowded."}
{"text":"Five Guys burgers are simply the best. I'm really particular about how I like my beef cooked and they make all their burgers well done. You do have to wait a while for your food b/c they make your burger when you order it, which isn't a bad thing. I think I would prefer to wait for a burger that's fresh rather than get a burger that's been sitting around for a while quickly. This location can get pretty packed around the lunchtime hours.....noon-2pm, so you might want to allow some extra wait time for your food. I usually get double bacon cheeseburgers when I go, which has gone up in price, but it's still worth it. The fries....they're not bad, but I just gotta have a taste for them. They sure will fill a brown paper bag up with those fries. One order would easily feed 2 adults. If you want a good quality burger, Five Guys is the place to get it"}
{"text":"Before heading here with friends, all I used to hear about was how good the burgers are. But after going here several times, I really don't think this place is anything special. Yeah, you can get an above average burger for an alright price, but I just wasn't impressed.  As a place that touts the \"best\" burger voted by several places year after years, I really have trouble believing it. It's good, but lacking in so many areas. First of all, if you sell burgers you should have a vast selection of toppings. They do have plenty of choices, but they're missing the 2 best out there: chili & slaw. How do you at least not have chili? It boggles my mind because every time I eat here I look for those 2 toppings & every time I'm disappointed to not find them.  As for the side of fries, yep...find someone to share a small order with. These things never seem to disappear as you eat away & away. They aren't anything special, but who doesn't like a good bag of french fries? They're a little too salty for my taste but I suppose that's a cherished thing across America.  So Five Guys will feed you plenty for a good price. You'll get an above average burger, but nothing that will have you speechless or clamoring to come back for more. I just suggest to stick with the small order of fries & share with a friend, or else you'll be chomping away for a while."}
{"text":"Loved the fries. The burger was good but we like the taste of fat burger better. also they were kind of pricey for burger and fries. Worth a try"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong! If I am absolutely craving a burger, I go here. It's a slam-dunk. Their staff is always friendly, the wait is never too long, and everything is fresh made to order!"}
{"text":"I like Five Guys and this location conforms to my expectations from other locations.  They give us plenty of fries. The burgers have all the toppings we ordered. Everything tasted great.  Five Guys is a chain and I don't want to write too much unless it is about how this location stands out from another location.  If you haven't been to Five Guys it is a good burger with as much toppings as you want."}
{"text":"Hate to say this about a US chain, but 5 guys has the best burger in Cowtown.  Burgers are a little messy when you have them 'all the way' like I did so it may not be the best place for a first date, but the ingredients are fresh, the all-beef patties are cooked to perfection and delicious, and the fries taste like they should in a perfect world.  Word of warning - I'm a big guy and I love food, and I order the 'little' burger.  When you look at their menu (which basically has 4 items on it) it may look expensive, but trust me you get more than what you pay for."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the fam on a Saturday night and although it looked packed, we only waited about 10 minutes to get our food.  Not bad.  The burgers were just as good when I had them in California and the cajun fries are delicious!  So flavorful you don't even really need ketchup.  Probably the only difference between this one and the one in Cali - the one in Cali had tons of peanut shells strewn all over the floor.  I got the little cheeseburger this time (last time I got a regular cheeseburger and not knowing it had 2 patties, I split it with the hubby) and it was nice and juicy and the cheese nicely melted.  I love the grilled onions.  Minus a star since it's so far from my place."}
{"text":"After trying 5 guys in Medicine Hat in early 2010, I've been dying for it to come to #yyc. Of course when it finally showed up I was on my diet. Well now that my diet and I aren't on speaking terms, I thought it was time to get my burger on.   First things first - be prepared to wait. This place is uber popular and if you wait less than 15 minutes, consider yourself lucky. No matter how good the food is, I have issues with paying over $13 for a burger meal. After saying that, the burgers and fries are damn tasty. You can choose any toppings you want (and they have tons available) and the size of the fries is ridiculously huge. Throw in non-stop fountain drinks and it is something to be tried for all. If I were to recommend one thing regarding the burgers, don't go crazy with the toppings. The burgers get messy fast but with the size I guess thats to be expected."}
{"text":"The great American burger stand comes to Calgary.  If you live in the south, there's no longer a reason to go to Peters in the north.  This place is all about excess. Too expensive, too much grease, too much burger, and too big a serving in regular fries.  In other words, it's perfect.  Hedonists and gluttons unite!"}
{"text":"Very friendly, as expected from a Five Guys restaurant. We were greeted immediately as we walked in and were given a number for them to call out later. Free peanuts at the side of the store and also on the counter where you pick up your order.   Free refills. There was one pesky fly around us as we tried eating our food. The jalapeños here are HOT! I had to drown myself in 3 cups of iced tea because I couldn't stand it. Maybe the jalapeños this season are just extra hot. I've never had this problem before but needless to say, a funny and yummy experience. Washrooms are clean and single stalled."}
{"text":"5 Guys has been on my list to check out for my next visit down to Deerfoot Meadows. That visit was today, and I held true to my word.  I stopped in around 2 pm, I didn't expect it to be busy at all. And while it wasn't packed, there was still a steady stream of people coming through the door.   My first impression? Well, I wasn't really sure what to think. The line was bordered by sack upon sack of potatoes. Odd. The open grill and kitchen was busy and noisy, complete with one of the employees singing along to the Bon Jovi song that was playing at the top of her lungs. Claims to fame of burger awards and compliments adorned the walls. My visit was starting out at about a 3 star.  I knew better than to order a regular burger. Instead, I went for a Little Cheeseburger with \"everything\". That meant mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup and mustard. The burger was priced right around $5. But with fries and a drink, my total was just over $11.  It was a good 10 minute wait for my order to be ready. I can see where visiting this spot on a weekend or over a peak lunch or dinner hour might be something you want to avoid. I took my burger to go and brought it home, still well and ready to have this be a 3 star review.  The burger and the fries changed my mind. That burger was fresh and piled up with some pretty tasty toppings. I did my best to savour the burger, but I'm afraid it was only a slight pace off of inhaling my food. And the fries... they sure know how to cook 'em. They reminded me of a spot back home in Millet called the Burger Barn. The fries there were always hand cut and homemade.   While I will stick to avoiding 5 guys at the busiest of times, I do believe I'll be looking for an excuse to head down for another little burger."}
{"text":"This time not so soggy and sloppy.  Was manageable to eat. Still love the fries.  I like how all toppings are free.  Decent place for a double patty burger.  (tho too much for me and I always share)!"}
{"text":"Tryed this place today because of all the hype surrounding it. I wasnt overly impressed. long wait time. And the burgers weren't bad but not great either and they had disgusting processed cheese that really killed it for me. Still on the look out for a great burger!"}
{"text":"Great burger fries and service but very pricey. A burger fries and a drink cost me 15 bucks. This burger is delicious but 2nd to Red Robin."}
{"text":"LOVE FIVE GUYS!! But no this one specifically. The service the food the all about everything is great. But minus one star for prices, and the open grill. Like holy f--k expensive. The grill \"open\" meaning the thing smokes up the entire restaurant. I don't smoke but it feels like I were in a room full of chain smokers."}
{"text":"So, 5 guys just opened this location a few weeks back and I figured I would check it out.  I've eaten here twice now, sheerly out of the fact that its in the same shopping complex as my office.  In the two times that I've been here, I've gone with the same thing-small cheeseburger with some toppings on it.  The burgers are better then I remember when I first tried 5 guys a few years ago, which is better then the first time I went back when I lived in Mesa.  I didn't have a good experience dining there and haven't been back since. Until now.  I will say the burgers are better then I remember.  But, overall, I'm just not impressed with them as a whole. Here's why:  For starters, I find them to be ridiculously overpriced.  I got a small pop and a cheeseburger and it was $7.42.  No, thats not horrible, but all my co-workers and I agreed that they are expensive.  If I had gone with a full meal (meaning gotten the fries) it would have cost me well over 10-12 dollars.  That's for a small cheeseburger!  No combo meals here, everything is a la carte.  Secondly, the wait both times has been tremendous. The first time I waited almost 15 minutes for my order! Today the wait was about the same.  There were 10 orders ahead of us, and we were all in a rush to get our food.  I know it sounds crazy, but they seem to have a big grill with lots of people working behind the counter, and they seem to make the burgers as their ordered, but in batches.  I can't understand how they can get that behind. I mean, there's a guy standing there making like 10 burgers at time, and like 3 or 4 guys on the grill.  Why the wait then?  Thirdly, everything comes in a brown bag. Even if your dining in.  I don't get it. Why can't I get a plate or something? Especially if I had gotten fries, it just seems like a weird way to eat and serve food.  Lastly, the seating here is okay, but when we were there during a rush, there was a limited about of tables.  There were 4 of us and we were unable to dine in, so we got our food to go.  They have a mixture of high bar stool type tables that seat 3, and some 4 tops for seating as well.   If the place was busy, like it was today at lunch, there really wasn't a place to sit for all 4 of us.  Not a huge problem, but it did damper our experience there as we were all hoping to dine in and sit together.  On the upside, they do have peanuts galore for you to snack on while your waiting, and one of those really cool pop machines that has a million different flavors to choose from.  Overall, its just okay. I'm not unimpressed, but I'm not over the moon about this place either."}
{"text":"Maybe I just heard too much about this place that put my expectations really high or something, but I haven't been blown away like some people seem to have been.   It's a good burger, don't get me wrong. They do a good job and it is a tasty well cooked burger, and nice that it's cooked to order. I just was expecting more flavor or spices in the meat. For a plain Jane burger it's a nice option to have.   The atmosphere is plastic posters of review quotes they have selected and tile work that is not eye catching at all. You can also help yourself to free peanuts while waiting for your order.     Some nice small touches that the others don't have. Overall an average experience and wouldn't go out of my way to get here but wouldn't avoid the place either."}
{"text":"i went to five guys burgers and fries and i am writing in caps and i am not sure if it will show up but i am very displeased as they do not have a veggie burger. welcome to the twenty first century you five! not everyone loves regular person burgers. quite displeased. will be taking my hunger for veggie burgers elsewhere. so there."}
{"text":"The wife and I ate lunch here today. As soon as we walked in the door we were greated. We ordered our food and had it in just a few minutes. The entire staff seemed very friendly. We opened our bags and were surprised to see a double burger and enough fries for 3 people. The burger was so juicy I had the juice running down my chin. I am not sure who makes the buns but I would love to know so I could use them at home. The fries were also excellent and like I said, there were a lot of them. The only thing is, I wish they had onion rings. It would be a nice change from eating fries all the time."}
{"text":"I won't go into a full blown review for what Five Guys is.   If your expectations is a huge tasty burger that can be made exactly the way you want it and grilled to perfection along with the yummiest fries to hit the spot with free soda refills all under 15$, then you found the place.  Kindly note, there's no drive through and the wait to get your food can sometimes take 5-10 minutes as they create the huge burger of your choice. The staff tends to look bored and serve you somewhat slowly. It's hit and miss in this regard.  A must try for the burger and fries!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place before I went which is probably a bad thing, since then it has a lot to live up to right off the bat.  I got the little cheeseburger and cajun fries.   The burger? Extremely tasty, but...small-ish? For the price, I was expecting something more. I like that they don't charge you for all the fun toppings (and maybe that's WHY the price is so high...) but for someone like me that only gets ketchup and mayo...it's $$. The fries? Disappointing. VERY. I like that they were fresh, but I like crispy, well-done fries and these were not. I also found the cajun spice underwhelming...almost unnoticeable. Not to mention...they just gave me too many. Maybe it's stupid to complain about getting TOO much food, but really it was overkill. I guess I wouldn't be complaining if I liked them, although my waistline would be. :)  It was fun to try once, but I'll probably stick with my C & Dubbs."}
{"text":"Tasty Burgers and fries, free peanuts were great, huge portions, a long line that went very very quickly....  But....  Restaurant is chaotic and was packed on Sunday noontime, Burger was an absolute mess, fell apart and showed a total lack of  care or interest in the creation of it. Also disappointingly expensive for the experience.  Fun, lots of food and pretty tasty, but more dollars than I expected, and burger became more of a soggy salad than a burger."}
{"text":"What better way to celebrate a big new purchase than by hitting a hugely hyped burger joint to get doused in grease and condiments? Kat and I have been planning to visit Five Guys for quite some time, and we were not overly disappointed.   Pros: the burger and fries. When we were about to order the large fries to share, the cashier informed us that a large usually feeds about 3-4 people, so we downgraded to the regular, which was good for two. She was right. The container was packed full, and there was about another half container's worth of fries strewn in the greasy bag. Kat stuck to her regular regiment of onions, tomatoes and relish on a single cheeseburger, while I got sauteed mushrooms and onions, ketchup, mustard and pickles on my single cheese. The burgers were heavy, messy and delicious. The handcut fries were also excellent, two steps above New York Fries. Although they aren't the best burgers in the city, they would be in the top ten for sure.  Cons: the interior decor and service. It is a wide open, concrete area (with an ugly ceiling), with giant boxes of \"fries\" lying around, and quotes everywhere. The radio was a notch above normal levels, and the sound bounced around a lot. Coupled with the obnoxiously loud burger prep people either singing along or yelling at each other, it was cacophonous enough to prompt Kat to question my hearing. Some of the workers didn't seem very impressed with their situation, cleaning tables at a Five Guys.  In-between: the prep time. This is not a McDonald's operation with the imperative on speed. They take their time to cook the orders as they are placed - as to whether the hamburger patties are fresh or frozen, that is inconclusive. The end result is tasty.  Overall I feel that Five Guys merits the four stars for the food alone. If we were to visit again, I would prefer to get the burgers to go and enjoy them in a quiet location."}
{"text":"Waaaaay better than other fast food burger joints. The cajun fries are amazing and the burgers juicy and satisfying. The wait was oddly long for 7pm on a weekday but the service was very friendly. Will come again when I crave clogged arteries."}
{"text":"Messy, un-cleared tables, overflowing garbage bins. Peanut shells all over the floor. Processed cheese, not real cheese, looks like cheese wiz.  Music was so loud I couldn't hear the person I was eating lunch with.  Fries were average, not amazing like all the signage in the restaurant claims.  Jalapenos were fresh, not pickled, which was nice. Burgers have 2 patties but it's not obvious when ordering.  Buns aren't anything special.  Kind of pricey if you don't get \"everything\" on it."}
{"text":"These folks gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside. I called ahead to order for lunch and my food wasn't quite ready by the time I made it in. No worries, it was up in a jiffy. Everyone was nice, made eye contact, and seemed genuinely happy that I was there. Despite Five Guys' rising prices, the burger is still worth it I suppose."}
{"text":"Not sure what took me so long to try Five Guys! I had heard many rave reviews... and I will add my voice to the chorus now... I am a big fan!   This is how a burger is done.   I love the option to add as many toppings as you'd like from their extensive menu of options. They also add the condiments for you, that's quite nice. I think the portion sizing is just right and the taste and flavor as well as juiciness is perfection!  Great location right next to Menchie's too! Fabulous serivce too, very quick and extra polite and friendly.   We will be back!  A++"}
{"text":"The burgers were pretty good - but don't get the \"double with everything\" as it's a little on the messy side, at least for your first time.  It was a big mess. Fries are a pleasant surprise too.    However, the restaurant itself is disgusting and dirty, and lacks completely in atmosphere.  Bathrooms were putrid and appeared not to have been cleaned in several days. The crowd was also a little scruffy.  Although I was there with my young family (kids are 3, 6 and 8), there was a table of construction guys swearing their heads off right next to us, but the table next to us was no better, with a family of obese people swearing openly in front of their small children.  This is not a classy place, for sure.  So, I would recommend Five Guys, but only for take-out until they clean up their act substantially."}
{"text":"Ok five guys serves up a good product for fast food. I will say this location is better than Utahans locations. But the prices are still a bit much."}
{"text":"Upon entering 5 guys I got a whiff of the food and I was ready. I liked the fact that all the toppings are free and so are the refills. I saw this couple eating Cajun fries and licking their fingers so I decided to copy them and order them as well.   The toppings were delicious, bun soft, meat not frozen, cheese American but there was something missing my entire meal... Seasoning! I think the meat and fries are under seasoned. The fries needed salt. The food wasn't memorable in my opinion.  The customer service was excellent! They were friendly, informative and patient. They offered me extra fries and when they forgot to put cheese on my burger they added it for no charge.  I'm sorry yelpers but I'm a little underwhelmed by this place. I had high hopes because this girl at my works swears this place has the best burgers but I can honestly say I prefer a licks burgers especially considering the prices are around the same."}
{"text":"Really, I just don't see the reason for the hype up and down the western and eastern seaboard.  One of the fastest growing hamburger chains in North America, they specialize in the basic hamburgers, fries and shakes.  I found the meat to be decent, but actually underseasoned and tasteless overall.  I liked the unlimited toppings thing, but that was the only saving grace that they offered for anything in a bun.  It was in the fries that they excelled, and found them to be pretty damn awesome.  I definately enjoyed the large servings with my friends, and I'm willing to enjoy another order any time any where as a snack.    I haven't tried the shakes yet, so I'll avoid any comment of course."}
{"text":"Our first time to a Five Guys.  These hamburgers were delicious! Of course, it would depend on what you have them add on the burger probably. Mine was a single, no cheese, with the usual good stuff like lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and grilled onions. I asked for the barbecue sauce and that was very tasty. The fries were also very good. Clerk was friendly and pleasant.   Restaurant seemed clean."}
{"text":"Love love love this place...great food and great service, especially when Gavin and Anna are there.  More than worth the trip every time!!"}
{"text":"Have you been to 5 guys before? No? Well you're probably going to need 5 guys with you to eat all the food you're about to order that you think you can eat yourself.  Sure you walk up to the register and place your order for a cheeseburger, fries and a coke. What would be any different than any other fast food place? Yeah the prices are a little higher but it's because of the better ingredients they put in right? Sure.  Whether you are eating in or getting your meal to go you are going to get it in a paper bag. This is so that they can bag your order and then dump a crap load of fries on top. That large fry you just ordered because you were a little extra hungry just turned into an extra medium fry.   If you're the average person you're going to want to order a little burger. It's too bad they don't offer a small fry because the regular fry is too much for one person to eat on their own. The toppings here are great and they have a lot of choice.  Expect to wait a little while for your meal. They're busy and it's going to take some time."}
{"text":"I first tried Five Guys at their Airdrie location, and it was excellent.  The south location was just as good.  Delicious food, huge portions, and a list of toppings that lets you make the burger *you* want (like Harvey's, but good).  It has \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" appeal, and although they might scare you when they yell out an order, you'll soon be drawn into the appeal.  Definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Really lived up to the reputation! Super friendly staff great burgers and huge portion of fries makes it a definite repeat place for me! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Cane here wth a group of friends just before closing. Fast service, clean facilities. Pricing wise its fair with a fair bit of customizations depending in what you'd like. Theres lots of tables around to sit and hangout while watching them make your burger through their transparent kitchen - probably my fav part of the entire restaurant. We ordered a double cheese burger and a regular cheeseburger with cajun fries. Id have to say their portions are quite big. We basically had a bagful of fries to share! So good.   Def recommend if your around the area!"}
{"text":"Five guys makes awesome burgers.  EXCEPT, they use yucky cheese SLICES instead of real cheddar.  And I'm sorry, but for $1 extra there's no excuse for not using real cheddar.  Americans love their American cheese (which is what Kraft singles are).  Also why aren't we getting milkshakes?  I would live that.  Also, adding onion rings would be awesome.  They are very hard to find on moat menus these days!  Staff are always great and friendly."}
{"text":"I think that this place is a little overrated. Swenson's is way better. My friends out in Arizona were being told by other westerners that Five Guys was better than In N Out. There is no way in hell. The french fries are really good though. Anything fried in peanut oil is awesome."}
{"text":"Five Guys is Five Star for what it offers: great burgers, great fries, and terrific service! One of their best online services they offer is the ability to put your order in and then run over and pick it up at whatever time you like - great for us busy Ballantyne folk at lunch. Don't expect ambience here - this is either a pick-up or quick eat-in restaurant. Do expect quality food at an incredibly reasonable price."}
{"text":"Four words: BEST BURGERS IN CHARLOTTE.  If you have a five guys near you just go and eat a burger and you'll never have anything else. They have the freshest ingredients and a cool inside that make you feel like you are in a older time. Awesome French fries that come straight from the farm potatoes. Peanuts are around, I've never known why but they are enjoyable."}
{"text":"Burger= double Whopper. Fries= meh. Location= superb. Whenever I don't have BK coupons, I can see myself returning.  How many guys does it take to make a burger in Lakewood? Five. One to drive everyone two blocks in his parents' crossover wagon with Sierra Club stickers. One to skateboard in front of the store on his break and fail at all tricks. One to sit around preaching about how he's going to attend OU and then feed all starving Africans with his 311 cover band's charity concert. One to leave early and make a boring YouTube video of his friends quoting Adult Swim cartoons at the T Bell drive thru, and one to microwave two Whoppers and slap them together without splashing mayo onto his gauged ears. Ta da!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to see the boys in a long time, with all the burger choices, I almost forgot about the burgers here. Luckily, I was tempted again! It was a good burger, definitely better than any of the chains but with all the \"Gourmet\" burger places out there, 5G's just doesn't rank as high as they used to.   The burgers were juicy and well cooked, found the taste pretty standard, was not blown away like the first time this place opened years ago. Somehow the burgers here just don't taste like they used to??? One thing that has not changed was the boxes of roasted peanuts available while you wait.   The fries (my criptonite) were just as good as I remember. I ordered the large size, quantity was less than I remember, and thought it was a tad overpriced as I used to get a bag full of potatoes now they measure it out in a drink cup (smaller than the drink cup they sell you) and add a scoop, probably out of guilt.   Overall, 5G's still makes a juicy better than average burger and fries, but for the price, there are many choices out there and finding a better burger in that range won't be hard to do."}
{"text":"I like Five Guys.  It's not my favourite burger joint by any stretch of the imagination, but I do get a craving every now and then, and it does satisfy.  I got a secret for you though... You see that \"grilled cheese\" on the menu? Did you know for $2.00 you can add a PATTY on that grilled cheese? It's true.  And I got another secret for you ... A \"grilled cheese\" at Five Guys is an inside-out hamburger bun with two pieces of cheese.  So when you turn a \"grilled cheese\" into a \"grilled cheeseBURGER\" you are actually saving $0.79 AND getting an extra piece of cheese. Try it. You won't regret it.  Just like with a regular old burger, you are also able to get unlimited toppings.  One more tip: the barbeque sauce is good, but if you order any sauce, order extra. In my opinion, they kinda go easy on the sauce, so ask 'em to sauce it up.  It'll be a better burger. A better \"saucy\" burger.  This goes for ketchup too."}
{"text":"For some reason, I don't know why this review has eluded me since this Five Guys is right across the street from my office.  I haven't been in forever so I got a little cheeseburger with cajun fries the other day for lunch.  Burgers are made to order and I had all the free toppings on it so it was pretty large for a \"little.\"  I guess the appeal of Five Guys has really died down in the past couple of years, I remember when people were raving about it and were all excited when Five Guys was in the neighborhood.  I think it's still a solid burger, but now-a-days I tend to lean more to a burger place with a little bit more selection and creative license with their burgers.  Don't get me wrong, keeping it simple is totally key, and Five Guys does this super well."}
{"text":"Lives up to all the hype I've heard about it. The burgers are delicious and so filling! I didn't realize it would be 2 patties in the burger. The amount of fries that we were given was unreal. It pretty much covered the bottom of the takeout bag. I was full from eating the burger and the fries that spilled out of the container and hardly even touched the ones in the container. So satisfied."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Burgers and Fries here are still dominant.  Quick comment on last visit to Deerfoot Meadows location: Went in at 9:02PM, and they close at 10pm.  With no \"adult\" supervising the dozen 15 - 19 year old staff members, cleanup head home mode started early.  At 9:10PM the mopping, scrubbing, and sweeping was in full force.  The cleaning fluids created a near noxious level of toxic indoor air pollution that went well with the burgers and fries har har har!  One of the kids was banging around the chairs with so much enthusiasm he deserved a raise!  Also, the classic rock background music got cranked to the level of a bar to motivate the cleanup and closing efforts.  I dont blame these kids for wanting to go home.  Its the management's fault for not implementing some helpful policies. For example, they could simply have a rule where the last order will be taken at 9:45 and its take out only or something."}
{"text":"I ordered the one patty burger while all my friends had the regular burger with random toppings. At five guys, a regular burger gets you two patties. I love that, in the wake of all those gourmet burger joints that charge an extra 50 cents - $1 for each topping, 5 burgers lets you add on all the extra toppings for free here. Including grilled mushrooms and sauteed onions!!!!!!!! That alone is worth one star.   The patty is made on a flat top grill and isn't pre-made. It could have been more flavourful/juicy but when eaten together w everything else on the burger it was alright  Luckily I didn't order it with fries because holy moly they give a lot!! Two of the guys ordered it and the four of us couldn't even come close to finishing it all.  ."}
