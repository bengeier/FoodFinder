{"text":"We just ate here this evening, and we will definitely be returning. The customer service was phenomenal, and the wings were even better. Cody greeted us as we walked in explained the entire menu, the favorites - spice levels, etc. Our food came out just quick enough so you knew it was freshly cooked just for you. The owner came over to our table to ask how the food was and our one year old daughter was quite pleased with the French fries. It's casual, but very clean Recommend 100% - YUM ."}
{"text":"Las Vegas Friends: I have no idea how this place got a 4.5/5 rating on Yelp. OVERALL IT STINKS. The wings were fine as were the sweet potato fries, but the coleslaw was not sweet enough and actually a little sour and the mac & cheese and baked beans were nothing to write home about. WORSE OF ALL, the chicken fingers, which make up half of the menu, were hard, dense and inedible."}
{"text":"Me and my family ate here for a late lunch. The service was great and the food was excellent! The wings are way better than Buffalo Wild Wings. The fries were yummy and crisp. The only thing I would say is go a little lighter on the butter for the Texas toast. Other than that, I loved it. They have that make you smile food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Have eaten here many times .. the owner is very nice... the only complaint I have is the online ordering is horrible. Other than that place has great food!"}
{"text":"Went on 9/23/16 This is my new go to spot for wings. Tried the pb&j, razzle dazzle, Cajun (very good), BBQ, and hot wings and they were delicious. Wings, toast and flavors work amazing and cooked perfectly. Wings were juicy, crispy, and big.  Texas Toast was good. Owner was friendly and welcoming. All in all 9.7/10 only because they don't have boats to put your chicken bones in, but it was minor and newly opened."}
{"text":"One of the best wing spots in town!! Very friendly staff and very attentive. My new favorite wing spot! Just need lunch hours now :)"}
{"text":"Ah, such mixed feelings about Wing Time.  So many good things, but some not-so-good things that keep me from going back as much as I might.

THE GOOD:
*Really tasty wings and sauces
*Excellent fries, especially the sweet potato fries
*Good variety
*Nice, clean and comfortable seating area
*Friendly employees
*They have Diet Dr. Pepper (the drink of the gods!!)

THE NOT-SO-GOOD:
*Pretty high prices.  You do get a lot of food in a combo, but I still feel paying $10+ for a fast-food type meal is getting pretty steep.  
*Confusing menu.  After you go a few times, it's a little easier... but I appreciate a good straight forward menu that's easy to read and understand.  Wing Time's is not that.
*The owner is extremely chatty.  Ok yeah, that might seem like a good thing.... and trust me, I do appreciate that he tries to be personable... but there's a line between being friendly and being annoying, and he definitely crossed that with us on our first visit.  We had a hard time figuring out what to order (see point above) and he kept trying to \"help\" us with his suggestions, but it was just making us feel more confused.  We kept telling him we just needed a minute to think, and he wouldn't leave us alone. Then when we finally ordered and got our food, he would not stop coming back to our table to talk about all the other businesses he's owned, all the great ideas he has, etc.  We just wanted to eat our wings, dangit!  Leave us alone!  I have gone back a couple times since then and I was so relieved he wasn't around.  We got to eat our meals in peace!

So, overall, I think WingTime is a solid 4-stars.  If you're searching for some tasty wings and fries you should definitely give them a try. I would go back more often myself (even with the over zealous owner) if the prices were just a touch better."}
{"text":"Enjoyable meal. Service was a little slow but the trade off was fresh delicious food. Clean established, great customer service. Had a chance to talk to the owner, seems to have a lot of great and Interresting ideas. Looking forward to my next visit and new items on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was amazing definitely coming back! Awesome environment, everyone was nice the owner came and check on us asked if we needed anything he is so nice. Great place for wings and tender everything is just great!"}
{"text":"I rarely ever get to the far north end of town. Thankfully, I had to visit a friend and needed to get some grub. Saw this place and decided to give it a shot (I didn't even check Yelp first... I know... how can I???). The owner (Lance) is as friendly as can be and works hard to make sure your visit is a pleasurable experience. The wings were delicious, the fingers were on point. Even the fries out great! Looks like I'll have to find more reasons to drive to this end of town, just so I can get some more Wingtime!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has 5 stars. I feel like I could have saved a ton of driving time and just gone to wing stop or made wings at home and put peanut butter and jelly on them.

My experience goes as follows. I ordered pick up as my boyfriend had a random craving for wings, when we opened our boxes and took the first bite and immediately regretted it. 

The wings were soggy not at all crispy like I had anticipated. Secondly they forgot to put sauce on my orange wings and they were undercooked. 

My boyfriend only had sauce on some of his and they were mushy as if they were baked. 

Try this place at your own risk but I will be the first to say that the reviews are quite misleading. I was expecting something amazing and they delivered nothing close to this. The undercooked meat was concerning as well. If you go here you are better off ordering the fries and a soda. Please check the reviews not recommended as there are multiple complaints about their undercooked meat. This needs to be reported to the health department. 

Response to wing time: whether I ordered take out or dine in is irrelevant as there is no excuse for the poor quality of this food. Yes you handed me my raw mush food directly to my face. My honest review of my experience has nothing to do with \"you seemed like a nice person\" which is actually amusing to me. The fact that I wrote a review of my experience and you make it seem like I'm not a nice person because of it shows the lack of professionalism at this establishment. I am highly disappointed. All I have to say is a picture is worth 1000 words."}
{"text":"Are here twice and both times the wings were undercooked. The second time I even asked for the wings to be cooked longer and we're still undercooked. Never coming here again. 
BE AWARE owner will respond to you for bad reviews telling you that you are wrong for feeling negatively about his business."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place. The wings were meaty and the seasoning on the lemon pepper was so good. They have a nice variety and unique flavors. If you like sweet potato fries I highly recommend those as well!"}
{"text":"This place is going down too quickly. Place is not well kept as it was since it opened. Staff is not very pleasant at all. The lady at the front was making and mixing dipping sauce at the front register! The napkin holders were so dusty that I just couldn't pass up not taking a picture and sharing it here. This place needs a general deep cleaning bad. Until then, they will continue to drive people out. I do love their chicken wings and they're always the perfect size for your buck (compared to BWW)."}
{"text":"Great customer services. They have the best wings ever. Amazing customer service. Everyone is so nice as soon as you walk in. I will be back soon. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The wings are delish!! Rocky and Juan provided us with excellent customer service they were very friendly and helped us narrow down on witch wing sauce to get. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My go to wing places when on the north side of town.  Ton of flavors, great service, and a cool environment.  I have been here 4 times over the last 3 months, and really enjoy the food.  Sweet tea isn't sweet tea, just regular tea with corn syrup.  I saw her make it like that so just had her dumb it, and went with a different drink.  Not that big of deal...gotta remember I live in Vegas, not NOLA anymore...."}
{"text":"Wings and fingers were awesome got the garlic Parmesan, lemon pepper and pbj they were all really delicious. For the fingers I got mild and that was delicious as well. Honey mustard dip and ranch was also delicious. Service was awesome would come back most definitely."}
{"text":"Been here a few times before and the food was great. Last couple of times the wings and the chicken fingers were over cooked.  I hope this is not how they intend to continue because they really do have awesome wings."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in for lunch.  I ordered bone in wings with lemon pepper.  My wife had the boneless garlic Parmesan.  My wings were cooked perfectly but the oil was not allowed to drain before putting them in my tray.  The wings on the bottom of the tray were saturated with oil because they were in oil about 1/4 inch deep.  My wife's boneless wings were oily due to the excess batter that was on the so called boneless wings which had a very thick batter that held in the oil.  She ended up removing the batter and just eating the chicken.  The veggie sticks (carrots and celery) were old and crusty looking.  Like they had been in the refrigerator for quite a few days.  The Cole slaw was OK, but could have had just a little more sugar to make it better.  The music drove us crazy the entire time we were trying to enjoy our meal.  Why do businesses play Rap music?  Just turn off the so called music and let us eat in peace."}
{"text":"Great wings, great food at a decent price in a nice n quite location.  Will go back many times"}
{"text":"So hands down the BEST chicken place in Las Vegas! I love chicken, I could eat it all day errr day so if I say this is the best, you better believe it! I tried the chicken Parmesan sandwich combo and my husband ordered the 8 piece combo wings with the jerk and mild sauce. Thor garlic bread is to die for! The sauces were full of flavor and the size of the wings are a great size. The staff is friendly and patient when trying to decide what to order. The restaurant nice and clean and has comfortable seating. The one thing that really sells me on a place outside of the food is when the manager or owner in this case comes out and talks with all of their guests. When speaking with him, he was telling us about their chicken tenders and catering they do and brought out 2 huge chicken fingers in mild and garlic Parmesan for us to try. I have to tell ya, Its a 45 minutes drive from my house to wing time and I will drive all this way just for their chicken wings and tenders. You can tell this chicken is fresh and made to order, I could go all day on how great the food and staff is at this place. Do yourself a favor, if you are in the mood for chicken check this place out, you won't be disappointed. Oh I forgot to add, they are very affordable you can get a 6 piece combo that includes fries, garlic bread and a drink for under 10 bucks."}
{"text":"I had their new boneless wings and they were amazing. The two girls behind the counter were very friendly and helpful for us first timers. I can't wait to come back and try different sauces."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews, stopped for dinner. Wings are huge so the 6 piece was fine for me. Enjoyed lemon pepper and mild wings with fresh fries. Service was very friendly and was happy about the free refills."}
{"text":"Wasnt going to write a review until the manager called my girlfriend a liar on yelp about her review. The wings were in fact undercooked and i found a different place that cooks them perfect. I gave this place 2 chances and unfortunately they were undercooked both times. Maybe the cook can visually inspect them instead relying just on the thermometer. Also the manager likes to reply to the negative reviews and try and persuade you that you are wrong about your opinion. The truth is your wings are undercooked and although some people dont mind it, i and some others hate it. The way you come at customers leaving honest reviews is disrespectful and is another reason i will not return."}
{"text":"The establishment was very clean and had a clear theme. My significant other and myself truly enjoyed the atmosphere and enjoyed the owner speaking with us and getting to know us. I recommend couples especially, or a couple of friends, to take advantage of the catering options. We ordered the 16 chicken fingers and we had enough leftovers for lunch/dinner. The name, chicken fingers, does not give it justice for the actual size. I recommend this to everyone in town."}
{"text":"First review on Yelp and first time at wing time and let me tell you it's soooo good! We got a 40 piece party pack which was good for 4 of us to share and all the flavored were great! The Taste of Asia had a pho essence and my favorite Lemon Pepper was also so good we also got Garlic Parmesan, Hot and mild as well and they were also tasty. The Texas toast was also buttery goodness and the fries were crispy and salted just right. We will definitely be back here soon!!!"}
{"text":"I am really picky when it comes to wings and chicken tenders. These were very very good! I got tropical habanero tenders and they were sweet with just the right amount of kick. The tenders are huge and two easily filled me up. The combo comes with crinkle fries and Texas toast which were both were perfectly cooked and well seasoned! Customer service was amazing and even the owner came around and checked how we were doing and how the food was. I will be definitely going back in the future."}
{"text":"Why can't we have it all? 

So I loved nearly everything here and a big shout out for creativity! Lots of fun things on the menu and we tasted the peanut butter & jelly finger which was awesome! Very decadent! But...the ranch here is awful. So here are my feelings about ranch -

I like normal ranch. I wouldn't order fingers or wings without it ever, it's a package deal for me. This place offers three different ranches. One of them is just ranch. When I tasted it I thought for sure that they gave me the wrong one. It doesn't taste anything like ranch and was pasty & thick with lots and lots of seasoning. I went up & said I must have the wrong one and the girl just said, nope - that's our regular ranch. Well I hated it and didn't go for more. Luckily the blue cheese & honey mustard saved the meal. Both were very good. But...I would like regular ranch with my tenders. 

We were super bummed. My man said to me, let's just bring ranch with us next time. He liked the food that much as well but didn't want to eat the ranch either. But I'm not going to be the girl who carries ranch in her purse. 

So dear management, please hook up the normal ranch. 

Your sweet potato fries were perfect and the tenders are huge and tossed in some great sauces! We would be regulars if you can work out your ranch situation :)"}
{"text":"Took my hubby out for a lunch date and we decided to try this place out instead of going to raising cane's. I'm glad we did!

The menu offered more items/ combos than I expected it would for a wing place, and was less expensive than others. The gal who took our order was friendly, bright, and genuinely seemed to like where she was, which made me feel welcome. We ordered the 16 finger party tray which came with 3 Texas toasts, generous amount of crinkle fries, 3 large dipping sauces and a choice of flavor for the fingers. The fingers are bigger than those at cane's and are actually gluten free! Very well cooked! Flavorful, tender, and juicy. I also ordered 8 wings tossed in mild sauce, which also came with choice of dipping sauce. These were the best wings we've had in a very long time! Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. No breading either, which was a nice change, and did not get soggy at all.

I loved the mild sauce the best, as it was not runny or oily, and just the right thickness. Honey mustard is good too; sweet and tangy without being over powering. 

The wait time for food was maybe 10-15 minutes, but there were 2 orders ahead of us, so not bad at all, I'd say. The owner talked to us a bit, he's very customer oriented, and the gal who took our order also came to check on us and got my husband a refill on his drink.

TL;DR 
Tried it, loved it! 9/10 would eat here again."}
{"text":"Took 35 minutes for 8 wings to go :(

Most expensive and worst wings I've ever had! Service was just as bad. Employees like to chitchat while you're standing there right in front of them waiting to place your order. You don't even get ranch with your wings that's extra. 
The girl taking my order was filling up dressing cups at the same time and acted like I was bothering her!! I should've walked out."}
{"text":"Celebrate your wonderful wingwoman by taking her on a date, for once. To Wing Time, obviously. Came up here for such an occasion with Neli T, who is a big time wing fan. Our eyes are typically bigger than our stomachs, and our dinner here was no exception.

There's a huge selection of sauces here, available bone-in and boneless. I highly suggest the traditional sort, as the boneless ones we tried were consistently dry and overbattered. As for the sauces, they were hit or miss in that the ones we most looked forward to weren't as good as we'd expected (hot garlic, PBJ) while others that we added on a whim ended up being favorites (Ensenada Enchilada, chimmi churri). Other surprise hits were the buffalo toast and the buffalo mac and cheese (noticing a theme?), while the fried pickles also suffered the same over-battered fate as the boneless wings.

Overall, our experience was solid and I plan to come back to try more flavors. I'll stick exclusively to bone-in wings and suggest that others do the same. Prices are good for what you get and neither of us could finish our combos!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service ever. Placed a order online and i put in for the time at 3:30 and when I put check out it said the food would be done at 4: 30.  So I called asking if I could change the time the lady said no they're is nothing she could do. She said I had to cancel the order and refund it and do it again.  Turns out the website doesn't give you that option of refunding. So how easy would have it been of her to write down my order and change the time. Being the order was place an hour and a half before it was even suppose to be picked up."}
{"text":"Don't come on your lunch break . Took way too long. I have to go back to work and my food just came . Food was messed up . Disappointed . Probably won't come back"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend today and ordered the wings and fingers combo which includes a drink 2 chicken fingers with one choice of flavor 6 wings with 2 flavor choices Texas toast, and fries. I ordered the lemon pepper chicken fingers and the tropical habanero and garlic parmesan wings. 

To start all of the chicken and fries were fried to perfection.  The batter on the fingers was amazing and does not have that greasy residue that most battered chicken have. 
The Texas toast was heavy in butter and toasted very very light but it was still delicious. 
Lemon pepper rub was the best one out of the three flavors that I had, the tropical habanero was a smudge too sweet and needed a little more heat.  There wasn't enough garlic parmesan on the other pieces so Im not sure how it tasted. 

they have a peanut butter and jelly rub... Yes real peanut butter and real jelly which was really good! 
 

The owners and staff were amazing... There was quite a few people in there and they got every order out promptly
The atmosphere is very chill. 
They update their rubs and sauces frequently so it's always something different.
everything is cooked made to order and taste fresh. 
All the dipping sauces are made in house (I'm not really a ranch eater and I found myself liking it.)
It's a great spot to go to and I will return when in the area!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! Called in for an order and the rep told me she was going to put me a quick hold, i was on hold for over 5 minutes. I hung up and called back and they picked up the phone and hung up so i called back and she put me on hold again!

Never again will I order from here. I only do it because it's the closest wing establishment near me. I guess it's back to Wingstop"}
{"text":"What an awesome wing place! Right around the corner where I live and the price is great for what you get! Combos come with fries, toast, dip, and a drink! Great selection of dips/sides etc. Workers had great customer service! Met the owner lance, what a very humble owner making sure all of his customers are satisfied! Wingtime is now my favorite wing place to go to! Hands down!!"}
{"text":"When I head to a new part of town and it's lunch time... I've gotta pull out Yelp and see what I dan find. Well, all I can say is I found a gem today. Wing Time is one of the best meals for the price I've had in ages. Everything was fresh and exploding with flavor. Feel like taking a risk? Try the PB&J specialty flavor! Or... try anything with the honey Sriracha dipping sauce - so good! Honesty, I'll have to come back to try more because there were just too many flavors to cover in one visit. The owner was extremely helpful, patient, and very knowledgeable about his menu. If you have a flavor you're after, he'll lead you the right way! Do yourself a favor and check out WingTime out! 5 Stars."}
{"text":"I am very picky on wings and found a lot of places disappointment, but not here!!! They have the best wings. So many favors to choose from and the staff is always so friendly. Every time me and my family go in the owner is always there smiling and interacting with the customers. A very friendly environment and amazing food."}
{"text":"Great selection of food flavors. A tiny bit pricy but comperable to other business. Delicious wings and homelike sides."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat! Service is great! They definitely have my new favorite wing flavor Louie n Anna a cajun dry rub that's delicious! The manager has a great personality and tries to interact with every guest that comes in which really makes the experience. After eating here a few times it's now a place I visit regularly and look forward to."}
{"text":"I usually don't like wings but this place was \"everything\" the lemon pepper was so good and the mild is - mild . I love the toast too. The employees are SO nice!! The chicken was cooked the way I like , crunchy and large pieces too! Will keep going back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time at lunch today. Holy cow!! There was only one employee working, running the counter and fixing and packaging the food, all while having a *itch with a mouth the size of Texas yelling at him. The female manager did not seem to want to bother herself by helping him. I waited about 25 minutes from ordering to receiving my food to take care of \"the mouth\" and then fix my sandwich. The chicken sandwich was on Texas toast with a small chicken tender inside about half the size of the slice of bread. Some overdone crinkle cut fries and a soft drink. The soft drink was the best item there. My first trip was my last trip."}
{"text":"Wings are the boyfriend's all time favorite food and I like them too, so we go into different wing places with semi-high expectations.

The wings are good. I had the fingers which were also good. We got mild, lemon pepper, and garlic Parmesan all which were flavored very nicely. The fries were decent. My Texas toast was way too buttery but the boyfriends wasn't so that sucked for me lol. 

What sucked more than my butter-drenched toast was the cashier. She was a younger girl who looked like she would rather be any place in the world on a Sunday afternoon than at her job. When we ordered her friendliness was on zero. Even though nobody was behind us she seemed super impatient with the fact that we were first timers reading the menu and deciding what we wanted . I shrugged it off on her having a bad day, but it seems like she just didn't like us. She was super nice and friendly to every one who walked in after us. Maybe because they knew what they wanted right away? So yeah guys be prepared with your order or be prepared to be death stared at ! 

The guy who came through cleaning tables and refilling drinks was very sweet and made up for his coworker. 

I almost want to give it 4 stars, but I'm really intolerant of crappy customer service. If you don't really care about that then definitely stop by for some pretty good wings at a decent price. I'm still on the hunt for a wing place with balance of good food and good service."}
{"text":"Update - since the visit that prompted my one star review, the business owner, Michael, reached out to me personally to apologize for the situation. Michael took care of me after the fact, and I can appreciate a local business trying to do right by its customers. Food was great, and due to the owner's prompt action, I am more than willing to come back. 

Unfortunately, I'm writing this as I stand here, waiting for more than an hour for an order. While this ksnt the staffs fault entirely (they are sorely under staffed for a Friday evening), it is irksome none the less. The actual product is above average as far as wings go, but the wait time (which wouldn't have been an issue if we had been told an appropriate amount of time at the offset) will deter me from returning."}
{"text":"I am a huge wing lover and this place made not only me happy but my husband too who isnt a big wing fan (he said its better than wingstop and I agree!!) the wings were meaty, loved the flavor selection, and omggggg the texas toast!! Besides that the customer service was really good and loved the decor and cleanliness!! This is officially my favorite place!!! Im not overly critical.. if the customer service is good , the food is yummy, and its not expensive im there!! Loved this place and will definitely become a regular!!"}
{"text":"We had visited this restaurant twice before, and enjoyed it. However, when we stopped in today, we didn't even stay to order. When we arrived, the server at the counter was finishing taking another group's order. She finished, told us she would be right with us, and we said, \"Okay.\" 

She then proceeded to fix the drinks for the group before us, and served them. That was fine with us.

What was not fine was when, after serving the drinks, instead of coming back to the counter where we were waiting to order, she stopped by another table and asked if they needed anything else. One of the people there looked around their table, picked up his drink cup, and handed it to her. That was the point at which we turned and walked out.

I don't mind waiting my turn at a restaurant. I don't mind if people who have been waiting before me get served first. I do mind when the server literally looks around for anyone else to help before she comes back to me. For a restaurant that serves chicken wings, the food isn't bad, but it's not worth my feeling unwelcome or dismissed. We are not planning on returning any time in the foreseeable future.

Edited to add: Since posting my original review, the owner of the restaurant promptly contacted me, offering to correct the problem and offering us a gift card to make up for the experience. So, despite our frustration, at least they were responsive, and we are certainly willing to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"This place was barely worth it before. Now after their huge price hike, it's not worth it at all. Who charges $3 for Texas toast, and $1 per ranch cup? Buffalo wild wings is even cheaper. At least they have a lot better wings."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and food is great.  I like the French fried and lemon pepper chicken wings."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great customer service. Garlic Parmesan, mild chicken and salt n vinegar. Salt and n vinegar needs more salt n vinegar rub. Every thing else is awesome."}
{"text":"Loved everything we ordered!  Wings, chicken fingers, regular fries, maple cinnamon sweet potato fries, and Texas toast...all delicious and cooked perfectly!  Excellent service as well!"}
{"text":"Best wings, customer service is always on point , last time we walked 10 minutes before closing and they still treated us well and wings are delicious"}
{"text":"Customer service was just mediocre. I was greeted and helped as soon as I walked in. The guy who helped ring me up was extremely nice. 

On to the food... We ordered the following :

Hot garlic - I love garlic, but this didn't have much of a garlic flavor to it. There was a subtle garlic flavor instead. It was not spicy at all! 

Red rooster- it had hot cheeto crumbs on them, which was different and I loved it ; just wish there was a bit more on the wings. The flavor was good. I would have to say this was the best out of the 3 different wing flavors we got. Not spicy at all. 

Hot- these were a disappointment. In the menu it stated that it had hot cheeto crumbs, but there wasn't even a spec of crumb on them, just buffalo sauce. The flavor was just OK. Not spicy. This one was made a bit dryer than the others. Wish they would put more sauce on them. 

A MAJOR minus is a safety issue! The floors are REALLY slippery. It's concrete, but has a glossy finish to them. I was wearing running shoes with grips at the bottom and still managed to slip! I didn't fall, but I had to be extra careful walking on the floors! It was extra slippery near the cash register and more so towards the back of the store. The floors looked greasy; don't know from what, but just be cautious!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly atmosphere and delicious food. Every time I come in, I am welcomed and the employees are happy to see us! The food is always fresh and these prices you cannot beat. They make their own ranch and it's so good...don't even get me started on their Texas toast! I look forward to coming here every time."}
{"text":"Great wings, creative sauces, inventive dips, fresh fresh food and the prices are much better than other wing competitors. The service was awesome. We were shocked a small joint provided such attentive service while dining in. They just added boneless wings which are smaller than the chicken fingers and they were great and were meaty and not all breading unlike another wing giant COUGH Bdubs COUGH. I recommend the Carolina Bbq and Tropical habanero (not just sweet but actually spicy) and the honey siracha or hickory ranch for your dips. This place breaks out of the mold and you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Update:
It was my understanding that the 1st time I tried the wings here, the cook was in training. So today we went in at 11am and ordered a dozen of the PB&J wings which we really enjoyed last time and 7 PB&J fingers. We also got 6 Hot Garlic and 6 Red Rooster. This was the first time we tried the fingers and let me tell you these were a really generous size. 2 fingers and we were full! Therefore the wing would have to wait till dinner time. The PB & J wings were delicious. The red rooster were like an Asian sweet red Chile. Very good as well and the Hot Garlic are good and spicy but for my taste lacked garlic flavor. However, I am Cuban and have an incredible love of garlic in everything so that might just be me. :)
Anyway, I am very happy we went and tried it again. My whole family LOVES the PB&J flavor and there are still a few other flavors I would like to try. My husband reported that the two young men working were very friendly and polite as well which is another reason we will return."}
{"text":"First time here courtesy of Yelp Elite event.  I must say this place is bomb.com! I ordered the wing and finger combo with fries, Texas toast (big piece), and a drink.  With this combo you have 1 flavor, and the wings you have 2 flavors to choose from.  I had the PB&J fingers, I  actually liked this flavor. It wasn't too  sweet, it's a flavor everyone should try. The batter on the fingers are the best I've had! It was very crunchy, I believe they said they used chips in the batter.  For the wings I had lemon pepper and Lou and Ana. The chicken was seasoned very well and fried crispy. The Lou and Ana flavor had a kick to it. The lemon pepper was awesome! The owners and the staff were very friendly, professional, and informative. There's a ton of flavors and rubs to try.  I most definitely recommend coming here! I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"My order got messed up. The owner was a real stand up guy. He not only made it right but went way beyond. The food is great. He's got my business, hands down. There's a lot to be said for a place that has a great product AND accepts full responsibility when things don't go as planned. It's called integrity, and more local businesses should exhibit it like Wing Time does."}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise find. My wife and I enjoyed the portions and the great food. Also Lance one of the owners and the rest of the staff was great. Can't wait to try out new flavors next time."}
{"text":"First time here & this place gets 5 stars from me I ordered chicken fingers with sweet potato fries while my bf ordered chicken wings with reg fries when I say the food here is amazing from the chicken to fires and the toast. It was so yummy I told my bf I forgot to order my wings well done but when the food arrived everything was cooked to perfection. Needless to say this place has the best WINGS in town. With a lot of flavor options so there is a choice for everyone if your indecisive abt trying this place you don't have to think twice . I will def be back soon"}
{"text":"This place is so good! The wings are so great and delicious. The staff is so nice. The manager lance always makes sure everything is going well for you. He really engages with his customer. It was great customer service. Love it here! I'll back again."}
{"text":"I've eaten many wings in Las Vegas over the years. This is absolutely the best I've ever had. I will exclusively come here for my wings now. The chicken is cooked very thorough and is incredibly tender. The sauces are the best I've ever had. It puts Buffalo Wild Wings sauces to shame. The owner Lance is awesome. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Ordered online at 2:30 pm for pick up at 4:00 pm. Got to the place at 4:05 and my food was still not ready. I don't mind waiting sometimes, but I had to wait til 4:30 just to get my food when they had an hour and a half to prepare it already. No idea if it's good since I just used my entire lunch break waiting and have no time to eat it. What's the point of ordering online if I still have to wait?"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for awhile and I'm glad we did. Danae has exceptional customer service, and helped us figure out the menu. So we ordered a 20 of boneless wings, large fries, Texas toast and 3 sauces. We tried 4 different types of wings Cajun, lemon pepper, bbq and medium buffalo. Let me tell you the food was delicious, fries were yummy and the wings were freaking huge.

The boneless wings are seriously like mini chicken tenders. We only ate 8 of them between the two of us. They are like this size of tennis balls just a lil flattened out. Super yummy though. And they are breaded in potato chips instead of normal four. They have a lil crunch to them but are very delicious. But they also make the flour ones as well you just have to request it. 

For two Adults, we only ate 8 wings lol so a family of four would be fine with a 20 piece. My eyes are bigger than my stomach but trust me 4 per person was enough with fries. 

Everything is priced great here. They give you huge portions for the food you order. And I love that. This place puts wing stop and Buffalo Wild Wings to shame. Try it out and I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was okay I must say friendly staff and them lemon pepper wings was, on point great place to stop before going to the DMV"}
{"text":"Great wings. Great flavor selection. The peanut butter and jelly was great! A must try! Servings are good portions. Service was great and owner was nice and friendly.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a very good lunch. The fingers are very good and big.  I'd say the three piece meal would be enough for most. They have a nice selection of spin sauces and dips. I enjoyed the Teriyaki and the Cajun with the southwest ranch sauce. The meal comes with a fries, drink, and garlic toast. I'll be back and recommend it to anyone who like wing and fingers."}
{"text":"Well, I can't speak to the quality of the food... I was really looking forward to trying a new place.  We waited in line to order and the cashier (my receipt says it was Lesha) barely looked up.  Since you can get two different sauces for 8 or 12, I asked if you could get 4 flavors on 30 wings.  \"No we can't\" ummmm okay.  I continue to order with 3 flavors as well as a kids meal and two sides.  I ordered 3 waters...bill comes out to $48.  Seems a bit steep, but it's our first time and I still want to try Wingtime.  I get my receipt and see I'm charged $2.79 per water.  When I question it, the cashier again barely looks up and mumbles that \"I have to charge you for a cup.\" I asked what size water is free and she again reiterates that there is a charge.  At that point, I've had enough.  Cashier sighs, calls for a manager, and he then comes out and says nothing.  We get a refund and head across the street to another wing restaurant.  In a town with so many options for food it's a shame that the service is so lacking here.

**Edited to add that the owner reached out to me last night; it sounds like my experience was definitely not the norm.  I truly appreciate small businesses and especially when owners are responsive to feedback.  We're going to give it another shot.  To be continued...

***Edited again.  We returned to Wingtime after a few weeks later, and I'm so glad we did.  I seriously couldn't believe it was the same place.  The cashier/server was very friendly and helpful.  The service was prompt, attentive, and the food was excellent.  The wings were crispy and cooked as wings should be.  The sauces (Cajun, salt & vinegar, and medium) were very good and it wasn't sauce overkill.  Our kids had chicken tenders, and both said those were great, too.  They were large, filling, and the portion was great for kids.  A big thank you to the owner for reaching out; I really appreciate the gesture and I don't know that we would've come back had he not done that.  We'll definitely be back again, though!"}
{"text":"Probably the best wings and chicken fingers I've ever had. The chicken fingers are perfectly crispy. They have a ton of different flavors that you can add to everything. Things as wild as peanut butter and jelly. The owner is extremely friendly and the service was great. Definitely coming back here! Please open a location in Downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"WingTime is really great because they have multiple wing flavors that are unique to them plus the food is always freshly made.  However, make sure when you go there to always make sure that they gave you the correct amount of sauces.  I've been here at least 8 times and they always forgot either to give me the extra sauces that I paid for or they flat out don't give me any."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable! The design the cleanliness the staff the owner the food \"ALL ON POINT!\" That louie and anna sauce is unlike anything I've ever had and have craved it since me and my daughter stopped in! Along with the salt and vinigar dry rub I live for! The texas toast, would be on my tray at my last meal! It's been over a week and I need to make it back! I should have listened when the owner said,\"I'll see ya tomorrow!\"... Yes my friend! I WILL see you tomorrow! Get your tummies in here and try this food you'll come in a stranger and leave as part of a family, you'll see what I mean when you do."}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break since they had just recently opened for lunch time. Got the 10 pc traditional wing combo came with toast, crinkle fries and a drink at a very decent price. I got half mild and half lemon pepper with ranch on the side. Food was very good and well seasoned. Great selection of dips and flavors. Received excellent service from the workers and I will be coming back for lunch again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Best wings hands down I've ever had!! Who thinks to put strawberry and chicken together?!! Geniuses, that's who!!! And Trisha was the best waitress!! So nice, funny and of course attentive!! I will absolutely be back every time I'm in vegas! A must have treat! Oh and FRIED PEACH COBBLER... mic drop.."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on Tuesday evening. It's your typical chicken joint. Just like wing stop is the best I would compare it too. A bit pricey, with flavors that make you believe otherwise when you receive them. For example Parmesan garlic was perhaps a garlic base with grated parmesan cheese on it or even a mild sauce. I would think it's a family owned business? The cashier was very patient and helpful upon ordering. You can try any sauce you'd like first before ordering. We had twenty wings split with three sauces. Macaroni and cheese with Texas toast. Oh and don't forget the fries! The macaroni looked as if it were sitting all day long, but taste okay no major wow factor. The wings were pretty big and greasy.  Long story short, glad we tried it but most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! The service was great and I could take a bath in their ranch dip. Their chicken fingers rolled in ruffles potato chips are out of this world. My kids love this place. I will definitely be back again. Oh yeah, the Texas toast, to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna preface this by saying I'm not a wing guy. Not a huge fan of B-Dubs. These wings were amazing though. I mostly got them for my wife to try cause she loves wings and each order comes with multiple flavors so I figured I'd try some garlic parm wings. They were spectacular. Great flavor, super juicy, and real good meat to bone ratio. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Lots of choices!! And they all sound yummy!! I ordered the red rooster and lemon pepper which was a good choice. The young guy up front was even nice enough to let me try some of the other flavors. One of them caught my attention.  The Cajun butter taste just like boiling crabs sauce. I just love all the unique flavors and the dipping sauces were great!! It was finger licking good!! If you're up north stop by and try it yourself. You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last weekend for a Yelp Event and we can't stop thinking about their wings and fries! Upon entering, we were greeted and welcomed right away. The owners explained their menu and the different flavors they have for the wings. We ended up ordering the Fingers and Wings combo. With this combo, we were able to choose 3 different flavors. This combo also came with fries, toast, and a drink. All for $11.99! Definitely one of the best deals I've seen.

Between my husband and I, we got the flavors: mild, bbq, lemon pepper, teriyaki, and garlic parmesan. My favorite was the mild, teriyaki, and lemon pepper. They were so good, I couldn't just pick one. Their wings were awesome. I was a little hesitant ordering the tenders at first because I'm not a huge fan of them. Boy am I glad I ordered them! These tenders were bigger than your average tender. They were also still crispy even with the mild flavoring I ordered it with. Honestly, I ended up loving the tenders more! They were breaded just right! Most places have too much breading and too much sauce. Not Wing Time! Their fries were also one of the best that I have had. They were sooo good! Man, I hope they open another location in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Really like the variety of sauces and the wings were nice and fresh.  This is a place where you will see the owner.  He truly cares about serving great food with a personal touch.  Check this place our you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this place like 5 times already. Best wings !!! Great service , good prices and all food is cooked to order, the ranch is house made everyday. They have party platters that give you the best bang for your buck. This place is clean and friendly . Whenever we have ordered to go, our food was always ready and we did not have to wait . Def a plus !!!!"}
{"text":"Really good service. Was craving buffalo fries, which I've only had in San Diego, and they had something similar to it. Doesn't compare to Epic Wings, but it was still very tasteful. Brother and sister in law ordered tenders and looked pretty good as well. Love the crinkle fries!"}
{"text":"Tried this place twice and so far I have to say it's very good. The strips have a ton of meat in them.

Food:
Peanut butter jelly wings: 4/5
Garlic parmesan:               4/5
Regular fries:                     3/5
Texas toast:                       4/5

Now, the peanut butter and jelly wings are very good to me. I have also had a lot of different people try them and they did not like them."}
{"text":"This place sucks bad customer service had to repeat my self 4 times because the lady taken my order wasn't paying attention then they took about 30 mins to bring out my order and when it came it was all wrong and cold and one of my orders was undercooked and still had a lil blood on the inside of the chicken tender and when I confronted the manager she told my lil brother it was his fault the food was cold cuz he dipped in the sauce which I thought was bullshit and I asked for a full refund and they rudely took all the food and I asked when I will get my money back on my card she said does not know ask the bank I think this place is trash and now I know why it was empty when we got there"}
{"text":"Wings and fries were surprisingly awesome.  We loved everything, even down to the ranch.  We're so glad the previous wing restaurant was replaced by Wing Time.  We will definitely be back.  The owner's dancing and the friendliness of the rest of the staff surely added to our great experience.  Our new wing spot...and it's right down the street from our house.  #winner"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today for the first time, but it won't be the last!  GREAT food and service.  I had the Caesar salad with BBQ chicken.  It was spectacular!  Hot, crispy chicken (which tasted delish) over a crispy salad with home-made croutons.  I highly recommend this place!  The manager was extremely friendly and was conscientious and spoke with every customer.  Thanks!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Updated Review 2/5/17

We preordered a party pack of wings for super bowl Sunday on the Saturday before the big game for a 2:30pm pickup. We got to the store at 2:20pm and did not receive our order until 3:15pm.

During the whole time we were waiting in the restaurant, we watched several people leave angry and ask for refunds. The customer service was incredibly disappointing, not once did they offer an update on the status of our order or apologize for the delay. We asked for an update after 40 minutes, and we were told 10 more minutes...obviously that wasn't true. Don't get me wrong, it's a busy day, but at least apologize and give us update along the way, or offer us a drink for goodness sake. An additional hour wait is unacceptable.

Because of this our super bowl party did not start on time and we missed kickoff. The food was still good, but the poor service won't make us rush back in. 

----------------
This place is everything you love about franchise chicken places without everything you hate about franchises. A truly refreshing chicken concept.

The girls upfront were so incredibly kind and helped  my boyfriend and i pick out wing flavors. We ended up getting the pbj based off their recommendation and it was absolutely delicious.

We will definitely go back for the service and the food. Our only request is to add beer to the menu!"}
{"text":"4/21/2018   I was in the mood for Chicken Wings and saw the reviews for Wing Time on North Decatur and thought I'd give them a try.  Glad I did.  
They will provide small samples of the sauces to try before you order.  None of the sauces I tried were too hot and quite good.  I ordered  the combo platter (10 piece) with 3 different types of wings.  I chose the Mango  Habanero, Berry Hot, and Cajun style/ with fries, Texas Toast and  drink.  I ordered them with half  \"bone in\" & half \"boneless\".  The boneless were about the size of a golf ball. They also gave me some Honey Sriracha  dipping sauce. My order came out in a reasonable time and brought to my table.  I enjoyed all 3 types of wings but I would tell them to go easy on the sauce as the Berry Hot was drenched in too much sauce.  All the other wings were great. The Texas Toast was excellent and the fries were cooked perfectly.  I ate all but one wing as I was full.  My drink order was refilled 3 times and the ice in it was the kind you like to crunch on.  The place was clean and had seating for about 30 people.  I would highly recommend giving this place a try and I would suggest to be adventurous and try several different sauces.  My bill was a reasonable $13.00 and change and I would eat at this establishment again."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in to Wingtime tonight. We tried the lemon pepper and garlic parmesan wings.  These weren't skimpy wings, they were a nice, substantial size and they were seasoned perfectly.  The food came out fresh and steaming. The ranch, blue cheese and chipotle honey sauces should be sold by the jar.  The crinkle cut fries and Texas toast are included in the combo, so good! The girls at the counter were patient and helpful while we took a little time to figure out our order since it was our first time.  The owner was a joy to talk to, we'll definitely be back to try some of the other wing flavors and menu items!"}
{"text":"You know what my problem with Las Vegas is? There just ain't no good wing spots out here. I know, I know what you're gonna say:

\"But B-dubs, Hooters and Wing Stop are good Ray!\" 

And if you honestly believe that stop reading my reviews because when it comes to wings I'm an enthusiast and baby, we just don't see eye to eye. [Pro-Tip: SmokeEaters back in San Jose, California are still my all time favorite wings. So get on my level]

Anyhoo, Wing Time is my favorite wing place in the Aliante area. Can't say they're the best in Vegas but once I try all Vegas wing spots I'll let ya know. So far they are my go to spot. So that's saying something. 

Wing Stop's shtick is their many flavors. And usually that's a sign that your wings aren't great. Can't master one so get good at many. Not true here. Sure there are some I don't care for but the classic flavors are pretty darn tasty.

Note to reader: I've only tried their hot buffalo, lemon pepper, BBQ and red rooster so I can only opine on those. 

Their hot buffalo are tasty. But the heat leaves much to be desired. Still, this flavor has been my standard every time I come through. Maybe next time I'll get their ghost pepper wing. See if that's hot enough for me.

The lemon pepper wings were very overpowering with the taste of both lemon and pepper. I'll admit I'm not a fan of lemon pepper wings so maybe that's why I wasn't much of a fan of these either.

BBQ are awesome. The sauce is sweet and tangy and they drench your wings in it. Yum!

Red Rooster. This is one of those flavors that's supposed to be cool but just misses the mark with me. It's supposed to be a wing coated with ginger and hot Cheeto crumbs. It was ok but I could barely taste the cheeto and tasted more of the ginger. I'll pass next time.

If you go in person expect a wait. The orders are made fresh and the sitting area is small. Luckily you can order online and stop by to pick it up. I recommend doing that. 

Also, if you prefer their chicken fingers are just as good as their wings."}
{"text":"I just want to say they're truly amazing. 
Very good wings. 
I'm picky of tenders but theirs to die for. 
Fries are way better then wingstop etc. 
Very nice workers. 
I hope this place gets more known. 
Thanks Mike and Lance for helping me and being there for my dad also."}
{"text":"Been buying wings here for awhile now. Their wing quality is spot on, big and juicy wings. The seasonings are interesting and exotic. Nice change from Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"The customer service here was immaculate. Workers were super friendly and welcoming and the food was made in a timely manner and was delicious. Super visor Juan took care of me and my family very well, even though we came in near closing time. His up to par people skills were very refreshing as most establishments lack that basic quality amongst employees now a days. Recommend this location for sure! First time here and we will be back !"}
{"text":"I love wings... this IS my new place to go for wings. Very very tasty flavors... chicken, sides and Texas toast was could perfectly. Owner is super friendly. I'll definitely be coming back anytime I'm craving some wings. WOW! Just try it; I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stop in to try this place out. The food was cold when we first got it and had to send it back to get reheated. We got the mozzarella sticks which tasted better after we sent them back but getting them back they was a little burnt. The buffalo chicken fries was pretty good but the chicken wrap wasn't that good & if I could I wouldn't order it again. Overall this place was below average, will I come back to eat no, will I refer a friend to try it out no. Even the cook that came to the front looked so unprofessional, shirt was all ripped up with holes. I really hope that this place do read their reviews and try to do better or do a Secret pop up to see how their business is ran."}
{"text":"Best wings in the greater Las Vegas area. LARGE wings served in fantastic flavors with great beer pairings. The staff is very friendly and attentitive. My first stop whenever I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"When we came in we didn't know what we wanted or what flavors to try. We were allowed to sample the berry hot. We ordered wings and were going to take out, but we decided to dine. I got 20 wings. Berry hot, ghost peppered, & lemon pepper traditional bone in wings. My daughter got the hot buffalo wings. It took the wings about 15mins to finish. So they were fresh. My daughter loved the garlic bread that came w/her kids meal. None of the wings we got had a huge spice kick to it. Even my daughter kept saying these wings aren't spicy! So I'd like to see what the hotter sauces do. Berry hot was like a spicy mild sauce. The ghost peppered wings were a dry rub and it really bland. Service was good too. No complaints there."}
{"text":"I'm not one of those Yelpers that will give 2 Stars or 5 Stars to a restaurant after just one visit.  If I have a 5 Star experience, I am almost always trying the business again before reviewing them.  If I have an experience with 2 or less Stars, I'm either not wasting my time with a review or I'm trying them again before reviewing them.  I'm also not one of those Yelpers that give a negative or very positive review just to be contrary.  That being said, Wingtime is hot, new, and already has a 5 Star Yelp average.  I have to admit, I was very skeptical about the ratings.  Really, they have a 5 Stars average already?  It's just chicken wings, right??  Then I found out for myself why this place has such a huge fan base from the neighborhood locals.  First off, their chicken wings are fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order.  Secondly, their wings have a lot of meat on them.  Substance is a huge deal to me when it comes to food in general, including wings.  I prefer a wing with more meat, less breading, and ironically, no flavors.  I don't need a wing drowned in flavors to hide a skinny, meatless, and tasteless chicken.  The wings at Wingtime are so good that their flavors and rubs are really not necessary. But if you must know, Wingtime has at least 14 different flavors to season your wings.  I tried their Peanut Butter & Jelly Time Wing, which is crazy good if you're a peanut butter lover.  Their garlic parmesan is actually my favorite and I recommend it.  Wings and chicken fingers can be purchased by themselves or in a combo.  I recommend the Fingers N Wings Combo for $11.59 if you're undecided or a first timer.  This combo includes two chicken fingers, 6 wings (2 flavors), choice of fries, Texas toast, and a drink.  This meal comes with so much that it's good enough to feed two.  I have also tried their grilled and crispy chicken sandwiches.  Both are not currently on their permanent menu, but will be soon.  The grilled chicken sandwich is really good, fresh, and is about 6 oz. of chicken breast.  In my opinion, you really can't go wrong with either their wings or the grilled chicken sandwich. 

The restaurant is very clean and service is top notch.  Don't be surprised if every single employee, including the owner Lance, acknowledges you, greets you, and checks up on you.  I also warn you that Wingtime is very busy and there's usually a long wait for their delicious wings.  They get a lot of phone orders, take-out, and people dining in.  Keep in mind that Wingtime is not fast food and everything is cooked to order, not sitting under a lamp.  I know this and will call in my order if I don't have the time to hang out.  

Overall, I highly recommend Wingtime to all wing lovers out there. Their wings are plump, never frozen, and cooked to order. Wingtime has at least 14 different flavors to choose from, which make them the overall \"King of Wing\" in the area.  5 Star Yelp Average???  I question that no more.  5 Stars from me as well. 

TIP #1:  Be patient or call in your order.  Wingtime has become a local favorite and it's busy. 

TIP #2:  14 different flavors, including specialties like their peanut butter & jelly, Ensenada Chilada, Berry Hot, Orange U Happy, and the very hot Ghost of Habanero.  

TIP #3:  Located a couple of footsteps from Salted Malted

TIP #4:  Wings by the piece start at $7.99 for 8. Chicken Fingers by the pieced start at $6.99 for 4.  NOTE: Each finger is about 2 oz. of meat, 1 oz. of batter. 

TIP #5:  Combos start at $9.29 and come with wings/chicken fingers, fries, Texas toast, and a drink."}
{"text":"The food was Bomb and th owner and ladiez at th counter gave Excellent Service! Idk what they put in their ranch bt OmGee! This was Perfect for Lunch! We all ordered something different so we could try ad much as possible. I got Sweet Potato fries ii swear these are the Best! 5 starz All th way Around!"}
{"text":"Great wings and amazing service. We tried Wingtime for the first time and it was great. The wings and fingers are cooked to order. The Texas toast tastes like heaven. I love the crinkle cut fries. The sauces are really flavorful. The combos and catering prices are reasonable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went recently and we had an excellent experience. Julio was amazing and gave superb service to all patrons... the food was fresh and really good as well!! We will be returning soon-"}
{"text":"Been coming here every week or two, for several months now. Haven't found a better wing joint in the city, and I don't think I will. I've tried nearly all the sauces, and everything is great. Hoover Dam Hot is excruciatingly hot, but the flavor is worth the pain. It's probably my favorite. My go-to is still the three finger combo, but the bone-in wings are also meaty and cooked to perfection. The house made dipping sauces are a breath of fresh air, considering most places use pre-made and powdered nonsense. Service is fantastic, and the staff are the friendliest. I hope these guys open more locations. They're the absolute best."}
{"text":"Kirsten was very helpful. Helped me picked through interesting choice of flavors for my wings. I got the red rooster, peanut butter jelly time, ensenada enchilada, and the mojave heat with buffalo style mac and chesse and toast. They were all fire. especially the watermelon drink."}
{"text":"These are honestly the best wings I've had and the fries were soooo good It's a must while in Vegas! They have 80 flavors to choose from i regret not buying some sauce to take home."}
{"text":"When we went the person at the counter (may be the owner) was very very friendly and inviting. It is a cute place. I got the chicken fingers and couldn't believe how large they were. They have a different taste than most other chicken fingers I've tasted and I'm quite unsure what to think of it. The wings were pretty good and the Texas toast was good as well. I'd have to try them again"}
{"text":"My husband bought buffalo style and garlic parmigiana wings. The taste was great. Problem? They were not cooked all the way through. I told my husband they weren't cooked properly and I through mine out. My stubborn husband felt they were \" fine\" and kept eating and wound up sick through the night and next morning. So, he was the stupid one here, but that being said, Wing Time needs to teach its employees about raw chicken and the effects it has on the human digestive system!"}
{"text":"First time ever visited after Yelp recommend.  Fantastic place. Very clean, very specious and comfortable. Received warm welcome from staff and owner. Recommended on their \"secret sauce\" with my wings. You have to be HUNGRY and bring big apatite with you. Wings were warm and super crispy from outside and equally juice from inside.  Their frys was outstanding with great soft yet crisp layer.  Wings I got were Lemon Paper and with Cajun rub (sorry forgot the name) - outstanding flavors.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Would definitely recommend to friends and family.  Also they do catering for events....so would be calling then soon..."}
{"text":"Don't understand the bad reviews by Amber M & Ania K? Don't forget girls, this is a fast casual chicken wing & tender joint, everything freshly made to order. it's an insult to compare this place with Wing Stop or any other mass produced fast food chain. I ordered the combo with 5 tenders with habanero and garlic parmesan sauces I think? And boy was it amazing? It was thick and full of flavor, and the home made ranch I could just drink it, the toast with a perfect crust, and crispy french fries. Too bad I live in Spring Valley, otherwise I'd be at this place every week. Wingtime, thank you for not using cheap ingredients..."}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with this place! Gluten free wings, fingers, onion rings...make sure to try the pbj wing sauce-sounds odd, tastes great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love wings. I had seen that this place had so many good reviews i just HAD to try it. 
Let me tell you these wings were out of this world! 
First off, when we enter the place it has a low key type of vibe, its clean, and customers seem happy. Already off to a good start. 
When we reach the registers where you order we were greeted with a smile and a friendly attitude. The employee was very helpful and I appreciate that because i'm a very indecicive person!so that was another gold star. My boyfriend and I ordered a bunch of wings, in total two combo orders. We got cajun, lemon pepper, bbq, and \"louis n ana\". The combos come with 2 flavors of wings, fries, texas toast and a drink.
So okay- I am not joking when I say these were AMAZING. We were blown away! 
10/10 for the fries. Perfect crispy golden potatoes. I got a honey mustard dipping sauce that i used for them and it was sooo good. 
10/10 for the lemon pepper wings. They were perfectly seasoned, perfectly crisp, amazingly amazing, like... amazing. 
10/10 for the Louis N Ana wings. These are probably our top favorite. Again perfect crisp, seasoned goodness. I'm not sure how else to describe them. So perfect.
9/10 for the Cajun wings. These were good, perfect crisp n all, but it was a little disappointing it was just basic buffalo sauce and cajun seasoning. Either way, we still liked them and you can never go wrong with cajun!
9/10 for the bbq wings. You honestly can't go wrong with bbq. Its a classic. The only reason it's not 10 stars is because they arent crispy. I love my crispy wings. Other than that, they're great. 

Basically, this place is great. I loved the service, how attentive the employees are, the food and all its perfection. I highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great wings and great service I will definitely be back . I ordered the lemon pepper wings which were even better than wing stop !! Everything was great I'm impressed"}
{"text":"I never comment but I have to say this place has a great food, atmosphere, and customer service! I ordered the chicken finger combo, you definitely get your money's worth! They fingers were huge, lots of fries, Texas toast, and a drink. The fingers were moist and had great flavor!! The owner, staff, and myself carried on a conversation about the football game that was playing while explaining options about which wings to try and how the came up with the flavors! I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. Ordered the family meal and all of the wings were soggy and had hardly any sauce."}
{"text":"I ordered here on grubhub for the 3rd time. The first 2 orders were nothing short of awesome l, but today's was a bit disappointing. The chicken had a weird rubbery texture, almost like taking a bite out of a bouncy ball. My buffalo fries were amazing, but I couldn't eat the oddly textured wings. Definitely not bad enough I never est there again, and I'll probably adjust my rating on my next order cause I'm sure it'll be awesome again."}
{"text":"I go here about once a week.  The service is excellent and the food is even better.  Garlic parmesan, lemon pepper and all the sauces are good.  I love the texas toast too."}
{"text":"This is the best chicken in town! All ingredients are fresh. Tastes great and the service was the best. Had fingers with teriyaki and fries and if you like blue cheese their is the bomb."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere. Fun chicken mantras posted inside. The menu is catchy, prices very reasonable. The staff was extremely friendly with great suggestions. The boneless wing sizes were enormous. Ample parking and seating."}
{"text":"What a great find! Owner was very welcoming and the food was super yummy. The fries, many different flavors and the mac n cheese were delicious. There are so many unique flavors too if you want to be adventurous!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for wings. The flavors are great. The chicken cooked nice and crispy. The sauces and dips are flavorful. I really like that it's also convenient to order online and pick up when I'm ready. The people are friendly and professional."}
{"text":"When I walked inside the door and saw  all the Upscale Interior,  the great colors and the aroma I knew I found something unique. The very attentive staff the flavor profile the unique flavors definitely baby feel as if this is the place and I want to come back to. The most unique peanut butter and jelly flavored Wing that really got my attention, the Texas toast,  the fresh crinkle cut fries, the sweet tea,  the right size portions and the overall atmosphere definitely lets me know this place will be around for a long time and a community staple! I will be back sooner as opposed to later and will bypass Wingstop because I really like this one much better!"}
{"text":"I love this place and am so glad it's close to my house. The owner is really friendly and the food is delicious. My favorite are the fingers with garlic parmesan or the wings with peanut butter and jelly...super good."}
{"text":"BEST WINGS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Try it! Seriously! I drove past this place for a couple months and never thought anything about it, but when me and my husband finally tried it... we were taken back at how AMAZING these wings are. Some of the nicest people you'll meet working, very clean, just an overall great place! We go at least once a week and I don't see that changing anytime soon!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! But, the only thing better than the food, is the customer service. Cody and AJ are absolutely incredible!! They made the experience here the best experience ever!"}
{"text":"Don't know why this place has A5 star rating it's more like a one-star rating great service but the quality of the food is just not there especially for what they're priced at I would even say it's below average as far as the chicken wing joint goes for it greasy food poor selection in sides you're definitely better off pay a little more for Buffalo Wild Wings or Wingstop definitely better quality there"}
{"text":"I want to update this review, because the owner immediately responded to my post in an effort to correct the circumstances of my visit. His efforts convinced me that he cares and my experience was an isolated one."}
{"text":"Wow this place is a great value! Their chicken strips are huge with great meat quality. The thing that sets this place about from other chicken strip restaurants- their SAUCES! Unbelievably flavorful. Oh and the fries were an unexpected surprise - some of the best fries anywhere. We live far from centennial, but will be sure to drop by here again whenever we're in the area. Oh and the dine-in service was awesome!"}
{"text":"The wings here were good. Excellent service and I'll be going back for sure. Try the garlic Parmesan!! They are the bizness!!!"}
{"text":"When I read the great reviews and saw this was close to home I was excited to try it! I ended up very disappointed. We ordered the 30 piece meal with lemon pepper, Louis n Anna and plain with berry hot on the side. I tried all 3 and they all just tasted like plain unsalted chicken. I even wondered if maybe they messed up and gave me 30 plain wings but they did look slightly different. The dips and bread were good so I gave them a star for that. Kinda mad I wasted my money!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff! Great sauce selection and wings cooked to perfection (extra crispy). Berry hot was the favorite!"}
{"text":"These wings have meat!!! Lemme tell ya, most wing shops serve pigeon legs, this place sells actually meaty chicken wings. I love soggy wet wings and I wasn't disappointed. However, the tropical habanero wasn't as hot as I was expecting, I look forward to trying even spicier wings!"}
{"text":"The wings here are delicious! I suggest call your order in, sometimes the wait time gets pretty long!"}
{"text":"Very friendly, they don't have a good system down yet LLLOOOONGGG wait time. So order online and come a little late if it's the weekend. Food is not bad meaty chicken wings good selection of flavors but the fingers are heavily breaded. Some people like that but I like more chicken then bread myself."}
{"text":"The best wings that I have had in years! The owner is fantastic and the staff so courteous and helpful! Whenever I am in town this will be my new spot. I had three different flavors, the wings were cooked perfectly and the sauces delicious. Brought them to my family for dinner and they love it. Next time I'm going to try some of their other non traditional exciting flavors. This is the spot!!"}
{"text":"Wing kings of Vegas?  Best place I've been to by far!

Buffalo wings are my favorite food in the world.   My favorite thing to do on a day off is to go to my favorite wing place, watch some fights, and eat wings until I'm stuffed. This made living in Vegas very tough, seeing as I couldn't find one wing place that was up to par.  Ever since I moved here in 2014, I've tried every place I've come across; and the best I found was Buffalo Wild Wings.  Sad. 

I came home from a trip back east today, after a weekend long wing binge at my #1 wing spot in America, and before I could feel the withdrawals set in; I happened to drive past wing time.  The great yelp reviews and the detailed menu explanations of every wing flavor on the yelp menu (nowhere else does this) lured me in right away.   

But anyway, let's cut right to the chase.  The girl working the counter was very friendly and helpful, and I could tell she was a wing enthusiast herself as she was passionate about the menu and gave me some tips on what to order.  I went with a few of the $11.99 combos (2 giant fingers, 6 wings, fries, Texas toast, and a drink).   This combo was quite filling and I couldn't finish two.  Another thing I liked about this combo was that it allowed me to try three different flavors; which I was really excited about.  

The first thing I noticed was that I liked the wings much more than the tenders.  The tenders were a bit hard and not nearly as saucy as I would have liked. I'm not sure if this was a one time thing or if it's the norm, but it's not much of a problem, it's just hard for me to say if I got a fair shake on actually trying the flavors I got in finger form.  An extra side of hot garlic fixed everything though, so I'm not complaining.   

The wing quality was very good.  Meaty enough, crispy enough, cooked all the way through.  Very nice.  So let's talk about the flavors.  

Hot garlic - more sweet than hot.  Just a very slight kick to it if any.  My 6 year old daughter said it was too spicy, my girlfriend who isn't a fan of anything too spicy said it was just right.  Me, I love heat, but I'm a sucker for a sweet sauce.  I'd say it's maybe 70/30 sweet to heat.  I'd also say it's one of the best wing flavors I've had anywhere.  The hot garlic alone instantly made this my #1 wing place in Vegas.  Love at first bite. 

Tropical habanero - another very good sauce.  I loved the sweet, tropical taste here and it was a great combination with the hint of habanero. Also, another flavor that's way more sweet than heat.  I'm gonna have to say that the flavor was 80% pineapple 20% habanero, and the habanero was just for flavoring, not for kick.  My 6 year old daughter loved it and ended up getting a side of those sauce to dip her toast in.  She detected no spice.  Still a great wing flavor, and one I'll be coming back for.

Lemon pepper - my daughter's favorite flavor. We've ordered lemon pepper wings all over the country, and I'm gonna have to say that Wing Time's are easily top 2 if not #1.  We were all very very happy with their version of the lemon pepper.  

The next flavors I ordered as fingers, not wings.  Again, I didn't get the same amount of sauce/chicken ratio this time around so it's a bit harder to rate these sauces but I'll give it a try.  

Hot - good flavor hot sauce.  Could have been hotter but I liked the taste. Next time I'll be giving them a try as a wing instead of finger. 

Garlic Parmesan - hints of really good flavor, but really subtle. They just didn't put enough flavoring for me to give a fair judgment on it.  It says it was a sauce, but to me it looked like a dry rub.  I was really confused about that but I was too focused on enjoying my meal to ask which it was. 

Louis and Ana - the garlic/butter flavor was really really good in some bites, but in other bites it was greatly overpowered by the Cajun flavoring.  Not so crazy about the Cajun flavor so these were my least favorite.  Still far from bad. 

All in all, I was very very happy with this place.  I purposely ordered enough to take home leftovers, so I'm happy to say that these fingers (with a side of hot magic, I mean garlic) will be my second dinner.  After that, I might even go back tomorrow.  Hats off to wing time and a special thanks to the helpful girl working the counter.  This is my new favorite place in Vegas, and you can count on me being a regular.   You stay classy, Wing Time.  Thanks for being y"}
{"text":"Already back! This time I went with the Ensenada Chilada. It was pretty tasty! The sauce the wings are tossed in use an enchilada sauce with some taco seasoning. Then they throw it in the oven to melt a Mexican blend of seasonings. It wasn't spicy at all if you're worried. My favorite is still the Louis N Anna though. 
My son had the chicken fingers (plain) and the Mac n cheese. Wow! Those may have been the best fingers I've had! The GM (I assume?) said there are ruffles potato chips in the breading as well as some secrets that he didn't divulge. Very good! Chicken was very tender. Annnnd the Mac n Cheese. It was incredible! I don't know where but there is definitely bacon involved in it somewhere. Has a subtle smoky bacon flavor that goes great with the Mac n cheese. 
The Ranch and the blue cheese were both very good. Pretty certain that they are made in house. They have other renditions that I'll try next time (siracha honey and hickory ranch look tempting). 
Great service yet again! Drinks were kept full and trays promptly cleared. Zero complaints! Well....no beer, but I can wait!"}
{"text":"Go here now!!! 
This place is seriously a magical find! 
First time going here, we ordered a party pack for 3 people. At a very reasonable price, That came with 30 boneless wings, veggies, a huge box of fries, 3 pieces of buttery Texas toast and we added a large Mac and cheese. With the party pack we could also change the flavors per 10 and even though we only got 2(honey bbq&teriyaki) I have to say they were a fantastic ratio of sauce to meat. The boneless wings are so large no one (3 of 3) could finish their full 10 pieces and that is saying something! We even ended up having leftovers which in this house is unheard of on our movie nights!  Their fries are also very delicious even if I couldn't finish mine, their carrot and celery sticks where very fresh and my husband absolutely loved their Mac &cheese and toast.
All and all, I think we are just waiting for the next movie night to show up so we can order from here again!"}
{"text":"Finally a great wing place this side of town. We called to place an order for pick up. The lady at the cashier was extremely friendly and even gave us a courtesy call that our food was ready for pick up. It was very nice of her. We were amazed how everything was decently priced with so many flavors and dipping sauces to choose from... plus you get fries, texas toast, and a drink. My boyfriend and I found everything to be amazing. We ordered the wings and chicken finger combo. Honestly.. you can't go wrong with the flavors and dipping sauces here. Although fav flavors were the cajun and lemon pepper and my fav dipping sauces were the chipotle honey and honey mustard sauce. We will definitely be coming back for sure. Great food and excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Went in and placed an order this is about 8pm you figure it's been open all day and there had to be some type of business since it was open my order came out to almost 60$ gave them a 100$ bill he then took it to the back and then came back and said they didn't have change ?? I would of been due back around 40$ if you add the math and I'm almost positive the place did more then 40$ in business since his reply was we been very busy all day that's why they didn't have change ??? Really you kidding me, I've met the owner when he owned  \" create burgers \" I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate the very relaxed style of work and loss of business over laziness. Also while ordering asked for a large order of mac & cheese he said maybe we're out let me check then came back like uhhh we can find one if you order them ??? Oh and when I walked in cell phones in everyone's hands that was even worse then the crappy service, will I be back ? Probably not too many places to take your money & keep things consistent. TERRIBLE !!!"}
{"text":"Whew! I am SO pleased to update this review and add back the 5th star!

Came in on a Saturday night to get our wing fix, per request of our little man. Got the usual combo, sauces on the side, both types of fries. Nothing to be disappointed about. WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE FRIES?! How are they legitimately so perfect? Every. Single. Time. I still haven't had a better sweet potato fry, or chicken wing. 

Man... Those wings though. Another level. Always made fresh to order and come out piping hot. Service was fast and friendly. We come in so often that the staff knows who we are and they are always willing to accommodate our naked wings with sauce on the side request, which I believe I mentioned before, but truly feel that it's worth mentioning again. We sincerely appreciate it.

WingTime, you are STILL the king of all wings in my book. See you next time!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. We slipped in right before they closed and they welcomed us in. Wonderful service and the food was top notch!  We look forward to going again!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I stopped here! I have been craving weeks for a while but did not want to get overpriced, probably not tasting very good wings on the strip, where I was staying. So my boyfriend and I made the trip here. SO WORTH IT!!!!! The staff was so helpful and attentive. They accidentally gave my boyfriend an 8 piece combo when he ordered a 10 piece and they handled it so professionally, didn't even question it! The wings, though, were sooooo good! The only disappointment I have is they don't have this place in California, where I'm from, so I can get these amazing wings whenever I want!"}
{"text":"I think this might be our new favorite wing place! The food is great and the service is top notch as well. As we entered we were greeted by the owner which was super friendly and very accommodating. The prices are much better than their competitors and the amount of food they give is pretty decent. The wings are big and the toast is excellent! I also recommend trying the southwestern ranch!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Soooo delicious! First time coming and glad I stopped in because my kids gobbled everything up. I got the sliders with Louis N Ana rub and dipped in the homemade Blue Cheese....and the Texas toast...yummy!"}
{"text":"Been to different spots for wings in vegas and this place has the best ones i had so far! Great customer service"}
{"text":"The best wings I've ever had... been in vegas for 7 months and tried a few places that were not great and extremely pricey. The wings were perfect and so full of flavor. They had some wings i never heard of that were extremely tasty such as peanut butter and jelly. The customer service was amazing as well. My family and I will definitely be back i wish i could give this place 10 stars because we were so impressed keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"First time ordering from Wing Time. Had food delivered during Knights game. Wings and fries arrived HOT!!! Buffalo and Louis n Ana sauce; both very good. Wings were good size too. Yummy."}
{"text":"Didn't like it one bit.... from all the reviews I read I was expecting way better. I had the traditional wings hot and lemon pepper. The sauces super salty and not even spicy for the hot one. Fries hard and dry, chicken fingers great size but once again sauces very salty. Not coming back :/"}
{"text":"First time ordering from Wing Time. We were very impressed with the food. Ordered the 50 piece party pack, everything was great and the gentleman that took my order over the phone was very accommodating and made sure to note any requests that I had, no matter how small to guarantee everything was just right. THANK YOU Wing Time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have to try the peanut butter and jelly wings it was delicious. Service is amazing they treat everyone right."}
{"text":"Dined/ordered 3X within 2 weeks lol! Owner/manager super awesome. Staff helpful during dine in. Flavor choices and taste of wings/fingers was perfect! Wings were crisp as requested. Combo choices very worth the portion and price! My fave flavors..the Louis n Ana and Garlic Parmesan! Mac and cheese was okay. I love wings and soo glad its 5 mins away. Online ordering super convenient. Must try if you looooovve dem wangs!!"}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers and toast but your goal here is wings and they weren't that great. Soggy wings are never good which I couldn't even finish them. Also, I ordered lemon pepper which didn't even barely have lemon pepper spices on it. 

All in all its a good generic place with like 8 flavors of wings. Didn't give me a wow factor at all. Nice people who work there though."}
{"text":"Called in order for Super Bowl party at 11:00AM was told it would be ready for pickup at 2:00.  Arrived at 2 for my order and waited over 30 minutes

Never going back"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place based on the reviews. I ordered the 6 wing combo extra crispy! When I got home and started to eat the wings they were no where near extra crispy, barely even done! I had to pick and eat the pieces that I actually thought were done because I didn't want to waste my money completely! What a disappointment! If I wanted semi done wings I would have asked for that!"}
{"text":"Nice surprise to walk into this wingery. Never frozen, fresh and cooked to order Chicken Wings were plump and juicy. Doesn't get much better than this and I know my wings!! Lots of choices to mix and match from, all they need is tequila and beer! Owner was very passionate and friendly, the young ladies working the register were cute and pleasant too. I ended up ordered $35 worth of chicken and looking back I should have gotten the combo cause it's a better deal. Next time I'll be back to try to PB&J wings!!!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but I felt almost compelled to let the world know, that this is the best wing spot ever. Their macaroni and cheese may get me disowned by my grandmother for being the best I've ever had. Their wing flavors are all amazing in their own way. And I can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"All last week, I was sampling different wing places for the best wings. And, I chose wing time! I came in last week and got a little combo just for myself. The combo was just what I wanted, six pieces of wings, with two different flavors. Some blue cheese, french fries, Texas toast. Not to mention, a drink! You get a lot. I did get a little side order of carrots, but it wasn't expensive at all.

Today, we were feeding the wonderful volunteers that are remodeling our church. They are so kind & generous for devoting their free time to our church. So, I placed an order for the 30 wings special. I ordered it ahead of time and it was ready when I got there. Everything was there. And, I really like the way that they separated the cold items and put them in a separate bag.

Everybody loved the wings including myself. I will definitely continue coming here either for the lunch special just for myself or if in the future, there will be another party, I will definitely get their large wings special deal again! I really love their wings! They are perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Plus, they have the best customer service!"}
{"text":"One of the best wing restaurants in town.   Meaty chicken cooked well.  Lots of flavors and dipping sauces.  Gr8 cole slaw, thick sliced fresh veggies and texas toast done right.  Prices and service are superior.   Gr8 for leftovers so order extra.   Has everything but Hooter girls."}
{"text":"First time coming here and this place is the BEST wing spot ever! I'm telling everyone I know about this place!! Julio served us and he had the BEST customer service! So go check out Julio!!"}
{"text":"Man... my wife and I eat here all the time.. frequent customers! I am the type of person who likes to order online, so I can go pick it up quickly. Every.. single... time I have gone to this place it's just extremely annoying how long I have had to wait. If I am ordering at 2 and the order says pickup will be ready at 230. Why on earth would I not be getting my food until 3. Nobody says anything, no sorry sir just a few more minutes. Or even a sorry about the wait. People come in after me and order they get there food before me. Now I am not the person who sits on yelp and complains about every little thing, but this is the last time I will probably go back to this place. Just really fed up with the terrible service. Food is fantastic, which as obviously kept us coming back, but man it's not worth my time to sit there without even some acknowledgment. Don't recommend ordering online ever from this place. Even sometimes sitting in takes forever. It's chicken guys... figure it out.."}
{"text":"This was my boyfriend & I first time trying WingTime , the cashier Felix was so patient & very polite ! It honestly blew us away ! That kind of customer service just doesn't exist anymore ! Super genuine !!!! Nice to have that kind of experience in customer service ! The food was very good !! We will be returning ! Felix needs a bonus lol"}
{"text":"Very tasty wings! Wide assortment of flavors; from garlic parmesan to peanut butter and jelly  (go figure). Super friendly staff. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Compares favorably to WingStop, prices are a little cheaper IMO & the chicken pieces are bigger! The Garlic Parmesan is excellent. Apparently they now do boneless which I didn't know till after I ordered chicken strips instead of wings - so if that's your jam go for it"}
{"text":"Incredible wings!! I love wings so much and I eat them a couple times a week. We decided to try this one out and was so glad! I love the Louisiana ones. I forget the actual name right now but they are freakin incredible. The fries are on point too. The garlic toast is just shut the front door good! Love this spot and is a new favorite in the rotation!"}
{"text":"Best fried wings I have had on the west coast since moving here. The chicken tenders looked fabulous as well."}
{"text":"Outstanding wings!  We have tried I think every place in the valley, and the Draft House was the best....until finding this place.  Big, juicy wings and hand breaded, white meat chicken fingers.  Great flavor and some unique options to try too.  Lance (owner) is personable and really seems to care about customer opinions and wants honest feedback"}
{"text":"Great service first off... owner Lance came out talked to us and was super friendly. It makes a difference when someone takes pride in what they do and takes the time to become familiar with their customer base. Next the food is great! Best chicken wings I've had in a long time... their selection of flavors satisfy any and all taste buds and their dipping sauces are flavor combinations that I've never seen before. I'm not a honey person but my boyfriend ordered the Saraicha honey and chipotle honey last time and got me hooked, they are amazing! I ordered it again tonight and couldn't get enough, I dipped my fries, Texas toast, and wings in it. We've ordered quite a few times now and decided this is our wing place of choice now. We live practically across the street so location fits our needs too. Keep doing what your doing Wing Time! You've got customers for life here. Best new addition to the NW!"}
{"text":"Hopefully this place WON'T  get closed down because it is  too damn good!!!! Fast service as well.."}
{"text":"We went to this place on a whim (we were actually headed to the Mexican place next door )
Best decision ever!!!   The wings are great, meaty and flavorful.  Different types of rubs and sauces, big sides as well. We have gone back twice since. The owner is awesome, takes care of orders personally and caters to his customers. Now they're even open for lunch, yay!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food & service!! I'm so glad there is finally a place that has great tasting & perfect size wings with fantastic add on options. Without a doubt I would highly recommend giving this place a try & you will never won't to go somewhere else. Every time I ate at that Buffalo Wild Wing place I did not feel good after, but at this place I felt just fine.

You can eat in or take out(recommend calling ahead about 15 minutes since the wings are cooked fresh every time)

I can't wait to go back again soon."}
{"text":"I honestly must say they have the best chicken bread and sides I love this place to me it's better than most wing places I been to especially when purchase large amounts of food and they cook it on time and everything fresh the best wing spot in vegas hands down"}
{"text":"First of all, I was probably one of the first customers to eat here when it first opened a couple months back and I continued going back at least once every week on average! So much that the owner Lance treats my like family now every time I walk in. Well he treats everyone great and the customer service he and his team give should be what every restaurant should aspire to be.
From the minute you walk in the door your greeted like family and with a smile. The two ladies at the counter are awesome and very helpful when taking your order. Lance is there most of the time and is always interacting with the customers, which is not something you see a lot these days, especially from a wing place.
I've been living in the area for over 7 years now and I always felt that we never really had a good place for wings and fingers. BWW is average at best with a good atmosphere and let's not even talk about Wing Nutz across the street from this place, their food is below average and same goes for their customer service. Finally Wingtime opened and they are here to stay and fulfill the void of best chicken wing restaurant!
But you can't be good without the food being good and with that I say 4 words: Peanut Butter Jelly Time! There my favorite finger flavor but every single other flavor I've tried have been great also! Cajun is so good, there Buffalo Hot is awesome, and my Fiancée's favorite, Tropical Habanero. Louis N Ana is the bomb too! Everything from the toast to their homemade ranch dipping sauce is the best!
Overall, this place is awesome and I wish much success to this place and keep being kool Lance.

P.S. Now let me get back to my 3 piece PBJT that I haven't had in over 3 weeks since I was in Utah! Lol."}
{"text":"What can I say!  I was in the mood for some chicken come on down and try their delicious selections!  I am normally not inclined to try new things when I am starving but at this visit I did!  The cashier recommended a few items to try but the one that caught my eye was the peanut butter and jelly? Um who would of thought that would be a good combo to put on chicken wings! Apparently wing time did and I am so happy I ordered it! Can I just say wow! It definitely worked in the flavor department, and the best thing is I didn't have to get dessert, this knocked out my sweet tooth craving, I asked for some on my celery sticks and it was definitely good, sometimes you just forget how good things are!  
Another thing that caught my eye was the sliders- they had one with flaming hot Cheetos and I had to order it! I am a sucker for food with flaming hot Cheetos infused or incorporated, I definitely wasn't disappointed with it, it had that punch and kick I was looking for!
Would I come back to this location? Yes!  I absolutely loved the infused PBJ used on my wings, and I was definitely digging the sliders!  Is it worth multiple visits? Sure why not? If you try something you like, why not come back again? How's the service? Great!  The cashiers will definitely give you the low down of their menu and offer some recommendations!  Is this place good for kids?  I believe so, the manager at the restaurant said they will be adding Mac and cheese to the menu- that's a kids must have!  I know my son is alway ordering it at every restaurant!"}
{"text":"WOW! I'm a big fan of chicken fingers in general. This place is the BEST, and I mean the best I have ever tried. Keep in mind there is a bit of wait due to the chicken being fresh. Staff was great!! The owner came out to greet us and told us the story behind this place. Good service, amazing food & good on prices!"}
{"text":"Great place go weekly and people
Are great owners is awesome 
Would never eat at any other wing place 
Wing time is the place to go"}
