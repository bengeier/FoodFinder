{"text":"As a San Diego Chargers fan, this is the best bar ! The people here are so funny and great, I love just coming after work and  relaxing with a cold bud, and sometimes when the game is on. Well that's even better!"}
{"text":"Found a local bar that has some good drinks, pool tables and nice machines.  Didn't get a chance to try the food. The bartender was friendly and made our night.  Thanks Donald! Can't wait to come back with other friends.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Cool dive. Stopped in Thusday for a drink late-night stayed till dawn. Jukebox rocks. Didn't play but saw 4 pool tables big screen TVs. Thanks to the bar tender Steve, we had a great time. Will go back. Soon."}
{"text":"I just ordered the 18 inch meat pizza and it was the best pizza I have had in a very long time..very fresh!!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this spot all the time. They fired some of the previous staff members and for the most part, nothing has changed. I'm sitting here...played a hundy, bartender walked past me a few times (no eye contact, even though I swear I asked for service...maybe my voice doesn't work right today?) and there's only like 6 people here...I had to yell to get attention and I'm gaming like a hungry person...I never had to ask, I'd have to cut them off...they'd come and take my drinks and bring back a fresh drink without hesitation. Ally...apparently, has an at home issue that she needs people in the bar to recognize. I don't go out to bars to hear the problems of a bartender...I go to game, drink and forget about my shit for a while...can't do that here anymore. For this...I'm out! Sorry guys. I will still come here, just not when this mopey personality is here..."}
{"text":"It was a great place but with the new owner it's the last time I go there, he's an ignorant person. Brown pride be aware you don't want to watch your charger games there at all!"}
{"text":"This place has outstanding wings & fries!! They have over 70 flavors to choose from and offer free samples of the flavors! Great  customer service too! I would recommend this place to everyone who loves great wings & fries!! :)"}
{"text":"Was looking for wings and this place came up so We made the trip from the strip to this place. I walked in and it was not very full. Personally I loved this aspect of it. It is a San Diego or Los Angeles Charger bar. Staff was friendly and talked shit, made me feel at home. The wings were freaken amazinggggggg. I didn't want to leave but I am not a charger fan and they were going to play next. All the Tv's go to the Chargers. Fantasy Football is my choice of football so I went back to the strip! Next time im in town I will go back and demolish those pigs wings. My Fiancee and I murdered 4 pounds of wings. Left an impression there!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is unbelievable. Food is great! Awesome specials. Welcoming cowboys family! Wish we had a bar like this in Houston. Love this place!"}
{"text":"OPEN 24/7 They have changed Shooters from a Charger bar to a DALLAS COWBOYS bar but any team is welcome.  They have a nice large bar with gaming(smoking), a section for people to watch the game (non smoking), a large pool area with six pool tables.  Bar is very CLEAN and bartenders are amazing!  I may be biased but DONALD is the best!  Worth coming in and checking this bar out.  Stop by grave shift from midnight to eight am!  Bar is 24/7   #gravelife"}
{"text":"The food was horrible!!! The food in the pictures definitely changed Chicken fingers?... no a chicken breast breaded in cornflakes and cut into odd little strips after cooking with no flavor and soggy coating.  Sloppy joe tots....in theory a good idea but executed with way too much sloppy sauce (salty) and not enough meat to be called sloppy joe.  The chicken fingers in the photos are definitely different than what u get.  Never again."}
{"text":"this is my the best spot to be during football season especially if you are a SAN DIEGO CHARGERS fan :-) hecky yea.  Way, way off the strip but theest places usually are.  They welcome all kinds here, yes Faider..oops i mean Raiders fans i'm talking about you. If you looking to watch a SAN DIEGO game, have some fun w/ friends, throw back a couple of beers and crack jokes all on good fun then this is the place for you (San Diego Chargers Fan)   GO CHARGERS!!!"}
{"text":"Love it!!!! So many flavors ! Great wings, must try the pig wigs!!!! Awesome service :)"}
{"text":"First off, i cant be more ecstatic that they are now a #cowboynation bar. The new paint job and swag are awesome.  I plan on spending my sundays there with my dallas friends. The GM and bartender alyson is awesome ,i followed her from her previous bar. So when i come in she knows what i drink and i normally dont have to ask. She fun,bubbly and creates a good atmosphere.  The gaming promotions are 2nd to none ,easy sign up process. Also ive met crystal another bartender and had a blast with her on st patricks day, my friends and i enjoyed the night. While they were very busy alyson and crystal never let us go dry on drinks. And the wing king inside omg the pig wings are amazing"}
{"text":"The location is wonderful, the outdoor seating area on the Intercostal Waterway is beautiful. The food was \"good\"... nothing to write home mom about but was cooked well & tasty. My only issue was with the hostess \"Rude Ruth\" she was kind of short & dry... not the best first impression when arriving to a restaurant."}
{"text":"Really can't tell you if this place is good or not? The sign outside says \"Darts\" but all they have are pool tables and laughed at me when I asked. That was enough for me to turn and walk out."}
{"text":"Great Spot. You can play pool, Beer Pong, Darts, they also Have a DJ on the weekends. They also have many different event and specials monthly and a happy hour from 4PM-7PM...."}
{"text":"Fun local bar with great happy hour. And an  even better bartender ,the crowd was easy-going and the atmosphere was relaxed.."}
{"text":"Great place and awesome bartenders. It's hidden gem in Vegas. Relax atmosphere with lots of tvs"}
{"text":"Oh my word!!  This kitchen knows wings, both chicken and pig.  ...and the pizza!!!  Best in the valley, if not the state.  'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 9 years . After  tonight never ever again would i go back. bartender was so rude. Instead i came to pts. With my friends .theres was a party of 8. They lost a good customer. Im very upset at the owner for hiring a non professional bartender..it"}
{"text":"My wife and I are looking forward to going back, good music and pool the food wasnt the best but we had a good time"}
