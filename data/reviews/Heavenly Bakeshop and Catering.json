{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place because we love Filipino food (his mother is Filipina) and I saw the reviews on Yelp which led me to think I needed to check this place out for myself, as there are many mixed reviews.  When you walk in, you are hit with a wonderful food smell. They were cooking Lechon in the back, and even brought out a couple trays while we were looking around. Many of the reviews stated that the lechon is $8.50 but today it is now $11.95 for a pound (with no sides or rice)! I know pork prices are going up, but this seemed pretty pricey. I urged my husband to \"treat yoself\" and get it, as it looked from the trays to be fresh and delicious. For myself, I ordered the pansit as this is one of my favorites. They have a very limited menu from the kitchen if you are ordering fresh. There is, however, 3 fridges stocked with containers of Filipino favorites, all for $6.95 apiece (also way higher than the Filipino food I've had in the past at other establishments).  We also ordered the halo-halo and asked that it not be made until we were done eating. The woman seemed to misunderstand so we had to explain it to her several times.  Well, the pansit came out right away, like in 5 minutes. It has a savory flavor (if I would guess, I would say they use beef or pork stock to cook the noodles as it had a meaty flavor, and not greasy at all, which is a problem I've had with many restaurants that make this dish. The add-ins are limited: cabbage, onions, carrots and a few pieces of pork. I was a little disappointed that they did not put shredded chicken, sausage and shrimp in there, as that is my favorite way of having it, and the way my mother-in law makes it. Overall, I would say I would order the pansit again. You get a full to-go container of food for $6.95. I tasted the lechon and it was tender and flavorful. They give you a little container of sauce to go with it, but IMO it was not needed. The skin was crunchy and it was enough for two people to share. I walked up to the counter to ask for 2 cups of water and the woman saw me from the back, and ignored me. She finally came up front to answer the phone, which I stood and watched her talk on the phone, taking an order. Finally she then took the halo-halo cup we ordered and took it to the back, thinking we were ready for it to be prepared. I watched as a man in the back started making it, when all i wanted was some water. After all that, she said they didn't have water! I saw cups on the shelf behind her so I knew she was just scamming to get us to buy drinks, which we had to do because we were thirsty after eating. We ended up buying two water bottles, puto and some pan de sol that was still warm. We still had not received the lechon after about 10-15 minutes so we also asked when that would be brought out. The woman looked confused and asked if we ordered the lechon. We were like, YESSSS,,about 15 minutes ago! She kept asking if we ordered it and paid for it, when she had the ticket from the order we made, and it was only 15 minutes ago we ordered only TWO items from the kitchen! She finally brought it out 5 more minutes later. Not happy about that. I knew it was coming, but she brought out the halo-halo as we were still eating and so we had to start eating it before it melted. We wound up just taking the rest of our food home, as we had our desert before we were done.  Overall, I think the food we ordered was pretty good. The customer service leaves a little to be desired. No one was rude to us, as some previous posters have said, but it seems like the owners have trouble understanding requests and orders from English speakers (not sure if this is a problem for Tagalog speakers as well).  I think we will come back to try the heat and serve portions in the fridge (the ingredients are listed on the label, which I found to be a HUGE plus, because sometimes I have no idea what is in Filipino dishes), and order more halo-halo. The halo-halo was unsweetened, as one poster mentioned. However, not only did it have the beans and jellies that are normally in the dessert, but also plantains, vanilla and ube ice cream AND flan. Not a lot of places I've been to in Phoenix put all of those in their halo-halo. I liked it even though it was not sweetened. Made me want to walk over to Lee Lee's and buy some ube ice cream. I love that stuff! So, give this place a try for yourself. Don't let others' reviews dissuade you from trying something new. I am glad I tried it and love to support small businesses over corporations. Next time I will know what to expect, and probably bring our own drinks lol!"}
{"text":"Be careful if you ever want to order \"LECHON\" at this place.  We ordered what they claimed was a 33lb lechon with the price of close to $300. Surprise surprise because when we started chopping the pig, the WHOLE BOTTOM stomach part of the lechon was completely gone. The part where you are supposed to stuff the pig? Yes it was not included.  When we called to complain, they have the nerve to give me the attitude saying \" that's how it's always been\" like it was my first time to see a lechon?    This HEAVENLY BAKE SHOP IS A CHEAT !!!   I will not order from this place again!  Check out the photo , the whole bottom of this pig is not included."}
{"text":"First I would like to say I visited on one of the hottest days ever and visiting from California you know Arizona is always hot but first time feeling the high of 121 degrees (whoa!). For every bakery the climate always is a battle.  So I definitely would look towards the other items they have as a nice treat if you are ever skeptical on the baked items. Their Ube Guinitaan is a warm desert that my daughter loves.  Another is their cooked foods that had been prepped, packaged, cooled for warming at home. My faves are the Dinuguan, Menudo and Sisig.  I have grown up in a Filipino family catering business and everyones family has their individual spin on dishes they grew up with making it difficult to please everyone's subjective tastes.    I look at as we do with other foods, for example Chinese & Japanese Food some people add soy sauce for their taste, Italian food some add cheese, pepper or garlic, for Mexican some add Tapatio, etc. I do the same for Filipino food but I know the traditional people out there want it to be exact to their memory. This place makes it pretty close so I make my little taste adjustments too, \"Mom & Pop\" restaurant definitely. Love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and worth the money. They provide great portions and the food is fresh, especially the lumpia, lechon, and caldereta. This place beats Jeepney Bistro and it's worth the drive from Tucson. I will keep coming here to get my food after a long day of shopping at Lee Lee's."}
{"text":"So excited to eat here today but decided to take out food instead. The lechon looks so good and crispy but when I got home, only the top part is great but everything else beneath the one-pound order is burnt. Dang it! Don't sell the burnt lechon/meat coz you're gonna lose customers and worse, first timers will not recommend you to others...get it?  And the pork bbq? Oh i thought I was served adobo in a stick. Soooo sour! But the cheese bread is good at least."}
{"text":"I come to Heavenly Bakeshop because of their food. Their tulingan is similar to our sinaing na isda in Batangas. They have variety of choices too, from entree to desserts. I will always come back for more Filipino food."}
{"text":"Very good Pandesal bread.  I travel here just for it.  I recently bought siaopao style chicken buns and find that everyone has their definition as to what it tastes like.  I would say it tastes good enough to quench a hungry stomach.  I am only learning now that you could order food to be catered and to eat in.  I think next time I'll try it."}
{"text":"A small Filipino bake shop.  Don't expect the confectionary or pastry that you would find at a Japanese bakery, as their main focus seems to be on savory meat buns, plus a cheese-filled ones and some flan in the pastry case.  I picked up a baked chicken bun from the front counter (not the fridge).  The bread was pretty good though quite dense and without a lot of flavor.  It did have some sweetness that I enjoyed (second ingredient was sugar).  The finely shredded chicken inside was very moist and had a nice balance of sweet/salty/savory from the garlic, oyster sauce, and pepper.  While it wasn't as fluffy as other buns, the flavor of the meat definitely was a step above others, and the gentleman working the counter was cordial."}
{"text":"Small, local owned/operated Filipino bake shop.  I only tried the 5 pack of Ube (Taro) stuffed cookies/pastries and found them DELICIOUS.. the have sesame seed sprinkled on them.  I wish I knew what most of it meant, but I tried my luck with the sweet ube pastry and really, really liked it!  I will be back and try more!  Thanks to all those (Jason B) that recommended pastries.. I definitely will try more out next time."}
{"text":"fresh pandesal and lechon!!!!  one pound is more more than enough for 3 people. they also have crispy pata and chicharin bulaklak. both i'll try when i go back next week. so glad there's a place here in Chandler that could satisfy my craving for lechon at a very affordable price. $8.95 for a pound.   I also got the fresh pandesal. it was light and fluffy but a bit too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"Hopefully, third time's the charm. Heavenly is now the third Filipino bakery to open in this same spot in the Lee Lee's shopping center.   First impression, clean, lots of product on shelves to choose from, friendly customer service.     I was only able to quickly eye their goodies, before my little one started trying to rearrange their product display, dropping a package of \"Palitaw\" on the floor. It didn't pop open, but I bought it anyway, since the fall made it's contents all jumbled up. Good thing I have fond memories of this treat from New Years in my Mamalo's house back home. I also ordered one of their Cheese pastries. Curious if it tasted like or better than the previous owners flaky cheese pastry.   I paid with my debit (couldn't do that with the previous bakery) so that's a plus. While paying, I noticed off the back left of the store behind the register, was a refrigerator stacked with ready made take home dishes, like menudo, If i recall correctly. So, next time I'll definitely take one home, but, I didn't this time, because I still had to do my grocery shopping at LeeLee's.   Once home, I tried the Palitaw. It was soft and pleasantly chewy with a non-sweet powdery coating. I think I recall coconut flakes on the ones my dad made for me back home. I'm not sure what the powdery coating is, it's got a subtle flavor of perhaps toasted crushed rice.  But, It might not be something everyone would like. If I were to compare it to something, it reminds me of mochi.  which i love.   I put these in the fridge and they didn't get hard.    I didn't treat the cheese pastry with care as I shopped around that day. When I got home to open the bag, it's top layer was almost all flaked off. So, I'll be ordering this again & eating straight from the case next time. Overall it was light and flaky and not greasy. The cheese filling was also nice, not too sweet.   My toddler loved this treat and that it wasn't overly sweet was good for her too.  I'd love it if they make another variation with some kind of fruit to contrast the cheese.    I'd like to go back without my little one, so that I can fully experience all that this 1 month new bakery has to offer & take better photos.  I'm giving them a middle of the board solid rating of 3 stars, A-OK.  I am expecting that on my next visit, Heavenly will be getting more stars."}
{"text":"This place has everything!!  I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon for the first time and was so surprised at how different it was from previous owners in this location.  All items are baked fresh on the premises and every rack and shelf was full of goodies to choose from. My haul included hopia with mongo beans, espasol, palitaw, ginataan, puto bumbong, an ube loaf, turon, vegetable lumpia, a container of tokwat baboy, and I couldn't pass up a lb.of lechon for $8.50  I will be back very soon, besides the ready to eat food, they also had for purchase, bags of lumpia that you could take and cook at home.  I'm so thrilled they owners decided to come out of retirement and open this wonderful bakeshop."}
{"text":"Virtually always have a pleasant experience here. Service is warm and friendly. Love some of their pastry selections. Lechon on Sundays! *woo hoo*  Will definitely return. Again! ^_^"}
{"text":"This bakeshop is located in the same plaza as Lee Lee Supermarket right next to a vietnamese restuarant. As my husband and I were making a stop to Lee Lee's I noticed this bakeshop.   There use to be a Filipino bakery in the same spot but they shut down over a year ago I believe and just today I notice that there was a new bakeshop. After we stopped at Lee Lees I told my husband that I wanted to check out this place. There were a couple in there purchasing some bakery and I hear her talking to one of the owners and I recognized their dialect, next thing we know they were speaking Tagalog one of Phillipines dialect.   I checked out what they had, and I saw that they had one of my favorite desserts \"Pan De Coco\" which is a dinner roll like filled with sweet coconut so I ended up purchasing a box of 4.   As we were being rung up for our purchase, we had a little chat with the owner and she was really friendly (Her and her husband owns this shop). She told us a story of how their shop came about. They were originally from New Jersey came to Arizona to retire. They owned a few shops in NJ but sold it all before they came to AZ. They realized that they didn't want to just sit around and do nothing, being retired was not their style, so they both decided open a bakery shop in AZ.   Knowing that this is a mom and pop shop I quickly to like it more because I like to support mom n pops as much as I can because their food seems to taste better.   So on that note: for those Filippinos out there and even those who love Filippino food when ever your craving for something sweet go to this family business. Its worth it. Oh and they cater too!!"}
{"text":"The owners of this bakery are originally from New Jersey and originally owned a chain of bakery shops of the same name until they sold them off and retired here. So, in terms of experience they have it, and they know their stuff.  The lechon on weekends is on point. It's crispy and roasted the way I like it, Tagalog style! =) Yes, it does make a difference. =)  Other things I'm a fan of there are their puto bungbong (glutinous rice with shredded coconut and sugar), the espasol (filipino rice cake made from rice flour cooked in coconut milk and sweetened coconut strips, dusted with toasted rice flour) it's true laguna to the pinoys. Their siopao is decent, the ensymada is lacking alot of topping, and the empanadas are okay not that great. Overall they have a wide selection of filipino baked goods at decent prices but you gotta try the lechon, at least a pound of it ($8.50).   You oughta try it and keep this local filipino bakery around coz they're worth it."}
{"text":"This place My ex and I went there 4 years ago and ube is good puto is good. I just find out that you can order lunch here too nice place."}
{"text":"Filipino bakeshop in Chandler, AZ AND it's right by LeeLee's Oriental Market (1 out of 2 Asian  Markets in the area).  I have very mixed feeling about this place because it's the first Filipino place we found when we moved here 3 years ago. The staff is very friendly...like we've known   I have had the hot food specials here which was pretty good.  Lechon is only served Sat and Sun but is worth the wait (treat) during the week.  My mother in law loves the fresh hot pan de sol but again only offered on the weekends.  We have bought the frozen egg rolls and cooked them at home; were very happy with the crispiness and quality if them.  I have had the sweets and bake goods but was not very happy.  They were either old or flavorless.  I wouldn't buy the food in the fridge because I rather have the freshly cooked food specials they have.  Since we came from CA, I'm used to Red Ribbon or Goldilocks quality pastries.  We go here often for only certain things so that is why I gave this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"It such a hole in a wall type of bakery. Although I have not tasted this food. They do have some authentic Filipino foods. My husband tried the ensaymada he said it was okay. I will go back just to try couple things. 2 star for now until I have a chance to try their foods."}
{"text":"Finally!  A good Filipino bakery in AZ!    It's a wonderful place to find local fresh baked Filipino goods here instead of the plastic bagged ones shipped from California laden with anti-molding agents and dough conditioners.   I picked up a bag of Pan de Sal.  If you get there early enough, it will be fresh from the oven.  Siopao, a steamed dumpling filled with your choice of pork adobo or curried chicken is so good even after a couple of days in the fridge reheated.  My little cutie pie loved the loaf of sweet bread filled with coconut jam (macapuno).  The meat empanada was tasteless and dry, even the dough.   They serve the usual lumpia, adobo, palabok and much more for lunch.   I am really impressed with their food and affordable prices. I will definitely be back to get some of the meryenda (glutinous rice snacks)."}
{"text":"Very sweet family with very tasty foods, pastries and everything Filipino. If you miss Filipino foods, this is the place to get them.  The pre-packed meals are great so you can go home with a variety of favorite Filipino dishes.  I grew up and in the Philippines and immigrated here when I was 28.  My aunt was a great cook.  Nothing compares to her cooking.  Not even several restaurants in Los Angeles. Heavenly Bakeshop comes very close to the home cooking I miss."}
{"text":"Well, we've been here twice now.  First time we got pancit.  It was salty.  Not horrible but not great.  Today we mostly bought baked goods.  The pan de sal was mediocre.  The baliwag was mediocre.  The puto bungbong was very disappointing."}
{"text":"We ordered lechon for Christmas and it was by far the worst lechon I have ever tasted. The skin was not crispy and it was way too salty. Our guests hardly touched the lechon. And what is the deal with the box they put the lechon? It had shoe marks all over it!!!! Im thinking it was a box that was on the floor, they walked over it and they assembled it and put the lechon inside. Unbelievable!!!!"}
{"text":"Well where do I begin? Probably build the credibility for this one star post first -- well, I am Filipina. I was raised feeding off authentic Filipino home cooked meals and desserts. From the signature KareKare to Kilawin to Kutsinta, I've had my fair share of Filipino delicacy. Buying Filipino food for me is rare since Mom can make almost anything at home. So if there's something that I particularly crave that my mom couldn't make, then I go look for a superb Filipino place. Heavenly Bakeshop is not the superb place that I was looking for.   Compared to my usual Manila Sunrise Restaurant, prices of Heavenly Bakeshop were a tad bit higher. I noticed meals such as Sisig were individually packed, priced and stored inside the transparent fridge. Why put the supposed to be hot meals inside the fridge? I don't know. And I'm never buying those.   One of my favorite desserts was on the other fridge - Sapin Sapin. I got super excited cos I haven't had it in a while. When I got home, I was disappointed since it didn't have its usual sticky and smooth texture. What I got was like powdery and paste-y rolled into one. And the flavor? Non-existent. Colors were pretty though, but I didn't buy them for decorations.   When I was still in HB, I saw one of the servers put out a hot batch of \"Carioca\". I've only heard of these when I lived in the Philippines and like the Sapin Sapin it looked incredibly delicious. When I got home and took my first bite, excess oil oozed out. Gross. And the sugar tasted bitter. So while I was trying to chew the Carioca, all I tasted was Canola and burnt sugar. Pretty bad.   Still hoping that my trip to HB wasn't a huge mistake, I turned to my \"Special\" Halo Halo.  Looks good once again. Leche Flan Check. Ube Check. So far so good. I kept mixing every ingredient in preparation of the first critical bite. Lo and behold there was not a single taste of sweetness -- at all. Idk if they forgot to put sugar (one of the main ingredients of it) or really opted not to, which was stupid since it's a dessert. Probably so you can control your own sweetness? It still doesn't make sense since it SHOULD be sweet. And if that was the case then they couldv'e easily told me. But wow I was extremely disappointed. To top it all off, as if the bad couldn't get worse, I found an insect, drowned in my sugarless treat. Yaaaaay. Not.   All in all, will I be back? Seriously, why would I be? If you're Filipino, Filipino food in America should make you miss home. It should give you comfort and make you relive memories. Heavenly Bakeshop failed to do that for me. Oh well. 3 strikes (Carioca, Sapinsapin, Halohalo) and you're out as what they say."}
{"text":"I had stopped in also after stopping at lee lees to buy ingredients for home made Turon.  I was hoping to god they had my ensymada rolls with ube or macapuno in the middle but no luck.  I did however see a turnover with ube in it and also a roll with macapuno for 1.25 and 1.35.  I bought one of each and took them home to try them out.  The lady did not speak to me much and i had to say hello upon entering and what not. For some reasons Cebuanos tend to be more friendly towards me than i have had experiences with tagalog speaking filipinos.  I wore my manny pacquaio hoodie zip up but apparently she did not see the emblem.    As i got home i took the ube turnover out and took a bite. First initial reaction: Where is the ube???? Second reaction:  Why is the pastry part not sweeter?  I used to work at safeway bakerys and loved loved loved the turnovers and could not imagine why this did not wow me not only looking just like a triangle shaped turnover with sugar on top but it had ube in it! Should be wowing me at least!  As for the macapuno turnover that looked like a pastry roll was very similar to the ube turnover just differently shaped.  i had to eat the top layer pull out the middle layer and the macapuno itself lacked a flavor the texture was there but not the flavor. I think i was so spoiled with goldilocks back home that nothing else can come close. If this bakery starts producing some red bean swirl loafs or ube rolls that are soft and decadent i will be more than happy and a satisfied customer but until then i will be on the look out for a filipino bakery that has at least one of my favorites whether it be ube or red bean bread, ube ensymada, or even some turon and carioca.  This bakeshop had all the little things i did not consume the most of at my aunts house parties. If they could combine the ube the kutsinta and the white doughy rice cakes like goldilocks has too i would even settle! If you are filipino or half like i am and know of some better places i would appreciate any information leading me to a more satisfied ending than what i have tried. =]"}
{"text":"Tried to call in an order, and told the person on the phone I wanted pancit but with certain veggies withheld. He seemed confused, and said he \"couldn't do that\". So I thanked him and hung up. I guess he's not used to catering to customers' preferences."}
{"text":"This place had the worst customer service and the bakery goods is super dry. Please proceed to the next Filipino bakery."}
{"text":"Great lumpia and awesome service. Thanks for doing a huge order with very short notice!"}
{"text":"Lechon!  I had heard of this delicious pork dish from watching travel shows, and was excited to see they sold it here.  I got a pound to go, and it was all that I hoped it would be!  The pork is slow roasted for a long time to get a very crispy and crunchy skin, kind of like a pork chip!  The meat was very tender and full of flavor (And fat!  Don't think for a minute this is healthy for you!)  They included a special tangy-sweet gravy to dip the lechon in, which was wonderful.  I did not try any of the pastries, but they did look delectable.  They also sell chicharron for those that want to snack on something pork-like as well.    The lady at the counter was very nice and friendly.  If I want to go into a pork-coma again this is the place to go!  Lechon: $8.50 per pound, sold on the weekends Chicharron: ~$2 for 2 ounces"}
{"text":"We ordered a 30-35 lb LECHON for $300 and we were greatly disappointed. The lechon was burnt and overlooked and the skin was not crispy at all. When we first picked up the lechon order, we didn't really check it but upon cutting into it, we discovered that it was burnt and skin was soggy."}
{"text":"I love Filipino food.  Ever since ginger root decided to close.  I've been looking for a good Filipino restaurant and I think this is the place.  Sisig over rice.  Lechon laing and the desserts are on poooooint. Always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Lechon.   'Nuff said. you can get lechon on the weekends by the pound and we got two pounds with lots of crunchy skin! So good. Worth it!   Of course when we were there I saw all the desserts and couldn't resist. Not the best bakery, but I enjoyed getting to eat Filipino desserts while I was in Phoenix.   Lechon, go get it!"}
{"text":"I ordered lechon from this Heavenly Restaurant. It was the worst lechon I ever tasted in my entire life. When lechon is served in Filipino gatherings, they do not last long - if it tastes like the lechon that Filipinos wanted. Not even a quarter of the lechon I ordered from Heavenly was consumed. A testimony to the worst kind of lechon this restaurant offers. Plus I ordered and paid for one that is between 40 to 45 pounds live weight for $365.00 The one delivered to me was about 30 pounds live weight or less.   I also ordered Sisig for $60.00 for a small aluminum tray. This is the first time I've seen and tasted sisig like this - with sabaw. The same thing happened - my sisig lover friends did not even bother with the dish.  If you want to get ripped off like I was and make the same costly mistake I made, then patronize this restaurant. Please do not. This restaurant is the worst."}
{"text":"I pre-ordered my lechon and prepaid for New Year's Eve.  I came to pick it up and she said she made a mistake and now I have nothing but returned prepayment. Thanks a lot for ruining New Year's Eve.  Worst customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"I go here every other week to get my Filipino food fix.  I always order take out as seating is limited at best - very small space with most of it crammed with tables and display racks filled with bakery and Filipino snack foods.  They have prepared foods that you can buy in refrigerated display cases - which I haven't tried primarily because I think ~$7 for a small plastic container's worth is a bit much, but I do have my favorite food items which they do very well - hence the 3 stars.  Customer service? Nah - the owner is what I would call \"masungit\" ."}
{"text":"A Filipino bakery in Arizona? Yes!  Stopped in after shopping for groceries at the Lee Lee's in the same complex and buying drinks at the Boba Tea House down the row.  Stepped in and was surprised to find ube, pan de sal, manapua, empanadas, and even adobo.  Very tasty and reminded me of Hawai'i.  Definitely worth the visit and food fix."}
{"text":"I finally was able to try this place out.  We ordered the cheese bread, pork BBQ, soipao, and the fried bangos.   The cheese bread is amazing.  The pork BBQ was ok.  The meat was too lean.  The soipao would be perfect but there was barely any meat. The fried bangos had too many fish bones.  It was too much work so I did not eat it.   The service was excellent and the employees were really nice.  If they put more meat in the soipao I would definitely buy it again and even pay a little more."}

{"text":"Stopped here mid-afternoon on a weekday for pandesal. They had a large selection, but asked if I was willing to wait 5 minutes for fresh ones. Waiting for the pandesal, I purchased an Ube Roll and Brazo de Mercedes. Everything had a traditional flavor and was fairly fresh except for the Ube Roll."}
