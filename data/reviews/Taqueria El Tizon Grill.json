{"text":"The tacos are really good and the seating area is clean. They have improved since I last ate here."}
{"text":"I always come here but they got new staff and now the food just taste generic it's sad because I used to spend like 30 bucks a week here I guess those 30 bucks are back in my pocket goodbye tizon hello tacos El Gordo"}
{"text":"The food is really not good specially since i know what authentic mexican food tastes like. Would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Best carne asada tacos I've had in Vegas hands down they come with beans! Their chicken tacos are also really good! Amazing customer service. Next time I will add guacamole and cheese to my tacos!"}
{"text":"Best carne asada in town by far and their al pastor is off the hook! Must try if you are on this side of town"}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY! 
Service: Terrible! We got there at 9pm and  their hours showed that they closed at 10pm. This didn't matter to the staff-who locked the doors at 9:07, put the salsa trays away and pretty much closed shop around us by 9:20. 

Food: Not that great. I love al pastor fries and will try them first at any taqueria. But these were  bottom of the barrel fries to say the least. Sour cream was slightly curdled, avocado tasted at least 1 day old, fries were drenched in grease and the meat was dry and somewhat crispy!

Overall: I'm pretty sure inside the restaurant was hotter than it was outside! (102F today)
I will never go back and I would advise anyone else the same!"}
{"text":"The food is great.  My favorite is the carne asada.  Anything you eat will be good, except for any vegetarian adaptations.  I order some bean and cheese tortas because I was not in the mood for meat and one cook made it good while another cook did a horrible job.  I could've done better at home.  If you stick to what is on the menu you should be okay.  The place is really small so if you're claustrophobic or come with a group you should order to go.  Portions are good and everything is fresh right down to the sauces in the mini bar.  Like Mike said, the shopping center is in a bad location so come early."}
{"text":"This place is good! There aren't many places to get real tacos in 89108. Cheap and delicious. I had carne asada and al pastor, both to my satisfaction. They put beans on top of the carne asada tacos which I'm not used to, but enjoyed. Salsa bar and pickled vegetables like Robertto's or any other taco shop."}
{"text":"I come here almost every weekend. I love the food! Plus it's inexpensive as well. The food is freshly made. The beans are cooked from scratch. I only get the boiled ones lol! The menudo is a great hit on the weekends. The cooking is consistent since it's the same two cooks from ages ago. On occasion you might see a new cashier."}
{"text":"Service isnt that great probably not coming here again due to the fact that their food is a gamble its either good or its terrible and im not willing to gamble my money on food..."}
{"text":"Taqueria El Tizon Grill currently has three locations in the valley. I first experienced their food at the new westside location in the Savers/99 Cent Store plaza at Cheyenne and Rancho, and I was impressed. If you get a chance to check them out today or tomorrow (September 28-29), you can score grand opening specials of $0.75 tacos (any meat) or $3 for four tacos and a fountain drink! You could pay almost $3 for a single taco at Tacos El Gordo or Los Tacos. If you're reading this after September 29, the tacos cost $1.25.

The interior of the restaurant looks nice and clean. I took my food to go, but dining in is a good option so you can make return trips to the salsa bar. There was a mountain of really tasty grilled onions and jalapenos, four salsas, and a few other options. The woman at the cash register was very friendly and spoke perfect English. I ordered super nachos without meat for myself and a $3 taco plate for my husband. Meat options include al pastor (roasting on a spit in the kitchen), barbacoa (a house specialty), carne asada, chicken, lengua, cabeza, and chorizo. They double up the very small corn tortillas, but they don't skimp on the meat portions. He really enjoyed his tacos, and my nachos were great. The tortilla chips came topped with shredded cheese, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, and lots of pinto beans (refried also available). The pico and guacamole were lacking citrus flavor, but some lime wedges from the salsa bar could fix that. Cherry Fanta is a fountain drink option, which reminds me of drinking Shirley Temples. Best of all, our tab was only $8.36!

There's a lot more on the menu to try, so we'll be back for huaraches, crispy potato tacos, aguas frescas, and chile relleno burritos. El Tizon is open from 9am-9:30pm Monday-Thursday and 9am-10pm Friday-Sunday."}
{"text":"nice staff good tacos, great flavor salsas!"}
{"text":"My wife got diarrhea pretty bad after eating from this place. The meat was chewy, the rice and beans tasted old and cheap like from a can. Nothing really tasted good except maybe  the fries out of my carne asada fries. I would prefer Robertos to place any day, and I don't like Robertos..."}
{"text":"I almost didn't want to write a review because I don't want many people to find out about this jewel! I love this place the food is soooooo good ! I've had nearly everything on the menu. The neighborhood isn't so nice that's why they've recently changed their hours but nevertheless the food is GREAT! I would suggest the huarache, the pastor tacos and honestly, anything else !!"}
{"text":"Consistently great tacos, but you'll drive right past El Tizon if you're not careful.  The tacos are wonderful: hot and fresh.  You can get them individually with your choice of carne asada or chicken (of course), but be especially sure to try the tacos al pastor with everything.  Hungrier than that?  You can also get plates, burritos, nachos, menudo etc.  The menu is surprisingly large for such a small place.

The price is definitely right and the staff is always friendly.  If you work or live on the north east side, be sure to swing by.  El Tizon may just be your new favorite place to grab tacos.  Oh, and your taste buds and wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"We live up on the Northwest part of town and basically have no options for \"street\" style tacos. Even though Taqueria El Tizon isn't really NW, I wouldn't say driving here from any part of town would be worth it. Like others have mentioned, they do have good pricing but that's where the good stops. 

My son and I ordered 7 tacos to share, 5 of them were al pastor. This was easily the driest meat I've ever gotten at a taco shop. I could have dealt with the dryness if it at least had some flavor. It was lacking flavor completely and the fixings didn't help in any way. Neither the onion or cilanto were fresh and the pineapple was definitely sitting out for a long time.

For the other tacos, we went with carne asada which seemed to get okay reviews and that's exactly what they are...okay. The meat was nowhere near as dry as the al pastor but still basically flavorless. They also top them with beans, onions and cilantro. Just like the other tacos, the fixings were far from fresh and the beans were just about as dry as the meat. 

I was close to giving this two stars because of the carne asada but the service was terrible and this restaurant is friggin nasty. There's trash all over the floor, the salsa bar was a disaster and none of the tables were clean. Then to top it off, when the cashier/waitress brought out our food, she dropped a whole piece of my wifes quesadilla on the dirty table then just left it there. Accidents happen, no biggie. But to just leave it on the table is stupid and is exactly why the restaurant is so dirty. She just didn't care...and I don't care to ever come back!"}
{"text":"My second time here. The pastor tacos are under cooked. My huarache is so hard. They have really bad service. The cashier was mad. Never. NEVER COMING BACK."}
{"text":"I order a burrito it was very good and the red hot salsa was so yummy also good customer service"}
{"text":"Tacos were ok not the best I would give it a better review but the cashier seemed like she didn't want to be there made no eye contact once with any of her customers or with us when ordering, not only that the vibe in the place was off I understand people get tired of working but there attitude made it so hard to enjoy the food."}

In A Sentence
It's way better than anything else around here. (There ain't much.)

Quick Review
+   Great location within striking distance of CSN North Las Vegas.

+/- Food is alright. You aren't asking anyone to freeze it and ship it to you via courier service if you are in Antarctica with Cathy C. 

-    Restrooms are atrocious. Worse than the worst truck stop in Arkansas.

Pro Tip: Find it in the CitiTrends, Family Dollar, Super Pawn, O'Reilly Auto Parts-anchored shopping centre, next to Domino's®.

Pro Tip: One of the fast food places that actually have desserts (in the desert). Pide el flancito.

Pro Tip: No hay cerveza. 

It's alright. You get a shitton of food for a relatively small amount of money. No pesos accepted. 

They've always treated me well here. It's a small place; not a lot of non-Spanish speakers coming through. Everyone is welcome though.

Get the pollo or asada. Be kind, rewind. 

No tourists here and that is fine. It's pretty far from the strip after all.

Not good for kids*. (*Unless your kids are Mexican.)

{"text":"Best taqueria in North Vegas, period. Maybe even all of Vegas. I usually go with tres azada tacos , dos de pollo and dos al pastor. Get some guacamole too, which they serve in a styrofoam coffee cup. Wash everything down with a mandarin jarritos mexican soda, and you'll be golden! This place is the bomb, and reasonably priced. Sketchy shopping center though."}
{"text":"Great tacos, quick service cheap prices. It's tough to find quality lunch options in north town (that aren't Chipotle, Five Guys, etc!), so I'm always happy to hear about any locally-owned joints in the Nellis area. 
The burritos here are really popular, but they're too huge for me, so I stick to the tacos. Steak, carnitas, asada are all delicious, but the standout is definitely the al pastor. If you're in the area, El Tizon is worth a look!"}
{"text":"This place is money, anyone who says otherwise is wrong! Al pastor tacos for the win!"}
{"text":"WOW! Possibly the Best Tacos EVER!! They put beans on the carne asada tacos!! The El pastor was crispy and juicy! Thank you Carlos for your excellent service! And a big THANK YOU to the cook!"}
{"text":"Came here expecting decent tacos. When you first walk in the place is small and doesn't really look all that clean but decided to try the place out regardless. The staff was okay, asked what she recommended and just gave a stereotypical answer of the 'Carne Asada Taco'. Decided to try them out by adding cheese as a twist. The cheese ISNT real cheese and just looks like plastic. The salsa is terrible. Overall the meat was okay. Tried the Carne Asada, Pastor and the Grilled Chicken. If you can find a better place, do."}
{"text":"I know this is gonna sound a bit HARSH, especially considering the LOW prices here.

I only tried the tacos.  They have A LOT on their menu, so maybe they specialize in that OTHER stuff more than the tacos themselves...

First of all, the tacos and cheap.  Probably some of the cheapest in town at around a buck and a quarter.  They are very small street tacos style, double tortilla.  Just figure how many you usually eat, and add 50% more to get full.  But at the low prices, that's acceptable.

Started off with the Al Pastor....DRY and CRISPY...their rotisserie wasn't spinning, and it was OVERCOOKING the meat!!  I don't believe I've EVER had a dry Al Pastor...there is usually plenty of fat in the marinade, slowly cooking on the spit, and constantly dripping down those juices on the rest of the meat.  Not this one.

Yes, the tacos are small and inexpensive, but they are a little SKIMPY on the pineapple...ONE CHUNK??  Look at the pic to see what I am talking about....I had ONE small piece of pineapple on my entire taco.  At least mince my single tiny piece to make it look like there is more on my taco!

The Asada was better. I thought their Asada was good, but it was also DRY...they probably have it cooked already and let it sit on the stove to keep warm.

They forgot my Chorizo taco I ordered, and when I told the lady that brought out our food, I presumed she was going to bring me one.  Well she never did, so I had to go back up there and requested one.  I presumed I would be put in the front of the list considering I already paid, already had ALL the rest of my food, and I was standing there waiting for my SINGLE taco...but I waited for almost 5min before it came out.  Yeah, for a taco.

Too bad it wasn't worth the wait...the Chorizo was super dry, no fat/grease/oil at all...I don't even think my tortilla turned that beautiful orange hue I love in Chorizo.  Yes, THAT dry.

Why is all the meat dry??  You guys were BUSY today...grand opening weekend!  Shouldn't everything be FRESH right now??  What's it gonna be like 4 months from now, at 8pm and you're the only customer there??
