{"text":"Sumo Lounge is located in Eau Claire Mall in Calgary.  Their food is really good.  Their prices are pretty high for some items.

The sushi they serve is really good and you can get it to go for lunch which makes it nice to just grab lunch and go.

The only unfortunate thing about this place is their service.  Many many times I have gone there and had horrible service, but I craved sushi!  

I have had the same waitress many times and either she is just interested in getting awsome tips from the cute guys who come in or she really doesnt care about her job.  She has many times seated us and never come back!  I've had to get up and go ask if we can order....then after ordering ...have had to ask when our food will come.  We have had to get our food put into take out containers after sitting and waiting our entire lunch hour for our food!!

I have many complaints about this one waitress, but in the end the food is great, so we suck it up and just go for dinner or get take out instead.

The times that they are the most busy are lunch hour during the week.  If you go for dinner you will find the place empty and then the service is perfect!"}
{"text":"Good food, service bit down since they moved to new location within the Mall."}
{"text":"I was scared to try this place because of some of the poor reviews! Maybe they've improved since then because everything was really good for us. Our family of 4 purchased the Groupon deal and made the reservation for a Friday night. They were friendly & welcoming - no problem with the Groupon coupon whatsoever. She said anything we'd like off the menu they'll honour that $ amount. Service was fast, friendly and very professional. The food was much better than we anticipated! Not the best we've ever had, but still very good sushi. We had sashimi, sushi and assorted rolls and of course miso soup. Excellent miso soup. The sashimi we were given were very generous pieces ( unlike previous reviews). Also, our daughter is Celiac and they were very attentive with her about ensuring hers is gluten free and brought her a gluten free soya sauce as well.  Maybe they stepped it up?? We'd definitely return"}
{"text":"We love sushi and often find ourselves in a sushi bar on date night enjoying new sushi creations from different restaurants. We thought we would try the sumo lounge before a movie at Eau Claire and were very pleasantly surprised when we found this treasure! The restaurant at first glance seems narrow and crowded, but once you are seated the comfy chairs and carefully selected decor take over! 
We ordered a sushi boat and it was ready in seriously 10 minutes. I couldn't believe it and immediately thought \"oh oh\", this is freezer sushi and it won't be fresh. I was seriously mistaken and this was not only fresh but some of the best sushi I have had east of the mountains!
We were even further surprised when our bill arrived! We had a sushi boat, tea and another mango salmon sushi dish with a side of volcano sauce including a decent tip/GST for less than $20 per person! 
We will definitely be taking friends here in the near future and this is now one of our favourite sushi hangouts!"}
{"text":"stopped in late Saturday afternoon after the golf show and while we were the first table it was full when we left. Started with Kirin beer and spring rolls (don't waste your time and $ - there was six flat small parcels with virtually nothing in and jarred plum sauce. We did however really enjoy their special dynamite roll and bbq eel roll both very tasty and ended up leaving full."}
{"text":"Mango Salmon Roll is the best!! Just got back from a nice evening at Sumo, I was hesitating to go there at first but got surprised, Service was great, food was fresh and just great, the place is so comfortable and cozy !!  Awesome place for sushi, especially here in Calgary, so few of them nice places."}
{"text":"I used to love going to Sumo, a frequent customer, however the place has gone down hill recent years. Their fish was not fresh (The Sumo House roll has a rotten fish smell, tasted like they just mix a bunch of un-fresh minced fish in the Sumo House Roll), the rice quality was inconsistent (some over-cooked soggy, some hard like it's been out for a while and got dried up).
The California roll was a joke, I know it's mixed with mayo, but it truly looks like there's only mayo in the roll, no crab, no avocado whatsoever, because the lack of solid substance in the mixture, the mayo just ooze out of the rice, not a pretty sight, and the taste was worse than it looks, it's just sushi rice/mayo, for the kind of money I pay at this restaurant, this was ridiculous, the sushi section at Sobey's provide better sushi than you!

It saddens me but I have lost hope on Sumo Lounge at Eau Claire, one of my fav sushi spots (years ago) in Calgary, not even the Groupon offers would lore me to your place anymore.

They also used to hire some friendly staff, now just a middle aged couple running the place ( I believe they're the owners), last few times I went there's zero customers, guess everyone got the memo. Only lil ol' me still believing in it. Well today it was the last straw. \"B\" for BAD.

Goodbye Sumo."}
{"text":"Over-priced, worse than fast-food! I couldn't believe they can price their Chicken Katsu that much and serve superdry chicken that you know has been in the freezer for too long. I'm extremely disappointed because the one in Sunridge is a favorite go to place."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi. Courteous waitress. You might have to wait for service though when they are really busy."}
{"text":"Came here because of a groupon on a Friday after work.  It was pretty dead, only 1 or 2 other tables were occupied. Ordered 4 rolls and the salmon/tuna sashimi.  The sashimi was actually decently sized...thick and fresh!  The sumo roll was large and delicious.  We also ordered the green dragon, which was great as well.  Overall it was a good experience!  Didn't know why people said it wasn't good.  We will probably come here again!  Maybe with another groupon haha"}
{"text":"Spent my first non Toronto groupon!! Yay for getting a deal =) 

First impresssions, the service was a good sign as the wait staff was fairly good at balancing attention and enjoying the evening.

Onto the main attraction, picked up an appy, a main and a drink. The ocean seaweed salad was great, a well sized and flavorfully balanced dish! I definitely recommend this one. The main was a salmons sashimi (10 pieces) which was a large portion and definitely filled me up. Paired this with some organic sake. Though it would have been better paired with a heavier dish.

Would consider returning if I am in Calgary, though it is not a must visit."}
{"text":"So the food is excellent. Very nicely prepared sushi! I love sushi and can be a harsh critic but this place is excellent! I also like the staff. The owner is a nice guy - always friendly"}
{"text":"Service was lacking. Food quality was a solid \"meh\". It wasn't bad but definitely didn't stand out. Rather eat grocery store sushi."}
{"text":"With many Sushi restaurants in Calgary, it's easy to compare one from the others. Sumo's food is good, not the best. But the #1 thing they could improve on is service; I'm sure if they added at least one more server, customers would be happier. Sorry Sumo, everytime I go there I always have to flag a waitress anytime I need something. 3/5"}
{"text":"Worst experience! No wonder everytime we pass by the place it's mostly empty.. food sucks! It's quite expensive and service aint great either... I was expecting the same quality of service and food like the one in Sunridge. This one just fell flat on it's face for me.

We came in thirsty and starving and we were THE only customers they had for that time being. There were 2 guys on the front bar (where I think they make sushi) talking to each other..  one lady approached us to give the menu and left 2 tiny glass of water (while there were 3 of us) and went rights straight to the back kitchen.. we quickly settled on our preferences yet we waited an unnecessarily long time for her to come back.. hungry, we waived at the guys at the bar (that doesn't seem to notice us at all, they're just there talking) to get their attention that we're  ready to place an order. I was expecting one of them to come to us and get our order yet they went to the kitchen and let the other lady know that we're ready to order. Lazy f*ktards.. ugh I'll just get straight to the point..

We got our orders in decent time BUT my order specifically had rice, some fried chicken (white meat) with some kind of sweet sauce, and a sunny side egg... I couldn't remember the name on their menu.. I should've taken a picture of the whole bowl when I received it. But we were so hungry I/we chowed down on our food when we got them.. but I would like to personally complain about my plate. The description I would put eating that fried chicken was like eating a paper mache! Dry, dull, tasteless, chewy hard piece of paper. I also posted a picture of it (just scroll through it, and try to zoom in, see if you can squeeze some moisture on that chicken). The sunny side egg is burnt!! Eggs! BURNT EGGS!! I was honestly doubting the credibility of their chef! Why oh why.. they're fricking eggs! I was looking forward to the beautiful meal that I've been longing from Sumo at Sunridge. Yet this is what we got!

I normally let little things go specially when it comes to restaurants because one way or another, most of the pros outweighs the cons, mostly resolving to a decent meal or a nice try experience regardless of the price. But this one IS ridiculously over priced, lazy staffed, and uncaring Chefs. That's 3 Strikes!! therefore I don't believe this place even deserve a freaking star. You should give your star to Sunridge Sumo. DON'T EAT HERE."}
{"text":"A bit slow on getting you food but it's so good. They have lots of tables inside the actual restaurant and they have an outside patio and one in the mall. Kinda weird they are closed from 2-5pm. Love their yam tempura rolls."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, but service was mediocre. I also found the prices to be quite high for what was offered (but maybe I'm spoiled living in Vancouver, the land of inexpensive delicious sushi)"}
{"text":"GROUPON USERS BEWARE !


Arrived with the family at 5 P.M. for dinner. Were seated right away, but it took a few minutes before a waitress showed up. I proceeded to tell the waitress, that I would be using a Groupon. (Mistake ?). The waitress then took our drink order, then a few minutes later told me that If I was going to use a Groupon, that I should've called ahead and told them. The waitress then proceeded to tell me that since we were already at the restaurant that she would honour the Groupon. The waitress then told me that some servers wouldn't even accept the Groupon.    WTF ????????? I paid for this Groupon and it should be treated the same as cash. I seem to remember another review, saying that a Groupon they were using was not to be used for the daily special. I say again WTF ???????? 
The unfortunate thing is, I purchased two of these things and I have to go back another time. I may call Groupon to have a refund issued.
Getting to the food itself, the sushi we ordered was \"not bad\", and the teriyaki steak entree I ordered was mediocre at best. The teriyaki sauce on top of the steak was salty, not sweet like I have had at other restos.

In conclusion, will I return to this place ?  If I can't get a refund on my Groupon, then I guess I'll have no choice. Either that or forfit the money."}
{"text":"This is a tourist trap of a Japanese restaurant. The offerings are standard faire and prices are above average, but I guess to be expected in downtown. The food itself was pretty underwhelming especially considering the high cost, and coupled with the inattentive service (on a non-busy week night) makes it a no-go for me."}
{"text":"Well I was very pleased with this place. Sushi is still very new and dangerous to me so I was a little cautious of what to get. We got the calamari, sumo house rolls, mango salmon rolls, spicy tuna, and Alaskan rolls. 

Ok first off, fruit and fish....YUM. I didn't think that would work but it sure did. Spicy tuna; well you can't go wrong with spicy tuna. The calamari wasn't chewy, which is good because apparently chewy calamari isn't preferable. The other two rolls were good but nothing to write yelp about :). I got a Corona and was surprised at how good the price was for a restaurant. 

Overall I was very pleased.  The only issue was the wasabi bomb I had but otherwise I left unscathed from my daring and dangerous sushi outing."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon we've eaten here twice. Was definitely a great deal.  we got great service, great food served in a pretty wooden boat.  Loved it.  Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"I just adore this place because for the money you pay you are getting your bucks worth. I am usually here if I need my sushi fix downtown cause unlike some other sushi places downtown they don't try to empty out your pockets.

I have been here during dinner as well as during lunch and the service is always the same, great! The wait is never long and the servers here are super cute and friendly, what more could you want right?

I see that some other yelpers think the servers here are dressed inappropriately and I can't really see why they would say that? The girls here usually just wear a black tee with a black skirt and some kind shoes or boots. They look super cute as I said previously, oh I see why now! *sarcasm*"}
{"text":"I don't believe I was duped into going to this restaurant by Groupon.  I was beyond disappointed with the prices and food.  Firstly, the prices were outrageous.  There is no way that the type of food that was served at this restaurant warranted these exorbitant prices.  Secondly, the food was abhorrent.  I am now suffering with stomach pains that are unbelievable.  The tempura was questionable.  The batter was non-existent on the vegetables and looked like something that a Chinese cook would have dreamed up.  Although the vegetables were deep fried, it was definitely not a tempura.  The rice on the sushi was not cooked properly and the sushi vinegar was lacking.  This made for a very unpleasant experience when we ordered three rolls and one large sushi platter.  I would give this restaurant a 1 star out of 5.  This is only because the decor was nice and service was good (we were the only party in the restaurant).  This type of restaurant needs to close down because it not only gives Japanese food a bad name, it gives \"food\" in general a bad name.  I am very angry because of my experience and lack of value (\"rip off\")."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS

This place was so horrendously bad. I don't even know how to explain all the ways our experience was crap without having to write an essay. The restaurant was pretty much dead, there were maybe two other tables and our table of 5 at the restaurant. There was nobody to greet us, and it wasn't clear whether we should seat ourselves or if somebody was going to seat us. We just ended up seating ourselves. 
We sat there for a good while before any water came, but it was fine. The man who took our order (after a long wait might I add) literally was scribbling down what we said on an old receipt, using his hand instead of a clipboard or something. Honestly, at that point we should've had enough warning signs and left. 
We ordered 2 miso soups, 1 house salad, 3 rolls, 2 poke don bowls, 1 crab, 1 rice bowl/eel thing, and 2 takoyaki orders. (this is just what I remembered. They messed things up so horribly bad that at this point I can't remember what they've forgotten or accidentally given us and what we actually asked for- this was two days ago)

1. The food took ages to come, and they came in a ridiculous order. For example, the last thing we received, nearly 1.5 hours after ordering, was our miso soups and house salad. And we had to remind them constantly about it. 

2. The food came out not only in an awkward order, but in such a way that we couldn't even all eat together. Half of us would have our food but then some other people would be hungrily waiting for ages for theirs. 

3. The bowls were dirty. There was old food/sauce/rice on the bottom of the outside of some bowls. 

4. They got our orders wrong. They tried to give us some croquette things instead of the takoyaki, and we had to correct them. They also had to continuously come back and re-ask us what we ordered, probably because they scribbled the orders on an old receipt. They also gave us a tempura roll although we ordered a spicy salmon roll and at that point we let it be known it was wrong but it was the only thing they'd brought out after over an hour so we just ate it. 

5. They almost never refilled our water. 

6. On top of the horrible service, the food was bad and outrageously priced for the shitty quality. The takoyaki was OBVIOUSLY prefrozen and probably microwaved to be honest so I don't know why it took ages to get to us. It was soggy as well. The sushi rolls left a lot to be desired. The crab was soggy and extremely tiny for $13. The poke don bowls were ridiculously coated in sauce and super salty. The eel rice bowl hardly had any eel in it. 

And in the end, no refund, nothing was comp'd, no coupon, NOT EVEN AN APOLOGY. They seriously didn't give a fuck that we waited super long for our food and all the orders were fucked up. In fact they tried to make us pay for the croquettes that we DIDNT ORDER NOR DID WE EAT. Also, we were there for like over 2 hours and the table of family who left shortly before we arrived was STILL not bussed by the time we left. These people don't give a fuck. Not about the service, not about the food, not about anything. There were like 3 tables of people the entire time and the service was so bad, imagine if it was actually busy?!

I hope this restaurant shuts down forever, and the people working here find careers in things they actually want to do because obviously running a restaurant isn't what they want to do."}
{"text":"I've gone to this particular restaurant many times over the past two years since I work a block away from there and I need my sushi fix from time to time. 

I'm giving this restaurant 3 starts not for the food (the food is great!) but the lack of customer service the waitresses at this place have. I have many times have walked in after lunch time (1pm) having to wait for several minutes, not one waitress makes any eye contact what-so-ever and instead they rush by me several times. I have then had to seat myself at the bar. Minutes go by and I'm trying to flag down anyone at this point (ridiculous!!) just to get a menu. Finally I get one slammed on my table and they run off again without asking if I want water. It takes another 5minutes to flag another one of them down so I can order my food. I usually ask for miso soup, a roll and green tea. Today for example after 10 minutes after they took the order the chef brought the sushi himself, when I mentioned that I was still waiting for my soup, he went to the back and got it himself. The waitress then ran past me and threw the cup of green tea and disappeared again. No one came to check on me to see even if the food was ok or if I wanted more green tea. Whatever! When I finally flagged the waitress down to pay for my bill, I gave a big ZERO for her tip. I do not tip for order takers and that's what these so called waitresses are, simply order pickers. I wanted to give it to the chef since it was him who did all the leg work plus the sushi but I knew if I included it in my transaction the waitress would take the bigger portion without her doing any of the actual work. Sorry chef, I promise I'll take care of you next time. 

My experience when doing takeouts is exactly the same. Wait at entrance, flag someone down, take my order, except now this time my food sits by the register for several minutes, these so called waitresses are so distracted counting their tips, closing their tables, changing into their \"regular\" clothes because they are dying to get out, until I literally have to go right up to the register and almost grab the bag of food myself. TO THE OWNER OF SUMO, if it wasn't for your good chefs, you would go bankrupt. Cute asian girls dressed in tiny little outfits might cut it for the common guy who only uses 1% of his brain, but some of us who know of good customer service would not be back. Unfortunately for me, this is the only  sushi place close by for me during the week. But I just won't tip them, nuf said!"}
{"text":"So we went to Sumo last night for dinner with another couple. We got to sit on the patio, which I've never done at a sushi place and it was wonderful! Perfect temperature. 

The service was ok, little slow to get our actual sushi, but we weren't in a rush, so for us it wasn't a big deal. 

The pill was a little pricier than usual, but we did order alcoholic drinks, and we usually don't. 

The server assured me the food I ordered was GF, so that was positive, I did have a slight tummy ache after, but I ate a lot sushi! 

All the fish was fresh, it tasted great and perfect size pieces. 

I don't usually like to go downtown after working hours (I spend enough time there), but I will definitely be back in I'm hankering sushi that requires meeting friends at a central location."}
{"text":"On January 18th,  my husband and I went there just before our movie at Eau Claire.  We asked to be seated at the sushi bar.  We waited over 20 minutes and no one acknowledged us, not even the suchi chefs who were directly in front of us.  So we left.  Upon walking out, I told the hostess we were not served and she said nothing - Just stunned!  Unfortunately that evening, no one seemed to care about the business."}
{"text":"I usually write reviews, but I rarely write to TADDLE ON SOMEONE. Ergo.

On Tuesday, March 25th just before 8:40, we sat down at the restaurant in which...look just read Sarah Louise's review...she pretty much breaks down the event that left such a sour taste in our mouths that we RESOLVE TO NEVER GO TO BACK TO ANY RESTAURANTS NAMED SUMO LOUNGE. In fact I'm never going back to any place that has a sumo name to it, or lounge, I might even raise hell if I suddenly see a LOUNGE OF SUMO set up in Calgary. Way to ruin such a cool concept for me BLONDE GIRL.

The blonde young girl seemed eager to leave one hour early in the night. I'm not sure if she was the manager or some manipulating alpha female, but I doubt she was in any position to be making that sort of call. She must've been in a hurry to meet up with her friends or whatever it is human weeds like her do.

Also yeah I'm going to be calling Sumo Lounge, I'd seen enough foodnetwork shows on nightmare restaurant staff to know someone's business is in jeopardy."}
{"text":"Horrible service but good food, don't go if you expect timely service. Had to wait over an hour just to get a beer or our food"}
{"text":"My all time fave due to location. 
Sushi is ok, sometimes even great, other times the rice falls apart.
Service is usually slow.... very slow...."}
{"text":"I wish there were rating of less than one star...  Last night I was served a prawn that was rotten.  

On my last visit I was served a roll straight out of the fridge, too cold. Last nights rotten prawn fiasco settles it. Never again will I eat at this restaurant. 

What makes it worse is that the server, after speaking with the manager, let me know that \"sometimes the prawns are hard to judge\".  Perhaps their chefs are in the wrong line of work."}
{"text":"Big meh. Service was okay. We got our soup right away but our actual order took ages. Overall not terribly impressed."}
{"text":"We haven't been here for quite a while, and I have to say this place has really gone downhill. We ordered two bento boxes. The pork and chicken Katsu was bland, hard and was clearly reheated. The only special thing about the accompanying \"special\" roll was that it contained no animal protein. Remember, \"special\" doesn't always mean \"good\". Service was ok, but doesn't fill you up!

 That was my last visit to this once adequate sushi place."}
{"text":"Service is always terrible. Girls are usually rude, distracted, dressed unprofessionally, and just to dumb to understand what you want.

Thankfully, their food isn't half bad. If you're looking for reasonably priced sushi in the Eau Claire area, this place wins by default. You definitely wouldn't find me rushing down here in the evening or on a weekend, but for lunches near the office, it will do!"}
{"text":"Sushi is OK. Service is horrible. I've been about 5 or 6 times and every time the service is bad. 

One time our waitress left in the middle of serving us to go get jugo juice for herself and some other staff members. We had to wait until she returned to order, and were late to a meeting because of the 15 minute delay. 

Another time we couldn't figure out why the sushi was taking so long to get, only to look at the sushi bar and notice that the chef was sitting at a table eating his lunch instead of making our sushi. 

It's got to the point where I refuse to go there, even though it's convenient and I actually like the sushi."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with colleague. We both ordered the bento box C, lunch special. It was not bad. I Iiked the sukiyaki beef. The sushi that came with the bento box was so so. It was quite spicy. Their spring rolls are awesome. They tasted like McD Chicken Mcnuggets. mm mmm. Highly recommend getting that. 

Prices are at the higher end for its quality. Its located inside Eau Claire Market. 

Décor is ok. I have noticed that even during lunch time they are not that busy"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, though it tastes somehow saltier than I'm used to. Nice saki on-tap selection, though pricey. Grouping made this a great choice!"}
{"text":"Came in to try the sushi. Location is excellent. Sushi is average. We had a complaint about a menu item and management took the item off our bill. I'm giving 3 stars for service and location of the restaurant. Food is medeocre. Stick to a Sapporo on a sunny day on the patio."}
{"text":"1. Quality of sashimi is not good at all. Some pieces tasted super fishy, some pieces tasted like it's been in the freezer for a year.

2. The waitress totally suck. They are SLOW, need to remind them to bring chopsticks  to eat...? come on.

3. Over priced for what its worth."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the food was really good.  The prices seemed on par with other reputable sushi places in Calgary.  I was here with my mom (thanks for buying!) and son, and when I asked the waiter for an orange juice for him, she said, \"it's on tap, so it isn't very good.\"  Points for honesty, I guess.

It is convenient to get to if you're coming from outside of downtown, and the parking is decent for downtown (but it's Calgary, so it still sucks and costs too much), but it wouldn't be my first choice for sushi."}
