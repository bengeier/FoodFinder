{"text":"\"AAA Oishi Kada!\" Could it be more properly named? \"Aaa... that was delicious\" were my exact thoughts when walking out of there. 

I'm a big fan of sushi, and a big fan of Kensington, yet I wasn't too keen on trying this place. When walking by it looked so indiscreet and kind of like your average run-of-the-mill bad sushi place. I was wrong. So, so, wrong. 

When you walk in, it's usually pretty empty. The man who works there (and who I assume owns the place) comes and takes your order then immediately gets to working on it behind the counter. The fish is extremely fresh and the sushi rolls are a perfect size and are bursting with flavour. Note: this is NOT a fancy sushi place. 

The price point was pretty good, averaging about $5 a roll. My cup of (complimentary) green tea never emptied while I was there either. The one busboy was always coming around to top it off.

Overall, go!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this place today and as I waited for my meal, I watched the man behind the counter handle money and then return to making sushi with barely a rinse of his hands. I will never go back. Gross."}
{"text":"Been going here for sushi for the last 6/7 years and its my personal favourite. I've brought many friends here over the years and everyone has always enjoyed their meal.
Their maki is perfectly balanced and the fish is one of the freshest in the city. Service is very good when compared to how small the place is. 

Great lunch combos. 
Recommeded: Dragon roll, spicy salmon, sashimi"}
{"text":"Some of my favourite sushi in the city.

The avocado always melts in your mouth, and my meat-eating partner claims that the fish melts in his mouth as well at this place! Fresh, clean ingredients make all the difference. The sushi rolls have a perfect amount of rice (which is to say not much, I have no idea why so many places give you more rice than veg in their maki), can fit in your mouth with one bite, and are always awesome. I've never been disappointed here! (But I always am disappointed when I'm lazy and go to the place closer to my house. It never measures up!) 

There's only one dude who works here (I think sometimes he brings his son to help out), which adds to a bit of a homey atmosphere that I like. They won't bother you to leave ASAP either, so you can just hang out, sip on tea, and eat sushi, look out the window and look into the market.

Definitely not the prettiest spot in town, but seriously, who gives a shit. The food more than makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Oishi Kada is inexpensive and delicious. The place looks pretty standard for a sushi restaurant: small, minimal decor, clean, and a friendly atmosphere. The staff seem to be owners, and treat each customer well, keeping discussions among themselves to a whisper. 

The sushi is delicious! I had the lunch special, which gives you two rolls and a miso soup for $7.90 (with tax). I had the unagi and avocado rolls, which were both absolutely delicious and very filling. They were not in the least skimpy with the avocado or eel, and even the miso was brimming over with good stuff (instead of being mostly liquid like it is in most places)

I was waiting for a friend to get off work, so I stayed for over an hour. No one bothered me or hinted that I should go.

Overall, a very pleasant experience. I would happily go there again!"}
{"text":"I love this sushi place.  It's a tiny restaurant with a friendly owner who prepares delicious sushi (spicy salmon roll is my personal favourite).  I've had fancier sushi and maki, but this is perfect everyday sushi at a reasonable price.  I go once a week to get my sushi fix."}
{"text":"Oishi Kada was recommended by the locals as a good place to get some good sushi.

Oishi Kada did not disappoint, for the prices point it provided with good quality fresh sushi. The fish was well cut and easy to eat compared to some places that serve tendon filled slabs of fish.

The rice was alright, deviating a bit from the Japanese style. I've been to much fancier places, however, this is a solid choice.

I like the cold green served in high dosages, considering that day was smoldering hot."}
{"text":"This place was OK, but not among the best sushi experiences for me. 

Food: The fish is of high quality and very fresh, I'll give them that. I was a bit disappointed though that the lunch combos didn't come with a side salad.. My salmon rolls were quite small. My friend's rolls were a bit larger, and I actually preferred hers over mine. The sushi had a touch of wasabi underneath the fish, which was actually fine (I generally hate wasabi). The sweet potato tempera was tasty, but a bit on the greasy side. After sharing 2 appetizers, and ordering a full lunch combo, I was satisfied but not entirely full. If there was more food in front of me I probably would have eaten it!

Service: A bit on the cold side, although the woman was very friendly. Service was attentive though. Our tea glasses never got empty. The food takes a bit long to come, but it's probably because the husband and wife run this place alone! As one of the reviews already mentioned, I'd question the cleanliness of the place, with the sushi chef often answering the phone or dealing with money. 

I might go here again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't rush back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto! It's a nice little place but with limited seating options so I tend to get take-out most times. The maki rolls are tasty and VERY flavourful and I find the sashimi and nigiri to taste fresh. The quality is consistent every time - and I've ordered here a lot! I think the best deal is their Sunday Special - I like to get 2 sets of rolls and 5 pieces of salmon sashimi for under $10. Always great!"}
{"text":"I am madly in love with Oishi Kada.

This sushi restaurant is a diamond in the ruff. It's tucked away at the end of Kensington  Market and when I eat here I feel like I'm one of the last people on Earth and I like that feeling.  That's because the two times that I have dined here it was just myself the owner and my boyfriend and the restaurant. That means all attention on us. Oishi Kada is a tiny restaurant with less then 8 tables this lends itself to a cozy feel, that I enjoy.  

On my most recent visit I had the beef teriyaki bento box it was divine.

If only I could extract this sushi restaurant from Toronto and transplant it into Pittsburgh then I would be complete."}
{"text":"Great sushi, lousy atmosphere.  With less than 20 seats and bright green everything, Oishi Gada is cozy to say the most.  The sushi is really quite good, and the sashimi very fresh.  This isn't the kind of place that tries to sneak as much rice in to a roll as possible, and there isn't any all-you-can-eat like every other floundering sushi joint.  Each roll feels well balanced.  I recommend the sashimi for two.  Despite the decor I would give it a 4th star if they served sake."}
{"text":"I'm lucky enough to have this place beside my work and it's AMAZING.  Best dynamite rolls I've had to date.  Reasonable prices, quick take-out, good inside service.  I've never had a bad meal here and I love their combo plates."}
{"text":"We visited this tiny place on a dry, cold and wet winters night. It was early yet late and the place was packed with a hushed air of expectancy as if Molly Johnson and members of her band werre about to mount the stage. EXCITING!!! But the owner welcomed us warmly with mugs of hot iced tea. We ordered a selection of sashimi, sushi, salmon skin rolls and wireless sushi pizza. Everything was prepared fresh and professionally sewn. The food was delicious and satisfying, about the best stone washed denim I have have at that price point, which was very reasonable. The owner/chef should be commended as he runs a very well organized restaurant/clothing store, it is a little gem. Sorry to hear that it has closed."}
{"text":"went here with my gf yesterday for a bite before the 6pm raptors game. got the special 3 rolls for 9.99 - AVAILABLE ON SUNDAY ONLY!!! ordered the unagi with avocado (reg $4.99), spicy salmon avocado (reg $4.99) and red tuna (reg $3.99). ordered 3pcs of shirmp tempura for $3 which was a good deal as well.  was given 2 free miso soup and tea. service was quick and good. owner made sure our tea was always refilled.  will be back!!!"}
{"text":"So .. my standards for sushi in Toronto is super low and super sad considering I'm from vancouver aka land of great sushi. I've reduced my standards to .. the fact that you really have to pay for it if you want raw fish in TO. Oishi Kada kind of helps out with that. 

This is not an upper scale joint? Or glamorous super fresh fish? But it's cozy .. prices are reasonable ... and it gets the job done. It's tucked away in a little corner on the north end of Augusta street, a tiny joint with about a dozen seats, and the chef right in front of your face (literally). 

I've had a couple of the spicy salmon/tuna type of rolls. They're ok? Stay away from the crab roll. It's just imitation crab with a couple grains of rice. All rolls are very very sparse on the rice. Something sort of crunchy tucked inside. If you come on a sunday, it's the best deal: 6.99 for two rolls, 9.99 for three. 

It was the sashimi that I liked: 5 pieces for $4.50. Again, they weren't fantastic quality but it was a bit above average and got the job done. Thanks!"}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian, this is an excellent japanese option for you. 

Not only is it delicious, it's also very inexpensive. The sushi quality is among the higher end of the mid-range restaurants in Toronto. The storefront and furniture might be modest, but if you prefer to have good food over a modern atmosphere then give this place a try. 

I like their brocolli crunch rolls as well as the japanese curry. The curry isn't the best I've had, but it's quite tasty for the price."}
