{"text":"\"Had the chicken special - Chicken Caprese. Well made, not salty, well cooked and the combination of tomato jam and mozzarella gave it a nice balance of sweetness and savory.\""}
{"text":"This is the best burger truck in the valley. Burgers are so juicy with butter toasted brioche bun and great cheeses. I had the burger with fresh mozzarella & bacon. Outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously - this is THE BEST burger food truck in the valley!! I coordinate \"Food Truck Third Thursdays\" at my office and they've come up twice now. And they are by far the biggest hit! The burgers are juicy and delicious. Everything is so fresh!! And the fries are extra crispy and amazing! Not a bad thing can be said by these guys. And the guy that takes our orders is super friendly! Way to go!!"}
{"text":"You guys suck. Took me AN HOUR to get my food. First you guys lost my order after waiting 25 minutes, then you ran out of bacon magically, then after waiting some more and walking all the way back to my desk I realized the order was wrong, walked back having to wait another 10-15 minutes after being accused of not placing my order correctly and no apology. The girl working your orders, sucks, has a bad attitude and zero customer service. Burger was decent, not worth the 16 bucks and hour I paid for it. Would def not recommend."}
{"text":"You have to try this food truck! The burgers come in delicious creative varieties that will make you wish you had more room left in your stomach! I had the smoky pig with bacon and smoked gouda... dripping with amazing flavor! And the fries... No everyday potato here! A light batter and seasoning make the fries alone worth a search for where he's parked today :) You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Burger Passion is absolutely AMAZING! They come to MASTER Electronics every other week and they are PHENOMENAL every time!

Matt is very professional, flexible and his food is good! He has great prices, the food comes out quick and he's always a hit at MASTER Electronics!

I recommend Burger Passion for ALL bookings of any sort! It is guaranteed to make your event a hit!"}
{"text":"Best food truck burger ever! And their fries are to die for. So crispy! I get their black bean chipotle burger and it is so yummy!"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN the best burger and fries I have ever had! The burgers are soo juicy! The fries are to die for. They are better than In n Out. Yes, I said better than In n Out! You have to try them!  I always look forward to them coming to the Queen Creek Feastival. Can't wait to have it tonight!

 p.s. Please make a restaurant so I can enjoy your burgers any day of the week :)"}
{"text":"$4 for a small handful of fries... nuff said. Had both the beef burgers and veggie burgers which was ok. But not worth what they were charging. Pretty disappointing."}
