{"text":"Just started vegetarian diet a few weeks ago and found it difficult to find a food alternative restaurant to eat at. This place makes amazing food! The service was great! But again the food...!!!!  I am also gluten free and sugar free and they accommodated me 100%.  Looks like I've found a new favorite restaurant! Thanks Jorge!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently dined here and we have found a gem! First if all, I will confess to being non-vegetarian, let alone vegan, and I found the dishes here very delicious, with good fresh ingredients and full of flavor. The atmosphere is simple and clean, yet warm and comfortable. I must say the veggie? burger was the best I have ever eaten.the owner came over to check on our enjoyment and to ask if we had any suggestions. More cochinas was the only one I could think of. The combination of fresh, new dishes, generous portions, moderate prices and delicious tastes makes this a \"must try\" for vegans, vegetarians and omnivores alike."}
{"text":"WOW! One of the best tasting burgers I have ever eaten! I have it a try and it won me over.  Nothing was lost on flavor!"}
{"text":"Great location and I am so happy they opened a restaurant/fast food location on Fort Apache! Right across the street from Walmart. I had the vegan chicken wrap and it was delicious. Everything I had came out nice and fresh. I absolutely loved the atmosphere. It was very cool calm and inviting!! If you are on the southwest side check this place out it is definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"So far I've tried the falafel cheese burger, the veggie cheese burger, fries, protein truffles & an iced coffee. Everything was perfect with the exception of the protein truffles, those were just ok. They use Beyond Meat for their burgers (which is soooooo good), I think even meat eaters could enjoy. Quick service and easy to find location. Excited to try more about items off the menu"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place! Great service, super friendly. \"Co-sheen-ya\" is incredible (based on Lee's awesome recommendation tried the 'beef,' def coming back for the chicken option too) and the Crazy Falafel. Yum yum yum yum. Everything is awesome. Good vibe, good music, good food, good humans. Love it here and will be an affordable go-to stop! (Thanks Lee, it was awesome!)"}
{"text":"New favorite vegan spot! Super cute clean open airy spot. Love the menu, good prices, really yummy food. I ate here 2x in 1 day. 
I tried the crazy falafel, lentil soup, yucca fries, quinoa salad, falafel bites.

If I can give a suggestion. Maybe more grilled non-fried items. But maybe that's my fault for ordering all the fried foods. I will for sure be coming back!!
I have a really good feeling about this place!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. I had the crazy falafel and zombie drink with pineapple fusion. It was great. It's so good to have a vegan eatery in the neighborhood.  Restaurant is clean staff is very nice."}
{"text":"This was BY FAR the most delicious vegan fast food I have ever had. I got the cheeseburger and fries with a acai lemonade and protein ball. I think that cheeseburger rivaled burgers of the non vegan variety. It was so good. 

The location is convenient, right off of Fort Apache and near lots of other shopping.

The decor is fun and they have charging stations which is really great for people like me who live on there phones. 

They had these adjustable tables which some might like but I kept accidentally hitting the button and they would rise and lower. I had to unplug the table. 

Right now they open at 11am for lunch, I how they add breakfast to the menu soon."}
{"text":"Ordered Crazy Falafel, Falafel burger meal with fries and coffee. They asked if we are vegan during the order and we made sure of it! I have cancer and I REALLY don't want ANY dairy in my food to increase the size of my tumors. The food tastes great and service with a smile. The server made us feel very welcoming. I took some pics of the Crazy falafel but my husband finished his burger before I got a chance to take any photos...

CONS: 100% plant-based is not exactly true if they serve vegetarian food. Because Plant-based REALLY means all food made with plants. Study now shows dairy foods raises the chances of people getting cancer - info from documentary \"Forks Over Knifes\" So I think either this restaurant should remove the 100% plant-based business description or stop serving dairy. I would prefer they stop serving dairy. I only eat at places that ONLY served all vegan food. So if this place continue to served dairy, honesty, we will not return."}
{"text":"Hands down they have the best cheeseburgers in town. I mean for this to be a vegan place I'm just impressed how amazing the food is. I try different things but I'm hooked on the cheeseburger."}
{"text":"This is right down the street from where I live so I go here often. The food is always fresh and the people are so nice. I like to get the veggy burger, you cant tell the difference between it and a meat burger. Its so good I tricked my boyfriend into eating it."}
{"text":"I'll give it 5 Stars bc what we had was really good and I'll def be going back.  The vegan burger was delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food, incredible service. I love everyone who works here and kind of come just to see them sometimes.  Veggy Street is a simple, delicious spot for a quick vegan bite. Def recommend"}
{"text":"That tapioca bread! 

Now that this place has its S together and are not confused what plant based means...literally on their signage...I gave them another chance.
Yes this place is now all vegan. 

Not a fan of faux foods but I wanted to really try this tapioca creation and VERY glad I did. Beef over chicken because anything that smells remotely like chicken (fowl smell) makes me gag, didn't risk it.

My choice was the Beef Tapioca thingy. I chose the meal but it was way too much food for me. 
Also, don't make the mistake I made and try to eat this in your car. The person who placed it in the bag had it sideways so when I opened the foil...quinoa alllll over the universe. No worries, car needs detailed.

If you try and eat it in the car lol. It's messy but soooooooooooo yummy! I was pleasantly surprised. The bread is the start of the show.

People who know me, I can't stand bread. Bread tastes gross, texture is gross and my body just doesn't care for it. This bread thingy is AMAZING!!!!!!! If I could buy a dozen and make my own wraps and stuff I would! 

Another side note, I usually eat oil free. This is not. It's not super oily, but you can tell they sautéed the onions in oil. A little gooey oil action going on. 
The faux beef is scarce and possibly made of TPV? not sure. It was flavorful and just the right amount, very little. 

I haven't tried the quinoa salad. I'm too full. Also if you know me (example: AYCE veggie sushi) I can eat A LOT. So me being full off this tapioca pita is a miracle.

I would like to try their açaí? bowl but I don't like sweets, yes again, I'm a weirdo. 

So second chances are awesome and I'm glad I gave VeggyStreet one!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just tried their new street tacos made with Tacopiica Vegan Beef! Yum My friend had the Veggy Eleven-She loved it! The staff is always right on point and the owner Jorge is always around to make sure everything taste great and give us some samples of new items they're trying. If you want a good plant-based meal at a good price come check this place out I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I was really looking forward to trying this place. Staff was cordial, at best. Definitely not friendly or welcoming. I ordered a toasted caprese to go. When I unwrapped it the first thing that hit me was all I could smell was a burnt odor. Sure enough, one side of the bun was burnt and hard as a rock. Inside the sandwich was a spattering of cheese, a single thin slice of tomato and a bunch of mixed greens. The bun was seasoned with dried basil and olive oil. No visual evidence or taste of balsamic. I will give them another shot, because I try not to judge based on just one experience (everyone has a bad day). But if you're going to charge $7.50 for a caprese sandwich, it should at least have a decent amount of tomato and cheese, fresh basil, and some detectable balsamic. This was more like hard burnt bread with oil and mixed greens. What I got was a $3 sandwich - not a $7.50 sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been keeping an eye on Veggy Street via social media ever since their signage went up over the summer. When they opened in September, there was a lot of confusion about whether their food was actually vegan as advertised. It wasn't until December that the restaurant actually confirmed that they were vegan. Not sure what the story is there but the situation kept me away until their Veganuary promotion.  

Clean location, fairly expansive menu. Opted for the vegan burger (made with Beyond Meat products), added vegan cheese (Daiya?), as a combo with fries and a house-made hibiscus tea for $8, which was a great discount from their usual prices ($15?)*. The burger itself was solid and had a passably \"meaty\" mouthfeel and a pink hue favorably compares to some of the dry, grain-based patties I've had elsewhere. It could benefit from some sort of house sauce, too. I do wish they made their own product in house rather than just serving up a frozen and reheated patty- it's why I refuse to patronize businesses that zap a Boca Burger and call themselves a vegan dining destination. I am interested in coming back to try other items, though.

*Speaking of pricing, it's a bit high for the quality of product, even given that they're a niche market. Burgers are regularly ~$10 and it's +$4 to make your order a combo with a side and drink (bottled water and fries?), which is ludicrous. 

I am happy to have more healthy and vegetarian, vegan, etc dining options available, and I do look forward to coming back here, but there are a few things I think they should work on."}
{"text":"I have been blessed to eat at Veggie Street and I am so GRATEFUL for the healing food that Chef/Owner George has served and pre-pared for me especially.. This is my 3rd visit in one week and I have tried something different each time and been blessed with al wonderful surprises, thank you VEGGIE STRET and George..

I anticipate my next visits

{"text":"Very impressed! They have the Beyond The Meat Burger!!!! Strictly the best!!! Super happy and will be going back SOON!"}
{"text":"A little piece of Brazil with me, today!
Great costumer service, very fast, and just walk-in inside is like walking on the streets in Rio.
Great job guys, the best success for you!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick, light lunch and got just that. We both got the Veggy Eleven (Veggie cheeseburger with fries) and a Cucumber H20 blast. 

The drink was sweet but not too sweet. I like that the didn't overcompensate with sugar. There were mint leaves in it too so that added some extra freshness. 

The burger could legitimately pass as a beef burger. It was even pink on the inside! Served on a pretzel bun with \"cheese\", this is something worth returning for on its own. 

The only thing I have to take a star away for is the service. The cashier/waitress was very nice, but hit me twice with some slight small-business-greed that I didn't appreciate at all. I'm pretty easygoing especially when it comes to small neighborhood business and try not to be too picky but sometimes I can't help it. The French fries the burger comes with are greasy and don't settle well in my stomach. As soon as we completed the order and I finished paying, I pleaded with the employee to trade my fries with a small bed of lettuce and she advised she would need to ring me up for a salad. Not ok. Then she brought us the food, we asked for a side of mayo. After going to the back to ask, she came back to let us know she would have to charge us .54c. 

.54c. For some mayo. 

Either they aren't doing well and need every speck of ingredients to be accounted for, or they're just plain greedy. We came out of our way and paid, tipped well, we're polite...the whole 9. The salad I can excuse but not a side of mayo. That's not the customer service experience your patrons deserve while they pay more for food at your establishment than they would anywhere else in at least a mile radius. 

But don't get me wrong, I'll rant about some mayo all day because it's the principle of the matter, but the food is bomb!!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good! The Veggy burger is like real meat, but better it's crazy. The \"no way Jose\" shake it super bomb too. The place itself is adorable and staff is nice. My mother is from Brazil, and coxinha is something she had me eat growing up, it's DELICIOUS and can't wait to try a vegan version!!! And the protein balls, are like little vegan brigadeiros. In love. I am hooked!"}
{"text":"In no way I am a vegetarian or vegan (I love my kbbq too much) but I really like trying new stuff for a change. Last time I tried a vegetarian/vegan burger was at Panacea in Boca Park and it was terrible. In their burgers , their patty is mostly just mashed up beans and you can see the corn , quinoa , etc. all that stuff in every bite. At Veggy Street even though they don't make their own vegan patties (they use Beyond Meat products you can find at like Whole Foods) either way , it's fine to me since those patties are pretty bomb. It actually tastes like meat and texture is good. I usually order their \"Veggy Eleven\" which is their vegan cheeseburger and comes w/ side of fries. I actually prefer their regular fries over their parmesan yucca fries since it compliments the taste of their burger more. Pretzel bun is great too instead of the usual type of bun so I hope that never changes. They have so many different options for lunch/dinner but I always end up craving their vegan cheeseburger on that pretzel bun whenever I come here."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it's amazing! I get the veggie burger and you can't even tell it's fake meat! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good, hearty and fulfilling vegan experience you must visit VeggyStreet. Just got off the place (literally) and we don't have many vegan options back home. I was delighted to know the food met all of my expectations. My son may have stolen my fries but VeggyStreet has stolen my belly heart! Keep it up guys you are amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I wish they had more on the menus as in pastas and entrees.  The veggie cheeseburger is made with all fresh ingredients.  The pretzel bun is so good.  I also ordered a lemon açaí soda drink that was addicting. I drove past this place all the time and finally tried it last night.  Love it!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the lentil soup and a salad. Reasonable prices and tasty. The dessert was okay but nothing to really rave about. We tried the tapioca with nutella and the protein balls"}
{"text":"Ive been coming back at least 4 times a month! Love the number 11 burger & yucca fries are the best!"}
{"text":"The vegan chicken wrap is delicious! It was the most flavorful vegan thing I've eaten all year. I cannot wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"First time in Las Vegas. My girlfriend is a vegetarian, I am not. I'm willing to try everything at least once. Glad that we stopped here. The cashier was extremely friendly and showed us the full menu. She even made a few solid recommendations. The cheeseburger was amazing as was the falafel. I will definitely eat here again if I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Their veggie burger is the best thing in the world. Great food, great price and super fast."}
{"text":"High quality vegan and vegetarian food. Food is made fresh and the service is extremely friendly. I felt very welcome here. I highly recommend the Chicken Tacopioca it is a very interesting dish with a lot of flavor. Lots of options here. Great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want a bomb burger, delicious hot dog and fries!!! All vegan too! I've tried other things on the menu but these are what we come back for! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Pretty solid vegan joint. Have a lot of small fast food type items (wraps, burritos, fries, etc). The juices are amazing! I like the use of the tapioca and lavash wraps!"}
{"text":"A friend told me the other day about this place and I just happened to be driving by today and I was starving!!!! I am SO SO glad I stopped in! Inside, is a really cool feeling room, black and white checkers and teal green, which I love! They have a lot of plants which I love even more!!! They also have tables that raise and lower and have USB ports to charge your phone or tablet! So cool! 
So even better then the ambiance was the food. I am not a big fan of the fake meat stuff, but I wanted to try something new. I choose the Smart Dog. It was fantastic! It was in a pretzel bun and topped with red onion, cilantro, peas, parm, and some sort of roasted tomato basil sauce. Now, individually I like all those things and the pic looked good, so in spite of the very odd combo, I went for it. And so glad I did! It was amazing!!!! I added fries and a soda. Wow. What a surprisingly great lunch! I have not been a vegan for that long but I am so happy that I chose to take this journey in a time and a city that really makes it easy! Thank you VS for bringing this to my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ok. I don't particularly seek out vegan food. Ever. But I was starving one day and stumbled inside and I've literally come back a dozen times since. I'm practically a vegan now. Not really but I'm just going to say this: I tricked my kids into a cheeseburger from this place and they had ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA it was vegan. They ate the entire thing. And these kids are crafty. They are the type of kids that can taste one eighth of a tiny piece of an onion in spaghetti. I actually had to double check the 'burger' a number of times because not only did it look like a real burger but it actually tasted like one. Not like those nasty veggie burgers with the grains and rocks and quinoa. It was amazing. I usually get the crazy falafel because I love all the veggies in it and their sauce. This is a must try place, even if you're nowhere near vegan."}
{"text":"FIRE!!!!! You could literally now have your cake and eat it too!! Vegan has come a long way. 
#noanimalprotein"}
{"text":"The last time I had vegan or veggie food I felt pretty disappointed and deep fried all my twinkies and hostess cupcakes the next morning to make up for it.

Luckily that wasn't the case at all at veggy street, I honestly was completely fooled by their vegan burger!

I had tried the vegan and veggy burger with a side of their parmesan yucca fries. Both have the vegan burger patty with the only difference being the buns and vegan cheese on the vegan burger. In all honesty, I couldn't tell the difference in the cheese. So if you're looking for a full on healthier option you might as well go all in and get the vegan.

The patty was very juicy and flavorful not needing any extra sauce or ketchup, unless you really prefer to.

The parmesan yucca fries are a little dry but not too bad at all. Preferably I think I would of liked it cut into thinner slices instead of wedges but either way it still had a nice crisp to it. It does make for a decent alternative to a pile of deep fried potatoes if you're looking to watch your cholesterol level.

Staff are also very polite and welcoming informing us of their menu options, description, and suggestions.

I would definitely come back for their vegan burger again, it'll certainly make me feel a lot less guilty after a good gym day."}
{"text":"Sooo good ! Max was awesome and very informative about food and so welcoming also this pretty lady brought me a protein truffle and was so nice ! Def the best vegan meal I've had so far in Vegas ! Thanks ;) and my best friend loved it"}
{"text":"Self proclaimed Plant Based fast food. Design is hipster bohemian, pretty clean and organized. Table tops are adjustable heights and have the capacity to charge phones which is convenient. Menu is comprised of bowls, sandwiches, fries etc. limited juices and primarily smoothies. Tried the zombie & venom smoothies, both were on the sweet side for my taste. Falafel burger was well put together, a little salty but for $8 and change it's a nice bite for sure. I'll be back to try the other items. Service was good for the concept."}
{"text":"OMG!!
I was looking for a vegan treat! I stopped by this place and was recommended the vegan cheeseburger. This was an amazing burger and i will be back for more. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The store was clean and easy to find. 
They also have menus you can take with you. I will introduce my family to vegan food at this place because the burger was so good."}
{"text":"I had vegan food for the first time and it was amazing. I got a vegan cheeseburger and it tasted like a regular burger. I would absolutely come back here and eat more vegan food. It was definitely affordable and I would bring more people here!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! We had the Veggy burgers with the Yucca fries...2 days in a row! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I had been coming here for a year and now that I live far away,  I pray they open up more locations in town because they are my absolute favorite plant based restaurant in town!  Their burgers and juices/infused water drinks are my favorite and it's really hard to choose anything else! Keep it up guys and take over the town!  Customer for life!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great for a quick, affordable vegan meal. The staff is very friendly.  I recommend the Venom smoothie and Yuca fries. All of the sandwiches are delicious so you can't go wrong, I always get the Street Sandwich.  I hope they have much success!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Amazing food. My family is vegetarian and we passed by this place. Made a U turn and decided to give it a try. We ordered the signature cheeseburger, falafrl cheese sandwich, veggie dog, and yucca fries. My two kids were in love!!  Being a non veg myself, I must admit that Veggy street has figured out how to really make a veggie burger stand out amongst any other that I have had in several years. Nice and tender patty nowhere clise to cardboard like veggie burgers. The falafel was perfect. Some of the top notch yucca fries I have had in a while. In my opinion, Veggy Street would be Vegetarian's delight and non veg folks will enjoy as well!!  Customer service was upbeat and fantastic."}
{"text":"I've never had a veggy burger, but this was so close to the real thing that I'll be back for sure! Fries are crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"By far the best vegan burger I have ever tried and it's definitely my place for vegan fast food. Great and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to try this place out! 
The atmosphere inside the restaurant is so relaxed and VERY clean. I ordered the cheese burger and I was impressed. The buns were pretzel so it was soft and delicious. Honestly you wouldn't be able to tell if this was meatless or not. The burger itself was $8.95 and you can add a side of fries for $4 which came out to be $12 

A bit pricey but I would imagine with all the ingredients it adds up. The food to go was placed in a white bag. Sophisticated and chic! It's a bit far from where I'm located but if I'm on that side of town I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"So I came to this place because as much as I love eating I need to also improve my diet. First I just wanted to say the smell of the food in my car was beyond amazing! My boyfriend enjoyed a cheese veggie burger and said that it tasted better than most Veggies burgers he has had in the past and I enjoyed my pressed \"chicken\" sandwich which had a spicy kick to it but the good kind of spicy kick. But what the falafel!!!!The one item I wanted the most was burnt/over cooked. The falafels were extremely hard and impossible to chew. I wish I would have checked prior to leaving the facility because I probably would have requested new ones. I know they would have been good because the little bit on the inside that wasn't burnt had really good flavor. This was really disappointing and I can't say I wouldn't recommend going because everything else was fine I would just recommend checking your food before making it all the way home. Rookie mistake."}
{"text":"As an avid lover of all things that bleed, I walked in here, skeptical, wondering if it was possible to recreate a burger with nothing but vegan love inside. Survey says--it is! This hip eatery serves some mean vegan burgers, killer sides, and the tastiest water concoctions.  I highly recommend trying a bit of everything.  The veggie patty looked like meat, which I thought was pretty cool.  The buns are fluffy and tasty, and the fries were delish.  I was satisfied and full from this place."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! I frequently call ahead for pickup on my way home from work and the food is CONSISTENTLY DELICIOUS! I highly recommend the Veggy Eleven, it's a guilt free delight! Veggy Street has a super cool vibe, staff is always helpful with recommendations. I highly highly recommend stopping in. Vegan or not you will not be sorry!!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for new places to bring my carnivore friends and this is my new go to. Really fun menu, great food, friendly staff. Big plus was the music being played, if I can listen to old fall out boy and enjoy my vegan lunch, I'm happy."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! First time here and will definitely be back ordered the. Veggie 11 burger, amazing!! :)))) free truffle for checking in!"}
{"text":"Best vegan burger. The menu is a bit confusing though there is a vegetarian and vegan side. So when I order something new I have to make sure it's VEGAN with no meat products."}
{"text":"This is the best veggie burger I have ever eaten.  In the past I ate the veggie burger at Red Robin.   Veggy Street has blown them out of the water.  I am looking forward to my next burger."}
{"text":"First time trying a veggie burger, and for a moment while I was eating it, I couldn't even tell that it was veggie patty. You had me fooled lol. It was super juicy, and I could taste the freshness of every ingredient with each bite. The pretzel bun was also perfectly toasted. Been awhile since I enjoyed a burger like that! Got a side of their parmesan Yucca fries to go along with the burger, and it was bomb! Nice and crisp on the outside. It tasted like these Korean onion ring chips I used to eat when I was young. 

I also got their infused water drinks with cucumber, and it was so refreshing! They put guarana in it, which is a plant imported from Brazil, and it's supposed to keep you super wired due to its high caffeine content. 

I don't think I'll ever become a vegan tbh (I love my meats), but eating this food was a nice change of pace. Will definitely be back to try some of their other items!"}
{"text":"My bff just picked up some food from here and brought it over. I got the Veggy cheeseburger and OMG soooo bomb!!!!  Mouthwatering. Even the patty was delicious and at first thought it was meat. Definitely excited to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Just wow!!! 
Everything was absolutely perfect here
The service = fantastic 
The food = fantastic 
The cleanliness = fantastic 
I wish it wasn't as pricey but hopefully more people can support these vegan spots so that prices lower in the future 
Loved it .. will def be back anytime I'm in Vegas 
Ps. Husband who is very picky was just as happy as me with the food"}
{"text":"I own a shop in the same complex and this place caught my eye. I'm definitely a carnivore, but I like to explore healthy options. The staff/owner is friendly and helpful- they asked if I preferred vegan or vegetarian and since I have no preference or allergies, I figure I'll work my way through a few menu items. The food is tasty, and I was perfectly happy with my order of falafel bites and a chicken wrap. I've honestly never had vegan chicken before- so I don't know what to compare it to, but the texture and taste were pretty great. I will be coming back- and I'll mention it to my customers as well."}
{"text":"The first time I tried Veggy Street I was a little disappointed, I unknowingly got a weird sandwich that was stuffed with mushrooms (i hate mushrooms) and it was $9 for the sandwich alone. Despite not liking the shroomy sandwich, I sensed potential for it to be good if I got something else, so I went back. The second time I went there was a promotion going on where an entire meal was about $11, this time I got the regular vegan burger and it was amazing. I think if the food was always at this price range, I would definitely frequent this place a lot. I really love the decor and I'm happy to support local vegan restaurants, so long as they don't hurt my wallet so much. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because of the price."}
{"text":"Sorry the burgers looked like real meat. Took two bites but I was grossed out at the color of the imitation, red color remind me of raw meat. Fries are alright, to thin for my like. Restaurant looks clean and inviting. Friendly staff.."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the portions are tiny and it's very expensive for what you get. 
Also the cashier today was not friendly at all. I'd eat here again if it were free"}
{"text":"as non vegan person, they do food that makes you appreciate veggie food. nice done.

as group of four people, good feedback for toasted caprese, veggie burger, chicken tapocopia, and special kudos to the fallafel and co-sheen-ya (as sides) which makes you feel like you missed on a potential special main dish."}
{"text":"To all my American bar-burger lovers, this was the first place with a burger that was absolutely satisfying! My girlfriend brought me here for my first Vegas trip on Monday (6/11), and by the time I left (6/16) we had gone there 3 times.

The zalafel bites were meh, get the regular French fries if you're going that route... I cannot stress the burger enough. I did get two patties the second time in for an extra $5. It's a little messy but if you put the extra party on the bottom (yes, underneath the pretzel bun), you'll thank me. 

Happy eating friends"}
{"text":"A new favorite!!! The food is so delicious! We had the falafel cheeseburger, the beyond burger cheeseburger, fries, hot dogs, and protein balls. Absolutely loved everything!

The service was great! The young man at the counter was super nice, helping us decide what to get for our 1st time here. He knew exactly how to accommodate our children (2.5 & 5yo) by splitting their fries and their protein ball in half before serving them. 

I also really liked the ambiance. Clean, modern, cool and trendy.

We will definitely be back! Often!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! I can't even stress this enough. I am NOT in any way vegan or vegetarian! But I wanted to try something else for a change. I wanted to experience food outside of my comfort zone.

I ordered two burgers, one for myself and one for my boyfriend.

I got him the Veggy cheeseburger and the falafel cheeseburger for myself.

Both were very appetizing, but I am MORE IN LOVE WITH THE VEGGY CHEESEBURGER (Vegan btw)!

It is so flavorful and delicious for being meatless! It reached beyond my expectations. So mouthwatering and scrumptious!

I live around the corner from Veggy Street and typically eat out at Thai Style Noodle House 3-4 tines a week but I feel now, I have another option I can actually enjoy.

I definitely recommend this eatery. It made me contemplate turning vegan for a second. LOL I mean, it has definitely opened my eyes to the variety of good, nutritional alternatives. Plus, I do feel better knowing I can opt for a healthier meal all around.

I can't wait to explore more of their menu and indulge in it!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Veggie burger I've EVER tried.  Very similar to a meaty texture! Omg soooo good! The fries were amazing as well! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from Veggie Street many times and always order the veggie burger combo with the açaí lemonade and have never been disappointed. Their burgers are delicious and are barely distinguishable from the real thing! They have a multitude of side options, but i just prefer their French fries. You MUST try this place!!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Veggy Street, slightly disappointed in the customer service, or the lack there of. There was no warm welcome, and when I said this was my first time here there was no \"Thank you for giving us a try and let me explain our menu to you..\" When I proceeded to order I didn't know I could get any sides or even make it a combo until after re-examining the menu when I was waiting for my food. It would of been nice for the suggestion of \"would you like to add any sides or make it a combo for $x.xx more? I ordered a vegan chicken sandwich and it was pretty good, just truly disappointed in my first experience here. 

Based on my first experience, I will give them 3 stars. If I give them another try I will update my review."}
{"text":"Great good ! I am not a Vegan but went here with a friend , service was great , and nice atmosphere... the Lemonade with Agave was delicious and ordered a Falafel cheeseburger and fries , it was very good , especially the pretzel bun. It's nice to know you can eat healthy and plant based but it also tastes good ! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very surprised to find this in Vegas. Friendly staff that we're cheerful. Cheeseburgers we're fantastic and desserts were different and original. Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!!! So far we have enjoyed the burgers, falafels, sandwiches & fries, and protein balls. Every meal was on point!  The hipster dining area is a miss though. Over the past few months the business has been great there. I think they need more staff. On this visit 6-1-18 , the tables were not wiped down and all of the plants were dying."}
{"text":"SOOOO thankful to yelp today!!! Wow is this burger taste like real meat!! I literally had to put it down because it tastes so much like beef! I thought I may have been in the wrong place! Ha!!!! Great flavors! 

First let me explain that I am 5 months vegan and not wavering !! At all! Whoop whoop! There are some times that a girl just wants a cheese burger and fries ... ya know!! So finding this place, reading the reviews and meeting the ROCKING staff.... love this place! Eli helped me with every question and every concern! Nice job!! 

When you first walk in... not that big of a deal, but.... wait! Menu is small and to the point. No frills and crazy mix of this and that. Simple and clear, clean food! Love that! Cool upbeat music playing .. and amazing humans just eating good food and having a relaxing meal! 

A ton of to go orders... people calling the staff by name and the staff calling customers by name..... that's the way I like it! 

I will be back at least once a month !! Loved this place

2 months later!! Still killin it guys!!! Wha whoooo!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: (12-12-17) Veggy Street is now 100% VEGAN!!

Veggy street is having their grand opening today. The staff has been so helpful and informative. They are still getting in the groove of things. The menu has a great range of options from burgers to salads, desserts and more! I ordered the chicken wrap and the atomic bowl. This totaled at $16.20. $17.54 with tax. $21.05 with tip.  They don't use honey on the atomic bowl but, they do use honey in this facility, as well as dairy products and the bun on the veggie burger is not vegan. SO, make sure to specify if you are vegan or have restrictions. 

The service is not \"fast\" like fast food. As an employee explained they are a healthy balance of gourmet and fast food. They make everything to order, and it's well worth the wait. 

The food is so reasonably priced! Salads coming in at $5-6 and burgers and Sandwiches around $9. I am so excited to have this location so close to my work. This will be a go to place for me.

Also, the most important part... the food was delicious. The chicken wrap was so good and the faux meat they used was incredible! The atomic bowl was very flavorful and filling."}
{"text":"Amazing every single time I go in. Today I had the best burger that I have ever had. They use quality products that make a difference in the overall flavor profile of each item. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!!
I had the eleven eleven which is a vegan cheeseburger and fries! I like mayo with my fries and was so happy they had veganaisse. The \"burger\" was cooked to perfection if it were meat, it would've been a perfect medium. The place is very clean! The gentleman who took my order was super friendly.
I noticed that all of the tables had charging ports in them. I wish other restaurants would take a tip from this place! 
Although I don't live in NV, I come out here every 5 weeks for work and will make sure to always stop in here for dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm going to first start by saying I am not vegan or vegetarian, but I did really want to try this place because I was craving something similar to a burger. I have tried the vegan burger at Vege-Way off of Jones Avenue so I definitely compared the two. 
I'm give this place a 4 solely because I have been on different occasions were the portion sizes differ. The first time I came, the chicken sandwich had very little substance and the second time it was better and had more filling to it. I also wish this place was more affordable since it's pretty pricey overall. 
Both the chicken and the classic vegan burger here are delicious. They honestly taste close to the real thing. I'm always treated with great customer service. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went in after hearing that they had made changes to clearly mark vegan items. I looked at the menu & noticed the vegetarian burger was 8.99 but the vegan burger was 11 something. When asked why that was there was no clear explanation. I bought my daughter the mini vegan burger, I got the vegan burger, 2 sides of fries & a smoothie. They were out of ketchup which annoyed me because they're a burger/ fry place & my total order was just shy of $35. Service was mediocre & the only thing I liked was the pretzel bun- the burger my daughter described as tasting like 'mushed up worms' which I agreed. I wont be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vegan spot. The staff is friendly and are knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients. The cheeseburger and chicken wrap are my favorites. Most of the combos come with fries. Very clean and cute location. I highly recommend for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their lunch special which was a Veggy bowl with vegan sausage and caramelised squash with collard greens! It was fantastic! Not overly salty or over cooked! Lots of flavor! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The veggie burger with cheese was so delicious! I wish I lived closer! We tried a variety of stuff and that was the best so far. The sides were good too. The \"beef\" and \"chicken\" textures were really good!"}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place for a while now! And I was not disappointed at all. 

Dominique was working  at the cash register and right away she asked if we had been there before. 
I told here no and she was quick to explain and recommended the veggy cheese burger (and oh my!!) it was so yummy!

I also ordered 2 orders of street tacos which I thought It was just 1 taco but was surprised when 2 plates were brought out with 3 tacos on each plate! For 5.50$ 3 of these tacos are pretty filling.. the shells were made out of tapioca dough, that was something different and tasty.

The crazy falafel and the co-sheen-ya chicken and beef were also super yummy! All the the food was so good I couldn't even tell you what my favorite would be.
The cucumber water made with crushed cucumber, fresh mint, lime, guarana,acai lychee jelly and b12 was refreshing.

The inside of Veggy Street is modern and clean. This place was so cool the chairs had built in charging ports and the tables charging ports and touch screen tops to adjust the height of your table to your liking! I was like a little kid in amazement lol I don't know if that's a thing now but I had never seen anything like it! 
And for as nice as this place was and the quality and portions of the food it was really affordable! All that food and 2 drinks came up to 40$ wow is all I can say.

I wish I lived closer but I will be making the trip across town to come here again!!"}
{"text":"Crazy Falafel wrap was fresh and pretty good but could use another piece of Falafel in it (very stingy with servings for the price). Lentil soup was just okay because it really needed minerals like sea salt & citric, but they don't have basic things like lemon wedges in their restaurant; luckily I always have sea salt in my handbag and that saved the soup from being completely bland. The 11-burger was meh, patty falls short compared to veggie way (cheaper and better flavor & texture) or Panacea (gourmet in-house made); nice flavor though. Nothing too spectacular, everything from cheeses to patties are pretty much outsourced yet they charge Panacea's gourmet prices (hello??? To the delusional owners), but would eat here again every once in a while just to support vegetarian/vegan businesses in Vegas. Would have given 4-stars for focusing on vegetarian food but had to deduct an extra point because the whole place smelled like acetone, paint, and floor cleaner. To the owner/management: plz keep your art projects and or potting of plants outdoors, the smell really ruins the dine-in experience, so does the horrible horrible girly high school alternative music you guys play--whatever your personal music preferences are, a business should never play an artist's entire album but hire a professional music/playlist service--it was pure torture eating while listening to YOUR music of choice. Another thing to consider, sweet red apples in water don't go with food at all, might want to stick with Granny Smith apples, or keep it simple with cucumber or lemon. You don't want to be a veggie spot that can't get something as basic as house-made fruit defused water right, eh?"}
{"text":"Veggy Street is great!! My boyfriend and I went for lunch and got the Chicken Pressed Sandwich which was sub par we would rate it a 5/10. The Falafel Cheeseburger WAS FREAKING AMAZING!!!!! 10/10 best thing on the menu. The pretzel bun was delectable, the cheese was phenomenal, and the falafel patty was soo flavorful! 
Pro tip: Never ever order any acai bowl or smoothie we ordered the Atomic Bowl and the Mystery Couple. They were both icey and just a disappointment. The Parmesan Yucca Fries were pretty good but sort of a small portion. Overall this vegan place is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Happened to be on this part of town and saw this restaurant that said they serve vegan dishes. First off the staff was very rude, I have never been here and had a few questions about how the food was prepared and if there was for sure no dairy being used.

I got contradictory answers and an attitude from the girl behind the counter. I asked to speak to the owner or chef and they just walked away. After hearing another couple complain of something similar, I decided to walk out and didn't take a chance ordering any food. 

Since I didn't try anything I can't speak to what the food tastes like but if my initial experience is any indication, I would not risk it."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Let me say coming from NYC and moving to Vegas I am grateful for such a delicious veggy vegan friendly eatery on the west side. The owner George is a friendly man who goes out of his way to make my experiences the most enjoyable. I'm inspired by his passion about healthy food and love to hear the stories about how and where his products are being sourced. I am in love with the standard veggy burger as it has a  similar texture to a regular burger which makes it an exciting option for curious carnivores willing to explore veggy options. The special sauce on it is fantastic I always get a side for my fries or extra for the burger. I also tried the \"chicken\" tapioca and enjoyed that as well. George explained the process of how he makes the wrap and is experimenting with a spinach based version of this wrap which I can't wait to try. Although I'm moving to the east side soon I will make sure to make a trip out to Veggy Street whenever I can, because, it's the good! Highly Recommender by a snobby spoiled NYC Native should be enough to give it try!

{"text":"I've been here a couple times and the food is good and people that work here are really nice.  I'm taking two stars away because 1. They've messed up our order twice, with simple requests like no onion or tomato. 2. Their take home menu only has prices/options for the vegetarian stuff. And for some reason The vegan burger is an extra  $2 even though it has less ingredients. The online price of the vegan burger is 10.75, yet we were charged 11.75. I really wanted to love this place since my whole fam is vegan and its located 2 minutes from us but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Had the veggie burger and fries. It was exceptionally good. Can't believe it wasn't \"meat\". Hands down the best veggie burger in vegas, sorry \"Holsteins\". Definitely coming back to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you're reading this you're clearly looking for vegan food on yelp. Just stop and go here. Everything is vegan, there's a huge variety and it's insanely delicious. We had the cheese burger, chickn pressed sandwich, sides of falafel bites and co sheen ya plus the açaí lemonade. It was all super fresh and so good. And we found out they do a special Brazilian (I think) plate only on Saturday so we'll be coming back here asap."}
{"text":"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ON HERE: This place is absolutely delicious and owner is extremely helpful and kind. 
Some items are vegetarian not vegan, yes, HOWEVER there are literally TWO SEPARATE MENUS.. one is completely vegan, and one has some non-vegan ingredients. Staff is very helpful in helping choose what to order if you are full vegan or have dietary restrictions.
I ordered the street hoagie with spicy hummus and it was so good I didn't get a chance to take a picture! It's a shame too because the presentation was beautiful...
If you're a vegan, you really need to give this place a try and please don't deter due to the negative reviews on here. 
We need to support the small businesses here in Vegas who take the time and money to invest  in great vegan restaurants like these, NOT bash them on Yelp before they are even fully open.

Definitely eating here again, and again."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!!! My Veggy Cheeseburger was mouth watering good. I was craving a burger but didn't really want one, and I am so happy I came to Veggy Street!!!!!!! Well Done Veggy Street!!!!!!!!

Yum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

*Employees*
Thanks Max for the amazing customer service. He was super helpful and offered amazing menu suggestions. He told me that the Veggy cheeseburger is one of the best items on the menu. I must say I was very pleased with my Veggy cheeseburger and fries. 

I will definitely be returning for more delicious food!!!!! 

*Inside* 
The inside is super clean with cute decor and their logo on the wall. Check out was super quick and easy. There is a giant menu up front but more detailed menus are available as well. 

P.S- you get a delicious protein truffle with you Yelp checkin. Double yummmmmmmmmmm . Veggy Street you know the way to my heart"}
{"text":"VEGGY STREET! This place is pure VEGAN/ Plant based GOLD! These **very kind**people are some kind of meatless magicians. If your looking it up on yelp now- read no more and just go! LIKE NOW! It is seriously life changing. I am so so so happy I found them. 

I was apart from my carnivorous family so I decided to treat myself to a vegan bite out! BOY AM I GLAD I DID! 

I than did what we all do. I pulled out my handy iPhone, opened up yelp, and searched \"vegan food.\" 
FIRST on the list.... Veggy Street! So I punched it in my gps and went on my way!  As I walked into the restaurant I was greeted with a big beautiful smile and an even warmer greeting! I got to talking to the gentleman and he quickly learned this was my first visit. He gave me a very delicious  \"welcome\" energy/ protein ball that made me feel like I was cheating by having dessert before dinner. Yum! 

I ordered the 11.11 deal and waited for only a few short moments. Before I knew it- my cheese burger and fries were wrapped up in a bag and ready to go! I thanked the awesome staff and went on my way! 

I hopped on the road and began to unwrap my burger. It was dark so I was not able to see what I was eating. I took my first bite and I'm pretty sure I heard the vegan angels sing in beautiful harmony. I got lost in that first bite. It was honestly the most delicious vegan burger I've ever encountered. As I took my second bite, I had to ask myself if what I was eating was actually  plant based? I had to turn the light on, look down, and remind myself that I had purchased it from Veggy Street. Of course it was plant based. From that point on I guiltlessly devoured my burger. When I arrived to my destination I called every single vegetarian/vegan friend to share the holy grail of a vegan burger that I had just found. YOU GUYS... ITS THAT GOOD! 

Everything about that burger was excellent. Definitely not your average Veggy partty! It's not beany, and it has great texture. (Which I loved) It was unlike any vegan burger I've ever had. I loved that the patty and cheese were both free of soy. Normally I'm not a huge fan of vegan cheese- but THIS cheese that they use was fantastic 
I would put money on it that if I were to bring these burgers back to my meat eating family- they would have no idea that what they were eating vegan burgers. 

I'm practically drooling now thinking about how delicious this place is. I CAN NOT WAIT to go back. I especially can't wait to take my meat loving family and show them that vegan food is Bomb!"}
{"text":"It was delicious I had their spicy chicken, is a Delicious flat bread wrap.. the staff was nice super helpful I really liked it can't wait to continue to try their menu, I'm excited to try their burgers, as well as their juices and smoothies."}
{"text":"Food = 5 stars
Atmosphere = 3 stars

Hence the 4 star rating. I've been here three times now and I have LOVED the food every time. Recently I tried the Caprese Sandwich which was amazing; I've had the cheeseburger the other two times. Absolutely no complaints with the food. My problem has been the music - the last time I was in there, some alternative rock/heavy metal crap was playing. I find it hard to believe that a wide range of people would enjoy that kind of music. I'm usually not one to complain about a restaurant's music, but this was too much. I'll be back for the food though!"}
{"text":"Very happy to have one more vegan place in LV. The owner is a very nice man from Brazil. 
Burger patties are \"Beyond Meat\" products, so for not-vegans it is a wonderful alternative. 
Wish They could have more sauces and spices, salads and desserts."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you're vegan or just trying to stay healthy ! Vegan burger is absolute best burger!!! The place is very clean and welcoming"}
{"text":"Yummy vegan restaurant! Food was fresh. Atmosphere was refreshing. Staff was courteous."}
{"text":"It's a good place to escape All the junk food the casinos serve up. It has a long way to go. Staff some what confused about dairy and non dairy food items. Vegan burger was dry, salad Small, everything else was a big improvement from Vegas food options. Many healthy benefits to Good dairy, like Goats milk, Goats cheese & goats milk yogurt, also Kefir w/probiotics many benefits and replenishes good bacteria. As long as everything is grass fed, no drugs, etc. Remember Steve Jobs was a vegan, died early 50s His vegan chef cooked everything in coconut oil, Cooking coconut oil turns toxic and gave Steve prostate cancer. Don't let Veggy st. Cook anything in oil. This place is a good alternative for all the junk food around. They are trying and Want to do the right thing. They NEED more Knowledge about Nutrition and Healthy Cooking, Eating & drinking. Upgrade standards & keep learning!"}
{"text":"First time eating here I was amazed. Food is really good. I love their veggie cheese burger and sides are great too. The restaurant has cool chic vibe and the staff is friendly and attentive as well. I tried the veggie burrito and I loved it. This is my third time eating this week and I'm craving for another veggie burger. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and tried the Veggy Burger. It was the best veggie burger I've ever had! You can taste the complexities of the flavors and everything is so fresh. The yucca fries were also pretty tasty and had good texture. Great spot to grab a quick lunch. They also have USB ports on some of their larger tables. Might have to come here to do some work. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other items!"}
{"text":"Felt like eating something healthy and this is exactly what it was. The food and drink was great.
I didn't have their tacos but I tried them ... I'm having those next time! Flavor!"}
{"text":"Attention all vegans: YES. This is the fast food place you've been looking for. Legit all vegan plant based burgers that taste delicious. No weird farmy flavors just all natural deliciousness. The fries are golden and crisp to perfection and the location is dank. Clean, open space with tables they connect your electronic devices. This is the burger of the future. Not to mention: quick, speedy, friendly service. Everything a burger place should be without the murder."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great customer service and delicious food. I ordered a Vegan Hot Dog and it was delicious. Will definitely return here again the future. A+"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian and I love meat but someone told me to try the veggie cheeseburger and so I did. The burger was fantastic and felt like I was eating regular ground beef. The bun was a super soft vegan pretzel bun Everything about the burger satisfied me and I feel better about not going and having beef instead. I don't think I'm gonna stop eating meat because of the burger but I look forward to my next Veggie Cheese Burger at Veggy Street"}
{"text":"Wow this place just blew my mind. My bro and I ordered the veggie burgers and we were both so shocked at how realistic the meat patty looked and tasted.

The price is a bit steep, $10 a burger BUT it's the only vegan burger I've tried that is actually close to the real thing.

The pink color of the patty mimics the rare beef color.

Ill definitely be eating here more often."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend during grand opening. Ordered the falafel burger and Veggy burger. I love how they use the beyond meat patty. Definitely tastes like the real thing!! The buns they use are also delicious. Ordered a side of yucca fries and cashoots? I forgot how they spelled it. The burgers were great. The yucca fries seemed overly fried and I wasn't a fan of the cashoots. Definitely would come back for the burgers tho!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Hawaii and saw Veggy Street close to where my sister lives. Very convenient drive took me about 5 minutes. They had pineapple mint water, was refreshing since its so hot outside. I ordered the veggy cheeseburger since its one of the most popular burgers they had. I also ordered the banana tapioca with peanut butter with a zombie shake. The total was 25 dollars. 
The veggy cheeseburger was alright, nothing out of this world. The burger was evenly balanced with the vegetables, the sauce spread with the thick patty and bun. The zombie smoothie was okay. It kind of has a cough syrup vibe, but its not bad. The banana tapioca was okay as well. they should use a different type of dough though. Naan bread would be an amazing substitute for the tapioca dough. 
I would definitely come back again to try different items, so go give Veggy Street a try yourself !!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and everything is so delicious and full of flavor!! I plan on trying something new every time I go there but will definitely have an order of the Veggy street tacos every single time- I'm addicted! Everyone working there is so welcoming and friendly, the atmosphere is awesome but most of all the food is amazing!! 
Veggy street tacos 
Açaí lemonade 

I want a Veggy street in every zip code! Lol"}
{"text":"Wow! So glad this gem just opened up in the neighborhood!! Me & Hubby are trying to transition to healthier options and we came in for lunch. Super friendly staff, got free samples and we had the Falafel & Vegan Burger! Wow! Lots of flavor! Loved the sweet potato fries and the fried mushroom concoction that the Chef let us try should most definitely be added to the menu!!! Thank you for great service!"}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I am not vegan. I am not even vegetarian. (I recently cut red meat from my diet but that's irrelevant). Today, my friend, I call her the Vegan Wizard, introduced me to Veggy Street. She knows how skeptical I am when it comes to trying vegan things and insisted I try this place. I ordered the Veggy cheeseburger with fries (had to). I absolutely loved it. The texture was similar to beef, it didn't fall apart like a lot of veggie burgers I've seen and tried. The burger was PACKED with flavor and the ingredients were so fresh. On top of that, the staff was so friendly and so supportive of my first time vegan burger (silly, i know but it matters okay). The Vegan Wizard wins again! I will be returning!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love trying new vegan food and get excited every time New vegan restaurant opens in town. I've been to this one twice now. The food is so delicious but there are some things to note. They don't really serve full meals unless you want a really expensive meal. I've had the taco made with a tapioca shell and it was quite large and super delicious and unique but sort of left me wanting more. Like a side or two with it. Also tried the vegan burger which was so delicious I almost prefer it to meat burgers. The beyond meat patties they use are amazing. Again though, it was just the burger and it would have costed close to $4 more to get fries while the burger by itself was quite expensive. I forgot how much but I feel like it was around $12. 

I will go back because they do have really good food but I wish their menu was laid out differently so I don't have to spend close to $20 to be full. After alll fries can't possibly cost that much right? 


Bonus though, you get a free protein ball for checking in!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or vegetarian just trying to eat better. This vegan burger is bomb.com! It has the texture of meat that my carnivorous spirit can appreciate. They give you lots of fries, more than I needed. I didn't want to add or take anything away from the burger. It was a little pricey but definitely worth it. I hope they stay open. If I ever go vegan, it's nice to know that I have options that are really tasty. If you're trying to eat better, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Hello everybody my name is Milica and I'm Veggy Street cheeseburger addict. I've been coming in already 4 days in a row, this stuff is gold!! Best burger I've had in my life, even before I decided to go meatless. Staff is suuuper nice and attentive and they always give me a sample of their protein truffle which is also delicious! It has all the good stuff. Other things I've tried like yucca fries and chicken wrap are bomb as well. Just love this place and feel happy that I've discovered it. It would be nice if they had some kind of loyalty program for those people coming in often"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful casual vegetarian restaurant with a really cool and friendly vibe.  The staff was very courteous and enthusiastic which made dining there a pleasure.  I had the vegan chicken tapioca which is like a huge taco but with a tortilla made from tapioca and topped with a generous amount of herbs.  It was delicious!  I look forward to trying more of their menu in future visits.  

Update: I had their cheeseburger with fries on my last visit and that was very good as well.  And the service was just as friendly as the first, if not friendlier!"}
{"text":"This is the best if not the second best plant-based eatery in Vegas. You get more quality than Vege-Way, and more variety in the menu. Plus, the people at the register are super knowledgable, kind, and will happily answer any question or concern. Top notch, 5 stars!  #igotbeefwithbeef"}
{"text":"Over the past 6 months, I converted to a pescatarian (no meat, only fish and veggies), and this place made me rethink my decision to become vegan. Their staff was extremely knowledgable and polite about all of their products! Ignore any negative reviews that they may have, as the gentleman who helped me, told me SPECIFICALLY that there were two separate menus--one vegan and one vegetarian and also pointed out the differences and the ability to mix and match.

I ordered the Chicken Tacopioca and it was slammin' good! The beyond meat they used tasted just like the real deal, only I didn't feel guilty because it was all plant based! The fries were nice and crispy just the way I like them and the prices were considerably reasonable as far as vegan/vegetarian restaurants in town go. If you are trying to change your diet, both ethically and for health purposes, or even if you are an omnivore, I highly recommend Veggy Street!"}
{"text":"1st Time here. Looking forward to yummy lunch!
Great friendly atmosphere. Can't wait to for my first bite!!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, but if there are delicious options that are, I go for them. I'm obsessed with the street tacos right now. This place is clean and simple and very casual. I'm not understanding why vegan dishes are so expensive, but $10-12 for a burger with no side or drink is insane and very much a deterrent. It was good, but not $10-12 worth of happiness. Either way, I'm still exploring and will be back."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times, the food is awesome.  Love the zombie smoothie and the vegetarian burger.  For whatever reason though the bald guy cashier is very rude.  That's why I give it 3 stars for the service.  Food flavor is a 5."}
{"text":"I love this place! Went on Saturday to fill up on vegan food before a wedding. I was very impressed! The restaurant does not carry any meat... 100% Vegan & Vegetarian. The cashier was very knowledgable and mentioned a \"buy 2 get 1 free\" Vegan burger promotion! We ordered the 3 vegan burgers and vegan parmesan fries. The burgers are the Beyond patties with Follow Your Heart cheese. Everything was delicious and filling! We were even given a free smoothie sample. I recommend this place to all burger-lovers!"}
{"text":"On my first visit everything went well. I was helped by a short \"stocky\" girl who was very informative and friendly. She was enthusiastic about the menu and honest about the selections. 

I ordered the pressed chicken sandwich with a pretzel bun. That pretzel bun was some amazing stuff! The sandwich was tasty but after awhile I took out the fake meat chunks. 

I ate the three little deep-fried ball things as a side. I believe they're called co-see-something idk. But I really didn't care for them. I actually ended up sharing them with another customer sitting nearby. She liked them. 

The second time I went I was greeted by a different girl. She seemed a bit nonchalant about being there. I ordered the beyond burger with fries. Anywho the problem I really had was when I got my food I asked if they had a ranch. The cashier that took my order said no. I asked if there were any other sauces and she said yes. I asked what was in this other sauce and she replied, \"I'm not sure\". She didn't even offer to find out. Seeing how this is her job, she needs to know the product. 

Other than that incident, cool spot. They also have 2 outside tables."}
{"text":"I walked in and wasn't greeted by anyone who worked there. The cashier was bare minimum friendly. I had the pressed chicken sandwich and tried the crazy falafel wrap. Both were average. There was also a smell in the restaurant. If the food was good or the service was better I would return but since nothing was great I more than likely won't return."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and the food was out of this world!! Friendly staff that enjoy where they work and what this place represents. Great to go to a Vegan restaurant that truly cares about the product they produce. My personal favorite is the Yucca fries. Once you try them you will never settle for less!"}
{"text":"SO good. I am not even vegetarian but find myself craving this place often!  Everything I have ever tried from here is so delicious and creative. The \"cheeseburger\" is incredible.  I get it with the gluten free bun, which is a tapioca bun. I've never had a GF bun like that, but it is so good and contributes to the flavor (which is tough for a GF bun! Usually they are flavorless and just fall apart by bite two.) the yucca fries are also so good, and seasoned so perfectly."}
{"text":"Oh man!!! Wow!!! This was my first time eating at Veggy Street. I had the Veggy cheeseburger and I'm speechless. Talk about absolutely delicious!!! The patty has a scrumptious flame broiled flavor,cheese has a delicious American cheddar taste and topped off with crisp lettuce and tomato. The pretzel bun ties all this deliciousness together beautifully. I highly recommend the Veggy cheeseburger. Do yourself a favor and head over to Veggy Street right now and feast on One for yourself. 

   I also tried a Soda called Guarana Antarctica. I can't quite put my finger on the flavor but the logo has 2 cherries on the can so that's the flavor I think I was tasting. If you like sugary drinks like I do I think you'll like this one too. 

  I really like the dining room as well. Clean, crisp and comfortable. All tables have 3 built in USB ports.....very convenient. 

  Last but not least the staff were all friendly , pleasant and helpful. Can't wait to return and try more delicious food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Okay so iv been basically vegetarian my whole life until going vegan and have never had a beyond burger nor did I realize they use them but my boyfriend and I ordered the veggy eleven burger and instantly he loved his burger and I tried mine and could not stand it at all because it tasted so real. We told them about it and they were very understanding and offered me their falafel burger instead and it was so good! I hate being the one to be picky about my food but they were so nice about it!"}
{"text":"Veggy Street!? What an amazing new place for all vegans and vegetarians and even if you want to just try non meat options. 

I ordered the veggie burger with the vegan cheese option. It came out and I expected it to be like grainy and veggie patty like consistency, but i was wrong. It tasted just like a burger!!! It was amazing!

I would definitely come back and try it again, for less than $10 and if you check in you get a truffle, which wasn't my favorite part. It tasted too grainy and not sweet at all, but I would definitely come back and try other options."}
{"text":"I had the chicken wrap and french fries, friend had the pot salad and the Mother Bomb. She did not like her food (salad was super small, barely any dressing; said the smoothie wasn't very good). I asked for no onions in mine, there were still onions and it was missing avocado. But the food was good!! We tried a protein truffle sample and it was absolutely amazing.

The cashier working was super nice was gave me 20% off because they were out of vegan buns. Their service was attentive and the place was very clean and nice."}
{"text":"not sure about what's organic and what's not

good falafel

all smoothie have hella caffeine"}
{"text":"Tried this place out on Monday after working out! It was so delicious! My husband coworker told us about it and it did not disappoint. Really can't tell the difference between a hamburger and a vegan burger because they made it so well... highly recommend this place! plus it's better for u than a regular fast food place!!!"}
{"text":"I just tried this place today so very very good. They were very helpful in answering my questions. I ordered the crazy falafel sandwich. First of all I'm very picky with my falafel and this was spot on. Seasoned perfectly not to greasy and not mushy. The veggie mix on the sandwich was such a treat had a bit of a kick which I like. My only thoughts would be to take the avocado out but that's just my preference. Also got the protein truffles which are out of this world good.I got the zombie drink as well. It is good but I make my own smoothies so this is a little treat but I like my combos biased of course . Definitely check them out you won't regret it. I'm vegan and it is so nice to find a new spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"The vegan burger was very good but it is pricey. Although, the vegan hotdogs was absolutely disgusting it tasted so bad I spit it out right after I complete waste of seven dollars. Small menu and not really a full meal for one I felt kind of hungry after it was also very expensive. $12 for a hamburger with no meat???"}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing as well as the food!! I tried my first San Pelegríno here and fell in love, overall happy this place opened up close to my home."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday and had the veggy cheeseburger. I was shook! Seriously, it was so so flavorful (I'm going back for another today). It was served on a pretzel bun which was delightfully soft and airy (unlike other pretzel buns that I generally don't like). We received some free protein truffles which were yummy! We loved the service - everyone was very kind and attentive. This might be our new go-to place!"}
{"text":"So, I'm not a vegan, but can appreciate a good veggie burger. This burger (the 11 burger) was so good, I came back for a second one in the same day for dinner! Also got the vegan super dog for my daughter. Didn't tell her it wasn't meat, though because I don't let her have hot dogs normally, she was curious and happy (she 7). She loved it!!! Peas, tomato/basil sauce and all!!! She even ate the grilled onions!!! I loved it too, so far I'm a big fan!

George the owner is super nice as well as his employees. Always nice to have an owner so invested in his place and the experience of his customers!

Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I had the cheeseburger and a pineapple drink. The cheeseburger was good, and the juice was ok. In my opinion, the prices are high for the quantity of food given. It was also a bit overwhelming to order something from the menu. The side and drink are extra which made it more overwhelming with selection, ingredients, and prices. The place was clean, and some of the employees seemed friendly."}
{"text":"I found the place on yelp and went in there today for the first time. I have to say it was amazing.  The customer service was over he top and the food was great. The chef from the back even came out and greeted us and cleared our table. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Veggy street is a great concept. I'm not a vegan but I do try new things. Jorge the owner is a very nice guy, their menu speaks for itself. I had the mystery couple, WOW! Great combination of flavors!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious. I've had the street sandwich a few times and it's always as wonderful as the first time. Great consistent quality."}
{"text":"The \"crazy falafel\" (falafel in a vegan laffa wrap) was fresh and tasty, and reasonably priced. Maybe they're understaffed, because it took a while for someone to take my order at the counter, and a while longer before the food actually came out. But it was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"This food was delicious. I am not a vegan but they honestly have one of the best burgers I have ever had! My friend had the chicken tacopioca and the toasted caprese both tasted amazing! So glad I got to try this spot."}
{"text":"This was thee BEST vegan burger I've ever eaten. The patty even resembles a rare hamburger. The consistency is great and even has a grilled flavor. The sauce and cheese compliment the burgers so well. I can't say enough about how good it was. I can't wait to go back to try something new."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is really good. I tried the chicken taco thing lol and the pretzel burger. My kids had fries and falafels. Their dad isn't vegan and said the food was top 5 for him. The whole family was happy. Definitely coming back! We ordered through grub hub, but next time we'll go to the location."}
{"text":"My mom and I have been here a handful of times over the last 2 weeks. 

We come here for the cheeseburger. 

Not a fan of the açaí bowls here. There's a hint of cherry flavor cough syrup while eating it and I would also like to see it more thick not soupy. 

Parking lot, casual, outdoor tables are dog friendly.  

We will be back for the cheeseburgers. 

Love seeing plant based vegan in the city."}
{"text":"While I personally am not a big fan of the beyond meat patty, the burger was good. They put roasted quinoa and some kind of delicious sauce on it! My boyfriend ate all of his and finished mine, (They are huge and I never eat a lot at once)he loved it. It's very similar to how a real burger would taste. Next time I'm excited to try the falafel burger. Which btw, the falafel bites were amazing! 
The owner of the restaurant and all of the staff were so incredibly nice and helpful which always creates a better experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We found this place on our way to another place to eat. Both my boyfriend and I are vegetarian, and we've tried a couple places that have veggie burgers. We both agree, that this place has the best veggie burgers. The taste and texture is great! And we love how it's not greasy like vegeway. It's super healthy and clean. 
With our burger we got Parmesan fries and also tried the Inferno burrito. Not a fan of the tapioca dough but it was pretty filling. 
Employees are friendly! And they have complementary water infused with fruits. 
We will totally be back!"}
{"text":"No need to be vegan to come here!

Actually, you need to like food and awesome seasoning. ;)


Took my very traditional and conventional eater grandma here. She's old school. Didn't tell her what kind of food it was, just asked if she wanted a burger or cheeseburger. She wanted no cheese, so burger. I got the cheeseburger with yucca fries (YUMMMO!!).  Waited patiently for her to finish to break the news that she had just eaten a meatless burger. She couldn't believe it. Then we had their awesome falafel and protein balls. Got an açaí bowl to go and cannot wait to go back. 

George is the owner and he's very invested in his place, so expect excellence and consistency. Both keys to a very successful and prosperous business."}
{"text":"Ordered the Veggy Cheeseburger and it was fabulous! I'm excited to try more options on their menu. Order was ready super quick. I would highly recommend checking them out. They use the Beyond Meat burgers, which as a recently former meat eater, I can say are the closest thing you'll get to a traditional burger--but waaaaaayyy better!!"}
