{"text":"This place has very good nihari and kabab's and nan's are hood as well. Overall this place has really good food but they really need to improve bbq chicken"}
{"text":"Went for  their breakfast special at around 11am.the place was packed and people are lined up to get in.  For was good but not anything superb that would create a line that big.  Made me think and i centre to the conclusion that the location of this place is optimal, with easy parking and a name \"nirala\", that is used so often and every thitd desi restaurant is named nirala.  The place used to be caked safa halal food before but newer owner seems to have gotten the attention and is doing good by cooking decent food and treating customers with respect."}
{"text":"Great good. Nihari paya bihari kabab  Boanless biryani"}
{"text":"Poor service, does not have any manners.  Typical don't care attitude. Waited for 15 minutes at table.  it was Saturday night had customers at two tables and all three waiters were busy doing nothing, standing in a corner chit chatting. Off course when the Manager or maybe owner asked them to go and take the order they even ignored him. Maybe they were following the managers attitude. Avoid, you will be better off eating at home."}
{"text":"Really tasty halwa puri, nihari and lamb paya. I would suggest them to redecorate the restaurant and make it clean."}
{"text":"Utter waste of money. Don't  just don't order food from here and I mean it. We do eat from Tandoori Time, Karachi kitchen, Patna Kabab house,  and Shaheen Tikka and Kabab house quite frequently and we know what NORMAL food should  taste like. Every restaurant in this age and time offer three levels of spiciness MILD, MEDIUM,  & HOT; where as, this place offers only one kind. HOT like hell. My husband and I both got sick with sore throat from the spiciness and piles upon piles of visible traces of green chilli which you can't sperate from ur food. Horrible. For ur info, we ordered chicken seekh  kabab,  chicken biryani, and keep a Naan.  Apart from the food being too spicy, they literally had stuffed one tea spoon of ground meat in their naan to charge you $4.50 . Not worth your money. Shaheen Restaurant or Tandoori time don't do that to ur keema naan at least."}
{"text":"Love this place, naan was fresh and tasty. Kababs were good and they're nihari is something special. Prices are reasonable, will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Good food. I just wish they added more paneer chunks in their paneer korma, though. But still, food was delicious!"}
{"text":"You have to come here for their nihari!! It's the best I've had in a very long time. The meat is soft and tender! Service was excellent too.  Apparently their breakfast specials on the weekends is what they are known for. Got to come back here on the weekend now!   Owners are nicest people you will meet.  Must go here!"}
{"text":"Aside from my traditional western breakfast, our family decided to try Indian/ Pakistani.  Nirala has been here for some time, though the interior is basic, they can surely cook up a storm whether it be dine-in, take out, or sweets!  You can sometimes find yourself waiting in line especially on weekends during early to late breakfast hours. Their traditional breakfast served on a stainless steel food tray, called Thali.  We had their homemade halwa, channa (chick pea), pickles, yogurt all served with a puri (small roti).  On the side we also ordered their Nihari gravy curry which was also served with fresh naans that were delicious. Probably one of the best nihari's I've ever had.  Overall the place isn't fancy but if you're looking for good Indian / Pakistani food do try this place!"}
{"text":"Best halwa puri in town. Tried their Nihari as well was very good not the best in town. Their naan is also very well made."}
{"text":"The halwa puri with channa is really good. Kinda like of Shaheen. And yes, these two places only serve the authentic karachi style 'lahori' cholay for breakfast. The nihari was a little watererd down but full of flavour. The fresh naans was the icing on the cake. Their 'chai' needs to be overhauled. I have had better tea at gas stations.  I highly recommend the halwa puri channa breakfast. But please, take home-brewed chai in a thermos to enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast today I got the nihari and boy is it tasty with the naan which is flaky and buttery thw nihari is one of the tastiest nihari I have ever tried when I went for breakfast they have a special it was fully packed I tried other items from here such as biriyani which is spicy but delicious I think it was of the best Pakistani goods I have ever had"}
{"text":"We had iftar buffet... line up was so long we didnt get any appetizers and they didnt even fill it up, not just that, they only had biriyani, chicken curry, halim, chana, nihari and tandoori chicken for the main course but it was mentioned in the website they suppose to serve butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, paya, gulab jamun, kheer, rasgulla but its a lie, for desert they only served pre packed rasmalai. They shouldnt be cheatinf with people during the month of ramadan. I didnt like being rude during this holy month but i am pisses off because i invited my guest in this restaurant for iftar, i paid for the food but my guests didnt get appetizers thats very sad."}
