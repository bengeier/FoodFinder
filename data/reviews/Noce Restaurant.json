{"text":"My husband and I absolutely adore this restaurant. It's home for us. When we want to celebrate an anniversary, cope with challenges, have a simple date night or share an unforgettable meal with loved ones - we go to Noce. The reasons are simple. Incredible food, superb wine list and fantastic people. You are in great hands - especially with Chris or David guiding you thru your culinary experience and with George and his skilled team in the kitchen. We recently celebrated our 5th anniversary at Noce. It was incredible! White Truffle Tagliatelle! Our favourites include Frittura Mista, Ravioli ai Funghi, followed by Bistecca alla Fiorentina!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant around late 2011 and the only thing that comes to mind thinking about this place is the \"egg\" pasta. I can't remember the name of the entr√©e but I will come back again in hopes that I will have the dish again."}
{"text":"The Noce experience was a good one, the staff and the owner are very friendly and helpful. The meals were very good and the portions were very good. The Salami appetizer was very good. The resteraunt uses one of the best olive oils that i have ever had. We will definately go back, it is so much fun people watching while we eat outside.
Thanks for a great memory.
Only one issue...............NO DEBIT

{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this out for a while, and he romantically booked us a reservation for valentines day dinner at 7 pm. 

Staff was friendly and courteous. We were surprised how few tables were occupied, guess we are early eaters! The tables did fill up more by the time we left a bit before 9. The average age of the dinners was also a little more mature (we're early 30s). It is also a fairly large restaurant with a front and back room. We were seated in the back. 

We enjoyed our appetizers - the fried calamari, shrimp and lobster were great, lightly fried with a slight spicy sauce. It was more than enough to share and was $23. Our favourite were the meat stuffed olives though, would return for just those for sure. 

For the mains, we both had pasta. I had the small portion of chocolate tagliatelle with wild boar ($19), and he had the large size Gorgonzola gnocchi. The Gnocchi is the soft kind, not chewy. Neither of us finished our mains though. Both were ok, but we've had better and not much different than Terronis, despite a price differential. 

For dessert, we split a chocolate tart, with raspberries on top. For $14 was expecting something a little fancier, but again, nothing too different than a tart you could get at a local bakery. 

All in all, glad we tried it out, but no burning desire to return."}
{"text":"Pricey but, without a doubt, the best meal I've had in years. Phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday night at 9:00 and it was a touch quiet but that did not take away from the food in the slightest. Service was attentive and not overbearing. I'm picky with soups as few restaurants get them right but Noce hit it exactly right with their lentil soup which was perfect for a cold rainy night. Bufala mozzarella wasn't soggy but still melted in your mouth exactly like its supposed to. Went with the their special of the night which was a shrimp rissotto cooked in lobster stock. Nice. Well done. Go here for a nice  intimate meal."}
{"text":"Went there at 6 pm sharp, to sit outside, under the plastic tent. There are only a handful of weeks that allow outside dining in Toronto, btw. 

Three waiters standing around (outside) staring holes in the air; not a single customer anywhere in sight (well, a little early, perhaps). 

We have a baby stroller in tow (plus baby), and ask for a table outside. ALL RESERVED is the response; but perhaps you would like to sit over there, behind the sewer line? Mind you, again, there is NOT A SINGLE CUSTOMER anywhere. - OK, how about we sit inside then if all the tables none of which are physically occupied are taken? TOO SMALL for a stroller inside.

But wait, there is not a single customer in sight!!! (plus, shiny lightbulb, do you think we are going to hang out for four hours with a baby in tow anyway?). 

Well, how about you sit in the back behind the sewer line? 

I mentally pack away my shiny AMEX, THE ONE that is - per their own marketing - only available upon invitation; we turn around, walk down the street and, guess what, we unpack the card at Terroni's and have a terrific meal. Perhaps more rustic than what we would have gotten at Noce, but I paid gladly. In fact, I realize now why there is often A LINE forming outside Terroni's that when we left reached all the way out onto the sidewalk. 

Thanks. Will not try again although we have a place within walking distance. I guess our budding relationship never got off the ground."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious with a friend.
We were seated outside, and soon after the bread basket arrived. Both the sourdough and the focaccia were very good, as was the olive oil that came with them. 

I started with the white gazpacho. You are probably wondering what could be interesting about a gazpacho that's not even red. This dish was one of the best soups I had in a long time. First, the consistency was not entirely smooth, it had a pleasant bit of unevenness, some small bits here and there. Second, there was just a hint of acidity (from the tomatoes, I imagine) in the dish, that was balanced out perfectly by the beans and the croutons. Very interesting and refreshing starter.
I also tasted the carpaccio, which tasted great, even though I am not huge on carpaccio itself. The beef was sliced very thinly, great taste, and the vegetables were fresh, so they balanced the meat wonderfully. 

For the main course, I ordered the European sea bass, which was thoroughly impressive. First, I was given three very nice pieces of the fish, which were grilled to perfection. Again, the balance of the dish was spot on: the chickpea ragout worked very well to add more substance, and the taggiasche olive tapenade was packed with flavor. The dish also had hints of tomato from the sundried tomato oit.

My friend had the ricotta ravioli, which I also tried. The ricotta was smooth and creamy, while the pasta was cooked al dente, a perfect combination. The vegetables and the parmigiano complemented the fresh taste of the ravioli.

For dessert, we both had the tiramisu - both of the other choices were more tart in flavor, which is fair since it was a hot summer day.
The tiramisu was nice and creamy, bringing together the flavors in perfect harmony. Neither the coffee nor the rum taste dominated the dish, which is perfect for a summer dinner. Those who expect a more hard-line \"espresso-booze\" taste in their tiramisu might have an issue with this, but since I'm not a fan of either, I was very pleased.

The waiters were polite and professional, knowledgeable about the menu. There was one occasion when I had to ask for more water, but after that our glasses were refilled quickly.

Overall, this is clearly a place where everyone knows what they are doing. The flavor combinations in the dishes were all harmonious and the execution was very accurate. The portions were just the right size as well. The interior looked nice as well, and the service was excellent. 

For the $45 summerlicious dinner, this was a great experience, and I'll definitely be returning"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a Wed night and the restaurant was not busy at all, so I can't really comment on what the place would be like on a busy night. What I can say is the following:

Food = amazing. Our friends gave us the tip to order the mushroom and truffle ravioli... which is not on the menu, you just need to know to ask for it... strange I know - it was incredible!!! I also tried the sweetbreads which was also amazing (on a side note I tricked my wife into trying sweetbreads as she did not know what they were - she loved them until I told her what they were. We had a similar experience with foie gras, and a few dim sum dishes - never gets old to me)

Service = awesome - an Italian gentleman walked us through the menu, made some nice recommendations for wine, and let my wife taste a selection before ordering a glass, also got us a serving of the \"not on the menu\" mushroom truffle ravioli

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience here and will likely be back soon."}
{"text":"Noce is an old school Italian food gem hidden amongst a gentrified Westside Toronto. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The food is like something you would devour at your Nonna's Sunday meal. Fresh ingredients and handmade pasta make a meal at Noce an authentic Italian treat. 

The ambiance is romantic, with a view of Trinity Bellwood park across the street. While you sit and slowly sip wine from their wonderful selections of wine you become very still and watch the hustle and bustle of Queen St. W through big windows unfold in front of you. 

Top it all off with one of their fresh made deserts and wonderfully rich espresso."}
{"text":"The right answer for a cold and windy Toronto day.  Greatly enjoyed their three course Winterlicious prix fixe menu.  Great service, warm and causal atmosphere with a great cocktail and wine selection.  Add this place to your Must Do list."}
{"text":"Every time I go, this place never disappoints. A shared appetizer of grilled octopus was delicious, not too fishy, perfectly grilled and seasoned. They fly it in from Morocco twice a week. My dining companion had the fish special, which tonight was the whole branzino (Mediterranean sea bass),which she found delicious and cooked to perfection. I had the wonderful ravioli, filled with roasted red pepper and sausage, in a divinely light tomato sauce. The wine list is great, with a nice selection by the glass. We skipped dessert  this time but they are worth it as well. Overall, Noce is classy, the food is excellent and the service top notch. Always a great time!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's day and enjoyed a great meal. 

The sirloin steak was my favourite item on the menu, they cut it up for you and present it very nicely. Also had the beef carpaccio which was delicious, the cod paste on polenta which was ok, their well known funghi pasta which was good but the portion felt small (to be fair we shared it), and finally the tiramisu. They've changed a lot of classic items from their old menu (like the funghi pasta and tiramisu) and to be honest although the new items are good, I don't they're quite as good as the classic versions that Noce previously served (pre renos).

Ambience is very nice and wait staff was very attentive and gave great recommendations. Overall fantastic date spot if you're willing to splurge a little."}
{"text":"Went here for winterlicious and firstly, I must say that the food was very well made. The carne crude appetizer and sex in a pan dessert was phenomenal and absolutely loved them. The entree was very tasty but this is also where they lose major points. 

Ordered the aged rib-eye steak (substituted with strip loin for the day) and it was.... beyond tiny. Basically the size I would expect from an appetizer. They gave 2 slices of steak totaling maybe 2-3 oz with 2-3 brussel sprouts on a bed of sauce per person. I was in such shock I even forgot to take a photo. Not only that, my girlfriend's steak was medium well when she ordered medium rare and the waiter was extremely hesitant to send it back and even had the audacity to say it was cooked correctly when it looked entirely different from everyone else's medium rare steak (3 other orders).

It was a total ripoff at $53. With the amount spent for 2 people, we could've went to a good steakhouse and had a 3 course meal there. While I did love the food, I left the restaurant hungry and sans $69. I won't be going back at those prices."}
{"text":"Gorgeous decor, terrific service, and wood FIRE! They use it to great effect wherever they can. Definitely will return to try a pasta dish."}
{"text":"Best carpaccio in the city, great gnocchi, great patio and I see a lot of complaints about $9 bottled water but they ask you flat, sparkling or tap so that's really on you. Also if you don't have $9 for a bottle of water then you definitely don't have the $40 for their mains and I have no idea what you're doing here anyways."}
{"text":"Lunch - it was good, but did not blow my mind.  The bread selection was good and I really liked their olive oil for dipping.  To start, I had the butternut squash soup with truffle oil and parm.  It was not that great - I found it tasteless, to be honest.  But then I bounced back with my main!  I had the gnocchi with tomato and basil.  It was nicely done and I enjoyed it.  I always find at every restaurant they give you too much gnocchi and I could not finish it even though it was yummy.

The service was pretty okay.  They were very polite and I liked everyone.  But what I don't like is really expensive bottles of water.  This isn't Europe - we can drink tap unless you want it carbonated.  Our table of 6 went through many bottles and it was really pricey.  $9 a person!  And forced gratuity because there were 6 or more of us.  That aside, it was a fairly okay experience although I doubt I will return again."}
{"text":"Dinner for four at Noce was a good experience. Food was solid, but did not blow us away. The restaurant is charming, and our waiter was personable and attentive. We ordered bread and olives (remember when stuff like that was complimentary?), and two of us shared the Noce salad. For main dishes, we had the funghi pizza, the ravioli al funghi, the gnocchi and a special shrimp dish. All were good, but the only thing that seemed to get raves was the shrimp, though no one was unhappy with their meal."}
{"text":"My best friend took me here for a birthday dinner after wanting to try somewhere new (to us) and stumbling upon it on Yelp.

I'm so glad that I did!

The octopus dish has some of the most delicious octopus that I've had in the city, and with a very generous serving size. 

The gnocchi was heavenly and melt in your mouth delicious. 

And, the wine list was also enticing! We settled on a rose this time because it was a hot summer night. 

Lastly, we had a corn cake for dessert that had fruit pieces and ice cream.

I would definitely come here again! I left for Italy the day after this meal and found myself ordering octopus and gnocchi almost nightly but birthing came close to those at Noce."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

I had high hope for this restaurant and we came here on a Sat night for my friends 30s birthday. 

The entrance was quite hidden. If you come from Queen St and you will see the dark green themed store front and patrons eating meals but you won't find a door. Then you turn into the side street and will find a closed patio and some doors but nope they don't lead you to the restaurant. Keep walking until you see a red tent-ish which is the real entrance. The different colour theme throw me off quite a bit. 

There were 5 of us and decided to order a few items to share. We got a cows tripe app and a lobster app, a truffle pesto pasta and a pork pasta, a sausage pizza and a 15 oz of bone in ribeye. We finished it with a small cake we brought which the restaurant was nice to not charge cutting fees. 

Overall the food was good but nothing was amazing and the truffle pasta smells/tastes nothing truffle, and the two apps are cooked in a way you wouldn't even know you are eating tripes or lobster, which in my opinion isn't the best thing. This is because in my opinion the texture and flavour of the food materials are essential to the overall experience and if they were overpowered by the method of cooking or sauces, then the dish is not really bringing the best part of that materials out. The ribeye was tender and juicy, nicely done. 

Also we were given a 2 hour window, which was communicated on the day, not before. It is understandable for a busy Sat night but realistically for multiple courses and a big group, it was a bit tight. We had to leave immediately after we finished eating."}
{"text":"I came to Noce with a couple of friends for dinner and it didn't wow us away. Considering that the restaurant is on the pricey side, we were surprised. 

The servers were courteous and attentive. We hadn't ordered yet and we wanted to switch tables from outside to inside, as it was unbearably hot and the server graciously obliged. He gave us a fabulous table, right by the big, beautiful window where we had a view of Trinity Bellwoods Park.  

Be forewarned, if you are hungry, don't come here, as the portions are extremely tiny. I had the Mozzarella di Bufala, which wasn't flavourful enough. I also had the Cornish hen, which was decent sized. However, my friend who had the ravioli, which I'm told was delicious, wolfed down his meal and he was still hungry, so I offered him a piece of my Cornish hen. It was cooked well, but yet again, there was a lack of flavour.

My favourite dessert, the tiramisu was exceptional, but again, the portion size was too small. Dinning at Noce was a mediocre experience for all of us. Would I return for the tiramisu? Not likely."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto.

I have never had a bad meal at Noce. Meals begin with fresh bread and their olive oil which is sourced from an exclusive olive grove in Italy. The fresh pasta they serve is simply delicious. You just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, a bad experience at this restaurant. There are thousands of amazing restaurants in Toronto. Go somewhere where they take customer service seriously. Will not go back here."}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible service. Food came out Cold but it was so good I still ate it. Waited 15 min for drinks, each round. Felt like my existence was inconsequential."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner.  Despite the large group, the service was pleasant and quick.

I started off with fried calimari.  It was pretty good but what I expected.  The portion size was pretty generous, pieces were crisp and there wasn't an excessive amount of batter.

Then I had the Insalata di Funghi, a salad with grilled mushrooms, baby arugula, and balsamic dressing.  Again, the salad was good, decently sized but also within expectations. 

For my main, I had Ravioli ai Funghi, which was highly recommended by the waiter.  It was OK.  It was savoury but didn't really have much of a punch.  Portion size was within expectations (a bit on the smaller size) but I didn't have mushroom in my stomach at this point (pun intended).

Given the energy put towards creating a sophisticated ambiance, the WTF moment was going to the washroom.  I felt like I was warped into the bathroom of cheap Chinese diner.  It was OK, just really weird.

Admittedly, I went in with low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised at how decent everything turned out. 

Overall: decent Italian food, out of place washroom."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Noce numerous times over the past two years. The service is always excellent. Very friendly and attentive.

The food is so good. It's fresh, simple and delicious. Noce has the best gnocchi ever! There is no arguing. You won't find a better gnocchi in Toronto. 

The veal and other meat dishes are also very, very good. They never overcook the meat. The beef carpaccio is a fantastic appetizer. I also really like the Noce salad. 

I definitely suggest checking it out."}
{"text":"I went here with a birthday group this past weekend. They had a big room in the back, but for the most part this place seemed a little cramped for the crowd of more than 20. I'm not sure what the rest of the restaurant looked like.

Inside the place seems fairly decent, but nothing really memorable. Given that it was an Italian restaurant it was amusing to hear what sounded like Cuban radio playing throughout the dining area.

The service was pretty slow. I'll concede that it was a large group and that can cause delays, but we waited more than 30 minutes for drink orders, and probably 45mins for bread to end up on the table (worth noting is that the bread basket came with a variety of rolls and breads which was great)

Now for the food. Mine was fantastic. A mushroom truffle ravioli in what seemed like a truffle flavoured oil sauce (this was great with the left over bread). For some reason this was listed online, but not on their menu, again a hint at a lack of organization.

My wife had the Pork Tenderloin, which she finished but repeatedly commented that my meal was much better. I'm not too sure if that means the overall menu is \"hit and miss\".

Now for those menus... I get it, its an Italian restaurant. But why does that mean the menu headings and dish titles need to be in Italian? If they were looking to recreate the confusion of being an english speaking tourist vacationing in Florence with no idea how to distinguish an appetizer from an entree then Noce has succeeded. 

Why do restaurants do this? I wouldn't be surprised if Shell get's it's oil from the middle east, that doesn't mean the gas pumps are labeled in Farsi! This drivers me CRAZY.

Another note, the wine list is extensive, but it gets pricey very very quickly.

Overall, the Truffle Ravioli is great. I'd say at $24 it's worth the visit, but I'm not sure much more about would make me go back."}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious menu. For starters I had the Noce salad with romaine hearts, walnuts, pear (could not taste it) and a little shaved cheese. It was on the bland site. I chose the seabream filet for main....mmmm that was very good. I love the base of fregola (little pasta bits) very hearty. For dessert I had tiramisu-whoohoo! It was excellent. I also tried a little of my friends mango sorbet and gelato (vanilla?) it was fantastic-best sorbet I've ever had.

I think the part Noce could work on was service. Don't get me wrong, our waiter was polite. But they did take a long time to come back and take our orders. They were not attentive with filling water. And I wasn't crazy about the wine suggestion (considering the mammoth wine collection this restaurant has I was expecting more knowledge/better suggestions).

The restaurant itself is beautiful. I like the big windows. The bathrooms are a bit outdated downstairs, doesn't really jive with the quality of the dining area.

Finally there was a small mix up with our bills. We asked for separate and somehow a few of us ended up being charged gratuity for our meals, but also that of our friends (while our lucky friends were not charged :). Not a terrible thing to happen, but little things like this irk me...I don't like double checking my bill and seeing errors, then having to ask about it. 

Don't let the billing incident dissuade you, this is a nice restaurant. Perhaps a little more high end than my usual style (out of my winterlicious picks this year, I enjoyed Grace better). But many of my dining crew loved their meals and the ambience. We all have our tastes :)."}
{"text":"I went to Noce for lunch with my dad a couple months ago and the experience was most enjoyable. The patio out front is beautiful, covered but sunny (my favourite kind) and it's a great place to people watch on Queen. The service was fantastic and we had a long chat with the owner about when to vacation in Italy (September) and about how business was going. 

I had La Caprese salad (buffalo mozzarella and oven roasted tomatoes) to start and it was so simple and delicious I could have eaten 10 plates. I also dared to try my dad's carpaccio (raw beef) and it melted in my mouth - I definitely recommend it. For my main course, I ordered their fish of the day which was a sea bass with vegetables and potatoes and it was very tasty. 

Noce is truly Italian dining at it's finest and the prices fit accordingly.  This is not a place for those on a budget, but if you really want a delicious Italian meal, this is the place to be. 

A little trivia - Noce means walnut in Italian.  The restaurant is located on the corner of Queen St. W and Walnut Ave."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a friends birthday. Despite being a huge group of 20, it was honestly the best service I've had in years. The staff was so fantastic, the drinks were delicious, the food was fabulous. Decent prices. They have a \"martini hour\" from 9-10, where a martini is $10. They've also got oysters for $1.25 a piece. Not sure if this was just a Friday special, but we definitely took advantage! The staff came by frequently to make sure we were happy, well fed, and had drinks in our hand. When a few of us had had quite a bit to drink, they brought us out a plate of grilled bread at no charge. I had the fungi pizza (delicious), and a few bites of steak that was perfectly cooked. Cannot say enough about how lovely this place was! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Eating at Noce is an event. Excellent service, knowledgeable staff, and the happy bustle that comes from dining amongst other discriminating guests. But here's the but. Not all the food blew me away. Perhaps it's because some of my friends are such good cooks that I tend to eat well a lot of the time. The salads we tried were good, but not great.  Fresh, certainly, but nothing that really stood out. As one of my friends said \"I could make this in my sleep\".  The appetizers were a little better. Delicious calamari, lovely beef carpaccio, and a buratta cheese plate that drove us into a frenzy.. 

The main courses were all over the place. At the bottom of the heap was a shrimp and marscapone risotto that was rather wet and tasteless. Nicer was a veal dish that was much appreciated by it's eater, but as I don't eat veal, I can't attest. Then there was the signature wild mushroom ravioli that had us all swooning. Truly seductive. I offered a sample to the risotto-eating guy, who now looked sad that he'd ordered the wrong thing.

Would I go back? Of course! When you're that well taken care of, it doesn't matter if some of the dishes don't amaze. With fresh ingredients, and such excellent service, there's always the possibility of greatness."}
{"text":"To Luke s. who was whining that they wouldn't allow him to bring his baby stroller into a tiny one-room restaurant- get a damn babysitter!  Don't give low marks to a small place because u can't fit your babystroller in there!  How self-centered do you have to be?   The place is the size of my bedroom and you feel so entitled that you demand they allow your baby stroller in? As an aside, I think most of us on Yelp ignore low grades from reviewers with screaming babies/children.  If we want kid-friendly, we go to tim hortons (--end rant--)
Anyway, this place had excellent service.  It is rare when a waiter knows when not to intrude and when to ask if you'd like more wine.  The food was excellent.  But the price is unbelievable!  For a dinner of two, and 2 martini's a piece, the bill came to $245!   With tip that's a $300 meal.  I have never ever seen a price like that before.  I feel a little violated.  The food was quite excellent, but nothing is worth that much."}
{"text":"This is a very cozy and quaint place - great for an intimate dinner with friends (in the front room) or a date!  The staff are very friendly and the food is pretty good - I wouldn't say great, but pretty good!  I had the potato gnocchi with a tomato and basil sauce that was yummy!  We shared the cheese platter and the sardine platter, which were great choices!  There is an outside patio but it was way too cold the day we went.  Overall I would give it 3.5 Stars, but I am feeling generous (or perhaps glutinous from all the pasta) so I am rounding up!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian meals I've had in my life!  I'm so glad a friend recommended this restaurant while visiting Toronto two summers ago. 
We got a special \"tasting\" menu from the owner and chef who was very kind to a group of ladies.  We also ordered some additional meats to add to our order.
Every dish was perfectly seasoned with FRESH herbs and I could taste the freshness in the pastas as well.  We had some champagne with our dinner and the service was impeccable, our glasses were never empty.  Desserts were magnificent, out of the this world!  Who would've thought fresh cracked peppercorn over strawberry sorbet would be so good.  We had one of each dessert and each was so delicious, we were so full that I was about to burst.  I think I gained 5lbs just from this dining experience.
The restaurant itself is open and quaint.  It seemed like a classic restaurant setting in Italy, only in Canada."}
{"text":"Went for drinks in the newly opened bar area and was quite impressed.

Service was top notch. Everyone from the bartender to the bar manager and hostess were attentive and friendly and service was quick. The bar area is well appointed and cozy and there is an impressive glass walled wine cellar next to the bar.

Even when a mistake was made, they turned it into a positive. My date and I had not ordered a third beer but the bartender thought we had and brought it the table. When the mistake was realized, they immediately put the beer on the house. Awesome.

Only minus would be that they ask if you want regular or sparkling water, we chose the sparkling water and it costs $5.50 but they didn't tell us. Still okay as I expected it would cost and so I didn't ask, but for those unaware it should be stated. Not a big deal.

Great place and we're looking forward to returning for the food"}
{"text":"Noce is a gem of a restaurant that offers traditional Italian food with lots of flavor and flair. The stuffed olives, mushroom ravioli and veal gnocchi were all fantastic. Service and drinks were impeccable, and the atmosphere was perfect for a romantic evening. 

If you're looking for a great meal paired with amazing atmosphere and service, keep this place in mind."}
{"text":"I have noticed mixed reviews for this restaurant but I am happy to say mines was excellent both service and food. I went here for the Winterlicious menu with my friend and the first impression I had was it was very cosy and quaint. We were able to get to seated earlier then our reservation which was a definite plus, we both were quite hungry =P 

Tables were fairly close together and at that time the restaurant was fairly busy but noise level was not an issue. We were greeted and offered water, the server was very friendly and came by a few minutes after allowing us to browse the menu. We ordered the following:
Appetizers:
- Noce Salad, romaine hearts, Italian asiago, walnuts, pears, white wine, pommary, mustard dressing  
- Mozzarella di buffalo, cherry tomatoes, basil, olive oil

Entrees:
- Oven braised, black angus beef, short ribs, with chipolini onions, mushrooms, mashed potatoes and green beans
- Parpadelle with forest mushrooms, wild forest mushrooms, cream sauce, truffle oil and chives

Desserts:
- Tiramisu
- Chocolate Mousse

We enjoyed our food very much, there was a good combination of flavour in each dish we had. I really liked the dressing in the Noce Salad, it was distinctively different then your typical salad. The parpadelle was excellent, the cream sauce with truffle oil made the dish. The aroma itself was amazing. But the best part of the meal was the tiramisu and I usually am not a fan of desserts however this was amazing. It was very moist, flavourful and the perfect way to end a meal.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"I giving this restaurant 5 stars for the fresh and most deliciously prepared whole red snapper that I am still thinking about 1 week later. The staff was great, excellent waiter whose name I believe is Brice. My husband throughly enjoyed his steak as well. Great meal, dining experience. We were seated outside and weather was perfect. We will definitely go back for the fish when in Toronto. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant. I have been there twice now - last night for Valentine's day with my sweetheart included. Very romantic.

My bf claims they have the best veal in the city. I'll have to take his word for it as I don't eat meat but I do make the odd exception for a fish dish when I'm out and they make AMAZING fish dishes. Last night i started with sea scallops that were to die for - I took a picture it was beautiful and cooked perfectly, My bf had the raw tuna which also had a beautiful combination of flavours. For my main I had the black cod served over collard greens, white asparagus and a delicious citrus/sweet sauce that I could have licked off the plate. I actually finished my meal before my bf which is a first ever, he's sets records in speed! He took a picture for the proof I finished first :-)

For dessert we had tiramisu - traditional and delicious. Tough choice over the creme brulee but in an Italian place I had to go tiramisu. Perfect topping to the meal.

An extensive wine list/cellar glassed off of the back room would entice any oenophiles with any range of price point. 

The decor is white linen tablecloths and napkins, black and white dressed servers - all male as far as I could tell with excellent knowledge of the food and wine. Wonderful service - we were visited by several waiters in making sure our food was served when ready and our glasses topped up when necessary. They are attentive but not intrusive but happy to chat if you're engaging. The waiter we had the first time we went about a year ago was there and we made a point of saying hi and that he was one of the reasons we returned. 

It's not trendy or flashy but I love the traditional feel. Not sure why there are any bad reviews but I suppose I've only been twice and any restaurant can have a bad night. But I have nothing but wonderful memories here and look forward to plenty more."}
{"text":"Just recently started serving brunch .  My wife had a lovely prosecco cocktail.  The baked baked eggs were yummy.  I had pizza special.  Everything so good we will need to come back for dinner some time."}
{"text":"Pronto! Noce came recommended from a true Italian shoe guy at Browns. One can infer that Noce is the Manolo Blahnik of Toronto Italian restaurants: expensive, but justifiably classic and sexy. 

Although my date arrived under-dressed, everyone from the host to our waiter treated us with the utmost in charming hospitality. Note: dinner jacket recommended for the gents, while the ladies should just look sharp.

The herbs were so fresh and Italian, they took me back to being a backpacker in Florence. The scallops were happy discs of golden goodness, the mozarella was creamy, but the best was served last: the Italian cheesecake. Now if you are thinking that cheesecake is heavy and depressing, Italian cheesecake is simply not so! They use a ricotta so light and fluffy, you could use it as a pillow for sweet dreams. And instead of tasting cheesy, it's definitively lemon-zesty. 

$200 down, I have no regrets. 

Tip: for an ultra-romantic night, take an evening stroll through Trinity Bellwoods Park (kitty-corner from Noce) before heading over for dinner."}
{"text":"Noce is a lovely Italian restaurant in Trinity Bellwoods. I went for Winterlicious this year along with a few of my girlfriends for lunch. At $33, we got to choose from a curated menu of Italian delicacies. They have three rooms for you to dine and wine in: the Queen West Room, the Tuscany Room, and the Octopus Lounge. The Queen West Room is their main dining room, which was the room my friends and I were placed in. You get a nice view of Queen Street West and Trinity Bellwoods Park. The Tuscany Room is more of a relaxed atmosphere to get a bite and the Octopus Lounge allows you to unwind and socialize during late hours.

I thoroughly enjoyed each and every single dish I had at Noce! I ordered the Bufala Campana, B.C. Savoury Clams and Torta di Nocciola. I don't think you can go wrong with any of these dishes. The appetizer and entree were incredibly savoury so I highly recommend the Bufala Campana and B.C. Savoury Clams if you like savoury food. The Torta di Nocciola is perfect for someone who wants gelato with a crunch to their dessert as well. 

When I go for Italian food I typically order pasta or pizza because it's normally what I can afford on the menu. But with Noce's Winterlicious menu, I was able to venture out and try items I normally wouldn't get. I am glad to have had the opportunity to try Noce's diverse menu. Our waiter was not only charming but he made sure we were comfortable and provided excellent service. I highly recommend Noce to anyone who loves Italian cuisine or is looking for a nice place to eat lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5. food was decent (not amazing) but the service was AMAZING. From the moment we stepped inside the restaurant, we felt welcomed! Our server was hilarious and charming, and we got very great customer service throughout the whole night. The cocktails were great as well, we both got the \"Queen\" cocktail (first on the cocktail menu). I had the truffle ravioli and my gf had the gnocchi which I thought was better than my ravioli! I would come again try something different."}
{"text":"Great service and drinks. Wonderful location and great decor. Will certainly return for some steak."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY??

It's the season of winterlicious so why not give this restaurant a try during this event? I was intrigued by the selection in their winterlicious menu so I decided to give this restaurant a try. 

They have 3 different types of room with different ambiance so request a room you want to sit in at the time of your reservation. The queen room faces the street so this room may get the most light from outside. You can also have a view of queen street and trinity bellwoods park across the street. The Tuscany room is the second room and the octopus lounge is the area you will enter from to the restaurant. 

We had marinated cod and beef tartare to start. We couldn't decide on the appetizers because they all sounded like really great options! And we were amazed. The marination to the dishes were just right and didn't feel heavy, pairing with the crostini was just right! 

We had rib eye steak and salmon as the main course. I loved the rib eye steak. I thought it was a great portion size for the price we paid and it was grilled to our liking at medium rare. The salmon was alright. I didn't think it was that spectacular and it was on the dry side for me. The flavor to the salmon didn't stand out to me much. 

For dessert, I also couldn't decide because all of the options sounded great!! We ended up with the first two on the list and we enjoyed it. The chocolate cake that came with Nutella ice cream can be on the bitter side so don't just finish all the ice cream first before you finish the cake! 

LAST TIP?!

It seems like this restaurant is a hidden gem as not a lot of ppl talk about this restaurant during the winterlicious event but I have to say, this restaurant was a great pick. Make your reservations early and request to sit in a certain room to get the best ecperience"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from Noce and I'm sad I've only just recently discovered this gem. Everything about this place is fantastic, the bar, the ambience, the food, the staff, the patio. It's such a lovely restaurant to spend an evening, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food is notably overpriced. The beef carpaccio was fabulous as well as the mushroom stuffed ravioli in a truffled butter. The sea bass wasn't very impressive at all and the potato and spinach along side it was even more bland. The ambiance is nice, quiet and romantic but I couldn't help but notice an arrogance in the air. I quickly found the arrogance comical as I realized it was their price list and not their food that was being showcased. Not coming back"}
