{"text":"I must admit I was hesitant to try yet another Chinese restaurant. I have been so disappointed lately I hadn't eaten it in 2 yrs!!
Then I found this hidden gem, now I get it at least once a month!!!
This is a truly authentic tasting place and you get the best of both the Chinese and Thai food worlds. 
The price is great and so are all the deals!
Please try it out
For great food and service !!! Xo"}
{"text":"If you like garlic in your Chinese food, this is your place. Everything tastes like garlic, from the spring rolls to the noodles. Definitely for takeout or delivery only, as they do not have glasses for drinks or bowls for soup. No hot tea, either. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to try it out, and tried out the thai food options as well. Was not a fan, felt sick afterwards. Could of been a one time bad experience, but would rather stick to \"the great wall\" or \"china garden\" right down the street."}
{"text":"We ordered Beef Chow Mein, but it doesn't come with Chow Mein (noodle)! The owner said the bean sprout is the noodle?!?!
I've never been to a place and ordered beef chow Mein without the actual Mein!
Rice was ok but if you want noodles beware and make sure you get it! Lol"}
{"text":"Family of four and we all love it. Best in Bradford"}
{"text":"Since the place has changed owners I'm glad to give this place 5 stars. Food is actually really good here compared to the other Asian restaurants in town!
Previous owners were very inconsistent and I once found a staple in my food, I had chicken fried rice and it was not throughly cooked.

New owners I have gone to see numerous times now and have been consistent, delicious, and very nice people! Don't need to go anywhere else"}
