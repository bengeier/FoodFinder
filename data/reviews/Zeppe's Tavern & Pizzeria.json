{"text":"Outstanding food, good price point. There are times the service is pretty slow but overall great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"They took my order last night but never delivered it. Then didn't answer when I called back to find out where it was.  I wish I could give negative stars to this place."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar inside, the wait wasn't to long for my food and I was by myself. I ordered a drink then food and started to smell cigarette smoke. Outside about 8 feet from the so called AIR WALL LOL, was one women smoking. No one asked me if I wanted another drink but I did get a glass of water after choking on the smoke. Still no offer for another drink, although the guy next to me got asked by both bartenders. As I left I asked the bartender do you always allow smoking in the bar he said they are outside and we checked it out and the AIR WALL protects it. I said then why do I smell it and its not 30 feet from the opening, then he patronized me guess I won't be back. And will get a hold of Ohio Smoke Free."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. In town for a wedding, had no idea where to eat with 3 hungry small children and happened upon Zeppes. Everything on the menu looked amazing and when the food came we were not disappointed. We thoroughly enjoyed the pizza, sandwiches, chili cheese fries, spaghetti and meatballs, as well as our Caesar salads. People consider me a harsh restaurant critic, but I found nothing to complain about and our server Evan was fantastic. The only problem I had was there was too much incredible looking food on the menu which made for a tough decision. Thanks Zeppes"}
{"text":"well far as the food, its good for a Sunday. Wait staff a little on the slow side."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for quite some time and I was never flipped over the service or food. HOWEVER, tonight I had the beef medallions and they were amazing. We love the patio too, so we'll be back."}
{"text":"For some reason they can never get my order of food right. Been going there for a while an only had my food right twice out of like a hundred times."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had! This place should have more stars on its current review. Its clean, updated and a fun place to hang out in addition to the good food."}
{"text":"My burger was burnt and it took forever to get my food. After smelling cigarette smoke for an hour while waiting for my burnt food I decided to give this restaurant a 1 star"}
{"text":"Happening patio. Stephie, the new waitress did a great job.  The martini was perfect, large and strong enough for a little buzz.  Buffalo dip was good.  Say medium on the menu, I'm a bit of a wimp, so a bit hot for me.  Great flavor though. Ordered the Meatball, pepperoni and parmesan pizza .  The ricotta was a great touch.  The sauce is chunky, but tasty.  Picked the chunks out.  The crust was really good, nice crispy edges.   Pasquales still tops it overall, but the ricotta & crust gets it some bonus points.  (Fyi-Patio was loud and smoking allowed.  It didn't bother me, but I wouldn't advise for children- sit inside"}
{"text":"The food is not fancy but  is consistently  good.  Music and crowd is 70s.  Friendly service and great patio in nice weather.. MC Parking outside the rear entrance.  See you there."}
{"text":"One of the best places to meet friends in Newbury. Beautiful building, awesome outdoor patio with fireplace, and great food. Full bar and friendly staff."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  I had the chicken piccata. It was fabulous. Included pasta, a salad. And an additional side for $14.99.  A real bargain because it was lemony and delicious.  My husband had the Cobb salad and it actually looked like the picture.  We went to hear the band the recyclers.  Good band!   We will return!!!!  People around us had the pizza which looked fabulous"}
{"text":"Nice wait staff but food is meh. Burnt to a crisp burger, lasagna was watery and not very flavorful. Don't think we will return."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 since the place was built, extremely inconsistent each time. The wait staff seems untrained, or unable to visit your table somewhat consistently. Each time we have ordered drinks, they have been horribly poured. I would say the food is moderately tolerable, when they serve what you asked for. I would generally only recommend pick up here, definitely not on their game within the restaurant."}
{"text":"Zeppe's bedford heights use to be good we ordered there all the time cause the meals where fresh and hot tonight I went and bought a dinner and anybody that can't make linguine  and meatballs needs not to work in a Italian restaurant. The manager made me feel real uncomfortable buying from zeppe's tonight \"Food is only as good as the person are people fixing it...and there is no love in this pasta and meatball dinner...So I say to Zeppe's of Bedford Heights you need a new cook and manager."}
{"text":"My family and I made our second visit to Zeppe's Tavern and once again, the service and food were excellent!  The portions are great for the price - and even the kid's meals are plentiful!  Plus - kids eat free with adult purchases on Tuesdays!  The appetizers we had were delicious: chicken quesadilla and bruschetta (which is my son's favorite).  We always have food to bring home because the servings are generous.  That, topped with super friendly and attentive service puts this Tavern high on my list of recommendations."}
{"text":"We been here a few times and will keep coming back. Great atmosphere, great calzones, and a great Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Everything had been great from this location. Zeppes other location in Middlefield is a different story. But this one in Newbury is good. The zeppes calzone is yummy. Their pizza is pretty darn good and the wings are full of flavor and huge. They also have an awesome outdoor bar that had live music in the summer. The wife and I really like this place."}
{"text":"Great pizza excellent salads!  Oh my gosh I had no idea this place was so great.  My husband has come here several time (so he just admitted to me tonight ). The menu is extensive the food so fresh and great quality.  Did I say quantity?  Yes that too!"}
{"text":"Disappointed!  My second visit.  They wouldn't accept my restaurant.com certificate. I was told that,  as soon as I showed it on my arrival. That was appreciated. Thanks to the busy but cordial bartender.        The PBR was cold and reasonably priced., They also have a good selection of beer, wine and liquor.       They no longer offer a pizza that is smaller then 8 pieces and  $10.99. The pizza is marginal, the blend of cheese they use is bland and the crust and sauce uninspiring.  The hot  wings were soggy? I understand this on take out but on eat in its pitiful.       I WAS excited about this place.  I felt comfortable going out, sitting at the bar and having a beer  by myself. I was willing to overlook the food quality for atmosphere. The place is nice with a great patio. I love being able to look outside if its hot or be outside if its nice. They also have entertainment on certain night of the week.        Its not very friendly for a single person,  a symptom of management I assume. The manager stalked by on many occasions, with no apparent destination except maybe to  have a smoke? Where has connecting with your patrons gone? This is small town USA and it the lack of warmth is sad.       Not planning on going back.   I cant get it to make sense any more. $26 for pizza a beer and wings for just myself doesn't work.       Friends also went last evening. They also experienced a lack of warmth. They were uncharged for  items without being warned it would be an upcharge.  They are also crossing this place off their list.       There is better food for less in the neighborhood. If you just want to party this may be your pick."}
{"text":"First time coming to zeppes and specifically this location. Really nice place with a covered outdoor eating area. Food and service we excellent. The owner came out and asked us how everything was. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Something's up at Zeppe's. I would consider myself a regular, which means I go at least four times a month. I was never really a fan of the food, but you could always count on the bartenders being good. There were 3 or 4 good bartenders that disappeared all of a sudden. Not sure if they opened a new Zeppe's and sent them there, but whatever the reason was, the replacements are average at best. I observe a lot when I'm sitting at a bar and none of these new bartenders makes eye contact with anyone sitting at the bar. I went in the other day - bar was half-full and they had three bartenders... it took me about 10 minutes to get a drink and that was because I finally flagged one of them down. My food order showed up cold the other day because the guy that took my order disappeared smoking. They also seem to spend tons of time at the cash register - like they're writing \"War & Peace\". I like this place and want it to be successful, but the way it has been managed lately is really lacking."}
{"text":"Bike Night is awesome. Food is really good. Service is pretty good too. Pizza is the best. Live bands.  Servers are all hott also...."}
{"text":"I was a little bit wary about going into a restaurant owned by Zeppe's since all I associated the name with was pizza; I was pleasantly surprised.  Walking in, it looked like a typical sports bar, but was clean and nicely lit.  My boyfriend and I started out with the \"zepperoni rolls\" which were hot and filled to bursting with melted cheese and pepperoni (yum!).  I ordered the buffalo chicken Alfredo for my entree which was an interesting combination but it made my taste buds happy.  The sauce was creamy and there was a little kick to the chicken that nicely rounded out the flavors.  Our waitress brought fresh baked garlic sticks to go with the pasta which I could tell literally just came out of the oven... The portions were huge that I got to take 1/2 of my meal home in addition to the garlic twists and some of the pepperoni rolls.  Bill took home half of his chicken teriyaki too.  I definitely will be coming back here"}
{"text":"I don't get,why people go here. At best you  eat typical cheap thick pizza. Nothing good about it.seevice is below par. Go across street much better food and service"}
{"text":"Pretty good. As for delivery they are very friendly and prompt. Sometimes the pizza is undercooked though. As for dine-in great atmosphere I love the live music and huge booths lol food is very good"}
{"text":"The food is good and the staff is usually friendly. It's nice to go here in the summer and have a drink on the patio. They have bike night and bands. Zeppes is the place to be in newbury in the summer!"}
{"text":"Too many teenie-boopers working (oops, I mean receiving a paycheck for physically standing there) who make it abundantly clear they would rather be somewhere else and the sleezy managers who tolerate it to look \"cool\" to the female staff, I was beginning to think this was a real life production of the movie 'Waiting...\" I counted no fewer than 16 workers walking through the dining area during our hour-long stay there.  And really, none of that should bother me... especially watching all those super-stretchy yoga pants or super-high tight mini skirts... but listening to that \"she said, he said\" drama for an hour sorta gnaws at the dining experience.  It certainly didn't help speed up the order of grilled pork chops from getting to the table 30 minutes after the order went in.  Front of house manager said they wanted to make sure it was cooked thoroughly due to its thickness.  *Looking around*  Hmmm, a handful of patrons, a huge staff in the back, pork chops, and a half hour???  Sure, OK...  Opened in 2011, this place is one of Zeppe's latest forays into the tavern world having expanded their pizza empire of 30+ shops throughout northeast Ohio.  And while I applaud entrepreneurship and competition, why would you open your 30-something-ith store - and the only Zeppe's or other pizza store for at least 5 miles - directly across from the long-running, family-owned local pizza/Italian restaurant Mangia Mangia which had been there for many years?  And while I'm not a fan of Mangia Mangia, this certainly wasn't a shout-out for business ethics, fair business practices, or just for being a good business neighbor on Zeppe's part!  This was our second visit, our first having been a carry out order from their takeout side. Probably won't be back.  I can (and do) make better pizzas at home and Geauga Farms Country Meats has better pork chops that I can grill in far less than half an hour!"}
{"text":"The food is above average for a pizza joint and their pizza is my favorite around, love Zeppes . Went here to watch the cavs in the finals and they scheduled a classic rock band on the patio on the same night. No big deal right just turn up the game inside.... NO, there was no sound for the game entirely! When I asked if they could turn up the game for my table I was told it was impossible because it goes through their jukebox. The band took a 30 minute break and I was still refused sound. I asked for any kind of compensation as we came there to watch the game and I was refused again... oh and waited 20 minutes for a drink... HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT, won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 dozen wings. BBQ and the honey gold. Both very good. Also the provolone wedges were great. Only thing I disliked was the fact that there was buffalo sauce in with my honey gold wings. It ruined them. They must mix in the same bowl without cleaning. If it was in bbq ones I wouldn't have minded as much."}
{"text":"Love Zeppe's Tavern. It's not your \"typical\" hangout, because the food is SO MUCH BETTER! Great place to meet friends or date night. Caprese Pesto Pizza, ummm - yes, more please!"}
{"text":"Just scheduled a retirement party for a employee in our department that was retiring a section of the patio was reserved for us I had placed an order for pizza and wings  that were prepared and placed out in the patio just before people arrived for the party the service was great Gale one of the hostesses made us feel very comfortable and provided us with great service and everyone said the pizza and wings were awesome people who had never been at Zeppe s we're quite impressed and thanks again to Mike  the manager at Zeppe s who setup and took our reservations for the party Great job!!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place.  We stop here everytime we are here on business and have never had an issue.   Staff has always been great and food fantastic.   Today the bartender was the worst employee ever.  She was more interested in talking with her buddies and regular customer then taking care of anybody else that is not in her circle of friends.  Don't think we will be back.  It's sad that Zeppe's would even employ anybody like her."}
{"text":"We were out in newbury today helping my in laws renovate their new house.   We decided to pick up some pizza's for everyone. A deluxe and a 3 topping pizza.  I've gotta say, we weren't really that impressed with it.  The crust seemed under cooked, not enough sauce, or cheese and the toppings were just meh.  We were kind of hoping for something better. But. We ate it because we've been working like dogs all day. Will we order again? I doubt it. Just too meh."}
{"text":"First and last time here. Food was AWFUL!  Chicken Fingers-large portion, however, tasted like a spicy pancake batter and the outside was burnt and the inside was not fully cooked and the breading was soggy. Very soggy.  Provolone Wedges-cold, cheese was like a rubber band. had to chew one bite for several minutes.  Garlic Twists-cold, hard, not a single taste of garlic.  Onion rings-not horrible but the grease they were fried in must have been from a county fair a year ago. Again, kinda burnt on the outside, but soggy and not fully cooked on the inside.  Wings-asked for extra crispy. They were tiny and slimy.  Just all around awful. You are better off getting food at a bad dive bar. this was a complete waste of $40."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!! Crust is very good and ingredients fresh. The bar area is nice, friendly crowd and good drink specials. Fried fish is very good, subs and wings are the bomb."}
{"text":"They are lucky to get the one star. Tried delivery twice. First time pizza came undone in the center, to the point it was raw dough. This was after waiting two hours and three phone calls. Second time, pizza was barely done but more than an hour late. Fast forward three months. Tried dine in, ordered cheese ravioli. I figured it would be thaw and boil, how could they mess that up right? Wrong. Still frozen in the centers. I ate the two that were room temperature. When waitress came to clear the plates (it was her first time back to the table), she asked me didn't I like them, I told her they were still frozen. Really? She said as she glared at the frozen raviolis, as if it were their fault. Sorry, gave you three chances, which was two more than you deserved."}
{"text":"The meatball pepperoni parmesan pizza was okay but had a bitter aftertaste.  Too much Parmesan cheese?  I think they could just skip the parm or go lighter on it and it would have been fine.  Decent pepperoni and meatball toppings and not too sweet sauce. The Cajun dry rub wings were crispy and with a nice amount of seasoning. The garden salad was your typical one.  Boiled egg on the side with some croutons and olives. Not too much to this location as it is a take out place.  A tidy waiting area with a few chairs and a bench.  The pick up experience could have been, I wish, better. I told the person helping me my name and he proceed to ring up my bill. He presented me with my receipt and walked away to the kitchen area as I was signing it. He comes back out 10 minutes later and asks me if I've been helped. He completely forgot about me. The place was not busy. After telling him my name again and what was in my order he puts it all together. All my food was sitting on their unheated counter the whole time. He hands me my food and says \"I got side tracked.\"   Thanks Zeppe's for the lukewarm pizza and wings and forgetting about me at the counter.  I was the only customer standing in the waiting area. The barely warm food I can deal with.  Hoping this is a one off poor experience."}
{"text":"We have done take out at this location about 5 times total. Each time, the pizza has arrived a bit cold. Hey are pretty over priced but the pizza isn't bad.   The reason for the three stars is the low heat level when pizza arrives and the price. However, if we were to dine in, I'm sure the pizza temperature wouldn't be a problem.   If you just need a pizza for a night in, this place isn't bad. It is definitely better than most chains. However, be ready to wait a bit for the pizza to arrive. We waited an hour this past weekend."}
{"text":"The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's always jam packed pull of people. But that's because it's good and there isn't much competition around. The food is good, the servers are friendly, and it has a good atmosphere. I really like having a place to go in Newbury besides Mangias."}
{"text":"If you like poor service and overpriced food this is the place for you! We used to come here regularly after work but I declare this will be the final visit. Our table of 9, one of two parties at the tavern, were asked to quiet down.  Fortunately we can now sit quietly and enjoy the awful music."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim.. food was decent.. I got a chef salad it came with a side of garlic bread. I don't eat gluten but I did have a bite to just \"taste test \" they were nothing special at all. Hardly could taste the buttery garlic!  My husband said his burger was a delicious pile of grease .. haha at least he said it was good!  Our server was friendly and all of our food came out exactly as we ordered. It took a little bit too long for her to cash us out . She kept passing by our table with out credit card right in front her. That was a tad bit annoying."}
{"text":"I ordered what  was supposed to be Lake Erie perch, It looked and tasted like ocean perch. The service is pretty good food is average at best."}
{"text":"This review is based on purchases of the Pizza both in house and carryout, I find that Zeppes Pizza orders are VERY INCONSISTENT, I've purchased them usually during a busy time period such as Friday or Saturday's around 4:30pm to 7pm and no 2 pizzas are the same regardless of the amount of toppings. One time the sauce will be perfect the next it may be to sweet or to sour, yet another may be loose and another goopy and dry.  The sausage is a toss up if you order something like sweet sausage hold on cause many times it may be HOT sausage. Pepperoni pizza's are extremely over seasoned HOT even for pepperoni get those tums out...  One thing I all so find they like to BURN the pizza ... Why? who knows, you can tell them \"cook it lightly\" and \"don't burn the crust\" and sure as the sun will rise it will come out BURNT and dry. Zeppes used to have a good pizza but today I think its all about the push and not the great product.  this last pizza I ordered was burnt dried and nothing I would of wanted, If i knew I was going to get this kind of poor quality I would of just went to dominos...or pizza pizza,, ....because this is where this place is heading if the don't take charge in the kitchen  Management need to supervise the kitchen for quality not production or soon customers will leave and go down the street like I am now gong to do."}
{"text":"Love the 70s classic rock, have never had a bad meal. Love the perch sub or dinner. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great pizza and new patio.  Enjoyed a lazy sunday night there.  Hopefully they have a better atmosphere other nights - the crowd seemed somewhat young (crowd = 3 other people), although our bartender / waitress was awesome and very sweet!"}
