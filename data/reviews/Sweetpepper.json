{"text":"Stopped in for a veal sammich.  It was nothing spectacular.  Around $10 for sammich, fries and a coke.  The veal was nicely breaded but a little on the small size.  The bun was fresh and too big for the amount of veal.  They should either add more meat or have buns that are smaller.

This place is strictly a pick up and go place and the only seating is counter top facing the windows.  In the summer, I noticed they have chairs out so it might be a nice place to enjoy the summer sun while having lunch.

It's close to work so it gets a passing grade but it's not some place I'd go out of my way to pick up food."}

{"text":"Sweetpepper is one of the lunch spots on Bay mainly frequented by 9-5ers that work in the area. The space is fairly small, but if you'd like to stay and eat there is one small table, and some barstool seating along the window.

I usually pop by Sweetpepper when I am craving a greek chicken salad. While the salad is by no means fancy, the dressing is pretty delicious, the chicken is well seasoned, and the salad has an abundance of olives which, for me, is always a plus. I've had a few items on the menu and while nothing has really wowed me (and whenever I get fries they are overcooked,) they do have a nice selection, in addition to daily specials. 

I do find that it is a bit pricey here, but is a good alternative to the standard take-out that is in the area. Not to mention the customer service is top notch, too. Everytime I come here I am welcomed with a smile and the people that work here are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"A tiny take-away joint opposite the big government buildings on Bay Street, Sweet Pepper is frequented by...well...I don't know; I occasionally see people noshing at the lunch counter, but generally the place is empty. 

Not for want of advertising, mind you. Large signs offer an array of classic Italian sangwiches. You know, the kind that start with the word \"breaded\" and end with your choice of additional toppings for 50 cents. Other options include deli sandwiches (picture Tony Soprano saying \"Gobbagoo\"), salads, soups and french (Italian?) fries. 

Apparently they also sell pastas, and meatballs and such. 

Most people spend only as long as it takes to order; then rush off to parts unknown with small foil footballs. 

A brave soul, I once ordered their \"new\" eggplant Parmiggiana. It's \"new\" since the store opened, and tasted of the same vintage. A watery, oily mess, it laid waste to the kaiser that held it; semi-solid eggplant in soggy breading, doused in a thin sauce that tasted mostly of salt, with a side of sugar. Complimentary peppers and onions offered minimal texture. 

Saved from a one star review by it's proximity to Starbucks, where I consumed it along with a delicious, strong cup of coffee. 

Proof that good coffee saves all."}
