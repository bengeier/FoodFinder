{"text":"This is a money pit. If your young, dumb, and have money to piss away this is the place for you. This is piano karaoke of the worst kind. Save your cash and go to a pub with a good band. Better food. Better service. Can't believe I wasted two hours of my life there!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night, never having heard of this place and was kind of sceptical but my friends were all saying it was a hoot... and boy, were they right! Such a fun time! The duelling pianos were awesome and the whole atmosphere was incredible. You can put in requests for a song you want to be played and they encourage you to tip with your request but we requested Bohemian Rhapsody three times without tip and they FINALLY played it near the end of the night. I think they just played it because they were sick of us bitching about wanting to hear it lol. It took a long time for them to finally play it but when they did, it was well worth the wait. Everyone, and I do mean everyone was up on the table dancing and belting it out at the top of their lungs! The piano players were seriously perfect at singing every single song. They played alllll the classics and everyone sang along the whole night. Dancing on the tables is such a fun time! You can also go dance on the little stage where they play but its so small that only a few people can go up at a time but if you get a chance, I definitely recommend because it's a blast. The drinks were a little expensive but it is a piano bar and you need a reservation in order to get in so expect to pay quite a bit more for drinks and food. We never had any food but from what I saw, it looked delicious. I will definitely be going back! Highly, highly recommend this place for a night out with friends :)"}
{"text":"Aussie Rules can get wild on weekends as women take to table tops to clap their hands and stomp their feet to live music provided by the dueling pianists. You usually have to call a week or more in advance for reservations to the place. It's become quite popular with just about every age group and the place fills with cheers and laughter as the guys hit the keys.
It's a lively, high energy show. The guys (three pianists actually, who don't really duel but work in shifts) keep the energy flowing all night long as they cut though standard piano classics and even try other things like metal and rap on the piano. A big part of the show is taking requests and that gets everybody into it. The guys capture a strange vibe in this place through live music that you usually never experience in a bar setting.
No idea why they call it Aussie Rules; the menu is confused about its nationality and the pianists have nothing to do with Australia. The acoustics in the large room are terrible, but it somehow adds to the party atmosphere. Somehow they pump it up and keep the music sounding amazing.
This is a great place to take someone from out of town or if you haven't been, take yourself. If you like live music and a good show, this is the place."}
{"text":"Cheesy yet irresistibly fun spot for their dueling pianos. I guarantee you'll be dancing on your chair or the table by the end of the night if not sooner. Service is definitely geared towards larger groups drinking jugs of beer...if you're not a beer drinker you might want to order your drinks in multiples so you don't run dry."}
{"text":"Had much more fun here than I was expecting. Dueling pianos was a blast, they played our requests. Food was okay, drinks were great. Service quality was 8 out of 10. We will be going back. Easy parking."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" is not really the right phrase for it. I have never been in this kind of atmosphere before, and that was the only real fun part of the night, besides being with the people I was there with.
We got there at 7, the place was dead as the \"show\" doesn't start til 9. Not a problem, except we still didn't get a lot of attention from the wait staff. The food was purely mediocre (we all had different things and none of us were very impressed) but it was cheap enough.
The drinks were insanely priced and barely worth it as they were weak as shit. $12 for martini's is nuts.
The dueling pianos was different. I mean the guys are great but the place put me off a lot. For instance they ask for a \"gratuity\" to play your requested song, but they certainly made a big deal about the people who tipped highest. That isn't very impressive for me since you pay a cover price and a lot for drinks and food (5 of us cost $170) If you're there long enough then you'll get the joy of experiencing the same show twice. Yay!
The atmosphere is surely fun and energetic, but I feel like you'd have to be in a superb mood to enjoy it as I just found it very loud, and I was irritated there was nowhere to get up and dance."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to come here for a birthday ! Never in my life have I been so rudely treated at the door. We were waiting at the door for a few minutes and with absolutely no-one to greeting us or directing us we decided to walk in. The long bearded bouncer at the door stops me in my way in says \" you can't just walk in, that's not how it works you have to wait in line \" FYI there was no line we were the first in line . I was horrified at the absolute arrogance and rudeness of this bouncer to the point that I thought he was being sarcastic but he was not. We asked what line he was talking about and he said pointing right in front of us \"this line\". Needless to say we did not stay to pay for our 12$ cover or go inside. Please don't go to this establishment if you are looking for pleasant customer service . I also need to mention that the manager said \"I'm sorry \" nothing else ... Very very disappointed at this entire experience . Will NEVER go back !!"}
{"text":"Food: Pricey and underwhelming. Bad and uncharacteristic even by most bar standards.
Price: 6.75 for a bottle of beer? 6.50 for a pint of regular domestic on tap? These are outrageous prices. And don't forget the 11$ cover charge.
Entertainment: You'll have fun. The pianists are amazing and the crowds always liven up the experience.
Serving: Either not enough servers or they're terrible. I can't figure out which. Waiting 30 minutes for a drink to arrive is not acceptable. Awfully rude servers and door staff too!"}
{"text":"Entertainment: 8/10
Food: 6/10
Service: 2/10

This is a fun place for a large group, but keep your expectations LOW re: food and service. Half the chips on our nacho platter were crushed; meatballs on the pasta dish seemed to be lots of filler with very little meat. We asked our server about an item that was on the feature board, and she said she couldn't tell us anything about it because she had been on vacation when the kitchen introduced it. 

Eat somewhere else before you go, take a bunch of friends, and you'll enjoy Aussie Rules!"}
{"text":"Had a really great time here.  Arrived with no idea what to expect and spent 3-4 hours dancing, singing and eating some really great food.
 Strongly recommend the Beef Dip (might be the best beef dip I've ever had) and the nachos were pretty darn good as well."}
{"text":"Yes, it's cheesy and no, the food isn't the greatest BUT Aussie Rules is still a great time. Dueling pianos playing your favorite hits from the 80's and 90's. Everyone is singing along & enjoying themselves. I always forget how much fun it is until someone plans a night out there. Always a great time."}
{"text":"After my experience at Jubilations, I didn't want the evening to end, so I wandered over to Aussie Rules. And boy, does it ever!

Duelling pianists, dancing, good food, great vibe, high-energy crowd, cheap cover ($9) and fun people; How can all that NOT make for a good time?"}
{"text":"Been here twice, and had a blast both times!

Its basically a bar with two pianos and dueling pianists! They take song requests, and as the evening progresses, the crowd gets rowdier, the pianist get crazier, and people end up dancing on the tabletops, on the stage, and everywhere in between. 

The drinks are good, but the food is a bit pricey. But who cares really, when you're having such a great time anyway?"}
{"text":"Aussie fucking rules my friends.  Bryce the bartender and his two henchmen mark and Tyler they were absolutely unparalleled in what they do. They took everyone's orders and dealt them outs like they were yesterday's lunch orders.  Especially Bryce the way he handles these guys as though they are a team of sled dogs they perform technical work at a high speed level. They have my full attention and wil always for the next couple weeks."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times
Once I done drank to much so I cant give an accurate account of the night
Second I was the DD for a large party and that was ok, I really enjoyed the dueling Pianos, which is the whole point of the bar. 
But last night a small group of us went for Karaoke and we had a \"hoot and a Holler\" (thats what the cool kids call it right?) Anyway, Tony is the best Bartender ever, even if her opinion on grilled cheese and tomato soup or alphagetti is wrong. Tomato soup is the right answer if your wondering.
Anyway she really made us feel like we where just hanging out at a buddies house drinking while we waited for Karaoke started and that above everything else would make me recommend this place to anyone who wants a fun place to tie off a few"}
{"text":"If swaying drunkenly back and forth with your friends while loudly belting out Bennie and the Jets to a pair of hilarious piano players sounds like a good time, (and it should because it really, really is!) Look no further that Aussie Rules!

It's not the kind of bar you go to for a quick beer, and it's not a local watering hole.  It's a place to have fun with your friends in an all inclusive sing-along good time.

It's a fun place for people young and old... and that seems to be exactly who goes here, with no middle ground! Huge amounts 18-23 year olds and then a large 50+ crowd to boot.  I don't think it matters your age - Aussie Rules is an all inclusive, conducted karaoke good time.

The piano players will let you bribe them to play any song you want and they'll let other people bribe them even more to shut them up.  A gorgeously melodic rendition of \"What Does The Fox Say\" was tragically cut short due to an out bid.

The food - well, yes, they have food. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not why you're here.

The drinks - same as the food! But they are boozy and they get you in singin' and dancin' shap in no time!

What Aussie Rules review would be complete without an AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE? OI OI OI!"}
{"text":"I love this place and have been a number of times over the last several years. 

If you want a party here within reasonable distance to the stage,  you will need to book VERY far in advance.  6 months?  you still might not be the first people booking...  This place is full of parties from birthdays, graduations, bachelorette or whatever else requires people get a little bit crazy.   It's interesting how 18th and 60th birthdays can be held in the same place while everyone has a total blast. 

People will tell you that you'll end up standing on your chair and singing at the top of your lungs.... don't believe them?   We'll see ;)   Even my shiest and most stick-in-the-mud party attendees eventually gave in and got loose a bit there.   If you're already planning to be up there dancing away, wear fun accessories if you're celebrating because you'll probably get a chance to show off a bit more on stage. 

What my slightly younger self did to win a pitcher of beer is not for discussing here... but I can say you'll have a great time and you might end up a bit outside of your comfort zone.

If you're not planning on tipping with your song requests, you probably won't hear them.  What has disappointed me in the past is putting a song up there with a $10 and not even getting to hear it.  Did it fall off or the money ended up with another song?  I can't imagine the going rate for songs cost over $10....  oh well those musicians deserve that $10 even without getting my song. 

I wouldn't eat here - it's palatable but too expensive for what you get.  Ultimately we end up getting something to absorb alcohol  but it's not a great place for culinary delights.  Alcohol in here is expensive but I like their menu of mixed drinks and martinis and given the entertainment value and still reasonable cover I can forgive the price for a drink."}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette party, and what an amazing time! We were there during dueling pianos, and this is one of the best nights out I have had in years. The place was packed, with everyone dancing on chairs, booths, basically wherever there was space. Everyone was super friendly, and even towards the end of the evening, when everyone was tipsy, there was not one fight or cross word said, that I saw. Just a huge room full of people sharing a good time.

The only reason I knocked a star off is because I thought the food could have been better. The crab dip tasted like straight up Tabasco, and the mini Yorkshire puddings were a bit on the bland side. 

I will absolutely be back next time I am in Calgary, but will probably eat somewhere else before I head over."}
{"text":"Went for my friends birthday.

When my friend first told me that this is where we were going, I was a bit confused by the concept, but whatever. So off we went.

Firstly, reservations appear to be a must. My friend smartly had one and we had to get there at 6:30 even though the pianos only started at 9:00. There's an $11 cover charge which kind of sucks but it's a business.

We started off by eating. I had both the potato skins and the deep fried pickles. The potato skins weren't anything to write home about but the pickles were pretty good.

For drinks, just buy the pail thing that they offer which is a shooter and another drink and a bunch of ice because the money to size ratio is pretty good. Plus it looks pretty awesome when your entire table has them. I got asked twice what was up with our pails by various people.

The pianos were AMAZING. Our group tipped $50 (pooled together) and we handed them a stack of at least 10 songs. We therefore were treated to a medley that consisted of  the Spiderman theme, Shake it Off, Stop from the Spice Girls, Wrecking Ball and Paradise City and it strangely worked. The piano players are on their game and I don't think there isn't a song they couldn't do. We also tipped for Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins and ended up with the entire soundtrack from Top Gun. It was pretty fun just to have a drink (or pail or two) and sing obnoxiously loud at the top of your lungs. They have you get up and stand on your chairs as the night goes on so be warned for that. Everyone was so into it and was having a great time.

Our server Megan was also amazing. I haven't been to a restaurant where they take the time to learn your name and then call you by it the entire time.

The only problem was that it was SO expensive. I spent over $100 inbetween food, drinks and tipping.

Tipping will make sure your song gets played, but I think they play the others too."}
{"text":"this is a fun place! dueling pianos, requests, spontaneous line dancing to cadillac ranch, impromptu katy perry sing-a-longs this place is a lot of fun.

came here with a group of 9, we all met while on vacation in Australia and decided this was going to be our reunion spot. The food was alright, nothing really stood out as amazing. you've got your traditional north american pub fare. We were totally stoked at the fact they had Toohey's beer and Bundaberg Rum.

We binged drink cans of Toohey's New while down under, so that was what were looking for. Unfortunately they only had bottles of Toohey's Extra Dry. We weren't picky, had a great time anyway."}
{"text":"Awesome place where you can have fun while sharing a meal and drinks and listening to live music.
There are two pianos and three or more players... so they alternate and take brakes to keep you entertained.
They welcome all song requests and will sing most of them, well probably not most of them since they can get lots of requests... but they will sing lots...
It is a very fun place to go and have a great time!"}
{"text":"Met up with some girlfriends here not too long ago for some birthday beverages.  Because there is a cover charge make sure you plan on staying for a while ;).

Back in my Vancouver days in the early 90's we used to frequent a place in Gastown called O'Ryan's Piano Bar.  It was so much fun we went every weekend to dance and sing to the duelling piano's. You could also spend extra money on their special drinks (ie hurricanes) and you got to take the glasses home.  I used to have quite a collection of O'Ryans glasses...now I have only one left.  Eventually O'Ryan's disappeared from Vancouver but I was able to enjoy some duelling piano's when we visited New Orleans.

I was very excited when the girls wanted to go to a duelling piano bar in Calgary (I kind of went in with high expectations) and it delivered.  We shared a few appy's (Chook Wings, Chips and Dead Horse and Nacho's).  The food was ok but like my O'Ryan's days the most fun for me was singing and dancing to the duelling piano's.  Good Times!"}
{"text":"Yay!! Aussie Rules is SO much fun. I've only been here once before for a friend's birthday, and I did not know what to expect. \"Dueling Piano bar? That sounds weird\". UMMM, how about the most fun time ever. Lost my voice after that night. People really DO dance on the tables! Can't wait to go back. Did I mention how FUN it is? =)"}
{"text":"O la la we had so much fun here when we came down to hang in Calgary for the weekend! I had no idea this place existed but man is it fun.... but soooo expensive! Cover was $11 per person which kind of turned me off the place but once we were in I loved that there were duelling pianos! On top of that they were playing great songs that everyone knew, there were people dancing on tables and having a great time. Somehow we ended up with $16 drinks.. and by drinks I mean pales filled with alcohol in front of us that went down way too easy.

I would definitely come to a place like this again, I just love singing-along to all the all the great songs!"}
{"text":"Aussie Aussie Aussie.... Oi Oi Oi!

hahaha.
Was here with co workers for a casual Christmas get together and we had so much fun.
The pianists are so talented! :)  The one pianist white dude who rapped and beatboxed... Wow! I was impressed!

They have party packages or platters to share or else you can order all on separate bills.
The staff who helped me make the reservations were super nice and answered all my questions.

Tip:  combine the cash at your table and request a song! More chances of your song being played the more you \"tip\" hehe."}
{"text":"Aussie Rules gets 5 stars because I've been here at least 4 times and not once did I walk out not feeling I had a great time.  Unless you are lame (and those who are likely know it), this is guaranteed fun.  Some might consider it a pricey night with the cover charge, potential food orders and tipping the pianists if you so choose, but it's worth it if you splurge.

Should you go back more than once, it's best to leave a year or so in between to avoid hearing many of the same songs.  I've only ever gone on a weekend evening and it's typically packed.

{"text":"Great place to go with friends to have fun!!... I had a great time on Saturday night, I  enjoyed the energy of this place..."}
{"text":"Piano dueling bar? Why not! I didn't realize Calgary had one of these bars. I came here with my friends for a birthday party. It is a good casual venue to hang out with friends, have a few drinks and sing along with the music. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share - nachos, wings, fries and a veggie plate. There were no surprises here as it was standard pub food and everything tasted A-OK. Service was average. It did take a long time for our orders to get to us (at least 30 to 40 minutes) which was a little annoying since we were hungry. Our server seemed like we were bothering her if we requested anything above our order and was a bit of a stick in the mud for a place that was so lively and fun. 
The musicians did a great job and are very talented. Not every guy can sing Taylor Swift or Bonnie Tyler and still make it sound good. I applaud them for that but I think the show would be that much more fantastic if they could find a female to join their team to give some contrast.   But these guys did deliver and got the crowd involved and are wonderful overall.   If you are looking for a different option instead of going to a night club or hanging out a typical pub, I would suggest coming here."}
