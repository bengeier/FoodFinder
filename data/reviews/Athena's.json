{"text":"All around great place to grab food that is always of top quality.  You can't beat the value as their prices are very reasonable for the amount of food that you get.  Service is friendly, quick, and top-notch.  Athena's is one of my favorite places for lunch during the workday and dinner on those late nights in the office.  I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Solid pizza, excellent Gyros, good salads. Stay in a hotel near Athenas. The pizza is solid. Different than the chain pizzas you'll get around here. The Gyro is my favorite thing to get with a Greek salad. The Greek dressing is homemade and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The fried chicken and jojo's are great. The service is awesome. I went to pickup pizza and chicken one night, there was no special on the food this night but the worker applied the discount. I asked him why it was so cheap and he told me he applied the pizza and chicken special to my order.

Food is always hot and tasty and I have never arrived and had to wait. 

If you want some tasty pizza and chicken, check out Athenas!"}
{"text":"Delicious gyros, hand cut fries and fresh salad! We got our food really fast and the guys working were very friendly!"}
{"text":"We had Athenas for the first time last night. I'm giving 4 stars because, while everything was delicious and the service was great, our pizza was really undercooked.
We had asked for extra cheese on our pizza, which upon opening the box, looked AMAZING. Then I took a bite and the dough seemed soggy and undercooked.

The mild wings and mozzarella sticks were delicious though. 
Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"The Gyro pizza was fantastic.  The meat was very flavorful with perfect crispy edges.  We went with the mozzarella/feta combo and would probably get that same thing again."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Italian hoagie and fries I have had since I've left Pittsburgh.

And you certainly cant beat the lunch special price for the amount of food you get! After our usual spot stopped delivering to our work, we were recommended tosee if they deliver to us, they did and I am hooked!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious! We had the philly cheese steak, meat lovers and a pepperoni. They were all great! However, I don't recommend dining in. They had booths but didn't seem set up for dine in customers. I would definitely order from them again however I would take it to go."}
{"text":"Got the meatlovers pizza. Was pretty good. Ordered a gyro as well. Portion size of gyro was horrible. The pizza was small as well but was yummy. I definitely won't be ordering or recommending the gyros. Pizza will be recommended. Oh and when it was delivered they forgot my feta. I called and honestly the lady was so polite I couldn't even be upset..mistakes happen."}
{"text":"Great gyro and fry specials for lunch and dinner.  One day I decided to switch it up and order the cheese steak sub and it was super good too.

Trust me, if you like Gyros and cheese steak subs, you'll be happy with their taste and proportions."}
{"text":"I found Athenas on Yelp when I was out running errands....this was delicious pizza!!  My family's new favorite!  I also ordered a small Greek salad with home made dressing.  Delish!!  It was big enough for 2-3 people.  The pizza crust was on the thinner side and delicious.  Loved the sauce.  It was a bit in the salty side, but it hit the spot. I would definitely recommend trying Athena's!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes the fried chicken is beyond amazing. And the Philly Steak pizza is probably one of the sexiest pizzas I have ever eaten. It's a must if you are making a stop there. We might go back today."}
