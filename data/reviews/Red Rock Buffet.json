{"text":"The casino buffet is above average for Arizona with some good entrees and soups as other critics have described. Or so I am told by the friends and family that dine with me.  I only sample the rest of the offerings because the big deal on this place is  -  the times they serve all you can eat crab legs. The staff constantly refills the crab, even setting up a second station if traffic is high. Consequently they are fresh and hot - excellent crabbing! Slow roasted prime rib is also added on Sunday. It also is very well cooked and Delicious! I have actually taken time to have some of the prime rib and validate that it is very good. Take if from someone that knows every existing and past all you can eat crab leg opportunities, this is the best in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 0 stars. I have been here before, so I know the food is mediocre at best. But, my husband and I thought it would be quick. We left when they still weren't open 20 minutes after opening time. At 10 minutes after opening time Captain Obvious strolled by and said they would be opening a few minutes late. (Although 10 minutes is more than a few!) At 15 minutes after opening time the manager let us know that they were waiting for a cashier. She couldn't do it? There is nobody in the entire casino that can take our money? Idiots!"}
{"text":"Never again will we eat at Red Rock Buffet...we will visit Ft.McDowell and eat at the 87 restaurant, but not at this place again. We arrived on Sunday afternoon for a one night vacation. That evening we went to the casino where RRB is located and got in a short line to purchase the buffet. 15 minutes later the hostess (?) took our money and showed us to a booth. The table behind our booth, was unoccupied but had a large mess of food, paper, and other articles on the floor. Another group was offered that table and said no unless it could be cleaned up...the answer to that was they didn't have enough people working. The group offered to sweep it up themselves, but the hostess ignored their offer and sat them further back in the seating area. All through our dinner no one cleaned up that mess...my wife had to see it every time she looked up from her food. Now the food...prime rib, pretty good but a bit overdone. Anything else, nasty. Canned green beans with some almond slivers thrown on top; packaged mash potatoes with no taste except the salt and pepper I added; food that looked like it had been sitting for a long period of time (ie: film formed on top of the gravy); dishes miss labeled or no labels at all; one food spot with one little piece of what appeared to be meat and then just brown something surrounding it. Salad bar was decent, but no where near the number of toppings and ingredients that I associate with a buffet salad bar. Even the frozen custard (ice cream) dessert had a strange taste to it. In the middle of our meal a woman walked by with a portable radio and you could hear someone asking her to come over to the 87 restaurant...then you hear her say 'G..D..., I am the only manager on duty.' There was only one server for drinks and I feel fortunate she came by with a refill for our ice teas. I would have thought management would have thought the eve of a holiday may be busier and prepared properly with more help and better food. Afterward, my wife and I were talking and she happened to think...if the eating area was messy as it was, we wonder what the kitchen looked like...."}
{"text":"While staying at the we ko Pahrump resort, we attended this buffet.  I honestly have to say this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  The food was luke warm, the choices were scarce, and the food was tasteless.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I am sooo disappointed!  We made our monthly trip out to the casino for CRAB LEG night and learned they no longer have it on the weekends.... only Wed/Thurs nights!   Well, the place was DEAD.... what a huge mistake!  We go regularly and take friends.   We will find somewhere else to go for crab legs and fun.  It's the end of an era for our family."}
{"text":"Worst buffet ever!!! The food was awful. The crab was squishy, so you couldn't get the crab to come out. Overpriced. Not even a comparison to an 8 dollar buffet. The rice was over cooked, like from a bad cafeteria.There was a lack of dessert choices and the staff was rude. My husband and I were looking forward to an all you can eat seafood buffet and were let down. The iced tea had a strong flavor of chemicals. There was an overall lack of choices available."}
{"text":"Love the crab--all you can eat. Other items, veggies, great salad bar, soups and a variety of desserts and ice cream soft serve machine. Wait staff very friendly and.efficient. We will be back. Lines get long early so try to get here before 4"}
{"text":"Review is for Wednesday night: crab leg night. Tasty endless crab legs come with a price. If you're not willing to wait for an hour or longer, do not come here. It wasn't my first time here, but it is my first time arriving after 6pm. The line was ridiculously long to just pay, then more waiting to get seated. I didn't mind the wait so much though because in my opinion, this buffet serves the best crab legs. However, if you don't like to wait it is much better to come right when they open for dinner which is 3pm. Also, if you don't already have one, sign up for a card at the Fortune Club booth to get discounted price of the buffet. It is free to sign up and it'll save you $5. Gary is the manager and I really like him, he goes around each table to say hello and ask how everyone is doing. Today I saw him wipe down the table and chairs  next to us. Come here to get your endless crab legs, you will not be disappointed. Don't expect a lot of other food choices though because it is a small place and their main dish IS the crab legs. Their desserts are also very good and yes, they have an ice cream machine."}
{"text":"Terrible, cheap feeling, disgusting food for $30/person, dirty, bugs, rubbery seafood, fake mashed potatoes, at least prime rib gave it a one star! Wasted so much food since much of it wasn't editable. Couldn't get an iced tea refill to save your life. Don't waste ur time. I've been to cheep buffets in Vegas that were 300% better!!"}
{"text":"The Tuesday night prime rib buffet went from about $8.00 to about $12.50 which is not worth the price. The prime rib was good but everything else was terrible. I do not care for prime rib so I had spaghetti which was cold and the sauce was not tasty at all and the fried fish was hard and dry and the chicken was chicken. While I was eating a gentleman came to my table and asked how the meal was. I told him it was terrible and I would not be coming there again. He did not seem to care and he said he would tell the chief. I have to say I go there almost every Tuesday and Thursday and at $8.00 in the summer it is not a bad deal but at the new price I can go to any restaurant and have a good meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wondered over here at about 10 am on a Sunday. We were greeted not with a hello but a very rude \"We have no prime rib and no crab legs!\" We had never been here so we didn't know that was the normal menu. We said that would be fine we were just really hungry. After listening to the cashier bash one of the employees standing near the door and paying almost $40.00 for the two of us to get breakfast we were taken to our table. We both went and grabbed a plate and headed back. Not only was everything on my plate cold (ham, pork, some kind of breakfast sausage) but we didn't get a drink until we asked for a waiter after 20 minutes! The staff were all gathered near the drink station talking. We ate maybe 2 bites of our food and decided since it was cold we didn't want to be sick and left. We will never eat here again!!!!  **Update- This business did reach out to me after reading my review and have extended an invitation to try it again which I think is very cool. I have not had a chance to take them up on their offer but I think it says good things about management."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally got a night out without the kids and decided to play some bingo and eat out here. Specifically for the crab legs. It was fun crackin open a ton of em. My first time doing this by the way, not a sea food kinda person. Its quite amusing how people will have 2 to 3 plates a piece of these bad boys.  My favorite was the desserts, perfectly portioned little morsels, of decadent cakes and mousses, yummy. Oh I still can taste the brown sugar, cinnamon raisin butternut squash. However, If you do not like crowds then maybe not for you. The lines can get really long really fast. I would love to go back."}
{"text":"This place is great we love to eat here! They offer all you can eat crab legs 2 days a week with a very large buffet that has alot of delicious food to choose from they offer food for meat eaters, sea food eaters and vegetarian people. And of course a large desert bar."}
{"text":"Wednesday is crab leg night and the prices have gone up: $28 without discount, $23 with a low-tier card (which anyone can get for free at the players club desk), $20 for a high-tier card. The crab is pretty good with decent-sized legs, although the last two times I went, I got at least one cluster that had some kind of gritty brown residue on the shells.   The thing is, there's not much else worth eating. Vegetables mostly overcooked. Meat mostly overcooked. Desserts are terrible, all the cakes seem to be made from the same bland gummy mix. Salad bar decent. I'll eat there occasionally because I get a free food coupon for each week, but it's the weakest of the local casino buffets."}
{"text":"went here for lunch with Rand H. and as usual was looking forward to a good casino buffet. Well to start it was a good buffet but not great like some of the others. I started with a great bowl of meatball soup from there i had a lot of different Mexican dishes that were all ok  Rand thought they were not spicy enough but for me (spicy wimp) they were good. they also had oven roasted chicken that was quite good.then it was on to the sweets my favorite part. Well there was lots to choose from and i tried most but the only one that was was real good was the bowl of soft serve vanilla ice cream with strawberry topping. So instead of finding another 5 star casino buffet Red Rock only gets 4 mind you 4 is pretty good.                          r        m"}
{"text":"$14.50 ($13.50 if you have the free casino player card) for a Saturday crab buffet is awesome. It's not five star restaurant quality but it is darn delicious. Sometimes there's a lull in between them changing the crab tray to a new one.   I only get one set of crab legs at a time because I like to eat them hot/warm.  If you get tired of butter and crab, then try squeezing the lemon wedges and adding black pepper for a new dip.  On some days, they have a special on the crab buffet and it's even cheaper.  At busier times, they use an app on their tablet that will notify you via phone when your table is ready."}
{"text":"Pros: For the locals, this is a great place to have all you can eat crab dinners. The Meatball soup and Pot Roast was very tender and I enjoyed it very much. And with a free discount, this is a great place for the locals. Servers refilled my drinks quickly.  Cons: Built for the locals. Once you get off the 202 and start heading up the 13-mile run up on 87, the time and gas it takes to get there isn't worth it.  Arrived at 5:45, no line yet we were told to wait 1 hour and 45min. Actually it took about 30min to get in. And it was a good thing too because later towards the evening, the local people starting filling the line up to get in. And with only 3 buffet tables, the verity of food is limited. If you check the online menu, I kid you not, that is all they have. On special nights like Crab Legs night, there is always a line to get the crab legs. Since they are on the main course table, I still had to wait in line just to get some mash potato. So I just went over to the salad table and loaded up on Meatball Soup and skipped the main course line.   So in short, it's a small buffet. Golden Corrali's is bigger. Heck any Chinese buffet will offer more food and space to eat. And it's just too much people during the evenings that it is not worth the trip from the valley.   Oh, there is no Wi-Fi and you may lose your cell phone service. I have Verizon."}
{"text":"Skip to the last paragraph if you just want the summary/conclusion.  We came here for their all you can eat crab leg buffet during lunch. We had gone to the crab leg buffet at Casino Arizona just the week before, so we were really coming here to compare. At first glance, I was very excited. It looked a lot more elegant than the one at Casino Arizona, and they actually had crab crackers and other crab utensils (I don't know what they're called)! (Casino Arizona only offered nut crackers, which are TERRIBLE for crab!) Their food selection was very small, however, and that was disappointing.  My first plate of crab was mostly water & hardly any meat, which was bland. That was very disappointing. I ended up getting some of their prime rib and mashed potato and it was pretty mediocre. I had almost given up until I went back and noticed the crab looked different (it was redder). So I gave the crab another shot - it tasted better, but still pretty mediocre. We then came up with the conclusion that perhaps the buffet was just inconsistent about their quality. We were right. We waited until we saw a new batch of crab legs that looked a very nice red color. That plate was delicious! In fact, perhaps even better than Casino Arizona's, but not by much. We also went back for prime rib again when it looked a little more medium rare. The prime rib was absolutely delicious, too. Unfortunately, there was not much to say about their dessert, or about any of their other items. Everything else was either mediocre or nasty.  All in all, the experience was pretty good. The quality of the food was good, but inconsistent. Their service was not too bad. but better than Casino Arizona's. I also think their price was like $1 cheaper? Unfortunately, because of the inconsistency with the quality of their food, as well as the lack in variety of buffet foods, I don't think we will be going back anytime soon. Casino Arizona's buffet is about the same, with a much more consistent quality, and also a much closer drive for us. However, if you are looking for a crab buffet with some good prime rib, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Ok, not great. Food used to be better, prices also used to be better. Got greedy and changed chefs in the last 2 years. Pretty much stopped going."}
{"text":"We should have checked earlier for each day's specialties. Last Friday, we went here with a full gear prepared for crab-night, and then realized that we drove so far for no crab legs. However, service was still good as usual and the buffet wasn't crowded at the time. They have just updated a new station to prepare Shrimp Pasta on the spot and unlimited Prime Rib can make up for our disappointment. Be sure to check date and time for daily specialties before you arrive!!"}
{"text":"If you go on the lobster or crab leg night it is worth it although you have to make multiple trips since they ration the portions. As for the rest of the food very cafeteria like and not very good. The dessert bar is pretty lame with some items a bit stale. I still go for the crab legs and lobster but not worth it on other nights."}
{"text":"Went here for a meeting and found out the buffet cost $15.00 so thought I would try it. Big mistake. The tables were only less than 1/3 full at 6 pm. l found most of the food to be warm and NO flavor. Offered Prime Rib which was a good size cut (by employee) but again no flavor but, cooked just right for Prime Rib, which would be Medium Rare.  Good and Bad I guess. Fried Chicken was cooked just right (crispy) with a no flavor. Brussel sprouts had no bacon as advertised.  Also no Bacon Bits for the Salad. Overall I would give this place 3 stars for trying but would not try it again."}
{"text":"Ew. I think I'm still healthy after eating here, but it was the worst lunch I have had! Sorry to the really nice staff at this casino, but everything was cold or lukewarm. It was 4th of July! Use a Grill and grill some burgers and hot dogs!  Have some grilled veggies. I had cold Mac and cheese, and a premade hamburger with a too small bun. The salad was fresh and good, according to my husband. The food looked so bad that I resorted to eating the safest things, corn bread and apple pie filling. I ate one bite of green beans, they were cold but fine. The best part of the lunch!!!!!,,,,I won $200  right after the lunch!!!! Will not be back or recommend.......sorry. Ew."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is the best kept secret in the valley! We went on Saturday, for lobster night and completely feasted on Lobster, crab legs, and shrimp! The value is there, the quality is there, the service was lovely. Will not only be back, but we will recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"Went here for a belated birthday dinner just last Wednesday. I must say, it wasn't worth it! (1) First of all, the \"Fortune Club\" card can not be used towards any one under the age of 21...and each member of your party must have their own cards to save the $5. It's not much, but I paid extra  for several members under 21 of age. (2)The waiters were unsure on where to place you...they had us zig-zagging in line through out the floor for a table! (3) The vegetables were drenched in butter (4) The crab legs were dry and seem to have shrunken inside their shells, which made it difficult to pull out without getting your fingers all messy (5) the desert was nothing but baked chocolate choices. Fresh cut fruits or jello would have been nice (6) the meats were over cooked and have turned hard and dry--lost their flavors under neath the heated light (7) Drinks were re-filled with tons of ice, which made our drinks WATERY! (8) Staff rushing us by pacing around us, emptying our plates before we could even finish what we were eating...taking them without asking.     Maybe it was a bad evening for them....Will give it another shot, a last shot. We'll see how it goes again. If it doesn't change, we will definately NOT be going back!"}
{"text":"All You Can Eat Lobster Friday Night.  Should be called All We Allow You To Eat.  My wife and I have been going out to Fort McDowell for the All You Can Eat Crablegs for over 20 years.  Its one of the special Arizona places we always bring visiting family and friends to.  Its always been great and worth every penny.  So based on reputation we decided to try the AYCE Lobster on Friday night.  What a disappointment.    They ration you to 1/2 a lobster per trip.  And they bring out one batch of about 24 half lobsters every 10 minutes.  They are all rationed out in about 5 minutes and then about 5-10 people stand there in line waiting.    When you get your little half baby lobster it takes one minute to return to your seat.  Two minutes to easy the shrimp-sizec tail meat.  And another 2 minutes to eat the meat from the single claw.  So every 5 minutes you get up, get back in line at the lobster rationing table, and wait another 5 minutes for your next little lobster.   Imagine how replacing and enjoyable your lobster dinner will be getting up every 5 minutes to stand in line.  And since each lobster is the equivalent of 4 shrimp cocktail sized shrimp, if you're only an average eater, plan on repeating this routine at least six times.  If you're thinking you are like me - with the Crablegs I would probably stack my plate FULL of legs six times - in order to be satisfied you would have to, LITERALLY, make 18 trips back to the rationing table.  At 10 minutes per round trip (5 waiting in line, 5 eating) that is an hour and a half of this routine.  For rubbery lobster.  The manager was strolling the room visiting tables and asking people are doing.  We asked him about the rationing.  He said \"customers waste too much and people throw away too much so that's why they do it this way now.  It costs us too much money.\"  Its a casino I said.  Your short on money?  He just shrugged and said \"enjoy your meal\" cutting off any further conversation and strolled away.  He had no interest in whether we were actually satisfied or not.  Bottom line:  Crablegs night?  Go enjoy.  Lobster night?  Save your money.  Buffet manager?  Empty suit."}
{"text":"I was one of the fortunate Wild Diners who joined Julia G on THU, 03 AUG, for the lobster special. The RRB website says, \"...the quality is undeniable! And the prices are incredible.\" This is no hype! I was only there for the lobster, and that's really all, even though the line was continually replaced with fresh, attractive items. The management (Zac & Gary), chefs, and staff have these crustaceans really dialed in! I mean \"perfect\" in every way! I reckon that they weighed 1-1.25 # each, which should mean tenderer tail meat, and you get one half lobster at a time. Just one bite of that succulent tail meat made the drive worth it! These beauties were steamed to perfection! The large claws were even better! Add real drawn butter, and you have culinary nirvana! Management frequently checked on us to ensure that all was flawless. The only bump was the way-too-salty Brazilian fish stew. No matter! I realized that the tomalley (that green pancreas-liver organ of such crustaceans) was missing, Apparently they rinse it out to soothe more squeemish diners. I approached the kitchen, rather than the serving line, to inquire. Sous Chef Alan came out and soon enthusiastically retrieved lobster w/ that wonderful delicacy intact! He proudly described how they deftly & precisely prepare the lobster. What passion! What service! The story gets better, but suffice it to say, that this lobster dinner was unique in my culinary experience anywhere in the world! My desserts primarily consisted of best-ever, cut-with-a-fork, RARE prime rib w/ amazing jus & excellent horseradish sauce, paired with their creamy, luscious potato & leek(?) soup! Service from the buffet servers and our \"waiter\" Alfredo was faultless, attentive, and very friendly! It was an amazing and memorable experience for all of us that we all still rave about!"}
{"text":"Came for the lobster and prime rib dinner. It is as advertised with no frills. The lobsters were decent size and the prime rib was very tender and flavorful. These two items are the stars of the show as the rest of the food was average at best. The deserts were above average quality and the salad bar was solid. I think the ayce lobster and prime rib are worth the cost of admission. $26.95 w/ card."}
{"text":"Go here for the Crab Legs all u can eat. Steak was good too.  Very limited buffet. Chicken, fish, BBQ Ribs.  Only had the steak & crab.  Desserts are mediocre. Service was exceptional, never had to ask for a refill on the drinks. Server very friendly and attentive. Very small buffet & room."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Lobster buffet on St. Patrick's Day. Everything including the live Maine Lobster was delicious. The salad and bread were fresh and the Irish deserts were a plus! The service was beyond impressive. Really a great experience. Will be back soon with our friends. Thank you for taking care of us."}
{"text":"The buffet itself is worth it for the all you can eat crab legs.  My complaint is that they want you to pay full price for a two year old and an 11 year old.  I could see a discount for the 11 year old, may even of been willing to pay full price.  BUT for a 2 year old - serously - there is no way she would eat even $7.25 (half price) worth of food.  We won't go again till they fix that back to what it use to be.  We were regulars, monthly to every other month we would go for crab legs.  Well not any more.  They get it together then either raise the price to rediculous or charge full price for kids, common RRB. get it together!!!  Plus we are club members and were never notified of any of the changes."}
{"text":"We have been to the Red Rock Buffet many times and may not go again! We go for the crab legs specials, usually on Thursday nights. Just a few years ago, the price was $7.99 with players card. That advanced to $9.99, $12,99, $18.99 and last night was $19.99, which were the worst crab legs we have ever had there. There were 2 different batches of them, one were a dirty color and the other was a nice red color and large in size. The dirty ones were not good quality and the nice red ones were almost empty of crab meat.   It would seem that the higher the price gets, the better quality the crab legs should be.  It looked like the price and quality has affected people as there were not many of them there and usually there is a line waiting for tables.  Oh, we also spend awhile at the slot machines while there and usually do not win, so they get our money that way also!"}
{"text":"I came here for the crab legs buffet too because the bf's family kept raving about it. When I arrived there was a kid standing outside and he just reeked of crabs. It was kind of funny, but also disgusting.  If you're not into the (snow) crab legs then there really aren't a lot of options for you. I had some decent cod, fried chicken, ribs and mashed potatoes. I think there was also some fried catfish, fried rice, and lasagna. All of the food was brown which was a little unappealing (and unbalanced). There was also a pretty extensive salad bar and some so-so desserts. Everyone was really there for the crabs though. I made my bf crack and peel all my crabs so I got away with clean hands! Trust me, it is a lot of work for little meat. It's also amusing to watch people come back with plate after plate piled high with crabs.   Definitely not a Vegas buffet. I think the $14 price is a little steep since I'm not really that into crabs. There might be a discount if you have a players card. Doubtful that I will return."}
{"text":"Alrighty besides the casino, the Red Rock Buffet is exactly what they say it is...it rocks!  I had a lot to eat mainly the crab legs.  Apparently there's a method to eating it, but I'm still the \"grasshopper\" at breaking it apart.  At first I was pretty skeptical about it simply because we're in the desert!  Crab legs! really!?  Yes, my friends it's not bad for the price and for the amount you're getting.  If you enjoy it as much as some of my friends and parents do...I recommend this place - enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's a good salad bar because they have good cottage cheese (Rand)? Are you nuts? The steamer area is the only reason to go to this buffet. Many Chinese buffets have crab. The salad bar has all of the usual amenities one would expect. All of the desserts are grocery-store quality. They used to have whole cakes, napoleons, etc. but now cream puffs straight out of a box. The fruit pies are gooey with limp, doughy crusts that taste like they're full of hydrogenated fats; just awful and not fresh tasting at all.  Even the tiny dab of  whipped cream on the tiny slice of cake is fake. Because the pudding is straight out of a can, I would bet the soups are the same.  Mediocre in my opinion."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! $30 for lobster that was ok, but NOT all you can eat, so you buy those and get all you can eat of everything else. Everything else was old and cold and poor except the crab legs. Then when you leave you can't take the lobster you paid outright for with you. They'd rather throw it away than let you take the one thing you paid directly for and isn't all you can eat. Very poor business model and a complete ripoff for a substandard meal. Should have known when there was 10 people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for the all-you-can-eat crab legs at the end of the summer and ate all I could. It's all a blur now - as it was the moment I used the wet nap. The crab was acceptable because I'm a sucker for the little guys, but if you're at all picky you should run away. They had nothing else worth eating for the poor non-crab eater I went with. Leave those fools at home. If I'm hard up again I'd go back no problem."}
{"text":"Recommended: if you like crab legs AND you are willing to forgo ambiance, then this is your place. Make it a point to get their player's card and enjoy a significant savings for the meal.  All you can eat crabs is the special on Wednesday and Thursday nights.  Be sure to check their website prior to driving out to East Bumble...  One of the unique parts of eating in the Casino is there is no cell service.  This may be a pro or a con depending on your preference.   They are totally blocking cell service inside the casino.  Red Rock Buffett is a cross between a Piccadili, a shitty chow hall and a high school cafeteria. Almost everyone in here looks like they got their government check. Don't be alarmed when you are waiting in line to get in and you realize that you've inhaled a few cartons of secondary smoke!  It's all worth it (sort of) when you finally make it inside to be \"greeted\" by not so friendly staff members.  Makes me wonder what type of abuse they take from the not so friendly customers. I nearly got run over by a lady that looked like she was 70 years old driving a motorized scooter with a cigarette hanging from her lip and an oxygen mask attached to an oxygen tank backpack - seriously!?!?  If you are expecting anything fancy, this is not your spot.  If you want to gorge your face on quality, inexpensive all you can eat crabs and you don't mind the ambiance or lack thereof, this is your spot.  The Buffett is evolving. They have moved the crabs to its own stand alone station. The crab legs are pretty solid. Hot, steamy, and plentiful.  Do yourself a favor and wave off the server after they've stacked 2-3 clusters of legs, otherwise they will be cold long before you finish eating the serving.  I hear there are other options on the buffet but I have not had anything else and I don't foresee that changing anytime soon.  The Red Rock Buffett is located inside the Fort McDowell Casino.  This a few miles from the B-Line and Shea Rd. intersection just outside of Fountain Hills, AZ.  There is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Super overrated! During  father's day weekend it said prime  rib and seafood buffet... the steak was fine but seafood selection was below average... all the shells still had sand on it,  some were frozen so you can tell it is not fresh... there were 15 of us and one server ... couldn't get our drinks on time just before dehydration strikes!  There was a fly around the seafood area so I told the server and he said \"just kill it!\" WTH didn't even stop what he was doing to at least show some concern! The 2 stars was just for the cheese cake and asparagus soup... nothing else..."}
{"text":"**Don't eat here - just don't do it!!  Took my mom and auntie here for Mother's Day brunch and fully regreted my choice.  For $20/person, I expected decent quality food - even at buffet standards. No, they really missed it here.  I tried:  *Snow Crab: okay but overcooked/rubbery. Fresh seafood in the desert is tough, in their defense. *3 sushi rolls: worst sushi ever! Tasted like it was made previous day. Rice was bordering on being a little crunchy. Didn't finish. *Seafood Pasta salad: decent, but a LOT of mayonaise. *Soft-serve chocolate ice cream: great! But it's made from pre-made mix, so not too tough to mess up this one.   It was nice that they offered complementary champaigne, but again - $20??   Plus the overly-saturated second hand smoke is just disgusting. Plus, a small bug ran across the table. I felt SO dirty and will never be returning."}
{"text":"Came here after golf. Paid $14.50 and they had all you can eat crab legs. I didnt get them because i didnt want to deal with getting the meat out but my cousin did and he ate alot of them. I had the shrimp and some steak with mashed potatoes. Nothing was bad and that i had. The desserts where ok. Not like vegas but it got the job done."}
{"text":"We stopped off on Tuesday for their Prime Rib dinner.   With the players card, you get $4 off.   The salad bar had fresh ingredients and the ranch dressing was spot on. Then I began my meal with the Prime Rib which was salty on the outside but nice and tender on the inside. The  Au Jus was not salty at all.    The next thing I tried was the fried chicken which was cooked perfectly, but the batter on the outside was very salty so I ended up peeling off the skin.  Tried the Banana Cream pie which didn't really have any bananas in it and I only ate half. Probably should have had the frosty on a cone.The desserts definitely need some help."}
{"text":"Walked in to turn around and get a refund it was nasty. Mostly fried foods. It's a white trash lunch spot."}
{"text":"Just terrible experience with the all you can eat lobster .. you pay $30 bucks to stand in line for 1/2  of a lobster . Some sad ole frozen 1/2 of a tiny lobster. No service from the staff for lemon ( god forbid)and the manager was a nervous inept mess. I waited in line again for a refund . Never again!!"}
{"text":"Went here for Easter brunch different websites said they served till 4 not true closed at 2 then dinner started at 3 Lots of poor quality food for 27.95 plus tip and drinks  Casino has become dark and dirty only go if no other restaurants are open In neighboring areas. Shrimp small and fried, peel and eat shrimp not deveined, salmon on buffet tough, lemon pie no flavor, great rolls and garlic toast. Rest of pastry from cheap bakery. Better off at local grocery stores  Didn't try prime rib or crab legs or lamb. All meat tough in my past experiences"}
{"text":"We went to the prime rib and seafood Saturday buffet night. It is $16.99 with your players card and $21.99 without. This buffet is definitely a higher quality buffet. They had oysters, shrimp in shell, clams, mussels, Mexican shrimp cocktail, fried shrimps, and of course prime rib.  All of it was super delicious! The prime rib was a little rare for me and you can ask them to grill it some more (see pics). I highly recommend this place for their prime rib (it really is better than other restaurants). And their seafood was fresh. I also love their crab legs night."}
{"text":"Quality of food does not even deserve one star. The meat was dry. Most items were stale.. the deserts were bland and the staff was questionable"}
{"text":"Went to this buffet tonight for dinner and I have to say, it was not bad at all... After reading all the reviews and just the thought of it being a casino, I was a little worried... But I was surprised. The crab legs were tasty and pretty much everything else was good too. Not saying that this is a 4 star place but for a buffet, it is actually very exceptional. It was pretty busy around the 6pm hour but the wait staff was very helpful and attentive... I had the crab legs, chicken, shrimp, and beef and all were pretty good. I also had the blueberry pie and it was yumzo :) there wasn't a lot of cigarette smoke in the dining room which was great.   In all, for a buffet this is a good choice..."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this buffet just feels kind of seedy and run down. It's pretty cheap for snow crab legs, but you get what you pay for - about an hour of hard work for a few bites of crab. All other food was not terrible, but not great either. Pay the extra and go to Wandering Horse at Talking Stick. There you get king crab legs, already split for you, and the buffet is so much nicer, cleaner, and fresher feeling. I won't be going back to Red Rock Buffet."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place although I love crab legs more than most food. But this buffet was not that good if you weren't eating just the crab legs and the beef ribs.  The rest of the food looked like it was straight from a can, canned veggies. So gross. The casino is very stinky."}
{"text":"Bleh bleh bleh. Food is very below average. $15 for unlimited crab legs though, if thats what you're craving... Not the best quality but... Its bountiful.  The baked salmon looked white. All the meat was well over cooked. The veggies were flavorful though because they were just superly drenched in butter. Don't... Eat the cheese cake. The pies were edible. And the clam chowder and turkey rice souo were swallowable.   Staff was relatively nice. There was this dude that asked one of the workers if any hot fresh pies would come out and she said no, but offered to microwave one for him."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT here !!! I wish  could give this place zero stars . Me and my bf were hungry so stopped here on the way back into Phoenix. It was 15$ so we figured it was probably an okay Buffett . nOPE! This was probably one of the absolute worst buffets I've ever ever ever ever had in my entire life ! First of all Hardly any food items I seriously think there was a total of maybe 9 food items there was scrambled eggs bacon that tasted like cat food sausage,  shrimp, some rubbery chicken covered in this white sauce that was so dry and chewy , carrots from a can and a salad and soup bar. We tried everything and seriously it all tasted like cat food all of it !!!!! The only good thing I will say is the salad bar and abondigas soup ....  how did they get away with charging this much and serving this horrible food !!!!! Don't do it !"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here as he loves crab and I thought an all you can eat crab buffet would be right up his alley. I paid $15.99 for him and $10.99 for me as I have a Fort McDowell players card. Not badly priced...but you get what you pay for.  The cafe has kind of a dingy dirty feel to it and appeared to be badly outdated as far as decor goes. Who cares about that though, right? As long as the food is good, that can be overlooked. Dang, the food wasn't that good.   By looking at the slop they call fettucini with pesto sauce, you can tell that it's not high quality food...or even medium quality. I think the quality of the food can be best described by quoting a song, \"Shawty got low, low, low, low, low...\" I pretty much stuck to eating salad, which was the saddest salad bar I have ever seen. Basically you had lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, garbanzo beans, cheese, and croutons. There were only like four dressings to choose from.   Boyfriend said the crab was decent but not his favorite. That's all he ate because the other food didn't really look like food. Ever see the movie Vegas Vacation? There's a scene where Chevy Chase's character (Clark Griswold) is at a buffet in Vegas with Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie). The food totally reminds me of that!"}
{"text":"The buffet is gross and not worth the money. We went here to enjoy a night of Bingo with some friends to celebrate a birthday. We decided it would be easier to eat at the buffet beforehand. Unfortunately, it was a huge mistake. The only thing that tasted good was the salad. Everything else was borderline inedible. Won't be eating here when we come back to the casino."}
{"text":"On Aug 3, 2017, I hosted AYCE Lobster Buffet for Wild Dining MeetUp.    https://www.meetup.com/Wild-Dining-Phoenix/events/241864979/  13 attended.  Hope you can read our rave comments about the lobster in above link about our event.  Gary, the RRB manager and Zac, his boss Director of Food & Beverage for the casino, were so welcoming, and chef Alan even brought to our table, lobsters that had the green roe (tomalley) intact (which I think they wash away for \"you\"), cos we love that green \"butter\".  Our server Alfredo was just as wonderful.  It all made for such a euphoric experience, that I am changing my 4 stars due to late delivery from the airport (out of their control) of the live lobsters that one Thurs, to 5 stars.  Some of us wanna repeat our experience the following Thurs, cos we can't wait to come back.  So I posted the event again.  I will come every Thurs till it sadly ends (Zac says when they cannot negotiate a good enough price for the live lobsters)."}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat crab legs buffet for $12.99 with your player's card is a pretty sweet deal! My girlfriends and I had to wait 45 minutes on a Wednesday night just to get inside the restaurant. Once we paid, we were seated right away in a spacious booth and the server brought us drinks. We walked up to the crab legs line (another 5 minute wait) and were each given huge plates of crab legs, lemons, and melted butter. They were fantastic!  The crab legs and dessert bar are the stars of this buffet. They also offer a salad bar along with other entree and side dish selections, but these were just ho hum. To me, this makes no difference, however, as I feel the crab legs alone are a steal at the $12.99 price."}
{"text":"There is a reason that on Friday nights the \"seafood\" buffet is only $14.50.  Pacific Coast seafood buffet is about the same price and is far better with way more options. I'd don't really have much in the way of positives to say about this place.  Wait, my server was pleasant and enjoyable.  Now, first off, I would never bring my child to this place to eat.  This has to be the smokiest establishment in metro Phx.  Even though the restaurant is nonsmoking, the casino's smoke proliferates into every available pocket of space!  At the end of your dinner, when you get to your car and open your purse to get your keys, smoke will billow from it.    Now, on to the food...  You walk into the establishment and pay for the buffet much like u would at any casino buffet.  You leave your tip at this point too. Not an issue for me, but what disgusted me was the cashier tried to short my server on the amount of the tip that I left!  I kept telling her she wrote the wrong amount on the slip and the cashier kept pretending to not understand me.  But I've waited on a few tables in the college days, so we got that fixed.  So the seating area is approaching Dive-ey.  But looked clean.  They have an \"overflow\" room that people can sit in if the main dining room is full.   The most disappointing part about RRB was the food.  I can deal with a shady cashier, dive-ey atmosphere, but bad food is not an option when I have driven 30 + mins to get to you!  The buffet bar is relatively small with salad options - green mix, romaine and Caesar.  There are the regular Salad bar staples.  They do have a lady who makes a great pepperchini and feta mix from scratch that taste great.  The hot bar has mashed potatoes and rice.  There is \"prime riib\" swimming in warm juice and over-cooking it.   There was stuffed cabbage that taste like u can imagine stuffed cabbage tasting like.  Oh, yeah, I'm forgetting something, the seafood... Crab legs and fried shrimp.    Suffice it to say, I will most likely will never return."}
