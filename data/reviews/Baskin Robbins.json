{"text":"The worker over there is rude!! I was asking for free tasting before I made my decision and when I asked for the third trial, she told me, this is the last! Omg!! what kind of customer service is this?!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to get your cake at!!! I had ordered a cake for my daughters birthday and they totally messed up the order. It wasn't even my cake! I had told one of the workers it wasn't my cake. She ended up arguing with me. I told her to read off on the paper what I exactly wanted and she refused!! In the end she asked me, \"so do you want the cake or not?\" OF COURSE NOT!! Worst place to get a cake!! Horrible service!!! If I could, I would give them 0 stars! Never going back"}
{"text":"I was totally craving some ice cream and tried two other places, that turned out to be closed, before hitting up good ol' BR. 

I was thankful for the patience of the staff as my friend and I each tried 5 flavors... Excessive? I know. 

I decided on the German chocolate in a waffle cone and then the woman behind the counter let me know that since I was buying a waffle cone, my next scoop was free. Oh boy was I excited!! (Can you say cheat day?!???) After taking a so long to decide on the next flavor that the first scoop was starting to melt, I settled on pralines and cream. 

The ice cream was good, same as every other BR you've probably ever been to. The place was pretty clean. I got a double scoop in a waffle cone for about $3.50.

This place isn't my first choice for ice cream around here, but their hours on weekdays are better than most, the service was good, and the ice cream rightfully satisfied my craving."}
{"text":"The bathroom was clean but no soap, expensive ice cream free wifi. They have friendly employees at least one young lady was nice."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever. When you have people being served cups of ice cream give them a spoon.  Spoons should be behind the counter not where many hands will touch them...ever hear of sanitation?  Ordered coffee and server was going to add sugar/cream.  That is my coffee and I will add that.  This place is in need of training help.  Another business left to run by people who could care less about the customers and how to serve the product and present themselves.  I can't wait for Jarlings to open:(. Worst place ever!"}
{"text":"Other than the lady's being rude that work here the baskin robins shakes are always amazing the workers need to learn how to smile !!"}
{"text":"I used to come here and eat ice cream and drink iced coffee but I wont be back anymore. The woman working was extremely impatient and rude to me and my partner. We had a coupon for a bogo 1$ sundae with the only exclusions being a three scoop sundae and all the other bigger sundaes. Tell me why this woman was saying we can only get one scoop with one topping for our coupon...?  When we first showed it to her she didnt even know what the coupon was for. We planned to be paying full price for one 2 scoop and then getting another for 1$. Just a single scoop sundae doesn't seem right...  Anyway, I tried to explain it to her but she kept being impatient and annoyed and looking the other way.But anyway, we just ended up going to CVS across the street and buying a pint."}
