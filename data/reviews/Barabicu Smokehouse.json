{"text":"Let me tell you about this little hidden gem! This barbecue spot is located in Parma, near Snow Rd and Ridge Rd intersection. By the time you spot this place, you are already past it. This time circled back toward it. Upon entering I was pleasantly greeted with numerous samples of beef brisket, greens, and homemade meatloaf. All of which were to die for, without adding any sauce to the meat. The brisket had a beautiful crust, with the right amount of fat to meat ratio. The gentleman laughed as I said, oh my God while tasting it. This brisket gets 5 stars! The greens were cooked tender with a vinegary flavor yet sweet at the same time. The meatloaf was exceptionally moist, this also gets 5 stars! Also I tried the smokehouse chili which they gave me to take home. This was a generous 8 oz sample. Also I took home the Island smoked BBQ beans. They were flavorful but less sweet in taste. Cannot wait to go back to try the ribs! I'll have to get more brisket too! They have two sauces a mustard vinegar one that is like Carolina style sauce. The other is tangy sweet which is like a  Kansas Memphis style sauce. The mustard vinegar goes perfect with the brisket to cut the fat flavor. This is similar to Mabel's BBQ.. but a little less costly, and close to home!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! A legit barbecue spot in The Cleveland area...Parma no less! Pulled pork is amazing, melt in your mouth delicious. Brisket was also really tasty. Buns are locally made at On the Rise bakery on the Eastside. Side dishes we tried were also very good! Smoked potato salad...two thumbs up! Mac n Cheese is homemade with a nice creamy béchamel sauce made with parmesan & cheddar. They also have something called cupcake chicken...we didn't try it this time, but considering how awesome everything we had was...we will most definitely give that a try next time! I'd post a picture, but we ate it all too quickly to do that! Check them out!!"}
{"text":"I was at a birthday party that served their food. Incredible! Going there myself this week. So very good! They have a smoked potato salad!"}
{"text":"No frills. Great food. Super people. I'd eat here every day if I was closer. The meatloaf is ridiculously good. Brisket is some of the best I've ever had and don't forget the sauce."}
{"text":"Best smoked BBQ around...and we are BBQ snobs! This is the real deal. A must try. Made the drive from Bay Village; will be visiting again soon. Great job!"}
{"text":"Best briskett I've ever had. Staff was engaging and knowledgeable They'd be smart to knock a couple bucks off the price and make up for it in volume."}
{"text":"Great food!  A friend and I stopped by on a Saturday night and tried the pulled pork and the brisket- both some of the best in the city.  I have been to both Mabel's and Proper Pig and I think the brisket here is the  best.  We got the greens, baked beans, macaroni and cheese and the potato salad-- enjoyed all of them.  In my view the potatoes in the potato salad could have been cooked a little longer but the salad had great flavor.  The mustard vinegar BBQ sauce is a nice change to the usual BBQ sauce.  Can't wait to go back again and try the ribs and the chicken cupcake."}
{"text":"What a great find in Parma! This little gem is serving up some great, authentic bbq.  After reading reviews from other Yelpers, I decided to stop in after some Christmas shopping, and boy am I glad I did.  The owners were so nice and took the time to explain how they got started, their process, and explained the menu.  They even gave us some samples and sauce while we waited for our order.  Right now they are take out only, but are working on adding a dine in area as we speak.  I have to say their brisket is some of the best I have ever had- moist with a great smoke ring and just enough fat.  I could have eaten this stuff all day. The ribs were also excellent and very meaty.  I am a huge proponent of supporting local businesses and this place is  no exception. Bonus points, because they are within walking distance of my house and live in the city as well.  Great food, great hospitality, give them a try."}
{"text":"A smoke scented store is all the ambiance this place needs to pimp it's wares!  If you're looking to impress your girl with a nice setting, keep driving unless she grew up on a farm!  If you just want really good BBQ, stop and buy as much as you can stomach.    As of this writing, the place is only open until they sell out.  I came in at 11:30 on a Saturday, and they were already out of bacon.  No harm, though, as I was here for the brisket and the pulled pork.  Combined half a pound of each with 2 sides and a pop for $20.  Great deal!  The pulled pork stole the show.  Very tender and juicy, with a subtle rub tossed in for good measure.  The brisket had a great bark, but was a tad dry.  They have 2 BBQ sauces, one mustard and one ketchup based.  Both complemented the meats nicely, and neither over whelmed the flavor.  The mustard was particularly good on the pulled pork.  For sides I had the chipotle mac & cheese and coleslaw.   The mac and cheese was the spiciest thing we ate. Not overpowering, but very good with a very thick cheese sauce.  They prepare it right in front of you, so you're not getting yesterday's left overs.  The coleslaw was also very good, in a thick and creamy sauce.  Looking forward to a return trip and the ribs...."}
{"text":"These cats absolutely know what they're doing and knocked it out of the park on our recent visit there.  Upon entry, they asked if my buddy or I had ever been before.  Answering no, they immediately start whipping out small taster cups and we get the chance to dive into a bevy of samples...barbecued meatloaf, shredded pulled pork and brisket chili.  I am no meatloaf fan, but their concoction just might make me change my mind...super moist and full of flavor topped with their slightly spicy, thick sauce.  Pulled pork was also moist and tangy, and the large-chunk brisket with large beans made for a unique take on chili.  Although the samples offered were rock solid, I am a rib guy so that is ALWAYS my first choice at a new BBQ joint.  I ordered the half slab along with sides of chipotle mac-n-cheese and smoked potato salad.  Be forewarned that most everything on their menu is a la carte, so plan accordingly.  Nothing fancy about how they serve the food...ribs were wrapped neatly in aluminum foil (which i used as my plate) and sides are served in those half-pint style plastic containers you'd get at a deli.  Hey...less to clean-up and throw away after the meal!  My ribs came with their two signature sauces, the aforementioned spicy and thick sauce and a thinner mustard-based sauce.  Although I do love mustard, the thick, spicy sauce was the clear winner for me.  Ribs were just as I expected from well-smoked meats...great smoke ring and a thick bark made of their spice rub.  The meat was tender, but you still had to \"work\" to get it off the bone which is exactly as it should be...none of this fall-off-the-bone crap.  Ribs were great with just the rub and smoke, but the sauce (on the side!) took it up a notch.  As for the sides, I thought the spiral mac-n-cheese was a unique version of a traditional BBQ side dish...slightly spicy but still plenty cheesy.  The smoked potato salad had (what else?) smoked potatoes cut into large bite-sized chunks and mixed with what seemed to be a mayo and mustard combo sauce along with other spices.  I enjoyed this also unique twist on potato salad, but the only slight ding on the entire meal was not all the potato chunks were cooked thoroughly.  Maybe a bit more time in the smoker guys?  I also tried my buddy's beans which had a great kick and a lot of large beans...really good stuff!  So there's the rundown.  nothing pretentious about this place, and a group of guys who clearly love their 'Que and are trying to take great pride in it.  Give this place a try, doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Totally \"made from scratch\" BBQ in the best tradition. Get there too late and they'll be sold out!  Don't expect hold over from the day before. Everything made today until it sells out."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Meat was a little on the fatty side but it had really deep, smokey flavor that was awesome. The chipotle macaroni and cheese was delicious too!"}
{"text":"Great place! Will visit as often as I can! Had the ribs (very tender and meaty), chipotle mac n cheese and greens. Everything was well seasoned, smoky and hot. Friendly guys make the experience even better. I have traveled everywhere and try bar-b-q where I can. This place rates in top 5! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Small smokehouse with awesome food. I got the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got the ribs and we were both very impressed."}
{"text":"Holy hell. This place is fantastic. I had the baby BICU and it was unreal. Definitely the best brisket I've ever had, definitely the best meatloaf I've ever had, the chicken pot pie was incredible, as well as the jalapeño sausage, and the pulled pork was good but not great.For my size I got smoked potato salad, which was excellent. And chipotle mac & cheese, which was good. If you are in the Cleveland area and like barbecue you need to try this."}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue I've had since moving to Ohio in 1996. Just a small place but what it lacks in ambience and character it makes up in the food. I spent a lot of time in Oklahoma and Texas so I'm spoiled when it comes to great brisket and ribs but this place could have been transplanted here from any small town in Oklahoma or Texas. Get there early my guess is they sell out quick!"}
{"text":"Came in later on a Friday night to get some take out.  Bad news, most of the BBQ meats were already sold out.  They sold me what they had- the leftover brisket and corned beef.  Super nice guys manning the counter- they were very apologetic.  They offered samples of everything, which was cool.  We got the potato salad, coleslaw, mac and cheese and they also tossed in some sausage, which was nice of them.  Oh yeah, we also got chili as well.  What I liked:  Corned beef was smoky, tender and delicious.  I don't typically like corned beef but this was really good.  I'm glad we got it.  Chili: really smoky with hearty chunks of meat in it.  Not 100% I loved all the smoke, but it was delicious in and of itself.  Brisket: pretty good, not the best I've had but I'd get it again.  Would aim for more fatty pieces next time.  What was less good: I thought the potato salad could have been cooked a little more- it was a little more crunchy than I prefer.  Mac and cheese was a bit smoky for me- I just want plain old mac and cheese.  The meat is already plenty smoky.  I enjoyed my food and will be back for more."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is out of this world delicious.  We ordered a combo and you get to pick two meats and two sides... went with the chopped brisket, pulled pork, collard greens and beans.  I cannot stress how tender the meats and how flavorful the sides.  Super friendly service and huge portions totally make this worth the drive from just about anywhere!  Go now as they open at 11 am and close when sold out."}
{"text":"Hands down this is some of the best BBQ I have ever tasted in my life.  They do it right with just the correct amount of smoke giving the perfect pink hue in the meat.  The rib meat is that perfect give and take between falling off the bone but not quite.  Ribs are done to perfection.  When I went they had Meatloaf on special and it was spectacular.  I took the BBQ over to my Mom's (she makes great meatloaf) and when I walked in the door I said \"MA MEATLOAF\" and she tried it and admitted it was better than her own.  WHOA.  Don't get me started on the cupcake chicken.  It's moist, seasoned to perfection and smoked to give it that extra awesomeness.  I cant imagine the time they spend de-boning all the thighs and seasoning, and marinating the chicken, and then wrapping the chicken back in the skin and smoking it in cup cake tins....WHAT?  I dream about this chicken,  STAFF: Super cool peeps and they make ya feel right at home when you walk in.  I cant say enough good things about this place.  They even donated food to my Mom's church group for 300 people.   DROP THE MIKE: This place already won my heart, and I will be a customer and advocate for life."}
{"text":"We ordered a full slab of ribs.  Not cheap, but very good.  Tried a side of the smoked Greens and those were also very tasty.  Will definitely go back.  Want to try the pulled pork and beef brisket."}
{"text":"We had brisket, meatloaf, ribs, pulled pork, sausage, mac and cheese, and the beans. Everything was so good. I was out the on vacation and now I am back home in Cali. I have been craving the meatloaf. MOUTHWATERING food and the prices a GREAT. I will be back or have my cousin overnight me some."}
{"text":"Legit, non-chain, bbq in Parma, Yes!!! Solid! Parking in back! Hands sink in the dining room! Smoked Meatloaf is the bomb! Super friendly owner and staff!"}
{"text":"I found this little gem here on yelp and decided to go with my friend. A little unassuming on the outside, but as soon as I walked in, my mouth started watering. They've only been open a few weeks, but by the taste of their brisket philly and potato salad I had, I'll be single handedly keeping them in business for years to come. Amazing food! Can't wait until they get some tables so I can camp out all day and sample everything!"}
{"text":"Barbecue nirvana, welcome to Cleveland. It's about time you got here. Let's start with the meats. Beautifully cooked and smoked, tender to the bite. The brisket and ribs were true standouts. Pulled pork and the \"chicken cupcake\" (nicely made chicken thigh) were also great. Choice of sauces for the tomato and non-tomato based fans. The mustard vinegar was my favorite. Pairs amazingly with the fatty brisket -- just the right acidic touch. Tried two sides -- the mac and cheese and the baked beans. Both nice, though admittedly not as wow as the meats.   More than just great food, the people running this place are exactly the dreamers and doers you want to support. Jon took a few minutes to show us his craft and Barrie made us feel at home at the register and even handed us a snack while we waited.   Take out only for now. Tables coming in the new year. Can't wait to go back for that!"}
{"text":"Finally got to visit. Parked the car in the back lot & got to see the smoker & wood. The smell greets you as you approach the door. Awesome staff, excited about what they do, happy to walk you through what's available. We got a full rack of ribs, chicken cupcakes, sausage, mac n cheese & smoked potato salad. All the meats were amazing. I'm extremely picky about ribs & sausage. I'm not a fan of chicken thighs. The chicken cupcakes are fantastic! Bit hesitantly at first, & quickly realized there was no threat of \"funny\" chicken. All of the meats were perfectly smokey, tender & delicious. Hard to pick a favorite!"}
{"text":"The Best Bar b q I've ever had, top notch. Ribs are amazing, all star side dishes with generous portions! Must try the vinegar mustard sauce!! Smoked collard greens and potato salad."}
{"text":"I was in the area of Barabicu Smokehouse today and decided to check it based solely on the very positive Yelp reviews. First of all the guy working the counter was super friendly and obviously enthusiastic about his work and their foods.  I would give him 5 stars. I got the meatloaf, Brisket, potato salad, cupcake chicken and macaroni and cheese. It was all amazing, especially the brisket. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I haven't had more of their food. They were out of ribs which was slightly disappointing but that's just another reason to go back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! We have ordered take out a few times and left impressed not only w food but also the couple who run the joint. They offered me tastes of some items (for free ) that I asked about and were super genuine and helpful. I assumed they wouldn't last because I didn't think Parma had enough demand. SO glad I was wrong! Spot looks to be thriving. Can't wait to smash some more Barabicu soon.  Yummmmm"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place. Modest setting, but with plenty of seating. I ordered a two meat and two sides, plus a jalapeño cheddar sausage on the side, to go. I didn't plan on eating this much but figured I needed to try a little of everything.  Service was outstanding- that along will bring me back. I love our city, but it's rare to find such great service in Cleveland. Everything was packaged separately for to go, nice touch.   Food - excellent! I travel to KC and St Louis a couple times a year, so I have experienced the best when it comes to BBQ. The brisket was amazing, as are the sauces!!! Love em. The pulled pork is very good as well. The sides were good, surprisingly really enjoyed the smoked potato salad. Unique and on point.   I can wait to go back and try the ribs - highly recommend! And I wish nothing but the best for the owners, I hope they do very well and people support this local business."}
{"text":"Had a taste for ribs. Glad I went here. The ribs were great. Sauce not needed. As far as sides, I had trouble deciding between the chipotle mac and cheese and the smoked potato salad.I chose the smoked potato salad and was not disappointed.  A little pricey for lunch but soooo worth it."}
{"text":"These guys are putting CLE barbecue on the map! Jon has absorbed the finer details of BBQ from all over the country, taken best practices from each, and created something uniquely his own. This far and away destroys any other BBQ I've ever had. The smoked crust gives RIDICULOUS texture and flavor variation bite after amazing bite. The baked beans are the tastiest I've ever had. The ribs... my god, the ribs. That crust is holding in so much moisture and flavor! Big meaty ribs, not fatty, not gristly, just incredible. Seriously, do yourself a favor and get down to Parma. And if you're in charge of corporate events and need catering... CALL THEM. Your employees or clients will be delighted!"}
{"text":"I've picked up food from here a few times now.   The meat has good flavor and good smoke. Sides are okay not great. Place is EXPENSIVE though in comparison to just about any other BBQ place. The small sides that come with the combo are embarrassingly small.  Food is good but know you're spending way more than you need to for quality BBQ you can find in Lakewood (Proper Pig, Woodstock) or Downtown (Mabel's)."}
{"text":"Very good brisket and pork. Fabulous jalapeño sausage and Mac n cheese. We plan on getting to this part of town a lot more often around lunch time!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing barbecue I have had. The brisket was absolutely perfect...perfect bark, perfect smoke ring, perfect flavor..just perfect. The cupcake chicken is absolutely revolutionary in chicken related foods that I have consumed. My friend ordered the pulled pork and also stated that it's the best pulled pork he has ever had. He commented that another reviewer was correct when they said the pork was like a cloud...fluffy.   The only knock against the restaurant, which they are remedying after the first of the year, is that they have no seating...yet. They have a nice sized space that will make for a fabulous seating area for happy customers.   The food and the employees are worth the trip. They could not have been more friendly towards us and gave us samples of the sides to aid in our decision.   This was my first trip to Barabicu but will not be my last!  Thank you for the delicious food that you have brought to northeast Ohio! God bless you and your business!"}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue I've ever had, and I lived in Memphis for three years. I've always heard that barbecue is about the meat and not the sauce, but I'll admit that for me it has been about the sauce. No more. After trying their brisket and ribs without the sauce, I discovered it was so good I didn't need any. This is how barbecue should be.  Along with the excellent barbecue, their sides are real good and the service is friendly and helpful. We have to drive 20 minutes to get to Barabicu, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Update- Still very very good. Have been back multiple times since the original review and this place remains consistently excellent.  Brisket and BB's are my staples here. I usually have eaten my Brisket Sandwich before I even get to I-480..."}
{"text":"It took a solid 5 months, but I finally went back to Barabicu and have decide to upgrade them to 4 stars. My first review is pretty detailed so this update is going to be simple.   Pros -Staff is still very pleasant. -Sizes of the sides have increased and you can upgrade to medium or large sides now.  -Nice portion sizes in general. You could split food or stuff yourself until it hurts.  -Coleslaw and baked beans still good.  -Pulled pork and sauces still good. (I actually sprinkled some of the pork on top of a cheese pizza to give it something extra). -Chicken cupcake was a slightly moist and tasty hunk of meat that I enjoyed dipped in either sauce.   -They added plastic tables and chairs for seating in the side room.  -Ribs still lean more towards firm than juicy, but I had no problem tearing the meat off the bone this time.   Slight Cons -Still don't like that mac & cheese. I know they changed it up with some spices and now it's a weird brownish orange color, but meh for the taste.  -They get their bread from the grocery store when they can't go to a local bakery. I'd prefer it if they made their own cornbread or stuck with ordering from local bakeries but it is what it is.  -No desserts that I saw. (What about a bacon cookie? Pie?) -They don't offer pickles or onions with the meat like some other BBQ places do. I think it adds to the taste but really not a big deal.  -They seem to always have smokehouse meatloaf on special, but rarely anything else. Where is that egg salad with bacon and chimichurri sauce you had when you first opened? Unique specials pique my interest.    Overall I would say good job! Not the best I have ever had like some of these glowing 5 star reviews claim, but pretty good and they seem to be fine competitors with the ten or so other BBQ places that have opened up around town (add Hatfield's and Brooklyn BBQ to my prior list). Actually I'd say they were better than a couple of them. It really depends on what kind of BBQ you like (rubs vs sauced, drier vs juicy), also how important are sides to you? Some places have great sides but lackluster meat or vice versa.  I wish them the best of luck and I suggest you give them a try!"}
{"text":"Just do it. Eat here. You will not regret it!!!  We got ribs and brisket. Everything was cooked perfectly. The sides were Mac n cheese, coleslaw, and baked beans. They were all really good. I haven't heard one negative thing about this place or the food. It sells out all the time so get there early!"}
{"text":"Best Brisket in Cleveland! The potato salad and baked beans are also delicious. We really wanted to try the chicken cupcakes but they were all out! We will definitely be going back for that and the bacon!   The owner and his wife are especially friendly!   My only complaint is the Mac and cheese. The color and taste are both disgusting!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite bbq. This place is legit smokehouse bbq. I love the chicken cupcakes and the ribs are the best I have ever had. Don't pass on the greens either. You can tell they have a passion for bbq by talking to them. A few bucks more than average, but I do feel it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great Brisket with a deep smokey bark. Pulled pork with the perfect amount of seasoning. Three sauces sweet, spicy and mustard based. All of them are great. The spicy barbecued beans and jalapeno Mac and cheese sides are delicious.  The sink in the dining room is a very thoughtful touch for cleaning up after the delicious smoked food orgy. Can't wait to check back in here.  Check them out."}
{"text":"Amazing food and really nice owners!  We had the cupcake chickens, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and potato salad... the meat was very tender and juicy and the sides tasted delicious!! Definitely our favorite BBQ place in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Everything was incredible. The pulled pork was fantastic. The brisket fell apart......... then you dip it in this wonderful mustard vinegar sauce. The ribs were perfectly tender. The bacon. Oh, the bacon. I would drive here just to eat that. The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. It's a carry out setting with chairs and tables. It's the best barbecue I've ever had. We have leftovers and we have to run some errands. We just debated buying a cooler to get them home safely. It's that good."}
{"text":"As a man who has travel around the United States.... this place is on my Top 3 BBQ list."}
{"text":"Great service! The food was better than I had expected it to be! We will return in the future! I would recommend this place for catering, take-out, or dine-in!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at some of the best barbecue joints in the country and this is hands down the best I've had in Cleveland. I even came to learn that they trained with some of the pit masters at another renowned barbecue joint in St. Louis I've recently had the pleasure of eating at. That explains a lot as their product is top notch.   The brisket is my favorite and is juicy and smoky. The fat melts like butter in your mouth and it just falls apart as you bite into it. Sooooo good. Probably the best brisket I've ever had.   The ribs are great as well, but the brisket... oh that brisket...   The potato salad is smoky and amazing and the beans are good too. Not my favorite beans I've had, but they have a good flavor to them and they aren't so sweet that you lose the flavor of the beans themselves like some barbecue beans are.   The owners are super friendly and it's fun seeing their respect for not only the craft of barbecue, but also one another as they banter back and forth while they prepare your food.    I can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"My favorite local BBQ spot in Cleveland. Call ahead because they sell out fast! Can't wait for them to expand this place!"}
{"text":"Really dont know what happen here but went in to get some bbq. Noticed new staff so i acted like i never been there and asked some basic questions they had no clue what or how it was .  The brisket was dry  the ribs overcooked  ill give it one more try could have just been a bad day....."}
{"text":"Meatloaf! Ribs! Brisket! This place is worth getting the meat sweats over. I haven't had barbecue since Austin, Texas that made me go \"why is this so good?!??!\". This place has change this. And I can't believe I'm about to say this but MA, THE MEATLOAF. I am like 80% vegetarian just because that's what I like to eat, and I do not like ground beef dishes typically. So believe me when I say this is the best meatloaf I've ever had.   It was a Friday, so we also got the smoked corn beef. That's part of the reason I took off a star, because it was so salty. So so sooooo salty. Plus the side dish of coleslaw was very liquidy; that was the other reason for a one star off. But that's a simple fix, just add more cabbage if you have some at home. Regardless, can't wait to go back and be more of a carnivore!!!"}
{"text":"Solid joint. Get behind this place as the food is delicious! Modest prices and high quality bbq. Can't wait to go back! Highly recommend ribs, brisket, chk cupckae and cole slaw. This is a hidden gem"}
{"text":"I sure as hell am no BBQ expert, but as the cliche goes, I sure know what I like. And, I REALLY like Barabicu. Only been one visit so far but that's going to change this weekend. We tried the pulled pork and their unusual \"Cupcake Chicken.\" Both were just outstanding. We really like their vinegar based sauce, too. I have a hunch these nice and talented folks are going to be here a LONG time. At least I hope so."}
{"text":"You can tell that the food was made with so much love. Generous portions and such a steal for the money. You have to  try the cupcake chicken I have never had anything like it before"}
{"text":"Barabicu Smokehouse recently opened in Parma, and I am happy to report that their smoked meat is legit.  It has an amazing smoked flavor!  They smoke their potato salad and mac n cheese too!  As my kids are getting piano and karate lessons, I'm going to hang out at Barabicu. This allows me to try all their menu items quickly.  I ordered brisket, cupcake chicken, mac n cheese, and greens.  All of it was delicious and I can't wait to take my whole family back for dinner. The brisket was tender, juicy, and delicious. It had a nice crust on it that was packed with flavor. I loved it!  You can park out front on Ridge or in the lot behind the building."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is out of this world! For starters, it is take out only currently but they look big enough to add dining space. My husband ordered the pulled pork which was $8.00 for a half pound and all of their BBQ comes with both of their sauces on the side to try! I had the beef sandwich which was also amazing. I absolutely loved the sides they offer. The mac and cheese is different (they smoke their Mac and cheese) but pretty tasty and I absolutely loved their coleslaw which was more on the vinegary side. If you love BBQ, I would definitely come here!!!"}
{"text":"I thought this would be a BBQ joint run by Arabs judging by the name. I don't know how to pronounce it. I have been here for lunch many times and believe it to be the best BBQ in Cleveland. The bark on the brisket is great. Great sauce although it is unneeded. I have tried the entire menu and each meat is delicious. They have a couple different options including smoked meatloaf and chicken cup cakes (deboned thigh meat wrapped up and smoked). I am glad that I don't have to drive out to Mission BBQ by Parma Town Mall anymore with co-workers. They have good food but it is a bizarre experience and too cheerful. I like a nice cool and dark cavernous room like Barabicu to devour some meat like the primal creature that I am."}
{"text":"They have the best bbq I have ever had in my life. I especially like the smokey flavor of their ribs. Their sides are also excellent. Smoked potato salad, coleslaw, and chili are all amazing!"}
{"text":"The brisket was out of this world! Also tried the ribs and the cupcake chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection and well seasoned. Barabicu is very passionate about what they do, but more importantly, it is fun for them! Jon was so excited to tell us the whole story and explained about the different meats, how it is cooked, and what to look for.  I really enjoyed the smoked potato salad and I'm not a fan of collard greens, but my friends said they were the best they had ever had and got a second helping!  Looking forward to going back and having other friends try it, especially when they open up the dine-in portion. It is take-out only at this time."}
