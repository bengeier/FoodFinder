{"text":"We were in Concord looking for sushi and found this place. Although there are better places in Concord Mills, if you happen to be down in town this would prob be the place to go. Its a little place, could seem a little cleaner, not that its not clean just maybe old. We enjoyed the Crunchy roll alot and the other rolls we ordered were good. Fresh fish, nice staff and decent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Usually this place is good for me and my friends - good food, a little pricey, but good service. I placed an order for 3 regular rolls and I was told it would be twenty minutes. I showed up 25 minutes later. Young lady at the counter said one roll was ready, other two in ten more minutes. I stated someone said twenty minutes. She looked at me like I cursed her and said, But there were other orders ahead of you. I replied that if it couldn't be ready in twenty minutes, I would have been fine with half an hour or more (it was lunchtime). I paid for my order while she saying,  If you don't understand how a restaurant works, then you shouldn't complain. When I tried to answer that, she made the hand sign of someone talking too much and yelled, Blah Blah Blah you're still complaining!  At that point, I said to myself, F*ck that, in not paying $21 for 3 regular rolls, with a side of attitude, and asked for my money back, then left.  A simple I'm sorry would have avoided the whole mess."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite sushi spot! I have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. The food quality is a 10. The atmosphere is authentic and a 10. And the staff and service are also a 10. Very traditional, authentic and so good! 

I have attached a picture of our recent take out order, which was out of this world!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after having to go to the emergency room down the street...it calmed all of us down with an absolutely delicious meal...best Pho noodles I have had since being up north in Cambridge...my son got the dragon roll which he devoured and my husband got the green curry which he raved about.  Thanks wasabi cafe for making a bad day so much better!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant from road and took a chance. My meal was amazing. The ginger sauce on the salad was best I have had in the area and the sushi was tightly put together and very fresh. Very laid back place with great family atmosphere. Great service."}
{"text":"I meant to write my review yesterday. But I had the steamed veggies with rice. It was awesome. It will definitely be one of my go to spots"}
{"text":"The best place to get Sushi in Concord. The wait staff is always friendly and great service."}
{"text":"Have to update my review based on recent services. We dined in for the first time and waitress was very rude and not attentive. 

Sushi rolls did not taste fresh (ours are vegan) 

We decided to do take out the next week, which is what we usually do and each time we've ordered, the portion of tofu and veggies we get with the red curry keeps getting less and less. I mean, it only comes with green peas, peppers, and bamboo shoots. And get like 3 of each, no exaggeration and maybe 7 pieces of tofu. 

We won't be eating there for a while as it's 20 minutes away (so 40 minute drive time) and we only kept going there because the quality and quantity were good. But not anymore. 

I hope next time we order.. maybe in the winter, it will be better or this will drop to a 2 star."}
{"text":"Extremely good sushi. It is just a little hole in the wall, but I have taken friends and family there on several occasions. The only reason it is 4 stars is the price. It can be pricey on some of the items. I highly recommend the \"Pimp Daddy\" and the \"Green Hulk\"!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!  I have only been to this place one other time and loved it, but I always forget it about.  It's tucked in a small area that's not very noticeable, but I had a craving today for sushi and remembered this place.  I'm glad I wasn't disappointed.  Very friendly service and when I got home with my takeout, I was very pleased.  There are lots of amazing choices on the menu and I look forward to trying them out."}
{"text":"This is regular spot that I enjoy to grab sushi. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming. On top that the food is always excellent."}
{"text":"Came in here late on Dec 23rd and were pleased to find they were still open and willing to serve us dinner after a long day of traveling for me. Situated in a strip mall we knew we were rolling the dice trying to eat after 9 pm but it turned out great. The service was prompt, and polite (even asking if we minded what they had on the tv). They have the Asian beers you crave when you are out to this type of food on their list and some interesting sakes. 

We ordered food from the Thai part of the menu. I had a pleasing tofu green curry that was mildly spicy and had the addition of green peas unlike a lot I have had before but really enjoyed. My boyfriend had the drunken noodles which he loved. Both came with choice of soup or salad, I think my salad choice was the better bet because the dressing they use is great and very gingery like my favorites from college in DC.  Both entrees plus their sides were generous portions for under $10. We will definitely be back again to try sushi next time we are in Concord."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was ok. The decor could use some updates but it was ok. 
Had 4 sushi rolls and saki for $60. The saki was good. The variety of rolls was nice and all the ones we ordered were really good. One was made wrong but they quickly replaced it with a correct one. 
I'd definitely go here again, but probably on Thursday when it buy 2 get 1."}
{"text":"Have eaten there for years. Their combo sushi rolls are amazing and so it anything Pho!"}
{"text":"Always bad service. There is a young lady there who is argumentative and extremely rude and snobby with customers. I've noticed that sushi rolls come out different every time, also the wait staff has no idea of the products on the menue. Not sure if it's a language barrier issue but the service is always like talking to a mailbox. You may get what you want but it takes a while. The rolls though.... to die for! Amazing!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Wasabi. I typically order from other local Thai restaurants but it was Sunday afternoon and all of them were closed except for this place. Taking a chance on a new place, I ordered the chicken pad thai and the caterpillar roll to go.To my delight, both were fresh and delicious. I would order from here again but definitely to go. The restaurant itself could use some renovations and updating, hence the 4 stars. A good option for a Sunday Thai food craving!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!!     We had dinner there last night and it was perfect.  The sushi was  great and the service was outstanding.  We plan on returning soon.   Sarah Hartsell"}
{"text":"I usually only get to-go orders from here because it seems really dirty inside. The floors are sticky which is strange (and gross). But now after switching to to-go orders for quite sometime I am highly disappointed. I called in a simple order of pho and was told '20 mins' so I show up in 30 mins (because I know they always take forever). Upon my arrival they tell me it isn't ready yet. I ask how long and am told 5-10 more minutes. I question this because it has been 30 mins since I placed the order and ask how much longer. The girl's response to me 'I mean I can't tell you how long it's gonna take!' Really Wasabi? This is probably my last time ordering (in or to go)."}
{"text":"California roll was very fresh, great presentation! We also got the Thai Tea something new it was very refreshing! I love there red curry and Mee Krob. Staff is always very helpful. 
They just started a rewards program! \"Spot On\" when you visit 10 times you get a free roll! 
Stop by and see the Best, most friendliest sushi chef!! He always makes it the way we ask with fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here late at night since we were in the mood for some sushi. (Thank god they close at 10!!!) It's located in this strip, kinda easy to miss because the place is so so tiny! Inside looks kinda \"old\", and small, paint chipping, out of date decor but it gives it that local vibe which I like. We were seated immediately, service was really friendly! We could smell the aroma of the food cooking while we waited for our order, it smelled SOO good. We ordered the shrimp tempura, chicken pad Thai, vegetable tempura roll, baked salmon, volcano, miyako, and tiger roll. OHMYGOD this place is a hidden gem I swear!! One of the best sushi I had, and all for a great price too- literally a win win. My favorite has got to be the baked salmon & veggie tempura roll! The sushi rice was perfection, I feel like the rice normally is what makes or breaks the sushi. Really don't know why people don't rave about this place more! I'm so happy I found this place, and its literally 4 mins away from my job ayyy!! Already know this is the place I'm coming whenever I'm in the mood for some sushi!! Fosureee, I WILL B BACK ((;"}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Laotian food! Their papaya salad is on point! Be careful when they're backed up though. Many mistakes were made but they were very accommodating about it. The floor is really sticky and the space is pretty small so not that great for large groups. Food is affordable and don't miss their specials board on the right side of the hall as soon as you walk in! Appetizer sampler sucks, don't get it. The shumai is soggy and flavorless and the gyoza filling is bland and mushy. The crab Rangoon is bomb though! Larb Gai is a good chicken dish with Tom Yum flavoring! I love that it comes with sticky rice. Their papaya salad special comes with fried chicken wings that are nice and crispy!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: The place was dirty, the floor was extremely sticky, there was a mysterious brown liquid on the wall. There is no room. I hit the wall with my elbow trying to eat. It is literally a hallway with tables. The tables were clean and so were the chairs. 
Food: The food was merely mediocre. I got the veggie tempura roll but it wasn't particularly good. They gave me just enough wasabi for 4 pieces. And there was a creamy unidentifiable sauce in the soy sauce. My meat eating friend got pork dumplings and said the texture was off and it was bland. Their food was the best part. But nothing compared to the other sushi places in concord. 
Service: Was pretty much not great. We had to get up and get our own box for leftovers. They clearly favored a large group that made a reservation. They put lemon in your drink without asking."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get sushi!  The staff is always nice and are attentive.  Prices are reasonable and you get a good quantity.  They have other delicious Thai entrees as well.  They make an awesome red curry!  I would encourage any and everyone to try this place!  Well worth it!!"}
{"text":"My love for this little cafe goes far beyond the complex curries, or deep fried quail. I mean forget the awesome prawns, or spring rolls. Not to mention some of the most innovative roll combinations in the area. 
 They actually take the time to remember your name. Or \"Jackie\" the owner chef will give you an honorary nickname that will stick forevermore. I feel like family. They remember your likes and dislikes, and care about your overall happiness. Thanks for many years of smiles and great food!!!! #bigman"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for sushi locally. Food is consistently excellent. They offer buy 2 get one rolls on Thursdays which is a good deal. The only issue is sometimes service is good and sometimes it's terrible. Depending on who is there.  Usually ordering to go helps us enjoy our excellent sushi w out the frustration of it being a bad service night."}
{"text":"We love this place. We've been to many different places around and nothing beats their sushi!"}
{"text":"LOVE THEIR HANDROLLS. 

Service was quick and the food was delicious. On Wednesday they have a deal where if you buy 2 rolls you get one free!!! 

I definitely recommend this place for sushi in Concord."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is painfully slow. Several people around us left before their food arrived. Waited over 30 minutes on 2 sushi rolls. Other food seemed to be faster."}
{"text":"Wanted Thai food on the way up I-85 last night and saw this place on Yelp.

I'm a Thai fanatic and I try to eat at as many local places as possible whenever I travel. Without a doubt, Wasabi Cafe is at or near the top. 

Try the Aged Tofu as an appetizer and the Pad Thai or Green Curry for your entree. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My little family and I decided to give this place a try because we alway drove by it and was always curious so we finally got to dine in today. 

We were greeted with a great waitress. We got to sit wherever we wanted. It was more of a, \"walk in and sit wherever\" kind of thing and not them sitting you down so I liked that. With my 7 month old son, I was looking for a high chair and couldn't find one but the lady was kind enough to ask if I needed one so she got us one.

Ordered our drinks and it got here fast as well as our food. I got the coconut boba tea for the price of $3.99 -- it was okay, I had better.

We also ordered beef pho $7.99, papaya salad combo that came with either fried chicken wings or beef jerky and sticky rice $12.99 & Asian Pimp Roll $12.99.

The pho was okay. It didn't have much condiments or meat. Could had been better if they had them and tripe as well as tendon. I mean, who doesn't like those delicious stuff in their pho? 

The papaya salad combo with fried chicken was good. There was an option of papaya salad too, which I thought it was pretty neat. Laos, Thai or American. I decided to try the Laos and it was pretty fishy. Fish sauce wise. If it was a little less fish sauce, it would had been perfect. Oh yeah, 3 star spice level was pretty darn spicy. Next time I'm gonna try a 2 star instead. I didn't eat the fried chicken but my husband and kids loved it. Oh yeah, the portion of the papaya salad is kind of small for its price considering without the combo, it's $6.99 I believe? 

The Asian Pimp was pretty good. I will probably go back there to try the rest of their sushi though.

So definitely a 4 star from me!"}
{"text":"The good: 

~ I was greeted promptly as soon as I walked through the door. 
~ There was no wait for a table.
~ The waitress remembered my lemon for my water.  (This is a huge pet peeve of mine!)
~ Speed of service (I only had 30 minutes for lunch.)

The bad:

~ My sushi tasted like mush.  I seriously could not decipher what I was eating as I was chewing it.  So glad I did not pay the extra $1.50 for soy paper.  It would have been a waste.
~ My cashew chicken was meh.  There was no sweet heat as is typical with Thai cashew dishes.  I'm still trying to figure out what the flavor of the sauce was.  I think it may be tomato based, but I'm not sure.  The only reason I kept eating it was A.) I hate wasting money on food and B.) I really wanted to figure out what the heck I was tasting. 

The ugly:

~ The place is dirrrty and I'm not talking Christina Aguilera dirrrty here.  The floors are sticky and everything needs degreased.  I'm shocked they passed inspection.
~ The place is tiny.  It's literally a long hall with tables on the both sides of the wall and just enough room to walk between them.  You aren't dining alone even if you are a party of one here.
~ Yelp reviews have yet again befuddled me.  How anyone can call this good sushi and give this place five stars is beyond comprehension.  I have had better sushi at grocery stores and airports and that is saying A LOT."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Two sushi rolls, Crab Rangoon and spring rolls, plus my favorite - mango sticky rice. Very fresh and ready quickly!"}
{"text":"I love this place I love the noodle soup vietnamise style. The sushi rolls are great with a sushi chef also the drinks are great too. I love the family run atmosphere and service. I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The food is excellent. The specialty sushi rolls are creative and delicious. The ingredients are always fresh and the portions are a good size for the money. I am a good snob and I eat here sometime 2 or 3 times a week. The food is always ready in a timely manner and the staff is friendly and welcoming. The green curry is my favorite and if I'm in the mood for sushi, Concord Pimp never fails."}
{"text":"Average tasting food served inefficiently by friendly people.  But what should I have been expecting?  It is Concord, after all.

This small restaurant reminds me of something you'd find in a very urban area, small and gritty and of moderate cleanliness.  They serve sushi, pad Thai and some other Asian style dishes.  Jack of all trades but master of none!  I had the sushi, which looked decent but was bland, the rice poorly season and the consistency was off-- unacceptable for good sushi.  It wasn't terrible, just mediocre.  

Our server was very nice, but seemed confused by his job, slow and inefficient.  Don't come here in a hurry.  Meh."}
{"text":"We ate family style last night and got a little bit of everything.  Wonderful miso soup. veggie tempura was incredible! Fried calamari was excellent and had the best dipping sauce. Beef Pho was my favorite! Pad Thai was mediocre. We got a variety of sushi and we enjoyed every bite! Good service! Extremely casual environment. Favorite place to eat in Concord!"}
