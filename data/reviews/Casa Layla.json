{"text":"Delicious!! Hot fresh chips with guacamole fajitas and green child enchiladas!! Yum! Service was great, food freshly made, decor fun!"}
{"text":"we got here early so we would wait too long wit our girls.  We were seated right away as we were the first ones there. the food was good but the service just a tad slow.  We would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have been very pleased. The decor is very colorful and tastefully done. The margaritas are excellent and paired with the cuisine nicely. The service was awesome!  It was just what was needed in this neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Delicious fajitas and awesome chips guacamole!  Won't be disappointed. They don't serve beer yet but it saves you room for the food. The chips are freshly made. The fajitas are seasoned  perfectly.  This family restaurant is clean and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"The tacos are really good especially the Al pastor tacos I also had a green chile burrito and which was tasty. If you are going just for the tacos make sure you order a lot as they are small and tasteful but not as filling. The service was good Orlando my server continued to check on me throughout the night although the place was moderately busy.  I would go back again for taco Tuesday and order 10 tacos."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time after reading the reviews here on yelp. My wife and son and I each had 2 carne asada tacos and 2 al pastor tacos taking advantage of taco Tuesday. We were all very pleased with the tacos, very tasty. We will return for sure. Service was on point during the lunch rush, restaurant was clean, food was tasty and an excellent value. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a nice find. Friendly staff, excellent food that is obviously home made and a clean enviroment. Good value for you money. I personally love the Carne Asad tacos. This is my go to Mexican restraunt."}
{"text":"Such great food! The chips and salsa was amazing! I had a Carne asada quesadilla and my boyfriend had Carne asada tacos which were small but they were both delicious! We would definitely get each of our dishes again. The restaurant was small but welcoming. It took a little while for our chips and salsa to get to us but we were really pleased with the overall experience."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience and will definitely try again the food was fresh hot and made just like the authenticity it should be.  The presentation was wonderful and they definitely take that extra step to make sure that you enjoyed the food as well as the service. Even by the cook coming out to ask how everything is is a great touch of customer service. Now if they can have a margarita that matches the quality of the food I will be in trouble."}
{"text":"Quiet little hidden gem! The first time we we there we were greeted by a very pleasant individual and seated.  They make their own chips for each table after you're seated that accompanies an amazing salsa.  I ordered an horchata and oh my goodness that was probably the best serving of horchata I have ever had.  It was rich and creamy and not overly sweet like most I have had.  I ordered a taco plate and it was fabulous!  I especially enjoyed this meal because, unlike a lot Mexican restaurants, my food was not drowned in cheese.  The food came out hot and was great! I am now writing this review on my second visit. To those that give a bad rating because food took time, I say phooey to that cause it takes time to make a good dish as opposed to slapping dish together with things sitting around the kitchen. It's worth the wait. I have no doubt they will improve on this. They are new to the block."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated.  The food was on point, chips and salsa fresh and handmade.  I had a cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco with rice and beans.  You can taste the love and care put into the food.  I am sad it took me so long to come here but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing. Best Mexican food in town. The only thing that would make this gem better would be beer!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I wanted to try something new  for my birthday dinner..we decided on Mexican and we found Casa Layla. ..We were not disappointed. ..The fajitas are excellent. ..the meat was tender, veggies crisp and flavor and spice was great. The dreamer burrito was big, and had a lot of flavor.  We loved the beans. We will be back!"}
{"text":"DON'T GET YOUR FOOD TO GO! Not because it's not delicious to go (had it that way the first time and it was great), but because you will miss out on their amazing salsa.  Seriously, this stuff is fresh and outstanding.  I almost didn't want to stop eating my salsa when my food came.  But I managed to finish them both...pastor burrito is excellent.  Green chile burrito was very good.  Shredded beef was recommended to me by my server and that will definitely be next up on the list.  Overall the food was excellent, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch for Taco Tuesday and ordered each of the tacos. All delicious and fresh. They have complementary chips and salsa which is always nice."}
{"text":"Great street tacos !!! And fresh made Drinks you can even score a great deal when they have Taco Tuesday . A family owned Business located close to Asu west , Give them a try when you are close by ."}
{"text":"Love this place, only place I have found where the food is NOT greasy. Food taste clean, crisp and fresh. I had the carne asada burrito enchilada style."}
{"text":"Really great food and cozy atmosphere. Love that it's clean and somewhat hidden. Everything is fresh and made from scratch. It did take 45 minutes for us to get our food but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were the only people in the restarunt. Very surprised at how good the food was. Would have gave it a 5 star but didn't because with us being the only customers service time was a bit slow. They do cook to order though. When we got our chips and salsa the chips just came out of the frier. The soda was a little flat and was funny beacuse they use household like ice trays. Wished my soda was a lot more cold. Other then the service and drinks no compliants here. Will defenatly go back."}
{"text":"First time here.  I had the guacamole dip which was very good. 4 street tacos, 2 carne asada and 2 al pastor. It is hard to find a place with good al pastor tacos and this is the place. My agua fresca had a natural flavor and i could taste the little pieces of pinaple. Service was excellent.  One thing i feel they should improve is their salsa, the one they give you with complimentary chips. Other than that 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Everything is made fresh to order. I would recommend getting the guacamole with their homemade chips to munch on while you wait for your food. I love their fajitas with their home made tortillas. Super good authentic Mexican food. One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Very colorful and cute place!   Food was delicious!   I had the enchiladas (cheese and chicken ).  Beans could've been more flavorful.  A little on the bland side.   Hubby had a burrito and he loved it.  Tasted very fresh and delicious.   Salsa and chips were amazing.   Fresh chips and tasty salsa!  Next time we're in town we'll definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!!! I always call in, pick up my orders so I can't rate the dining-in experience. I love their chips and salsa and their pico de gallo is THE BEST!!! The employees are always very polite and pleasant!!! Very helpful and eager to please their customers:) Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! The food is excellent.  The quality is good, the temperature is right, and the flavor is on point.  I live in the neighborhood, but I won't be able to come here often if I still want to fit into my clothes!! It's evident that the chips are freshly fried and the salsa is made in-house from excellent ingredients.  I ordered he chicken and steak fajitas, and I was super satisfied with my order and service.  If it's slow enough, the owner/chef will come out and talk to you and thank you for coming.  I am really critical when it comes to paying for food at a restaurant because I usually think I can make it better myself. Casa Layla serves tasty food at a tremendously reasonable price.  Go support this local small business in our community and make your pocketbook and taste buds happy at the same time.  :)"}
{"text":"Freshly made chips. Delicious salsa... UNBELIEVABLE lunch specials ($5.99). And $1 tacos on Tuesdays. I enjoyed the enchiladas meal. The shredded beef was my favorite meat... Not the fastest, so maybe call ahead or plan on a good 45 minutes total for lunch. Not in Glendale too often but will for sure eat here again when I'm back in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We loved the chips. The salsa needed to be hotter but the food was so good!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We have been dining here since it opened. If you like salsa try this place out. They have some of the best salsa and chips I have tasted. We usually go on Tuesday when they have their street taco deal."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have great authentic food and everything is amazing.  They have a bean dip that has bacon and jalape√±os in it... If you order it, it takes a while to make but is totally worth it!  The enchiladas and tacos are amazing and they have some great prices. I highly recommend trying this restaurant out if you're in the mood for some tasty and authentic food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden jewel. The owner and family that runs it are an absolute pleasure to be around. You can get in on any busy weekend night with NO waiting. The flavors are like going to Mexico and getting it from a perfect restaurant. I strongly recommend for anyone to give this small business an afternoon lunch for $5.99, or a great dinner for around $ 9-11.00"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. We were seated within 5 min.  They brought us fresh chips and salsa delicious. The tacos were awesome chicken ,shredded  beef and Carne - asada. Also on the plate came a nice potion of rice and beans and a little salad. I ordered a glass of Horchata for my beverage , Yumm. My wife ordered the enchiladas which I had to sample, yumm. And a pineapple cucumber drink WOW  the flavor in that was amazing. 1st time here and I love this place I will be  recommending  Casa Layla to all my family and friends. AWESOME !!!"}
{"text":"Fresh chips! Fresh chips! Fresh chips!!!  I found hidden treasure!! Good Food,Service and Price ."}
{"text":"This is a great find for good authentic Mexican food.  Clean good food.  This is my first of many visits to come.  I tried chicken street tacos rice and beans. Loved the homemade salsa and chips.  Yumm"}
{"text":"Excellent meat. Thank you. Flavor was distinct and oh so good. El Pastor taco, green cheese enchiladas, carne asada. The fresh salsa and chips also...good."}
{"text":"Why did it take half an hour to get four street tacos! Isn't the whole point is that a street taco is a quick food to grab for lunch? I was actually late from lunch because they took my order and disappeared to the back, never again to be seen because I would have asked for my money back and left."}
{"text":"I have lived in Arizona my whole life and have eaten at so many Mexican restaurants and this is the best I have ever tasted.  When we arrived the gentleman at the front wss so friendly with a very nice smile.  It was not super crowded since it was about 1:30 pm.  He asked which table we would like to sit .  The chips and salsa arrived sooo good.  The chips were hot in temperature because they are made in house and they make them when you sit.  Excellent and so good.  Salsa was a mix of hot sauce and salsa super fresh.  Made on house also.   Our waitress was so cute.   Vey nice.  I ordered the fajita burrito.    the meat was so juicy and tons of flavor.  I usually have to add salsa to my rice and beans.  Not these ....the rice and beans were so full of flavor the beans were not mushy or not cooked enough.  i ate all the rice and beans which I NEVER DO.  My friend had the dreamer buritto.  It had grilled chicken, guacamole, cheese grilled onions and it was soo good.   They grill there onions have so much flavor.   They give  you so much food we hag to take half home.  This place is in a dive mall but dont let that fool you this place is a diamond in the rough.  Try it you will not be sorry.."}
{"text":"Not bad. Had the fajita chimichanga. A little mushy inside because the cooked it with the cheese inside instead of adding it to the top, but still ok.   This would have been four stars but service was extremely slow, and there were only three people sat. Also, they were out of sour cream, which would have improved the chimi or fajita flavor."}
{"text":"Blown away by the service and the food was even better..if you get a chance to deal with Freddy then know your going have just a great time"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Great service, and specials. The chips n salsa is worth the trip alone. Every Tuesday is 1.00 taco special,  and that's on ANY taco! Everything is fresh, and delicious. We're hooked!"}
{"text":"Dined there last evening. Really great food. The chips were fresh and very tasty, and the salsa was also excellent. I had the bean and cheese burrito and it was very fresh as well. Everything was just excellent. This will definitely become one of my regular haunts. Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good The cons is that the service is slow. Now I don't mind if the food is being made because that tells me that everything is made to order. However, the waitress didn't come to check on us and we had to ask for water twice. Now the girls were nice but I will say that was a con. The horchata was very tasty a little expensive for my taste but the drink was good. Everything taste homemade which I like a lot. The chips and salsa were very tasty and the chips came out nice and hot. I had the tacos carne asada and al pastor. The pastor were a little too sweet for my taste and the asada had nice flavor. My son had the carne asada with enchilada sauce and the sauce was actually made in house didn't taste store bought. The rice and beans were very good. Overall the food was good the restaurant was clean and we will come back and try some of their breakfast items. It's been hard for us to find a restaurant here close to the west side (this is a little north) but I'm glad we gave it a try. We will be back"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for Taco Tuesday. Really great little street taco's for $1 on Tuesdays, although be warned if you're a full grown hungry man you'll probably need about 8~10 of them. Their chips and salsa are fantastic, very delicious and gourmet tasting. The servers and staff are very friendly, however things always take SO long here. VERY slow. I wouldn't really blame it on the staff though, they are great, maybe just get a better system for managing the customers in their at a given time? Also several times we have come here and they have said something is either out or has not been cooked yet for the evening. Kind of frustrating. Still, very great little place."}
{"text":"Best chips & salsa! We had the Mucho Nachos, it was so big and satisfying we were too full for our entree. The horchata was super tasty and the customer service was excellent. No complaints."}
{"text":"Lunch took FOREVER despite being the only two people in the restaurant. The salad and fajita veggies were good. The fajita meat was super chewy and think. Not what I expected at all."}
{"text":"I'm here because of their $1.00 taco Tuesday and let me tell you that their tacos al pastor are delicious, make sure to ask for lime so it can complement your tacos. Most definitely I will come back."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday seemed like a good bet for coming here so that's when I went.  I ordered four street tacos - carne asada, pastor, pollo, and shredded beef. They were good, and I liked the shredded beef taco most of all - the meat was juicy and very flavorful. The interior has a cheery atmosphere, thanks largely to the brightly-colored chairs and festive wall decor, the prices are good, and service is friendly."}
{"text":"Quaint little, authentic, family owned, a definite must try!  I had a green chili burro enchilada style with rice it was awesome, highly recommend this place, the staff if friendly and truly care."}
{"text":"Freddy the owner is a great person, his passion for his food is awesome and Its totally worth a try. I have eaten at this place more than a dozen times and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Headed there while in town for graduation at ASU, surprisingly delightful. The cucumber pineapple juice is a mist have. My cheese enchilada plate was great, smaller than most mexican places but good."}
{"text":"Kinda stumbled upon this find.  Looked decent from outside.  Inside it's colorful, clean, cute.  The sign outside said Grand Opening.  Not sure how long they have been open.  The female cashier/host greeted me as soon as I entered, sat me down and said she'll be back.  U can tell they just opened because she seemed nonchalant.   I used restroom which was decent.  I didn't smell any hints of Mexican cuisine.  Placed order...several minutes have passed and no drinks...I mean over 10 minutes...and nothing......she didn't come back at all!!!!!!  So my partner & I left.  Don't waste your time!!"}
{"text":"I visited Casa Layla with a party of three. We were one of two tables and the second of those to arrive. After placing our orders, we waited 40 minutes before asking the waiter about our food. He informed us that they were understaffed, so the kitchen hadn't even begun to prepare our food. We would have to wait another 20 minutes.  I found this to be quite inconsiderate/discourteous. Everyone's time is important, and I feel that it is a restaurant's responsibility to inform the customer when a wait is expected to be unusually long. I told the waiter that we didn't have the time since we had to return to work, and we left without eating.  We've heard good things about Casa Layla and would be willing to give them another chance. I fully intend to amend my review should the next visit meet our standards, however I cannot recommend this restaurant at this point in time.  TL;DR - Waited 40 minutes for food, told that our order hadn't even been started, left hungry and bitter."}
{"text":"Food and service were wonderful. I'm rating a 4 star only because we arrived on a Friday night during business hours and open light was on, but doors were locked and no one was around. We came back the next night and all was great!"}
{"text":"Good food I had the carne asada burrito enchilada style and my husband had the El pastor tacos. Beans and rice just needed salt. Chips came out hot salsa was really good. Only issue is you can't use a Groupon with the lunch special. You have to order reg priced meal wish the t&c stated it but over all nice place"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, service is excellent, the restaurant is clean and the price is right!  I had purchased a discount coupon for this restaurant back in April, but it is about 6 miles from home and not in an area that I frequent regularly.  Thank goodness the coupon had no expiration date as this restaurant was a pleasant surprise.    Myself and two girl friends stopped at Casa Layla for lunch. We all shared the large pork nacho appetizer and I had the pulled pork tacos. All our food was fresh and very good.  The waitress was friendly and accommodating.  Food came out quickly and inviting.    Without a doubt I will plan to return.  This is a hidden gem on Thunderbird Rd, not far from the indoor swap meet.  So if you plan to visit the indoor swap meet on a week-end, include lunch at Casa Layla on your agenda.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I both love the cucumber-pineapple drink and chip and salsa!! We have been here two time and on both occasions The chip and salsa appetizer were really really good! we always end up \"cleaning\" our salsa bowl both time. On the other hand, everything else was just okay. The tacos were meh, both carne Asada, pulled beef and pastor were dried and overpriced. The nacho we got the second time was pretty filling, good, but pretty heavy. We kind of wish they would give a bit more salsa or diced tomato to even out the heaviness. Anyway, i gave three stars for the salsa and cucumber drink. I would come back to just order a to go cucumber pineapple drink and try the mango but will probably skip the food"}
{"text":"I went here on a groupon, and ever since I've been dreading going back to use the second coupon.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, I don't know, but it wasn't very good.  First, the chips and salsa.  The chips are small and hard, not like normal tortilla chips.  I get it, if they were good, to do something different or out of the box.  But these weren't.  Also, they charge you for chips/salsa refills.  The salsa was definitely not my cup of tea.  My girlfriend ordered a burrito and I ordered the nachos.  The nachos were done \"differently\", again, and they just weren't very good.  The meat looked like dog food.  The burrito was \"meh\".  It lacks authenticity.  With so many excellent Mexican options in this city, this place needs to do much better (or stick to Italian food, which the owners do very well).    We were literally the only people in the restaurant at 7pm.  I think that paints a more accurate picture than the reviews they received here.  Hint hint."}
{"text":"Simple good Mexican food. Very nice open space. The atmosphere is pleasant the food is tasty the prices are good."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh Mexican food. The kids loved the beef stuffed Mexican pizza. The carne asada tacos were delicious as well. If you like things spicy make sure to request the spicy salsa and spicy enchilada sauce. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place because of the reviews.   We ordered off yelp and scheduled it for pick up.   In a small strip mall and the decor was dingy as you walk in.   Female who greeted wasn't beyond friendly but the gentleman who brought our food out was beyond friendly and easy to speak to.   We arrive home and lay out our array of food:  Green chili burrito with green enchilada style Carne Asada burrito with red enchilada style  Carne Asada burrito with no guacamole  Pizza ala Mexicana with Pastor meat.   There was nothing special about this food. My daughter thought the green sauce was too hot for her. (Her own preference of course, I never tried it.) My carne asada burrito was just refried beans and steak meat and more refried beans. There were no cheese in any of our burritos.   The sides included a small side of beans (like there wasn't enough in our burritos) and a small scoop of rice."}
{"text":"Best mexican in town. Chips and salsa are so good and they have great lunch specials."}
{"text":"They have the best salsa in town, I would love if they started selling it to go because I could seriously use more of this salsa in my life. Service is usually very good. We typically go for lunch as their lunch specials are such a great deal. The food always tastes great and is super fresh. I highly recommend the enchiladas or burrito. Honestly I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu though. They don't serve margaritas yet but if they ever start we would probably be here a couple times a week."}
{"text":"First time here is close to home decided to try it out. Fresh waters had the pineapple cucumber water very refreshing. Salsa and chips were like homemade."}
{"text":"Went in this evening. My husband and I were the only people in the restaurant. We both ordered iced teas with lemon. The waitress brought us water no iced tea. I ordered a cheese enchilada and a shredded beef taco. My husband ordered a carne asado burro. My enchilada came with no cheese. Just a rolled up hard tortilla with spicy sauce. The taco was soft with cubed beef on top. Ok but nothing to write home about. When I told the waitress that they forgot to put the cheese in the enchilada, she argued with me that there was cheese. I had opened it and there was clearly only one strand of cheese. My husband's dinner was just ok. He thought it was bland. The restaurant was also hot, but they did turn down the air when we said something. Was hoping this would be a good place to go but will not be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The grilled fajitas were delicious, served hot right on the skillet. The green chili enchiladas were great also. Nice people, great service and clean."}
{"text":"I go here almost every Tuesday for their $1 street tacos. I would highly recommend the carne asada taco's. Chips and salsa are great flavor. Service is always wonderful!"}
{"text":"Food was very good!! We came in on a rainy Friday night. The only customers there, we were a little concerned ,but the food was very good! I asked for a side salad instead of the usual beans and rice,and it was the most colorful salad ever, I LOVED IT! They even came out and gave us free guacamole to try and it was very yummy too! Great service, very polite, we will be back!"}
{"text":"It was very traditional ! Very impressed ! Everything is made fresh in kitchen , including chips,salsa, guacamole .  The enchiladas and tacos al pastor were very very good !  Their pineapple-cucumber refreshment was fresh squeezed ."}
{"text":"Just good old authentic Mexican food. They don't try and mess it up. Come eat and leave happy. Only issue. Why charge me for chips on take out but if I stay and order the exact same meal they're free????"}
{"text":"Went here the other day and was closed and phone number didn't work just drove by again and it still closed"}
{"text":"The salsa here is the best I've had in Phoenix. You can ask them to make it as spicy as you like.  They make the chips and salsa fresh when you sit."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood Mexican restaurant!  I always get the fajitas and they never disappoint. I like to see hardworking people succeed in establishing a business. Can't give enough thumbs up for them!!"}
{"text":"Saturday 7pm and this place was a ghost town.  We should've headed for the door, but we decided to give it a try!  #1- No chips because they were in the process of making them?  #2- Soda was flat.  #3- No towels in the men's restroom.  #4- Chips finally arrive, not bad until I found out they charge $2 per order, even if you're ordering almost 3 meals.  #5- Menus, tables and restroom were dirty, kinda weird considering we were the only people in the place.  #6- This is a family business so I expected great customer service, but received the exact opposite.  Two young Hispanic women worked the floor and the cash register together, they were the absolute worst!  #7- I'm losing my faith in Yelp.  First a 5 star hotdog restaurant, then 4 star Marco's pizza, and now this joke of a Mexican restaurant.  This place is not anywhere near a 4-5 star restaurant,  thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Went there last night and the service was horrible. There was 2 other families in there so I wasn't busy. Service was super slow. We had to constantly ask for refills. The enchiladas are very small for the price as compared to other restaurants as well. The green sauce tasted like it was from a can. The waitress didn't seem to happy to be at work either. I will not recommend this place nor visit again."}
{"text":"The chicken was NOT fresh.  Portion size was Way off. Service personal were not trained correctly to handle food. On the up side the Kitchen was spotless.  Overall the restaurant was very clean. Got seated fast. And served very fast."}
{"text":"Top notch Mexican food. I love how the chips are made fresh right before they are brought to the table. The salsa is fresh too!! The carne asada is one of the best I've had and my favorite thing to order here. The prices can't be beat! The service can be a bit slow and I didn't care for their specialty drinks. Also last time we were in they didn't serve alcohol. On occasion I like a margarita with my dinner."}
{"text":"I liked it.... the other 4 didn't.    Good salsa,  fresh chip's.  Nice crew.   Bad beans according to the family.  It seemed liked white beans not traditional refried.   I had chicken tacos rice and beans.    Soda was flat."}
{"text":"I went there last night on a date and it went very well. We loved their complimentary chips and salsa! The chips have a very nice crunch to them and you can tell that all their food is made fresh. The chef even came out to ask how we were liking everything! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant! Food is delicious and staff are friendly! I had shredded beef enchiladas, rice, and beans! Mmmmm! My daughter had shredded beef tacos with a salad! She too enjoyed her yummy food! I will be going back to this place! Totally worth 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Edit: Casa Layla appears to have gone out of business. Restaurant has been dark and phone number gives an error message.  ---  The chips and salsa are made fresh and worth the extra $2 for take out. I have been here 4 times and tried the fajitas, carne asada burrito, beef/chicken enchiladas, and everything was on point. My only complaint is the wait time. The food is made to order so expect to wait 20-30 minutes if you order at the restaurant. Just enjoy their free chips and salsa during the wait. I also once waited 45 minutes for take out. Since then, no issues so it may have been a fluke."}
{"text":"Did not like any of it. Barely any meat in my fajitas. Salsa had no flavor and they put sour cream drizzle on everything... My husband wont eat sour cream but there was no way to scrape it off since it was all over."}
{"text":"Second time here I just had the most amazing Mexican food since I visited Mexico. It was great to have a true taste of authentic Mexican dish, so close to home. This place out does any competition. They have quality and humble customer service, that any restaurant wishes to have. My faith is good restaurants is now restored. It was funny to see someone complain about the food then ask for a box to take home lol. Thanks Casa Layla"}
{"text":"Literally the most disgusting Mexican food I've ever had! Chips were ok but the salsa lacked flavor of any kind. I had the enchiladas and they were soggy and gross. My husband had a quesadilla and it looked like canned dog food. Definitely never coming here again!"}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Mexican food, and I'd say a pretty high personal critic, I'm happy to say they had great food! The guacamole was amazing, the salsa fresh with just the right amount of spice in the hot one and the right kind of flavor in the mild. Served with homemade chips, it was a great way to start my meal. The chicken enchiladas with green sauce were awesome. Lots of chicken and sauce! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted tacos on national taco day so we decided to try this place.  At first we were not impressed with the decor but after a while we appreciated the simple ambiance it offered.  I had a clear view of the kitchen from where I was sitting and I must admit that I was a little skeptical seeing that there were only a few cooks feverishly trying to prepare dishes for waiting customers.  Also the fact that they were not wearing any hair nets was a little worrisome.   When we first arrived there was only one two top, one four top, and a party of 10 seated; all of which were there before we arrived.  Only the two top had been served up to that point.  I was starting to get concerned that our meal was going to take a while. The young lady who served us was great!  She took our order within the first 5 mins of us sitting down and promised to bring us some hot chips with fresh salsa while we waited for our meals.  I was amazed at how delicious these house made chips were as well as the freshness of their slightly spicy salsa.  At this point we were okay with waiting a little while for our entree as these tasty crunchy treats were hitting the spot.  We ordered the street tacos ($1 each on Tuesdays) which as suspected took over 20mins to arrive to our table; but as I mentioned before we were not starving as we asked for a refill of chips and salsa as well as a side of guacamole - which although delicious was almost $5!  Once the tacos arrived we were not disappointed.  My wife and I both had the shredded beef, chicken, and pork.  She also tried the veggie.  She liked the veggie for it's grilled freshness and it's chipotle ranch sauce, but we both decided that our favorites were the shredded beef and the pork.  Both had great flavor!  These street tacos come with onion and cilantro,  On the side there is lettuce, radishes, caramelized onions, and sliced cucumbers (which adds a fresh component to the dish). Please note that the street tacos do not come with any other sides (i.e. rice and beans); you must order separately.   If you are looking for a quaint little place that offers good mexican food at a decent price we would highly recommend giving Casa Layla a try.  We will be back every Tuesday!!!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  This place is really good.  The chips and salsa are both home made!  The quesadillas were excellent and huge!  We ended up taking part home for later.  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Gross. Don't go here unless you have low standards and low expectations. Cloth tablecloths. How can you clean them properly?? Covered in gross stains. Beans were bland and weird colored. Rice was bland and weird colored. I came in with my wife on Saturday around 1pm. Nobody was in there. Three tables were dirty with old food dishes from previous patrons. And didn't get cleared and \"cleaned\" until we were there 15 mins. Chips were burnt. Salsa was mediocre. I got the carne asada quesodilla.. for some reason it was stuffed with beans and guacamole. (The gross bland beans) totally UN-nessassary. Would've been better if it was just carne asada, and cheese with the guac on the side. My wife got two cheese enchiladas which were super small. She said they tasted weird. How can you mess up cheese enchiladas? Mexican food is not that hard. I went here because of the good yelp reviews. Thanks yelp.. for letting me down."}
{"text":"The food was good, bu they are lacking a bar...so, no Margaritas :(  Still, the lunch combinations are good and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are really good. The chips are thick and the salsa is just tasty. I got a carne asada burrito and it was pretty good. All in all it's a good hole in the wall place with pretty amazing salsa in my opinion."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, so good! Fajitas are DELICIOUS, and their chips and salsa... yum. Great, friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff definitely recommended , nice and clean and the salsa is awesome keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"Tasty guacamole on a white cheese crisp...refreshing. Right amount of food for a good price. Excellent flavor, not blow-your-head-off hot...makes my mouth happy. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here with a couple friends yesterday and it was delicious!  I ordered the carne asada tacos with rice and beans...so good! They also had really good salsa and guacamole.  The staff was very friendly and I loved the decor.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night There was no one in the restaurant and they took forever to bring our food the food was good but damn they are slow and the waitress wasn't very attentive  and they didn't see a any alcohol that really sucked"}
{"text":"We ordered the green chili burrito and al pastor burrito meal. Oh my it was so much delicious food! Next time we're totally going to just order burritos."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our lunch here!  Chips & salsa were great and the charro bean dip was tasty as well.  Went with the tacos and they made mine hard shell on request."}
{"text":"***this place appears to be permanently closed. Been dark since we last stopped by in early October and still closed as of tonight 10/22. Their phone # gives an error message as well********  Been to this place 4 times now-it's awesome! The food is authentic and freshly made and the server is always nice. The prices are very reasonable based on the quality of the food and likely due to the fact hey do not serve liquor. No big deal there either-they have a good selection of drinks. I can't forget to mention the chips and salsa-both are made fresh and are very good. This is one of our favorite spots now!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food!!! Family friendly atmosphere and very clean inside.  We're leaving uncomfortably full (in a good way). Overall we were very impressed can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"No fault of the restaurant more than bad parents, but there was a screaming brat which wasn't controlled and that made for a loud experience.   For a veggie burrito, had great flavor and decent size for the price.  Would go again to try something else. Eagerly awaiting more on the menu as the place grows in popularity."}
{"text":"This little gem is located in a rough area but the food is amazingly delicious. The food is authentic and fabulous.  The Al Pastor tacos had tasty flavor, the bean and cheese burrito was yummy, and the cheese quesadilla was great! The food was definitely worth the trip over.  Staff were very friendly and attentive and the restaurant was clean!"}
{"text":"Fun little restaurant, awesome salsa. I had the shrimp fajitas, delicious and a large portion. Looks like I have lunch for tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This is the spot for tacos! They have $1 \"mini\" tacos on Taco Tuesday! The service is great. Get the guac to go with your tacos!"}
{"text":"TACO TUESDAY!  Spent some time looking for places that have Taco Tuesday specials and weighed between the prices and the quality- you know determined from Yelp photos. I'm not the only crazy one doing this right?  You get served fresh chips with salsa, I opted for their spicy salsa and it was pretty good, loved the hot chips. Not too spicy either, it was more of a roasted salsa that was finely pureed. Their tacos are priced for only $1 on Tuesdays so I decided to try every taco on the menu minus the veggie one. I was informed that they don't do the Al Pastor, so I got two Carne Asada, Shredded Beef and one Chicken. I didn't think this was enough so got some rice and beans to complete the meal, they also included grilled onions and a small salad. Rice didn't taste like much, beans were filling and cheesy. The tacos were good, especially for a dollar though did not find any discernable seasoning to the meats, there was no gristly fat and the pieces were tender. They all tasted pretty similar except distinct enough to know one from another. I also got the Horchata, which I did not get half off like a fellow Yelper mentioned. The Horchata tasted sweet, cinnamon-y and not too powdery.   The only con was that the service took a bit long, considering it was tacos and sides. Around 20 minutes or so and there was only one other pair dining in the empty restaurant. The gal helping me was really nice and checked up on me often. The horchata was also pretty steeply priced at 2.99. In total my 4 tacos, bean & rice sides and horchata came out to be around $7-8 which isn't too bad at all for a meal.  Definitely will be back for the cheap $1 tacos! They're do-able, way better than that berto's stuff and definitely more \"Mexican\" than the authentic Taco Bell or Del Taco ;-)"}
{"text":"Love their chips and salsa, they are thick and thin, and the salsa is delicious.  They will bring extra, if you ask.  I am in love with their shrimp fajitas.  Hands down, THE BEST.  Get mine with corn tortillas, and am so full, when I am finished!!  I wish they served beer to enjoy with our meal, but that is a small point.   Please give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love the food, it's a small place so the service is slow, but it's not been an issue for me. I have tried to call before though for take out, and nobody ever answers the phone. I recommend the shredded beef tacos or burrito... and the chips and salsa are nice and fresh."}
{"text":"Good food great service. Gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because they didn't let me use the free coffee coupon towards my iced tea. Not cool!!!"}
{"text":"This is amazing home made Mexican food! I'm Mexican and eat Mexican food daily. This is fresh authentic stuff! It's like eating at my moms house but even better."}
{"text":"Came in for Valentines Day dinner. Very cute inside with all the cute decor. Staff did not seem happy when she approached us. It was like she did not want to be here. Took about 10 minutes for her to come back and take our order. We ordered our drinks and food but it took about another 5 minutes. SUCH SLOW SERVICE!! Not happy... The drinks came but they were flat...BUT the food is AMAZING!!! O.M.G!!!! The chips were also made to each order fresh!! They are sooo hot and so crispy and FRESH!! I got the carne asada tacos and I AM IN LOVE!! I loved the rice and the beans!!! I will def be back!!!"}
{"text":"No Margarita ,, it's a mom pap place very small . No one was there when we went there . Ok place . If u want a quick bite ."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and what a great authentic  Mexican joint. The fajitas were awesome and came with huge portion. No wait for service."}
{"text":"Good service, great food.  Small menu but what we've tried was excellent. We were here abound 7pm and the place was nearly empty."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, the waitress was attentive and effiecient.  Maybe expand the menu a bit with some combo meals."}
{"text":"Really great food and awesome prices. This is authentic, delicious Mexican food, and the restaurant feels like an authentic Mexican restaurant.   The waiters are so polite and will bring you as much chips and salsa as you ask for (their chips are out of this world).   Fajitas were great, enchiladas were excellent. I'd love to try more things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go! The owner Freddy take good care of you. Very friendly staff and great environment. Stop by and grab your food here."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby wanted to try something new, so we went on groupon and found this little gem. We were the only ones in the restaurant. Let me start by saying the salsa was amazing and the chips were freshly made. Over all the food was very good. How ever what we thought would be a quick lunch turned into a hour and a half lunch.  The service was so slow. That truly was the only down side. But we will going back..."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow, but the food was delicious. The rice and beans don't really taste. Other than that, the Mexican Coke and burrito was great."}
{"text":"I have been in this neighborhood for 24 years and I remember when it was paisanos my favorite Italian restaurant. Since they sold I have watched restaurants come and go in the same location. Now we have a great Mexican restaurant in our neighborhood and the food is delicious. I love the alpastor burrito because I'm use to eating Mexican food in Mexico ever since I was a kid, I'm 45 now. They cook your food to order meaning this is not a fast food restaurant and it is obvious that the ingredients are fresh. When you dine in you get freshly cooked chips with salsa and although I take out more than dining in I often wished I had the chips. Being in the neighborhood for 24 years I know all of the good restaurants within 5 square miles of my neighborhood and if you are truly looking for authentic Mexican food then this is your place. If you are a stereotypical Arizonan that has never traveled to Mexico and prefers Taco Bell then this is not your place. This is real Mexican food and if you have never been out of the country and eaten real Mexican food than you have no right to comment. Watch some bloke with a little penis just has to make a comment."}
{"text":"So far, I have only been here for their Taco Tuesday, which is an AMAZING deal. You get a choice of pastor, carne asada, pollo, or veggie taco for only a dollar. On top of that, the drinks are half off on Tuesdays. Total bill for 2 people for tacos and drinks? $11 minus tip. The tacos weren't the BEST I've ever had, but it's solid and you can't really complain much at that price point. Service was prompt and the girl taking our order was friendly. As for the drinks, the cucumber melon drink was very refreshing on a hot day and only mildly sweet - which is my preference anyway.  Just an FYI - you can't use the Groupon on top of the Tuesday specials. That would just be highway robbery."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!  Definitely want to see this place succeed.  Great family restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want to try fajitas, come here!  The best quality, best value!  That's all I can say.   I'll come back for more shrimp fajitas!!! https://www.facebook.com/tinhyeu2011/posts/10211035522143548"}
{"text":"Arrived at 1145 and no one was in the restaurant on a Tuesday for Taco Tuesday. As I was leaving a family of 5 arrived for lunch. That was kind of concerning that there was no business for lunch time.  I ordered 2 - Carna Asada Street Tacos which were very good, also wanted to try a Burro so I asked the waitress what she thought between a green chili or carna asado Burro and she said since I ordered carna asado taco to mix it up with a green chili. I did not really care for their green chili sauce in the Burro and wished I had ordered the carna asado burro.   The chips were excellent, almost like mini flautas and the salsa was very good also.  The beans and rice were average and nothing to write home about.  Our server was very good considering we were the only people eating in the restaurant. She did a good job by recommending instead of ordering a Burro a la cart to order the lunch special Burro which was less expensive and included rice and beans.  Would recommend the street tacos and go there on taco tuesday.   Very bright interior with different colors chair."}
{"text":"Unlike our first visit late last year, our dinners were barely passable, with the fajita beef in the burritos so chewy that we could not consume some of it. We waited over 50 minutes after ordering for simply two burritos, and we noticed that most everyone seemed to be served very slowly. The waitresses were not attentive to refill drinks. I was disappointed with my food and will reconsider returning to this place."}
