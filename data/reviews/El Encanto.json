{"text":"Here's the deal. This is a four star Mexican restaurant if the kitchen isn't jammed. I rated this three stars based on the food quality when busy. I love the polo fundido dish and the guac is above average. Pork stew and melted cheese apps are four to five stars. Go when it is slower and you will be happier."}
{"text":"We've been here many times in the past but it has gone downhill. Everyone at our table ordered pollo fundido and it was so dry that we couldn't eat it- even the rice was dry. The waitress was not very attentive either, we had to ask for drink refills, more salsa etc. Too bad because we loved this place but we won't be back :("}
{"text":"I ordered the chile verde and it was fantastic.  The outdoor pond is home to ducks, Turtles and fish. I will be back."}
{"text":"Checked in for a party of two, was told there would be a 30 minute wait.  In reality, the wait was 5 minutes.  Not sure the hostess' know what they are doing.  Was seated, took 10 minutes for the waiter to show up.    Drinks were slow to arrive.   Pollo fundido arrived cold.     Waiter never asked how the food/everything was.   Drink refills were very slow/non-existent.    Manager never came by to touch-tables.     Overall, have had much better food and far better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is bland and the drinks are terrible. The drunks are there and very loud. I would not recommend this place for anyone 9n a date or a foodie."}
{"text":"Fun for kids to see the ducks, turtles and fish but this place is a trainwreck. Had fond memories, but the last time I was there was 16 years ago. I remember it being yummy and a fun place to go. Unfortunately, it is now old and dirty, very dirty. They should close for a few weeks just to clean and maybe paint.  Had the fish taco special, was supposed to be mahi, it was a formed fish stick with fillers. Really bad. Tomatillo salsa had no tomatillo flavor. Actually nothing had much flavor. Two stars only because the pond makes it interesting, though it was gross and green."}
{"text":"Two stars for the duck pond. That's it. Margs taste like sugar water, food overpriced and actually tasteless. I feel bad because I used to love this place and I know people that work there.   But the food sucked last two times and the service was so so. Got a super bad vibe from my server because we just ordered apps(that sucked) one was so bad we returned it. Anyways, two  dry tamales and three margs (house!!!!)were 34.00. Still tipped $8. Sorry I didn't spend $75- but I won't spend even $30 again there. Bad food, rude service. Nice duck pond. That's all ya got."}
{"text":"I agree about the duck pond & the ambiance... However the proof of the pudding is in the taste.  On our first visit here about a month ago, we were impressed with the whole enchilada.....  However, tonight, honestly, the food was tasteless. Was it the chef's night off ? I had a salad with chicken on top and my husband had chili relleno with chicken. I asked for another dressing ( the first one was so-so) to save it , but i guess it was the chicken that had no flavor on both our dishes, that was disappointing.   The chili relleno had no batter, no cheese inside, just a green cooked chili with a few slices of bland chicken on top. The black beans tasted canned...The rice okay The soup with meatballs was indeed delicious. But I wonder, how could we like Mexican food without melted cheese ?  I have to say the service was fine and the manager did compensate us for our disappointing dinner, which was honorable.  Will we return again ? Probably not.  PS Rubio's, which is a fast food Mexican Grill, has set the bar as far as taste is concerned for us and it costs half the price."}
{"text":"I love Cave Creek!  This restaurant is so good.  I have come here on my birthday and pretty much everytime i go to AZ I wanna come here.  Best food and great margaritas.  Nothing is better than sitting on that patio with great food, good people, delicious margaritas, and 80 or 90 degree weather at night."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere! Not to downplay their great menu, but if you are looking for a great place to take a friend, family, date, etc. this is it. There's great seating outside beside the giant duck pond that features geese, ducks, and turtles which is fun for kids and adults. A favorite among my friends and I is the Jalapeno Cream Sauce which you could put on honestly any of the meals and it would go great.  Three different kinds of salsa served with the tables chips is another fun feature. Go up and treat yourself to one of their many margarita's, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Service was okay in the bar area... Margaritas were good. The food has gone down hill since eating here last year, was a little disappointing.  The shrimp tacos were pretty boring but my husbands fajita taco salad looked really good and had a lot of meat. Nice ambiance and decor."}
{"text":"Great choice on a Monday at 3ish. Quiet and have leftovers for dinner. Disappointed in the salsas though.... we'll be back"}
{"text":"A bit confusing at the entrance.  Had to walk a long distance to check in with the greeter.  Mole was as good as it gets, other than hommade.  Usually have to travel to hole in the wall places on bad parts of town for this type of quality.  I was highly impressed.  It was fun seeing the ducks put on a show in the nearby pond."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with options for indoor or outdoor seating, even a view of the pond. Our server was friendly, attentive and efficient. The menu offers something for everyone, including vegetarian dishes. We sampled a nice veggie fajita. The carneasada was tasty and the rib eye steak was of good size and cooked perfectly. We also enjoyed the chile rellano con pollo, with just enough of a hot, spicy flavor. The Plato carnitas was a generous portion of succulent pork. The portions were very generous. Entrees priced $12-18, beers $3. Great for a relaxed evening!"}
{"text":"What a gorgeous and unique restaurant! I love the pond in the middle where you can feed the ducks, turtles and koi fish. Well, that was my son's favorite part :-). They also have someone playing the guitar and a dancer who performs. I don't know what you call that type of dancer but it's the type that clicks the little wooden things in her hands. My son loved watching her dance and even joined her! It was really cute. This place is always busy and you usually have to wait quite a while to get a seat especially on the weekends (that's the reason for only 4 stars). The food is really good too, but this place is all about the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere inside but even better out.  The food is always good, though I believe the food and drink are a little over priced.  Service has been hit or miss during our visits but generally okay."}
{"text":"My first experience at this restaurant was very positive. Very cool place; I really like the way it is set up. It was super nice outside so we ate outside on the patio. Service was great! Our waiter was very attentive and nice. The only issue was that gratuity was added to the check. There were 8 of us all together (including 2 kids) with 3 separate checks. We would have tipped the waiter more than what was added. The food was delicious! I ordered cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and I would love to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Awesome mexican food I will be back portions are huge the pond is quaint overall love the place my only complaint is cave Creek is a bit of a hike."}
{"text":"I've been to this place three times. One thing I will say is they have a great atmosphere, both the original restaurant in Cave Creek and the one off of Carefree Highway.      All three times my meal was fairly mediocre. Not incredibly tasty.     I noticed there are not that many items on the menu. The beans and rice are good. But they do not allow for deviations to the menu! Don't ask them to change something, put this or that on the side, or add something to the meal. When we tried to do that the waitress said \"unfortunately, that's the way it comes, sorry.\" Yet I can go to burger king and do that with a whopper, no problem.      I'm a vegetarian and so I often find myself changing something here or there on a menu item. Usually it works out. But I guess they don't really do that at El Encanto."}
{"text":"Even though this place has been around forever...the ambiance basically makes everything amazing :)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. If you have experienced El Encanto in Cave Creek, it is the same great food and Margarita that are perfectly done. Best thing is now you don't have to drive to cave creek just to get good Mexican food and Margarita's."}
{"text":"Been going here for 20 years. Hard to find this kind of charm with the pond and architecture. Great escape. You have to know the menu for the best finds. Some of it is great and some very average. I love the stew and the ceviche. Frozen Margaritas are powerful. Last time I was there we had great service from a young man with an accent. How to improve? I wish they would put an end to constant buzz of the margarita machine at the bar. It hurts the ambiance. I would quite that down and turn on some music for a great improvement. Metal chairs with Mexican blankets are charming but old and uncomfortable. Time for a change. Fix the torn drop down sun shades. Come on, what are you thinking?"}
{"text":"Good tacos and great atmosphere. The pond was teeming with wildlife and a very good place"}
{"text":"Meh... Lots of flies buzzing us INSIDE.. We ended up moving to a different table to avoid them.  Food was ok. Service was good. Margaritas were excellent.  Salsa was average.  There is too much competition for me to bother going back."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance, great service, and good food. I don't eat meat so I had fish tacos, grilled vs fried.  My meal was okay but the margarita, chips, and salsa were very good. My husband thought his meal was great, unfortunately I don't recall what he had - something with meat no doubt. I would definitely visit again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm in town on business and was told by my hotel staff that El Encanto was a great place to go for Mexican food.   The atmosphere is great. The tables, decor, duck pond on the patio are worth a visit. I would stick to drinks and salsa though.  My make-your-own margarita was good and the salsas were really tasty so I was extremely disappointed when I got the guacamole. Probably some of the worst I've ever had.   I ordered the Chile Relleno for dinner which was also gross. The dish itself was average but I could tell the second I got it that it had been sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen for a while. Everything was dry, the melted cheese was hardened and the sauce had that layer of film on top. Blaaah.   After reading others' complaints about dry food and the staff being unwilling to make changes to the menu, I'm convinced they pre-cook dishes and let them sit under the heat lamps until someone orders one. I've worked in restaurants and know exactly how a plate looks that has been left in the window. A lot of the dishes I saw looked that way.   Service was slowish but my server was nice. He took the guac off my bill because I barely touched it. I hadn't even complained. Wonder if he's used to that...  So go early for drinks, salsa and ducks but don't waste your money on the overpriced food."}
{"text":"This place is in the new OdySea Aquarium courtyard. My family wanted pizza and I didn't, so I popped in here. Super sweet staff made me a fish entree plate to go lickety-split. I was really surprised by how delicious the food was for the extremely reasonable price."}
{"text":"Hadn't been back here in sometime. Was very disappointed at the slow service and mediocre food quality. Sure not like it used to be. Even the manager negotiated what she'd bring in response to a simple request for sour cream. Too bad. Used to be a favorite with good food, drinks, service, and ambiance. Seems even the ducks have moved on."}
{"text":"I liked this place. I got the fundido and it was very good. My husband got the carne asada and it was really tasty too. If you don't like eating by a pond, then don't go. Personally I thought it was a unique and fun experience. There are seats indoors with glass between you and the pond if you are worried about an amoeba or duck poo jumping into your food. Oh, and the margaritas are OUTSTANDING...and I am very picky about margaritas.  If you are ever bored on a Sunday in October definitely check out their farmer's market. We went there for brunch yesterday...it was very good! They had an omelet bar, waffle bar, fresh fruit and pastries, and also some standard Mexican fare. The market was fun...bought some excellent pineapple habanero jelly. I wouldn't recommend the popcorn though, brought it home and it was STALE."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here last night.  It used to be one of our favs, but we will NEVER go back.  Used to be where we would take out-of-town guests, etc.  NEVER AGAIN.  We requested patio seating with the expectation that we would be warm enough with one of the gas heater lamps.  Were seated just far enough from the closest one so that it did not radiate heat to us.  We asked the waiter if he could move the one behind us (which was at a table that no one was sitting at) a little closer to us.  He got this startled look on his face and said that he'd have to ask the manager.  About 10 minutes later, he came back and said the manager said no.  Excuse me?  So we sat and ate in the chilly weather as quickly as we could.  Would not have stayed except food had been ordered, drinks on table, etc.  All heaters were placed around tables near the entrance so passersby would be enticed in.  No heaters were located in the rest of the patio seating.  I imagine most other patrons farther back were cold as well.  Besides that, there were children running rampant - no supervision - grabbing our table as they passed by under a tree.  Totally disgusted with this place and will not return.  When the lure of profit exceeds hospitality - extending to the warmth of customers already there ....  Will not return and will warn everyone I know to do the same.  Poor Poor Poor managment"}
{"text":"This was not a pleasant experience. The service was slow, inaccurate, and low quality. The ahi tuna tacos were overcooked and were served incorrectly twice.  The wine tasted like it had gone bad and when one of us ordered a tequila with lime juice, we received a margarita instead. Dinner was served at different times and the appetizers were served without small plates. This was our Fathers Day dinner so it was disappointing to have such a bad experience .  Won't be back. Pacifico was cold though."}
{"text":"Invited by a group of friends, food was less than marginal, cool place, but dirty; low service, although they were not busy - roof leaks when it rains - critters..."}
{"text":"I was excited to get Mexican food while visiting Arizona and this restaurant is so cute it looked great. We were happy with the seating and it was packed. But the food did not live up to our expectations. The dishes ranged from mediocre (the meat dishes) to horrible. The vegetarian dish was the worst. Multiple dishes marked vegetarian (with their symbol system on the menu) actually weren't when I inquired about the sauce. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and ended up with a plate of rice and beans. Literally. Half the plate was refried beans and rice. The other half was an uncooked flour tortilla with the exact same rice and beans and a tiny bit of melted cheese. I asked for more salsa and some guacamole for some flavor but even the guacamole was rather tasteless. I literally could have made this dish with a tortilla and some refried beans from a can. So disappointed with this."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good mexican food, this is the place to go. The duck pond is awesome! the chips and salsa are delicious! i had a machaca burrito with green sauce! def the best!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time last night and it was solid.  We didn't have to wait long for a table indoors (they could seat us outside immediately but we opted to wait 10 minutes to sit inside) and the service was prompt.  We split fajitas, which were decent.  We did need to ask for more tortillas, then a side of rice (they only came with beans and some pico de gallo) and an extra side of pico.  We will definitely be back to try some other options on their menu.    Oh and the huge pond outside with the ducks and turtles seemed a huge hit with everyone - kids and adults alike!  It was fun to go out there after dinner and watch the kids feed the animals."}
{"text":"Not bad given the limited choices in the Cave Creek / Carefree area.  Would rate it four stars if they used a better flour tortilla for their burritos.  Their tortillas taste like the cheap ones you would buy in a grocery store.  Nice ambience for casual Mexican Food and would be better if they cleaned the pond water."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant for a Sunday lunch. It has a very good Mexican ambience and is perfect for both indoor and outdoor seating. They have a huge duck pond which makes for good viewing while you eat. The mandatory chips and salsa are good. The green one is the best. We had the shrimp ceviche which was very refreshing with the cucumber, avocado, onions and cilantro in tomato broth. I know I wil enjoy it on a warm summer day ( I tried it on a rainy day) . The other dishes we had were ok, nothing wow, nothing disastrous. Service was very good. Satisfied overall."}
{"text":"Always a great time. Anytime we have out of town family we have to stop in to get great Mexican food.  Also visited the location at Odysea.. super cute too!!"}
{"text":"Prices are listed different on the menu then what is Actually charged. When I asked the waitress why the prices were different she said oh well the menu has changed over the past few months. If that is the case, then update the menu on the internet. How many customers are also being charged more then what was consumed. Lucky i checked the bill.   Was charged for more alcohol then we had.   Food was average at best.   It's not about the price discrepancy it's about the service and the lack of professionalism in handling the matter."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place when we are craving chips & salsa and/or want to relax outside with a cold beer.  This patio is amazing...you get the feeling you're in Mexico (at least until you hear a pack of Harleys cruising by out front - it is in Cave Creek, after all!)  We love that the chips come with 3 salsas - the hubs and I don't usually like the same thing, so this satisfies us both!  The mild is my personal favorite and he loves the salsa verde.    They used to have a kick-ass plate of nachos, but they took it off the menu (wasn't sophisticated enough, apparently)...though it is sometimes available during happy hour.  We also love the Spinach Queso, but that's only available at Dos.  Pollo Fundido is our usual dish and friends love the Fajitas.  My mom still raves about the Sopa Albondigas she had 2 Christmases ago!  The variety of Margaritas is good too.    We love taking visitors here for the obligatory Mexican meal everyone wants to have when they travel to Phoenix.  There may be places with better/more authentic food, but you can't beat the ambiance."}
{"text":"Food ok, terrible margaritas that lack alcohol! Taste is weak and like mixer. Atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"We are weekly customers of the El Encanto in Cave Creek and love their food but most of all the customer service. The owners are very friendly! This location just isn't the same experience. The manager was very rude and non verbal he seemed irritated to be working. Knowing the owners this would be unacceptable to them. Our waiter was attentive and very friendly! If I were the owners I would be more present at this location as it is killing the brand and I would fire the manager. The food was exactly the same but the salsa tasted weird and the chips were stale. Maybe a little more attention on this location to get it up to par on the brand."}
{"text":"El Encanto is one of those old-time restaurants of Arizona. As Durant's Steakhouse, McAlpine, Tee Pee, Sugar Bowl, Red Devil, all have roots in Arizona dating back decades.   The food at El Encanto is good overall, with a few small overlooked details. First, the Carnitas can be a bit on the fatty side. Second, when the food arrives, don't expect it all to be served at the same time. I was dining the other evening at El Encanto, a table of 5, it took 3 trips to serve us all, over the course of 5 minutes.   The margaritas tend to be a bit thin as well, they need to adopt a recipe that requires more then a margarita mixer and tequila. Fresh lime juice is always a great place to start!  I do enjoy the space itself, very relaxing, great restaurant to go and chill with friends. The menu has had an overhaul in the past year, reducing it to a fraction of what it was. My advice, expand the menu to not include just the Sonora stuff (tacos, enchiladas, etc) but add some items that you can't get on every corner in Phoenix. Overall a slightly above average experience."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch. The Pollo Fundito was excellent! The staff were all great and we enjoyed watching the ducks and turtles. Would definately go back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times before, taking out of town guests for a unique Mexican dining experience.  Last night we were extremely disappointed with our dinner.  Three of our guests had the fried fish tacos, which were small and without much flavor, even after ordering additional sauce.  The Plato Mexicano had a tamale which was dry and left uneaten by our guest.  I had the Pollo Asado, which also was extremely dry, accompanied by grilled vegetables which were raw, barely warmed and without flavor.  After spending over $100 on a poor dinner with average service, we have no intention of returning."}
{"text":"Went with our motorcycle group today.  Was very busy, being Biketoberfest Sunday and all, but our 20 minute wait went by quickly watching the ducks and turtles in the indoor pond.  The service from Jessica was wonderful and the food was So Delicious.  The husband and I split two meals, we shared the Carne Asada Tacos and the Red & Green Tamales.  They were so wonderful.  Everyone at our table loved everything they ordered, I don't think there was a thing left on our plates.  This was my first visit, but it will not be our last!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the blended margaritas. Best in town. I've been going to El Encanto for years and it seems like the portions have shrunk and some of the meals are basic. Last night was the Fajita salad with vege' and it was very bland with a small serving of grilled vege's on top. Not much to brag about on that choice. Good salsa choices with the chips, so that helps."}
{"text":"Busy for a Tuesday in the summer Good food good service good drinks They accommodated a 13 top with no reso  I'd recommend it"}
{"text":"There's so much to love about this rustic place. The outdoor patio is so relaxing & it's nice to just watch the swans & ducks in the small pond. The black birds are having a good time too watching the customers below them, just waiting for us to get up so they could swoop down to snatch a chip. Speaking of chips, they are nice & thin but this time they weren't warm, even when we asked for fresh ones, a pity. The 3 salsa's they put on the tables are all delicious, my favorite is the avocado green chili. We always order the Carne Asada Chimi, the steak is perfectly marinated & tender, it's diced with peppers & onions & there is a lot of it in the chimichanga. We get it topped with their excellent fundido sauce & I'm happy to write that they put a lot of sauce. The refried beans are better than most places in Phoenix & the rice IS better than anywhere else. This place is definitely worth the drive. The only bad thing for me is that they have Coke products & we are Pepsi people. Sometimes you can get a good Coke mix on tap & that was true with the regular Coke but that was not so with the diet Coke, it was a little flat. The fried ice cream was an ample portion & made with cinnamon ice cream & had strawberries on top but the shell was too chewy & tough for me, I would like to see Cinnamon Toast Crunch used as the shell instead of Corn Flakes because it's crunchier & tastier too."}
{"text":"Our server (in the bar) was friendly and attentive. The food was good, not great.   While there are some really nice aspects to this place...it always leaves us wanting just a bit. I think that it mostly lacks intimacy."}
{"text":"One of the best carne asada burros I've had in a while. The staff was awesome & service was quick! Great bar with a wide variety. Sat outside which had a beautiful view! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Been here several times with family and just friends. Always order the frozen ritas....they are good and strong! If you need to find a great place to take kids this is it....very relaxed outside seating with plenty of animals to keep them entertained. They get to feed the ducks in a designated area as well. Service can be hit or miss so can't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has raved about this place on and off for the almost two years we've been going out so one day we grabbed a couple and drove on up with a birthday being the excuse for coming here. (Excuse so not needed by the way, a fact that I now know!)  There's indoor and outdoor seating and naturally we sat outside. There's a lovely duck pond filled with ducks, obviously, and some geese in the center and while it does smell a bit pond-ish it is worth it. The back of the menu informed me that the decor tries to capture the style of Mexican restaurants and I'll have to take it's word for that as I wouldn't know from experience.   The food is glorious! I had the Pollo Fundido and I HIGHLY recommend it. I have never tasted anything so good. After dinner we informed our waitress that it was our friend's birthday and she told us she'd be back with some free deep fried ice cream. Now, usually when a restaurant gives a free dessert for birthdays they're on the modest side but what came to our table was MASSIVE and way more then enough for four people to split.  If you're ever up in the area and looking for a nice atmosphere with good food then give El Encanto a try."}
{"text":"Shredded Pork burro was only $7.99 and just enough food to be filling. The tacos and burritos here are big and they don't skimp out on the amount of meat inside. Plato mexicano was a good option to have two different things at once (beef taco and enchilada) also just spicy enough. Deep fried burrito looked like the biggest item out of all we got and it was good. I enjoyed the green salas most of all when the complimentary basket of tortilla chips came out. The place was not too busy and we were able to sit out on the patio near the duck and turtle pond on a very hot day thanks to the misting fans. All 3 of us left happy, full, and pleased with our experience. Can't complain about the price if you pick the right things."}
{"text":"Atmoshpere was good and the food was mediocre at best. Should have ordered the fajitas. They smelled awesome."}
{"text":"This restaurant has come to set the bar for our family when it comes to Mexican food.  The atmosphere is great both inside and out, the staff is always so friendly; table is usually frequented by a manager on duty asking how everything is.  We love their tacos; the meat is delicious, taco shells made fresh.  They serve you 3 options of salsa with chips as a starter and all 3 are wonderful in taste.  We've gone a few times on Sunday to check out the brunch, but we've never really been impressed with that, so we still just order off the menu.  This is a stop for us at minimum once a month."}
{"text":"Expensive Gringo Mexican food.  Saving grace is the setting.  Wonderful pond with ducks in the middle of the facility.  Go for the beauty of it, not for the \"Mexican\" food.  They seem to cater to the Cave Creek tourist \"semi cowboy\" trade."}
{"text":"We went on a night when it looked like it was going to rain, so I was nervous because we were sitting outdoors.  Luckily, the rain never came, and we were able to enjoy one of the few cooler summer nights.  This was actually my second time here.  We came here because we were with children, and watching and feeding the ducks can be very entertaining for kids.  The food and drinks were good.  The whole experience was great, except for the fact that I had to watch children throwing food at ducks (do parents parent anymore).  There should be some type of rules of the restaurant on how to behave around the pond.  The children there were a bit out of control.....otherwise, great experience."}
{"text":"Very rude,  non considerate won't go there again and be treated that way. Don't take a large group they won't let you in. Too far to drive to be turned away."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying that the food is amazing. My 2 star rating is the atrocious service we received last night.  The restaurant hours said that they were open til 10 pm on Sundays. We arrived at 8:40. When we walked in our flustered hostess (there were only about 5 tables in the restaurant) didn't even greet us, just said, \"Our kitchen closes in 20 min.\" Lovely way to start off the meal. When we were seated our drink order was taken by a nice gentleman. The drinks were brought to us by a woman who looked as though by us sitting in her section we were doing her a disservice. I have been in the service industry for 10 years so I can handle mediocre food but bad service is a deal breaker. We ordered our apps and then about 10 min later ordered our entrees. 20 min after we ordered our apps everything arrived all together. The portions are pretty large there so we weren't too pleased that everything was brought out at the same time and would unfortunately get cold.   I'm not one to complain cause I know how it is to deal with people that can't be pleased but this made me want to literally ask our server if someone had just died because of the attitude she had.   I cant really say that 'Id return. This place is 45 min away and I don't wanna waste my hard earned money at a place where they couldn't care less how their staff treats the patrons.   Horrible service. Horrible hostess. Disorganized. Good food."}
{"text":"We just had a pre-wedding dinner for 120 guests at El Encanto, and everything was perfect! We knew the food would be wonderful, but everything else...decor, bar set-up, was right on the money. We also truly appreciated the well-trained and incredibly hospitable staff. Thank you Cyndi and all."}
{"text":"Beyond disgusting!!! Ducks ... yes feathered, pooping ducks have free reign of the place!  A health hazard beyond measure. Health Department... WHERE ARE YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Makes for a fun evening. Cool building with walled courtyard surrounding big duck pound and semi-outdoor dinning. Very good quality food - lots of variety."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere El Encanto has to offer. The pond rocks. My wife and I love the romantic setting and I believe it has received numerous \"most romantic restaurant of the year\" awards.   The food is always top notch and meets/exceeds our personal expectations. The only reason I didn't give it 5 (WHICH I TOTALLY WOULD) was because I can't stand dining on the patio with all the birds. My fear of birds makes the dining experience a little trickier and every so often you see me jump up a little in my seat as a bird has just walked over my feet. UGGGGGHHHHH...  In winter, they put out the patios heaters which is always a pretty neat experience...weather permitting of course.  Anyhow, my wife and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Each time I visit El Encanto I am always very pleased with the service and most importantly the food. This place is a must visit."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service and charming atmosphere. The kids loved the ducks and turtles!!"}
{"text":"I love their patio and brunch buffet ! This is a great spot to stop and and enjoy great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and the best margaritas in town.    This is Not a pet friendly restaurant, neither is El Encanto Dos on Carefree Hwy."}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Atmosphere is loud, fun and well, you just don't get many Mexican restaurants that feature a pond in the center complete with ducks and turtles.  So in that respect, the atmosphere adds to the overall rating of this place"}
{"text":"Eating pollo fundido  and a chicken bone jabbed me in the mouth. They say they cook the whole chicken and sometimes bones are missed. BEWARE The manager would only offer a free dessert. Then they just took it off. Chicken very dry and over cooked. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 10 years. Best food??  Absolutely not, but top 5 in Phoenix. Best ambience?  Absolutely.  Best service??  Absolutely.  The combo= can't be beat in the phoenix area!!"}
{"text":"Wow, just so pleasantly surprised!  Doesn't look like much from the outside, but whenyou walk in you can immediately see how beautiful and old it is! The interior pond, the glass, the flamenco dancer and guitarist. Simply lovely. Service was perfect and they were busy. I just loved the Chicken Mole."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my sister here for dinner on her visit.  They have a duck pond! I love duck ponds, how Blair Waldorf! The setting is a spanish style- tile and colorful with indoor and outdoor seating.  I am sure it is very nice in the fall/winter but it was 109. Plus, the duck pond is cute, but smelled a little like the water at an amusement park, thus we opted for inside seating with a view of the ducks.  The food was fantastic and everyone was happy. The Tamales (chicken and veggie) were flavorful and had different sauces. They were huge though! So was my sister's chicken burrito. Very classic and well done. My husband had the carnitas (so I did not sample) but he was very pleased.  We will go back for sure!  Service was just ok."}
{"text":"Placed a take out order with Danica, was told it would be 20 minutes. When I arrived the food wasn't ready. She took my order again, then disappeared in the back for a while. When she returned, I was told just a few more minutes...30 minutes later. Got home to enjoy a quiet Valentine's dinner only to find out she screwed up my order. When I called, I was told I could come back and get the correct order. Thank you Danica. I know...you are really sorry. Lousy customer service."}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic Mexican food that was delivered quickly by informed servers. Ambiance was excellent. Margarita was prepared well.  Kids loved their food and all the portions are quite generous. All good things to say!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The atmosphere is great. When you walk through the entrance they have a big pond with ducks, swans, turtles and even an owl. You can even feed the animals some pellets you buy at the counter. You can choose to sit outside by the pond or indoors. The service is amazing and the food is wonderful!!! They start you off with chips and three different flavored salsas, and the size of the meals are large enough to satisfy the biggest appetite. It may be a bit pricy buy I think its worth it. This is one of my favorite places to eat. Also they make terrific pomegranate margaritas!!! So if you're ever in the area I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fish Tacos: 1 Star; Restaurant: 4 Stars  We decided to check out some shops in Cave Creek Sunday afternoon and thought this place looked like a nice spot for lunch. We started with two DOS XX while we waited for a patio seat.   After being sat, they came with the chips and salsa's. I LOVED the chips. I liked the choice of salsa's, but good thing Dave quickly tried the green one because it had avocado (allergy alert!). It would have been nice if they asked if we had been there before and explained the salsa's. The reds were good. We ordered a small portion of fish tacos (grilled) and the Carnita's. The small portion of the fish tacos was one taco, rice and beans, which I thought would be plenty.   When the food came, I was disappointed with the taco. The piece of fish was about 2\" long and 1/2\" think...skimpy!  it was this small piece of fish in a tortilla, the cabbage was on the side. The only sauce they served with it was a cilantro butter, which I asked for on the side because I am not a huge fan of cilantro. It was ok, I did try some on the taco. I created my wimpy taco and tasted it. It had decent flavor, but I really wasn't getting into it. Of course I ate the whole thing. If you read my other reviews, I like the fish deep fried, and that wasn't an option.   It was served with black beans w/melted cheese and rice. I am not a bean fan, and I am less of a fan of black beans; however, these were good. I did eat some. Now, I really enjoyed the rice - it had flavor!   I also had a Carnita - good flavor, not excellent, but definitely good!     The service was great. I wasn't a fan of the facility layout; however, I did like the decor and the 'private booths' along the pond. They have a nice 'family story' that I would love to re-write as a marketing person and I would like to try some other dishes on the menu, so we will probably be venturing back another time. Plus - I did love those chips!"}
{"text":"Skip the buffet. It sucked. I saw several people go in and look then come out shaking their heads.  My friend wanted breakfast so we got it. But it really was mediocre. Haven't got sick yet fingers crossed. I do go here often with out of town guests because it is a fun place with the pond etc. but never again the buffet"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner tonight with my family and was sat next to a table of drunks who used foul language the entire dinner. The wait staff apparently felt no need to address the behavior, so we ended up leaving early.  Not a good spot for families at all. If you want to experience a biker bar vibe, this is your place. If you happen to be going to dinner with your family, find another place in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"I used to eat at El Encanto a lot years ago, and when a buddy invited me to go with him to Cave Creek shopping for a Mexican style Bistro table, I said \"only if you treat me to lunch at El Encanto!  Unfortunately, lunch was a disappointment. They seated us at a table in the direct sun (it's January, and the hostess said \"so you can enjoy the warm sun\"). The problem was that the sun was at an angle that blinded us so we requested to be moved. Our waiter took our order, then the hostess moved us to a perfectly good table.  But it seems that our waiter at the original table was not happy about giving us up to the waiter for the new table, and while that argument ensued, we had no waiter. After what seemed like forever, I motioned to the waiter waiting the table next to ours and asked if he knew who our waiter was. He told me that the original waiter would be waiting on us, and I told him that so far no one has waited on us. He said tersely \"So what is it that you need?\"  I said \"some silverware and water would be a nice start\". He grabbed silverware, napkins and water glasses from a nearby table and said \"don't shoot the messenger\" to which I said \"I don't want to shoot anyone, I just want standard service\".  Our food did show up, and later our waiter showed up.  We ordered:  - Large Guacamole (to share) - Quesadilla with chili strips (my buddy) - Chili Relleno with Carne Asada (me)  The guacamole was actually quite good, even if it is a bit over priced. The Quesadilla was not a Quesadilla at all, but a cheap cheese crisp and not really even a good Cheese Crisp at that. The Carne Asada that came with the Chilli Relleno was good, but the Poblano was filled with mashed potatoes! (yep, mashed potatoes). I guess it was the Irish-Mexican version of the Chili Relleno?  Overall we managed to pay $40 for an $8 lunch, and an overall bad experience.  As it turns out, I will be going to Cave Creek several times in the coming weeks. As it turns out I will not be dining at El Encanto.  Anyone know of a good place to eat in Cave Creek?"}
{"text":"Horrible food and service! Luckily, they are the only Mexican restaurant in town or they would be out of business. I've been twice and every time the service gets worse. Your local Mexican drive thru has better food."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Restaurant was not busy and my group of 8 was told we could not sit together inside or outside. Hostess was rude and so was the heavy 50ish manager who claimed she was also the owner (I seriously doubt it).  We were all astonished at the treatment we received when simply asking to be seated together.  Quote from the manager \"some people are just not a good match for a restaurant.\"   Seriously?  Stay away!  Read the other reviews."}
{"text":"Food was quite good and came out from the kitchen quickly.  The service was good, no problems.  Good value for the money! We would eat here again."}
{"text":"What a nice place to decompress and have a great meal. The tamales are fresh and flavorful. The enchiladas in mole sauce were really tasty. The flan was creamy. The waitress was helpful and there when we needed her. Go you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Love El Encanto! They have delicious food! Try anything, they never disappoint"}
{"text":"There are so many mixed reviews on this long-standing Cave Creek restaurant/landmark (or tourist trap, depending on how you see it), that I wasn't sure what to expect when I went there for lunch about three weeks ago. Would there be duck poo on my chair? Would I be attacked by giant swan in heat? Is the place really run by lollygagging teenagers?   To be perfectly honest, I spent most of the time feeding the ducks with my two-year old nephew, who became ecstatic when he saw the pond and wildlife. But during the short time I spent sitting at my table, actually eating my lunch and interacting with the (yes, very young) waitstaff, I can say that I experienced no major indignities (actually, no indignities at all). I went on a Wednesday during the busy lunch rush, and I have no major complaints about the service or food. The hostess quickly accommodated our request to be seated outside, our waiter was polite and attentive, and although the food certainly doesn't reinvent the wheel, it was standard Mexican comfort food, in all its yellow cheese glory. I wouldn't call El Encanto a foodie destination, but a perfectly nice place to consume cheesy lunch calories if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is wonderful. My husband calls it Gringo Mexican, but that's ok. It tastes great!"}
{"text":"First night of vacation and it got off to a nice start with dinner at El Encanto.  Margaritas were tasty.  They provided 3 different salsas which we liked. Our daughters split chicken fajitas and really enjoyed them.  My wife and I split a sampler platter.  Chicken Fundito was good, green tamale was good and as was taquitos. Didn't care for the beef tamale.  Sat inside, along the pond, nice setting."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere, very relaxed and open and airy.  We had lunch, Plato Mexicano, and chicken and beef tacos.  Very mediocre, not seasoned, in short---bland.  Great friendly service by Francisco, our server and the great surroundings, salvaged the day."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Salsa and guacamole are amazing!"}
{"text":"Went to El Encanto last night.  We started going there 12 years ago and back then the food was good but over the last few years (going maybe twice a year) it has gotten decidedly worse. Even though our last few experiences were poor we decided to try again hoping they were simply bad nights for the restaurant.  Unfortunately this trip was no better.  The chips served were cold and tasted like the oil needed to be changed.  I ordered a plato burro which was tasteless considering the sauce poured over top and the beef was chewy.  The tortillas was also dry and chewy.  My wife had the chilli relleno con pollo.  The chili was undercooked and tasted raw, chicken was overdone, my daughter ordered a bean burrito which she complained about the tortillas being dry and chewy, nothing special but it cost us $14 for the bean burrito with a side of beans and rice.  My other daughter had the pollo fundido which she said was okay. Should have clued in when I ask the waiter what he would recommend and the only thing was the polo fundido.  He said 75% of the patrons have that.  After trying other dishes I understand.   They forgot our appetizer of stuffed jalapenos so we cancelled them when the entrees were served.  Waited 45 minutes from order to entrees and they were not that busy. I used to recommend this place.  Have they changed owners? It seems their attention to detail and quality has gone down and the prices have gone up. Their menu mentions awards from 8-10 years ago.  No way would they get those now.    Not going back and that is a real shame.  Pains me to see what used to be a good establishment go downhill.  Don't waste your time.  There are many better choices for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Anytime I bring visitors North, this is the place we take them. GR8 for lunch - outdoor patio with fun, family friendly atmosphere.  (see below: BIG DUCK POND with turtles too!).  Fun diversion & pit-stop :-)"}
{"text":"10-15 min wait not bad at all but,when the waiter comes back after you had placed your order and finished the basket of chips to tell you that is going to be another 10 mins for the cheese crips and 30 mins for the meal. We were ready to leave but, we wait just a bit more and after demanding the cup back from my wife for a refill that they ran out of so the last straw. I told the waiter we were leaving and I would pay for the pops thinking he would say don't worry about it  sorry for the delay. He ran a bill for the drinks and chips, glad I didn't order a second basket. Big zero in my book."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. Best Mexican around!!Have tried many of the menu items and never been disappointed  Today the kids menu was perfect for our two young boys.  The chips at the bar are wonderful and we all love the three different salsas.  The steak burro was fabulous and the special of the day was delicious .  Great ambiance:  so much fun watching the fish, turtles and birds!  We will be back ASAP!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the fist time today.  Like just about every other reviewer, I enjoyed the atmosphere.  Having just moved here from Virginia, we've missed ponds, turtles, geese, etc so it was fun to see a little taste of what we're used to enjoying.   I also agree that the food is not terribly exciting.  I ordered a salad.  The description on the menu boasted avocados, tomatoes and cucumbers.  The entire salad was a large amount of lettuce, beans and cheese topped with 2 small slices of a tomato, about 1/16 of an avocado and 2 small slices of a cucumber.  So yeah, basically I paid $10 for lettuce and black beans garnished with the aforementioned.  I was disappointed.  I would have mentioned this to our waitress, but she didn't really hang out long enough to hear anything.  In fact, we had to flag down another restaurant employee a couple of times when our drinks were empty.  Water cups are already on the table before you are seated and they are placed rim-down.  Firstly, I do not think this is very sanitary because restaurant tables are not clean (they are usually wiped \"clean\" with dirty rags).  Secondly, there was something nasty and sticky on the table because I had to use a decent amount of force to turn over my glass as it was stuck to the table.  I just wanted to drink water but I ordered soda just so I wouldn't have to drink out of that cup.  The bathrooms are a bit icky and since they say that restaurant bathrooms are indicative of the cleanliness of the kitchen, I had to force myself to not think about it as I was eating.  Ew.  It was fun to eat at El Encanto because of the atmosphere.  I probably would only go back if someone else wanted to go, but I certainly wouldn't return on my own.  Cute, they just need to clean up a bit and better honor the descriptions on the menu!"}
{"text":"Overall: I was extremely happy with this place. Good service, very friendly even though they were very busy, but it was a Sunday afternoon so I can't blame them of course. The environment is absolutely beautiful, I love the little lake and ducks and the people in the restruant were all very lovely people. I will definetly be back to bring my other family members along. The food was very fresh (I had shrimp tacos) and it was very good. Two tacos made me full. Prices? I wouldn't say they are over-priced, for people saying they are over-priced, this is standard for Scottsdale, even though this is Cave Creek area, a lot of us from Scottsdale are very close. :) I forgot to add we had to wait 25 minutes for our table, but they did warn us ahead of time, it was worth the wait. :)"}
{"text":"If I stick to margaritas I don't get sick. That should say it all."}
{"text":"Thank you Terry for remembering us from the past! We loved that you remembered us! We are customers to your cave creek and fountain hills locations so to learn of one in Scottsdale so close to us was a treat! The food was fantastic and all our favs on the menu! You will be seeing us a lot! We will spread the word to the locals!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem with my partner 1 hour before closing and the restaurant was packed! Staff was friendly and service was good even though closing time was approaching quickly (I'm sure they were ready to go home). The food was amazing!!! I ordered the pollo fundido and would/will definitely get it again. The best Mexican food I've had to date. I can't wait to try more of their menu"}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere here.  Outside seats were taken but we were okay going inside because we still had a view.  We stopped here after horseback riding for some beer and shrimp tacos.  We were not disappointed.  It was simple, fresh and delicious.  Chips and salsa hit the table right when you sit down.  We just hung out a bit and headed across the street the shop.  We were in desperate need of corona and tried to give our bev order to the chip guy who was very confused by us LOL so yeah just wait for your server because they are not one in the same.  Crunchy tacos are handmade and slightly puffed and crispy, they are perfection!"}
{"text":"We go here about once a week. Love the Pollo Fundito and Carne Asado Relleno ... oh! and of course the frozen house margaritas. There aren't many good Mexican restaurants in this part of town, and I'd say this is one of the best up here. The ambiance, with the pond and trees, make it very nice as well."}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying I'm not a fan of Mexican food, but we went here specifically for the Chicken Fundidos which we had sampled in the fall at the Taste of Cave Creek. They are so delicious!  Even more delicious at the restaurant with its Mexican ambiance, and its stellar outdoor patio!  A reminder to self, though . . . don't overdo it on the chips!   This place isn't keen on reservations unless you call a couple hours ahead.  I called earlier in the day and they told me I'd have to call back. When I called back two hours beforehand, they said the couldn't accommodate a party of 2 until 8 pm. That was too late for us, so we thought we would just try to get in without a reservation, and if not, find another local restaurant. We arrived at 6 pm and there were tables galore -- inside and out!!!  I guess they all cancelled?  The service was prompt, but we felt rushed through our meal . . . maybe it was because they were expecting another crowd that might not show up!  So with that experience, it knocked a star off what could have been a really 4 star review!"}
{"text":"45 minute lunch wait on a Sunday, go Hawks! House margarita on the rocks was very good! Chips are a 4/5, salsa came in a variety of 3; mild, medium and hot. All three salsas were good (although not made at the table like the very authentic restaurants). Wife ordered the steak fajitas (4.5/5) and the flour tortilla are a 5/5. I had the camarones habanero (mild) but very good (4.6/5). Chicken quesadilla with grilled (not shredded p chicken good (4/5). Kids meal, cheese quesadilla was good which came with a soft drink. We also asked for a smoke of their mole' sauce, which I would look for next time. It had a very nice smokey/sweetness to it."}
{"text":"This place is down to earth. Staff real friendly. I recommend the extra 10 minute wait to sit outside. My boys watched a large water bird of some sort swoop down and catch a fish in its mouth right in front of our table. It was pretty awesome. The fajitas are the best I have tasted locally in a long while and the portion size enough for two adults."}
{"text":"And to think I loved this place as a tourist. Whenever I'd visit Phoenix I'd eat at Encanto. Now that I live here, you can't pay me to go. The food is average at best -- especially considering the prices -- and the duck pond is nothing short of disgusting.   Besides, if you have kids (like I do) you're almost required to take them to feed the ducks which means you're walking through what the ducks (ahem) leave behind. Multiply that times 100 and imagine what the restaurant's floor is covered in. I'm just saying."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here the food was really a disappointment.  Because the restaurant was busy, I gave them a little slack.  But after going there two additional times (a friends idea to return not mine) I have decided that the only good thing about this place is the atmosphere.  The food on each occasion was subpar and not worth the money.  This is really sad to say because I really want to like this place.  It has a great atmosphere that could make this place the best (if only the kitchen could match the atmosphere).  Utterly disappointed"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service! Jammy was a fantastic waitress and we did not wait long for our food at all."}
{"text":"Food was good. I will give it that. But the service needs some work. My family were one of three tables. It took them about 10 minutes to come and get our drink orders. We did get to order quickly- as we did so when the drinks were delivered. But after we ate we waited about 7-8 minutes for a box- luckily the manager walked by and gave us boxes- as our server was at the bar talking to another server. Our server made eye contact with me several times and still did not acknowledge us. We waited about 15 minutes after receiving our to go boxes and still- no check or drink refills. So we walked up to the host stand and requested our check. The host happily took care of it- and our server still sat at the bar, not finishing our tab out."}
{"text":"Blech, yuk, really??  Well, I had family visiting from Europe and made a list of places that I'd definitely want to take them.  Penciled in at number 22 was this place - a charming restaurant in a charming town that I'd often taken out of town guests over the years.  Big mistake.  It was terrible.    Parking was in the very, very back as street vendors had taken over the parking lot selling what my dad affectionately calls UBS (useless bunch o' shite).    Once we got through this, we put our name in for a table.  We were told it would be a 30 minute wait, and it was.  Service was great, but beware of the bill padding and mediocre, at best, food.  There were 4 adults and 2 kids and our lunch was $100.  I had the chicken parcel thingys which were terrible and around $11. When hubby ordered fish tacos, they asked, \"fish tacos with rice and beans?\"  he said, \"sure.\"  (ADD $4)  My kids ordered juice with their meals (ADD $4) - seems the kids meals come with milk or soda, not juice.  Sister-in-law orderd enchiladas (ADD $4 - $2 for each one to add chicken), Other sister-in-law ordered fajita salad with tortillas on the side (ADD $4 for tortillas).  YOu get the point, I'm sure :-)    However,  if the food was good, all of the ridiculous upcharges would have been bearable.  It wasn't.  Mediocre food at best."}
{"text":"Ate at El Encanto on 9/25 for lunch with the wife.  We came here because we heard about the great atmosphere and with 3.5 stars it was actually one of the higher rated Mexican places in North Scottsdale (which I still find weird).  Oh Yelp how you let me down!!!!  3.5 stars - if you stuck to chips, salsa and bottled beer I could understand that rating but my meal was left 2/3 uneaten (appetizer and entree).  The setting is unique but is far from special if you are not sitting next to the interior pond.  We were stuck far away from the pond next to a dirty server station and rusty spigot and hose.  When we asked to move \"nothing else was available\" . . .   For an appetizer I ordered the Queso Guillermo.  The only thing accurate about the menu description was \"hot bubbling . . .\"  The add-on crispy beef Machomos was truly bad - the two bites I had you had to soften it in your mouth for 30 seconds before you could chew it - like really old beef jerky.  The cheese was stuck to the bottom of the skillet and the oil had separated leaving a wet, greasy mixture of chiles onions and tomatoes.  I hate being so negative but I really lost my appetite after this appetizer.  What really sent me over the edge was when the Guacamole arrived - a perfect ice-cream scoop of guacamole that must have been served and stored in a very cold refrigerator long before our order was placed because their were ice crystals in the tomato garnish.  The only thing positive I can say is that they serve cold beer . . ."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service and great ambience. Will definitely come back on my next trip to Arizona"}
{"text":"Neat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This place is like a trip to a non-petting zoo and aquarium and aviary while you dine on fairly decent Mexican food.  I was here for a late brunch and didn't wait at all.  I was near a window that right on the pond, and just about every turtle in the pond crawled out to come on over and see what the Rock was cooking and how I was enjoying it... no joke, see pic!  The ducks and geese were very active in the lagoon, showing off for all the diners, and it thrilled the kids to pieces.  The guacamole is decent and the 3 types of salsa you're given were all good in their own ways.    If anything, swing in here for the atmosphere.  I bet its awesome at night."}
{"text":"Fantastic unique atmosphere, good food and service.  Turtles and ducks in the lagoon are wonderful for exploring kids and romantic adults and what really makes this place. We come here frequently and for special occasions. Fun!"}
{"text":"A surprisingly limited menu, but what they serve is excellent. The cheese enchiladas are sublime. Top shelf margaritas too."}
{"text":"I've recently moved back west after 15 years in the east. In the east where I only found one Mexican restaurant that served, in my opinion, real Mexican food. I just had a fabulous meal in a fabulous place, El Encanto!!! I will go there many, many, many, more times. Go enjoy the wonderful atmosphere too."}
{"text":"We came on Sunday evening, when they had free flamenco guitar music and a flamenco dancer. They did a great show, though we seemed to be the only ones paying any attention. The music was outdoors on the patio, which is a beautiful.  The food reminded me of Chi-Chi's. They even have fried ice cream! The service was good and the food arrived quickly."}
{"text":"They were very accommodating to my needs and created my own plate.  But it took three attempts to get in, as every time I went they had closed early."}
{"text":"The outdoor space is gorgeous. Husband and I sat at the bar inside. Great margaritas made with the well tequila Sauza Gold. Unfortunately the bartender was unfamiliar with jalapeno margaritas or Titos vodka..also not interested in learning more about the request. I had the fish tacos, which unfortunately  the fish Mahi Mahi was overcooked. The bartender did offer to get me something else but I was stuffed on the Spanish rice and black beans. The rice, beans and salsa were good.  Overall the experience was ok. Even though the margarita was good, I would not go out of my way to revisit."}
{"text":"Update! We've come back and I've ordered the fish tacos again, and they were great. Maybe my previous review was an off day for them. Still highly recommend the frozen margaritas over the rocks. Had a great server and management was also very friendly as usual"}
{"text":"I love the shrimp tacos and the prickly pear margaritas.  I have learned to order the pitcher instead of the individual glasses as it is more economical."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Cave Creek and we were looking to find a great Mexican restaurant that was locally owned and had great food. El Encanto was the solution. First, I've got to say the restaurant itself is gorgeous. The building is old & charming. The patio area is amazing as there is a beautiful duck pond filled with with coy, turtles, birds and other fish.   The food was really good. I had the fish tacos and my husband and daughter had the carnitas plate. The food was flavorful and hot with the exception of the corn tortillas; which came out cold. The house margaritas were decent but not exceptional by any means. The service was the same. Overall, on a scale of 1-10 this is a decent 8.5 and we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good spot worth checking out if you're in town for a few days. Guacamole was decent, Plato de caranitas were very good and my girlfriend got the carne Assad which was great. Outside seating area was beautiful and live music"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Food is good, but customer service is lacking. Our hostess Trinity was so rude. She quoted us a wait, sat three parties who came in after us, before us. I overheard her on the phone and felt terrible for the people on the other line. She put such a damper on lunch and besides the long wait, not sure it was worth it."}
{"text":"Refried beans were dry, the tamale was dry with hardly any  meat in it and the chips...they were horrible as well. My wife sent her food back. Now keep in mind...while I take a restaurant for what it is aka Jack in the box, Taco bell...etc. This place was just horrible and expensive."}
{"text":"Great frozen margaritas and make sure you order the Pollo Fundido.  It's worth the trip up to Cave Creek."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, everyone was very friendly.  Margaritas were super. Ambiance was great, except for the high noise level."}
{"text":"Decided to check this spot out after seeing great reviews.  Went on a Sunday night and the place was super packed!  We decided to wait for a table but we were both starving and a spot at the bar opened up so we grabbed the seats.  It was an awkward bar setup with a pillar between the bartender and us but it didn't matter.  We were hungry.  I love animal friendly places but I'm giving this place 3 stars because it just felt a little dirty inside with the stagant water and ducks swimming around while everyone was eating.  I know it's an older building but it just didn't seem clean.  We walked in the front entrance which made it awkward to walk through the entire restaurant to the back hostess.  I got a vegetarian dish and the food was mediocre.  The rice and refried beans were blah and the grilled veggies were just bland.  Maybe this place isn't ready for vegetarian dishes but it was honestly nothing to get excited about.   The bartender was pleasant and prompt.  I just have lukewarm feelings about this place because on the initial cleanliness appearance.  I live in Cave Creek and prefer to eat up here but there are definitely better Mexican places if you drive a little further south.  Might come back and try to sit at a table, order a meat dish and give it another chance."}
{"text":"I'm a lifelong duck pond fan, so when I found out this was a restaurant centered around a pond, of course I couldn't resist.  We were in town visiting my parents and dragged them there. They were good sports. The food was just okay... I'm certain there is much more authentic Mexican around, and probably for cheaper. But for ambiance this place is unequaled.   The positive:  Ambiance -- Beautiful outdoor seating alongside the pond, which had lots of feathered friends. Indoor seating all seems to have a good view of the pond as well. A great place to hold a function.  The negative: There were quite a few blunders... Three of us got our food while my mom sat and waited... and waited. She probably had to wait 10 minutes, which got quite frustrating.  Meanwhile, my boyfriend and I took the first sips of our \"diet\" coke and both gave each other a weird look. \"Does this taste strange to you?\" \"Yes\" \"Me too\" ... waitress comes, insists she poured diet, but brings back a new pitcher. Well would you believe that, this one actually tastes like diet!  Beyond these blunders, this place is the only Mexican restaurant I have ever been to that charges extra if you go through your first basket of tortilla chips and decide you want more!   The salsas that come with the chips were pretty good, but the guac we ordered was not so good (kinda bland tasty and mushy). It came with a small pile of chips on the side. Seemed like they were teasing with just enough chips to get you to want more, so you'd have to pay extra.  The bottom line: Great if you have a group and want a fun setting or are dining with kids and want them to be able to enjoy the duck pond. Don't go for the food. And I wouldn't go often. But for a cool one-time experience definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks. Is it the best...maybe not but a super nice setting. Either get there early or expect to wait."}
{"text":"This IS a family favorite... It's one of those places you miss if you have not been there in awhile. Yes-pollo fundito is their most loved dish. Guacamole is good. Basic Rita's are decent. Property has declined over the years but suppose it adds to the atmosphere.  It is always wonderful to watch kids feed the ducks."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this place is top notch! I love the authentic surroundings. The food is always on point and priced fairly! Keep up the good work!  One of the best places in the area."}
{"text":"Duck pond in the middle of the restaurant? Need I say more? Awesome fundido and the best margaritas I've ever had."}
{"text":"Start off with a margarita in the air conditioned bar, because it's the coolest (temp) spot they have. If you don't know what a swamp cooler is (east coasters, this means you) you'll soon find out.  Back to drinks & food. Margs are great and the bartender was friendly while my friend and I waited for a table outside.  I love the tamales so we got an order of them and the combo chicken and steak fajita which were just ok. The chicken was a little dry and the steak while good was not cut in to easy to eat sizes and frankly making up your tortilla was not easy.  Get the margs & tamales and you're safe."}
{"text":"We like this restaurant more for the atmosphere. It's fun to bring out of town guests or large parties because you can sit outside by a pond with ducks. It has an old Hacienda feel to it which is nice for people not familiar with the Arizona desert. There is also a mariachi band that walks from table to table which adds to the ambiance. The food is pretty good but not the BEST Mexican food I have had. (I have had better Mexican at Carolina's) It's good enough though if you want to go somewhere romantic or fun for a large group. The service is always pretty decent as well. We're fans!"}
{"text":"Love this place...awesome food that starts with fantastic chips and salsa.  I haven't had anything I didn't like.  Reasonable pricing, great service, and a unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"What I love about El Encanto.  1. The ambiance. I have been coming here for years and I read some of the other reviewers comments about dining on the patio and flies or poor service. I have had both here. So I can see that you could have the misfortune of happening here when either of those are occurring, but do not let it deter you from trying again or trying for the first time. I have been to this restaurant more than 50 times and on the whole the service is above average with some experiences being excellent, and any flying nuisances have occurred maybe twice. In Phoenix, there ARE certain times of year that flies run rampant and are virtually unavoidable outside and are not at all a sign of a lack of cleanliness on the restaurants part. There is NO other place to sit than outside on the patio, inside feels dismal and like you are in a subpar mexican restaurant. My children go nuts for the duck pond and I happily dig in my purse for supplies of quarters as it buys me minutes of serenity to sip on my marvelous margarita. This alone is why I visit again and again. So let's talk about the margaritas.  2. The food. I have had dishes I love and dishes I hate and dishes that were just, well, meh. I agree that this is not \"authentic\" mexican food, but the pollo fundidos make up for that in taste. I ADORE their margies and I like theirs frozen. They are tart and strong and by the time I have had one and are a sip in to the second, the tranquility washes over me. The feeling like I have been exported to an exotic country (save the room full of sun visor wearing cave creek golfers in my immediate view) with my children gleefully dumping hand fulls of feed at the ducks just within my view and I know longer care ALL that much about the food that just got served. I much prefer the food at their sister restaurant along the carefree highway, El Encanto Dos. So here I typically stick to fajitas or fish to avoid the caloric heavyweight of the pollo fundido. I know fajitas are a cop out, but let's remember, I'm here for the margaritas and the duck pond."}
{"text":"You pay for the atmosphere, but don't expect great Mexican food.  Would not go back for the food.  Ordered their signature dishes, including the Pollo Fundido - nothing memorable and average at best."}
{"text":"Great Christmas eve dinner! Margaritas were ok, fajitas were excellent! Service was great. A fellow yelper recommended the guacamole... Stick with the chips and three tasty salsas... Especially the chipotle!"}
{"text":"Super big on atmosphere in cooler months, and still the best Pollo Fundido I've ever had in Phoenix.    This is where you take out of town guests."}
{"text":"Good food, great margaritas! Customer service was also good. I ordered the Pollo Fundido and it was AMAZING!! The pitcher of mango margarita is also good. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Pollo fundido not good, Garcia's on 35th Ave way, way better."}
{"text":"Unbelievably disappointing experience. We have been here several times and this may be the last. We were there for over 2 hours and  waited for a cold meal for 45 min."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Nothing special. Don't plan on coming back here. Tried and several times. Server made some smart ass comment to us that we were not wild and crazy. Hey be quiet I never asked for feedback. Wife had her new pants get ruined on bar chair."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get lunch in the Cave Creek area. The food is good and sitting on the patio with a margarita is great! The patio has a large pond inside the court yard with ducks and turtles. This is our favorite atmosphere out of the many Mexican food restaurants we have tried. We went in early February and it was a little cold out but it felt very nice still on the patio because of the heaters."}
{"text":"Came to this place by chance, the restaurant we wanted to go to is closed on Sunday's. (even though yelp said it was open) My son had been here before and said it has a cool atmosphere inside, he was right! It feels like you could be in Mexico! Nice live guitar music, great weather, good margaritas, cool pond and trees inside. The only problem is the food...it's not bad, but it falls short in a lot of areas, If you like authentic Mexican food this is probably not the place for you. This restaurant would be a five star place for me if they just elevated their food a few notches."}
{"text":"Second time here and equally disappointed as the first time. Food is tasteless, service is so-so, and I find the prices to be excessive. This is really a very touristy place to go in Cave Creek. If you want great Mexican in Scottsdale go to Los Sombreros, a family owned authentic place on Scottsdale Rd."}
{"text":"Ok food, good service. Wasn't bad just didn't stand out, I prefer lots of flavor on my Mexican food, and I thought most of what I ordered was more towards the bland side. The wife loved it though."}
{"text":"Oh, El Encanto...so much promise, so little delivery.  I chose this location for my in-laws to take me on a \"Bon Voyage\" meal because I had been to \"Dos\" and heard the ambiance was even better at the Cave Creek location. After eating here, I wasn't one bit sad that I was leaving Phoenix.  If interested, you can read my review of El Encanto Dos as well. Surprisingly, the reviews are almost opposite (you'd think they'd be similar if owned by the same people).  First look, I wasn't amazed. Of course, the pond and the ducks are great, but it produces demanding birds that the net over the pond can't completely prevent. We went early in the evening on a weekday, maybe right around 5pm and it was pretty empty. Our server was very attentive at first, but strayed a bit towards the end. I'm not going to say anything else about the service; I've only been there once and I'm hoping that bad service isn't a theme with the Encanto restaurants.  The margarita...I don't remember much about it, so I\"m going to say it wasn't memorable. The food was memorable, only in that it was such a bore. I got a quesadilla and could have gotten something more interesting/tastier at Denny's. In fact, I was really astounded at the boringness of the food. Everyone I was with at the table said that they thought the meal was lacking in a way.  This visit took place in mid-May 2010, and I'm not sure if they had just gotten a new cook, or had some other issue. That is the only time I've been there, so I can't testify to much...but when I go back to visit Phoenix, I won't be going to El Encanto."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a quick drink and a snack.  We got the quesadillas, guacamole, and some margaritas. They have a good frozen house margarita, which was a great way to help beat the heat.  The food was decent and hit the spot.  El Encanto is a huge place with a massive patio.  The patio can only be good for a few months a year given how hot it is in AZ, but it looked very nice."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and good Mexican fare. Have been there many times."}
{"text":"I had passed this restaurant dozens of time without knowing what magic was behind the plain building. I was very pleasantly surprised upon walking in at around 9pm on a Friday night to see ducks and turtles swimming around. The tables outside were filled with lovers, adding to the romantic ambiance of El Encanto. There was a older gentleman singing Spanish love songs while playing the guitar. It was like another world from the street that we entered from; it almost felt like a secret club for some reason. And I was happy to have found it.  Anyway, on to the food. I shared the pollo fundido with my other half. I wasn't TOO impressed, because I still think X Tapa Joe's has the best Pollo Fundido in town, but the yellow rice that accompanied the dish was superb. Usually, I am disappointed at the dry and bland Mexican rice that comes with entrees. Not here. It tasted like the yellow rice that I make, which is moist and rich in flavor. The margaritas were a bit too sweet but still okay. Overall, I thought it was a great place for a date night as it seeped with romance. I would love to try another dish sometime to give them a higher rating, but so far, the 3 stars I gave it seems right on point."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were good. They brought me three types. My steak tacos were solid. Girlfriend thought her grilled fish taco was really good. Sat at the bar where we received great service."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in north Phoenix. The pond with ducks is a beautiful backdrop while relaxing and dinning. The kids really love it too! (My personal favorite dish is the Pollo Fundito)  PS I once saved one of your turtles before he was injured by a car on Cave Creek Rd. I don't think he liked that I was helping him due to the fact that he peed on me as I was caring him back to the pond."}
{"text":"i tried the  Pollo Fundido based on the comments below & so did my girlfriend.  she'd had it b4 and loved it which i didn't know at the time.  it was REALLY dry.  i thought it was me but i looked up at her and said \"itsn't this kinda dry\"?  it tasted good and the sauce was excellent and so was the rice.   we complained, the manager came out, placated us with getting us more sauce (which was lukewarm) and that was it.  We still weren't happy and the bill came, they took one of them off.  FINALLY!!!  There were no excuses offered or any remedy the first time.  We were really disappointed and she more than me because that's why she chose this restaurant to celebrate my Bday.  Oh well...i've been here quite a few times and have always liked the food and atmosphere.  The chips were great and the salsa not bad."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! While we did not have a meal here, we did sit at the bar and had Salsa (3 types), and guacamole which was extremely good. The chips were light, freshly made and not greasy. The frozen Margaritas were some of the best I've had in recent history.  I definitely will eat there (not just have drinks) next time we visit Cave Creek. Can't give it five stars as we did not have any food"}
{"text":"There were mixed reviews on Yelp so we were hesitant to try it, but have now been 3 times.  We think it's very good food at a reasonable price.  Large portions too."}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is nice, a little grotto in town. And great for kids who like to watch and feed the ducks and turtles in the pond while you wait for table and food"}
{"text":"Pro: Atmosphere is very cool. Romantic lighting, and a duck pond. Food was tasty and reasonably priced. The sangria was a little on the dry side for my liking but the piña colada was great.  Con: strange, funky smell in bar area. Dried food on our table on patio."}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere of this restaurant! Tasty food and kind staff! Love coming here with my family! A nice restaurant to go to in the cave creek carefree area!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food we've found in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area since we moved here a few years ago.  Tried it initially based on a recommendation, and now El Encanto is where we take all of our out-of-town guests for a great meal paired with great ambiance.  My personal favorite is the pollo fundito.  Great flavor, great portion size.  I also really like the salsas that come out with the chips before the meal.  The first time I was there I wound up taking a container home.  We're always sure to get deep-fried ice-cream as a desert, too.    The pond in the center of the property is beautiful (except for the one instance we saw where a bunch of large geese all ganged up and attacked a small helpless duck...the wait staff did their best to save it).  Also, don't allow yourself to get seated in the back room of the restaurant.  No view of the pond, and a large loud clunky heater or a/c unit kills the ambiance.    We'll be back many more times I'm sure..."}
{"text":"This is our favorite date night spot. Love the atmosphere and the service is normally wonderful. We prefer to sit outside, but the inside is just as great. I always get the fajitas abd they are definitely big enough to split if you order extra tortillas. Love this place so much! Is a little pricey if you are wanting just a easy night out, but overall one of our favorite places to go in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Bleh. That's how I feel about my most visit to El Encanto this past weekend. The service and overall experience was a huge disappointment, which left a yucky taste in my mouth.   First of all, we had a reservation- unfortunately for our party of seven, we had to wait 30 minutes past our reservation to be seated inside, after requesting to sit outside. Now I know the restaurant can't help the fact that the patrons sitting at our table wouldn't leave after their meal was complete, but what the restaurant could have done would have been to come up with a solution faster than 30 minutes. We were finally sat in a mostly empty back room, with no ambiance, which felt awkward and unsatisfying. The restaurant manager was very friendly (kind of overly friendly) and offered to buy us guacamole as compensation. Had the guac been more flavorful and bigger this might have been nice, but instead was a very little consolation prize for the long wait and the disappointment of where we were sat.   The food overall wasn't great. No one LOVED what they got. We found the chips to be greasy and the salsa just off. I did like my tamales, but wasn't blown away. I really feel if we had gotten to sit outside our experience would have been better, but really the food is mediocre at best. There are plenty of good mexican restaurants in the valley, I will opt for one of them next time."}
{"text":"Yuck! We used to go to El Encanto all of the time but the last two times we had horrible food and was warm at best. My beef burro enchilada style was stuffed with more salsa than beef and there wasn't any melted cheese on top of the enchilada sauce. My daughter's Mahi-Mahi was so disgusting that she took one taste and left the rest. (Thank goodness for their chips and salsa; that was the only token star given). I will never go there again since it seems that this restaurant has continued to disappoint us."}
{"text":"This place had excellent Mexican food!!! The atmosphere is wonderful! The outside ponds with the ducks is really neat. This is a fun place to bring your kids as well. It's very casual. The enchiladas were excellent!! If you like Mexican food you must try this place. If you have out of town guest you just take them here, be sure to make reservations because this place stays packed!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Seating people out of turn. Not willing to accommodate a party of 7. I would avoid this place as the staffs unwillingness to give good customer service is an indication of the quality of food."}
{"text":"So this place has above average Mexican food, and great atmosphere.  Who could not love watching the ducks and turtles. Sometimes they have a live Mexican band as well. The food. Its pretty good. Maybe not the absolute best in Phoenix but definitely the best in Cave Creek. Food generally was good. And prices, pretty reasonable for Cave Creek or Phoenix for that matter. I definitely will go back and bring visitors."}
{"text":"We went to El Encanto on our first night in Cave Creek.  It was within walking distance of the resort at which we were staying.    The outside wall hides the beauty inside.  We were amazed at the ambiance hidden behind the concrete walls surrounding the restaurant.  There's covered indoor and outdoor seating around a huge pond.  You would never know you were in the middle of the desert.  Even inside (in the air-conditioning), we felt like we were outside, sitting along the pond with only a big glass window separating us!    The fresh salsa (3 kinds!) and chips that they bring you were delicious.  Nobody wanted the two spicy salsas, so I had them all to myself.  Mmm...    For my entree, I (and so did two others at my table) tried the Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole (Chicken Enchiladas with Mole sauce).  Everyone agreed:  the mole sauce was AMAZING.  It was the best I've EVER tasted.  It was so full of flavor that other mole sauces have, apparently, been lacking.  Now, no mole sauce that I ever eat in the future will be able to stand up against this one.  Sigh...    My one negative comment would be that I was a bit put off by the server's rudeness (or perhaps, lack of interest).  He seemed to do the bare minimum and nothing else.  When I asked him what the dinner specials were, he replied, \"I don't know.\"  Well, okay...   What he *should* have said was that it was only 4:30 (we got there early because we just flew in and were still on East Coast time) so their dinner specials didn't start until 5:00 and the chefs and/or management hadn't informed the wait staff yet.  The food and atmosphere were so perfect, though, that I can't even slight the restaurant's ratings for his lameness."}
{"text":"Unique ambiance - you can feed the ducks! I thought the food was pretty in line with Mexican food restaurants. My extended family enjoy going to this place as they live nearby."}
{"text":"After we ate there my husband ended up at Mayos ER with confirmed food poisoning!! Ugg!!!"}
{"text":"A co-worker suggested we visit this restaurant while in Arizona.  I can see why they make it a point to go whenever they are in town.  We sat inside but enjoyed a view of the pond and ducks.  My margarita was a little on the weak side but still tasty.  My fajita was very good, especially the black beans."}
{"text":"I like the setting with the pond and ducks and all but the food wasn't spectacular. Nothing really stood out. I ordered a pitcher of margaritas that cost 25$ and was half filled with ice which was a turn off. Service was good and the happy hour is ok with buckets of 6 8oz coronas for 5$.  I am not sure I would chose to sit on the patio where all the ducks and birds fly around dropping poo but you can sit inside and still have a good view if you pick a window seat. They had some live guitar music out side which was a nice touch. I might go back for happy hour but would probably go elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"I've lived in cave creek for 15 years and El Encanto  used to be a restaurant we are at weekly. I've seen the restaurant change over the last few years. El Encanto has always been slow service wise. Tonight was the first time we came for dinner in a few years with a large party and over an hour wait to be seated. Sorry your pollo fundido isn't good enough to make up for the horrible service. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere,  good drinks,  and fajitas were awesome.  Pollo fundido was dry (two of us ordered it and didn't like it). Chips and salsa are a highlight!"}
{"text":"El Encanto is a fun spot to take a out of town guest. It's located in the small cowboy town of Cave Creek. Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by large ducks frolicking in the central man made pond.  The food and service is decent. I love their margaritas and always order the pollo fundido. Cream cheese and chicken nestled in a deep fried tortilla topped with more cream cheese sauce.  By the way, this place is huge, it seems like every corner you turn they have slapped in an additional dining room. Also, if the weather is decent I recommend sitting al fresco."}
{"text":"Visited El Encanto with some friends for lunch the first time last week.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere.  We sat inside with a view of the pond and the ducks.  The service was good and the food above average.    The green salsa is fantastic with a wonderful flavor.  The chips are fresh and they are happy to refill as you request.  I ordered the carnitas which were terrific.  Others at the table had the carne asada, the fajitas and the pollo fundido.  Good reviews on the food from everyone.  Portions were generous and we all left with no room for dessert.  Great place for lunch or dinner.  The restaurant has a nice feel and  you certainly won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"This has been one of our favorite places to eat for many years! Once again, our entire family, 12, had a fantastic time. Also, Eric a manager there helped make my sons birthday very special by making a reservation for our group on a Saturday night, for the next day at noon!! Our 4 Grandchildren loved the beautiful pond with all the turtles and ducks, which also kept them entertained!! You will never be disappointed eating this delicious, authentic food!!"}
{"text":"El Encanto is such a fun place to be! We come very often!They have an amazing pond filled with ducks and turtles, and it's such a big place! The food is awesome as well. 3 different types of salads and their frozen margaritas are AMAZING! People complain about long wait times in their reviews, but it's a busy restaurant in the heart of Cave Creek, and a long wait should be expected! Definitely worth the wait when you order the Carne Asada Relleno or the Pollo Fundido! The staff is also so friendly and knowledgeable of all the menu items! Great service!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE EL ENCANTO!!!  Authentic Mexican restaurant located in North Phoenix (Cave Creek).  Awesome food, excellent sevice and a great atmosphere all come together for a wonderful dining experience!  If you are in the area it is worth the trip!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Food OK just average. Friends ordered Pollo Fundido & enjoyed it, but our Chicken Fajitas and Carnitas Burrito were DRY and not so flavorful. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Bartenders needed to pay better attention ... gave our drinks to another couple next to us and didn't even realize the mistake until we pointed it out. LAME!  Nice atmosphere on patio.   Very large restaurant and we heard manager on the phone calling servers to come in to work,  so service could get spotty.  Plenty of other places with better food and service, though perhaps you'll have to travel outside Cave Creek to find them.  We might come back here but only after trying the other restaurants in the area first."}
{"text":"Traveled to Scottsdale/Phoenix for business.  Asked for a great local place for mexican food and our host took us out to Cave Creek.    By far the best mexican Ifood  have had in a very long time.  The menu had a great variety, and out of my party of three we all had very different but equally tasty dishes.  I have to say..it was the best guacamole I have ever had.  Ever.    The only thing that could have made it better was an ice cold cerveza.. but alas.. it was a business trip and only lunch.    The only knock I have was the wildlife.  Although the birds, geese and ducks are nice and fun, the big goose poop on my bosses chair- although funny was slightly uncalled for.  I will be back to this gem during my next trip to Scottsdale.  I will of course ensure I add some cold beer and tasty tequila on the next stopover."}
{"text":"OK....  I wanted to like this place.  cool location, building, courtyard.  But the service was lacking and the food was not what we were expecting.   This is run of the mill Mexican food. Nothing more. Salsas were average.  Our table was dirty and the floor was also dirty.  The Fajitas were ok...  just lacking flavor and love.  Its a place you may want to try but I did not like it...  Its ok."}
{"text":"Ambience 4 Service speed 2 Food 5  I would love to return and be able to enjoy some more of the great dishes here when I have extra time to wait for the sluggish service.  It may have been due to the fact that there was a special event taking place in Butterfly Wonderland/Odysea Aquarium and they weren't prepared for extra diners.  I enjoyed the wonderful meal, the service, not so much."}
{"text":"If you ever go here, make sure and get the Pollo Fundido!!!  The best ever!!  And make sure and get the FROZEN margaritas, NOT the regular margaritas, because they are way stronger than the regular.  I love this place and would highly recommend it for a date, or a night out with some of your friends."}
{"text":"Took 15 mins just to be acknowledged. Then waited another 25 mins to be seated. Food took almost 40 mins to be brought to the table. Food is good, nice variety, a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"Every time I am in town; I visit here with my family. They're great to accommodate large groups and are very patient. The service, food quality and ambiance is what brings me back every time."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating there for over 20 years. Great service and great food. Love their salsa. A nice getaway in summer to sit outside under their misters. They have heaters outside unless its really cold in winter.   We just ate there yesterday and I am ready to go back soon..."}
{"text":"The Complete Lowdown: El Encanto Edition.   I live five minutes away and have been here countless times. Here is what you need to know:   -Ambiance: spectacular. El Encanto has a large outdoor and indoor seating arrangement decorated with authentic Mexican titles and trinkets. It is quite lovely and makes you feel as if you are in a Mexican village. For the full experience, I recommend sitting outside next to the pond or on the strip of indoor seating that has windows to view the pond. That way, you will get the opportunity to be enchanted by the pond creatures (adorable turtles and ducks) and to be entertained by the children feeding them. You will also be touched by the warming and relaxing sunshine overhead--glorious.  -Busy: Be aware and warned--weekends are busy. You may have to wait 30 minutes for a table and scrounge for parking, but it is all part of the fun, excitement, and liveliness of the experience. Grab a margarita at the bar to enjoy the wait!   -Food: every table is served chips and three sauces to start--all of which are very tasty. There is a standard red sauce, spicy chipotle sauce, and a green tomatillo sauce. Try the queso Guillermo for a starter--it is delicious. Being a health freak, I normally order the fresco salad or fish tacos. They are quite tasty but nothing mind blowing or fancy. If I am feeling indulgent, I go for the small portion of the cheese enchilada which comes with rice and beans. I recommend it.   -One word: Margaritas! I have tried nearly every flavor and would have to recommend the original, mango, or raspberry. You will not be disappointed. Just remember, they are strong so I would advise not having more than two--drive safely and responsibly!   -Service: I have experience the good, the bad, and the ugly. I would say 75% of the time the service is friendly and reliable. However, the more less than positive occasions I have been waited on by slow and standoffish servers.   All in all, I come here for the ambiance, margaritas, and convenience. It only gets better the more you come due to its charming and appealing qualities. There's no denying--me encanata El Encanto! It is truly a special place."}
{"text":"Sorry I went to Dos. The salsa was terrible , chili paste or Las Palmas red chili salsa with nothing added tasted like the spicy one. Regular salsa no flavor and the tomatillo one bland. Chimichanga was a burrito, mushy and brownish sauce, NOT red sauce. Rice was dry and flavorless . I've heard the one in Cave Creek went downhill too. A guest arriving this week and I think I'll skip El Encanto for CC Smokehouse where we are guaranteed great brisket, everything ! It's a shame what you've done to my favorite Mexican Restaurant , sad. If you have to raise the already not cheap prices to hire new chefs, cleaning staff, etc do it. It'd be worth it. I'd rather pay a bit more than eat the sub par food on dirty tables and filthy menus. What have you done?!"}
{"text":"Not sure if the heat we were feeling at breakfast was due to the near 100 degree weather at 9am or the spicy Huevos Rancheros from very unique El Encanto Mexican restaurant.  Yes its hot out but that shouldn't stop you from heading up to Cave Creek and giving this restaurant a try. For those not brave enough (or smarter than I am) to handle the AZ heat (especially during the summer months) you can sit inside. If you do dine inside, make sure, especially if you have kids, to get a window seat by the pond to see the ducks, turtles, occasional fish and on our last visit an owl.  We decided to sit outside as we got there early enough before it starting getting too hot outside (misters were on so that made it very comfortable) and enjoyed the live music on the patio. The rustic Mexican furniture fits the theme perfectly with Mexican blankets as seat cushions. The guitar player was really good and my 2 daughters definitely enjoyed the entertainment.  Until 11am on Sundays (not sure if this is always the case so make sure you give them a call before you head in) they have a great brunch to try out some of their menu items. I don't believe you can order off the normal menu during brunch but many of their top items are available during brunch so you should be happy either way. The Pollo Fundido is awesome as well as the Huevos Rancheros.  Everything we have tried so far has been delicious.  Can you tell I am a fan?    As my 5 year old daughter who is a big fan of Mexican food likes to say after she finishes up her breakfast and gets to feed the ducks, \"this is the best place eveeeeer!\"  If you are up for a fun experience and great Mexican food give El Encanto a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I met a group of friends at El Encanto for dinner and it was a lovely evening.  I enjoyed the ride up (about 30 minutes for me), you leave the hustle and bustle of Scottsdale and just drive.  It was late afternoon so the sun was kind of low.    El Encanto is rather large with an indoor and outdoor seating area.  My friends were already there when I arrived but I sat down and ordered a drink that was not only very good, but on the table within two minutes.  I chose the cheese enchiladas, which were really really good.  They stuff them full of cheese and onions, which I find is rare.  Most places use a meager amount of cheese but these were oozing (in fact there was cheese over everything on my plate! Yum!) and were drowning in enchilada sauce.  Just the way I like them!  Everyone enjoyed their meals which included shrimp tacos and a bean burrito.    I will definitely be returning with my husband.  I enjoyed the atmosphere outside, the service was quick (we were only there an hour) and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"I have been searching for many years for a chile relleno as yummy as my dad makes...and finally found it here! Their food is not nearly as spicy as I prefer, but it was delicious!   The chips & salsa were fresh & flavorful, and my prickly pear margarita on the rocks was made with real juice (not syrup!). Their beer selection was a bit disappointing.   The atmosphere is beautiful & relaxing, and refreshingly quiet, considering it's right in the middle of a tourist area. Lots of parking in the back & easy to walk to the nearby shops.   Can't wait to come back to AZ & try ALL of their locations :)"}
{"text":"The food was meh. Service was meh. Margarita was awful. Chips were overdone. Won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"At last wonderful Mexican food in Arizona... you would have thought that would be easy to find. A friend recommended this place and we were not disappointed in the least, The Chicken Mole was wonderful best I've had in years just a hint sweet and not flame thrower spicy. Loved the hot salsa provided which was really not very hot at all but had the great grilled tomato and pepper flavor. Also of note was the flan... our waiter was surprised we wanted dessert! of course. It was just right not thin but fully bodied with real camel flavor and density. We will be back... oh yes it was also a lot of fun to watch the turtles try to climb onto the rock ledges for the sun shine. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Have been going here for many years. We love the atmosphere and we always have terrific service. The food is Great. Wonderful place to bring friends and family. Can't say enough ole"}
{"text":"Awesome, relaxing eatery. Beautiful ambiance. Today I had the special: a beef burrito with green verde sauce. Delicious!! The best part of the experience was our waiter, Rashaad (aka Superman:). He was so friendly and positive. Made our lunch a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for my husbands bday.  We were too late for reservations, but came early to get a table for 20 people.  We waited at the bar and the bar keeps and patrons were so much fun.  Food was great too. I had chile rello de pollo. Not fried at all! And frozen margarita was good too.  Best Mexican food in the area for sure."}
{"text":"We have been going to El Encanto for years. The drive out to Cave Creek is an easy escape from the city to find excellent food in a wonderful setting. At El Encanto it's not hard to imagine you are a thousand miles away. My wife and I celebrated our 30th anniversary there recently and the staff went out of their way to accommodate our special requests. Food was great as usual and staff were gracious and professional in every aspect. Special thanks to Ryan, Eric and Robin for all they did to make a special evening come together seamlessly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is delightful! What a hidden gem! There is a beautiful duck pond surrounded by outdoor and indoor tables as well as a patio with live entertainment. Today they had a musician and a flamenco dancer! My son loved looking at the ducks, turtles, and fish in the pond.   The food was delicious! I had the pork carnitas and they were satisfying but didn't leave me feeling overly stuffed. The chips they served at the start were good although I had a hard time deciding on a salsa. They serve a mild red, medium green, and hot red. None in their own worked for me, but salsa is an individual preference. I appreciated all of the gluten free designations on the menu. The waitstaff and hostess were friendly and helpful.  Why 4 stars? The bathrooms and foyer/bar need some work. There is a very strong odor. I personally think that the bricks, tiles, and grout- just in the front area and bar- need to be pulled up and replaced. It smells so strongly of stale beer. Fortunately you only pass through this area on the way to the gorgeous main eating areas, but it is enough to mention this in the review in the hopes the owner sees it and makes a note that yes, the customers do notice the smell.  Despite this small flaw, I look forward to returning soon with my family. What a great local joint!"}
{"text":"Went last week. Always a great time. Went on Saturday night. Happily waited an hour in the bar. Nick and Jay took very good care of us as usual with chips and salsa and the nest frozen margaritas with a racing stripe of strawberry, my favorite! Had dinner outside by the pond. Brian was our server and very tolerant of our special requests. And then there is Raul. He has been a fixture the for as long as I have been a guest. He will sing any of your favorite songs, my favorite that he sings is \"Quando, quando, quando\"."}
{"text":"The food, the atmosphere and the dessert were all amazing! We wanted authentic and we got it. From Baltimore, MD"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area and I don't mind the drive. The food is good and I like sitting by the pond and watching the ducks.  Have been there there several times and quality and service where spot on"}
{"text":"Review from my 12yo son:  We went here with a large group of about 17 people. The service was slow and we ran out of water several times. I ordered the queso fundido and it was cooked well but it was too cheesy for me. I would go back again but I would order something else.   One of the kids that we were there with has special needs and the waiter never brought him his order and he didn't tell anyone so he left without eating even though his mom paid for his quesadilla!  The bathrooms were fairly clean and the duck pond is fun. You can feed the ducks, turtles and fish if you put quarters in the duck food machine.  I would go back again but I'd rather go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Visiting Cave Creek. El Encanto was recommended to us by a local. Great ambience. While we were told the wait would be 45 mins, we're were seated in less than 15 mins. Our seating with a view of the duck pond provided for a delightful experience. Staff was friendly and attentive. Tequila Lime Shrimp and Pollo Con Fundido were both very good. Excellent Fried Ice Cream. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"One word: meh.  The end.   Just kidding! Service was kind of bad. I had to ask for lemons and coke FOUR times. Rice was decent. Vegetables were good. Shrimp was good but the habanero sauce was kind of bland. Salsa tasted like pure tomato sauce and cumin. Where is the flavor? Corn chips needed salt.   Pond was pretty, though.   Nice try guys but I probably won't be returning on my own terms."}
{"text":"Overall very good, as always.  Food was spot on.  Service was fair, but at times slow.  Margaritas were fantastic.  My only complaint really is we were at table #1.  Frustrating how many people came over wedge themselves between the pond and our table, placing their rear end in our faces.....Think people."}
{"text":"Wasn't great, wasn't terrible. If you are looking for chips and salsa- go somewhere else!!! Otherwise friendly staff"}
{"text":"Best frozen margaritas, hands down, in Phoenix area.  The service and atmosphere are excellent.  The food is just ok and this is why I gave it four stars instead of five.  Because of duck pond, it's fun for kids of all ages."}
{"text":"New location of a place that already has many locations. Had five bucks off due to a coupon in my mailbox. Personally, I usually order the same dish at lunch in the other locations which is the chicken mole. It did not seemed stuffed with as much chicken as the other locations. The pollo fundido had alot of chicken though and was similar in taste to the other dishes. The chips and salsa are free, but were average and nothing else really stood out during our meal. Although with lots of empty tables, no way should a host seat a couple with a baby right behind two normal people. Of course the baby screeched and was annoying, so parents and tourists take note and leave the kids behind for the sake of regular folks who hate babies on airplanes and restaurants."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch and was not very impressed. I have been to this place years ago but things have changed and not for the better.   The server/bartender was kind of slow and I ran out of water frequently. If we asked for more salsa and chips, would you not bring enough for everyone at the table? We had three salsas to start but the server only gave us one new one. They were very small as well! It's not about the customer at this place.   I'm not a shredded chicken or shredded beef kind of person, so I was hoping to get ground beef in some enchiladas but that wasn't an option. We were told there was no ground beef.   Next thing I see is a burger go by our table. This made me question the ground beef. Was this a shredded beef burger? No, they have ground beef but not for my order. So I asked if I could get a burger patty next time and assemble my own enchilada. That seemed to be okay. I understand the food is probably prepared in advance and the burger patties are pre-made, so I get that.   I changed my order to a green corn tamale but there were no \"meals\". I had to order the tamale appetizer along with a side of beans and rice. How is this not a meal option? I'm just so confused.   Also their portion sizes have seem to get smaller while the prices have increased. The food was just \"okay\" and nothing to share on social media about. Good thing I ate before I went or I would still be hungry."}
{"text":"Good food. I got the Pollo Fundido and my wife got the Mole'.    My only complaint is that I paid $28 for a pitcher of margaritas that was 95% Ice.  That's right, ICE!   This pitcher would have been easier to drink at $15.    Also, some biker decided I parked too close to him so he spit on my drivers side window on his way out.  This is probably the same guy that didn't wash his hands after doing who knows what in the bathroom stall.  #keepitclassycavecreek"}
{"text":"This place could be described as a tourist trap, but those types of places have bad food and the food here was rather tasty. Now, I enjoy mole, but usually it is too spicy for me, but that was not the case at Encanto. The mole was on the sweet side just as the waitress had mentioned. It was ladled over my chicken enchilada and I mopped up all the sauce with ease. We ordered a $7 guac appetizer and it came with chips and this was a good, traditional version of the mean green food. Nice chunks of avocado and no spice at all. The main attraction is of course the turtle pond. We got a seat inside, but we were right next to the pond. Outside is not worth waiting 30 minutes and we arrived at sort of an off hour on a weekend. Probably less folks here during week, but the food was well worth the drive to the West's most Western town."}
{"text":"Tried my fourth El Encanto on Cinco de mayo.  The Odysea in the Desert is just beginning to gain attention and this newish El Encanto seems to be getting going too.  Food was tasty.  Service was in learning mode but did the job.  We are looking forward to the kitchen and staff hitting their stride in short order."}
{"text":"Love the environment and the food! Eating outside in the courtyard is wonderful. Live music on the weekends. Had fun feeding the ducks!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I've repeatedly gone back to this place over the years. The ambience is nice, and it's a cute place to bring out-of-town guests to wile away an afternoon. But the food is nothing to write home about -- Los Mesquites down the street is much better -- and far too expensive for quality that is comparable to what you can get at Filiberto's at 2 AM for 1/4 the price. Our last visit clinched my decision not to return when we had the most obnoxious waiter on earth. He spent the entire time he waited on us talking about how he was majorly hung over and explaining in detail how on his last shift he belittled his customers. The only thing more inappropriate would have been for him to compliment my boobs, which come to think of it would've probably been better. Oh, and by the way, one night I drove past here at around 10:00 before the front gate was shut and saw a bobcat moseying out the front door and across the street to Frontier Town - probably looking or a beer after chowing a duck."}
{"text":"Newest location of the family owned El Encanto chain. I still prefer the Cave Creek location for ambience, but pleased to have this new location closer to everything. I used to work as a busser/expo in high school and when I go back it's hard to tell anything has changed. I recommend enchiladas mole or the pollo fundido. Still my favorite place for real good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Dang!  I wish I had seen the reviews prior to visiting this restaurant but...it was not my choice, actually.  What completely freaked me out was that the bill was $85.00!  $85.00 for a meal for two!  For Mexican food!?  Excuse me!!!???  The atmosphere was nice, the waitstaff was average, and the food was sub-par.  Actually, the fish tacos were the worst I have tasted but my date loved the carnitas.  The pitchers of margaritas are largely filled with ice.  And everything is WAAAY overpriced for the flavor and quality of the food.  I won't return."}
{"text":"Que Bueno!  We got the opportunity to enjoy El Encanto recently (for brunch) and we really did enjoy it!  We had different selections along with some traditional brunch selections/offerings.  The Chorizo and eggs was very tasty, the fresh fruit, the made to order omlettes all were very good. We love the courtyard patio, such a nice touch and makes you feel like you are probably down in Mexico. Can't wait to come back for lunch or dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"We ate there on 3/18/17.  They were busy.  We sat in an area where the bartender was our waiter.  She didn't seem to interested in serving us.  We had to ask a busboy who our server was and when she came over she wasn't pleased.  We had no silverware or napkins.  I asked for some and said it would be awhile as they were wrapping silverware now.  I just walked to the other end of the dining room and took it off a vacant table.  The food was just OK.  The service was just not  good.  It was my first and probably last time there."}
{"text":"Duck! I mean ducks...all around...in the duck pond..quacking away...while I'm getting my margarita on. Ducks getting caught in the net. Ducks looking for leftover tortillas. But I duckgress. The food was cheesy..dope for being drunk off a few pitchers of Margaritas. This is the G Family Christmas and we're getting drunk at 2 in the afternoon..right before we have to go to a White Elephant party. Thanks Monica.   The server was funny..even calling his helper Antonio Banderas. The heavier version of Zorro.   I would still go with the blended margarita..at least at 2 in the afternoon. No need to get a margarita hangover this early in the day.   Props on the heaters...it was actually too hot."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Mexican restaurant that has a great setting it is surrounded by a man-made pond."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Good portion sizes and the oasis is very relaxing and fun to watch all the birds, ducks and turtles."}
{"text":"To start with the positive, this place has amazing atmosphere. This is the only reason. I can imagine for the high star reviews. The one star is for the environment,  the food is waaaay back on the negative scale. I had the pollo fundido. It was baaad. I felt ill before even leaving the place and I am really hoping it doesn't get worse."}
{"text":"Heard this place was good from a friend of ours. We are from the north west so we've have had good luck with Mexican food down here. But we weren't impressed with this place too much. Has a nice pond in the middle which is very interesting. We had the steak fajitas and they didn't really have any taste to them except meat. The 3 salsas that came with the chips were pretty blah also. The other reviews said they had some good stuff but we tried it and will move on."}
{"text":"Maybe today's visit to El Encanto was just an off day, but a couple of things marred the visit.  First, the main course was almost hot, but it would be better to describe it as very warm.  It cooled off to barely warm by the time it was halfway eaten.  The plate was very hot, but the food was only warm.  Second, our waitress didn't show up very often to see how we were doing.  We had to wait several minutes to get a drink refresh.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Pollo fundido is amazing. I have eaten here a lot and it's the only thing I have ordered. We drive at least 45 miles just to eat here and buy goat milk products from a close by store. The inside tables next to the pond are so clear it's like they aren't there. We come probably only once a month and the manager remembers us and always takes care of us. We have only had one not so great experience where the server forgot to put our order in and we were heavily compansated. Price is low enough we can bring our family of 6. The ducks and fish keep kids busy and if you aren't nervous they eat out of your hand. Duck food is sold at the register."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican I have ever had. Very fresh and authentic. The restaurant atmosphere is very unique and cool. Especially love the pond in the middle with the ducks and turtles!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place. The kids love feeding the ducks. Food is always pretty good. Margaritas are great. Didn't give it 5 stars because the hostesses are usually less than friendly. One of them made a rude comment to my four year old about buying ANOTHER pack of duck food. ( I walked up with her to the hostess stand to buy a second cone full) Ummmm, you sell it for the kids to feed the ducks. If you don't want them feeding the ducks or are limiting their food, don't sell it!! That's the reason my kids beg me to come here!"}
{"text":"Good mexican food with reasonable prices, large portions, and with a nice ambiance. The outdoors area is very nice and has a lot of seating so you shouldn't have to wait too long for a table. The food is straightforward and good (not amazing but not disappointing). We had:  - Queso Guillermo: A yummy cheesy dip made from real cheese (none of that weird nacho cheese stuff) served with corn tortillas. It's very filling but probably not one of the best fundidos I've had. The cheese isn't really melted that well together so it ends up forming clumps and a strange liquid separation layer. It could have used more flavor like chilis or cilantro or something. - Fajita Taco Salad: A straightforward but solid salad served in a fried tortilla shell. The veggies are a little on the greasy side. The refried beans and guacamole were my favorite parts. - Chile Relleno con Pollo: My boyfriend got this and thought it was good. I think their rice is average."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant because we were hoping for a better Mexican meal than other nearby paces. There are lots of adequate but not particularly good Mexican restaurants.  This one had good chips, good margaritas, decent entrees, not very good guacamole, etc.   This is closer than our default Mexican restaurant but the food isn't quite as good.   It didn't help that, as we arrived, the hostess told us we would have to wait 20 minutes for a table: there were two tables inside in use and two outside.  My wife said we would go elsewhere so we were seated immediately. We were greeted by our waitress soon thereafter. Drinks came quickly. Food came in a reasonable time. More chips were offered.   I hope things improve but this has been open long enough not to have staff and service problems."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. This place has authentic Mexican food. The ceviche was awesome. It is hard to find good ceviche and this place had it. The service was great and everyone was very friendly. The atmosphere was very nice and clean. The manager even stopped by to chat with us. For me to visit Cave creek for the first time this place made my visit even better. Definitely going to come back. Our drive from gilbert was so worth it.."}
{"text":"This is such a nice place to get some very tasty mexican food. We went to dinner and got the platos burros and a quesadilla. Our server was very pleasant. She checked in on us, made sure that we always had water and our food was out very quickly (it was amazing). We love the pond and ducks while eating dinner, so relaxing. I am a huge fan of El Encanto and will return."}
{"text":"You'll see as many locals eating here as winter visitors/tourists. The atmosphere is comfortable, service is good, and food is delicious!   It can get pretty busy during peak season, so make a reservation or come mid-afternoon to avoid the crowd, although they're great at managing the mayhem!   Enjoy the patio if it's nice out. They fire up the patio heaters if it's chilly, and serve frozen pitchers of margaritas if you need to sit by the cool of the pond on a warmer day!   Enjoy our beautiful town! There's not another place like it! ;-)"}
{"text":"Good, not great. Under-seasoned from app to entre; various rooms smelled like sulfur."}
{"text":"made a reservation early in the week to celebrate our daughter's birthday called to see if we could move it to an earlier time.  We discovered  that the reservation was never put into the system.   The attitude of the staff was \"Who cares. we really don't need your business\" .  My husband then spoke to the manager who told us to come up and wait until a table was free...60 minutes.  I had eaten here before and the food is fine...nothing to rally write home about  and not worth a 60 minute wait."}
{"text":"We popped in here before visiting the OdySea Aquarium last night and had a GREAT experience! Ronnie was super attentive and took great care of us. :) We sat at the bar and enjoyed some margaritas, chips, DELICIOUS salsa, guac, and split the *sizzling* fajitas! Since we were splitting, we got the chicken and steak combo and a few extra tortillas. The flavor was incredible! It came with a side of beans, guac, and pico de gallo. If visiting OdySea in the Desert again, I will absolutely dine here! I loved their thin, crispy chips. If you have delicious chips + salsa, you're automatically a winner in my book! Thank you for the wonderful dinner experience, El Encanto!"}
{"text":"The carne asada burro with the fundido sauce is amazing! However, the shredded chicken is kinda dry and flavorless. We like the patio and the atmosphere, and the prices are right!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was large and packed with customers. The service was excellent, fast and delicious. Can't wait to go back to AZ"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and I just love this place.  It can get really busy on the weekends, but if you go mid-week for lunch you will find the patio very relaxing. The restaurant looks like it used to be a house.  There is a pond in the back with ducks and turtles that can be viewed from both the outside and in-depending on where you sit. The pollo fundido is the best, shredded chicken in a deep fried burro with jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar melted on top- probably a million calories, but worth it. I've never really had a problem with the service and the food has been consistently good.  Plus it's in charming Cave Creek, great place to bring out-of-towners.  Actually, the restaurant was even mentioned in a book I read recently (the author was local)."}
{"text":"I was brought here by chance on Christmas Eve. It was a welcomed change from other valley Mexican restaurants. The open patio in the back with the turtle and duck pond really was magical. I had the pleasure of trying their shrimp taco suave and their taco fritas. The taco suave was particularly good. It had onions and red cabbage. Put a little bit of their homemade salsas on them and wach their taste explode. Very savory and spicy. I was pleased to find such a flavorful and authentic restaurant so far off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Love El Encanto, if you want Mexican food this is the place to go. I do love both El Encanto & El Encanto Dos but seem to favor El Encanto on Cave Creek Rd . It's very authentic. Food is absolutely delicious and the Sangria goes great with any menu item !!"}
{"text":"The historic Western charm of days gone by are on full display in the Cave Creek area.  Plenty of dust of get on your 'boys and an equal amount of watering holes to keep you hydrated.  Thinking we'd find an Irish cowboy, we headed to El Encanto on St. Paddy's day.  This open air (at least in the center of the restaurant) was perfect for the amazing Arizona weather this time of year.  Complete with a large wading pool for waterfowl and goldfish, guitar strumming mariachis, and excellent service El Encanto services up ambience in spades.  The one thing you won't find is a James Beard award winning results on your plate, and that's ok.  The food is not bad and actually quite passable- just barely.  I had the pescado with veggies and rice in the habanero sauce. The fish was average, the veggies perfect and the rice with corn (nice touch) was a little undone.  The habanero sauce was not spicy at all, very little flavor.  The Princess had close to the same dish (although with shrimp). She enjoyed it but said the same thing about the sauce.  I had a margarita on the rocks and it wreaked of a sweet mix rather than a simple craft margarita of tequila, lime juice, maybe some Cointreau.  P had some Cabernet and enjoyed it.   Overall, this is a fun place to take in some great vibes and enjoyable (not great) Mexican food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because the kiddos wanted to hang out and feed the ducks. My husband and approaches the hostess stand and was rudely told by Robin that they were not seating any one outside. We talked it over for a bit and the kids really wanted to stay. I re-approached the hostess and she asked if we wanted to sit by the window. I said yes and she reiterated that no one could sit outside. I laughed it off and made a comment about the kids wanting to be outside to play. She said (very curtly), \"Well, this IS a restaurant and kids can't just run around.\" I laughed and told her that we would be dining elsewhere. My kids had been standing there quietly the entire time - no running, no yelling and no fits. I guess she had to assert herself and put us in our place. I'm not sure why they have the ducks and allow kids to feed them if they don't want kids playing outside. My husband then asked her for her name and her supervisors contact information. She told us she was in charge - we asked her if she was the owner of the restaurant (to which she answered \"no\"). We then requested this individuals contact information. She reluctantly have us an email address. She then told my husband \"well, what should I have said to your wife?\"  At this point we disengaged with her and left. We headed down the road to the Buffalo Chip Saloon and had excellent service.   This was the straw that broke the camels back - the food was mediocre and this type of service is abhorrent. If my children are misbehaving then feel free to tell me something but don't provide me with preemptive and unsolicited parenting advice. This place is definitely off of our list of places to eat. We will use our hard earned money to patronize establishments with staff that knows how to treat its customers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite little gem in Cave Creek! The Mexican food is as you'd expect, and it's authentic enough for my liking without being pretentious! The restaurant itself is just so homey and there's a spot in the house for everyone with an amazing outdoor patio, indoor setting, and a more secluded bar area. I think this restaurant does so well because of the atmosphere. With the small pond and outdoor patio, I could sit here all day, slam down some chips and salsa, and indulge in their margaritas. It's just a great place to be! Everything I've eaten here is tasty, very filling, and the staff doesn't skimp on the chips and salsa refills. If you're anything like me then you agree that chips and salsa are life! It's been somewhat of a tradition for my family to eat here every time we are in town and I plan to make another stop here the next time I drive through beautiful Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"It was 2pm on a Saturday and very busy. 30 minute wait to get a table. Got a nice seat by the water inside, the service was good our server tried to accommodate requests. Kitchen forgot to omit onions in one order. Ice tea was watered down. Chips and salsa: chips were great tomatillo salsa was bland, other two salsa were great. Food was ok/good - not sizzling hot, the plates were hot but the food wasn't. Weird bathroom layout."}
{"text":"the atmosphere was pretty cool and there's an artificial pond in the middle of the outdoor area  which is good for photos and for the kids. The salsa and chips were great and ate a lot of them since we were so hungry.  I ordered a Fajita Taco Salad. It was huge and looked so good. But, looks could be deceiving. The chicken didn't really have any favor and the salad just felt like I was eating lettuce. It was sort of a let down, as we were leaving my date (who grew up in the area) said she wasn't impressed either and she said it wasn't as good as she remembered."}
{"text":"They are quite busy so I snuck in and grabbed a table in the bar. Chips are light and crunchy. Salsa was good. I need to tell you about the amazing pescado lunch. $9.99 and it was mahi mahi today. Grilled and topped with pico de gallo. Cooked perfectly. Moist and flavorful. Also served with rice. The rice is good. Not mind blowing but have I mentioned the FISH?? Get here before you're starving if you want to enjoy the fabulous courtyard."}
{"text":"Our server Mike was excellent. We sat outside in the area closest to the restaurant itself and there were toasty overhead space heaters that kept us quite warm, some of our table neighbors were a little too toasty!  On this night we had a traditional chili relleno which was stuffed with cheese and then batter dipped and fried, and a grilled flattened chicken breast topped with a spicy Ranchero sauce.  Both were very good, and the chili was made even better with the suggestion from Mike to add the green chili sauce (with meat) on top of it for only two extra dollars. You might be thinking wait - two dollars for chili sauce? Ah but no this was not just thin green chili sauce, it was a green beef chili stew with large chunks of tender beef and they put lots of it over the chili relleno - it was well worth the added cost and even felt like a value.  This place has very few spicy dishes available so it was nice for Mike to guide me into choosing the chicken as I asked about options that had some kick.   The chili was so flavorful that we can't wait until our next visit to go back there and order one for each of us!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We sat outside and it was so nice! All of our food was good but the fundido was great! Definitely try it if you go here. I can't wait to eat there again on my next visit to AZ!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I want to like this place more! It has charm, plenty of it, from the arched entry to the inner courtyard complete with water fowl. The service is great, staff is attentive, but notice I haven't mentioned the food yet. The food is, well, underwhelming. When we have so many outstanding Mexican restaurants in the area, it is simply not enough to have a ho- hum approach to the offerings. Spice it up, get creative with fresh ingredients, or go for authentic old-school Sonoran style Mexican, but do it like you care, like you love the food and want to share it with your guests. So go to this restaurant if you are looking for atmosphere, but maybe look around a bit further if you want a full flavor Mexican dining experience."}
{"text":"Good food, nice location and an American Mexican restaurant kind of vibe.  Great for a lunch meeting and a nice place to break if you're at the odyssey aquarium or other attractions nearby.  My favorite was the one the ever changing specials. So if your adventurous, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great food, nice environment with outside duck pond (romantic) Service of food is slow though or I would have given 5 stars. Make a reservation if planning to dine in the evening as they are extremely busy during peak tourist season."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place!  There is something about the ambiance here, and Cave Creek in general.  When I lived in the area from 1998-2002, I would frequent it for lunch at least once every few months.  Now that I live in the far SE valley, I will still make the occasional \"trek\" up north!  The food is very good, in my opinion, and I have eaten a lot of Mexican food in my day.  Today I ordered the chicken enchilada lunch w/ green sauce, rice & beans.  It was just delicious...piping hot, not too spicy, with large pieces of chicken breast with that greasy, cheesy goodness smothered on top.  It was too hot to sit out on the patio, so a nice table with a view of the pond was relaxing.  Yes, the pond water is dirty!!!!  But the ducks and turtles don't seem to mind :)  I've been here a few times in the evening, and the enlarged patio with the fireplace and tree lights etc. make for a wonderful place to have a few drinks and enjoy a nice relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"My family and I dined at El Encanto on Sat. May 12th and had the most horrendous, humiliating and embarrassing experience. This place is labeled as wheelchair accessible but it is clearly not an establishment for anyone who is disabled. I was using my scooter due to pain issues and the greeter who seated us was very nice to take my scooter away so that it was not in the way but after needing to use the facilities a bus boy helped me by taking the scooter away and I appreciated both of their assistance. After returning to the table and getting the scooter situated my family and I were talking and enjoying the view of the water, I was reminiscing on childhood trips to dine at the restaurant when out of nowhere Robin the manager comes yelling at me shaking her finger at me and screaming about how my scooter isn't a toy and that I had no business letting her employees ride my scooter. She also said other things I did not catch because she was just yelling like a crazy woman. All of the other customers were whispering and looking at us so I was embarrassed. As if that wasn't bad enough she continued to yell and make a scene as she walked from one end of the restaurant to the to the other. Then she started to yell at the young man who had helped me in front of everybody. I had just come from a place where I felt so empowered and not so different and in one minute she ruined my mood and my view of the place. Right before she came to our table yelling I was telling my family how much I loved the place and how many fond memories I had and how good I felt after the event we attended. Robin was unprofessional, inconsiderate, racist and a Bitch. I would love to speak to the owners because if she is representing this establishment then they are in big trouble. I felt that I was targeted because of my being disabled and because my family and I were the only Hispanic people there at the time. While Robin was so busy yelling at me there were about ten small children jumping and climbing the rocks near the water with the parents too busy drinking and laughing to pay attention. I believe she should have focused on that issue instead of who was riding my scooter. She wanted me to leave my scooter behind the desk in front but how the hell was I suppose to get to the table without my scooter that is why the two employees helped me by taking it for me. That woman needs a lesson on what it is to be disabled and also a class in how to be professional. She could have come to our table and introduced herself and stated her purpose for even being at our table instead of yelling like a maniac. There was another manager there a guy but he just came to our table like a dog with his tail between his legs not really doing anything to help the situation or to even try to make it better. My mom had to tell him that she didn't think it was right to have to pay for a meal that we couldn't even enjoy but even then he had a hard time saying he would comp it. I was so disgusted I just paid for our stuff so we could get the hell out of there. I hope that Robin is punished for her behavior and I hope the wheelchair accessible label is removed from this establishment because it is far from accepting the disabled as long as Robin is there. If I could give a no star rating I would because it deserves no stars after the way we were treated so I do not recommend this place at all if you are disabled or Hispanic."}
{"text":"So I would love to give zero stars because of the lack of service we received, but since that isn't N option they get one. We came here on a Saturday night, had a reservation for 20, and didn't have a table ready. Additionally, we didn't have a table ready even within an hour of our reservation. They told us that the kitchen is small,so they couldn't accommodate a party that large, so we would have to have a limited menu as well. We ended up bussing the tables in a separate bar table ourselves, getting chips and salsa from the bar ourselves, getting our own drinks, and though we waited for an hour still never got a table, so we left. I find it hard to believe that even a small restaurant couldn't accommodate a party such as this on a Saturday night within an hour. Apparently this small restaurant doesn't need to fill its seats, and can afford to turn away a table of 20 folks that probably would have racked up at least a $1200 bill with drinks and food."}
{"text":"In six decades of life and spending my share of time \"deployed\" to the Southwest of the US and eaten at more than my share of \"Mexican\" restaurants... El Encanto was the best of ANY I've had and my wife and two of my adult children agree that hands down El Encanto is the best. We had a variety of menu items between us and every one of them was superior. My beef taco salad was so good that I hope to never have a trip to Arizona in the future that does not include a meal at El Encanto. The prices were very good, the ambiance was superb and our server Allison was a top notch professional, absolutely exceptional. To be within 75 miles of Cave Creek and not take in a meal at El Encanto would be a sorely missed opportunity. Great food, atmosphere and service a definite trifecta!"}
{"text":"Very nice dining area. Relaxing with the waterfall and pond. The food, unfortunately, was mediocre at best. Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"The pollo fundido is my personal favorite with a margarita. The atmosphere is great... I prefer to sit on the patio so that I can enjoy the pond and the weather."}
{"text":"Went here for a rehearsal dinner, so I can't judge on what the normal dinner experience is, but I'll give you my simple pros and cons: Pros: -BIG, really big restaurant -You can ask the hostess for duck food and feed the ducks in the pond -Indoor/outdoor restaurant  -Lots of space -Really fun location.  I'm from the east coast and this area of Arizona is like a tv show to me.  Real cowboys, cactii, and awesome western shoppes and restaurants    Cons: -Salsa tasted like tomato sauce -Wine was eh. (only had red or white to choose from, but nothing to write home about) -Beer wasn't cold  Take it or leave it: lots of kids running around"}
{"text":"Eh. This place has a nice patio. I would recommend this place for drinks and apps. If any out of towners think they want to do dinner here, maybe do drinks and apps and then move along. Asking for drinks before everyone has even sat down, not bringing the drinks before mains arrived and then only touching base once during service. The support staff is more friendly and on top of it. Again, drinks and apps people, drinks and apps."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is what makes this place special. The food and margaritas aren't the best I've ever had (I'm admittedly biased coming from an area that has fantastic Mexican food) but they are pretty good. I like that they offer three different types of salsa with the chips as a starter. My one year old loves feeding the ducks and looking for turtles. Overall, this place is great for families and big parties. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, the food is very good and up until this last visit the service was great. However this lad experience was probably the worst I have had in a restaurant . From the beginning the staff was rude and not happy to be there. Our server Sutton, was extremely rude to the woman at our table. The server didn't write down our orders, which I have experienced many times at other restaurants and when the food comes out with all the proper modification its impressive, however when most of the meals came to the table they were incorrect this time. At the end of the evening AFTER PAYING , I spoke to the manager , and the server came over and decided to yell at me about how we were in the wrong for not ordering properly. Lastly one of the people in our group left there iPhone at the table. It was not found , however using the find my phone feature it clearly showed the phone in the restaurant in the back of the kitchen.    Update 6/7/17 I received this message from the server on Yelp.  Neno B: Richard, how is it that you cannot keep a story straight. Everyones order was wrong or did you just eat your aunts plate. See I know you had 1 chicken and 1 cheese no onion. I seen you eat 85% of it then ask for anther free meal. Is that how you do business? I took care of you for 2 hrs of which the first 30min you party was not complete. You personally drank 3 liters of diet coke and ate 2 meals. Why drink diet coke if you eat that much? Dishonest you say, then why not tell the people after 2 hrs and a 114 bill you came at me with your big \"this is why I'm tipping you poorly\" speech. Then left and came back to say I threw you phone in the pond? But now find my iPhone says its in the kitchen? I truly feel sorry for you. If you treated people like people, I'm sure you wouldn't have such poor karma. Ps where your aunts carna asada tacos wrong or the girls chicken fajita ummm seems like Richard cannot keep a story STRAIGHT. oh and ask my name next time so that you can actually call me out. You honestly thing parents would name a kid Sutton, God your dumb but I already knew that from the 2 hrs we shared together. Call someone a thief then stick to that story, no wonder you lack results because you are a habitual liar. Don't worry I don't blame you I blame you backwoods upbringing. I hope if you actually did lose your phone which, obviously I don't believe, I hope it turns up or atleast that you take your time and small brain to figure out how to actually use the app correctly. Oh did you know Florida is considered the scammer capital? I see You FL. Bye for now your good friend who's name you never asked. Hope I could teach you something, but chances are you to dumb to read this for what it is.    If you want good food and bad service and dishonest staff , then you will love this place!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Arizona.  Love the machomos with quest guillermo and the frozen margarita. Normally I'm a rocks girl, but the frozen stays cool on a hot summer day and doesn't get watered down. A must try."}
{"text":"I was pleased with the unique and unexpected flavors of the food here. The atmosphere and setting is lovely. Although we sat inside and not on the patio, our view was still great. The Pollo fundido and carne asada dishes were my favorite."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican food restaurant! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is very welcoming. We went on a Sunday night about an hour before they closed and they were still very busy so I knew the food was going to be good but I didn't think it was going to be that good! It's about a 45 minute drive away but so worth it."}
{"text":"love the endless fresh chips and salsa, fun atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in Arizona! The prickly pear margaritas are seductive and delicious, the pollo fundidio is to die for, the atmosphere and ambiance are lovely and the service is always good. Any out of town/country visitors that come to stay with me get to experience El Encanto and they all still rave about it. There's often a wait in the evenings on weekends but you can hang out and have a drink at the bar, I always choose to drive out to Cave Creek because I think it's a cool little spot and enjoy the character. Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The real deal.  The chicken chimi's and handmade chips/salsa are amazing.  Get a seat by the koi pond, have a cocktail, and listen to some good music."}
{"text":"We really liked this place.  Feels like you are away in Mexico somewhere.  They have good food and ambiance. A huge fish pond is in the courtyard.  Great service.  We brought our family who were visiting and they really enjoyed it too.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This has to be a top 3 Mexican restaurant in the valley. The setting makes it my favorite. Great outdoor patio and duck pond. They usually have a talented mariachi band on the busy nights. The pollo fundido is the best that I have had. Everything else that I have tried is very good as well except for the fish tacos. I would stick to something more traditional here. The pitcher of margaritas I always get helps washes everything down."}
{"text":"This place came recommended from a lot of our neighbors as a must-try.  I had the pollo fundido - absolutely delicious for me.  The setting/atmosphere/ambiance is lovely.  I was disappointed when my son couldn't get a simple plate of nachos - nothing fancy - we just asked for chips and melted cheese and was met with an almost appalled 'no'.  He didn't enjoy his tacos - so won't be going back as a family :-("}
{"text":"Food was awesome & the Pomegranate margaritas were so delicious!!! The service there left some bittersweet feelings but in their defense they seemed severely understaffed. The restaurant was really busy and there only seemed to be one waiter & the host in front and the rest were cooks. These poor guys did their best to move around quick enough to help everyone but they just couldn't move fast enough! Poor guys truly did their best so I hope management gives them some help because they were both troopers! We would definitely be back to give them a chance!!"}
{"text":"The staff has always been friendly and the service is good. We've been here a few times & the good is consistent. The restaurant is comfortable & the kids enjoy the pond. The food isn't fancy and the menu is a bit limited in selections, but we've enjoyed it and all go back."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to going to El Encanto for a great meal & Flamenco dancing (advertised to start at 5:30 every Sunday on the patio). When we got to the restaurant and asked to sit near the dancing, we were told by the hostess, \"we don't do that anymore.\" After she checked with someone else in the restaurant she told us that the dancing did not start until 6PM and that we \"should leave and come back.\" When we told her we would go to the bar for drinks, they gave us a buzzer for later seating. When the buzzer rang, we were told that they would not seat us at all. For what we had at the bar.....we won't bother to go back. There are better options for flamenco and great food in Phoenix. What a waste of time the trip to Cave Creek was today."}
{"text":"What a great Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area!  We enjoyed a nice lunch outside by the pond on Saturday.  The enchiladas and the carne asada burro was delicious.  The service was good, the place was huge and felt authentic - we'll be back if we're in the Carefree area again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice. Tropical with a Mexican flare, nice pond with fish and ducks. You can sit inside or outside, we sat inside next to the windows that looked over the pond, I was very impressed that the windows were so clean you could not tell they were even there. Now about the food, you get chips and salsa when you sit down, there is 3 different salsas, mild, medium, and hot.  They were all just okay, I thought they were pretty tasteless. Hubby and I ordered the Pollo Fundido, it would have been really good if it wasn't so dry, it was all white meat so I'm sure that had a lot to do with it, it was covered with a jalapeno cream sauce which was wonderful, but there was hardly enough. My friend had a Chicken salad which looked very good, I should have gotten that."}
{"text":"Came to the restaurant on a crazy Friday.   We sat down in their side room and the had the best server I've ever had at EL Encanto.  We have been coming here for over 15 years.  Our servers name was Laina and much respect to her and she made sure we were taken care of.   She is a keeper and a must get server."}
{"text":"My family of 5 and my parents went to dinner here on a Saturday night. They wouldn't take a reservation, only walk ins. They told us 45 min wait and they were right on schedule with that estimate. The margaritas were great, food was awesome, service was friendly, we were even serenaded!! The pond in the middle courtyard with ducks, turtles, and fish kept us entertained. It was a great dinner experience!"}
{"text":"We called on a rainy, Sunday afternoon and were told they were not taking reservations.  There were six of us.  When we arrived at 5 pm, we were told there would be a 45 minute wait.  We had a member of our party needing to catch a flight so we asked why we had to wait so long as there were several tables available.  The young ladies at the counter said we could have called in two hours ahead and they would have had a place for us.  However, we did call in two hours ahead and were told they were not taking reservations because it was raining.  I was confused, upset and ended up at The Spotted Donkey, spending $200 and it was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"We love Mexican food but unfortunately I can't recommend this place. It is a beautiful place but the food is just okay. I want to love this place because it is so close to home, but I just can't. The chips and salsa are good, but the food is about average."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. 3 choices of sauces with complimentary chips. Taquitos were too hard to bite in to. Dry chicken burrito. Rice was dry and hard. The rest of the food wasn't anything memorable. What we do remember was the sun shining in our eyes the entire meal, maybe invest in some window shades"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant ever for Mexican food. Amazing choices for authentic Mexican food. I have been eating here for over 20 years."}
{"text":"El Encanto is about 35 minutes from my house, but we drive there as often as we can to have their lunch. I love the mole chicken enchiladas! The best I have ever tasted! My husband likes their fajitas and tacos. You can't go wrong with these items. I gave it 4/5 stars, because their margaritas are not very good. They are watered down & you can not taste any liquor. However, the food is amazing and if I lived closer, I would eat here all the time. This is a GREAT place to take your guests when they are visiting AZ and if you're the one visiting, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Went to El Encanto yesterday for mid-afternoon lunch. As others have noted, the ambience and decor were hard to beat. The authentic Mexican tile work, the pond, and the squawking goose all lent an air of delightful authenticity. Our sangrias were tasty but a bit pricey for the serving size, considering they were over half ice. The complementary basket of chips was dry and unsalted but the salsa selection was a nice touch. I preferred the fire roasted tomato salsa while my friend liked the pureed red salsa. Neither of us favored the green salsa. My lunch special, grilled Mahi Mahi with rice, was tasty and ample - just slightly on the dry side. My friend said her vegetarian enchiladas were very good. We both saved room for dessert but but had to send our sopapillos back to the kitchen. They were made with a wheat dough that was too salty and undercooked and they were served already topped with a whisper of cinnamon, powdered sugar, and a light drizzle of honey. By the time our waiter brought individual plates for each of us, we had each sampled a sopapilla and decided they were just not to our taste. Our waiter confided that it was his first lunch shift ever, and it showed. He was very kind but needed to learn the finer points of service. There did not seem to be anyone overseeing him. Hopefully he will learn to anticipate a diner's needs (like keeping water glasses full, providing individual plates for shared portions, remembering a request for split tickets, bringing change back to the patron who pays with cash).  I'm sure I will return to Cave Creek but I probably try another restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Great service, disappointing food. Not horrible but just not good:( It'd be nice if they could figure it out."}
{"text":"This place has always given me great food, great drinks and great customer service! Tonight I indulged in an appetizer that is just as good for a meal, the Queso Guillermo. I get it with the Machomos, the seasoned crispy beef, squeeze a few limes on the meat and smother it with the bubbly cheese and pico de gallo. Sooo Good!   Our waitress this evening even brought me an extra helping of the seasoned beef at no extra charge because I mentioned how the first time I ordered it to split with a friend that they piled it on the dish. That was because the first time we were sharing the appetizer as a meal.  The restaurant always looks clean, I wouldn't eat anywhere that was unsanitary and I've eaten next to the pond during the day and in the evening and I have never smelled any duck poop smell!"}
{"text":"I went to el encanto for the 2nd time. I tried the Jalapeño Rellenos. Oh my, thought I'd died and gone to heaven! So delicious!! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Mexican food, pass on this place 'cuz THIS AIN'T IT, FOLKS!  Dispute the lovely water setting that we were told about, the place was busy and we were were seated next to a wall where we listened to screaming kids who were seated by the pond.   While service was adequate, the food was below average. Generally tasteless lunch all around. Just seemed like the food was thrown together with no sense of pride. Amateurish cooking and presentation.  My husband's salad was just a big plate of course chopped lettuce, a scoop each of black beans and corn and not much else on it. My taco was small, tough and cold. Chips and salsas were bland and boring. You too can have the same slop we had for $40 or can do yourself a favor and skip it."}
{"text":"Love that the kids are entertained. Great margaritas and chips and salsa. I suavely get the fajitas. Kids love the cheese crisp and my husband gets the fish."}
{"text":"Service and staff are excellent.  They really go that extra step.  Atmosphere is cool I guess, but it depends where you get seated.  Our last visit they put us at a small table for two in a high traffic area and next to a large party with several small kids running in circles and roughhousing right next to our table.  They moved us at my request to a much better spot.  Again, they are very accommodating.    I do find the food to be salty and on the oily side, more so than I am used to with Mexican food.  Last time my wife had fajitas, they were dripping in oil.  Doesn't thrill me, and I've had better Mexican food I am sorry to say, and I don't think we'll go back any time soon.  We're usually not in the CC area anyway, so nothing missed there.  It's out of the way for us when we're in AZ."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I am not the biggest fan of Mexican food, so when we decided to try this place for lunch I was kind of expecting the same greased up, fried, typical Mexican food. Boy, was I wrong! The ambiance is so perfect...with their swans & turtles swimming in the pond. The outdoor would be a beautiful venue for a rehearsal dinner or any fun get together. Decorated festive but not overdone. The salsas they bring out before your meal are tasty: mild/medium was my favorite. Husband loved the spicy & the tomatillo was  also good. We were told the portions are huge, so husband & I split the pollo fundido which came with beans and rice. Delicious! I had the most perfect prickly pear margarita. Overall terrific experience!"}
{"text":"Alison is the hands down best bartender I've ever witnessed in my 32 years of existence. Her glorious shining self, truly expressed bartending at its most fabtabulous. She was super busy and despite that she got super busy on my taste buds. Love this restaurant love Alison."}
{"text":"delicious food, friendly staff, great drinks and beautiful pond ambiance. what more do you need?  they have ducks and turtles in the pond overlooked by a lovely patio."}
{"text":"The best margaritas, by far!  Our favorite place for Ahi Tacos and margaritas! The bartenders, Nick and Jesus are awesome! The service is wonderful! Love the staff here. So friendly and helpful. Been coming here for a long time and would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was friendly and fast and the patio was very pleasant with the pond with ducks and turtles.  Dave got the Pollo Fundido and it was the perfect serving size with excellent flavor. I got the Carne Asada soft tacos and they were good. 3 different salsas come with chips and they were all good. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service was adequate at best. Water carafe brought to table but waiter or bus boy never filled or refilled any glasses. Food was poor. Ordered the special which was a red/green sauce chicken burrito and a fajita taco salad. Chicken in burrito was 75% fat. Couldn't even eat it. Salad had edible chicken but was flavorless. Salad also had giant chunks of the lettuce stem. Would not recommend eating here. Not Mexican food by any stretch of the imagination."}
{"text":"Food was decent and atmosphere was great. Live music and dancing was a nice touch.   Service was mediocre at best. There didn't seem to be a manager within sight and much of the staff seemed disinterested. They had a heck of a time just getting our order right and getting it to the table in some sort of orderly fashion.   Enjoyable night but we had to ignore the disorganized and cranky staff."}
{"text":"okay so... had a 45 minutes wait, which was to be expected on a Sunday, but unnecessary considering only half of the dining room and half of the patio was open. I have no idea what all the fuss over the margs is about, ours was left full on the table when we closed our tab. the food was actually good... but not good enough to deal with the terrible service. our server was clearly miserable from the very beginning. her adorable little rainbow rowed pens in her apron gave me a positive initial impression, until she opened her mouth. my husband was severed the wrong dish, he holds an executive position in food and beverage and isn't one to \"complain\"... luckily the food runner realized and brought him out something else. the wrong dish. again. we didn't see our server for 25 minutes after the food was dropped. we waited, finished, in search of the check so we could gtfo. I approached a manager and asked him for help, he asked me if I had lost something to which I replied yeah, my server. he giggled and walked off. while walking out I caught a glimpse of the kitchen and I'm SO glad I didn't catch it prior to eating because it would have been a struggle. the turtles in the pond were super cute though. for whatever that's worth. ownership change? management turnover? whatever happened it definitely wasn't for the better."}
{"text":"Holy moly make a reservation if you are coming here or expect a long wait! Hopefully if you dont make reservations you can grab a seat at the bar for some pre-dinner drinks! We were given chips and salsa while we waited at the bar which was a nice plus! We split the steak and chicken fajitas. I thought they were really good but I cant be totally sure as I was completely starving by the time we sat down! The refried beans and rice were also very good! Overall, the service was pretty good considering the wait time!"}
{"text":"So good! This place has the best guacamole I have probably ever tasted!! And margaritas!!   I also love the atmosphere and the ducks that hangout outside in the pond. I feed them when the staff isn't looking if I'm sitting outside...don't tell if you see me doing it :-D"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that used to be one of the jewels of cave creek. I have never given a yelp review before, but the food has gotten so bad that it really needs to be brought before the current management and potential customers. The setting is so special that it would be a shame to see it close, but the food quality has declined to home microwave quality. This is based on our last two meals there over 6 months."}
{"text":"This is a well run operation. It's a big efficient restaurant with a young friendly helpful staff.  Great tortilla chips with a flight of salsas - all fresh & good. Had the traditional shrimp cocktail with spicy tomato broth & chopped veg. Very tasty. Then wonderful tamales - I loved the green tamale especially & our waitress happily added refried beans & good rice to make it a dinner. Wonderful."}
{"text":"I absolutely love bringing my girlfriend here for lunch dates. The pond makes for a unique setting you won't find anywhere else and the food isn't half bad either."}
{"text":"Literally heaven.  If I needed to propose to someone it would be here.  Legendary food, service, atmosphere, everything was on point.  A+++++"}
{"text":"Just moved into town this spring of 2017. Love the atmosphere in this place. Indoor and nice outdoor area with seating alongside the pond and all the beautiful birds that gather. Not many great places to eat in Cave Creek but this is one we feel good about bringing our friends to when they come to visit. Friendly staff and tasty \"Americanized\" Mexican food. It shouldn't disappoint unless you're looking for authentic. Margaritas are tasty. I favor the prickly pear blended. We are vegetarian so plenty of options and they are more than willing to accommodate."}
{"text":"The duck pond was my favorite part , but it is kind of dirty and lacking pond plants for the turtles that live there.  If you are shopping along this strip and need a break this will do because It IS NOT THE WORST but also NOT The best in American style Mexican cuisine.  We thought we were going to try the $14.95 buffet but took a peek and decided against it because nothing to use looked appetizing and there were very few choices I think only 6 buffet pans plus an omelet station .  They gave us the chips and the 3 sauces so MAYBE it's just me but all 3 sauces had an unusual ingredient added that I didn't care for .  My Chicken Fajita salad came and I DO NOTE this was the greasiest and oiliest one I have ever had it was very generous with peppers and onions and red cabbage that I picked out because dripping with oil . The chicken had an odd texture sort of dried out but juicy like a dry sponge with liquid . My salad also came with Mexican Style sour cream and  guacamole . I asked for the re fried beans on the side and my husband tried them he said they were just unseasoned whipped beans that really needed some salt .  My husband tried the carnitas and thought the actual pork was OK but the black beans that came with it just had an awful smoke flavor to them and he also wasn't a fan of the corn tortillas . He was having gastric problems the next day and thought it was from here since  I was fine and it was the only food we had different the day before . (so it seemed like kind of visiting Mexico for real) I can't say positively that this was from here just a guess .  If you dine here a table would be better than a booth because you will have a better view of the ducks , swans and turtles ."}
{"text":"This place is one of the \"staples\" of Cave Creek. Been around forever. Food is always great. Scenery inside and duck pond is cool. Margarita are great and you can order pitchers of them. Great place for lunch or dinner. Been coming here for 20+ years since I was a kid."}
{"text":"Great mexican, visited one time out here looking for houses and now I live here, cant wait to visit all the time"}
{"text":"The mild salsa is tomato paste, the medium/green salsa is the only half way decent one, but it is still meh. The \"hot salsa\" is not spicy and tastes blah. The food is total crap, and it's not cheap. The patio is very nice but that's about all this place has going for it. This is one of the worst \"Mexican\" restaurants we have ever been to. We will never go back. We regret not leaving after tasting the crappy salsa.  UPDATE: it's now 4:40am next morning and I've just been woken up by the most awful stomach cramps and I feel completely ill from the disgusting food I ate from this sad excuse for a Mexican restaurant. I will be contacting my parents later this morning to find out if they too are having stomach issues from our regrettable visit in last night."}
{"text":"I have been shopping at Retablo since 2013, 2 years before I moved to Arizona. I have since moved to Arizona and I'm still shopping there and have found everyone wonderful to work with.  There hasn't been anything that I have needed that the owners & employees have not been able to help me with. Most of my house is furnished with furniture is from Retablo. .  Anything you are looking for they you can get at Retablo. Thank you Gretchen for everything."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. I have been coming here for years and sitting outside by the pond always makes me feel like I'm on a mini break from AZ but over the course of the last year or so I feel the quality of the food has severly declined. I don't know what happened but it's nowhere near as good as it used to be. Shame because it's a cool place!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in the PHX metro area. Drinks awesome, eveything about thus place is great."}
{"text":"Fundido! Fundido! Fundido!!! Must try the Fundido sauce! It is truly the best compared to any other Mexican restaurants around here and even compared to ones in California. It's amazing!  The Pollo Fundido meal is my favorite meal here. It's a good sized portion--my husband and I share this meal and are completely content.   They are self proclaimed as having the best margarita in town and my husband agrees. Lots of parking around the back. Something we just recently realized.   Enjoy the man-made lake with ducks, fish, turtles and an area to feed them too. Perfect entertainment quality if you bring children. Beautiful ambience."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I feel as if I wasn't at the same restaurant as the other reviewers.  Yes the place is pretty, but the similarities ended there.  Our server seemed uninterested, and slow would be an understatement.  It took 15 minutes just for the drink order!  When the food finally came, we sent a shrimp dish back, but it could've been 3 more.  Although one of our guests enjoyed his food, I would say we are not going to be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had heard so much about Cavecreek went out there today. Stopped to eat at El Encanto, being from New Mexico USA the food was different than I'm used to but very tasty. I would definitely eat there again. Beautiful place."}
{"text":"Enjoy the food and the view, great service every time I have gone, thank you"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was great... But the atmosphere was wonderful!  Also, it's always nice seeing the manager sweepings floors & refilling waters."}
{"text":"Had a pretty bad experience, and we didn't even get to eat there!   We checked in: two adults and a not-yet-walking toddler. I specifically said 2 and a high chair. I saw the hostess write \"3\" in her sheet. We chose first available seating. We were told the wait is 25 minutes.   A few minutes later, our pager started buzzing, and I hope it's a fair assumption that we were next to be seated. So we made our way to the host's desk and we were told we'll be in a booth with no high chair. We said we need a high chair, so the hostesses put us back on the list.   We waited I think at least 20 more minutes, baby started fussing and we're very hungry at this point. When I asked how much longer it would take for us to be seated, I was told there were 6 other parties in front of us! But wait I thought when our pager buzzed the first time that we were next at that point, and we were waiting for the next available table! I guess they can argue that all available tables at the time were booths, but I don't comprehend why we were told there were 6 parties ahead of us. Did they put us back at the end of the line? So we left, we are not putting up with this BS."}
{"text":"Ditto. Wonderful ambiance, good place to bring guests, worth the drive. I've had the Seafood Enchiladas (3.75 stars) and the Pollo Fundido (4 stars). What brings El Encanto up to a solid 4 stars overall is that ambiance. Relaxing, romantic, quaint, peaceful, blah blah blah.  Only sour note is that both times I've been, the service/servers weren't that impressive. But not horrendous enough to keep me away."}
{"text":"I love this Mexican food!!! The atmosphere is even better though. They have a beautiful pond that you can sit next to and look at the fish and the ducks. They have string lights that they turn on at night so it makes for a very pretty dinner! We ordered the sampler platter because it came with pollo fundido, tamales, and taquitos, and we couldn't decide what we wanted so it was perfect! Everything we ate was delicious. The pollo fundido was really flavorful and the chicken inside was moist. Their chips and salsa are really good too. They give you a trio of salsas but the best by far is the green salsa! This place would be perfect for a special occasion dinner, a date night, or just a family dinner!"}
{"text":"Food is average to good. I hated the jalapeño margarita. But the regular margarita was very taste. Being in az I wanted the food to be a bit bette. Cool location."}
{"text":"Dined with a group of 6 last evening. Let's start with positives, the space accommodates large groups, the pond and wildlife make the surrounding unique, and the chips were good and abundant (menu stated we would be charged for chips after the first free basket, but that didn't happen)  Food and service were mediocre. Taco shells, for instance, were fried so crisply that they shattered when you bit into them, leaving all contents to drop to plate. Taste of other entrees was\"off\". Margaritas were overly sweet and not worth the price.   Bottom line is that there are so many good restaurants around, give this one a pass."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican restaurant in the heart of downtown Cave Creek.  Many great dishes and good margaritas.  Very nice ambiance."}
{"text":"I thought this Mexican restaraunt was Great..My bean burrito was delicious. My husband said his good was good also..We went with another couple and they also enjoyed their meals.. When we return to arizona we will eat here again..I thought the prices were also good."}
{"text":"I usually love this place however last time I went the hostess made my son cry, so I will not be returning. We were told there was a wait to sit about 30 mins with 10 open tables in the patio area. I told the hostess my son would like to sit in a table that is open to wait until there is a table...\"we were told sorry I can't do anything about that and \"I guess he doesn't see the ducks tonight\" prompting my son to burst out in tears. We still took him to look at the ducks but the hostess team is pure moronic on how to treat customers with children. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The outdoor portion of this place is cool.  Jic ambiance, fresh air etc... Then it goes down hill.  Worst service ever."}
{"text":"SERVICE: 1 Star  (non communicative, bored, not helpful when asked simple question like 'What comes in this dish'....) FOOD: 4 Stars, Tasted great. we used to go years ago, for the atmosphere - the relaxed, funky setting. I know they're big and 'busy' now...but... does service always have to suffer when something gets 'successful'?..to bad. Food was great...good on ya chef's and person bringing our lunch out to the table."}
{"text":"The absolute best place to go for inauthentic setting with excellent Mexican food. Great for groups comma family and happy hour."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous reviewers below. Definitely a tourist trap, and the food is ok, at best. Margaritas are Blah. Food was boring. Service was slow."}
{"text":"All was going OK until I find out sour cream condiment is extra charge. Mexican food, really"}
{"text":"The ambience is great. Our server was good and efficient. The food was so-so. Not real good Mexican. The two stars is because 3 people in our dinner party got sick off the food. They all had chicken and within a couple hours they were all in the bathroom."}
{"text":"The only reason it's getting three stars is because I grew up on this food and still crave it so I'll go back. That being said, it has gone way down hill and is rarely as I remember and almost never worth the inflated prices. It really bums me out to go somewhere I've been visiting for years just to get price gauged for something that used to be much less expensive larger in portion and higher in quality. I've found foreign objects in my food as well as in my over priced margaritas, I've received awful service and left with a disappointed feeling at least 80%of the time. That being said there are some great staff members there that are quick to take care of these problems the best they can but it's sad that they happened in the first place. I really used to adore this place (that's within walking distance of my home) but now when I'm in the mood for Mexican more often then not I drive into Scottsdale. I hope they get back to the level they fell from, I truly miss \"the way we were\""}
{"text":"My wife and I like to eat here.  We sometimes bring the kids.  The atmosphere makes it enjoyable, from feeding the ducks to music and flamenco dancing, it's a great experience with consistently good service."}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere. The food quality has suffered since we were the last. Ordered fajitas and the beef was ok but the chicken was like rubber. Very few onions and peppers. Other in our party that ordered chicken dishes had a similar experience."}
{"text":"Best margaritas in town!!! We go there as often as we can, the kids love feeding the ducks too!!  Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food! I was starving after the Butterfly Wonderland and needed to eat something before exploring the Aquarium. I almost bought a little deli sandwich from the cafe at the Butterfly gardens but was so happy to have held out, hoping for a better option. On our walk to the aquarium we were pleasantly surprised to find a whole plaza full of attractions and restaurants, and El Encanto was calling my name \"Amandita\".   El Encanto starts each table with a full basket of hot chips and 3 different salsas. For a saucey girl like myself, I was already in salsa heaven! My favorite was the green avocado salsa followed by the spicy red, I wasn't a huge fan of the mild (too much oregano), but that didn't matter because I had 2 awesome other salsas!    For lunch I had a Cadillac margarita (it was a late lunch! Lol) and a small version of the fish tacos. The margarita was good and for $7.50, definitely not a bad price! The fish tacos ended up just being a fish taco, but after stuffing my face with delicious chips for the previous 20ish minutes, I really didn't need more than one. The fish was Mahi which is a tougher fish and the taco shell fell apart on me so it had to be a knife and fork taco, but it was served grilled and with a super flavorful pick de gallo as well as the most delicious rice and black beans. Even though my taco fell apart on me, I was very pleased with my meal and great service from Ronnie. Don't settle for Butterfly garden or aquarium cafeteria food, El Encanto is just around the corner!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice with friends and each time the staff, food and margaritas were awesome. Have tried something different each time on the menu and was very satisfied. Love the duck pond and outside patio area. Very friendly and service inspired staff. Would highly recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 24 with a reservation and manager attempted to give us a fixed menu and made us wait 50 mins extra before telling us so.   Great place/food with horrible management"}
{"text":"Loved the beautiful setting on the patio. Our server was Joe and really it couldn't have been any better. We ordered the jalapeños rellenos and the carne aside burro. The carne asada is the best I've ever had. The meat was tender, flavorful, and lean. The jalapeño appetizer was also very good and spicy. This will be our go to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Jaime totally rocks!!! She knew what had onions in it and how. Never had someone as knowledgable about the intricacies of the menu. We were impressed with her ability to remember all of our altered orders. Also, I'm so boring, I get the same thing at every Mexican restaurant, Chimichanga with Carne Asada. I have been to hundreds of places and this, by far, has the best Carne Asada ever!!! It's tender and smoky. Gracias!!!"}
{"text":"Two things you should know about this place: (1) It's a long drive if you live in Phoenix or the east Valley, and (2) it's worth the drive.  I once took my parents and some family friends. My mom complained the entire drive about how long it was taking to reach. When we finally did, she sheepishly conceded the point. Hah!   The food is good, with a good blend of standard and some unique Mexican entrees. The mood is festive. And the decor and overall setting is what really sets the place apart. Think of a duck pond, palm trees, a grand patio filled with people having a good time, huge windows if you want to sit indoors, and a great misting system if you want to sit outside in summer (but prepare to get ever so slightly wet). If you have to wait for your table, there's a fun, fairly crowded bar area with free chips and salsa. The service has always been friendly and efficient.   Because of the drive I don't go often, but if you're new to Phoenix you should definitely make the time at least once. I often take out of town guests. Cave Creek is an interesting little town to explore on its own."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere, sit outside and watch the ducks and turtles if it isn't too hot. The pond can smell a bit funky in late summer, but the margaritas make it bearable. I like the burro with red and green sauce, hubby likes the chicken fundido."}
{"text":"There  is not large selection of eateries in Cave Creek but El Encanto is a good one.  I started off with a pitcher of margueritas and they were the best.  The queso appetizer was fabulous as was the fresh guacamole.  The pollo fundido was outstanding and the small size was more than enough.  They were able to accomodate our large group.  I will return!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the service is good and so is that atmosphere. The food is lack luster and is just ok mexican food. Nothing to write home about, we mostly just like to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"You guys.  Stop taking this place so seriously.  They have amazing frozen margaritas. You will get drunk. Fast.  The food is good, usually. The plates are so hot that it turns the food into molten lava. Be careful.  The employees are really nice and down to earth.  There is a nasty duck pond that is really gross but my kid loves looking at the ducks and turtles and other birds. One time my friend said she saw a bobcat in there. Awesome.  Free chips and salsa.  A huge place with lots of options for seating.  They got new wooden chairs that are A MILLION TIMES BETTER than the old metal ones. I really reaalllllllly hope they replace the bar stools next. Those things are the worst! When it's the height of season, don't even try to get a table. It's so busy. Just sit in the bar. The bartenders will take care of you!  A wonderful place to go in the summer when you don't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Who knew this little Disneyland-esque restaurant existed in Cave Creek! I've been told by my parents that I came here when I was little but for some reason, I experienced memory-loss, because I don't remember any prior visits. With that being said, I'm mad at my memory for forgetting a cute spot so easily!  I love anyplace with a little atmosphere. The food doesn't even have to be phenomenal if the atmosphere exceeds expectations. When I visit a restaurant, I want to leave reality and enjoy a meal in la-la land. El Encanto provides that.  At this little oasis in the desert, this quaint restaurant is situated amongst cowboy tourist trap central, but there's nothing cowboy about this place. El Encanto provides a fun Mexican meal atmosphere. As you walk in through the courtyard, you notice tables surrounding a large pond of several ducks and swans. Yes swans! As the waitress put it, \"it's great for the guests and especially children...but not so great for me who has to feed them!\" I'm still not sure of the origin for why the ducks are there but it definitely adds to a atmospheric experience! The restaurant has Mexican tile and decor and it provides a fun experience for families, couples on a date or friends!  The food was definitely above par. The margaritas were tasty! We went with a pitcher since we were going to order several and here's a little tip...the waitress said that three margaritas come in a pitcher, but it definitely came out to be more like 4 (maybe just under). So it's definitely worth ordering a pitcher when you compare the price of a pitcher versus the price of an individual glass.  Second up, the guacamole. Delicious! They put cheese on top and it adds a nice little zing to the creamy guac. For my entree, I went for the Pollo Fundido. Here's the thing. It was delicious. Incredibly delicious. However, it was way to fatty and creamy for my waistline. That being said, it was still deliciously and filling. I could barely eat half of it so it might be worth sharing.  I would definitely make the drive to Cave Creek to visit El Encanto again."}
{"text":"One of the best go to places when you're in Cave Creek. Food is great, Margaritas rock! Got to spice up the hot sauce though, it's pretty mild for the tourists! The turtles and ducks in the pond are the best entertainment LOL"}
{"text":"If you're familiar with aviation, you'll be familiar with braking action. For this place I give a \"poor\" braking action report. I just got back from going here on a Saturday afternoon. The place was busy, but not overly so. We were asked if we'd like a seat next to the pond, and decided that a 4 year old would enjoy the view of the turtles wading gently in the pond, and the ducks doing anything possible to avoid the scorching sun committed to frying their little brains after prolonged exposure.  What was not anticipated, however, was the flys. Are you kidding me? I should not be sitting in a restaurant where I'm about to shell out $50 for lunch and have the pleasure of swatting flys while eating. Iraq? Sure. Afghanistan? Definitely. Mexico? Comes with the turf. North Scottsdale/Cave Creek/ Carefree? WTF.... over?   Also not anticipated was the service. There seems to be a conflict between me and my mate on this one. She goes with \"average\", I go with \"tardy\". She's thinking I'm being \"harsh\". I'm  thinking I'm being fair. That said, I just think that the server was borderline lazy. Asked for the water carafe to be refilled, and someone else ended up bringing it sevvvvvveral minutes later, while the water station was literally across from our table. Asked for our salsa to be refilled, he looked at it, acknowledged and walked away. I made a \"bet\" that he would forget. I was not let down. Winner winner chicken dinner. But not quite the win I had in mind. This went on with bussing, refills, etc. He seemed just a bit \"behind the situation\", had poor SA, and was not interested in performing at a high level.   The food was eh. Well. My food was eh. I got the enchilada plate, she ordered the pollo fundito. I liked the fundito. It is Ajo Al's Pollo Con Queso in disguise. It is good, but if faced with Al's or El Encanto, I'll go with Al's every time. The beans were a little heavy on the lard. Like I said, it was just sort of bland-ish all the way around.   Understand, if I were going to Filiberto's, this would be more than adequate food. However, we paid $47 for lunch and dollar for dollar, it sucked."}
{"text":"Youch! Waited for 30 minutes and the place wasn't even busy.. Slow service.. even slower kitchen.. pollo fundido was cold (un-melted cheese, stone cold chicken) and tasted like it had been in the fridge for a while! If the stove is broken or the dishwasher, whatever the problem, you really should communicate that to your guests.  The green pond in the back was kind of different.."}
{"text":"We arrived at El Encanto at 7 for our 7:00 reservation and we were seated at 7:30, it would have been longer but we said we would sit inside.  The server was pretty nice and the margaritas were actually pretty good.  The food was about average except the pollo fundido which were delicious.  The fajitas were alright.  I think it would be more enjoyable at daytime as the lighting isn't the greatest and maybe another item would fit better than the fajitas."}
{"text":"Marissa was our server and she was very informative and efficient. The food was very good and we would definitely go back to try something different. Hubby had a corn rice with mahi mahi and I had the very unique shrimp cocktail with a bowl, of albondigas soup. A friend who was with us had rib eye with jalapeño mashed potatoes and he was not impressed. This one is worth trying again, good margaritas, we has prickly pear and peach."}
{"text":"All I have to say is MOLE SAUCE!!!!! It was the best I have ever had! The small portion of the mole chicken enchilada was PERFECT before a fun night out in Cave Creek. The Prickly Pear Marg was awesome as well! Definitely stop in if you are in town and want Mexican Food!"}
{"text":"this place has a very cool layout. entering from the street, it opens up wide with a wrap around patio, lots of shade from structures and trees, cool foliage, and even a big duck pond with lots of ducks, swans, and turtles.   we were seated immediately and served some very tasty, crispy chips and 3 types of salsa's. i had 2 of the house margaritas which i thought were so good, they went down too easily. we split a green chile tamale appetizer, 1 each, and they were surprisingly very filling and packed with chiles. we also split a fish taco plate, which was mediocre and a little high priced for only 2 tacos with one tiny sliver of fish inside.   the black beans and rice were cooked well and had a great flavor. for out 2 plates, 2 margaritas, and 2 beers, we paid about 50 bucks with tip. our sever, poor guy, didn't smile once and although prompt, was obviously not happy to be at work today.   when the folks come to town, we might have to venture out this way again."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. The rumor is that Immigration raided the place and took the cooks away. Since then the menu has been reduced to a few basic offerings. Too bad, as the setting is kinda cool, but you could find better."}
{"text":"Ambiance? Five stars. A duck/turtle pond in the middle of a beautiful spot? The architecture alone is worth going for. Kids love it. Very romantic. Good margaritas.  The food? Well, I'll just preface this by saying we had just gotten back from Mexico. So we love Mexican food and had some really amazing, authentic meals while we were there.  The food is.....good. Probably the best thing on the menu is the Pollo Fundido. It's like a chicken stuffed chimichanga (deep fried!) and served with this amazing creamy sauce. It's quite tasty. The sampler is also a great way to try several things and is a lot for two people to share. The lunch portions are moderately priced and a petite portion, so a nice option if you're not starving. Our last server, Jill was amazing."}
{"text":"El Encanto will always have a special place in my heart since this is where my husband and I had our wedding back in 2006.  It was our favorite restaurant which also happened to be visually beautiful and so unique.  We love the food, the pollo fundido is the best Ive ever had, the margaritas are outstanding (we had a margarita fountain at the wedding, so fun)  Everything Ive eaten there has been great and the atmosphere is so nice especially if you have opportubity to sit outside.  This was always our go to place for out of town guests as well."}
{"text":"Loved the patio! Food was good. It was super busy, but they had a great 'waiting lounge' close to the bar, that you can get a margarita and chips and salsa while you wait"}
{"text":"The Lamb Barbacoa was one of the best dishes I've ever had in any Mexican restaurant, anywhere!   The lamb was tender and without any fat or gristle (rare for lamb dishes), and the sauce was fabulous. ALL the items in the dish were just right also.  I ordered a roasted Jalapeno on the side, which was delightful.   The chips and salsa were some of the best also (thin chips, and medium, hot and green sauces)  The setting is cool.  We sat overlooking the 'duck pond' watching terrapins or turtles or whatever they are. A great lunchtime experience!  I wonder what it's like at night ...!  I just took at look at the 'take out' menu, and it shows that they have two other locations - one in Fountain Hills ... so I'll try the FH location next!"}
{"text":"Updated, June 2016:  Stay away in the summer, low staff, quality of food diminshes.   I have been here a handful of times and my most recent visit was very good!  I enjoy the variety of salsas provided with the chips and the chips are tasty and not oily like many Mexican food restaurants.  I also appreciate being able to order a small or large dinner plate for the items I enjoy eating.  Sometimes a small plate is just enough so I don't have to order a big plate of food that I end up taking home and not eating after I paid for it, so a nice option.  The restaurant itself it not like any other and is truly an enjoyable atmosphere.  If you have out of town guests, this is a great place especially when the weather is nice and you can sit outside next to the small water pond and enjoy the AZ climate and fresh air."}
{"text":"We love taking out-of-town guests to El Encanto for the \"experience\".  Charming, funky Mexican patio feel (complete with a pond filled with duck, geese and turtles), in general the staff is great (we have had one or two surly servers in the past, but we never see them again, so evidently management takes care of this) a mariachi band or guitarist strolling amongst the tables (my only issue with that is what's the etiquette?  Should we stop eating and look attentive when they stand at our tableside and play?  Do we tip?)  And the food is GOOD!  I love the three sauces that they bring to the table with chips---just pour those into a soup bowl and give me a spoon.  Chips are typical Mex restaurant fare---a little greasy and tasteless---probably out of a box from Chicago.  We haven't had a unenjoyable meal there yet, although I wish they served a vegetarian version of a chile relleno---why do people insist on ruining cheesy goodness with meat?  But maybe I just need to ask.  DH loves the Pollo Fundido and the Carne Asada.  I am also a fan of the Enchilada de Pollo con Mole.  It's fun casual, and come hungry!"}
{"text":"Great place! Great atmosphere. Great service. Great prices and... great drinks!!! Plus it's in Cave Creek what more reason do you need to go. It's also fun that you can sit outside if your in the mood and if there's a chill they provide these great hand made blankets. The live musicians walking around is super cool too. Get the Guacamole....."}
{"text":"I'd like to know who voted this place as having the best Margarita? Um,  that didn't even come close to even being good. When you can see clear through the glass and it has absolutely no color then that's not a good margarita. The Pollo Fundido is probably the best thing that they have on the menu and the salsa is good but it's not that good. The atmosphere is really great but I think they need a little work on the drinks. I'm giving it three stars because the food is good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. A bit far for us, but the margaritas are super! The food is great as well. Good place to take family or a group of friends."}
{"text":"Our meal at El Encanto in Cave Creek was a disappointment to say the least. Other than the lakeside ambience, I would not recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy. We ordered the fajitas, and honestly, the onions and green peppers were plenteous and tasty, I suppose,  but we had to search for the steak and chicken. The sides and condiments were okay, but nothing to write Home about .  This was a pretty pricey meal, so you hate to leave hungry. Bummer."}
{"text":"Mass produced Slop !  Flavorless.  Presentation lacking !  Don't waste your time.  Had the Seafood enchilada and chicken mole enchilada both were not worth mentioning.  Chips were good, salsa 's were flavorless with a little heat.  I must say nothing on anyone elses plates looked any better.  Waitress didn't really have much of a personality either.  Still left her 20% though."}
{"text":"I come here with the wife often and never leave disappointed.  I always seem to enjoy the fish tacos the best.  They are lighter and you don't leave stuffed because their portions are very big.  One word to the wise is not to order the margarita by the pitcher.  My wife and I did and it doesn't taste better as the drink goes on.  Too watered down and not a good taste.  We also sat inside for the first time and enjoyed it a lot.  Great Mexican place north of the 101!!"}
{"text":"I travel to Scottsdale frequently  - 3 times a year and each time I go here to eat lunch/dinner. The service is great. The food is so good and the atmosphere is worth the drive it too.    It's the perfect place to kill an afternoon drinking alcohol, staring at the pond and eating their chicken.     I eat Mexican frequently so for me to rate this place so highly - they had to be good.  If you are on the border about this place - just go- based on the other reviews - you're likely to love it then hate it."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. Every visit more magical than the last. Great food and great service. And this place has an atmosphere that you CANNOT replicate."}
{"text":"What a wonderful atmosphere!  And the service was perfect!  Our waiter was a very pleasant young man named Mike and he made our dining experience a true pleasure.  The only reason we aren't giving the 5th star is because the food was a bit bland compared to the descriptions in the menu.  We'll definitely come back and try again!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and service was excellent.. one problem was a couple we were with we're charged for every refill for their drinks of cola and Ice-T.. ended up being almost $10 for the drinks only one time a refill was ask for.. the rest report automatically by our server... I was so happy my hubby and I just got water.. I thought that was ridiculously expensive and should have been warned that refills were extra..."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Counting Crows - A Long December)  At El Encanto and there's reason to believe Maybe this meal will better than I had I can't remember the last drink that I had as I was eating Now the service go by so fast  And it's one more day up in Cave Creek And it's one more order of Fundidos If you think that I could be Yelping, I wish you would   El Encanto is a long staple of the Cave Creek area.  Nestle along side all the biker bars and niknac shops; El Encanto brings out some pretty darn good Mexican food.  I came here after a short hike with some friends.  We went to the bar for some Bloody Marys to start, which was okay; I didn't really care for the mix.  As we sat I ordered a beer and enjoyed the view.  Inside the restaurant is a beautiful pond with some ducks, turtles, and koi fishes.  This would definitely be a romantic setting during the evenings!    I continue to ordered my meal and my friend recommended the Pollo Fundido; what appears to me as a chicken chimichanga doused with warm cheese on a bed of Mexican rice.  Overall, the dish was definitely cheesy!  The chicken was still warm to the bite as it well wrapped with a tad bit of crispiness while the oozing cheese soften it slowly.  To be honest, not my cup of tea, though I can eat cheese; just not this much.  I wanted some spice to give it another element; maybe some peppers.    In the end, El Encanto is quite a drive for me, but they have 2 other locations around the valley.  I think it's definitely a nice date night to check out the view and have some wine.  As for the food; it's up to your palate.  I for one, will keep trying! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We love the plaza-type environment, watching ducks in the pond. Food is good. We've been here several times and keep coming back."}
{"text":"Like general Mexican vibe but they need to CLEAN this place..looked grungy and unhealthy/unclean. Service slow and indifferent to their patrons. Perhaps the snowbird influx has spoiled management. Get real people..the REST of us eat out ALL year..not just Nov-March!"}
{"text":"We were taken there by friends who are local to the area. The venue is perfect for a visitor destination. Beautiful little pond in the center of outdoor dining area.   Sadly the Sunday buffet was totally lacking. Little choice and poor quality. Did not feel very clean.  Indifferent service.   Bill for four buffets was $100.00 with tip.   Plates served from the menu looked pretty routine at nearby tables. Enchiladas, rice and beans. Rice, beans and enchiladas.   Sure hope this is not the best Carefree has to offer. It's a long drive and top dollar for so-so Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty and a pretty good value. The mole reminds me of my mom's because it is sweet. My bffs carnitas burrito was good too. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Everything here is AMAZING.  The food, the service, and especially the scenery if you sit by the duck pond!  I've been all over Mexico, and El Encanto is some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.  It is unbelievably authentic.  This is a great date place, or a place to take out-of-towners, or  place to go to \"just because\"!  Well worth the drive from Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Everyone raves over the pollo fundido...its awesome, but the rest of the food is great too. Cheese enchiladas are bomb!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting the restaurant last night. Can also say it will probably be my last.  My complaint with this place involved the service, the prices and the quality of the food. We had some family in town and had just finished with an event nearby. Someone suggested we try El Encanto for dinner. After arriving we waited about 20 minutes for our table for 10 which is understandable on a Saturday night. When we were brought to our table we were promptly brought waters and chips & salsa by the bussers. But we had to wait at least 10 minutes for the server to take our drink order and wait an additional 15 minutes before our drinks were delivered.  We ordered our food, it came out in a reasonable amount of time, but my entree was cold. I ordered the pollo con mole enchiladas which though they tasted ok, they were cold. This entree was $14.99 My boyfriend had the \"special\" 5 jumbo shrimp swimming in some chipotle sauce served with veggies and rice. $17.99 Thank god we waited so long for our drinks we filled up on chips and dip.  Then the server had a difficult time splitting our check. We were told the computer wouldn't allow him to split the check any further and everyone's tickets were messed up. He probably should have suspected or at least asked at the beginning if the check was to be split.  On top of it all he added a 20% gratuity.   All in all, I felt that this place was over priced, the service was slow, the food was served cold and the portions did not equal the pricetag. Also, not very accommodating to large party's. One positive thing I can report is that the house margarita was quite tasty - though it was mostly ice."}
{"text":"Was so impressed by this restaurant, and will come back frequently! Staff was friendly and helped me decide my meal ( I couldn't decide because everything looked amazing) and her recommendations disappoint! You can tell they take great pride in their food and business. Authentic food, and amazing atmosphere. Planning to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"AWESOME food, great service, atmosphere was amazing as well ! I would go here on a date night or take family.. All around, it's a pleasant atmosphere... Loved it !"}
{"text":"My whole family was together for the first time in almost four years for my brother's college graduation, and it was a great last-night-in-town dinner.   Service was excellent, ambiance was great. We were greeted immediately after a short walk through the outdoor dining section and past the charming man-made duck pond, and seated immediately after. Our server, Max, had taken our drink orders and brought water and chips within a minute of our settling in. He also took pictures of the whole family together and was friendly and laughed with us.   The food was great -- the recommendations for the pollo fundito are worth listening to! That's what I had, and it was amazing. I was a little unsure about the cream cheese jalapeño sauce before it arrived, as I'm not a huge fan of jalapeños, but Max assured me it was to my tastes, and he was right! I'm desperately searching for good recipes to recreate it when I'm back home in Seattle.  Everyone else at my table had pitchers of the house margaritas, which even I sampled and enjoyed, despite margaritas not being my drink of choice. I had one (well, not just ONE) of the best strawberry daquiris I've ever had.  But here's where El Encanto loses one star. My brother was unimpressed with the slightly hefty price of his pretty small burrito, even though he enjoyed it. Also, my father's beef fajitas didn't come with cheese, and only had two tortillas -- though he did get more when he asked. Not sure if there was an extra charge, but I don't think there was.   Toward the end of the meal, the owner or a manager (Bill), also checked on us, which I always appreciate on a busy Saturday night dinner.   In addition, Robin (one of the hostesses? A manager? She was standing at the hostess station when we walked in and chatted briefly with my mother while our waiter asked the rest of us where we wanted to sit.) gave us a HUGE free fried ice cream to celebrate my brother's graduation. It was delicious and easily enough for all five of us to share after such a huge dinner.   Also the duck pond was awesome! We sat next to the windows with a great view of the ducks, geese, and turtles! The overall atmosphere was pleasant, and the decor was charming, though noise carries inside, and as the dining room filled up, the volume went up. If you want an intimate and quiet dinner, be sure to go in before the big rush and ask to be seated away from the entrance -- outside with the duck pond understandably  attracts the families with loud children.   If I ever find myself in Cave Creek again, I would definitely eat at El Encanto again! I wish I could get Mexican food like this back home in Seattle. Guess I'll have to make it myself."}
{"text":"Been going here for 20'years and just keeps getting better. Highly recommend to anybody in the area, especially if looking for a good place and are from out of town!"}
{"text":"We have been to El Encanto many times and have usually enjoyed the food, although never really raved about it. Tonight was more than a disappointment. The albongas soup although very tasty was barely warm. I ordered steak fajitas. Oh what a disappointment. Over cooked beef, and under cooked vegetables. NO fajitas flavor, no hint of marinade just overdone chewy beef and vegetables barely shown the grill. No wonderful caramelization........no nothing. My husbands a la carte taco (and something else) totally bland and tasteless. Can't even remember what he ate....that's how lacking it was. Sweet and attentive server. The restaurant was slammed and I can only guess the kitchen was in overload  VERY disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife and I followed my folks on Motorcycles to El Encanto.  My folks have raved about this place for a while, so I was expecting a lot - and I was pleasantly surprised! The ambiance is top notch - Very gorgeous inside and out. Huge pond inside with ducks, turtles and fish....Our waitress was very attentive and the food was delicious! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch the worst ever. Few choices. Rice, beans, omelet station, waffles, enchiladas, eggs ranchero, enchiladas, veges. Not able to serve yourself and she asked if I wanted 2 enchiladas they  were cut in 1/3 pieces. Nothing else and I free soda all for $17. we had 2 margaritas and 2 brunches and it was $59 for the variety and qty it was poor to sad. Better off at Taco Bell. and service was very slow considering the place was not busy at all."}
{"text":"One of the most unique places I've been! Very interesting setup, lots of outdoor seating wrapping around a pond. Food was great, I got the pollo fundido and my father ordered the chicken fajitas. Both were great and good portions. Our server was definitely less than impressive but that didn't ruin our experience. I'd definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in the Phoenix metro. Very friendly service and great food. Not even a steak place, but the stuffed poblano Ribeye is the best steak I've had in the Phoenix area. I enjoy the variety of salsas they bring to the table. Another favorite is the polo fundido. My young nephews loved feeding the ducks in the pond. Great patio year round."}
{"text":"While I enjoy the ambiance of El Encanto in Cave Creek, I feel the service is hit or miss and the food is just eh...  I've been on several occasions, most recently this past Sunday.  Perhaps they were short staffed because it was Easter, but we were there for a good 15 minutes before we were acknowledged by our waitress and then it took another 15 to get drinks and we had to request salsa to go with the chips on our table.  Our food took a really long time too...  When you do get your Corona or Margarita, you feel like you're in Mexico - the chips and salsa are addicting!    Go for the ambiance, not the service or the food... and go with a fun group of people!"}
{"text":"Food is not bad - not great.  El Encanto continues the PHX trend of nickel and diming customers for chips and salsa.  Party of 5 gets one basket of chips to share - want another basket of chips with your $100 dinner?  Pay up, they say.  Most meals include  either rice or beans - not both.  Birds in your face?  No extra charge."}
{"text":"Awesome setting! Feels like you're in a Mexican resort in a way!   Great variety of food too!   Excellent portions and spot on price."}
{"text":"A. Sunday afternoon drive brought us here for a real get-away from our small world! Wonderful view though reflection less glass to pond and waterfall with ducks and turtles, delicious house margarita, and real, tasty Mexican food.  A great getaway!"}
{"text":"Good chips and salsa, like that they give you 3 different salsas. Both their beans are vegetarian, awesome. I recommend the black bean and cheese burrito enchilada style. Some people like the outdoor seating but the smell of the duck pond is pretty sick."}
{"text":"This is one of the prettiest places to dine in the Phoenix Metropolitan area. Someone once told me that historically the place had been a brothel in the 1920's. It has kind of a Shangrila Hacienda feel to it. There is a little pond in the walled courtyard/outide dining area stocked with waterfowl, and on several occasions I have seen a wild Great Blue Heron inside! When my parents came to visit from Massachusetts I chose a hotel destination close to this place because I think it really feels like a vacation in here! The food is pretty good. They have this deep fried Machacca and grilled green onion thing that they serve with warm melted cheese and hot tortillas which is kind of fun for a group. I like the Rellenos here. They have picadillo in them. The bar area is large with a nice fireplace and well stocked with a good roasted tasting salsa and chips, as well as plenty of icewater pitchers while you sometimes have to wait for your table. Very picturesque and great for photo-ops or possibly a wedding party or something. Not the most incredible food on earth, but neither is it ever disappointing, and the view here at sunset is like magic."}
{"text":"We arrived and were given a wait time for 15 minutes, my guest, mother and I heard this as well for our small group of three for first come first serve seating. We saw groups move as well. When I asked to verify the wait time we were told an additional 35 minutes. Terrible service and first experience."}
{"text":"Neat place.  But you must have reservations.  Wow, lots of people, especially on a nice weekend.  We didn't reserve and waited an hour for a table.  Unique water feature, very large restaurant.  Food was really good, but I'm not a mexican food snob, so others may have opinions as to better.  Well worth the price, which seemed reasonable.  I recommend, but again, call ahead!"}
{"text":"We just keep coming back to it, even when it's almost a 30 minute drive from our house. Love their coctel de camarones (shrimp cocktail) - great appetizer to start off with. Always fresh and plenty of shrimp, and you get a huge basket of chips & 3 kinds of salsa on the side, which are pretty yummy. We usually share an entreè since their portions are really healthy sized and we can barely even finish one between the two of us. Last time we shared the Chicken Queso Fundido, super cheese and delicious. Love the view when sitting nearby the surrounding tables by the pond, great service and would definitely go back a few more times!"}
{"text":"POLLO FUNDIDO PLEEEEEEEASE!  I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews for El Encanto. I would agree that it can be somewhat pricey and the birds can be a bit much (especially when people feel the need to feed them from their tables), but I actually really like this place.   My boyfriend brought me here when we first started dating and we come back on a regular basis. The service isn't always great, but they do their jobs and I've never had any big problems. I love the unique atmosphere here, even if it is a tad bit cheesy. It is completely unexpected in the middle of the country-western Cave Creek. The inside of the restaurant is starting to look a bit run-down, but the old vibe kind of lends itself to a somewhat authentic Mexican feel. I particularly like getting a table outside during the warmer months, or inside by their floor-to-ceiling windows. It's also a fun place to bring out-of-town guests.   I have to admit that I have only ordered one meal here: Pollo Fundido. It is one of my favorite meals of all time and I crave it on a regular basis. It is so good that it almost bumped them up to 4 stars. I don't even need to look at a menu. Their chips and salsa are also decent and I know my boyfriend likes their fish tacos.   All in all, El Encanto is by no means a place to rave about, but I am happy to make the trip up from time to time. The Pollo Fundido totally makes the drive worth it."}
{"text":"I really really want to love this restaurant.  It is a really neat little place with a great atmosphere. It is right by our house.  The only problem is that the food never tastes the same.  One time the burrito is simply amazing.  The next time we go it's awful!  More time than not the house margarita tastes like dish soap."}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food ever eaten so over rated. Setting is nice nothing tasted good."}
{"text":"Love taking out of town guests to this place-the ambiance-funky, different, huge space with a very old Mexican vibe. The food is just okay-but drinks and atmosphere are so great that it makes up for the difference. Huge pond with fish in the center of the restaurant, lots of old Mexican tiles, iron patio furniture and just a really nice atmosphere for a family gathering or celebration. Highly recommended if you are looking for a place with character and just a little bit different than the usual mall restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great.  If you love to sit outdoors and enjoy some wildlife you will defiently want to check this place out.  You must also get a pitcher of the frozen margaritas.  You will feel good after just one glass.  The steak fajitas rock too.  Great atmosphere, great service.  Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Here on Good Friday and the restaurant wasn't very busy, but we were seated for easily 10 minutes and the host brought chips, but we never met a server -although several were around.   A table that arrived after us was greeted before we were and, ultimately, we decided to leave.   We have had great experiences at both the original El Encanto and El Encanto Dos so this was a major disappointment."}
{"text":"Yum, best fajitas ever! Great atmosphere, music, location by the aquarium.  Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not the best service-  We were not greeted once were seated at out table or offered drinks till 10 minutes. I had to get the manager's attention, who could not find our waiter. The manager got our drinks and checked us out.   Food- Decent selection of salsas, however the hips would've been better if they were warm. Frijolles Charra were much spicier than indicted on the menu, so watch out.   Atmosphere- One OF THE BEST"}
{"text":"3 out of 4 of us got one of their specialties, pollo funtado, and we all loved it.  The sopapillas are a great desert to share."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab Mexican food.  The food is good and it is fun to see the ducks and turtles!"}
{"text":"We hit this place periodically.  The food is good and the service is typically good.  It's very popular to sit out on the patio during the winter and spring months in Phoenix,  Pollo Fundido is one of our favorites and I also love the mole enchiladas (in fact, I had some just last night!!).    One point of irritation - when booking a reservation for a party of 12, we were told that there was a 2-hour limit on the table.  I get it, you want to turn over tables, etc. - but it does not make guests (including a large group who are coming to spend money in your restaurant) very welcome.  Agree or not, it left us feeling kind of like we were told to eat and then get the hell out.  Unless service is slow, I don't believe I have ever sat in a restaurant for more than 2 hours anyway, but I found that being told that there was a table time limit a bit irritating.   It won't stop me from going back because we love the food and atmosphere.  It's a good place to bring out-of-town guests when they are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Delicious frozen margaritas. Wish the food were a bit better and they had healthier options"}
{"text":"So totally average at best.  Service was really bad and have had better Mexican food at taco bell"}
{"text":"First time here.  Pleasantly surprised with the combination of great food, excellent service and overall ambiance which includes live music provided by an accomplished guitarist.  My table had a view of the patio area and a pond with water features along with a family of ducks. Definitely a place to go go for that special occasion."}
{"text":"Food is good enough, but the lack of cleanliness of the restaurant leaves me grossed out. We've been there multiple times where the silverware or plates look dirty. Also, when you ask for a straw the server will bring it out to you in their hands. So gross!"}
{"text":"One of top 3 Mexican food restaurants I've been to. Awesome margaritas and enchiladas. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place runs normally, but it was quite a nice experience this weekend when we went for a wedding. The food was great, and its really amenable to kids since there is a duck pond with a quarter machine for the food.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"We went there for Sunday brunch. You can't order from the menu Sunday morning so it's either the Sunday brunch buffet or ... go somewhere else to eat. It's $15 per person for the buffet and there's a nice selection. The huevos rancheros was pretty good but a little bland as was the chorizo & eggs scramble. I suspect it's for the typical tourist's palate. The salsas and pico de gallo also had little or no bite. The food is filling and there's fruit, breads, flan and even salad to choose from so there was variety. It's a little expensive for what you get I think. And it would all be pretty ordinary if not for the big pond with green water with ducks and turtles that contributed to the ambiance. (Don't look too closely into the water because there are gross things in there that will make you lose your appetite.)   We sat out on the patio, the weather was nice and mild and the pond was \"interesting\" and despite the color, not smelly. I enjoyed the live music too. I've never been here for happy hour but I suspect having drinks here is fun. I'd probably come here again for the brunch since the food is predictable and plentiful and the location is convenient for us. If you go, just don't expect it to be anything but average."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean atmosphere. Good tasting food.   Wifey had the cheese enchilada. I took the safe route and ordered the beef fajitas. I've been to mexican owned restaurants, and the fajitas at El Encanto have been the most flavorful. Tender beef with nicely spiced veggies.  Our server, Alexander, even took the liberty to get my margarita fixed. I didnt even have to ask."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a margarita and was hoping for an appetizer of ceviche. Unfortunately they didn't have ceviche on the menu so we opted for the chips and salsa and . They came with 3 different salsas and were fine. The margaritas on the other hand were absolutely horrible. Apparently they are pre-made and they were so sweet I couldn't even drink mine. When I requested a glass of wine instead the bartender offered to make me another one (by hand this time) and even it was not very good. The place was pretty empty and I was surprised that being the only ones at the bar we still had to get the attention of the bartender each time. Don't think we will return. I did like the sink in the women's restroom though!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Waitress refilled our drinks (soda & an iced tea)  without us asking.  Was charged $2.50 for each refill!"}
{"text":"We typically love El Encanto and have been there countless times over the past years.  It is one of the \"must do\" places we take all of our out of town guests.  Service is typically outstanding.  It is by far one of the most unique places in the Valley when it comes to ambiance and a place I thoroughly enjoyed showing guests.    So here is why I am beyond disgusted by everything El Encanto right now.  We had RESERVATIONS for Saturday night (middle of summer, although it has taken me a little time to sit down and not leave a scathing biased review).  Upon showing up, they made us wait for more than an hour before they suggested that we move to the waiting room.  We eventually moved into the side waiting room out of the way and out of sight.  Somewhere along the way they informed us (way after the fact) that we would have a limited menu with 5 total food choices to select from due to the size of our party.    After waiting for more than an hour, when one of the members of our party went to find out how much longer, they told us our reservations were cancelled.  The manager refused to talk to us and they would not even make eye-contact with us.  Needless to say, El Encanto lost more than a large party that night.  I will not go back again anytime soon nor will I recommend this place to others moving forward.  This was beyond bad business and tacky.  It pains me to share this but bad business is bad business."}
{"text":"Good food using fresh ingredients. Definitely a unique dining experience. Mexican architecture with trees growing through walls, a pond with ducks in the middle of restaurant, outdoor seating inside!? We did experience a brief windstorm that forced us to cover our food from dirt and dust, nevertheless, our party of five definitely enjoyed the dining experience."}
{"text":"Great margaritas. Nice atmosphere with seating outside around a small pond. Service was good.   I ordered a chimichanga with extra rice and shredded beef. The beef was ok but they need to Dd cheese and possibly some sort of sauce. This was the first chimi I've had that was dry.   Give it a shot. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST mexican food I have had, ever! And that's saying alot from someone who was born and raised in Texas. Not only was the food great, but it was set in a terrific atmosphere. The restuarant was built around a lake where ducks hang out while you dine. This is a must visit if you are ever in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This is place is amazing. I have only been to the el ecanto dos up until this point. The original el ecanto is beautiful and surprising, it has a large pond with ducks and the seating area is huge.  The waiter came very promtly, kept out chips and salsa full. Our food came out very quickly, I ordered the pollo fundido and I have to say I have been dreaming about it since, so delicious!  The ambiance was awesome and the people there were great, definately check this place out."}
{"text":"They are upstairs in the development surrounding Odysea.  The food is tasty and the drinks are well mixed.  We went in when they were having a free Saturday evening children's movie in the open area so it was a little loud to sit on the patio.  When we got there only a couple of tables were occupied.  By the time we left it was over half full.  It's good to see they are attracting traffic.  We had the charro dip, meatball soup and rellenos.  The starters with chips are filling.  I love their lamb and their skirt steak with potatoes is very good.  It's easy to park in the back parking lot and walk directly to the restaurant.  If you're in the area near Talking Stick it's a great place to check out."}
{"text":"If any one knows of a restaurant in the PNW like this with the amazing pollo fundido on the menu pleaaaaaaaase let me know!!!! I have had this once and haven't stopped thinking about the food or scenery since! I have googled every single Mexican Food restaurant in Oregon and have yet to find anything like this dish. My dad may live in Arizona but the reason I come back next time is for this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"All the other nearby restaurants were closed so we decided to give this a try. An unexpected great find! We were lucky.  I love good mole.   Unfortunately it is hard to find on many menus.  And even when I find a Mexican restaurant that has mole it is often too bitter for me.    I asked the server what he thought in terms of whether the mole sauce was bitter or not.  On his own suggestion he went to the kitchen and brought me a side so I could taste it and see if I liked it. I loved it! I really enjoyed not only the enchiladas with mole but also fantastic service from the moment we walked in."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Arizona is El Encanto.  I enjoy the location - Carefree is awesome - and they have done a nice job with the indoor / outdoor areas.  The margaritas seemed a bit shy of liquor, but the food is amazing.  The tortilla chips are not greasy and the three salsas tasty.  The fundido is excellent and portions are plentiful.  I wish they had this restaurant in St. Louis."}
{"text":"Ambience is very casual, wear whatever.  The food is really, very good.   The service was not bad.  However, the portion size and the drinks are measured tightly and aren't worth the money. We ordered the pitcher of margaritas twice ( Cadillac and nasty) they were mostly ice.  They bring your cups filled with ice as well.  So in reality you end up with 2 drinks. When asked about this the server said its all measured if you ask for less ice the pitcher won't be full.  We also ordered the lamb there was five 1/2\"X 1/2\" cubes of lamb the rest was sauce and a few floating veggies.  Delicious but measured like you're in a socialist camp. Both not really worth the money, but good.  This was the consensus of the 6 of us at the table."}
{"text":"Grew up in this old western town, love the service, food, and beautiful latin atmosphere.  This place is perfect for a typical night date or even a nice afternoon delight! I would suggest ordering the Pollo Fundito, it is the most popular item to order on the menu!  The charm and unique layout of this restaurant is perfect for any occasion."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food & pitcher of Margaritas is a must here!!! Best margarita you will ever have.. Promise!!!"}
{"text":"Can I just say I love El Encanto.  I took clients there for lunch the other day.  They are down for the 'Season' from Chicago.  They were just enamored by the atmosphere.  Yes the birds can be bothersome, so don't sit by the pond!  At any rate, the service is always good, the food is fresh and piping HOT.    My favorites are the Chili Verde and the Pollo Fundito!  YUMM!  The Chili Verde is slow roasted pork smothered with green chili...so good!  The Pollo Fundito is a chicken burrito smothered in queso blanco and run under the broiler...double YUMM.  It's a bit kitchy, but the service is consistent, the food fresh and tasty, and the whole El Encanto story is charming.  When you are in Cave Creek, Go, no RUN to El Encanto and don't forget the margaritas...so good!"}
{"text":"Great salsa and margaritas. I am definitely going back if I am ever in the area again. Amazing inside!"}
{"text":"I am thinking that the draw to this place is the pond with turtles, ducks and fish.  The water is a bit scummy but charming.  The food is average, not especially tasteful nor spicy.  It is good for atmosphere.  My hubby even left some food on his plate which is unusual.  Breakfast is better a lunch or dinner meal is questionable."}
{"text":"the first thing that hits you as you walk into this vast size restaurant, is the smell of dirty indoor/outdoor pond.  i could see how some might find it cute, but it was smelly and dirty.  we got a nice  indoor table for 4 with a view of said pond. we paid extra for top tequila in margaritas - disappointingly warm and tasteless.  food portion of taco bowl, so small it's ridiculous - but steak in it was fabulous.  chicken not so much.  steak fajitas amazing (same steak).  guac. and salsas bland and meh... nice server/man."}
{"text":"Came in for Father's Day lunch. Being the second time here it gets worse with each visit. I like a ambiance but the food can't improve the place. The bill for 3 came to $72.00 seems to me that they need to bring up the quality to match the price."}
{"text":"Good food, but the service was excellent! Jamie was very friendly, always kept the chips and drinks coming, checked up on us every once in a while and put up with our crazy kids! Great representation of the business!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by after a visit to the Aquarium. It was a restaurant that was open and we were a little skeptical at first. Because there was hardly anybody else in there. I think this was because they were about to close. The wait staff was extremely friendly and wasn't upset that we came in an hour prior to closing. We sat down and took a look at the menu and were instantly intrigued. There was an appetizer that had sheet melted cheese and shredded beef on top of it that was absolutely phenomenal. A friend ordered the pollo fundido and loved it.  I ordered the carnitas burrito and it was amazing. And another friend ordered the green chili burro and it was great. The sauces that came out with the chip we're okay but left a lot to be desired as far as flavor. We had about three baskets of chips before dinner came so by the time our food was there we couldn't eat it all. I would most definitely recommend coming to this restaurant especially if you order the melted cheese appetizer."}
{"text":"My family went to a late-night wedding rehearsal dinner here, served buffet-style. Our rather large party was seated on the patio. The kids had a blast, feeding the ducks and fish. While the pond was a bit... 'pond-y' smelling, I guess - it IS summer... it wasn't obnoxious and did not reach our tables. It was a very relaxing and inviting atmosphere.   Chips and salsa were ok, as were the salad, and the small tastes I took of the enchiladas and tacos. The chicken & steak fajita meat were awesome. I had to break my low-carb resolve to have some of the pollo fundido, though, and was glad that I did. It was really, really good. Really good.   Service was excellent. I've read the other reviews, where service is frequently panned. Our experience may have been better, since we had dedicated servers. They were on the ball, though.   Good tourista place, and I hear they do a pretty nice breakfast. Not really sure I'd consider it romantic, but could be, for some people. I'd take the fam again, when we're up in that neck of the woods."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars purely for the reason that there's a duck pond in the middle of the restaurant which keeps my kids entertained while my husband and I finish our meals. The food is good too. Hubby loves the fish tacos and you can't go wrong with the burritos! They have fries and chicken strips for the kids that aren't quite into beans and rice yet. We come here at least once a month!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, hard to find a good Mexican Restaurant in the Phoenix Area.  I think I found one here!  The decor was great!  Beautiful pond and geese with the authentic Mexican blankets and tile.  It was like Wonka's Chocolate Factory...  Looked small from the outside then opened to this huge area on the inside!  I ordered the tequila shrimp dish.  5 or so big shrimp and yummy veggies on the side.  3 different salsa types with hot chips.  Service was average + but not out of this world.  Prices were reasonable I guess...  Could always be a bit lower, especially with this location being a ways out.  It was pretty full on a Thursday night, however.  After I finished my meal, I understood why!"}
{"text":"A savory meal, which was reasonably priced. The small enchilada dinner ($10) was portioned larger than expected.  Every item was tasty and not overtly greasy."}
{"text":"My family and I just Celebrated my Mom's Birthday at this Restaurant, we have been here many times before, we love the Ambiance, and the food is pretty good,  I got the abondigas soup, it was just ok, the Chicken & Steak  fajitas were good, their enchiladas were just ok, also!  Our mistake is that we didn't make a Reservation, and were told we would have a hour and a half wait to sit outside, so we decided to be seated inside, they asked us if our entire party was there, I said no, that they would be here shortly, I was told we could not be seated, because our entire party was not here, I have never been to a restaurant where they couldn't seat us until everyone in our party had arrived, normally they ask you if you would like to be seated now or wait, we also were told our party of 7 would not be able to sit together, we would have to sit at tables across, which did not make any sense!   Luckily, there was a couple that left a table that accommodated 7 people so we were all able to sit together.this is a beautiful Restaurant, it is a shame they were not accommodating for our large party, our waiter did make up for some of our Dissapointment !"}
{"text":"Ive been coming to this place since 1995, sure places change a little but whenever I go I always get a shredded beef chimchunga, even though they took it off the menu they still make it, all you have to do is ask :)  ducks are friendly and sometimes you see turtles in the pond which is really cool for kids.  sitting inside by the large windows is very interesting especially if its sunny the water just glistens into the windows while youre eating.  They do have a nice waiting area outside with a fire pit they sometimes light if its hilly out during the winter or nighttime.    Drinks are hard which I like, I hate going some place, paying for a drink and getting some watered down thing they call a margarita......  Like I said ive been coming here for over 20 years, even when they were remodeling the car inside...this place never disappoints me.   there is misters outside during the summer with added shading to keep the sun off you and there are heaters during the evenings.  great accomodations especially when y late father who was quadriplegic would come they would always be courteous to him and never bat an eyelash when he asked for his food to be put on his plate because it was specific for him to be able to eat..  love this place  fingers crossed I can eventually bring my kids here!!!! :))"}
{"text":"LOVE the frozen margaritas. We got the large pitcher and oh my- they were great! Such a unique and fun place to go. A pond on the inside/ patio area. Super authentic looking and nice service. They filled up on a weekday for lunch, so I'm glad we got there closer to 11am. I loved the shrimp tacos I ordered."}
{"text":"This place has seriously gone downhill in the last 10 years. Remember when the menu had some interesting dishes on it and the staff was actually nice? Remember when the salsas actually had some flavor--seriously what is up with the green gunk that they call salsa...what IS that stuff??  Unfortunately, my recent visit ended up with me returning my food to the kitchen...I had to walk it up to the kitchen because our waiter never returned. I was a few bites into eating a taco salad--veggies and beans only--and came across a piece of super-greasy gristle in the grilled onions. Listen--I've worked in a kitchen on a grill--if you don't clean the grill well, you end up giving people crap like what ended up in my salad. It wasn't a piece of meat recently cooked--that gristle had been on the grill for awhile, drenched in oil over and over and moved around on the grill.  So, off I go to the kitchen to complain about the fact that they didn't clean the grill. Finally after standing there for a few minutes, a waiter finally got the manager for me. Guess what the manager said....wait for it.....  \"They do their best to clean the grill.\"  What?? Excuse me??  #1, getting a piece of greasy gristle in your veggie salad is gross, but regardless that's NOT DOING YOUR BEST. Your best is cleaning off the grill! It's called a scraper. Learn how to use it...don't be lazy about scraping the grill. Lazy=crap in people's food. #2, What do you mean they do their best? Do you mean to tell me that you don't have standards of cleanliness back there in the kitchen? (side note...as I was standing there looking into the kitchen, I saw a basket of chips spilled on the floor as well as paper towels strewn under the sink. No one seemed to notice...do these people clean?) #3, Here's what you're supposed to say when someone finds a gross piece of yuck in their food: \"I am SO sorry. That is UNACCEPTABLE. I am going to go talk to the kitchen staff RIGHT now.  I will take this off your bill and I will go get a new salad for you. I will watch them make it and I will make sure everything is done right.\"  FYI--that's not what happened. I didn't eat another bite at the restaurant. I was too grossed out by the filth in the kitchen and in my dish. I will not be going back. Boring/bland menu, inattentive staff, and a dirty kitchen. YUCK"}
{"text":"Good food and margaritas. 1st time here. Nice atmosphere. I like that they give you three types of salsa for chips. I had the Plato de Mexicano. Was more food than I needed, but I ate it all. I will be back. They have a duck pond, with turtles and Koi."}
{"text":"Started off rough with a long 45 min wait.  The front staff said they paged us but we never got the buzz.  Asked for immediate seating and the manager. Richard, the manager came to us, listened to my concerns and was apologetic and said he'd make it right.  After a nice recommendation of the carnitas and chicken enchiladas from our very nice server,  Julia, my daughter and I enjoyed the deepfried cinnamon ice cream topped with whipped cream and strawberries.  The bill came minus enough discount that amounted to a full meal.   Way to make our sour start end with a sweet finish!  Thanks, Richard and Julia.  We'll come back soon."}
{"text":"I tend to romanticize Mexico.  It's a little strange I know, but I always feel that Mexico is one huge hacienda style restaurant on the beach just perfect for day drinking.  This is what El Encanto is to me.  What my preconceived notion of what Mexico should be like.  That may make me a backwards American hill billy but so be it.     I enjoy El Encanto.  I do not get to make it up there as often as I would like since It is about 5 miles past ridiculously far, but when i am there I am always glad I went.  This is usually the place I take out of town guests from the East Coast or Midwest.    The food is good.  I usually get the Queso Guillermo (How does my dictionary recognize Guillermo but not Queso?  That's gotta be fixed.)  It is basically boiling cheese with a few spices and some green onion.  You can add shallots and this beef that appears to be shredded beef that has either been dried or fried, and I strongly recommend that you do.  I have had the lamb, which is ridiculously good, the fish tacos, which are not deep fried as most other places are, and the pork, which is pork and I love pork.  I have yet to have anything there that was not delicious.    My main problem with El Encanto happens to be their Margaritas.  You would expect that a great day drinking mexican spot would have great Margaritas right?  Wrong.  Too sweet, pre-made margarita mix.  This is easily remedied by ordering a shot of Don Julio and a Negra Modelo!  All in all definitely worth going to if you are in the area.  Make sure to laugh when your guest asks the waiter if they have fresh duck or turtle soup on the menu.  They will think they are wildly original and witty."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorites.  The foods is great, the service impeccable and the atmosphere feels like you have just stepped into old Mexico.  The kids love the turtles and ducks in the pond.  We take all out of town visitors to El Encanto to enjoy."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to go. The ducks smell really bad I don't think they ever clean where they poop. There was bird poop all over the table and chairs which the waitress was rude about and said what do you expect it's outside. Really... and I didn't think the food was very good either. Not gonna go back."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. If you like margaritas then ask for one topped with some don Julio tequila."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!   So glad we came across this place.  You cannot tell from the outside how unique and cool this place is.  Food was great, atmosphere and decor are spectacular and a great place for kids.   Eat inside or out the view is amazing and service is excellent.  A must try when your in Cave Creek, we often went right bye it, so glad this time we stopped :)"}
{"text":"BE AWARE: MY WALLET WAS PICKED OUT OF MY PURSE, SUNDAY 6:30PM 6-5-16. The inside chairs are high and easy to hang a purse on. We were in a party of six and chose to sit inside. There were flies around and we were not comfortable from the onset. We keep thinking we should have left at that time.  There was a Hispanic women about 40 yrs old, about 170 lbs with a very, very heavy set white man with red hair at the table next to us. This is key, since we have since read out on the Police Blotters sites that other victims have reported the seeing a a couple with the same close to them.   The tables are very close here. You will have a hard time moving your chairs, and not bumping the neighboring table. I noticed my wallet was gone when I pick up my purse to leave. Checked with the manager and receptionist, no wallet was turned in. My head was spinning and then started to think, maybe it was at the condo we are renting. Upon returning to the condo, no wallet was there, and we began to make calls and canceled all the cards.   Never put your purse on the chair. On you lap is best. When the food arrived the beans and shrimp were cold. So that was disappointing. The chips and salsa were good. But I think as we were diving into the chips, the theft occurred.   We have reported this to the police. At this point I am rethinking my purse type and looking at getting a wallet that is tethered to to the purse or purse wallet combo that goes cross body. We are vacationing from Seattle. But I have keep passport card separate from my wallet. So we are a bit shaken, but ok. Hope this saves you the same pain."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for Mexican food, it's very very good and extremely consistent serving excellent food! We typically sit in the bar area where they've got a great bartender named Monica."}
{"text":"I love going to this place. It has a great atmosphere. I always try to sit by the duck pond. My baby, as well as my tablemates, love to watch the ducks and turtles. There is always some drama with the goose and mallards. Its great. It is like watching the discovery channel.  I give the atmosphere 5 stars.   The food is good. Is it the greatest Mexican? No it isn't. The food is probably a 3. It is good Mexican and I enjoy it. The chips and salsa are good because you get 3 different salsas. I have had the salad fresca with shrimp and it was good. I did not think the shrimp was worth it, and would probably just get it plain next time.   If you are in Cave Creek, you should go here or take out of town guests. There is no atmosphere like it. Plus afterwards you can check out the shops across the street."}
{"text":"Pollo fundido and ducks! And turtles. And geese. And duck-geese hybrids. Deese? Gucks? And friendly service."}
{"text":"After our visit to the OdySea Aquarium we stopped here for dinner and let me first start by saying Hostess Devin was awesome. Thanks girls for the good talk while we waited for a table. Devin's great service alone is what can keep tables full here.  Ryan our server was pretty good say well. He made sure that our drinks where filled.  The food was amazing! I can for sure say we will be back.  At the end of our meal it was get to meet Carrie the owner or manager. She was one of the sweetest down to earth owners I have ever met!  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"We waited 55 minutes with at least 10 tables open the entire time, all spaced throughout the restaurant. 4 random ones were open the entire 45 minutes-fully set. It's super annoying to watch as 2 tops or being sat at 6 tops and 4 tops available everywhere. Anyway, hope the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"My review seems to be inline with most of everyone. I will say that the Chicken Queso Fundido was pretty damn good and the chips and salsa were ridiculously addicting.  The margarita's were eh not my favorite but it was more less for the ambiance and good company were there for. I've heard positive things about the El Encanto Dos, maybe I'll give that location a try sooner or later- or cut my losses and find a better Mexican establishment in that area."}
{"text":"Honestly this was the worst food and service I have ever had in my life. First when the front hostess sat us, he didn't even give us menus and was kind of rude to us when we came in. We brushed it off and sat down with our kids. They served us our drinks and gave us menus. The waiter was nice, but also seem to be goofing off at the waiter station. Every table that was sat long after us had been served food,drinks, and left before we got our food.  We waited about 45 minutes for our food and when we got it, my chicken was raw and my husband's shrimp was also undercooked. I took two bites and literally went to the bathroom and threw up I was so disgusted. I am not a food snob in any way and usually pretty chill about stuff, but raw chicken is just too much.Thankfully they compted the meal which is the only reason they are getting two stars. Do not come here if you have kids or like good tasting food."}
{"text":"This is one  the worst Mexican food experiences I've ever had. The only thing enjoyable was the physical environment. If not for that, I'd give this place one star. The wait staff was kind, but rushed, incredibly inexperienced with basic wait skills and not knowledgeable about Mexican cuisine or Tequila. I felt like I was in a Mexican version of Chuck E Cheese! The food itself was unimaginative, inauthentic, and, though extremely typical, way under par to even the most common chain restaurants. Just an all round bad experience. I guess if you're from somewhere that has few Mexican food offerings, you Might enjoy it. But for better, head to central or south Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food, Margaritas and ambiance that is fabulous! If you are in Cave Creek you need to stop here and make a memory!"}
{"text":"Had the Worst waitress ever by the name of Diana she was beyond rude we wanted to order drinks because two of us wanted to drink and one was a designated driver the manager and the waitress lie to us and said it was a state law that two of us couldn't drink why one was the driver which is totally not true also we tried to let it go OK so we won't drink we said and we started to talk and she interrupted my conversation with my sister and said are you talking about me it got ugly so we asked for another waitress I've beenIn the restaurant business for over 50 years as my sister has for at least 40 the new waitress was very pleasant we ended up giving her a $40 tip on a $44 check I would never go back there again and it's sad because the first time we went we had a lovely experience but not anymore I hope they treat people better than she treated us think twice before you go there"}
{"text":"I love places like this, out of the way and unique.  El Encanto has been around for about 20 years. They have a duck pond in the middle of the patio which is pretty cool. They food was decent and the sangria, good.  If I were in Cave Creek again, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Place is very nice. Not a lot of tvs.  Coldest beer this side of the Mason-Dixon Line! Also not lots of tvs!"}
{"text":"Quaint cantina situated on Cave Creek Road in Carefree Arizona  A Lovely although quite dirty and smelly pond on the very large patio sets the mood Ducks birds and turtles alight upon the protruding boulders and entertain you as you enjoy the chips n salsa Three types of salsa are served A spicy hot , a mild and a mild green salsa The chips tasted store bought and were slightly stale Happily the first basket is served gratis while subsequent baskets will cost you .99 cents per My husband and I presented promptly at 11:00  Here are some of the highlights I asked what the chefs \"Seafood special \" (and I am quoting the menu ) was . Today's seafood special is chicken I tuned out the rest of the description entirely because they lost me at the chicken part Husband ordered the Plato de Mexicana  One beef tamale One shredded beef taco  One cheese enchilada  Served with a large pile of refried beans  Sans tortillas No rice is offered The beef smelled off and looked like it was stewed Perhaps made well in advance and left to linger Husband refused it Since the seafood special was chicken and I do not imbibe I ordered a bean tostada with side of guacamole  Beans are not made with lard  Thank you Thank you Thank you Mine was ok Shell was definitely stale but I was so grateful about the lard free beans Lettuce was good  No tomatoes very little cheese A bland affair until I doused it with the array of salsa so kindly provided Very bland indeed but I would perhaps come back with friends and keep trying for that seafood special jackpot to hit This place looks like it would be awesome for friends  cocktails and appetizers  It is certainly worth another try  I truly wish them well"}
{"text":"This establishment used to have excellent service and food, but sadly this has not been the case the last few times I have visited El Encanto. I am in no means picky with what I eat, and I am not comparing 5 star meals to a place such as this, but their Plato Burro consisted of a few strands of dry meat shoved into a cold tortilla. The rice was cold, beans microwaved, and the server came around to the table once every twenty minutes or so. The only thing that prevents this place from having 1 star in my book is the pretty duck pond, and their salsa is very good. Avoid this place and head somewhere else if you want good mexican food."}
{"text":"We were taken here by our host in Phoenix.  It's one of the prettiest Mexican restaurants I've been in, with a courtyard surrounding a duck pond (there is a sign requesting you not feed the ducks tortilla chips!).  The margaritas were great and my chicken was excellent, as were my partner's tequila shrimp.  Would definitely go back there if I were to visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested my the ladies at Cibola Spa in Peoria. Really good food and service, definitely worth the little detour. Thanks for having us!!!"}
{"text":"Our neighborhood go to place for Mexican food!!  Always great food and service!  There are vegetarians in our family and they can always find something delicious to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch with a dear longtime friend. Great way to start a Sunday and end a weekend!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Expensive tourist trap. This is not Mexican food. From the chips to the sauce, to the glutinous fish enchilada special, blah."}
{"text":"Polo Fundito with extra sauce! Yum. Every time I come here, this is what I eat. It's hard to stray away from something so good.  The margs are fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. All deserts are made in house. House margaritas are tasty, lacking a lil alcohol but still yummy. It's a rustic yet high quality product in the sleepy western town of cave creek, AZ. Carnitas are my recommendation, your local mexi resturants probably don't slow cook the pork like they should."}
{"text":"We visit this restaurant often.    Visitors from out of town love the atmosphere, especially the ducks.    We were looking for breakfast and wanted to go somewhere different.    We had not tried the brunch and thought it was about time.    The brunch was a good value at $14.95 with a large selection of regular menu favorites and a few added bonuses.    The omelet bar, waffles and fresh fruit were a nice added bonus.    It's a great place to take the kids and grandma.    Enjoy a nice margarita or mimosa with your brunch."}
{"text":"The food here is so good!!! I have never been disappointed. The atmosphere is great, there is a pond and ducks/ outdoor seating. Just remember to arrive early since the wait list tends to get long really fast!"}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patio, turtles, ducks birds flying around. The menu has authentic Mexican food that has been great every time. Three kinds of salsa served with chips at your table. Really enjoy the green. Great friendly staff."}
{"text":"Beautiful seating area next to a pond with ducks! Delicious margaritas by the pitcher for a reasonable price. Free chips with three house made salsas that are great. I ordered the enchiladas with red and green sauce - very good. My friend ordered a dish with the white sauce which was amazing! Service was a little spotty."}
{"text":"We somehow end up at El Encanto in Cave Creek at least 3 times a month. It's a great spot for the kids because they love feeding the ducks and watching the turtles. You can buy duck food at the hostess stand for $.50, which the kids love!  They have a ton of large tables so this is a great spot for bigger groups. I would always recommend sitting outside on the patio, inside is just simply not the same. On the weekends and occasional weeknights they have live music and sometimes even dancers.   The food is really basic Mexican food but is very, very good and consistent. The fajitas are done well, the kids love the cheese quesadilla and black beans, and my husband loves just about everything on the menu. Chips and a variety of sauces are served to every table. My only complaint about this restaurant is that the service can be inconsistent. The servers are usually quite slow and forgetful. I'm also not a huge fan of the margaritas here and for a Mexican restaurant that is a huge negative to me. Still, the vibe of this place wins every time and keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"We were told to get the prickly pear margarita and it did not disappoint!  We had to wait a bit since the outdoor patio was closed. But that was a good thing as it was quite chilly outside. One of our party doesn't like very spicy food and the waiter was very accommodating with putting sauces on the side for her.  The food was quick, hot, and delicious."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner after going through the aquarium.   It is a new restaurant and thought we would give it a try.  We were rushed to our seats by a woman and when we asked for a booth she just ignored us.  Our server was quick and did well.  The food was awful.   Very dry and not flavorful.   My tamale was gritty,  the rice was dry and hard.  My youngest son had the pollo fundio and his was not bad.  It was the only thing we took home. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food do not stop here."}
{"text":"I've been coming to El Encanto for just about 15 years now and every time I get the same thing!! Two words: Pollo Fundido. Do you love cheese?!? Do you want creamy cheesiness in every delicious bite of your Mexican Euphoria? Don't even look at the menu. The other things worth talking about are the Queso Guillermo appetizer. Of course, more cheesy deliciousness accompanied by dried shredded beef,  pico de gallo, and a few sliced limes.   The salsa is amazing- try not to fill up!! You must save room for a Chocolate chimichanga with Mint Chocolate Chip Ice cream for desert.   Warning: you will go home with an stomach explosion- but consider yourself warned, and it's 100% worth every bite!"}
{"text":"This place has really good mexican food and a very nice ambience."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The service is fantastic, and the manager, Robin, is knowledgable and committed to excellent service. We had a relatively new server, Max, who absolutely rocked it. He is sensitive to food allergies and knows how and when to ask the right questions. He also knows when not to answer if he doesn't know the answer and will consult the a management to make sure his response is accurate. We were a party of 6 with 3 kids in tow and we all had a blast! Between the great food, the excellent vibe, the awesome service, and the hilarious ducks and turtles, we were one happy party. We will certainly be back for more very soon. Highly recommended to all!!!"}
{"text":"Might be good for tourists but worst Mexican food and Margaritas I've ever had. I  will stick to making our own at home."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times when we've been down to visit. Great food and we love the patio. Dos is good too and last time we were there they still had their amazing appetizer platter, which the original does not have. Atmostphere at Dos is not as nice though."}
{"text":"Nice patio, and interesting salsa with the chips while you wait for your meal, but I can't believe what we got for $70: Four $7 margaritas that had no trace of alcohol and three forgettable tacos. Plus we were charged extra for a side of rice ... Rice and beans are standard sides in Tex-Mex and don't cost extra. That's the way it should be."}
{"text":"They have been here forever and my family and I love the food. There is something for everyone and a great duck pond for the kids. The frozen margaritas are phenomenal and the manager Robin is as sweet as they come. El Encanto feels like going to grandma's house for Sunday dinner without the work. PS. Grandma loves it too!!!"}
{"text":"I'm perplexed by all of the 4+ star reviews for this restaurant.  We were seated on the patio, which was nice.  The food was not impressive at all.  The Pollo Fundido that everyone raves about was dry and there wasn't enough of the jalapeno cream sauce.  I was dissapointed that when my daughter found hair in her food, they still charged us for the meal because they remade her plate.  The problem however, was my daughter had lost her appetite from seeing the hair and couldn't eat her food anyways.    My husband ordered the lamb stew.  The sauce was seasoned well, but the lamb was very dry, just like my plate.  This restaurant was packed, so people must have good experiences here, but as for our family, we won't go back."}
{"text":"The food is great ( I love the Chicken Mole), the margaritas very good, and the service fantastic. One issue was pointed out to the waiter with one meal, the manager and waiter went well above expectations to make things right. I always recommend this restaurant to our friends and family."}
{"text":"After going thru the Town Dump in Cave Creek, AZ we were tired and needed a break. So we stopped at this restaurant, which also has one in Fountain Hills, to quench our thirst and nibble on something. There was four of us so we ordered a pitcher of Corona, margarita for the gals and chips, salsa and guacamole. What made this four star was our barrister, Jennifer, who was so busy but made the time to tend tour needs. She had attest personality and made our visit enjoyable."}
{"text":"another weekend, another group of visitors and once again we found ourselves in Cave Creek.  The rodeo was in town so it was super busy.  This restaurant is situated on a man made pond with big geese. The patio is fantastic, but the wait was too long for our hungry selves and we had a rodeo to get to, so we sat inside. Plus, Kentucky was playing their way to the Final four... no way I was missing that!  Our server was extremely professional, very outgoing and fantastic.  There was something weird in our chip basket and he made a point to find out what it was (just some carnitas meat that got thrown into the fryer, no biggie) and he made to sure explain.    the frozen prickly pear margaritas?  Get them.  I had the carne asada tacos and and they were delicious.  A friend had the fried shrimp tacos, also delicious.  Another friend had the pollo mole... YUM!!  REALLY good mole there.  The restaurant offers half portions, which is much appreciated.    In all, this is a fantatic mexican restaurant with great scenery, great drinks and food, excellent service !"}
{"text":"We were in Cave Creek visiting around town when we stumbled on this adorable little restaurant. The entrance was very inviting, and while we were looking at the menu we noticed the lovely outdoor seating. It was a fairly short wait for a Saturday, and we were able to sit in the nice outdoor seating! We chose some drinks, the guacamole, chips and fajitas. It wasn't a very long wait at all. It was a great meal and nice ambiance, we will be back the next time we are in the area. I will say we got so distracted by taking photos near the entrance for Instagram we forgot our credit cards and to sign the bill! We are so sorry about that once again, I can't believe that happened! We will bring back more friends and family to make up for it next time."}
{"text":"Ambiance is excellent with the little pond that has turtles, ducks, and fish.  Food is great.  Chicken was a bit dry, pork was good, fish tacos were excellent as was the guacamole.  Service is slow. We waited quite awhile for the check and even longer for her to pick it back up to run the credit card. There was a 25 minute wait to get in on a Sunday at lunch time, which was fine. Just the wait time at the end was a bit annoying."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and authentic Mexican Food. Not sure if he is there all the time but they have a guitarists playing Mexican favorites.  Pretty sure he's tired of playing 'La Bamba' FYI."}
{"text":"El Encanto has the prettiest, most picturesque patio!  It is so lovely.  Problem is we didn't get to sit on it unless we wanted to wait for quite sometime.  Everyone in our party was hungry so we opted to eat inside.  It's a large restaurant but inside had very little ambience, not even music playing!  I would like to return and the next time I will wait to sit on the patio.  Food was very good but there are similar Mexican finds closer to us in the valley.  Wouldn't drive up here just for the food, but a nice stop when in the area.  The Mole Enchiladas and Pollo Fundido were favorites."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican fare...great place to bring out of town guest! Loved the beautiful outdoor dinning area around the water. Enchiladas and guacamole were very good and margarita were drinkable!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting place to grab a meal. It is clearly designed as a tourist destination. The decor is over the top. There is a lot of outdoor seating, which is great. The place is deceptively large and quite busy.  We got a good seat right next to the pond outside. Our server was friendly and fairly attentive. We started with a pitcher of margaritas on the rocks. The margaritas had very good flavor.  The chips and salsa they bring out are good. The standard salsa had good flavor as did the spicy salsa. I would have liked more heat from the spicy, but it was good. I did not enjoy the green salsa at all. The chips were sturdy and crisp. We also ordered the Queso Guillermo for a starter. It had great flavor, but was saturated in butter. You will enjoy the flavor but will make you wonder about how much you are shortening your life.  For my meal I ordered the Plato de Mexicano. It consists of a cheese enchilada, beef taco and a red chile tamale. The taco was ok. It is good sized with ok flavor. The enchilada was ok. I would have liked a little more flavor though. The tamale was the best of the three. It was a good sized tamale and was quite tasty. The rice that comes with the meals is ok.  This is a cool place to bring people. That being said, it would not be my first choice for food if I was not entertaining people."}
{"text":"Really good stuff.  Good food, great service and a very cool spot. I will be back on my next visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I ordered the fish taco perfect just what I wanted. I did come on a working lunch so no drinks for me. But my Romeos had beers. It was pretty busy. Waitstaff was nice. When are food came are plates were mixed up so some of my men weren't eating what they ordered but they were fine with it. Dessert time 3 of us ordered flan, chocolate chimis sopapillas. Everything was really good!"}
{"text":"A great find in Cave Creek. The service was fast & very friendly. The food was excellent. Loved having 3 salsas with our chips. The decor was fun & festive. The outdoor seating area was pleasant. Worth the short drive from Scottsdale & fun to walk around after or before at the quirky shops in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Adorable place.  The food isn't anything mind blowing but tasty.  Bar has about five beers on tap.  Drinks are average.  If it wouldn't be for the awesome atmosphere this place would be just another Mexican joint on the block.  Ask for the hotter salsa.  It's pretty good and definitely better then the normal one that they give you."}
{"text":"Prepare to wait for a table but it's well worth it. Huge menu and everything we've tried on there has been yummy. Drinks strong but good, salsa at the table generous and complimentary. Didn't like the guacamole but that may be a personal preference."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch here today before going to butterfly wonderland. It was delicious! Ryan was our waiter; he was great! I had the chicken wrap with fries and my friend had the Quessadilla. They were both really really good! The sauce in the chicken wrap is something I definitely would love to have again!"}
{"text":"Have been going here with my family for years and today's food was very bad. There must be new cooks. The older lady in the front was very rude and needs to understand the business she's in. I hate to encounter people like her. Makes the experience sour!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to this place cause we looked at some reviews and people gave high remarks BUT we were disappointed. The enterance showed promise, but the inside let us down. We sat at a table inside that over looked the pond with the ducks and turtles but there were 5 flys on our window alone. And we sat right next to a fly light. I ordered the quesadilla and added chicken and it was soaking wet with juice from the chicken. The tortilla fell apart because of it be so soaked. We had ordered the app quac but it came with the meal and tasted more like avacado paste than quac. Had high hopes but was let down."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me this long to come eat at El Encanto! I've heard about the cool patio and pond but really didn't understand it until we finally stopped off here for Cinco. Glad we did!  When you first walk in from Cave Creek rd side you are met with a large outdoor pond and see tables next to it. It really reminded me of the River Walk in San Antonio. Really cool and probably the best reason to come here. The atmosphere is really great. Plus we had awesome weather which made the experience even better. The wait was about 20 mins so we grabbed a drink from the outside bar. The pond and weather really made the time to by and before we knew it they had a table ready for us. Too bad they didn't have a table near the water but we still could see if from inside.   I ended up ordering the mole chicken enchilada. I'm a big fan of mole and it is very hard to get right. I'm often hesitant on ordering mole at a restaurant that I've never been too but I was glad I did here. Easily one of the best mole and I wish I would have ordered the large size! Chips and sala were good and had good service too. Ill be visiting El Encanto again!"}
{"text":"Teenage daughter and I went on our way to a Seven Springs adventure. I'll say the food was decent if extremely pedestrian. When the waiter explained the salsa...one is mild, then medium then \"hot\" daughter and I live in downtown phx...this was nowhere near hot.  Aside from no spice it was a lovely lunch.  Good service, quick although it was busy...but I think I might have accidentally found a good wedding venue...."}
{"text":"Food - for me it's a no.  If i were to review the space itself I would give it a five star but the only reason I would return would be for a special occasion invite.  The pond was cool, spent time looking for the turtle so that was a fun distraction from the tasteless food.  The young man who served us was sweet and tried his hardest - training for wait staff needs to improve, it was not his fault he did not know some menu stuff and basic serving skills like bring more chips and salsa for a big crowd! Overall I can see why people like El Encanto but I am a food snob so at the very least food has to be edible and I found the food not so much so.  I left feeling hungry and went on a search for desert to fill the empty spaces."}
{"text":"Free salsa and chips to start/ with three delicious salsas. Allison was our server. Husband ordered the carne asada funditio with beans and rice. Had the same lunch portion.  Allison is a fantastic server.  Was so hungry forgot to take a picture.  Cave Creek is a fun place to visit so it is nice to have a go to place to eat"}
{"text":"If you've ever had good Mexican food then you DO NOT want to eat here. The food was mediocre at best. The only reason for the 2 stars is the service. The host and wait staff were very pleasant, but other than that the food was terrible. You are better off crossing the street to Smokehouse. We had dinner there the next day and it was fantastic. Skip this place and cross the street."}
{"text":"I don't know why some had a poor experience.  My experience was exceptional. I had pollo fonduti and my sister had the chicken chili relleno and we both loved our entree. The chips and salsa sampler was a nice surprised and the chips were thin and crispy.  My margarita was good but lacked a kick.  The waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly.  It was a sunny day and we sat on the patio which made it a great mid day lunch.  I am from the east coast and this place will be a regular for me whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"We went into El Encanto for a late lunch.  The place was clean but service was slow.  We ordered pollo fundido.  The meal was not edible.  I was not sure if it was the sour cream sauce or not.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Good chips and salsa and great margaritas. I had the corn tamales and they were like luke-warm. The tamale itself was sweet. I assume that's how it is supposed to be, but I didn't care for the sweetness. I wasn't overly impressed with this place and probably won't come back. Our waiter was very friendly."}
{"text":"Very happy we stopped off and tried this place. Not sure why more people rate it higher.  Starts off with three homemade salsa's and chips.  Salsa's are great.  The guacamole is just a great as salsa.   One meal was Pollo Fundido which is a chicken burrito deep fried with a homemade jalapeño and sour cream cheese sauce. Wow was it good. The chicken had a really good flavor and large portions.  Retried beans have to be made with lard because they are fabulous.   Second meal was Cheese enchiladas meal. The green sauce stood out more than the red sauce even though both were great. Beans and rice was had great flavor and compliment he combo.   Over all great food and will come back over and over. Try for yourself. Won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Expecting mediocre  gringo food, imagine our surprise when the food that came was very good. Enjoyed the black beans for a change and the fish tacos were very good.  My margaritas, (raspberry) came with plenty of tequila in them. The ambience was lovely. We sat outside next to a pond with ducks. As the sun encroached upon us, (It was in the 90's) the manager could be seen raising the big umbrellas. Between the shade and the pond it was cool enough to enjoy the food. The wait staff and bus staff and manager were very amiable. The prices seemed reasonable, with my Delicious drinks at 8.50$ and my entrée at 14.00 or there about. My companion, who's standards are very high especially with Mexican food, thought his  beef taco's were superb! His mother was from Mexico and he said they were like what she served.   I would say if you find yourself in CAREFREE, find your way to the EL ENCANTO!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is unique! Pretty pond with ducks and turtles. The salsa is the best I have ever had. A trio of 3 unique homemade kinds; mild, hot and tomitilo. The chips are thin and crispy. We got the sampler plate for 17 and was enough for 3. The kids meals are $5 including a drink."}
{"text":"I've been coming to El Encanto for 20 years. It's a beautiful place with pretty good food. I've always expected to wait, but on my first time back in years with family from out of town we waited 90 minutes to sit while others have come and gone.   We tried calling in to make reservations but were told they weren't taking reservations. Upon arriving and putting our name down we were asked why we hadn't called in a reservation. After explaining the situation we were told it would be 30 minutes. Not a bad wait but 90 is uncalled for.   It's sad to see service suffer so badly but I have to say this will be my last trip here. Not worth the drive, not worth waiting this long."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, I love the atmosphere especially sitting outside where you are up close and personal to the wildlife. The food is delicious, although it doesn't seem super authentic it is a great place to grab a bite with the family. Love this place and will continue to go!"}
{"text":"Hmmm.... I gotta say I had high hopes and this wasn't good... I have complaints on the drinks... sub par... really sub par... let's not even mention the salsa, yikes tasted like cold spaghetti sauce. Not authenticity.... sorry just being honest."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place!! That's what first attracted us.   The food and service are good too.  I had the carnitas & a cheese enchilada and we got guacamole for the table. All of it was delicious! The carnitas were Lea for carnitas and bursting with flavor. My 1yr old son loved the guac, so did the rest of the table. :) The 3 salsas (verde w avo medium, traditional tomato mild, chipotle spicy) & chips they bring to the table to start are a very nice touch. Most Mexican restaurants only bring 1 salsa. All 3 of them were very flavorful.   The service was also great...starting with a busboy who explained the differences between the 3 salsas and continuing with our attentive server.   Great spot and would love to come back."}
{"text":"Was there for the first time today, and the last time I will be there. The food was not very good and the meal was overpriced for what we got. I had the fajitas and my wife had the quesadilla with vegetables. Tasteless and just not very good at all."}
{"text":"Sometimes there can be a wait, but the food is usually tasty. Chips and salsa with three yummy salsas to choose from are a highlight. Service is usually good- every once in awhile it is slow though. Prickly pear margaritas are a must if you like sweet drinks. Duck pond great for kids ( and me if you're an animal person!)."}
{"text":"This place was a super fun stop for lunch while we were exploring Cave Creek!  My girlfriends that live in Buckeye had been here before, and wanted to take me and our other girlfriend while we were out visiting, and I'm soo happy they did!  What a cool, unique little spot!  The perfect place for lunch and margaritas on a hot Arizona afternoon!    This is a huge restaurant, and when you walk in they have a nice little area with palm trees and a walkway that leads you to the main restaurant and their duck/turtle pond!  Its inside this little courtyard, and the seating is all around this neat pond area.  There were lots of mallards around, and also at least two different species of turtles sunning on rocks and swimming in the water!  Also they had a little station where you could buy feed for the animals, just put in a quarter and you get pellets to feed them!  When we did this, we saw there were also huge koi fish living in the water as well!  Very beautiful and large fish, really cool to see!    Anyway, about the restaurant...we asked to sit at a table by the water, so we waited a bit, but decided to go to the bar and get margaritas...they were REALLY good!  My margarita was definitely top notch, and it was perfect to chill in this nice little room by the bar while we waited for our table.  Once our table was ready, we got chips and salsa, which were also very good...I really liked their salsa especially, it tasted like it might have been homemade?  I ordered their Plato Burro, fried, with chicken, and it was good.  Came with rice and beans, and did have a lot of chicken in it which was nice.  Typical Mexican food, but good!  Our server was also very sweet and friendly, and was quick with drinks and food as well!   El Encanto definitely excels in atmosphere and the feel of the place is very special...my girlfriends and I had a wonderful time, with good food and drinks, and would definitely go back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and the wait was 45 minutes for a table.  We went to the bar to wait and a nice couple was just finishing and gave us there table upon leaving - score!   El Encanto's dirty little secret is their frozen margaritas.  Nick was our waiter and the bartender, said the machine was malfunctioning but would do his best to get us our drinks.  Well, drinks magically appeared and they were delicious as usual.  Dinner was exceptional, I had the Fajitas and my boyfriend had the Carne Asada Relleno. Wow, both dishes, the steak was cooked to perfection and so tender, you barely had to chew and cutting it was like butter. I want to give a shout out to Nick - even though he was busy both behind the bar and waiting on tables, he was very attentive each and every time he walked by the table, he asked if we needed anything and made sure that we were ok. It was a very nice experience overall."}
{"text":"Even though true Mexican dishes are terrific, sadly so many Mexican restaurants serve gloppy, over-sauced dishes that this style has been termed \"typical Mexican\".  Well this restaurant would fit the \"typical\" bill. The fish tacos were fair at best, with none of that really fresh fish taste you get at some places, and the \"Camarones Autnentico\" were small to medium shrimp swimming in a not so flavorful sauce. Other dishes were all Mexican mediocre chain quality.  The Sopapillas for dessert were neither fluffy nor tender.  Service was very good, atmosphere nice with a small pond in the middle, and their salsa and chips excellent. It may be a good stop for a few beers and chips, but other than that not worth a visit."}
{"text":"Delightful atmosphere! We came at 1pm on a Sunday and had a 30 minute wait. We were able to get a pitcher of margaritas at the bar and some chips. The margaritas were good - well balanced enough in that they didn't taste like liquor but you could feel them. The chips are thin, crunchy and fresh. We were seated at a table by the pond and could watch the turtles, ducks, and koi. It was cool but there were plenty of heaters. We had the tamales. They are actually the best I've had in a restaurant (my sister in law makes the best ever so I'm biased). They were moist - the masa was very flavorful and good texture. The service was good in the dining and bar. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The salsa was awful.  Three different types, none were at all spicy and one tasted like marinara sauce.  The cheese enchiladas were extremely bland.  The waiter also told us that the kitchen wasn't willing to make any substitutions on the tamale/taco/enchilada entree.  The prices were average, but a bit high considering the mediocrity of the food. The one plus is that the building is beautiful."}
{"text":"Good service, pleasant atmosphere, and a good menu. It is typical Mexican/US fare, but that is what you expect."}
{"text":"Stop in for breakfast , the place is beautiful . But skip this place for breakfast. Waiter told us they had no fresh eggs and refused to make a Bloody Mary with Clamato even they the had all the ingredients . However pushed the pre-made Bloody Mary cocktail."}
{"text":"This Mexican Food restaurant has this cool pond with ducks and turtles. The food is da bomb! The servers are excellent. Mikey T. the \"chip\" guy and Robert our server treated us great.  The margaritas are super delicious. Love the ambience. Can't go wrong having dinner here. Come on down and share a pitcher of fab margaritas."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new restaurant.   We drove to Cave Creek for some really good Mexican food.  Margaritas were delicious too.   I had a burrito with shredded beef rice and beans.  Great flavors throughout.   My wife had shrimp tacos and said they were outstanding!   My other traveling companion said, that those are the best tacos she has ever had, which is a big deal because she is doesn't get too excited about food very often.    I was drinking Don Julio 1942 and asked for another one.  Why did my waitress feel she had to remind me of the cost!!   I know what the hell I drink!!  that was the only negative thing that occurred.  The ducks  and turtles  on the pond made the experience worth the snide remark!!"}
{"text":"The chicken fundido is excellent.  The margeuritas are delicious.  I'm not sure that I like the duck & turtle pond...it seems a little gross.  There are lots of birds on the patio so we always eat inside ."}
{"text":"Good times, good friends, sweet margaritas.  A long drive through the desert for mexican food, but worth it."}
{"text":"What an enjoyable experience. Love the ambiance and had a blast watching the turtles. Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. The salsa trio was fresh and vibrant. I had a shredded beef taco that was juicy and flavorful and the BEST cheese enchilada I've ever had (I've had a lot). Soooooooooooo good! I usually don't care about refried beans but I cleaned my plate! They were so smooth. My husband's food was good enough that I didn't even get a taste. This place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Went here with Tori on Sunday and we had a really good time. The restauraunt surrounds a duck pond and we are both big duck fans so we sat outside and the ambiance was great. This is the perfect spot for wedding or work parties. The patios are huge. The food was ok, we just split the chile verde and it was spicy and the pork was really tender. We also had sangria and although a bit sweet for my tastes it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"Great restaurant,  a must for all our visitors.   I love the prickly pear margaritas...beautiful outdoor seating and the service and food is always good"}
{"text":"Whether you are looking for great Mexican food or a retreat away from the Phoenix metro area this is an ecellent place to go.  The entrance with the decorated walkway and pond stocked with coy fish and ducks makes you feel like you are walking into a \"real\" mexican restaurant that is in Mexico.  On the inside make sure to get a table that overlooks the pond and enjoy the atmosphere as you enjoy the authenic food that they serve.  This place is a must see when visiting Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Really nice to sit outside with a pond, birds and turtles. this place has been around for awhile and if your going to Cave Creek, check it out.  Food is good. Great frozen margaritas. Chips with three types of sauce. They have lunch specials. Check it out."}
{"text":"Best local Mexican cuisine in North Valley! So delicious and happy hours on the patio beside the duck/turtle pond are the greatest! Love the chips & trio of salsas"}
{"text":"The last time I went here there were several empty tables and the hostess said we would be waiting 45 minutes... needless to say we didn't, and left to eat elsewhere. The few times before my boyfriend and I had food here it was close to decent, not quite there. The prices are too high for the quality. Service was always slow and uninspired. The menu seems bigger than what you can pick from. There are better \"Mexican\" restaurants in Cave Creek that don't overcharge because they think the place looks nice. The duck pond is what you would expect, I can go to a zoo and see the same thing and probably eat better food as well. No offense, but this place could use a new menu/better staff. I have a feeling locals like us that live here avoid this place, and most of the people dining in are out of town snow birds. Too bad they don't know any better. Parking is also a pain, it's a like a tiny horseshoe with the restaurant in the middle, and the entrance is at the front near the road."}
{"text":"I RARELY give five stars to a restaurant-but this place earned their stars with their service, drinks, food, and atmosphere! I had their famous (or if you're not careful, infamous!) frozen margarita. I don't typically enjoy frozen margs, but these are on a different level. The texture isn't typical-it's more slurpee than icee-smooth, light, and almost creamy! The flavor was a perfect balance between tequila and mix.  The chips and salsa were delicious. My entree was OUTSTANDING! I had the carne asada relleno. The meat was cooked a perfect medium rare, the seasoning was flavorful. We couldn't understanding why they only had 3.5 stars because our experience was way better than that.  Loved the soft guitar music and the duck pond inside the courtyard. During high season, GO EARLY or call for a reservation because the wait can get long. We sat at the bar and the service was friendly and attentive! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to dine at El Encanto for over ten years, it has changed very little.  The food has been consistently above average from the first visit.  Chips are crispy, but they could be warm, the salsa (three varieties) are good, tho I think the lime green one needs some explaining, (what's in it?, again I forgot to ask).  I don't think the menu has changed at all since our first visit.  My favorite is the Pollo Asado con Salsa Autentica ranchero style with black beans and rice.  The cheese quesadilla and sample platter was ample and delicious.  Our drinks were checked and refilled promptly, and the margaritas were excellent.  The pond is full of turtles, and fewer ducks than I remember from my last visit, (they aren't on the menu) and the ducks and turtles will keep you entertained while waiting on your food and during your meal. The one inconsistency is the level of attention from the servers.  Our last visit was fine, our waitress was prompt and friendly, but prior visits did lack the prompt service and drink refills you would expect from a good restaurant, resulting in our request for a visit with the manager.   Prices are reasonable especially for the neighborhood.  I wouldn't hesitate to take out of town guests for unique atmosphere, indoor or outdoor seating and good food.  They can be busy on weekends and holidays, I would recommend calling ahead for reservations."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my sister yesterday. Requested a table by the water. I had the seafood enchilada special and my sister had the fish tacos. We agreed both entrees were very good and the atmosphere was awesome. She loved the outdoor eating area and can't wait to go back. Our waiter Gabriel was wonderful. Bonus: the little booths set up next to the restaurant we browsed through on the way to the car. I really like this place! It makes me feel like I'm on vacation."}
{"text":"The food is consistently delicious. The service has always been friendly and professional. My concern this visit was cleanliness. The fan near us and the light fixture directly above our table need a good dusting. Makes me wonder what other Cleaning has been forgotten or blown off."}
{"text":"Went to El Encanto for Restaurant Week 2009.  Took an hour to drive there from my home in Avondale, but it was well worth the drive.    Driving into Cave Creek, was so fun.  Reminded me of Sedona or a cute, little western town.    Sat outside near the pond.  I highly recommend sitting outside.  Watching the ducks, especially the ones with the fro's on their heads, was so funny.    The food was really good, but the environment was the best part.  I recommend driving out to El Encanto, especially for date night or a big group dinner.    Be careful though, sometimes the ducks get too close and bite you!  My friend's butt was particularly delicious to them.  Ha, ha!"}
{"text":"I love going to El Encanto - probably far more because of the ambiance and the fact that it is a sort of landmark in my hometown of Cave Creek. The food is solid, but not fantastic. I love the avocado salsa they bring out with chips. The pollo fundido is always good, if not a little dry at times. My kids love feeding the ducks, though, and are happy to go to El Encanto. The service is usually good. I would be sad if there was ever no more El Encanto."}
{"text":"LOVED everything about this restaurant!!!  Excellent guacamole, meals were robust and flavorful. Absolutely adorable venue. Excellent wait staff. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Best for miles. Wicked cool indoor / outdoor atmosphere. Margaritas aren't my thing but the wife loves um. Haven't had anything I don't like but the burros are awesome, especially the chicken. Service is ok gets really really busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Loved our first El Encanto visit!!!  You almost don't know they are at the new aquarium...seems like they do t let them advertise much?!?  Our server, Jaime, was amazing!!!  Knew the menu well, very friendly, knowledgeable, kid-friendly...which can be hard to find and overall just added great vibes to our dining experience.  Highly recommend this place.  My husband got the shrimp fajitas and I got the steak and chicken fajitas... Both were fantastic and their cream cheese jalapeño sauce was amazing as well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We love it here - the ambience is excellent.  I always order the same old thing the Fundidos.  It is totally yummy - cream cheese and crispy outside with moist chicken inside.  I'm in a rut but I'm good with it :)"}
{"text":"I have visited a couple of times now, with various friends and everyone loves the place and the food.  Let's start with the place.... As my wife put it: \"It feels like we are in San Diego\" (somewhere she loves); the combination of the pond, turtles, ducks, geese, trees and birds convinces one that you are no longer in the middle of the desert, but have been transported to some oasis of green, water and cool..... A wonderful setting for a meal.  You can either sit outside around the pond and enjoy being surrounded by the trees and wildlife, or if you are a little less adventuresome, there are plenty of tables inside, some up against floor length glass at the edge of the pond, so it seems as though you are outside.  The food itself is fresh (the salad is always crisp & tasty), VERY well cooked and the service excellent. We have tried a wide selection of dishes between us and everyone has been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the dishes presented.  If you are unsure what to choose, I recommend going with the 'Daily Special', I have opted for this a couple of times and on both occasions it has been excellent.  It is also very reasonably priced - I thoroughly recommend El Encanto!"}
{"text":"Low quality food .. Rarely make it right... Enchiladas can be cold and chicken tacos taste like chicken is old... If you ask for any thing extra like extra onions on an enchilada they will charge you $2 .. Ridiculous !! It's already overpriced !!"}
{"text":"I am so stunned anyone thinks this place has even average food. It's awful! The salsa is boring.  The service crappy! It tasted like frozen TV dinners from the '70's.  No great Mexican or burger place in Cave Creek blows my mind!"}
{"text":"Love this place...Best Mexican in the valley IMO. Makes for a beautiful and relaxing lunch destination. 5 stars for days!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  I've wanted to try this place for a long time.  1 - Frozen margaritas were very good, even at $7 each. 2 - Chips and salsa were great. 3 - Service was very good. 4 - Atmosphere nice with view of pond and turtles. 4 - However, entree was awful.  My chicken (pollo fundido) was extremely salty. 5 - I won't be back. 6 - Do yourself a favor; stop for cocktails and move on."}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring out non-Arizona guests. If you have any kids in your group they can feed the ducks and turtles. Usually there is a wait, but the huge patio makes for a nice place to relax and have an adult beverage, especially when it's hot outside.  Food consists of your typical Mexican entrees all with rice and beans. It's a couple of bucks higher than your a chain Mexican restaurant, but worth it for the location and atmosphere.  Recently, I was there on at Saturday night and was told the wait was 1.5 hrs, but before we finished our first margarita (45min)we were seated at a nice window table."}
{"text":"I've been here only twice. Today would've brought the experience down to a 1 star, but the previous one being a 3 - I settled on a 2.   This place is huge and dripping with atmosphere. It's sprawling in fact and the patio wraps around a duck and swan pond... can be fun, but can also be annoying. Depends on how you feel about birds. Maybe it's romantic. Maybe it's disgusting. Personally, I find it to be a little bit of both.  The food is average. The salsa is very tasty, but not spicy enough. Today they were having a buffet style thing for the mad rush of mother's day. The place was empty though. There were a lot of wait staff - about one per table... on a buffet night even. With all these servers, we found it nearly impossible to get service.  We opted out of the buffet since it didn't seem cost effective (or appetizing, but we had driven so far we thought we should make the most of it), and sat at the bar forever waiting for one of the 5 servers to stop watching Castaway on TBS long enough to ask us what we wanted.    The margaritas were weak and not very cheap. The waiter was rude, but he brought us a refill during a commercial. I think it's simply too far to be worth it. If the food was above average and the service was good, this would be a fun time. The whole area is a very touristy spot. I'd suggest it as a place to take your parents when they come visit you."}
{"text":"I love the pollo fundido and the atmosphere is very relaxing!I enjoy sitting and being able to watch the ducks while I'm eating ntt food it is definitely a place to check out any time you come to Cave Creek"}
{"text":"This is a surprisingly wonderful place to host a small reception or gathering (40pple or less). Recently went to a wedding reception here and it was beautiful! The food was good as well. Great chimis and fajitas. The chips were a little on the stale side and the house marg wasnt the best (pay more to get a better marg) but overall nice place."}
{"text":"My family stopped here on a Friday afternoon during our vacation. It wasn't busy at all so our experience was a quiet one.  The atmosphere was beautiful inside and out!  If it hadn't been for the fact that it reached record high temps that day, we would've eaten outside. We were able to sit at a table right next to the pond and it was really fun to watch the ducks and turtles swim.  We were greeted and seated immediately, and our waiter was very attentive. My hubby and I both had the Pollo Fundido and is was soooo good!  The quality of the chicken was excellent! It was also a fun little town to walk around after lunch. Next time we are in AZ we will be back!"}
{"text":"I am normally a very positive person, and am hardly critical of dining establishments, food and service because I KNOW how difficult this industry can be....but last night's experience in this restaurant left such a bad taste in my mouth, that I really feel the need to share our experience with you. My husband and I are from Calgary, and we heard amazing reviews from Calgarians about this restaurant, so on our last night in Phoenix, we made the drive to Scottsdale for dinner. My husband made the reservation for 7 pm, and the person on the other end gave us driving instructions to get to the restaurant. We arrived at exactly our reso time, and were seated immediately. After we placed our drink and food order, a gentlemen (very young and quite immature) decided to stop at our table and lecture us about booking a reservation for 7 pm. He told us that their kitchen closes at 6 pm, so we \"should know better for next time to not book so late in the evening.\" We were told \"it's okay for THIS time, but please don't let it happen again.\" We felt like the biggest inconveniences to these people. Our dinner arrived, and my husband is a quick eater, whereas I am not.  I had at least 3/4 of my meal left on my plate, when the young gentlemen returned to our table and took my husband's plate away and put the bill on the table. I have never in my life been treated like this in a dining establishment. It was so very, very rude. I told our server to pack up my meal because \"clearly, we were inconveniencing them when they wanted to close up so badly.\" Of course, he responded with \"Oh no, please stay. You are no trouble at all!\" But I told him again to pack up my food and we would leave. When we got up to leave, these two young men were hanging out at a table, playing away on their phones. The young, immature gentlemen stood up and started to say \"Thank you. Thank you for coming in. Have a good --- \" but by that time, I expressed with my middle finger exactly what he could do with the rest of his sentence. He got my point, and stopped talking. I have worked in this industry, so I am not a pretentious snob who knows nothing about late-arriving guests when a kitchen is trying to close. If booking a 7 pm reservation was such an issue for these two boys, then they should have simply told us over the phone, and we would have happily booked elsewhere. As for the food, I have had better. It was not terribly awful, but definitely dry and lacked flavour. I ordered a pork carnitas with a cilantro sauce (no cilantro sauce on plate, which was disappointing). Husband can't even recall what he even ate...so that says how unremarkable the food is.  Overall, horrible service. Will not bother with this place again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is magnifico! The service is extraordinary, the wait staff is cheerful and approaches the tables regularly in a timely manner.  The prickly pear margarita is to die for! Just awesome. Do try the carne Asada relleno , Superb! Try to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"What a wonderfully delicious place! Great atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, and delicious food! It was such a great meal all around! WONDERFUL MARGS! My husband is picky with Mexican food and they even have burgers on the menu that were yummy! We also came on our honeymoon and they gave us a fried ice cream in celebration! So fun! HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican place in Cave Creek. Authentic atmosphere. Food is reasonably priced. The hostess on the other hand is not so nice! Don't ask for outside seating! She'll put you in your place for you being dare enough to ask! I was made to feel like I should be grateful for even getting a seat inside!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The restaurant itself is so fun to sit in, and the food is delicious! Go try it out!"}
{"text":"We have no plan to visit this place once again. Really bad attitude.  Have of the place was empty but they still want you to wait for half an hour or more. You guys lost my continue business."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  The strawberry blended house margaritas is definitely worth trying.   The salsas were okay... The guacamole was really good.   We always try to stop here for at least one drink to watch the turtles and ducks."}
{"text":"This has GOT to be THE BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT on the planet. Our waiter Sage was outstanding. Stuffed jalapenos were to die for not to mention their homemade Margaritas!!!  A must stop in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"El Encanto serves authentic Mexican food in dreamy atmosphere.  Great for a date night or special occasion w my kids.  They serve a mole that I compare all other moles to.  The margaritas are also top notch.  My kids like the duck, koi, and turtle filled pond.  I understand on Sat mornings they have a mariachi band.  Customer service has always been great here as well.  Highly recommended for a taste of Mexico."}
{"text":"The burrito shell is extra crispy today and the beans are crisp from being under heat lamp to long or something normally food not like this"}
{"text":"Although we had to wait over a half-hour to be seated, (which we expected because it was a Friday) the service was fast, efficient, and excellent! I enjoyed the Pollo Fundido with the award winning house Margarita!  We sat outside near the heaters and it was absolutely beautiful!!  Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. It is quaint and has a large outdoor patio as well as a large indoor space. We opted for the bar. Had a beer and a margarita (very nice). The complementary chips, fresh and warm, came with a salsa trio (mild tomato, medium avocado tomatillo and hot tomato) was very flavorful! The menu offerings are many and I chose the carne asada relleño, which was the best meal! A roasted pepper filled with cheesy goodness, topped with mashed potatoes and steak cooked to perfection.  My husband chose the carnitas burrito without any of the sauce on top, which he later regretted as the tortilla was dry. The atmosphere was hopping, the staff is very attentive and friendly. A must in downtown Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"It was a rainy Sunday afternoon at 2:30pm and this place was packed.  I'm not sure why everyone was thinking Mexican and running late for lunch, but I was not alone.  I noticed they were quick to bring out propane heaters to the outside diners.  It is outside yet covered from the rain.    It was a quick 20 minute wait.  It probably would have been a shorter wait, yet a few outside tables were wet from the rain.  They have a beautiful inside seating area with big windows at each table.  Looks like you might drop right off into the pond.  Our waitress was quick to take our drink orders, another server was quick with chips and salsa.  They serve 1 green and 2 red salsas with the chips.  Some reviews I read complained about the charge for a second order of chips.  It is 99 cents.  No big deal.  It was so beautiful, I would be tempted to spend a lazy weekend afternoon with a few cervezas and order of chips.  The 99 cents is totally understandable.  We ordered shredded beef tacos, rolled tacos, an order  of guacamole, a quesadilla, and a bowl of soup.  Everything was wonderful.  Yes I've had better salsas, yet this was perfect for my day.  It was fresh and complimented the food.   I'll be back.  P.s.  We had a great view of the pond with ducks and turtles swimming by.  Bring quarters.  They have duck food in gumball machines.  No tacos for the ducks.  :)"}
{"text":"Great place to have a romantic Mexican dinner. The seating by the pond/water is tranquil and something that you don't find anywhere else. The food is good, better than average. They are very generous with the chips and salsa here. Which is something that you don't find at a lot of places. I am one that likes to dip a chip in my meal and I don't like being told that \"I am going to have to charge you for more chips\". I love stopping here when I am in the neighborhood, great watering hole after a long ride on the bike."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since the mid 90's. I am now in my 30's and still frequent on ocassion.  The last time we were here it was great. We came for lunch and were able to sit outside near the pond. The menu was as I remembered. Tonight was different. Sunday night about Tom and the wait was 45 minutes for first available. We found a seat at the bar and an hour later my husband went to check how much longer and he was told \"hopefully\" another twenty-five minutes. Just as we were about to order our buzzer went off. We were seated inside, in the back, against the wall and across from three empty tables next to the windows near the pond. It happened to be my birthday dinner and my husband asked to be moved to the tables near the window. The hostess responded with \"you're more than welcome but you would need to go back up front and wait in line and I would need to seat this table immediately\".....which is understandable because of the wait. But the way she said it was rude. As for the menu; it was different. I ordered my \"usual\": cheese enchiladas. It came with two sauces...not the standard red. When my husband ordered the carne asada Chile rellano he was asked \"how he wanted it cooked\". That's odd. I've never been asked how I wanted my carne asada cooked. \"Medium rare?\". The dish arrived with three pieces of \"steak\" and a poblano stuffed with mashed potatoes!!!!! I've never encountered this type of Mexican cuisine anywhere. And I thought I was quite knowledgeable concerning the cuisines of Mexico. It just wasn't what I expected or wanted for my birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Can't judge the food at this location. Not very busy when we showed up, they promptly sat us and we received chip and salsa within 5 minutes. Then nothing... waited another 15 minutes for a waiter to do just drink orders but to no avail. We left."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restuarant since 5th grade. In case you are wondering this is way way over ten years now. I've watched it grow and change. The Mexican food is great, not the gourmet Santa Fe style, but true AZ style...a little greasy, a little sloppy, but oh so good.  Aside from the food you can't bea the atmospher. If possible sit outside by the duck pond. It's a real treat. If you have little ones bring some change and feed the ducks.  WARNING: Watch out if you sit at a table by an overgrown palm tree, my grandmother got pooped on by an owl once...no joke!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  The duck pond is a great feature."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Fresh and amazing guacamole..... I added my own salt to it. Chicken Tacos, Mahi MahiTacos, Salads, and just about everything has been great there. Great Margaritas also! Very scenic and Authentic fun at El Encanto. Love it here."}
{"text":"ALWAYS eat here when in Cave Creek and try to take out of state company here during their visit. Food is awesome, service is great and margaritas are amazing. Prices are fairly reasonable."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance! Great service! Carne Asad a tacos were delicious.   Lots of meat.  Our seats were overlooking the pond.  So relaxing! Will return."}
{"text":"I wish I would have taken a photo of my food before I sent it back to the kitchen. I ordered a $10 salad (I don't mind spending that much, but it should be a good salad). It was mostly iceberg lettuce that was starting to turn brown, and it was swimming (literally swimming) in black bean liquid. They must have just scooped black beans right on top of the salad without draining them first. Plus, the \"tomato\" that they put on it was one slice and it was partly white because it wasn't ripe yet (yuck). This salad was a joke.  My friend ordered l quesadilla. Now, I'm not sure how anyone can screw up a quesadilla, but they managed to. It is literally an open face tortilla with a bunch of greasy (fake looking) cheese on top. Where's the crispy tortilla?! Where are the toppings? The children at our table didn't even like it. Needless to say, I won't be heading back there again. I have one star because leaving none was not an option."}
{"text":"Good place, great atmosphere, with the turtle pond in the middle, very pleasant courtyard for eating. Ordered the lamb barbacoa, and it was tasty, particularly the sauce. Good, friendly service. Not mind-blowing amazing Mexican food, but solid, with good atmosphere. Good salsas."}
{"text":"Our first time eating here from so many people telling us how great the food was, we were not disappointed. It was amazing!!! One of the best chicken quesadillas ever! The atmosphere is awesome and the staff was friendly! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Easter Brunch - we were seated outside right away. Great patio yet interesting choice to have a pond and give up so much real estate.  Patio is great for pictures, kids and does provide some wildlife entertainment. Make your own margaritas with plenty of tequila options is a terrific bonus. The food was typical Mexican food - chips and salsa so-so. Three stars because I was looking for some spice and nothing jumped out."}
{"text":"Visitied on Easter after golfing on a semi-hot day. Excellent chips and salsa/hot sauce to try before dinner. Had the appetizer for two, pollo fundido, a red and green tamale and 2 taquitos. Very good and filling for the $$ spent, would recommend highly! Cadillac margaritas hit the spot on a hot day."}
{"text":"was a little hesitant with the low ratings i saw but i liked it.  the decor was great!  surprised with the pond and geese with the authentic mexican blankets and tile.  i ordered the meatball soup and liked them both.  the price was reasonable.  would go back."}
{"text":"excellent food and great atmosphere- parking can be an issue but once the 110 weather gets here it will be adequate."}
{"text":"OMG, please...this is not good Mexican food folks. Not even close...  This is the heat lamped, warmed over, greasy spoon Mexican food that you could find in any big city in America.  The patio and atmosphere by the pond with the birds is simply lovely, so this is a great place to come for some beers and Margaritas. But the food here does not taste fresh, is not generally tasty.  The quality standard for the people who live up here in Cave Creek is obviously very very low, but El Encanto is a really a place to bring your Aunt Sadie when she comes to town for a charming drink or two.  If you want EXCEPTIONAL food (with a boring atmosphere)  go down the street to \"Los Mesquites Taqueria.\" This is real Mexican food, melt in your mouth homemade corn tortillas, homemade chips, from scratch salsas, and very good Carne Asada. You won't get to watch the little duckees float by, but at least the food is superb and authentic.  El Encanto Dos is just a smidge better than Uno, but that isn't saying much.   El Encanto is easily one of the most overrated pseudo Mexican restaurants in Phoenix...Blech. I have had better Mexican at Jack In The Box."}
{"text":"With a desire to get out of the 100+ degree heat, we headed up to Cave creek for a bit cooler weather, some chicken tacos and a couple brews.  El Encanto has a neat little pond in the middle of the restaurant, and pretty darn good food.  The service was great, draft beer was ice cold.  I wouldn't necessarily make the drive solely to eat here, but when in the area it is a very solid dining optoin."}
{"text":"Your service has sucked lately! You have a manager that doesn't know the menu! They tell me that a order for pickup is 30  minutes. I show up in ten minutes and it's setting getting cold. Your workers are rude. I've been coming to the cave Creek since forever! Been to the one carefree hwy for years. I have a business in fountain hills for 15 year's and I have to say I will not recommend this reasturant to anyone! You need to get it together or not whatever you can afford"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found ourselves at this restaurant by chance. The atmosphere was lively and a very good guitarist played among the tables. The building is older, but interesting. I liked the layout, with the pond in middle and kids feeding the ducks. Service was friendly and average.  Based on recommendations found here, I ordered the pollo fundido and was not disappointed. It was very good.  After all of this, are you wondering why the two-star review? It comes down to one thing. SALSA. It's not hard to make a simple, pleasant salsa. One can be a self-declared talent-less cook and still manage to produce a palatable salsa. With my salsa-addicted boyfriend and our history of always polishing off the salsa and chips provided with the meal, we left our table with three salsas remaining.  One was a tomatillo salsa.  It was probably the best of the three,...after adding a substantial amount of salt to it. (We were told the secret ingredient of this was iceberg lettuce.)  The second salsa had a weird underlying flavor to it, almost like paprika. It was just funky. (The secret ingredient of this concoction was dried pepper, which probably explains the smokey flavor it had.)  The third salsa was more like a mushy tomato sauce. It would be best paired with mozzarella sticks.  (This salsa, the house salsa, was made with canned tomatoes and garlic. That's it. Seriously?)   For a Mexican restaurant that puts out good food, salsa of this poor quality is inexcusable and a little shocking."}
{"text":"Recently had lunch here and had the worst tostada of my entire life. We had grandkids with us and they were enchanted with the pond so the visit was enjoyable but don't come here for the food. It has slipped dramatically in the last 10 years."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from multiple people but it's practically the other side of the world from us (over 40 miles), so it took awhile but we finally made the drive. It was very dark on the outside and we weren't exactly sure how to get to the main entrance at first, but we walked through the outdoor patio with heaters and found the hostess desk. Only waited a minute or so before we were seated. The place is a lot bigger than I realized. After adjusting the crooked table and sliding into the booth, I felt the back of my pants were damp. Obviously they had just wiped down the seat with a wet rag and didn't dry it off. Gross! What I also didn't like about where we were seated is that it was right under the air handler which was very noisy and then my allergies started acting up during dinner. There were 3 types of salsa: mild, medium, and hot (not hot). I liked the mild & \"hot\" together. The medium salsa was green and tasted like lawn clippings. I appreciated that our server pointed out a few items on the menu since I was looking for regular chicken enchiladas. I got the Enchiladas de Queso with chicken (1 red, 1 green) and no onion. When our food came out, I found that the enchilada sauce was just room temperature, not hot. The rice had peas and carrots which I have never seen in Mexican rice before. The meal tasted pretty good but it wasn't cheap and I really don't think I can justify driving that far to eat here again."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful meal at El Encanto the service and food was amazing. If your looking for a great quality meal at a good price it's right down your alley. The cheese dip was great and the Jalepeno rennos were amazing as was the Plato de carnitas. Come and have a great meal!"}
{"text":"We were there in the winter (off season) a couple times and we had no problem with service. Loved it. I loved the thick, yummy baked cheese dip- too bad I can't remember what it's called. And the Pollo Fundido- yum! Can't beat the atmosphere; chill, beautiful, and... constant duck entertainment on the pond. My cousin brings her 3 year old to \"the duck restaraunt\" every time she visits. Love this place."}
{"text":"I can't believe on a Saturday with 20 empty tables you can't have a margarita with your fam just a stop in not welcome ... just full dining unless you want to sit in the dark bar no view or if your alone or with 1 other maybe the outside bar but not more than a few seats there :(  off to horny toad"}
{"text":"Super delicious! I love El Encanto! I went with a friend on a busier night but we were able to quickly get a spot at the bar. Their margaritas are amazing, food was exceptional, and staff very friendly and attentive. This place has something for everyone. I got a shrimp dish with a cream sauce that was so good there was nothing left. Overall great place that accommodates everyone. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite stops in Cave Creek. Consistent excellent service, great portions and wonderful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and was very impressed.  First the food: had the green chili beef burrito and was very impressed.  Next time looking forward to trying the chili relleno.  Next the service: very attentive staff, not only our waitress but the entire service team checked in on us throughout our meal.  Very courteous.  Finally, the atmosphere: this is a very unique setting with indoor seating, patio seating, and a pond the restaurant is built around where the kids can feed the ducks and swans.  Very well laid out and thoroughly enjoyable.  Can't wait to get back for more!"}
{"text":"Maybe Texas Tex-mex spoiled me, but overall I am not impressed with Zona mexican food.  El Encanto isn't too bad though.  I've always left full and fairly satisfied with the flavors - and the chips and salsa.  Good chips and salsa get me every time!  The ambiance is unique but eating on the outdoor patio has it's downside.  Like birds?  I mean birds flying close to you, eating the food at the recently vacated table next to yours?  Not only were the ducks under the tables and being shooed away by the wait staff, but flocks of none too timid sparrows were cleaning the tables before the busboys got there.  Thoughts of bird droppings and disease did cross my mind.  My whole family was mildly freaked out by it.  Hopefully this was not a typical experience - it did occur only once in our several visits so I don't want to emphasize it too much.  Kids love the place.  Feeding the ducks, watching the turtles and fish, etc.  Great photo ops with the munchkins.  But, the next time I go, I will wait for a booth inside with a glass wall onto the pond.  And the good news is the bar looks dark and cozy.  So that waiting needn't be a drag.   Solid value based on the food and the setting.  I've been there multiple times and will go again!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I moved from Austin, TX last year. As such... mexican or tex-mex restaurants are not something I am used to. Hole in the walls run by moms and pops? Yes. PLEASE. Somehow those are just vastly BETTER.  That said, El Encanto is turning out some decent food. Not great. Not bad. Just decent. The mole is probably some of the best I have tasted (what IS that flavor to it that I have never had in mole before?). The enchiladas aren't spectacular but then again... they're enchiladas. I like 'em. Pollo Fundido? I guess I'm in the minority with that one as I barely touched it. The chicken wasn't the least bit tender and chowing down on poultry a few feet away from some ducks, swans and random birds wasn't exactly a rocking experience.  Having said that, the pond and its denizens does provide for some nice atmosphere. Go at night around dinner. In the summer it cools off enough and in the winter the patio is heated. Just make sure to guard the complimentary salsa and chips off hours or you will have some competition for them.  In my visits, service has always been A+ though.  My main gripe... the margaritas. People think these are good!? For the price I'm paying I at least expect to taste SOMETHING. I've ordered them enough times now to know they're consistently weak and mostly ice. Hell to the no. Never again.  All in all El Encanto is a good enough place to go when in Cave Creek and in need of some americanized Mexican food."}
{"text":"Usually a favorite place of ours, but not today. We went for breakfast about 10 am and we were the only ones in the place. Business ramps up about 11 am. The manager at the front desk was on the phone, so we had to wait for him to finish his conversation to be seated and he made sure we knew they were only serving breakfast.  My husband was looking forward to the hue so rancheros as he says they are the best he's had anywhere. I can't eat egg yolks (digestive issue) and every dish had eggs. I asked if egg whites could be substituted in anything and our waiter curtly said, \"No\" and perhaps we wanted to go across street to another restaurant where they offered more \"American\" breakfasts. We said that wasn't the point and could I just get some of their soup or just roasted veggies and tortilla and our waiter, Gabe, said again curtly, no we can't do that. You can only order how it is on the menu and soup can't be ordered till 11:00. What?! Never did the manager, who was mopping floor around us ever step in or ask why we were leaving or even make an attempt at customer service. Again, we were the ONLY people in the place. It will be a long time before we ever go back and it WONT BE FOR BREAKFAST."}
{"text":"We live the Carefree location and were so excited when we saw them so close to the house. The food and salsa is exactly the same - great!  I think the location is limiting their traffic as we were there on a Thursday night around 6pm and there was only one other table dining. But the Aquarium was also dead, so I assume until the location really gets more awareness and overall traffic, it will be that way. I just hope they can make it in this spot because we are big fans.  They don't have what we consider the \"best\" margaritas but they get the job done."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 20 years and is by far one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  I live in chandler and drive nearly an hour just to eat here and enjoy the scenery.  The chips and salsa are absolutely amazing and so is the food. Make sure you call ahead to try and reserve a table by the pond (inside by the Windows during the summer months)."}
{"text":"For some reason EC Uno falls far short of EC Dos in terms of food quality. Dos must have a superior kitchen staff?  Anyway, food was dry and far less flavorful than the meals we regularly get at EC Dos. Only been here once, so it could have been a bad night in the kitchen. Regardless, the food was disappointing enough to warrant never returning.  We'll stick with EC Dos, where the food is consistently great and has never disappointed us.  P.S. Pond is nice, but duck poop smell isn't..."}
{"text":"Place was raved about and I was completely let down.. the food was not good and cocktails were awful. My lovely waitress was awesome however but I will not spend another penny in that establishment.."}
{"text":"Great food and great service are the two things that I really look for in giving five stars and this place has both of those qualities. I hadn't realized that the Odysea aquarium had a plaza area with gift shops and restaurants, so I was excited to see the different food options in the area. However, everyone in our group was really feeling Mexican so we stopped in here. What a great decision! One person in our party has a gluten allergy, so we were really surprised to see that many of their dishes could be made gluten free!   I had the pollo fundido and the jalapeño cream cheese sauce was amazing! I wish I could have some of that on hand at home because it was so good. The service was also awesome as well - I think our server was Jarrett, who was super nice and attentive to our table. For an unplanned visit, I'm really impressed and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here last year when I was in AZ, I thought it was God's gift to Mexican food... I was a bit tipsy last year when I went there... I went again last week, it was \"ehhhh\". Don't get me wrong, still good, but not as wonderful as I remembered... not even close.   We had to wait an hour for a table, the waiter made us wait about 15 minutes (not kidding) for water and chips/salsa... Seriously, 15 minutes? You dumbass!   The desserts were super good though, that was the upside..."}
{"text":"I met my friend here, we all drove from various locations and this place was worth the drive. Tequila was decent. Food was pretty good. Air conditioning was excellent and the view was just gorgeous. Felt like we were on vacation. The service was excellent!   We each even got separate checks without a complaint from the server. Restaurant is very interesting and has a very nice feel to it. I don't know if I would consider the food amazing but it was good enough. Did I mention the beautiful view?  Glass was so clean I felt like we were outside."}
{"text":"We are from the Bay Area and admitted taco/mexi snobs. This place blew our minds. The atmosphere in that lovely courtyard, the robust tequila menu, great service, amazing food. The menu had us trying stuff we don't usually order with no regrets!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service!  Just a warning it gets crowded on weekends but they really have a good staff to handle the volume of people!!"}
{"text":"The best part about dining at El Encanto is arriving early so you can have the patio to yourself, so to speak. I joined a friend of mine for lunch there today at 11:30 am and we were the only ones there. Jaime, our waitress was very sweet and took great care of us. Wait for our food and drinks were minimal and the entrees were delicious. I had the lunch size Pollo Fundido which is a melt in your mouth affair it is so delicious and instead of the side of rice I ordered some grilled vegetables which were perfect.   My friend had the beef fajitas and she loved it. The drinks in my opinion are bit pricey...yes $ 8.50 for a frozen raspberry margarita isn't exactly cheap and they are not generous with the serving of the glass size either...so before tip our bill was $ 47.99 - that's a lot of money to spend on two people for lunch. I'm not bitching cause the food was really delicious and the service was quite wonderful."}
{"text":"The food was subpar. The portions were extremely small for the price. We were very disappointed with the overall quality of the \"Mexican food\" I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Gorgeous setting outside with the pond and high ceilings. Reminds me of La Fonda Hotel down in baja. Unfortunately, after being served one margarita each and both of us finishing them over the Pollo Fundidio while we waited for our friends to join us, we ordered two shots of tequila. 20 minutes later, after our friends had arrived, ordered, and received their drinks we still had no sweet agave in sight.   We proceed to inquire about our shots, and received a half-mumbled and incoherent excuse about not having more than one drink at a time on the table. He clearly had failed to notice that according to the law [ARS 4-244.23] it strictly prohibits SELLING more than 40oz of beer, one liter of wine, or 4 oz of hard liquor to one person at one time. Allowing someone to order a second beverage when they know that by the time it gets to the table the first will be consumed is standard practice, and we weren't ordering doubles, bothering any other customers, or behaving in any other offensive manner. Not to mention both of our glasses sat empty on the table for at least 15 minutes BEFORE he came back with his excuse.  The manager then came to \"apologize\" but didn't offer to cover an appetizer or a round of drinks, which is the general practice in the industry when an employee makes a mistake or insults a customer in some way. As a veteran of the restaurant biz myself I was embarrassed  both for the waitstaff and the management. It's a shame because it's such a beautiful place but I will definitely not return to spend $60 on greasy cheese, watered-down margaritas, and a rude staff."}
{"text":"we went to el encanto at the cave creek location for mothers day this year and last :) this year i pigged out (lst year surgery) food was very good and ranged from omlettes made for you as you ordered them, mahi-mahi, made to order waffles-yum!!   cheese enchilada's (just as good as their carefree location) fresh squeezed orange & apple juice/cider. service was really good as waitress mentioned that the orange juice that i ordered to her previously, you can get where the food was and i said i saw that-she didn't hesitate to ask me if she could still get me a glass and i replied yes please :) i was impressed with that as my food was hot and i didn't want to go back up to the line and wait. that's service for you!! the atmosphere also at this certain location has a huge pond with ducks, turtles and birds and is a delight to be there in the morning and have a nice buffett brunch with watching the scenery along with it. there's nice local shops across the street to visit in addition afterwards. support our local restaurants and shops!! sandy :)"}
{"text":"Best Fajitas and fajita salad bowls we've had since we moved to Arizona. Both chicken and steak were perfectly cooked . Great Atmosphere and the place is huge! Service for a weekend evening was fast & friendly. Totally recommend it and will be eating there again."}
{"text":"We own a vacation home in Northern Scottsdale and decided to take a drive through Carefree and Cavecreek. Loving Mexican food we decided to try out El Encanto after reading the reviews here on yelp. I am someone that always goes to wash my hands after we place our order and in doing so I had to pass the kitchen. Big mistake and I really wish I didn't see what I saw. It was a mess!! The odor coming out of there was horrible and everything was so dirty. To even think my food that I'm going to put into my body was coming from that kitchen made me nauseous. So word of advice be seated and don't move. I'm giving it three stars because we did survive but we will not be back"}
{"text":"We have gone here a dozen times or so and the food is the best Mexican food we have had...staff is friendly....the only I can say is not as put together/clean as I would like to see...but a very cool place."}
{"text":"Normal 20-30 min wait for a Saturday and the kitchen was another 30 mins out. We finally got sat right next to the lake which was really nice to sit by. The waitress wasn't too friendly, seemed like she would rather be anywhere else but work. She offered what the special was for the night which sounded good, so we had two orders. Everything came out quicker than 30 mins but when we got the check we were shocked. I really wished she would have informed us the special was an $18 plate!!!! Times two! It was delicious but we were looking forward to paying that much money on a meal!"}
{"text":"Food is good and service was fine, but would've like a heads up when adding chicken to my child's small meal ended up costing as much as the meal.  Waitress claims she had no control over it but it would've been nice to have known!"}
{"text":"Took our daughter and future son in law last Thursday night when they came to visit for a long weekend.  Food, beverages, wait staff were all amazing.  When we visit, we always start our vacation at El Canto.  Have never had a bad waiter or waitress ever.  Love the pond.  Highly recommend it.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great experience for the whole family. Pollo Fundido was excellent. Also, the trio sala and chips were a great appetizer."}
{"text":"It is a wonderful destination around Phoenix to  enjoy! It offers a  beautiful setting and great food.  It has a pond with ducks and fish, a small.bridge.... Large open rooms,for special events and  indoor and outdoor seatings at the restaurant. On weekends they have a guitarist who plays mellow music... Charming!!!"}
{"text":"I met some friends here. We had a delightful time and truly fabulous food. This is the first Mexican style restaurant that I have really enjoyed in AZ."}
{"text":"We have been to Cave Creek several times and we always drive by and think we should stop in there sometime. Today was the day. We had friends visiting from out of town and wanted to take a bike ride so we headed out to Cave Creek and stopped in for lunch. It was pretty busy and we did have a bit of a wait but we just hung out at the bar while we waited for a table. If there hadn't been such a large group of us I would have just stayed in the bar area. We ended up on the patio which was nice. My hubby and I shared the appetizer sampler platter which was plenty of food for us. I really liked the tamale verde and I think I would order that the next time we go. Everyone in our group liked their food. I would have given 5 stars but the service was super slow!!"}
{"text":"I'm still with the four stars...and that's GOOD! Consistent.  I would give them FIVE if: * either fill my margarita glass to the tippy top or charge a little less than $6.50 OR add some tequila to it! At $6.50 a marg, (rocks) I'd hope for a little feeling of \"ah, I've had a marg\" but I don't get it and I'm something of a lightweight - especially at 106 degrees on the patio. (This marg is $5.50 on happy hour - I'd like to see it $5.00 all day, every day!)  Well, I guess that's my only beef! The service has been consistently conscientious, the food and portions reasonable and the patio is charming. That Queso Guillermo floats my boat (sinks my waistline though!) - it's the best plate of cheesy heaven - done just right.   I did ask on my recent check-in about the fact that they won't serve you a small pitcher of margs unless two people are sitting down. (Small pitcher = 3 drinks) They will however, serve you three margaritas consecutively. Per my server, it's some AZ law regarding how much alcohol can be in front of someone. (Think of the ball games - each person can only buy so many oz of beer etc.) And here, I always think of this as the \"wild west.\" I guess you can only get wild one drink at a time...and that the whole isn't greater than the sum of the tequila shots.    Does that make sense? I wish they'd have served me one pitcher instead of five drinks ;) Oh, the math!  Note: just kidding...can't afford 5 margs LOL"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, live guitarist, food great. We were there on a Friday night and had a 50 minute wait for a table. Suggest making a reservation, go early or on a weekday."}
{"text":"The food here is decent.  It is basically like any other Mexican restaraunt in Phoenix- like Ariba and what not.  Same menu, same items, etc .  Nothing special, but this place does have a duck pond which is a hit with the kids.  It's also HUGE.  Not sure if they ever fill the place, maybe for Cinco de Mayo?  I don't know."}
{"text":"I felt really uncomfortable when I walked in because the girls in the front desk were frustrated and had an attitude about other customers. The food and drinks were great."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!  We have been coming here for years for the delicious pollo fundido and beautiful pond but now I have to rave about management. When I came in to the restaurant I found a debit card on the ground. I turned it into the hostess hoping the owner will come back. The manager came by to thank me. Then to my surprise... he bought my lunch!  This place is the best!  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"One word! FUN!  Ok maybe a few more words. We drove from Surprise on recommendations from a friend. We will be using this destination to take friends. Will add more tomorrow ...... not enough time"}
{"text":"Tried this place when on a trip to Odysea. We were promptly seated and called for cheese and vegetable enchiladas. The tortilla chips served when we were first seated accompanied with 3 sauces was very good. The entrees were ok, the rice served seemed refried over and over since it had become a bit crisp. The main issue was that there were only 3 filled tables and over 6 staff members but they were all over at the bar or the enterance and we had to wait over 10minutes just for the check."}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite Mexican restaurant for my entire life. The cute little duck pond and cozy lighting make it perfect for date nights. My favorite dish, by far, is the pollo fundido, however, the dish is a lot smaller than it used to be for the same price. We will definitely be returning the next time we are in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"We had some family in town and we decided to bring everyone here. We had to wait a little while but it was a weekend night so it was expected. We grabbed some drinks in the bar and chips and salsa, we were happy campers.  Chips and salsa were both good. Nothing EXTRAORDINARY but the salsa was very good.  We sat outside by the big pond and it was nice out, even in the summer. I ordered the Pollo Fundido and it was very good as well. I'm not going to say if it was the best or not since everyone has different preferences, but it was very very good and worth ordering. I would say it is more on the sweeter side (must've been the cream cheese) than most fundidos.  Service was very good and attentive, kitchen speed was fine. Great food at a great place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hostess with dark short hair was really rude. On the phone was snappy on simple questions on seating.. other location was full. I'm a waitress so I definently respect people working in restaurants and was not rude in any way. We came in to ask for a table for 5, got a wait time (totally ok) and gave her my name. I gave the name \"Enrique\", (Spanish name-Spanish restaurant lol?),and she asked for an easier name with a dead expression. Are you serious. Enrique is not a hard name. If anything it was a tad racist. Fix that. Other than that pond looks nice. Food is delicious. Sorry el Encanto, love your restaurant since childhood but customer service should be such a priority... little things like this can ruin a whole experience"}
{"text":"My first dissapointing meal there,whats going on never seen it so empty,must have new chef."}
{"text":"Margaritas were good. Everything else disappointing. Mahi-mahi taco (chef selection) tasted fishy and steak fajitas were charred. Server seemed very dis-interested.  Atmosphere was nice though.  Must be doing something right though because it was very crowded on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Great food, fun environment and very friendly/helpful staff.  They have both outdoor & indoor seating, outdoors has plenty of heating lamps to keep you comfortable on a cool evening.  Prices are fantastic for the amount & quality of the food you get.  Will become a regular!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice people to do businesses with. We drive a long way to get there and it is worth it!  Be sure you sit so you can watch the ducks in the pond in the middle of the restaurant, they are the great entertainment!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I visited here recently and even on a rainy day the place was BUSY! I hadn't been here for years but wanted to see if things had changed. We sat at a table close to the water, service was very good and food was also good. Cave creek and carefree have a few more restaurants but still have that small town feeling. We would definitely return!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was very good. The atmosphere is really cool. I had the chili relleno carne asada and it was delicious. My husband has fish tacos and they were also really good. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last weekend and is now one of my favorite Mexican restaurants!! I'm actually on my way back for more this weekend!!! Love the scenery!"}
{"text":"just had lunch here today and boy this is a sad excuse for Mexican restaurant.  in fact it really fails on both fronts..no real mexican flavors and the service is earnest at times but overall weak..big green pond big deal, who cares!! It is an old and tired spot that does have really good chips and salsa..it's a long way to drive for way average food and bad service"}
{"text":"AMAZING! love the salsa, love the food, love the margaritas!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in Arizona. I come here often with my wife and kids. The Sunday breakfast buffet is my favorite plus the kids love to feed the fish and ducks in the pond"}
{"text":"My Cadillac frozen margarita was outstanding! Too bad the free chips they give you ruin the whole experience. Tasteless chips with awful sauces. One of the three sauces that was given to us tasted like fish. Definitely not something we appreciated. I'd rather pay 1 or 2 dollars more for quality. Take my advice: you either do drinks only, or you pay for an appetizer. Don't do the free chips!!"}
{"text":"Got seated on the patio because there was any empty tables. I saw at least one table, but the patio was fine even if it was a little windy to be out there. We were the only ones sitting on the patio so we were seen three times by our server. The food was mediocre for the price even on lunch specials. The beans were over salted and tasted so unauthentic. My daughter wouldn't even eat her taquitos. I took a bite and understood why. So bland and dry."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the service is welcoming and friendly. The reason for 3 stars is that the bartender had a heavy hand with the margaritas. This is the only place I have tried next to the aquarium so I can't tell you to pass or not. It will fill you up but it's nothing you will crave again."}
{"text":"Food is more 3 star, but the atmosphere and service knocks this baby up to a 4 star! El Encanto is a beautiful restaurant. Not only is it massive, but the outside patio is awesome. Just perfect for our Arizona winter nights. The man-made lake in the back is so pretty and adds a nice ambience to the meal. Supposedly there are ducks and/or swans in the lake, but I didn't see any. You definitely need to make reservations if it is the weekend, seemed like everyone in Cave Creek was out when I went! There is a huge parking lot in the back and it was filled to brim at 7PM on Friday.   I had the Mexicano Combo (taco, enchilada, and tamale). The taco and enchilada were good, tamale was okay, I should have asked for green sauce! Their chips are quite tasty and the spicy and tomatillo salsa were my favorite. Margarita was solid, I felt it after 1.5 (might be a little sweet for some of you though). The boy had a scotch and it was quite a heavy pour indeed. Service was all around A+. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly, as was the food runner, and hostesses. Overall, not a bad joint. I will gladly take the ride out there when the boy's family wants to go!"}
{"text":"Great environment and even better food and even better service. Best Mexican restaurant in the entire area. Must see and must eat place, we could eat here every night."}
{"text":"Love El Encanto. A year ago I would have only given it 3 stars for the poor service but they have improved lately. Like the pond. The food is always good."}
{"text":"Get the Pollo Fundido. Oh my god. Get the Pollo Fundido. I got the sampler appetizer because I couldn't decide. While all of it was delicious, the creamy sauce on the Pollo Fundido makes me want to come back for every meal."}
{"text":"Long wait but Worth it. Beef fajitas & fish tacos were delish, margaritas were good and service was great, Nice place, will return!"}
{"text":"We are local to Phoenix and have been going to El Encanto and El Encanto II for years, though in the last few years we have stopped going as frequently because the service isn't what it used to be and El Encanto II tends to have hoards of unruly children running amok in the restaurant and on the patio. They may be somebody's little darlings, but they aren't ours and the restaurant should take care to make sure all paying customers have a pleasant dining experience. We've literally had to ask to be re-seated because somebody else's dimpled darlings were running in circles around our table. The parent's, seated at the table next to ours, were aware and did nothing. After 30 minutes of the parents ignoring the behavior and the waitstaff looking helpless, we asked for a new table. Apparently parents with unruly children are welcome to bring their children in for a night of babysitting, because children running around the restaurant happens more often than not.  But.....that is not why I'm writing this one-star review. We took some out-of-town folks to El Encanto last night. The place was not as busy as I have seen. In fact there was nobody waiting to be seated when we left about 6:30 last night, so being busy isn't even an excuse. What happened is that they gave us somebody else's credit card. My husband, not realizing, used the card today before he realized it was not his. He called the restaurant and apparently the owner of the other card is not aware, because he has not called in.......at least that is the story we were told. As a result, we have had to cancel our one credit card and hope that the new one arrives before the holiday, as we have plans (or had plans anyway) to go out of town.  My husband spoke to the manager, who gave him a lighthearted \"we're sorry for your inconvenience.\" My husband had to \"suggest\" to him that he take his name and number in event that the owner of the other credit card calls in. They are truly \"real sorry for our inconvenience!\" They have offered no assistance to make this right or fix their mistake. I'm sorry, but this is INEXCUSABLE! It is careless and lackadaisacal and very reflective of the decline in service we have seen over the years."}
{"text":"You'd think for $7 you'd get a detectable level of tequila in your margarita. And you'd think for $8 you'd at least get some rice or beans with your tacos. I think Austin has spoiled me, but we spent a lot of money for not very much in the end."}
{"text":"This place gets a 5 star rating for the atmosphere. The food is also good, but the atmosphere is phenominal and what really makes this restaurant stand out in my opinion.   This retaurant is a bit of a drive for me, but it is one of my go-to retaurants I bring guests from out of town to so that they can get a taste of the Southwest."}
{"text":"Love Ambiance and who I came with to celebrate our anniversary.  But expected more from the food.  Thank goodness the drinks don't lack alcohol :-)"}
{"text":"Really cool Cave Creek spot.  Everything's pretty solid, but try the Queso Guierllmo (spelling?) with a side of deep fried shredded beef (called \"mochamos\").  Yeah, I said it.  Trust me."}
{"text":"Just because some random mexican place has a duck pond doesn't mean you should waste your time and money there.This place is way below average and I live in AZ but it's so gross and unsanitary at this resteraunt that I wouldn't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"I love El Encanto. We recently took my grandma and my kid for lunch. If you haven't been you should check it out. There is a really cool outside patio area around a large duck/turtle pond which really is the focal feature of the place.   The chips and salsa are award winning and the lunch menu is great and really affordable. I had the mole enchiladas and my husband had the fish tacos. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were taking a drive and ended up in cave creek. I looked up on yelp close restaurants and we were actually headed somewhere else when we passed by El Encanto. It looked like it had a great patio and so we turned around to give it a shot. Am I glad we did.   Yelp suggested we try their margaritas, warning that they were a bit pricy but worth it. We shared a small pitcher and it was worth every penny of the $18. I had the lunch carnitas burro and my boyfriend had the lunch chicken fundido. Both were delicious and huge--I can't imagine the dinner size. They also brought out three different salsas, and though we couldn't get enough of the green salsa, they were all differently delicious.   Devin was our server, and she was on top of it. She recommended our meals and made sure we had everything we wanted. Amazing service. And as the other reviews mention, the restaurant itself is gorgeous...with a great pond with ducks and turtles. We are definitely going back and bringing others!"}
{"text":"We always try to bring out of town guests here for lunch. The drive to Cave Creek up Scottsdale Road out of Phoenix/Scottsdale is outstanding. You pass through the Boulders in Carefree and on into Cave Creek, which has a western feel. El Encanto is one of the coolest restaurants in the Metro Phoenix area as far as ambience.  ( See the Yelp photos! )  El Encantos' food is very good Mexican fare too. They have reeally cold beer on draft and Margaritas. This is a great place to bring folks of all ages."}
{"text":"We stopped in, in between attractions for something to eat and were pleasantly surprised! The hot salsa is amazing and the chips were thin and crispy. All 3 of us loved our food. We got the house margarita with grand mariner - we really enjoyed them, a little sweet but to be expected with a house margarita. Service was a smidge slow but he was very kind. Would return again if in the area!"}
{"text":"Although we usually go to the Fountain Hills location, visiting the original location is always great!    Great Food, terrific service.  The best margaritas in Phoenix.  The favorite dish is El Pollo Fundito (if I spelled that correctly ;) )  Enjoy!"}
