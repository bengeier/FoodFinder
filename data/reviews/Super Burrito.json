{"text":"A lot of choices for fast food Mexican in the valley, and this one has to be one of my favorites. The service is great, and the food never disappoints. A burrito is just a mixture of stuff in a tortilla. You need good ingredients, the proper amounts of each ingredient, and a tasty tortilla. Super Burrito generally nails all 3."}
{"text":"The food is okay but there drive thru is hell! No cars in line and I've been waiting for over 25mins. That's bs in my opinion. It defeats the whole purpose of a drive thru. People that go through a drive thru expected to be quick. I hope they read this and step up their game because the food isn't that bad"}
{"text":"I use to be a Los Betos girl, but I have converted over to Super Burrito lol. I still like them, but I find that Super Burrito has more choices and they have things available 24/7. Los Betos no longer has some of their breakfast items available past a certain time as they once did. And they don't let one do some changes to some of their orders the way they do at Super Burrito. And their churros are yummy along with their tongue tacos. I really dig their Arizona quesadilla. For some reason, I find it better as a quesadilla than as a burrito. It's a good place when it's late and you're fiending for some food."}
{"text":"Delicious!   I've been to the one on Rainbow and 95 when it first opened. Fifth time visiting...So far so good, the nachos are BOMB! Lengua tacos are delicious. This place kind of reminds me of Roberto's excluding the oily part.  The price is reasonable just like any taco shop. Small but clean! Also they have a drive thru so if your lazy hello drive thru!"}
{"text":"Used to live in the neighborhood, definitely missed them when I moved. Awesome staff- they remember my order down to the specifics. Ordered from GrubHub, got my food within 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast burritos here. Can't beat the 24 hours being open too. Highly recommended this place!"}
{"text":"I am a picky eater and customer service is huge to me. I can honestly say I have never been disappointed here. I highly recommend their shrimp burrito and if all you have is $5.40 I highly recommend their Two Fish Taco with medium drink. It is delicious, hearty and healthy, loaded with fish, cabbage and their house made pico. I also enjoy their generous complimentary salsa bar. I always go for the Horchata, it's delicious and my food is always served with good vibes!"}
{"text":"Good source to Kill your Carne Asada Burrito hunger!  this thing is big and cheap... real steak sliced up and well grilled (upon request) I always eat it california style which is to have everything including rice and beans inside. I do it \"dry\" style which is no sauce/gravy on top... that way I can pick it up, dump some hot sauce on it and crush it!  this place is open late, in fact 24 hours i believe... I have gone there at all hours of the morning only to find the food cheap and cheerful. The help is friendly, but the bar crowd have pretty much destroyed the bathroom so dont expect much in that department."}
{"text":"Best carne asada fries! Better than the over-hyped dish from Roberto's. Closest to authentic mexican food than going to Mexico yourself. Location was clean and staff was readily available to take our order. Lady who took our order was the sweetest thing! She was chatty and was genuinely trying to help/assist and even brought our condiments to the table. Also, the horchata is the best one I've had versus other mexican food places in Vegas, and I'm hispanic so I know what good horchata's like. So good in fact, I went to refill my drink and pay for it (they charge $1 for refill), and the lady filled my cup and didn't charge me! Cherry on top of my experience. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Save your money. The food is bland. The pollo and carne asada are tough and full of gristle. I've given it many chances and each time they get my order wrong. Bland, bland, bland."}
{"text":"I paid $6 for their \"super\" vegetarian burrito . Biting into my burrito I found it was half empty, hardly any beans, no rice (as advertised), and mostly just lettuce and too much pico de gallo. When I made this point to the cashier she told me there was nothing she could do. \"Super\" Burrito my asshole."}
{"text":"I love this place. My friends and I usually stop here on Friday and Saturday nights after leaving old town. Excellent food that is way more authentic than all the \"berto\" chains on every other block. I've read some of the negative reviews and I have experienced long wait times as well during the day. But after years of going I know they are short staffed during the day because their busy times are only in the evening and especially at night; where the place gets packed. Super friendly and patient staff that has to deal with the loud, rowdy, and sometimes bratty Scottsdale crowd."}
{"text":"The food is good and fresh. Cooked right then and there. It taste just like my grandmothers cooking its old style mexican food . Down side portions are small theres no super"}
{"text":"24 HOURS! It's solid. I moved from California 9 years ago & found Super Burrito superior to any berto this or berto that. Affordably priced for budget I would recommend 3 rolled tacos with cheese & gauc or 5. I love the chicken taco combo plate. 2 chicken tacos beans and rice at a great price. Try the salsa verde aka green salsa seriously flavorful, all the salsas are and they have a salsa bar inside. I always hit the drive thru though, seems to always be fresh and good service. If you want a complaint it would be hard but I would say that they used to make the best California burrito in town. When they used fresh cut potatoes. Somewhere along the line they change to these \"fries like\" more greasy potatoes and I loved the old version so much I just can't even order the California since they changed it. If management or ownership reads this, I would rally call, ok beg, to bring the fresh cut potatoes back to the California burrito Please? The rice is great, little cut carrots and what not add some extra color and flavor. The bathrooms are not great, it's a drive thru, after hours taco shop, so if you need to go you probably should just be happy they have one there. The bottom line is there is no complaints about the food or the hours of operation. It's worth trying out. It's one of the few after hour spots in Scottsdale you can get a decent meal."}
{"text":"been here twice... delish, second time was better than the first time! salsa was super tasty! Roll taco was my favorites"}
{"text":"Great lunch time spot well worth the visit. Try the new offering super burger. 100% sirloin burger for under 8 dollars cant be beat"}
{"text":"Was driving home and decided to stop here because it said Carnitas Super Nachos and who wouldn't pass that up. Got inside and the guy Victor immediately was welcoming and let us try the meat they had. The Carnitas, Carne Asada and Carnitas inside chile Verde sauce was so awesome. We ended up getting the wet burrito with Carnitas and green chile and it was so gooood. Swear this is my new spot. This isn't my regular drive home but it will be when I want sone good food and awesome customer service. Usually I hare going to taco shops because the customer service is horrible but this guy was awesome. If you're by the strip you should absolutely try Super Burrito!"}
{"text":"First they don't have change of hundred second they attend at other costumers before of my when i show first and i recive my food 40 minutes late... Me gustaba mucho pero creo no vuelvo fui su cliente por mas de 8 años."}
{"text":"It's your average grade mexican food. Nothing special but if you're hammered it'll hit the spot. Don't recommend eating sober."}
{"text":"AWESOME food! We're on our way to get one of the discount steak dinners and saw the superburitto sign and made a quick u-turn. I've never been happier to eat anywhere. The service here is wonderful we got to try the different Meats on the menu. And we're taking a plate to go after we're done. If I can get this place 10 Stars I would."}
{"text":"I most definitely would not recommend my worst enemy to this place. My sister ordered the Carnitas plate half the plate was full of fat and the tacos that I ordered didn't even have tomatoes in them when I asked if  I could have tomatoes he wanted to charge me an extra fee. The service f****** sucks bad. The old man that works taking the orders was so rude also when I asked to get refills he wanted to charge me a dollar this place sucks big time. If I could rate a zero I would do not go to this place to eat they probably have roaches in the back somewhere"}
{"text":"yes, if you're looking for something super expensive and fancy, or somewhere to take a date, you'll be out of luck here.  but if you want a hole-in-the-wall mexican place, i feel like this one can't be beat. huge portions, cheap prices, and there's just something about it i can't place. i just love it so.  its breakfast burritos are always there for me if I need them (chorizo, but also poke a hole in the bottom of the burrito before you start eating it because you're going to want a way for the oil to drip out as you eat it). The carne asada fries have helped me through many a boring saturday. by that i mean if i was bored on a saturday afternoon, i would eat them and then take a nice long nap through the afternoon. if you can stay awake after a portion that size, you're probably on meth.   anyway, i'm always going to love this place. i hope the family running it finds a way to get rich off of this."}
{"text":"The first time I saw their sign i lol'ed because it says Super Burrito Super Good!  To my surprise i actually really like the super burrito. Fresh made when ordered. The restaurant is clean and people are friendly."}
{"text":"PASTOR burrito for the total win! Marinated meat, guac. PRO-TIP: If you're gonna go there on a Friday or Sat night late, do it before the bars let out or you're gonna deal with a drunken zoo. I was in 115AM and it was empty."}
{"text":"I always like to say super burrito is super at 3 am but not so super the next morning.  Jokes aside... It's great for that past midnight bite to eat, but with places on 68th street like tacos Jalisco or the amp market open they fall way short.  They do give you good value and solve hunger issues but they are kind of like the last option for Mexican in south Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few years ago and decided to stop by again today 2/24/15. I couldn't remember why I stopped coming. I ordered the steak burrito. I was the only customer, no one inside and only one in drive-thru, however I waited 10 mins for my food after paying and getting my drink! No check in or explanation from workers about length of time. I get to work and start eating and immediately tasted the \"oldness\" (sour like) of the tortilla, not to mentioned it was burnt. I took the food out of the tortilla and put some of the salsa on the food and even worse, the salsa tastes like it's been sitting there too long. So no breakfast for me until I can go for lunch. :-(   I called the place and the worker did not acknowledge my concerns and insisted all their food is fresh. I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"I work down the street from this place and I'm sad I have not made it here sooner. It's really good. Fast, decent price and spectacular service!  I kept seeing others in my area chowing down on these great looking burritos but never went because I have a short lunch break and I didn't want to risk a long wait. Well, never fear, they are QUICK and much better than fast food alternatives.  I had the chile rellano burrito even though most everyone else I know has the Super Burrito. It was great. It came with green and red sauce on the side, beans that were tender flor de mayo style or light pintos maybe, and a decent flavored rice plus the roasted chiles. I ate half of it without any sauce, the flavors of each ingredient were so distinct. I've eaten enough authentic Mexican food to know the various styles and, yes, this is gringo but it's good gringo.   The food is very good and the fantastic service makes it a real pleasure to pop in to grab lunch. I'll be back.  Update: ignore the \"child\" Burrito comment on the photo. Stupid autocorrect."}
{"text":"Worst  service ever will never come back i order 3 reg tacos sat there Staring At The Everyone That were wait for 30 mins top it off i Ordered a drink that was 3 quarters full save ur self from Trouble i rather wait 30 mins at taco el gordo if i gonna wait...my meat was all burnt"}
{"text":"The meat and flavors are good, but every time I order extra meat and pay for it, I  never get it. When I get back to work, I'm ripped off again. I  don't know if they see the order back in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that Super Burrito \"fell off\".  I've ordered twice here in the past few months and the food has not been good.  The burrito (Potato, Egg & Cheese) I'd been ordering for years was extremely greasy and undercooked.  Another time I ordered take out with my friend and the enchiladas were dry, lacked seasoning and the cheese wasn't even melted.  I felt so bad, I cooked up something for her at home.  I'm not sure if there is a new chef, but I am terribly disappointed in the recent changes."}
{"text":"I just moved to Las Vegas from San Jose, CA, and I have spent the past 6 months trying to find a good burrito. I'm talking soft flour tortilla, well seasoned juicy meat, rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole; with salsa on the side. I am excited to say I have finally found it! The staff is super friendly, and the carne asada.... hot off the grill and seasoned perfectly - reminds me of the bay area all the way :)   The one thing that throws you off about this place - it's located inside the convenience store of the Arco gas station on the corner of Rancho & Craig - I took a chance and was so glad that I did :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was really good.  I shared Carne Asada fries and a San Fran Burrito...  asada fries were excellent. Fries were crispy topped w shredded cheese (glad for that because i dont like the nacho chz sauce)  guac tasted fresh and the meat itself was nice tender chunks.  Half star deducted becuase i would have liked more meat.  San Francisco burrito... Fries bacon chicken and salsa... This was good too.   I loved the fact they served our meal with a small dish of shredded lettuce pico sour cream and a dollop of guac. That was a nice touch.  Half star for the wobbly table, that was on my nerves for reals.  Lastly the dining room and bathrooms were clean.  Ill be back to check on that wobbly table and update my yelpers."}
{"text":"Not only did these assholes give me carne asada burritos when i ordered pollo, they looked guilty while I was ordering it so instead of just telling me they were out of chicken they gave me beef which I havent eaten in over 10 years thinking I would fall for it.  I will never give them my business again. Think before you act assholes."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place for a breakfast burrito. It was great and very friendly service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was good, the prices were great an the service was awesome! The green sauce they have was good.. the red sauce they also have was Hot! We had the carne asada breakfast burrito it was freshly made an the food was delicious!! We also got a cheese quesadilla it was good it had a good amount of cheese and the flavor of the food was great!!! Next time I'm in Vegas I'll definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent burrito spot and open 24/7-- what more do you need? Oh, and its reasonably priced as well.  So far, I've tried the chorizo and egg breakfast burrito and the carne asada burrito.  Both were very good, and under $10 for a large sized burrito.  I was very pleasantly surprised at this hidden gem in Scottsdale.  Give it a try for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or munchies in between.  I'll probably be there too."}
{"text":"My friend and I we're hungry and driving around. We came upon this place. The service was great and the food was filling and very delicious. It's an out of the way trip, but we will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Super Burrito for 3 years and stopped by again on the way out of town last weekend. We ordered an Adobada Burrito, which isn't on the menu, but the lady at the counter said no problem. The reason we asked is because the Adobada plate is one of our favorites, the seasoning is perfect and they brown the meat just right. We were so happy with our order that we called back from the road two hours later to say thanks and tell them how yummy it was! We will be going back and we will be asking for another Adoabada burrito por favor! BTW their Carnitas plate is delcious too."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open. Finally I got to try it and wasn't impressed at all. The meat is dry, it takes along time to get your food, no salsa bar. Not worth rushing over to."}
{"text":"Espere 15 minutos por mi comida en el drive thru y me gaste 1 galón de gas .... Ni una soda chica o algo chico que me ofrecieron para decir perdón."}
{"text":"It was around 1am, after exploring the dives along the South side of Old Town and many cervesas later, we were strolling along and the smell of food came to my senses and low and behold to my left was the Super Burrito!  I had flashbacks from college to a joint called Burritos As Big As Your Head and I had to give it a try!  We walked in the door and, how appropriate, there was a guy stoned out of his brains waiting to dive into some late-night Mexican grub Hahah!    It also was very apparent to me because I am a bit of 'clean freak', that the place was very sterile...stainless steel counter tops, open view to the kitchen, clean tile floors...few 24hour places ever look that clean (I have only been here once but I hope it is always like that-extra kudos).  So I walk to the counter and the friendly gentleman asked me what I was hungry for and I had no idea!  So he gave me a brief tour of the menu and I opted for the Super Nachos to share with mi Amigo!  It came covered in lots of yummy carne asada and they added lots of pico de gallo for me, and then we topped it with various fresh salsa from the salsa bar.  And because the street tacos, our stoner neighbor was chowing down on, looked sssooooooo good I had to try two of them too!  FYI the carne asada is better than the carnitas.  We did not go home hungry that early Saturday 'morning'!    As you would expect at such a place, the prices are very reasonable, but what sets this place apart for me was the cleanliness and great service...oh yeah and the food is good, but what isn't at the wee hours of the morning  :)"}
{"text":"New place.  Hard to go against the alternative of healthier Chipotle. I went around 6 PM on a Tuesday and they only had two employees.  The order nevertheless came out fast but if they get a rush there could be a problem.  I ordered the  chicken super burrito which was very tasty ..  Its only super because of what's added in it and not the size.  The size of the burrito is similar to Chipotle's.  Ordered a drink but had no refills.  The price was around $9 which is again similar to Chipotle.  The napkins provided on the table are the ones you have to use  dozen to do the job.  Restroom was out of hand soap.  That all said, you have to sympathize with a new sole proprietor thus the four stars"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to grab a burrito. Prices are low, portions are nicely sized, service is friendly. It's not in the best area, but it's clean and they have a large parking lot around back. They have patio seating but I'd be wary of panhandlers, who are often in the area.  Grabbed a breakfast burrito- meat option for ham, bacon, steak, or chorizo. The steak version was solid and they didn't skimp on ingredients. Eggs in burrito were over-well rather than scrambled as expected, and beans are whole into rather than refried. Overall, taste was fine and I'd try them again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. Worst. Restaurant. Ever. The food is gross, the place is filthy, and the staff is rude. I found a bug in my food and when I complained, the lady working told me to F***off and threatened to call the police if I didn't leave. I would starve before eating here again. Do yourself a favor and dumpster dive from the surrounding restaurants before eating here. The food would be better quality."}
{"text":"BOMB.COM for sure!!! I absolutely love this place!!! My favorite is there San Francisco Burrito ($5.95) it has carne asada, fresh pico de gallo, BACON, French fries. If I came here first I'd think Robertos was biting off them. Much cleaner than Robertos, I want to same the prices are about the same but the quality of the meat and seasonings in there burritos are by far way better than Robertos! Super quick service. I literally had my burrito 3 minutes after ordering. FRESHLY MADE! The serving size is huuuuuge! DONT EVEN LET ME GET STARTED ON THEIR GREEN SAUCE! SALSA VERDE IS THE BESSSST! I can finish a bottle all by myself with just one burrito! I have to have it in every bite! You will not be disappointed! Whenever I'm just craving a burrito, this is my go to spot. Definitely. They do have fries, nachos, tortas, combo plates etc. It's definitely a must try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"My order was very simple, 2 bean and cheese burritos add rice to one. Online the price for a bean and cheese burrito is $3.35, when we get our total it was $11.85?? When asking where that price came from the lady tells me a burrito is $5.50 and that we added rice to both, when asking about why the price is different online she then tells me it's because I asked for extra cheese which I definitely did not. Her answer to me next is \"well you have extra cheese\" and no offer of a refund or break down of why the price was the way it was. Very disappointed in the customer service and the random extra charges I never asked for. Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Purchased a number 5 meal beef taco with enchilada and beans and rice. Also purchased a Separate cheese quesadilla and a separate shrimp taco. Spent about 16 to $17 on all this food. My one beef taco with cheese, enchilada looked and tasted as if it came out of a banquet frozen dinner (only took two bites.....), cheese quesadilla was okay nothing special, and lastly the shrimp taco lacked flavor due to the fact it was mostly rice with barely any Pico and shrimp...... Feel free to give it a try . I personally hate spending lots of money on food that looks and tastes of failure"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town and the girl at the register super nice and polite.... Definitely the best super burritos"}
{"text":"More soggy Rolled Tacos - five of them for $4 bucks. Slightly crispy on edges, but a mushy mess in the middle. This was through the drive-through at about 11pm. These were not good, but they are the kind of item you eat anyway if not good and regret it later. Will probably order a Burro here next time, since thats the name of the place, but they should know how to properly deep fry a rolled taco. Decent red sauce is available also."}
{"text":"Bomb.bomba all the way.  Best mexican food in town. Super burrito is  #1 for sure."}
{"text":"I love the veggie burrito here. They make it huge and put sour cream, pico, guacamole, beans and rice. It tastes like an actual mexican burrito. Not fake like taco bell. The green hot sauce they have is really hot but so good. I cant get enough of it. I reccomend this place for sure. Great authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"A friend and I were visiting from San Diego and decided to get some burritos. This was the first place we spotted on the side of the road. Maybe Arizona Mexican food is different than California Mexican food but the burritos were not great at all. I got the chile reano burrito and it had nothing but the chile and guacamole in it. I was expecting maybe beans and cheese too but nope. My friend got the carne asada and it had nothing but meat in it. We also had to wait a really long time in the drive through when there was no one ahead of us or in the actual restaurant. It was 2 am and I feel like I shouldn't have to wait that long. Won't be a go to spot next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"DONT GO HERE! I got stomach upset after I ate their carne asada burrito. The standard is not as Filbertoes or Riva's.  STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that other Yelpers thought this place was cheap.  Five dollars ($5.00) for a bean burrito is not reasonable, in my opinion.  To be fair, the burrito was pretty large, but I did not like that there was one price regardless of the ingredients.  The real reason that I am even writing a review is because of the poor service.  As soon as I walked in, this large and gruff man said, \"Whaddya want?\"  And after I ordered, there was of course no \"Thank You,\" no eye contact, no smile.  Poor service is my pet peeve, no matter where it is found.  It just irks me."}
{"text":"Ok Super Burrito, you were chosen randomly to be the first Mexican food I had since moving here a few weeks ago. Our relationship is not set in stone yet but our first date was so brief I hardly had time to get to know you.   Let's start with the food, pretty tasty though I could've done without the guacamole and sour cream on my carne asada fries. I did not know what came on the fries beyond the description in the name itself and the guy taking my order didn't offer to say. Moving on...they were tasty and I was not too disappointed in letting you be my first \"Arizonian Mexican Food\".   On to the service, I was greeted in Spanish so I ordered in Spanish. However I am quickly realizing that the Spanish I speak is what they call Castilian and it happens to be a different dialect than what most people here speak. So I did my best to keep it short and so did you. Anyways while the food was cooking I was explaining your menu to my husband and came across the part about you cooking brains and tongues. Well I decided to ask if you knew where I could find anticuchos, which are marinated chunks of beef heart roasted over an open flame, and you looked at me very very strangely and said you didn't know what I was talking about. I suppose Mexican cooks stopped just short of using it after cooking up the brains, tongue, and intestinal walls. I laughed and said it was a Peruvian thing and not to worry about.   ...And so concluded my awkward entrance into the world of Mexican dining in Arizona!"}
{"text":"uhm super burrito whatever you put in your Arizona Quesadilla minus the pico makes that quesadilla so freakin' greasy and good that i used to be enamored by Los Betos Carnitas and Carne Asada quesadillas. I'm sorry Los Betos I still heart you but Super Burrito just got my \"I love your quesadillas\" vote! So yum, cheap, and good!"}
{"text":"3 is exactly right. OK prices for this area (6 for a burrito, 8.30 for super nachos w/ meat, 10 for a dinner plate), not bad food though not artful (a little too gringo-style heavy on the sour cream and liquid cheese). Nothing amazing or worth going out of your way for though. It's alright in a pinch."}
{"text":"It's Friday...strike that, Saturday morning. I have one mud covered high heel. I have had a few vodkas, so have my friends. We took a cab, but that doesn't stop us from getting a burrito. I buy one for the cab driver too since he was nice enough to turn off the meter and didn't mind that my shoe was extremely dirty.    The pastor taco is delicious. The chorizo burrito is delicious. The bean and cheese burrito is delicious, not that you can mess up something that simple. The guy behind the counter is super and puts up with my drunken food requests (basically, that means adding sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo to everything). It also helps that my best friend speaks fluent Spanish and that the counter guy has a crush on me.  Super burrito is not only great for drunk binge eating, but also for awkward heart to hearts with your friends. If you can't say it over burritos on the patio, when can you say it? It reminds me of those 'chew it over with Twix' commercials, only you shove a burrito in your mouth instead of candy bars."}
{"text":"This is the Best Mexican food I have had in Las Vegas the fresh grilled chicken fresh salad bowls are delicious I highly recommend you try it you won't be disappointed that's for sure."}
{"text":"Good good the tacos are great and the burritos are good too different tastes then the regular tacos places"}
{"text":"Super Burrito is very hit-or-miss. I live within a few miles and have ate here numerous times. It was VERY hard for these people to get any of my orders correct.  I ordered a steak, potato and cheese burrito with a lot of sour cream. BOTH times the person repeated my order back to me perfectly at the order sign and the window. What I actually ended up receiving was an old/dry tortilla, very dry steak (that's what I wanted the sour cream for!) and potatoes that were unusually hard and barely cooked. No wonder the service was so quick.   I'm going to give Super Burrito 2 stars because I have enjoyed their rolled tacos on many occasions as well as their chicken quesadilla (so greasy you might go into cardiac arrest!) and like that they are open 24 hours to feed my Mexican food cravings. If you really want a spectacular burrito though..I suggest driving about 15 more min out of the way to get Burrito Express."}
{"text":"This.place is great! Wonderful carne asada no matter what you get it on. There was a group of 5 and we all ordered something different; burritos,  nachos, tortas  and tacos and everyone was very happy! Even better than the food was the service, u didn't get the gentleman's name but he was a delight!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a while, and I thought I'd make a quick stop during my work commute. The food is still pretty tasty, especially the tripas tacos. Mine was hot and crispy, just the way I like it. A squeeze of lemon, and some green and chipotle red chili sauce, makes for a delicious treat!"}
{"text":"The food is what you would expect from a little burrito shop with a drive through.  Filling, somewhat greasy and cheap!  One warning and what made me stop going here was when my boyfriend handed them his debit card to pay and they handed him a slip of paper and said, write your pin number down please.  no thanks, I took my business to Fiesta Burrito."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the fresh delicious food, Super Buritto is the place to go. Say \"Hello\" to Rudy."}
{"text":"Semi off the strip! Yummy asada & chicken. They could use a bit more flavor and seasoning but overall good. The super tacos are hella big and filled with lits of meat sour cream guacamole Pico and cheese oh and beans! Def worth the visit for the tacos! Nachos were super cheesy and OK."}
{"text":"Size is average.  Not too small, not too big.  Flavor is above average tho.  Fresh and super fast service with a home style touch. Very friendly staff.  I wish they would open late hours. Lots of parking available.  Prices are reasonable.  Ex.  5 tacos for $5.25 or a super burrito x $7.55."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast burritos here! Staff is nice and quick to work. My families burritos all came out in less than 15min."}
{"text":"Super Burrito is truly one of the few places that a Blackman from Los Angeles California can go get a quick bite of some real Mexican food. Just how I remembered growing up in L.A. The restaurant was very clean the food smell was intoxicating to the point where my mouth watered waiting. The lady taking orders was very polite and she understood my limited Spanish speaking ability, which always makes me feel good. I truly recommend this Super B."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! i work not to far from there and i get off at 11 pm. I love that they are open 24 hrs. I absolutely love their plain bean and cheese chimichanga. They are always so kind when i call in to place my order."}
{"text":"Super Burrito has been a standby for years, but they recently reduced the size of their burritos and increased the price to $7 from $5.50. They also added chicken wings but a dozen will set you back $10. I asked for a side of Pico and it was $2.19. If I wasn't driving through I could have scooped up as much as I wanted from the salsa bar. Ultimately I will still keep this place on the list but the quality doesn't match the price."}
{"text":"Definitely a decent Mexican food place on the north end of the strip! Friendly service and the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"I like this place the food is respectable, it's clean and the service is decent. I can't put my finger on it but it just doesn't rise to above average territory."}
{"text":"First time checking this place out so I ordered their namesake with carne asada. The difference between their regular burrito and a super burrito is that the super burrito has everything the regular burrito has (beans, lettuce, tomato and cheese) but has sour cream and avocado. Price difference was about 1.50. To me the price difference was a bit steep because the burrito itself was not all that big. You would think a \"Super Burrito\" would be a pretty nice sized portion.   The burrito comes with chips that they made themselves from scratch. You can tell just by the taste alone. The only thing I thought that was lacking was that they don't give you much chips to begin with. Of course if you want more you have to pay extra.   Since I was dining in, they gave me two squeeze bottles of hot sauce. One was red (spicy) and the other was green (med). Both were I thought very flavorful.   Their establishment was pretty spacious and clean. The employees are friendly. They asked me several times if I needed anything and that everything was ok.   Overall I had a nice experience. I just thought that their burritos especially their \"Super Burrito\" should be a lot bigger in size since it's called that. My burrito satisfied me but I feel I should have had a hard time breathing after eating a \"Super Burrito\"."}
{"text":"I have been to Super Burrito a few times.  The sign has always caught my attention.  I mean I like regular burritos, but a \"Super\" burrito sounds better.  I went on my lunch break and the I couldn't make up my mind.  I mean there aren't that many items on the menu.  I was pretty sure I was going to get a burrito.  That makes sense right?  The guy watching the counter was really helpful.  He made a few suggestions and told me what he sells the most of.  I ended up just getting the carne asada burrito.  You can't go wrong with grilled beef.  It was made pretty fast, so if your are here for lunch, don't worry about waiting too long.  The burrito was a good size.  It wasn't huge, which was ok because I didn't want to fall asleep at my desk when I got back.  The burrito had a big garlic taste.  That was the only thing I didn't like.  The taste stayed with me the rest of day.  It was just a little too much.  The meat was cooked perfect and the tortilla tasted good too.  I drowned it in the green salsa they had.  If you are in the area or on a lunch break you have to check this place out.  They have a drive thru if you want to take it to go.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I pass by Super Burrito everyday on my way to work.  One morning, my stomach was a-grumblin' and a-growlin' and so I decided to stop and check this place out.  I decided that if I'm gonna see this bitch on a daily basis, I should at least introduce myself.  Inside was pretty okay.  The interior reminded me of Fat Burger, right down to the jukebox and the angry-looking Mexican dude behind the counter. As soon as I walked in, I remember being deafened with Banda music.  It was playing about as loud as it could have been played, about as loud as those cars with the bass cranked up so high that it sounds like it's farting down the street.  I got my old, classic favorite while I was there:  The California Burrito.  Carne asada, potatoes, chilies and cheese.  They browned the tortilla just right so it was slightly crispy, but not crumbly and not dry.  The tortilla was big and thick too, which led me to believe that they probably made it there.    If Super Burrito were a girl, she'd think I was pervy the way I ogled that burrito.  It was really good.  I think I'll pop in more often and wolf down some burritos.  Bonus is that it's open 24 hours, so if you have the beer munchies or the pot munchies or the regular, I haven't eaten in a while munchies and it's 2 am, you can grab a burrito and gain repletion."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered a burrito without any dairy. Literally told them it was a dairy allergy. And half way through I find cheese in my burrito. Are you kidding me??? I'd give zero stars if I could. Hopefully I make it through the night without vomiting. I'm so pissed."}
{"text":"Awesome burritos but this place needs to get their act together in the service department. The staff are extremely lazy and it regularly takes 15 minutes to get a breakfast burrito when it's not busy. If it's busy don't expect to get your food in under 20 minutes. Management needs to have their people get their act together. This is a fast food place where it takes longer to get the food than many sit down mexican restaurants. They could easily get 4 stars if their service improved."}
{"text":"Great place to have a breakfast burrito.  Price is more than right!  Rudy is cool! They also have locations in SF.  This place is a must!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this place. I love its location right downtown...my two daughters and I walked here to eat lunch after attending the MLK Day Parade. The customer service was awesome. The guy at the counter gave me a sample of the green chili pork (think that was the name) and he delivered our order rather than calling us up to grab it. The food was perfection! I ordered an enchilada plate, chicken nachos, and two Mexican pops, one for each of my girls. We seriously cleaned our plates. I will be back to this place, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great place to eat downtown! AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for the first time! It was really easy to find, They we're really nice to me the lady that works there asked me if I wanted a water while I waited for my food. I got a super burrito and a regular burrito. One of the guys made my burrito really sloppy! But I went back and they re-made my burrito for me. But overall it's was really really good! I will be going back to this place"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Got a bean and cheese burrito with potatoes. The beans were dry and cracked, the potatoes seemed stiff, too. They gave me a cup of each salsa, one green and one red, the green sauce was bubbling like it was left out. Needless to say I didn't try them.  The only thing I liked was the service, the girl that helped me looked pleasant and was very friendly. Also, they did cook the tortilla all the way thru so that's a plus. Maybe I just got the wrong burrito?"}
{"text":"I went here on a trip to Las Vegas and i fell in love with a burrito. I didn't think it was possible to fall in love with a burrito but love is love. We just stumbled upon it and I would stumble for this place any day. The lady was really nice and the chips and salsa were delicious. I have thought about my experience at this small burrito shop in Vegas many times, dreaming of the day that I find a better burrito."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and its a nice alternative to Taco Mexico or Roberto's. There are some items on the menu better than others. I had the San Francisco burrito and the super burrito on different occasion and both are really good but the tacos...I have better tacos at other spots. Salsa Verde is a major factor for me because I simply love salsa Verde; their salsa Verde is good--not bad but not great either. What I do enjoy is the extra tortilla chips on the side and I pour a some salsa Verde on top of it. 3 1/2 stars too bad Yelp doesn't incorporate a half star system."}
{"text":"it's fast and greasy, and i eat here once in a blue moon when i'm up way too early on a weekend for home-improvement, on my way to lowes or the depot.   quick and cheap, and the simple egg and cheese breakfast burrito keeps me full for about 3 days (but i never poo in those 3 days either, so it's probably not that healthy )."}
{"text":"Good fast Mexican food with decent prices. Usually order Hard shell carne asada tacos, shrimp cocktail, or breakfast burrito. Always very friendly at the drive thru. Only complaint I would have is sometimes chips are a little stale."}
{"text":"What's the score of the soccer game? The guy who served us would know.  What he didn't know is what we ordered. The food is great, if only the service was the same."}
{"text":"$4 breakfast burritos the size of Pringles cans.  You know what you're getting yourself into when you come to this place.  I did, at least.  Super Burrito provides cheap food in obscene quantities to dudes on their lunch, people looking to sop up booze at midnight, and people who love to watch Spanish soap operas on a 10 inch flat screen.  I love Super Burrito."}
{"text":"I didn't love my food at Super Burrito, but to be fair, I must tell you that 3 trailer-park, hillbilly, in-bred, DOUCHEBAGS, interrupted my famous \"Taco Inspection!\"   We arrived at Super Burrito at about 2AM on a Friday night (first mistake) and immediately upon entering the restaurant and identifying myself as \"The Taco Inspector,\" these three ass-clowns got in our face and would NOT stop talking crap--even after we got our food and sat down.   The date ended with the Scottsdale Police showing up, and well, at least we got a couple minutes of these cock-noses on video with my flip camera!   You can see the video at www.thetacoreview.com   From what I remember, my tacos were kind of bland, but we will return for a repeat-inspection.  Peace from The Taco Inspector!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I first expereinced Super Burrito at an office party.  I ordered the pork tacos and was blown away by the freshness and tastiness of the taco.  Needless to say since that office party I have been to the Henderson establishment at least once a week.  I usually get the carne-asada quesadilla, taco and enchllata.   A friend of mine recommended that I try Roberto's  taco show and boy was I disappointed.  I could not, for the life of me, understand how anyone could eat there if there is an option like Super Burrito.  If you like fast & more importantly FRESH Mexican, this is your spot.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that they do not use refried beans.   They use pinto (i think?) .  I can not allow that to affect my ratings, since that is a personal preference."}
{"text":"Definitely the place to go for a breakfast burrito...anytime of the day! My go to is a potato egg and cheese. However, all of their burritos are scrumptious. Service is quick, salsa is fresh, and amounts are huge. Love this place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"You get a shit ton of food, but I didn't really care for it. Was your typical Mexican fast food that super close to my house. Gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried it again, and it was still the same quality of food. Will not return."}
{"text":"Wouldn't think it was so good because the building just looks simple and not so catch your eye type! Good customer service they cook the meat there and then!"}
{"text":"I had the breakfast burrito with steak and eggs and my boyfriend had the asada torta and hands down we had the BEST Mexican food we've had in YEARS. We ordered right when we got there and our food was ready within minutes, the whole restaurant smelled like carne asada and grilled chicken. The owner of the place was so welcoming and friendly, it made the experience better for us. He was very nice and helpful and he kept the place clean. As soon as someone finished eating he was already cleaning up the table. The place was clean and well kept and I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good Mexican food with excellent customer service!!! Thank you Super Burrito for the great food!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place several times and finally decided to drop in and give it a try.  After browsing their menu, I decided to order:  Carne Asada Burrito, $4.75 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=eR3xIlBl1b5Cg2yTXHbGJw#eR3xIlBl1b5Cg2yTXHbGJw  Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $4.00 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=WOj1IM7axTeRw4yk49maVQ#WOj1IM7axTeRw4yk49maVQ  While I waited for my food, I went to load up on Salsa.  They have a typical Salsa Bar that you find out here in the Phoenix area Taco shops.  I tried the spicy Salsa and the roasted Peppers Salsa. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=qPz2yJ8gswOPHTYerncIlA#qPz2yJ8gswOPHTYerncIlA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-burrito-scottsdale?select=AvDrycOxAXhouTAGL4COQg#AvDrycOxAXhouTAGL4COQg  After a short wait my food was ready.  The Burritos are pretty large and come with Chips...that was an unexpected bonus.  Before I jumped into the Burritos, I tried the Chips...they were stale, yuck.  I then went for the Carne Asada Burrito....took one bite and was underwhelmed.  There was very little flavor to it.  Ok, another bite....and then another.  Wow, this was the blandest Carne Asada Burrito I've ever had.  Another unique thing was that the Burrito had grilled Onions and Salsa in it....very runny for a Burrito like this.  However, that didn't help with the flavor at all.  As a matter of fact, I only ate 1/2 of it.  Next, I tried the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito....again, it was underwhelming and bland.  I poured the spicy Salsa and Roasted Peppers Salsa on it to give it some flavor....that was it's only saving grace.  Overall, it was a very disappointing dining experience.  Oh well, it happens sometimes.  Return Factor - 2%"}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of my bartender as they called last call at the bar on Saturday, and I was not disappointed.  He recommended the Arizona Burrito, which had potatoes and carne asada, among other items, and it was fantastic.  We also ordered carne asada fries, and those were good, too.  Perfect late night Mexican food, though slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"Other than those of the \"-erto's\" name, I haven't had much luck finding good late night burritos in Scottsdale.   Sure, during the day there is Chipotle, or even Taco del Mar is pretty good, but the missing ingredient to my recipe for constant access to quality Mexican munchies has been the late night burrito shop.   I tried this place last night, hoping it would close the deal, and, for a minute, I thought it had. An abundance of sour cream and melted cheese goes a long way in my book. I had all but decided when I got to the chicken inside my Texas burrito (containing sour cream, cheese, french fries, chicken, sour cream, cheese, and sour cream) I was thoroughly disappointed. It was grisly. A steak can have a knot or two in it, but chicken? This was no knot. These were chicken grisles. First it was one, then another, then another.   The burrito was good size and cheap and was so close to perfection if it weren't for the main ingredients' shabbiness. I may give it one more go 'round with a steak burrito, but my recommendation is to avoid the chicken."}
{"text":"We are always looking for a great burrito place in Las Vegas. I think we finally found it. This is one of the most non-greasy flavorful  chorizo burritos I have ever eaten. It was an excellent blend of beans, eggs, potato and chorizo and melted cheese. You definitely need to check this place out."}
{"text":"I am a pretty obsessed burrito fan and especially mexican spots that serve breakfast burritos. Mexican Street style restaurants are my preferred over the traditional mexican restaurants. I was in Scottsdale for a bachelor party and on our last night in town after drinking all night in old town Scottsdale, I made the decision that I was rallying the crew, calling ubers and finding us late night burritos. After reviewing yelp reviews from multiple places and asking some locals, I settled on Super Burrito as it strongly resembled my favorite place back home. It did not disappoint!! Everyone was really happy with the food and I dont think it was just drunk talk. IF you have late night cravings in Scottsdale, find an uber driver and hit the drive thru!"}
{"text":"How many times have I rolled up on this spot at 3:30am to get a Arizona/california burrito.  hmmmm...  steak, cheese, pico, and home fried potatos and the thing is gigantic. $4 you cant beat it.  this place is EXACTLY the same as Rivas.  Actually all these 24 hour burrito places in valley are all the same.  love them."}
{"text":"The name of this place should be called just \"Burrito.\" SUPER is a little too much. The food was ok. The guy at the register was very funny and showed great customer service, but the food was nothing great. It was average with there being so many great taco and burrito places in Las Vegas. You are not missing out if you decide to drive by."}
{"text":"Currently waiting for my food in the drive thru. I don't care how good this food is going to be because this place has some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. There are 3 people in my car who all have different orders and different questions and before you know it the girl who takes orders complains and asks us to drive to the window instead because she couldn't handle the simple task of actually answering our questions. We waited 20 min to get to the window and order our food because they took 20 min to make the order for the car in front of that BUT WAIT when we got to the window some guy I'm guessing he was the cook says \"so you were the ones with all those questions or whatever SO anyways you ordered...\" Like how fucking rude can you be??? And to top it off the girl who took our order laughed and rolled her eyes when he finished taking our order, I'm sorry you can't handle customers asking you simple questions about a menu you SHOULD know about. Learn how to train your employees properly."}
{"text":"This place definitely has good breakfast burritos. Service was kind and quick. I had never had Mexican food in Vegas but it was good."}
{"text":"The Eastern location is closed. I looked for it 10/22/15 to go eat there, drove around the parking lot.  Tried to google it and  was listed as permanently closed."}
{"text":"I'm really picky about my favorite foods, and menudo is one of them! This is the best menudo I've had in the valley so far. I'll drive about 25 minutes to get it when I want it. It is rich, a little spicy, and the tripe is cooked well. Also, it's not over abundant in hominy like many places, and they have it everyday, not just weekends. As far as their other food goes, I've never been disappointed here. The drive thru is convenient, but still takes some time to get your food. They're often generous with their portions, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Super B Burrito arrives to the Las Vegas Strip, south end!  Located in a somewhat hidden location at the intersection of East Wyoming Ave and South Las Vegas Boulevard, behind the corner ARCO gas station, Super B Burrito is now open for business to feed the hungry masses large quantities of Mexican specialties in Super B style.  Menu items include favorites such as burritos, tacos, salads and the like.  I sampled the breakfast burrito, a simple creation with eggs, bacon and other filling items in addition to a couple of Mexican style street tacos.  Unfortunately, no lime was provided and the tacos were a bit flat.  Overall, the food items ordered were somewhat average in flavor but the quality of the ingredients would make me consider a return visit."}
{"text":"I love Super Burrito! They have the best breakfast burritos in the world. I look forward to eating here every time I'm in town. The bacon, egg, cheese, potato is my favorite, although the ham as well as chorizo are also good. They make a roasted green chili salsa that is amazing."}
{"text":"Pros: Pretty good burritos.  Good street tacos.  I have found better.  They do have really good Chile Verde."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!! The Owner is an Animal. As I was outside the umbrella came flying out of the table and hit my car and almost hit my wife. The \"owner\" could not have been less remorseful. I told him that it was a safety hazard and he replied; \"What do you want me to do about it?\" I then shook my head and told him he was an idiot, at that point he tried to start a fistfight with me. This guy is out of his mind and should most likely be in prison!"}
{"text":"Big food...little money. What do you really expect from a place called Super Burrito?"}
{"text":"so i wake up from my power nap with a super craving for chicken enchiladas. after talking my boyfriend into going with me on the epic hunt for food we take a drive to super Burrito i have never had before). Upon arrival we ordered a carne asada burrito, an order of beef enchiladas (for him) , and an order of chicken enchiladas (for me) with a medium coke. Pulling up to the window we wait and then receive our food. We stopped a few more places after that at the request of the boy and by the time we arrived back i sweating and breathing heavier than a fat girl at a chili fest. I opened the first take out box to find.....beef enchiladas. I opened the second box and found......CHEESE!?!?!? I definitely did not order cheese, that's like going to a burger place and being handed a bun with a slice of cheese. Wheres my damn patty?!?! So here i sit still hungry and now super aggravated."}
{"text":"I'm never rating Fili-B again. Not after discover so many better Mexican Fast food spots. Super Burrito is one of the best! They lose a star only because there is a Strong language barrier here. Unless you're fluent in Spanush, don't dare try to complicate your order. They've got my order wrong twice, but it didn't matter because the food was super delicous. If you're  in Scottsdale, make a stop and get a Super Burrito"}
{"text":"Ordered a Carne Asada burrito , wasn't anything special . The burrito was Decent  but I've definitely had much better. Had an horchata but it was just full of ice , don't plan on using the restroom here , it's really scary looking . On the plus side their green salsa was really hot !"}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered a breakfast burrito & it was DELICIOUS!!! I can't believe I didn't know about this place sooner. I drove from Mesa just to check this place out & I was seriously not disappointed!  Definately authentic Mexican food. So much YUM!"}
{"text":"If you're going for a burrito you can't go wrong at super B. All the food is fresh and delicious.   Had the opportunity to sit and have lunch with the owner today and there's no wonder why this place is so good! It's a franchise with a mom and pop's feel. Do yourself a favor and check it out next time you're craving mexican food."}
{"text":"I swung by Super Burrito after I dropped the baby off at daycare this morning.  Figured I'd try a chorizo and egg burrito.  While it was greasy, I didnt think it was SO greasy that it would trigger a Non-Gallbladder attack.  I was wrong.  So. Very. Wrong.    If I'm ever in the need of a full colon-cleansing, I'll return to Super Burrito."}
{"text":"This place is ok at best, I can see it being very popular after a night out on the town. Burrito is on small side, the rest is smothered in sauce and covered with everything else so honestly you don't know what your eating. The quality of food is ok to good, and definitely a dive place to go when there is no other options."}
{"text":"OMG the chicken bowl was great - I'm on the HGC diet & it's hard finding a place to eat out - so I figured Mexican - boy was I right! I ordered a chicken bowl with only pico .... it needed Nothing else ... really satisfying.  Place was clean & spacious modern... Staff was very friendly, gotta go back & try the beef one... keep you posted."}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada Burrito in town, meat is sooo tender,   Get there before the lunch rush to avoid the lines"}
{"text":"How does a Mexican restaurant screw up a taco?  Carne Asada = steak.  This stuff looked/tasted like day old (wet) dog food. We did get our money back for the 2 tacos that weren't touched, so good on them. But come on guys. Your window says \"Mexican Food\"... what we were served was anything but."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is incredible and the price is great. My husband and I had the Super burrito, the super fries and the San Francisco burrito. Everything tasted great, meat was juicy and had the right amount of heat. I will definitely be telling everyone about this place. Will 100% be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Extreme north end of the strip.  This will be my new regular stop - especially for takeout! Great value, excellent food, and very friendly people working there."}
{"text":"Bomb af! Super nice people and quality Carne! New taco /burrito spot! If you have a big appetite  Try the wet burrito soo yummy! And the Super Burrito is yummy as well!! You can taste the grilled flavor so bomb! And nothing on the menu is over $10! You legit can't beat it for the quality of food you get!"}
{"text":"We are from California and discovered this place the last time we visited. We are back again and decide to stop in on 6/20. The food here is killer!! Just like home! FYI- Real Quac- This time we were in I had the combination plate with the taco & enchilada. The enchilada sauce is very tasty ( most places it's very bland). You can have shredded beef or chicken or one of each if you ask! The Horchata is one of the BEST tasting ones I've had.. Salsas are good and chilled at the salsa bar. Hot carrots prepped & pickled in small bags upon request, they are good. Everything that my family and I have ordered here is sooooo delicious.. Large portions for the price too! We always end up taking some home. We really enjoy this place and will be back again & again. The owners are very nice and accommodating too, such a plus!"}
{"text":"I came in to pick up a delivery order today, I was amazed by the hospitality I received while waiting for the order. I got to try some of the meats it was so delicious I'm now a hudge fan of the wet burrito the green sauce and chicken is mouth watering. Tender meat awesome company that treats you like family. Thank you for making me smile in this heat. I'll be back for sure then I can really enjoy all the greatness   -Tangerine"}
{"text":"Decent Enough Burrito would be a more appropriate name for this place, but you can't blame taco-slingin' restaurateurs for aiming high. On the good side, they offer have slightly bland but passable interpretations of Mexican-inspired fast food. Little miniature tacos for a dollar is a fine deal, allowing you to sample a fine variety of meats in your meal, especially important since pastor is offered. And there's a little salsa bar too, which is a huge bonus for capsaicin junkies, as there's nothing worse than having to plead for an extra couple cups of sauce from stingy taco makers. Can metered doses of hot sauce really be cutting into profit margins? Maybe if the cups were a little bigger, I wouldn't need five of them. Anyhow, with salsa bar, go to town. Get reckless.   It's not all smiles around here, however. The glory of a taco shop lies partially in its propensity to serve up your grub lickity split, but Super Burrito does not subscribe to this philosophy at all. Super Burrito took an astoundingly, amazingly long time. There was only one other customer in the restaurant too, which compounded our confusion. I felt forgotten and unloved, and if I had known about the wait, I would have brought a copy of Atlas Shrugged. Nonetheless, the food does the trick and its available around the clock, meaning you could do worse than Super Burrito."}
{"text":"The breakfast Steak burrito....OMG, I loved it!  I've been there before for a burrito, but it didn't really tickle my tummy!  But the B-fast burrito I ordered Steak, no beans, was awsome!  The steak had so much flavor I was in AWWWWWWWWW    I'm glad I gave them another try!  I will now go back for some Nachos....."}
{"text":"Their green sauce is so amazing I would buy a gallon if they let me and eat it like soup! Can't go wrong with any one of the burritos just pure yummy!"}
{"text":"This was the third time we have been in the last few weeks.  Really good authentic Mexican food and a friendly staff.  Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"Ordered a carne asada burrito at 2:43am, received it at 3:03am. Not much to it and it's a pretty skinny burrito.  Fell asleep waiting for it zzzzz."}
{"text":"I can now say I've waited 25 minutes in a drive thru line... The food was decent, definitely made fresh as it was hot when I got it... but the fact that there was a small child running around the kitchen was a bit unnerving. Overall not worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Hello Yelpers! While visiting in Vegas we were looking what to eat, we are not big fans of the big restaurants and fancy stuff!!! Plus who can afford that 3 times a day right??? Haha, right? Right? (Come one i cant be the only broke one here!)  Anyways this place will do the job, the prices are somewhat reasonable.  6 bucks for burritos Carne asada fries about 8 bucks  Food was good, a little to much on the American Mexican food, we got a burrito had sour cream, cheeses, beans, guacamole, pico de Gallo and the choice of meat, we got carnitas! Very good choice! Tender meat, the burrito was smaller than what one expects from a Mexican place but over all good taste!  My kids got quesadillas with meat, now those were big!!!!   But if anything the guest service was the best! The gentleman behind the counter Victor was pretty chill, genuinely nice and super nice to my kids!  Like I have said in the past, service is a big deal for me!   People come in first for the food but they return because of the service!  We coming back!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it's always really good food. Made to order. Breakfast burrito bowls are my favorite."}
{"text":"The term \"Super\" is definitely relative. It was definitely  not  large comparative to MOST of the spots in LA... but I will say it was VERY flavorful. Had a good balance of cheese vs meat vs beans vs guacamole etc. Loved that all of the components were available in each bite as well.  No pics because it went fast... but I would go back... probably for nachos."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, no complaints on that. Good quality. Just waited at the drive thru window after ordering for over 10 mins watching them stand there. That was pretty brutal. Other than that, good grub."}
{"text":"Great tasting tacos and speedy service. The food is quite good for being a drive threw Mexican joint. I recommend it."}
{"text":"So go thru the drive thru and get ignored. No one answers then decide ok I will go inside. Once inside the only person in the place doesn't acknowledge I am there while he is making good and I am there at the counter waiting 20 min and not one word. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Do yourself a favor and get something with the carne asada, I personally like the California Burrito. SB has the perfect mix of quality and affordability, and we've been thankful for its 24 hour availability multiple times."}
{"text":"This is not my go to mexican fast food but since I moved to old town this will have to do. I've ordered their carne asada burritos and they are okay. My favorite is the 3 rolled tacos with guac and cheese. I always ask for their extra hot salsa and boy does it have a great kick! I still have to try other items on their menu to see if it will eventually become my go to place"}
{"text":"Good cheap mexican food...that's it.  Don't come expecting more than that.  I like it during the day though because, again, it's cheap, good and the portions are pretty hefty."}
{"text":"Average Mexican food w/good service.  Like the corn quesadillas, chile relleno burrito and tacos.  Not really street food nor super except the prices.  Go during the day as it's next to Olympic Gardens and you might get distracted.  Plates available.  Good beans and drinks."}
{"text":"Ugh I ordered a fish taco and they gave me a beef taco , seriously with only me as the mere being in their restaurant that one afternoon how can they mistakenly pull out an order. Nothing more would piss you off when you are so hungry anticipating a good fish taco and came home open your bag to a wrong order!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and knowing their food I expected them to have a 4 1/2-star average. They make the best chicken burrito anywhere. Loaded with tender chicken and nothing else. Their sauces are made fresh daily. Both the red and green sauces are outstanding! The green has a fresh cilantro taste. Yum! My brother's favorite is the red. You can go inside and get fresh vegetables and roasted peppers. Or ask for them at the drive-thru."}
{"text":"Tasty little burrito spot that has been here for at least 15 years. Have eaten there late night because they are 24 hours. Picked up 4 different breakfast burritos for myself and my crew. All served with cheese eggs potatoes and added different Meats. Got one sausage one machaca one bacon and one chorizo. They are all $5 and pretty darn big but more importantly very tasty and cook to order."}
{"text":"I really don't see how you can give this place anything other than a 4-star rating. Subtract out the fact that you're in Scottsdale and it's more likely than not that there will be one or more douchebags inside (i believe it's called a murder of douches when they travel in a pack) as well as some of the ironic hyperbole of the name, and the place is pretty damn good.  I've had the carne asada (sober) and the california burrito (somewhat less than sober) and I have to say both were sold efforts. In fact, I have yet to find a clearly superior burrito in Phoenix (caveat: I am not a fan of the southwestern style carne asada that is very dry & heavily chipotle flavored). The burritos here are more Americanized mexican style and a little sloppy at times. But it's all flavor juice as far as I'm concerned.  So can I recommend this place? yes. Will I go back? Yes. Am I expecting a transcendent burrito eating experience in some little-known hole-in-the-wall gem? Nope, and I'll be sure to use the drive thru next time to avoid the murder of douches inside."}
{"text":"The burrito was bland, I ordered the super burrito with carne asada. Honestly I felt the burrito was overpriced for the taste. The balance on the ratios for the meat to condiments weren't correct. Service was good which is why they are getting 3 stars."}
{"text":"So I see a new spot at the end of the strip called super burrito... Let's just say that I am SUPER disappointed!!!!!   Let's start from the time I walked in there were two people flirting with each other, I then started to ask about prices to which the female didn't know.  She began to take my order and then all of a sudden was interrupted by a  kiddie shoving match flirting session again while I stood there and waited  to complete my order.  So I ended up paying $9.04 on top of the $0.45 debit card charge whatever no biggie.  I was excited because when you go to Baja they give you a full plate. But when I look at my to-go plate which was not even a full size to go plate it was not even full it was a little over half full. I reached out to the cook and asked him is this all I get for over $9. He said yes.  I asked for a little more, he said \"no\". I informed him that this was disappointing and that I would not come back. He responded with \"that's fine\" in Spanish.  I was shocked at the response so I informed him I will now leave a review about this place. Again responding with \"that's fine\".   At that time I requested my money back.  it usually takes a lot for me to write a negative review but this place was horrible unprofessional/ portions were small/ employees don't know their own product and they are too busy horsing around and flirting. I will never be back and will make sure I spread the word."}
{"text":"Super B is the real deal. When you're on that late night creep or looking for a quick fix they got you covered. Been going here for years. Even when I was living abroad anytime I'd find my way back to the Valley I would make beeline for it."}
{"text":"Sadly, Super Burrito has CLOSED. It is now some place called \"Carnitas y Tortas Ahogadas.\" They apparently specialize in tortas. They still have a \"Super Burrito\" on the menu, but it was anything but. Quite awful, unfortunately.   Hopefully the other location on Eastern is still open."}
