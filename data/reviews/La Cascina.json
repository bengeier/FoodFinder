{"text":"Very good food, drinks and service. I will be going back for sure!! didn't get dessert but others who did loved it."}
{"text":"Very disappointing especially since it's on Joanne Kate's top list. We started with the 5 tapas, all were fine but none great, then pasta carbonara which was good, and then veal which was tasteless. None of our food came hot despite complaining twice."}
{"text":"This was a very different experience and one that we would choose to do gain. The resteraunt and the front of house staff were casual and friendly with only one goal in mind. To take you on a trip to the Abruzzo region of Italy, and they accomplished that with ease. Some of the reviews that I had read said the portion sizes were small and they are right, but by the end of the meal I was comfortably full. The food was cooked to perfection, my only complaint that I had was the gnocchi was in a lamb ragu and the lamb was MIA, had this not been the case this would have been 5 stars. The  Tiramisu was the best I've ever had. We will be back and thank you for a great date night ."}
{"text":"Buonissimo!!!! Spoken from a real Italian that spent 5 years living in Toronto and searching for a true Italian restaurant. La Cascina delivers... This restaurant is not for the diner looking for North American pastas like \"Alfredo fettuccine\", the Chef cooks only authentic dishes from Central Italy and is very particular about what he serves and how he serves it.  If you are not into waiting for a made-to-order meal and not a fan of sitting down through 2 or more courses then this spot is not for you.   Grazie mille for finally showing Torontonians what Italian food and the Italian dining experience is really about!"}
{"text":"Italian restaurant that serves food typical of the region of Abruzzo. If your a picky Italian who is reluctant to go to an Italian restaurant, this place is for you.  If you love Italian or slow food this place cannot be missed. Owners Luca (chef) and Sharifa (service) create a fresh and welcoming environment with a changing menu for each service, emphasis on quality, local sustainability and professional service."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my favorites in Toronto and a secret cure for the Monday night \"eating out blues\" when most good Italian restaurants take the night off.  Excellent food, thoughtfully prepared.  Even the insalata mista signals that you are in a better place than usual. How? very clean and cold lettuces, tasty tomatoes and and high quality olive oil, a light hand with dressing, hand tossed.  The pastas reflect the same personal pride and care, while the atmosphere is low-key, friendly and accommodating.  For now, it's a sleeper--not to be missed."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great ambiance! Decent Happy Hour price. I agree with one of the review, home made pasta dishes. The fettucini and the pappardelle with plain tomato sauce are as good home cooked.."}
{"text":"The star system isn't exactly reflective of my 3.5 rating I want to give the restaurant. It misses the four star because I was disappointed in the overall substance of some of their dishes. I wasn't expecting large portions, rather expecting to eat more substantive ingredients. The service and ambiance was welcoming and extremely friendly.  More on my hopes of substance revolved around the Rigatoni con Sugo di Pannocchie. The sauce was very good, but I was somewhat surprised with the mantis shrimp that was part of the dish. It would have felt better without offering the two \"token\" shrimps which weren't really fit for easy consumption, and the loose shells/legs detracted from the dish. I personally was expecting (especially after the verbal description) a couple of massive shrimps and perhaps some other seafood complimenting the dish.  Overall, we were satisfied with Cascina, and would like to return to try their different offerings as their menu is different day to day."}
{"text":"This is not a quick 'catch-a-bite' place but rather a full evening dining experience. They whisk you off to Abruzzo Italy for a couple of hours as they present local delicacies and other delicious offerings. Since January, they've started providing printed menus of their nightly offerings; however, it still changes daily. They only book one group per table per night so you do not feel rushed at all.  The four of us went with their recommended full-dining experiences which consists of 6 courses. The first course was the meat and cheese plate which is small but a good sampling of the different options. The next course was their daily tapas which had something for everyone. We ordered two different types of pastas which were offered and plated separately. Following the second pasta course was the meat course which was the only course that I was not overly fond of but that was because meat is never my thing. This course was coupled with the salad course which had a perfectly mixed salad. We weren't going to order dessert, but figuring we were going to go home and have something sweet anyway, thought we would go all out and order dessert as well. We were all glad we did, it hit the spot.  The pacing of the courses can seem frustrating at first but they know how to do it so that at the end of the night your hunger is satisfied. For anyone who wants an evening in Italy but can't leave the city this is the place to be. According to the hostess, you can also call in advance if there is something specific you would like them to make on that night.   Although I won't be there often, it's somewhere that's on my 'I will be back' list and highly recommended to others."}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets. Great home made pasta dishes. The fettucini and the pappardelle with plain tomato sauce are as good as my mamma makes. Shhhhh...don't tell her I said that. The gnocchi are just as awesome. Perfectly firm and delectable. Meat and fish dishes are always changing. Very good wine selection that is reasonably priced. Not your usual extensive \"menu\". The selection is moderate but whatever me, my wife or kids choose, we are always impressed...That's why we keep going back."}
{"text":"Unreal. The food and service were just incredible. The server was as caring as she was knowledgable. If you love fresh rustic Italian food you must come here."}
{"text":"mere words are difficult to express how bad this place was.  After arriving and being promptly seated we then waited for 30 minutes with a glass of water for company.  Not even a menu or wine list to look at.  The owner/host/server would come by and say that she would be right with us.  Waiting, waiting...Finally we were able to order and the antipasto was a disgrace.  2 paper-thin slices of 3 kinds of meat and some cheese.  Taste was good but it was minuscule.  My wife ordered what was described by the owner as a pasta with a lamb ragu.  The closest lamb got to that dish was to have been walking past the restaurant.  Other reviewers talk about being served authentic food.  We had trouble finding service. (that is why I marked a no for waiter service - it just did not exist.  We eat dinners out on average 2 to 3 times each week.  We have walked out of 3 restaurants in the past 15 years and this should have been number 4."}
{"text":"I was sent to La Cascina by my Yelp Friend!   Happy Hour: drinks for $10 with complimentary Italian appetizer!   Rustic Abruzzo food: meat and seafood based since Abruzzo is located in South Central Italy with mountain and by the coast.   Nothing rustic about La Cascina decor! Love the dark wooden and blue theme. The decor is quite chic and I was welcomed with open arms. The restaurant is small, cosy and the services are attentive and friendly.  Bar stools are cushioned with padding and are quite comfy as I enjoying my aperitivo by sipping my white wine and enjoying my snacks.   The little plate includes cheese, beans, peas, sausages and rice ball. After the savoury item, my friendly waitress presented me with Salame di Cioccolato which is a traditional Italian holiday treat. The lady that made the sweet was sitting right next to me and I have to tell her that it was the best part of my Happy Hour!!   I really like the concept of having a daily menu as it is depends on what kind of fresh meat/veggie/fish they get from their suppliers. Some of their ingredients are shipped directly from Italy too! Price point wise a main is around $20 which is reasonably priced.   I can't wait to go back and try out some of their home made Italian comfort food...... Hopefully soon!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal time and experience. We were visiting Toronto for the weekend (HHOF-bucket list)... and the bf found this gem. We're Italian food snobs.. and ordinarily would rather cook it ourselves. However, this place was excellent and trumped expectations. We took the subway to Lawrence station and walked about a mile to the restaurant.  When we sat, the lady mentioned how this was 'farm to table' style, etc...  we ordered the mixed antipasta, the truffle porcini pasta dish, and the veal. Each dish was spectacular. I'm pretty sure the pasta here beat any pasta I've ever had (including other places with fresh pasta).. the veal was also the best veal cutlet's I've ever had. Tender pieces, but also thick and not just bready. Also had a bottle of abruzzo red that paired well with the meal.  Would definitely return if I was back in Toronto. Small restaurant, but didn't feel squished at all. Def. make reservations as we had them at 7 and had the table for the rest of the evening. 5 stars!"}
