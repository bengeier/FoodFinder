{"text":"Food was GREAT.     Service was GREAT.      Place was spotlessly clean.      Ill be back often !!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I go there since it open, staff is very friendly, large dinning area, Excellent  customer service, the chicken is full of flavors, today I order a Pargo Fish it was delicious. Prices are reasonable and the portions are pretty big, you will not be disappointed . Definitely a must try !!"}
{"text":"The carne asada plate was very good and so were the empanadas. Wished they had refills but its cool. They are still in developing into a successful restaurant. So far so good. Will come back to for more.."}
{"text":"For a quick bite, good food and flavorfull, good fast service. Price about  $14 a plate good portion. Empanadas is bomb"}
{"text":"Okay, so I am Colombian so this is no touristy review!!!  I am the real deal, Authenti second generation Colombian!  This place is awesome!  It reminds of my childhood in more ways the one!  The white rice and Colombian beans have that Colombian unique taste (if you are Colombian you know what I am talking about!).  The platains were not dry but moist and sweet, a Colombian must!!!  The carne asada plate for like $6, are you kidding me (I wish I lived in Vegas... but I will eat here every time I visit!!!  For reals!!!).  The carne asada reminded me of Mom's!  I  ordered the rotisserie chicken for the ride home to SoCal and grabbed a quick bite for this review...  LEGIT!  And finally, Colombian Cumbia's playing softly in the background!  CALLING ALL COLOMBIANS IN VEGAS...  CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!  If we don't support, who will!!!  Now for a couple disappointing items (but certainly not deal breakers)...  The arepa was below Colombian standards...  chewy and stale not crispy and crunchy.  They ran out of Colombiana (the Colombian national soft drink for you yelp'rs that don't know).  The nice part about this however was that they did have Postobon (Apple soda) and I usually always choose Colombiana (bc you have too if you are legit Colombian!!!).  I hadn't had Postobon for over 30 years...  What a delight!  Btw- anyone who calls themselves Colombian but writes a review spelling it Columbia...  has no idea what they are talking about, just say'n!!!  Enjoy my friends!!!"}
{"text":"Súper recomendado súper limpio la comida súper buena buenos precios pregunten por Susan o Julieta muy buenas meseras"}
{"text":"Fantastic place with a great special you can get all day long! Chicken or steak with rice, beans and salad! $5! And quickly prepared too! I've never had Columbian flavors and I'm not dissapointed! It's delicious. Staff is very friendly! Will be back to try everything!!!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time, i liked the food but i would like more soup like ajiaco or sancocho and some other colombian dishes."}
{"text":"I'm impressed with the way the chicken and empanada came out. The chicken breast is what I was worried about the most and it came out very moist. It was perfection throughout and it was perfectly seasoned. The empanada was cooked to the right amount of crispyness. It broke when you put a fork to it and didn't collapse on itself. I will be bookmarking this place just to see how well they do in the near future. Service was great as well. The amount of food you get for the price is great too."}
{"text":"It is just so good and affordable, really nice staff and the food comes in a big plate so delicious,the music everything is just perfect! Thanks"}
{"text":"Great place! With great food! The chicken  is very tasty and the empeñadas are great!!  The people their are very friendly.  Want a taste of Colombian food than I highly recommend this place!  Great place to go with family and friend!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, simple menu, but pretty diverse, you have to realize that the majority of Colombian food is meat based, so the menu is not over whelming. The don't skimp out on their portions either, I had to take my food home I was so full. The dining area is very big and can accommodate a large group if needed. There is a kitchen area, and a desert area (sweets and mixed drinks/fruit malts) are in two separate rooms. Service was excellent, and the waitresses we're very friendly. I very much recommend this place and plan on going back again soon."}
{"text":"Food is great, Reasonably priced. Waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  We had the carne asada plate and Bandeja Paisa.  Also had an arepa and empanada...very good.  Shopping center/area are a bit run down but the restaurant itself is very neat and clean.  Good choice for something different and inexpensive while in Vegas."}
{"text":"What a wonderful new addition to the neighborhood they have an amazing special 4.95 every day until 9 p.m. steak or chicken with rice and beans and salad. Loving the Colombian flavors and spices very nice atmosphere with great music"}
