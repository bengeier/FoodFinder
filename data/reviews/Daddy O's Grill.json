{"text":"Went for a celebration.... we got there a little early, we ordered drinks and some snacks.    They ran out of BACARDI rum, seriously, the waitress says no one ever orders it?  If no one ever ordered Bacardi, then wouldn't the bar have it??  Then when the celebration started, we ordered shots for the celebrant.  I had a shot of Patron and either the bar tender is stupid or incompetent.  I was not served Patron Tequila, it was some horrible off brand that they tried to push off as patron.   It was not served cold either and the other shots were not name brand either even though we asked for name brand .  I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"The best chicken fried steak in the valley!!! Always friendly staff, prompt service and good food at a fair price."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 times since the new owners took over. The first time was ok..just went for drinks and wings. That was a Sunday evening and all was OK. The next visit was several months later for the comedy show. That was a few weeks ago. The restaurant was uncomfortably warm. The waitress messed up our order at least 5 times. The manager/owner could be heard yelling at the staff to speed things up...apologies for being short-handed and a delay to be expected on the food. The comedy show was \"awful.\" I have been to other free comedy venues in horrible dives and had a much better experience. We left before open mic because it was just so hot in there. Yesterday I gave it another try. I ordered the fish fry and what a mistake. The \"fish\", which are advertised in the menu as fresh battered, not frozen, had no fish flavor at all. If it is possible, they tasted water-logged. I think it was minced fish products that had a REALLY bad batter/coating. In addition, they had been cooked in too hot, too over-used, oil. The accompanying fries would have been OK if not overly salted. The coleslaw was good. We went for a Happy Hour but was told they only offered drink specials (very limited there, too) and that they were working on a Happy Hour menu. The \"crowd\" that was there (5-6p.m.) seemed to be, for the most part, in their 50's and older.  I doubt I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great experience here! The service was outstanding, as well as the food. Definitely a 'good vibes' environment.  We were waited on by Amber who was a delight! She was on point the entire visit. She was very helpful with the menu and options. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The fish was excellent I would go back. But when I went to pay the bill with cash the waitress helped herself to a tip of $5 had she not done that I will have left her more. Good food bad waitress. IF I GO BACK and THE SAME WAITRESS COMES up to US I WILL MOVE OR LEAVE"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! Friday afternoon and we sat for 15 minutes. Not one person greeted us. We left!! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Arrived late into Phoenix. They were open with a full menu til 12 midnite.   Awesome late nite light dinner freshly prepared.... Very impressed . When in the next morning for breakfast and once again They OVER delivered in regards to quality, quantity and flavor at a very affordable price. You guys Rock!! You"}
{"text":"I do not understand how anyone can write a bad review about this place!  It is the best place I could think of to start off my day!  Our server Danielle H was hands down the BEST SERVER I have ever had anywhere!! My drink was NEVER EMPTY with her amazing attention to us and she ran EVERY table in the place. That says alot not to mention she doesn't forget anything we asked for no matter how busy she was! You can't beat a $3.99 yummy breakfast!!  I love that country music was playing and I could watch football on one of the MANY large projection tv's.  This is our #1 favorite local hangout!!! Don't judge it based on other bad reviews (maybe they were having a bad day and needed something to complain about) LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"We go there pretty much every Sunday for both the Viking and Cards football games, and have never been disappointed. There are lots of friendly fans cheering on a multitude of different teams (lots of TV's), and we've never experienced anything but friendly rivalry. Sure it gets loud - HELLO - it's football!!!  If you don't want \"loud\" during a football game, don't go to a Sport's Bar! The breakfast specials and bloody Mary's are great, and we've always had good service too! David is a great manager and bends over backwards to accommodate game requests. We also participate in the Trivia games on Thursday night and have never yet been disappointed with the food or the service."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and awesome service! Danielle H was awesome!  The sunrise special breakfast was excellent and even the bus boy was very polite. I highly recommend this place any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Great bar..a must see if ur in the nw valley..had breakfast there today...very in expensive, alot if food. ."}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was Casey Jones it was much better then."}
{"text":"this place is a real disaster. i came in with my wife we waited for ever for service.. finally the server came by and we placed our order..we came in for breakfast and i think they were grinding the coffee beans by hand because it took forever for a cup of coffee.  our meal was cold when it finally came to our table.. i asked for the manger to come by and the server said there wasnt one at the time but the owner is here but he is real busy right now...lol there were only two other tables with customers .  aparently the owner doest care about his customers..we will never go back again.."}
{"text":"Last time my daughter visited from Cali I took her here and she LOVED it! So this visit she wanted to return and we were sadly DISAPPOINTED! Our server ignored is most of the time and when she took our order never smiled. We offered salads and waited over an hour to get our food. The server was running around like crazy while the bartender (we heard she was the manager) sat at the bar drinking, chatting and rolling silverware. The cook called ORDER UP and we knew it was our food but watched as both these employees did not go to the kitchen for another 1/2 an hour! Needless to say we won't go back which is too bad because the food is always good .... As we were leaving another employee arrived noticeably late for her shift."}
{"text":"I've been in twice now and I have to admit that this spot is nice the day after a long night. Food is pretty average but everyone is extremely nice and overall the place is pretty quiet in the morning/early afternoon."}
{"text":"Great place! Had a blast friday night singing karaoke. Burger and fries hit the spot and the beer was cold!!!!"}
{"text":"I just got back from Daddy O's and honestly, this was the worst customer service I've EVER experienced. It all started when they brought out the \"coffee\" which was not only see-through, but had no flavor at all. When I told the waitress, she actually told me to try it, like I was 12 years old. I told her that I know that I do not like coffee that is see-through, and that I would like another cup that was like real coffee instead of watered down nonsense. So then the owner comes out, and just poured the same batch of coffee into an opaque mug instead of a glass mug. And I could still tell it wasn't going to be right. He apparently took it personally that he can't make decent coffee, because then he started blaming his vendor, telling me he made it per their instructions. Meanwhile, the food took so long, that my cousin and her boyfriend had to cancel their orders and leave because they had an appointment.Well, apparently they canceled the wrong orders, because when the food finally came they brought the two canceled meals, and not the other two. So now, my Aunt and husband have to wait 20 minutes longer for their food. There was a shift change and I guess the woman who took our order wasn't even an employee, she was just \"helping out\". The real waitress shows up, and was actually very nice and was sincerely apologizing for everything. The owner is just a douchebag, to be honest. On the way out, he tells my husband that he was sorry the coffee wasn't good enough. Gee, that's a great way to deal with your customers, and he is so lucky that I didn't hear that. We won't be coming back OBVIOUSLY, and I'm sure they won't be in business for long. The owner could certainly use some customer service classes, because he has no clue how to deal with people.  The customer is always wrong at this place, and I would NOT recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"Gone twice. First time the service was a little slow but the food was tasty so we decided to give them another try. Went for breakfast and waited one hour for our food as we watched other gets served that had ordered after us. It's breakfast, there was no reason it should take this long. Gave up and left since our food was still no where in sight.  Disappointment sums it up in one word."}
{"text":"Driving by I saw the sign for Daddy-O's Grill.  Being hungry for a burger I stopped in.  Great experience!!!  My wife and I were immediately greated by the friendly bartender Erika.  Drinks appeared promprly and she helped match us up with perfect BURGER selections that met our taste buds to a 'T'.  The have nightly food and activity specials that would appeal to most everyone.  It's  Wednesday, but I'll  be back before the week is over.  You should give Daddy-O's a try too!!!"}
{"text":"It was horrible. They ran an ad in the vets thing for buy one get one free. So we decided to try it out. It was horrible. Food was nasty service was horrible!!!!! Beer was warm all around do not stop there. I rather go to Taco Bell and I hate Taco Bell. What a horrible waste of money and two hours of waiting!!!!!"}
{"text":"-1 Star for always having \"turned\" ketchup.  Aside from that, breakfast is great at this place.  I love the chicken fried chicken portion.  I have only been here for breakfast, but it IS one of my favorite spots for it.   I don't know what gives with the revolving staff, but they are always friendly."}
{"text":"Alex, our server is GREAT!   KARAOKE ... I saw that karaoke and football are also hosted here... so I thought I'd try the karaoke night... what a mistake!  The host, Kevin DRANK and SWORE (the 'f' word no less MORE than he hosted.... he's THE SINGLE WORST karaoke DJ I have EVER encountered!  Jumping his friends (3 people/3 songs) in front of newbies (1 person/1 song), so they could leave... is SO unprofessional.... and.... Kevin took more 'smoke' breaks, along with his girlfriend and friends than any other karaoke host I've ever seen... just so you know, I go to A LOT of karaoke venues... hoping that the management gets rid of this guy soooon!    FOOTBALL ... haven't tried this yet but plan on going to see the 49ers or the Cardinals....  Anything MUST be better than the karaoke host!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible service food sucked the only that was good was the fried fish but we only seen waitress 3 times in 2 hours. Ridiculous.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. The waitress with straight long brown hair must have walked by us 4-5 Times and never said hi ,much less took our order. She spent most of her time discussing the books with the supervisor and often was in his office leaving the tables unattended. There was one one poor gal behind the bar holding down the fort. We liked this place but will take our business elsewhere.If I ran my business of over 100 staff like this guy ran his  today,I would close the doors in no time."}
{"text":"We come here 2 to 3 times per week. Tonight was the first time I EVER walked out of a restaurant. Waitress comes over and takes our drink order and says she'd be back with menus. When we FINALLY got our drinks,, she asks if anyone took our order. Umm, no, still no menus.  We ordered the fish like we always do on Friday. Over an hour later we put money on the table for our drinks and left. They have lost a pretty good customer."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken strips...and a diet Coke. The bill came to 12 bucks. The strips were only 8 dollars! Therefore a plain diet Coke had to be over 2 dollars! A bit pricey on drinks! As most places  The chicken strips were overcook Ed.  Ah well..."}
{"text":"Not only is the bar dark, out dated and clearly needs some TLC but the staff is rude and inconsiderate to the bar patrons, some are downright incompetent when it comes to the service industry. This particulary blonde bartender asked EVERYONE at the bar if they had thrown up in the bathroom.. not only is that totally unprofessional but unnecessary.. clean it up and continue on because it's your job.. you work at a bar! I've had nothing but bad experiences here so it explains why it's always empty."}
{"text":"Service is lacking unless you are a regular, and as such the fish was delivered cold and soggy. too many other choices to be ignored and poor quality food."}
{"text":"Love the fried PB&J!  Delicious food and great people!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd and very last time we will give this place a chance.  Mothers Day Sunday, 2017, we went in at11am for brunch.  An HOUR later we still had no food.  The manager and owner blamed it on a large party in the room.  I told the owner I didnt care about that and this was the 3rd time we'd been in there and the service is always horrible!  Adding to my frustration is a family behind us with little kids who were expected to \"behave\" and being threatened with the belt when they left when they had to wait an hour for food.  Fu*k that, we left.  Oh and before anyone thinks they were really busy on Mothers Day there was probably 30-40 people in the whole place.  Not a reason to keep people waiting an hour for a basic breakfast!"}
{"text":"Messed up my simple drink.  Bartender kinda dumb and slow.  This place was better when it was Casey Jones.  Wont be back and dont recommend.  Go to Pullanos up the road if you want to be treated better and have a bartender that knows how to make drinks."}
{"text":"Food is amazing , David knocked it out of the park . Great menu great service great prices . It's a must go if you have not been . I will be back much more . Thanks daddios."}
{"text":"Friendly service! Good food. Bathrooms need a remodel, but they were clean. The green chili burger was very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"What a lovely place to eat and be entertained.  I want to particularly thank the servers who helped us this past Saturday (1/13/18 from 6:30PM-closing) during a Tribal Belly Dance drum circle at this establishment; the atmosphere was incredibly hectic with people everywhere, sitting and standing, with no indication of who will eat or not. It's difficult to complain about the wait when I clearly saw these poor ladies running around all over the place with several plates of food in their arms.... Food and drinks were excellent, as well. I'm not in this area often, but I will be back, especially for another event. Please tip your servers !!!! Thank you, ladies!"}
{"text":"In search of fried pickles. An order of fried pickles was $6.99. We also wanted nachos so we decided to order the Combo Platter instead. We got picked fries, nachos, fried mushrooms and zucchini, poppers, 2 loaded tater skins and mac 'n cheese bites. For fried bar food, every item tasted unique and delicious. I believe that even the batter tasted different for the pickles, mushrooms and poppers. All this came on one platter with sour cream and salsa. My daughter and I asked for ranch on the side.   The pickled fries is thinly sliced. Best fried pickles I have ever had. The mushrooms were flavorful and juicy. Watch out, they are hot when they first come out. The zucchini slices were okay. I loved the jalapeno poppers, stuffed with a savory cream cheese. Yum! The loaded tater skins were great. Sadly, we only got 2. We like the tasty mac 'n cheese bites. They were yummy like mozzie sticks. Sadly, the nachos were poorly dressed. Half of our chips were naked, no cheese, jalapenos slices, olives, or onions. So, if you want nachos, get a separate order because their Daddy O. nachos is wonderful or it was the last time we came. I washed it all down with a pint of Deschutes beer on tap.   The ambiance was typical of a neighborhood bar. Our waitress was nice but forgot to fill up my daughter's water. If you want to come enjoy fried nosh with beer, drop by Daddy O.'s!"}
{"text":"Thank you so much!!! I hosted a going away party for a close friend last night with about 30 guests, and it was a great party! I spoke with numerous locations prior to making a decision for the party. I chose DaddyO's because Dave was so great and accommodating. Unlike other local bars I spoke with. Dave worked with me on all of my requests and reserved an area for my group. He also honored my request on specifically requesting to have Erica as our server for the evening based on my brother knowing her from previous experiences with her at a different location.   Erica was our server all night and she was amazing! I was Allowed my crazy decorations, Erica kept the cake for the guest of honor cold and brought it out when requested, Food was great, drinks were fast and cold, and she tolerated my drunk guests well!  It was just an overall great evening that will be remembered by all of us. We all had a blast!   Thank you Dave and Erica for a great night!!!  I can't express how happy I am with how the night turned out! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Love their sweet potato fries and chicken strips and the jalapeño cheese dip --- OMG a must try! The wait staff are all really nice! Prices are great too!"}
{"text":"Very pleased. Came in last Friday for the all you can eat fish. Fish was great and allot larger than I thought it would be. It seemed to be house made and tasted delicious so was the sause. Ayssa was my bartender I believe.  She was very nice, did a great job serving me and has a beautiful smile. May be back again just for the fish and Ayssa."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night for some birthday beers with my cousin and son. Bar wasn't full but not empty either. Staff was attentive and friendly. Even saw one appropriately handle a guest that was a bit annoying in my opinion. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town. Ladies at the bar (Tish & Alissa), you were great."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some dinner and a beer last Saturday.  If you've ever been to the Casey Jones bar it's in the same place.  De-core is the same minus the train that used to cruise around.  I thought the place looked cleaner then before.  I was shocked to see not a lot of people in the place though, what gives?  Beer and food were regular prices for bar food.  Food didn't shine, but hey it's a bar and it was good.  I thought it had plenty of tv's around for peeps to watch.  I'm more of a people watcher and would maybe come back for a band or karaoke or something another time."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast! I go with friends from work and for three of us bill is 30.00 for ten beers and three breakfast platters not too shabby! Staff is super Friendly and food is great!!"}
{"text":"Is there a way to leave a negative rating?  Several of us came back after swearing off this place because we were meeting with some friends.   One person was totally ignored by staff and had a waitress from a different side of the restaurant wait on her.  And we won't go into how they completely forgot my order and got served after my babygirl did..."}
{"text":"So my dad and I stopped in here about a week ago to kill some time. Hanging out with dad is a rare thing so I was having a good day but that was quickly ruined. We walked in and I was really excited to ask about paint night but I needed the ladies room first. I asked a gentleman who I now know is the owner Dave where it was and he directed me making a gesture to follow him. When we got to a certain point he stopped me and said I wasn't allowed in that section which was fine but then he looked at me and my cane and began blubbering. He said that he was recently sued and that this man took him for X amount of dollars and he wasn't even allowed to be where he was at that it is clearly marked. I left him talking to my dad but he made it sound like I was out for a meal ticket and that really disturbed me. I found him to be very rude in telling me to follow him and then insinuating that I was going to sue him like the other guy if I was to fall in that section. We did eat and the food was decent so that's why I gave them 2 stars but I will never be back to this place. I actually had to wait to write this review to calm myself down. I also found it very unprofessional that when I told the very nice waitress that I would be writing this review she begged me not to but like I said this has nothing to do with her or her performance she was great."}
{"text":"A few people mentioned in their reviews that this restaurant needs to work on getting the kinks out. Well, I went there last night and there is still a lot more work to be done. Granted, there was a large car show event going on in the shopping plaza where the restaurant is located, but since Daddy O's was one of the sponsors of the car show, they should have had their s*** together and hired some additional wait staff and kitchen staff (they could have hired temps for the evening) to make sure they were adequately staffed.  We were a large party and all of us ordered the All You Can Eat Fish Fry for $9.95. A friend of mine had gone the previous Friday night and had raved about the fish fry, so I was eager to try it. We sat down quite quickly and received our drinks in a timely manner. We waited almost 2 hours for our fish (asking the waitresses and manager several times when our food was going to arrive after it didn't arrive after 60 minutes). It never did arrive and we finally just got up and left. It was a very disappointing experience.  The manager was friendly and welcoming but did not seem to be helping the harried wait staff bring food to tables. Several people at other tables complained to the manager and his answer was, \"We're doing the best we can.\" Maybe this bar & grill should just concentrate on being a bar/pool hall and not offer food. The atmosphere was pleasant but the lack of service was appalling."}
{"text":"I was treated to breakfast after volunteering at Bountiful Baskets by the site coordinator this morning.  My meal was good (2 eggs, a slice of marble rye, potatoes, and 2 big slices of bacon).  The coffee was nice and hot too.  Perfect after a morning of working outside.  Thanks Janet."}
{"text":"Poor service!!!! Waitress was awful, didn't knew the prices on drinks didn't knew what was on tap, and was too busy talking to other people. She had blonde hair and a bunch of tattoos. Really bad experience first time there and will be the last one."}
{"text":"We went there the first week they opened...I think Feb 2012.  Like anyone, rough start. Been back many times since. The staff ALWAYS remembers us. The menu is way above the usual bar food.  Homemade everything. Fish is amazing. I am really picky and will only eat fish from The Windsor or Sun Up Brewery. Thank God I got a place by home for awesome fish.  Oh and the chicken tenders are homemade too...not from a bag. I love the crowd and the staff.  I'm not just a foodie but a beer snob too.  They have an eclectic beer selection and rotate 5 unique brews all the time."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my first time visiting This bar/grill will be my last. The service was far below my very lenient expectations, as I felt ignored by the server and belittled by the manager when I asked if the quality of service was standard there. But, of course, the restaurant was under a staffing \"Overhaul\" and by next week things would be tip-top. I won't be returning to find out."}
{"text":"My Family ate here last night 03/08/2012. The service here was better the the other reviews. But the food was NOT as I had hoped it would of been. It just did not have a lot of fl aver and kinda pricey. They don't have much of a menu selection I know they have only been open a few weeks so maybe they can learn to cook and hopefully expand there menu."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times and have been very pleased with the food. The breakfast dishes are just like homemade( if your a good cook that is, lol ). So far I've not had better food at any other pub n grill. Definately worth the time."}
{"text":"Really good!  Came from LA for the weekend and loved the food here... Recommend the burger"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a while. They've redecorated and it looks pretty dang nice in here. Service has been awesome and it's fish fry Friday and it's excellent excellent fish and it just keeps coming!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give Daddy-Os three stars, but the waitresses are incredibly kind, the breakfast is a smokin' deal, and the patio is beautiful.  The food is across the board--some great, some not. (Burgers and fries, yes. Chili, no.) The bathroom is tired, but always clean and stocked.  Good neighborhood place. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I remember this place when it was Casey Jones. It was shitty then. I came here a few months ago for a drink at night and found that the place was your typical North Phoenix sports bar, except clean and not divey. For me, it was really boring and I didn't love it.   However, I came here for lunch and beer with a friend the other day and was actually very surprised. I had no idea they served good food. They make almost everything in house, the ingredients are fresh and the sandwiches are really damn tasty. Decent quality bread as well.   My only gripe is that the balsamic vinaigrette tastes like straight balsamic and the side salad is really not good. It's not 1984- good things have happened since iceberg lettuce. I wonder what the deal is with that-  the bartender even warned me that it was bad, but I thought how can one mess up a balsamic vinaigrette? Equal parts EVOO and Balsamic vinegar  a little dijon, a little honey... deliciousness. Apparently, it can be messed up.  I am fixated on this, because the bartender insisted it was made with oil and it was in fact a salad dressing not straight BV... but it really tasted like it was straight BV. So, ok- it sucks then, but the sandwiches are really good and I will eat there again some time.  I give it 4 stars, because there are few places in the area that actually serve fresh food."}
{"text":"In just a few visits, I've become a fan of Daddy-O's and the food is solid for what looked from the outside to be just another so-so bar in a strip mall.   By the looks of it, the menu is your basic, small, Mom & Pop type affair.  Bar apps, sandwiches, burgers, etc. But look a bit deeper and you'll notice a nice selection of dinner entrees that are priced very well with touches not usually found in such a place.  Salads made with mixed greens, sauteed veggies for sides, garlic fries (which are excellent) as the house french fry. Lot's of good things going on here in the kitchen. The Grilled Pork Chops are well made, the Fish and Chips, the Club Sandwich, the Pastrami sandwich all are very good and worth trying out.  I've had a few minor glitches, but nothing tragic. The Nachos, which are enormous, weren't very hot and the Southwestern Potato Pancakes served with the pork chop were very salty.  Both issues were addressed and they even gave me a delicious baked potato to make up for the salty pancakes.  Service is good. We sit at the bar and they've started to notice we're regulars!   Give this place a try...I work in the restaurant business and I truly would love to see this place succeed.  Also, the Saturday Prime Rib special is a steal!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast and lunches here. They wait staff and bartenders are always friendly and the owner checks on everyone to make sure they are good.  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Last time we went in we had a very good waitress, my wife and I split a nachos that was very good. Music selection was definitely better this time around."}
{"text":"Decent burger... 1/2 lb charbroiled nice flavor. Mine was inconsistently cooked, so take that into consideration. Fries were good. Had some garlic parsley I think.  Service was better then it should've been 1 server/ bartender at 1pm. ,14 patrons... she did good. Ok"}
{"text":"I have frequented this establishment for some time, it is where my son and I go to watch football games religiously. I've come here many times with friends, the food is really good! The service HAS been really good for the most part. However, the common theme is the management doesn't seem to prepare well for large crowds. The servers were so busy that the wait was ridiculous. The manager was rude, the server abrupt, the order was wrong, drinks were slow. The saving grace was Dayna, the bartender, of which was suppose to be off but stayed to help, she made the best effort to help us, explain what and why the lack of service and then fixed the issues. She is the reason I will give it another opportunity to redeem itself, she was very kind and gracious and was working furiously to meet the needs of the patrons."}
{"text":"The first time we were here for dinner I had the mac & cheese which was tasty. My husband had a western burger which he raved about. The drinks were good and the service was good. The bad I ended up with food poisoning the next morning. The next time we went It took awhile for the server to come over. I ordered the bacon chedder burger loved the fries but half the burger was well done and the other half was pink (yuck) my husband ordered the western again and it was cooked the same way as mine. Over all I think I would have given it 2.5 stars as I would go back and try again."}
{"text":"1st time here. Food menu looks appetizing but did not select anu food items. Beer drafts come nice and ice cold with little head.  Bartender very nice and very well balanced with her duties. Nice place for a relaxing drink or two."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Good food, great service the nachos are amazing. Dana is my favorite waitress she always has a wonderful smile on her face and she is very attentive!! Reasonable drink prices!!"}
{"text":"Food was great but service was absolutely terrible. Walked in waiting, unsure if we were supposed to seat ourselves and watched 3 diff. ppl walk past without any acknowledgement. Seated ourselves after letting the bartender know where we were sitting. 25 minutes later we had to go back to the bar and ask for a drink and waitress even though 2 of them blew us off to serve the guy behind us, ignoring us completely. After ordering (no apology for the wait even), she decided to take a smoke break and rearrange tables before even putting in our order. Get a clue!"}
{"text":"This place is a little on the skeazy side. I've been here a couple of times and I always feel like there might be a little bit of dried something on the ripped plastic seat from someone who had a couple too many. Also, the music is too loud. I like music, but when it's loud enough that you have to yell at your date, and there's a sonic echo ripple across the top of your beer, that's too loud. I wish the menu was better, and the place less worn looking and the bartender a little friendlier looking and the waitresses not so overworked looking. Otherwise, it would get a better rating."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to come to this place when it was called Casey Jones, I'm not sure what changed as far as ownership goes, but it feels pretty much like the same old place. Decent bar food and an atmosphere that isn't too much of a \"bar\"  The food was alright, prices were alright, service was alright. Can't say anything bad but I wasn't overly impressed by any particular aspect. I wish they had some better specials though.  I would probably stop in again, it's a place you can take the kids if you need to."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night to have drinks were OK but the customer service was super super slow we went to the bar to order drinks because it was taking so long when we sat down with our drinks the waitress canceled our previous order making us wait double the time for next-door of drinks., just took forever"}
{"text":"We stopped by Daddy-O's for lunch today at 12pm.  We seated ourselves and noticed there was only one person working in the dining area and bar.  The server not only was taking care of 23 dining customers and six patrons at the bar.  Needless to say service was super slow.  The poor server/bartender was doing her best to keep up with all the work - the super slow service was not her fault.  Finally we got to order and after a very long time my burger and my wife's fried fish sandwich arrived. The fish sandwich had no sauce on it and the sweet potato fries were cold and soggy.  My burger was \"thrown\" together and also cold.  Our poor server kept apologizing for the service.  We did not skimp on her tip, but we won't be coming back again.  This is all the fault of the management."}
{"text":"Terrible service - terrible food - worst waitress ever in my life - orders wrong - waitied over an hour - seated by no one - had to go find the menus ourselves - $53 for food that we waited an hour for, which was not edible - NEVER again."}
{"text":"I am actually shocked by these reviews! The food is good, very cheap prices, and a great atmosphere. We have had a few slower servers, but now we always just ask for Alex. She is the best. Definitely going to miss our Football Sundays there!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and avocado sandwich with garlic fries. The chicken and avocado was a bit plain but the garlic fries were awesome. I was there at a time where there weren't many customers so i enjoyed the environment. The bar person is very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Went here early on Sunday to watch football. We sat at the bar to get a good view of the TV. Plenty of TVs and all the games were on. It got busy really quick and there were not enough servers to work all the tables. Besides that, the food was great and the drinks weren't over priced. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Gave this place a shot when the kitchen to my regular hangout was closed ...and I'm SO GLAD I DID!  The food here is amazing!   The fish tacos are out of this world...(fish is super crispy and the baja cream sauce is to die for) definitely best I've had in Phoenix : )    Their wings, shrimp, soups and sandwiches are just as delish!    Love coming here for drinks on Friday/Saturday nights.  Jukebox in the main room Karaoke in another... I prefer listening to music in the main room... Bartenders are pretty awesome!     This place is a gem.  Wrote this review because the other ones are Waaaay Off : )"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the first time today and was highly disappointed. I sat at the bar and waited 5-10 minutes alone to even be acknowledged. Once the order was taken the soda I got was completely out of sprite so all I got was the carbonated water and the other beverage was overfilled so it spilled on tge bar, then the bartender walked away without even taking the cash that I had in my hand. All this was with 9 lyrics 2 tables seated. I don't know how it is during rush hour but I was not pleased."}
{"text":"This place offers a super cheap-o breakfast, so being a broke single parent, I invite my folks out to eat. We sat down and got some really bad coffee, we order the 2.99 deal and waited a very long time. There were only 2 other tables so an excuse of being to busy was not an option. The cook was REALLY busy watching t.v. Behind the bar though.  So along with our 3 cheap -o meals I ordered a small pancake, when the food came out the pancakes didn't AND the food was cold and gross. Eggs were dry, potatos were dry and the toast was not buttered. To top it off there was no seasoning. None. How the eff do you screw up breakfast? We said something to the waitress about the missing pancakes and she just informed me it would just \"not be on the bill\" no offer to actually make them, and not even offering a sorry. After the awful expierence at this place I actually go out of my way and tell others how bad it is and to not EVER waste your time eating there. Thanks Daddy o's, but not thanks."}
{"text":"Service was not the best. Do not plan on coming back here. They have these signs that are to raise the flag when you need service and so I would and they literally took forever to come to the table. Just all around bad experience here"}
{"text":"I was looking for a local greasy spoon kind of place and after having dinner here thought it would be great for breakfast.  The service was terrible.  It took about 10 minutes to get menus, another 10 for kids menus and another 10 for drinks.  The food was okay... But not great.  The last straw was the bathroom... Yuck!  It looked like a service area!  Black dirt everywhere.  Even the trash can was covered in black dirt.  Definitely fun to people watch the \"morning afters\" but not worth risking my own health.  Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I don't really know how I can review this bar without using expletives, but for your tender eyes, Yelpers, I'll try.  First of all-- this place isn't Casey Jones which, in my opinion, is a shame. Casey Jones used to be that awesome neighborhood bar you'd walk into, order some good, cheap, and stiff drinks, and watch the fights. Shoot, you could watch the fights, you could play pool, you could watch any game you wanted to, and the waitresses were prompt and knew their drinks.  My boyfriend and I went last night to Daddy-O's (UFC fight night, btw), and guess what? Half the TVs weren't on, and of course they were NOT showing the fights. When we asked the lady behind the bar about the fights, she just shrugged at us. (ok...??)  Needless to say, Daddy-O's was dead, except for maybe a handful of people (including us). Hmmm... maybe TURN ON SOME TVs??? You don't have to play the fights if you're too cheap to pay for it, but for God's sake, at least play the Olympics! Come on!  On to the drinks-- ha, what a joke. The waitresses don't even know what drinks they have, our girl didn't even know what a \"Washington Apple shooter\" was... so... yeah. No drink specials at all.  We've gone on a Saturday and also one another time during Happy Hour, and both times they weren't doing ANY drink specials. Hmm.. again... maybe to drive in business, you should have drink specials?? Go figure! (Maybe I should run this bar.)  Long story short: We'll never be back, which is a shame, because it's right around the corner from our house and USED to be amazing. But no games, no good vibes, no drink specials... you can do better at places down the road!"}
{"text":"Went in with my husband on a Tuesday around 7 after a long day of shopping and we were famished. It had been 115 that day and we were quite parched as well. We seat ourselves at a booth in the bar area and wait to be greeted. A young lady walks up a few minutes later and drops menus and walks off without saying a word. Okay....strike one. Well after I watch her take an order at another table and input it in the computer she finally heads back to our table and says \"Ready?\" No hello, no how's it going, no introduction. Don't get me wrong, I get that this isn't Fleming's but give me a break. My husband asks her what kind of beers they have on draft and the girl literally points to the taps and says \"they're right there\" as she  rolls her eyes. Wow...strike 2. He reluctantly orders a blue moon and I order an iced tea and tell her we need more time to decide on food.  Minutes go by...no drinks. We watch her walk about the restaurant checking on other tables, put another order in, sip on her drink in the server station...etc. We have now been here for 15 minutes and have received nothing.    Yes...Finally! She's coming back to our table! But wait...She is empty handed! Nooooo! I'm so thirsty!!! \"The bartender is changing the blue moon keg so it'll be a minute\" she says and then turns around and walks away. Now I've been a bartender/server for 15 years. When bar drinks are going to take a minute I bring the non alcoholic bevs out along with a water for the guest who ordered the bar drink. I also know it doesn't take 15 minutes to change a keg...not to mention we can see the bartender still behind the bar talking to her bar guests. We wait another 5 minutes...the bartender is still talking to her bar guest and our server is on her phone in the server station and it's now been 20 minutes and we don't even have water. Strike 3, we're out. Neither the bartender or our server acknowledge us as we stand up and walk out never to return. It's a shame because we recently moved to the area and are looking for a new place to spend our Sundays during football season. This will not be it."}
{"text":"Tonight this placed sucked ...the place was packed and the bar tinder sucked. .we had to ask over and over just to get a drink, they didn't have enough menus...they were not friendly at all...on a Saturday night you should have a lot more waitress and maybe try having a bar tinder that knows how to serve people"}
{"text":"Went for Breakfast. Bloody Mary's were great, food was good and plenty. Clean. A little pricey for a sports bar."}
{"text":"The beer is $4.00 a pint for Blue Moon. The BBQ Chicken was minced (mushy) and just barely warm. The BBQ sauce had more flavor and was cold. The sweet potato fries were almost burnt on the outside and mush on the inside. Flavorless.  The Build You Own burger was greasy and they charged for a slice of Swiss cheese. I thought build your own would include one slice of cheese.  I may go back but I will not order the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"How do you mess up a chicken avocado sandwich?  If you want to find out, order it here.   Absolutely no flavor and  very tough pice of chicken.  Waiter for a while for server to ask how the food was, never happened.  At the end, didn't care, will never be returning here again."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  It was 9 p.m. on a Friday night and I just finished shopping in the area so I stopped by knowing they would be open later than most restaurants.  Seat yourself the sign said and so I did.  The first waitress looked cranky but she got a menu for me.  My waitress seemed nice.  I ordered the fish, shrimp and chips.  Food came out fast but it was a disappointment.  Fish and shrimp were flavorless and over-fried.  The waitress forgot my extra Tartar.  Some where along the way my waitress forgot I existed.  When she stopped by to check on me, I asked for my check.  I got it - put my Visa inside for payment - and she never came back.  Another waitress cleared my plate because I was clearly done.  Every time my waitress came out on the floor I tried to get her attention by motioning and calling to her.  She never, ever looked my way.  Finally after a very long time.  I walked up the the waitress area next to the kitchen and I said I really need to leave and you have forgotten about me - here's my Visa.  She brought the check over for me to sign but then she said she never forgot about me which bothered me because she did.  No reason to ever stop there except for convenience - now no reason to stop all all because slow is not convenient."}
{"text":"Spinach Artichoke dip for appetizer was amazing, my friend and l both had the Reuben on marbled rye it was delicious and the fries were excellent l didn't even put salt and pepper on them they were perfect without adding anything. Place was very clean and business was steady during Sunday lunch. I asked for the Blackhawks game to be put on where we were sitting and my server was able to accommodate us which meant a lot to me!  They also had a ton of t.v.'s with different sports on so l will definitely be coming back during football season. Also had pool tables darts and seating at the bar and dining room."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night at 1am. Music wasn't that loud, and the seats were 90% empty.   Waaaay back in my early Yelp days, I had reviewed this establishment under previous ownership. In a past life, this bar would have been PACKED, and had a really cool clientele. Sure, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is still cool, but the crowd had been reduced to a row of lonely looking women just pecking away at their phones waiting for something to happen that never does.  The net cafe around the corner seemed to house more excitement. Daddy O's was THAT boring."}
{"text":"Amazing service! We brought in our grandson and Dana, Michael and the owner Dave hooked us up. The Spicy Mac-n-Cheese along with Jalapeño Poppers are the bomb. Add a Turkey Avocado Sandwich along with a great Southwestern Buffalo Chicken Wrap and you are in for a culinary delight."}
{"text":"This place used to be Casey Jones. When we started going here 5 years ago the food was great, the service was great and I wouldn't hesitate to take my kids in for a late afternoon dinner.   Then it began to get a bit shady. Fights were a normal thing here.  I am hoping with new management and rebranding it will be able to recover.  The food was ok, service was slow but tolerable, it appeared that they were just taking over so some kinks were to be expected. All in all I will certainly go back soon and try them again and hopefully get the chance to update my review."}
{"text":"This was hands down, the WORST restaurant/bar I've been to. As soon as we walked in the door we stood there waiting to be seated and the place wasn't even busy. We were finally seated and placed our orders and patiently waiting for our food. I ordered the French dip, which was alright, while my fiancé ordered the all you can eat fish Friday. After finishing his first 2 pieces of fried fish it took about 15 mins for the next round. According to the server they had run out of fish... (On fish Friday!?!) once his fish came, it was extremely greasy! Not to mention, when we asked about how long it would take for his second 2 pieces of fish she swore at us about the cooks while walking away. Long story short our bill was $42. We were told we got a 20% discount for the terrible service when only $3 had been taken off. After questioning it and then speaking to the manager he told us 20% had in deed been taken off plus $5 extra. When in fact he had only taken off the $3 (20% according to him) plus $5.   Overall, I feel like we were scammed and we received really terrible service. I couldn't believe the waitress threw down the f-bomb!"}
{"text":"I came here the other day with my boyfriend and his dad. We just moved to the area and saw this place and decided to try it out. My boyfriend saw the reviews on Yelp but his dad convinced him to give it a try. We walked in and sat down immediately and was approached by a very nice waitress. There was no one else at the time eating at the restaurant which kind of got me worried.   Anyways, I ordered chicken caesar wrap with French fries and it came out delicious!! It was very filling and I loved the fries. My boyfriend got the burger with fries and he said it was good. His dad I believe got the Ruben sand which. We all enjoyed the meal and the waitress was very attentive on our drinks as well.  I am kind of surprised to see this restaurant get a low rating. But in my opinion this place deserves 5 stars for the friendly customer service and great food!! They also have TVs that you can watch while you eat your meals which was a huge plus. I will be coming back to this place again and I look forward to it."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick breakfast with my wife before work. The giant banner advertising their breakfast caught our eyes so we headed over instead of getting Starbucks.    We seated ourselves and raised the flag. It was a slow morning as there weren't many people inside. I ordered their breakfast burrito with the sausage gravy. It was flavorful and huge. At first I thought the addition of gravy was strange but it proved to be a very delicious topper.  My wife had the strawberry french toast. It looked and tasted like candy. It was very good. Sharing the two meals made for a nice mixture of salt and sweet.  While this wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast,  I wouldn't hesitate to come again if I want a cheap fast breakfast."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to come and have bite to eat and grab a beer.  Great food, great service (thank you, Amber) and great jukebox!  Plus the pinball and darts keep me occupied.  The establishment is clean and everyone is happy to see you."}
{"text":"Daddy O's is located right off Thunderbird and 43rd Ave within the shopping center.  Food;  The breakfast is really good - the eggs were cooked to order, bacon crisp.  Service;  The servers are always nice and helpful, sometimes during the day its limited on help so be patient they are working their butt off."}
{"text":"Had the 3.99 bfast it was delicious and you can't beat the price ! The hubcap pancakes are delicious to !"}
{"text":"I went here on 12/13/14 around 1pm and wanted a late breakfast, however on saturdays they stop serving breakfast that late. So I decided to just go with lunch. We ordered the Pretzel bites that was said to come with a spicy jalapeno cheese dip....which ended up being the creamy spinach dip? I think they need to update their menu because that was very misleading. The food was alright, not bad, not great. The service however left something to be desired. It feels as though they treat their regualrs really well and the newbies have to get hazed with bad service.  I wont waste my time on this place again."}
{"text":"Would have been 2 stars but the all you can eat fish fry on Friday saved them a star. Service was OK, but the place just has the wrong vibe. Hard to explain.  Maybe if they added some decent Happy Hour food and drink specials I'd be back, but until then, its not really on my list of places to frequent.  BTW- one of the draws here is a classic car show every Saturday night. If you're into that kinda thing, then you most likely already know, but for those who don't, you may want to stop in for that."}
{"text":"Good service, fun and competent waitstaff, they know how to make an old fashioned,  and they have karaoke on Friday nights. The drinks are good,  they bring water when you ask for it,  and you don't wait all night for your order. There's room to dance when a good song comes on, too! I haven't tried the food yet,  but everything else is good!"}
{"text":"So this USED to be a fun little place to stop in and grab a drink and some really good food when I was on the west side of the Black Cnyn Frwy. Stopped in this morning 'cause I remembered they served breakfast. What a joke. The staff could have cared less that a customer walked in. They were too busy doing setup and talking about the fun they had the night before. When a waitress did come over, I asked if they were still serving breakfast. Blank look. Looked at the menu. Confused look. \"Um let me find out\". Walked away. Disappeared. Another waitress comes up same question. Same confused reaction. At this point I am questioning whether these girls even work at this joint and if they don't know if the kitchen is cooking breakfast, I'll take my chances somewhere else, pick my stuff up and leave.  Sorry Daddy-O's hire some competent staff."}
{"text":"Wife and I sat down and waited apporx 10 min for someone to look at us, finally got someones attention and ordered a beer while we looked at the menu. 33 minutes accordig to my timer they finally brought our beer out as we were leaving. Ive seen snails perform faster ...."}
{"text":"I originally complained about this place a few months ago and the manager actually contacted me.  He offered to buy my next meal along with some other perks and I told him I would prefer he feed a homeless vet which he did.  I have since been back several times and had great service.  My only recommendation is to get there early on Sunday's because it gets packed quick!"}
{"text":"Such a fun little Dive Bar it's in the corner of a strip mall on 43rd Avenue and Thunderbird me and my husband thought that we would come and enjoy the evening on a Friday night Great Value all-you-can-eat fish fry for 999. Unfortunately they bring out one piece at a time therefore you have to be there for at least five hours in order to get 5 pieces of fish considering how busy it was. As far as the fish it was Def good heart taste , but once again it's the slow ordering of the fish that's really a pain in the a**., however the Coronas are $3 all day everyday so I guess if you're waiting for this there's nothing better to do than drinking an ice-cold $3 Corona! I'll come back one more time if the service is the same I probably won't return"}
{"text":"I live so close to this place and my bf loves it. However he has no sense of smell... really, he doesn't. So let me say that often times in here it smells musty, unfresh as if there may be a plumbing/ sewer issue and could use a good scrub down. That being said, food here is great. Friendly servers and bartenders. Kitchen closes at midnight. We like coming here for NFL Sundays and just because. A chill local joint, worth checking out for good food and cheap drinks. They let folks vape at the bar... while its not my thing, I'm just saying for those who might care. Darts, pool, etc..."}
{"text":"Very very poor service again. I met my son and his girlfriend here last night and waited a long time to be served. It was dinner time and 35 min later no waitress around. Paid for my beer and sons beer and left. We went to Pullanos down the street and spent my 80.00 including tip which is what I would have spent here. Never again,Pullanos took great care of us. Next time its Pullanos."}
{"text":"Bartender had the worst attitude I have ever seen!! Been here for 30 min and still don't have a drink or a menu ? Hopefully I will never  be invited to come here again. Must be a Bernie sanders supporter that thinks they deserve $ 15 an hour for not doing her job!"}
{"text":"My wife..... If you read my reviews you will probably see this often as she will suggest a place one or her friends has visited.  The decor? This is a typical sports bar that has opened in the morning to serve breakfast.  We got there early and when we were seated i checked Yelp for reviews. Reviews were not so good. But they all seamed to be from afternoon, night hours. I can't talk to what may happen in the afternoons. But the breakfast was very good and inexpensive. The service was good. As long as we set there they served us coffee. No rush.  If you want a good inexpensive  breakfast? Go see them,"}
