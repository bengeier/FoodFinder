{"text":"We ordered Spicy BBQ and LemonPepper wings with fries and an order of onion rings from here. The wait was a little long but that is because everything is made to order and fresh. They don't have those small itsy bitsy chicken wings these wings were saucy big covered in this spicy BBQ love fries crispy onion rings crispy and the lemon pepper wings didn't have my face squinched up like some others GREAT choice! Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place I've gone on several different occasions and tried different menu items and each time it was a huge disappointment I support black businesses but this place is just a no for me now the lemonade they make is delicious but wasn't impress with anything else and parking is terrible because of the busy shopping center I do like that they give student discounts to the schools in the area has a very kind gesture customer service is always friendly. I would say just go and true it out for yourself you may just like it"}
{"text":"We were waiting for someone at the barber shop and decided to try them since they were new. The prices are really good. I ordered a hot dog meal, 2 wing combos, and and a chicken wrap. Everything turned out good. The chicken wrap wasn't just the regular cold wrap. It was looked really good and my boyfriend said it taste really good too. I enjoyed my wings."}
