{"text":"During the late commute back home when they usually don't operate the 42 bus to Middlefield, I usually stop by Kennedy to either take ten or so minutes to walk back home or call someone to pick me up, I often see this restaurant passing by but never had been there at all.

So one night after getting drunk with my friends downtown, I decided to give this a try. The fact that this restaurant closes at 4 am was somewhat a lifesaver considering I am in need of eating something decent. The restaurant to my surprise isn't really that seedy considering 24 hr/late night establishments often is and the two girls working there are quite cute especially the tall one.

The menu is Northern Chinese Cuisine and seeing the extensive filled with things that I am somewhat familiar with to odd foods that I had seen on my trip to China, I ordered the sweet & sour pork and rice instead. And to my surprise, for the late night establishment, the food was not bad and the sweet and sour pork was too sweet but the rice did save the consistency. 

Anyways, the problem is the service and since I don't speak Mandarin, I was somewhat screwed trying to order beer through a server's broken English. It befuzzles me even further that I wanted to order a Canadian but she could not understand what I am talking about yet after talking to other servers about their beer selection, she brought a Canadian (or a Molson but w/e). What surprises me is that she brought it to me in a large coffee cup and kept on saying \"bottled water\" (or something idk really understand broken English well) and that its \"3.50\". I guess they were not LLBO approved or something, the previous reviewer hinted that theres beer but what I got was a beer in a damn coffee cup. I was too annoyed to post a picture.

They also have wifi too and bubble tea which is expensive and decent..."}

Wushan/Chongqing Grilled Fish(Pepper Spicy/$24.99)

----The concept of this Northern Chinese dish is simple 2-Fold*.
     First, Grill the Fish. Secondly, Stew in choice of spicy ingredients.
     Arrives to table on a Hotelpan that's heated underneath a la Hotpot.

     Add choice of Toppings($1.00) where I like to add Glass Noodles and Veg.
     The whole visual aspect is stunning feast-for-your-eyes presentation.
     Both times, I chose Live Catfish which stands best to longterm cooking.

     Definitely spicy, probably because I'm not adapt to Northern spicy yet.
     The sauce is extremely flavoured which is nice to begin with but...
     Unfortunate gets quite salty! as it condenses over the open-flame.
     I could not have too much either as I feel it's cholesterol loaded.

     At the end, some good some bad, some UGLY[Catfish].     

*Actually 3-Fold according to Wushan Methods[Marinade, Grill, Stew]

Hot and Sour Rice Noodles($4.99)

----I somewhat remember it being the Flat version of Glass Noodles
     Chewy Noodles with an initial Sourness then Spicy red Soup kicks in.
     I've always wanted to try this however wish more Toppings existed.

Last but not least....

The Restaurant is not the most pleasant to stay-awhile.
Washrooms should be avoided when possible, trust me.
Another Yelper managed to re-adjust their Booth seats.

Other places serve the Wushan/Chongqing Grilled Fish too.
The factor is that it may cost more and Catfish may not be offered.
I will let you decide what serves you best, Decor or Cost."}
{"text":"great grilled fish in soup base of your choice! authentic indeed! we'd been to southern china where it became popular in recent years- with that said, we would've given it a five if not b/c the washroom gross..."}
{"text":"Tasty & Tasty is a restaurant that serves Northern Chinese Food just open at the corner of McNicoll and Kennedy. 

BBQ of any part of a sheep..includes Sheep Balls (yes not meat balls, the real thing), Cow Blood Vessels  can be find on their extensive menu.

But we are here this evening for their grilled whole fish ($24.99) cooked in our broth of choice, and of course for me always the spiciest version of Peppercorn flavour. Here you got to pick the fish, we settled on the cat fish and what kind of sides we want as there are quite selections to choose from for $1 each.

My DC really enjoyed the fish, which has a firm texture and not fishy at all but instead has a hint of sweetness. The  veggie and vermicelli noodles soaked up all the spicy broth and is delicious. Just be really careful with the zillions of peppercorns in the broth, unless of course you enjoy the numbness those little thing can cause to inside of your mouth!

Eating here at Tasty & Tasty is just like eating at a friend's house back in University. Nothing is formal, a little chaotic but is hard to be upset at our lovely waitress. Our seats at the booth even fell apart..as it is not even attached to the wooden base. 

Btw, they were out of beers!! I think the fish would have taste so much better with some iced cold beer...not one of those slush, soda, yogurt and bubble tea drinks they also serves!

Tasty & Tasty only opens from 4:00 pm to 5:00 am so if you are in the area and a urge for late night food, give them a try!!"}
