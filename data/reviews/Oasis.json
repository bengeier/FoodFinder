{"text":"The first time I went to Oasis I had the oxtail and a side of fresh salad. It was delicious and I'll definitely be back for more. The oxtail had lots of meat on it and was perfectly cooked. The place itself is cute and cozy with a 'ma and pa' type feel to it, which I prefer. So if you are looking for home-cooked Jamaican style dishes, it's worth checking out. The owner is lovely, she is super sweet and charming. Oh and yes, her  home-made hot sauce is bomb."}
{"text":"Nice, clean place. New, so they're still tweaking the menu. Beer tenders are a lot of fun. Wings are large compared to most bar food. Daily specials and not crowded (fast service!). Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"The menu is short, but has enough choices for everything from a snack to a full meal.  All home-cooked and delicious. The owner is charming, her restaurant is simple and hospitable. 

My companion requested  the hottest sauce for his roti, she explained that her hottest sauce is VERY hot because she makes it herself from scotch bonnet peppers with the seeds left in. He said he liked very hot, so she served it on the side. (He declared it wonderful, and asked for a second helping! So it you like fiery sauces, try it.) I had the jerk chicken plate and fried plantains, which we dipped in some of the hot sauce. M'mmmm!

I recommend Oasis for inexpensive, beautifully cooked food in a relaxed setting."}
{"text":"So I have mix reviews about this place. The place is clean, the drinks are cheap and the food is okay but the service is HORRIBLE the bartender are slow, bad attitude, and very rude. I won't be going back I prefer good service over everything else so if that mean I have to pay more for better service I have no problem doing so. If you are looking for cheat and bad service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My fiance and I stopped here to grab something quick for dinner after a few days of vacation.  The owner was a sweetheart and made some really good homemade Jamaican food.  We had a Jamaican beef patty, and a roti.  Everything was delicious, although we could have used some more heat in the roti."}
{"text":"Hit this place after work mainly to get a bite to eat. Unfortunately kitchen can be a bit slow. The good news is the price you would pay at another bars happy hour for food specials lasts all day here. This works for me and my hours. Food is not bad either, some things better than others.Could use a little more menu variety ,e.g. soups. Has at least ten beers on tap at fair prices. Bar maids actually are friendly and talk to you. All in all this places works for me and I keep going back."}
