{"text":"COFFEE SHOP PRIME RIB AT BEST. I live in Vegas. I made reservations for Christmas Dinner.  We both had PRIME RIB. It was bland and tough. Way overpriced.  Don't bother going upstairs  to this place. Make a left to the cafe and save your money."}
{"text":"I'm a veggie and visited this place after the previous night at \"Lawry's Prime Rib\".  The person that paid for this meal thought this was a more reasonable price for similar quality meat.  As a veggie, the veggie preparation (seasoning and cooking) was not as good as the preparation of veggies at Lawry's, but the raw ingredients were MUCH better (for Las Vegas.)  The next time we are in Las Vegas, we will choose to visit here instead of Lawry's Prime Rib."}
{"text":"Good Value for prime rib and tasty too!"}
{"text":"Hello all, When reviewing restaurants I use a rating system that looks at all aspects of their Menu, Decor, Food, Service & Price. A restaurant can score up to 5 points per category and a perfect score would be 25 points.  Menu:  2 Stars: The menu was available online which I really like and it was presented in a clean and easy to read format.  I am giving a low score here because I got turned off when I saw  a vegetable tempura app on the menu of a fine dining steakhouse.  Typically I like concise menus, however this menu was lacking options. Decor:  4 Stars: I found the decor and ambiance of the restaurant tomb fantastic.  I really liked the look and style, it blended well with their concept. Food:  2.5 Stars: Average is all I can say about the food here.  The appetizer I selected for the table was a crab stuffed mushroom which was deep fried and served on a plate with 3 different sauces, 2 on the plate for garnish and one for dipping.  I would not order this again. My salad was terrible, I am still not sure how a fine dining steakhouse can mess up a house salad and as for my entree the only thing I liked about my steak was it's size.  Although after I cut off all the fat there wasn't much meat left.  Did not get dessert as the choices were less then impressive. Service: 3 Stars: I liked the fact that bottled Voss water is flowing like champagne at at a wedding at no extra charge.  The wait staff was efficient but not that which you would typically see in a fancy steakhouse.  I asked about the daily specials and for a dinner recommendation and was not impressed by their knowledge and delivery. Price: 3 Stars: I would say the average entree was $25, a little high for the location and quality but not outrageous.  Overall dinner was about $40 per person with tax & tip.  My overall rating, 14.5 of 25 lands this place 2 Stars, as I would not return here nor would I recommend it.    ~Signed, Las Vegas Yelper 1116"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently stayed at the Orleans, Apr. 16-20.  We decided that we would have dinner one night at the Prime Rib Loft.  In all the years that we've stayed at the Orleans, we never made it to the Loft and this time we decided to do it.  In a nutshell, it was just outstanding!    From the moment we walked in, I knew I was going to like it.  Very nice atmosphere for a good, relaxing dinner.  Our waiter, Daniel, was just awesome.  He was very helpful, paced the diner well, never rushed us.  Daniel told us he had been working at the Loft for only 5 weeks, but his experience spoke otherwise.  I would recommend Daniel in a heartbeat!    We started out by sharing an appetizer of shrimp cocktail.  It was a plate of about six very nice sized shrimp with an interesting sauce.  It was homemade cocktail sauce with some hot mustard drizzled on the top and on the plate.  I absolutely loved it; then again, I haven't really met a shrimp I didn't like!  For the main course, my husband ordered the sea bass; since I'm basically a carnivore (!), I had to have my prime rib.  I had the small cut.  My husband absolutely loved his sea bass, and the size of the fish was a very generous portion.  My prime rib was extremely flavorful and so tender (I always order mine medium rare) that I really didn't need the knife.  For my side, I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes and there was a generous amount of garlic in them.  It didn't overpower the potatoes at all.  Then again, I'm a garlic lover and there really isn't any such thing as too much garlic!    Who I presume to be the manager came over to our table.  Unfortunately, I don't remember her name, but she was extremely friendly.  We told her we chose the Loft because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.  A few minutes later, Daniel came over with a complimentary dessert that was just out of this world!  My husband, who rarely eats chocolate and even more rarely has dessert, ate quite a bit which says something.  It was almost a \"death by chocolate\" cake - the cake itself was chocolate, the inside and top was covered with layers of chocolate, and the back side of the slice had shaved chocolate.  If that wasn't enough, it was drizzled with fresh raspberry sauce, and there were several fresh raspberries and blackberries (my personal favorite) on the plate.  It was by far, hands down, the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten.    Also with dinner, my husband ordered a bottle of wine for us.  Ordering wine is a little bit of a challenge as he likes sweeter whites and I lean toward the dry reds.  We compromised and ordered a bottle of Mc Murray Ranch Pinot Noir, and it was just wonderful.  It went well with both of our dinners.    All in all, I definitely recommend the Prime Rib Loft if you're looking for a quite, relaxing, top notch dinner.  I can't say enough about Daniel - he did an outstanding job.  When we go back, hopefully he'll be there because I definitely want him as our waiter.  The Prime Rib Loft is very reasonably priced; and the food is fresh and very flavorful.  This place really is very underrated and people truly don't know what they're missing.    My rating is really 4.5.  One thing bothered me and while this may be just a personal preference of mine, I wonder if other people are bothered by this as well.  The dress code at the Loft is basically business casual.  While we were there, we saw two different parties, one party being mostly male, that walked in with T-shirts and baseball caps, some turned backwards.  Really?  While I understand that the dress code is not formal, considering the ambiance, service, food, wine selection, etc., that one is getting and paying for, I think a little more respect should be shown.  If I wanted to see t-shirts and baseball caps, I could have dined at an outdoor cafe or bar!  I really would like to see management change the dress code so that t-shirts and baseball caps are not allowed.    All in all, a truly wonderful dinner and we'll be back to dine again.  Keep up the GREAT work, Prime Rib Loft, and hope to see you very soon!"}
{"text":"Pros - very food prime rib and surprisingly inexpensive Cons - Presentation, ambiance, sides  I enjoyed this place. Sure there were a lot of negatives interior is dated, appetizers, mash potatos and sides are so-so, but the service is solid, prime rib is very good (4 - 4 1/2 *'s) and the price outstanding.   Appetizer We started with the crab stuffed mushroom caps - don't order them. Crab tastes frozen or canned. Not good for $12  Salad Cesars Salad - nothing spectacular but it was good. I enjoyed it.  Dinner Prime rib - Excellent.  (4-4 1/2 *'s) If I had gotten it rare as ordered instead of medium rare, I would have probably given it 5 *'s.  Mashed potatoes - so-so  Sides Asparagus - good Creamed corn - good but a little sweet  No dessert - too full at end of meal  Price - I chuckled when I received the bill. It was much, much cheapr than expected. Only $100 for 5 (86 yo MIL and 93 yo aunt split a meal - no split charge)  also included generous 8 oz 'glass' of  wine for me.  The overall dining experience is 3 *'s - there were a fair amount of negatives but service and the prime rib are excellent and considering the price I gave it 4's  I'll be back"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I went here because I love prime rib and we heard this was the place to go. Thank goodness we had a $50 gift card because it wasn't worth the money. The service was great. I wish the food was the same. We started out with shaved onion loaf, which was good, then I ordered 22 oz. prime rib (med rare) and my boyfriend ordered the lamb chops. My prime rib was very dry and over cooked and the lamb chops were also dry. We didn't care to order desert. So all in all, I definitely wouldn't recommend this place. If it's the price you're going for, I would suggest spending the extra dollars for better food."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and a really nice (yet casual) place for steak/prime rib.  Really had a craving for some good ole prime rib. Asked around and searched the net..,  decided this was a very good bet.our party of four was just completely satisfied.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great evening. Food was excellent the service was great can't wait to come back again. I have been here several times before and it's always great to take friends here because you never get anything but great compliments. If you're looking for prime rib this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Long time fan of this restaurant and the unsurpassed, immaculate guest service from Jose Fernando!  My fiancé and I have been dining here for at least 5 years now and every time has been fantastic!  Our server knows what we want, and often brings us our beer upon greet!  9/10 times we have a reservation, and 9/10 times we are a little late, but they are ALWAYS accommodating. (Sometimes I even make the reservation for 30 mins later than what I tell my fiancé so we can be on time!).  This place is a gem, and do drive out of your way from the strip to indulge in te BEST prime rib you've ever had. The prices are unbelievably low for such great quality of food and service. Please don't increase though!!! The place is clean, never has dirty forgotten tables, hostess (usually a manager) is quick to acknowledge and smile at us- welcoming us back and thanking us for dining, food is always hot and bursting with flavor and timing is always perfect. Everything and anything you would want from a restaurant is HERE! Jose Fernando, my hats off to you, cannot wait to see you again and write another review!  Ask for him when you decide to dine, you will not be disappointed!  Although, the place is ran with great pride and love, and I am sure any server will be great!  Jose Fernando- WE LOVE YOU! These words I have written, are not easily handed out from me!  I run a profitable fine dining restaurant, and only hope my place is as good as this!  Keep up the great work!!! Your devoted patrons, Andrea and Steve Steele."}
{"text":"A reasonably priced, quality restaurant with nice ambiance and cozy booths at a property where you don't have to pay for parking!  The prime rib comes in a variety of sizes, swimming in au jus and delicious.  You can get a decent bottle of wine for just $20 and the service is terrific.  If you include the wine value, this experience is only a little more expensive than a buffet for a much nicer experience."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Vegas! We always eat at the big expensive casino restaurants like the Venetian, Wynn, Caesars, etc. They're good but honestly the Prime Rib Loft rivals them and is more affordable. The restaurant is more old school Vegas, which is fun. It is dimly lit overlooks the casino part. I always get the Filet of Oscar w/ baked potato and salad and the hubby gets the prime rib with mashed patotoes and it's all sooooo good! And the spicy bloody mary's are the best too! I highly recommend this restaurant if you wanna save some $. Don't bother with the Wynn restaurants, overrated."}
{"text":"Had high hopes, but was average at best....  Good hot bread to start. Steak was tough and chewy but had decent flavor, baked potato was huge and pretty good...Salad had dressing that was from a bottle. Lobster was from frozen and not fresh...mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant from a package!  Ordered a chocolate martini and was served some nasty minty drink and returned it....food was not bad for the price, but it was like going to outback pretty much. Also the waitress vanished after she took the order, we has to beg a busser to get more cocktails.  I thought $10.00 for a martini was a bit excessive for a place this far off the strip.    Might give it another try sometime to see if it is any better, but other ratings here of 4 and 5 stars I think are unrealistic at this point.  2.5 stars here, glorified buffet food is my opinion on this first trip."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant not knowing what to expect. When I first entered the host was very friendly. My waitress was on top of everything and her service was excellent. Food was good and reasonably priced. I was even impressed by the manager who stopped by and made sure everything was okay. Restaurant in a nice quiet location that overlooks the casino which is nice. The bar service excellent Wine and high-end Liquor which is always nice to go with good food. I would highly recommend this place to anybody because of the food and service of the staff."}
{"text":"We used to come to this place often & really enjoyed their delicious Prime Rib at very reasonable prices. On our last visit, on March 20 our group of 12 ordered our usual Prime Rib & it was uneatable. The meat was so tough that I ended up returning it. We've had friends that experienced the same thing recently. The Loft has gone from mouth watering Prime Rib to something that resembles Prime Rib but too tough to chew. Thank goodness that The Orleans still has Big Al's!"}
{"text":"stayed at the Orleans and saw the prime rib loft.   ordered the blackened prime rib.  my wife and I said this was the best prime rib we have ever had!  price was great - much less than on the strip."}
{"text":"We were looking for prime rib near T Mobile Arena before a show. So glad we saw some reviews here. Craig was so friendly and made us feel like we were regulars. Angelica was a perfect waitress. Friendly with a smile. Helpful and returned a few times to make sure everything was ok. Our dinners were just what we were looking for. Great prime rib. Would definitely stop by again before a show and feel very comfortable recommending to others. Thanks a million. Two happy customers."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was great my beverages were never empty. Had the gamblers cut of prime rib. Everything was good."}
{"text":"I admit that Prime Rib isn't my first choice, and I was dragged by a dear friend who is a BIG FAN of Prime Rib Loft.  And, I must say....DE-lishious!  I am glad to have been persuaded into going, everything from service to plating (loaded baked potato built by your server in front of you!)  Kudos!  Good meal."}
{"text":"Ate here a year ago. The prime rib was good, not great but I would go back. Only problem is it was very noisy but that might be par for the course in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great deal, great prime rib place for locals.  The prime rib is cooked perfectly every time.  The appetizers were not impressive; and the steak, ordered medium-rare, was served very well-done, and when asked to recook it came out rare and cold, but the 3rd time was a charm and finally came medium-rare.  Prime Rib Loft = stick with the prime rib."}
{"text":"Great prime rib melts in your mouth. Service quick and good. Corn chowder soup very good"}
{"text":"This was just average. My husband had the gambler's cut prime rib, Cajun style and it was very good. My Orleans cut prime rib I had to send back- it was so bland. The second one was better but not great. But I guess you get what you pay for- the price is very reasonable. The salad was standard, and the grilled artichoke was okay. I give them credit for trying something unique!  The best part of the evening was the bananas foster (terrific) and a great price for a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"I'm slow in writing this review as I went earlier this month, but I wanted to be sure to take the time to thank the food server Missy, and Curtis. The service they both provided was not only wonderful, it was done with professionalism and we felt very special being waited on by them both. Each had smiles that made us feel so welcome, the food was delicious too, but we felt spoiled being waited on by them both. Thank you so much, and thank you Craig for sharing some stories of the Vegas 'Old Days', we felt like part of the Prime Rib Loft Family! And, can't wait to go back the next time we are in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous!!! 4 people in our party ready to spend and share food. Waitress immediately says $8 charge to split plate. What if i order anything i want and take bits of family's plate?? Really this is how we like to try different meals while dining. We spend plenty to go out. Its just the principle of the plate fee of eating out. Its supposed to be a treat. Waitress was very demeaning in her announcement of plate charge. Her  name is missy"}
{"text":"For a place \"known for their prime rib\" it was very underwhelming. Ordered the Gambler's cut, was very disappointed that it had almost no fat at all, and without any crust coating the edges it was kinda greasy. Overall pretty bland, and not all that generous. It wasn't quite bad enough to send back, but for $28 there are so many better places to get prime rib.  Service was meh, server didn't really check on us very often, and the place was dead. Also kind of annoyed that the only 2 side options were both potato, and when I told her I was on a low carb diet and asked for vegetables instead, she told me she couldn't do that, and I'd have to buy a side dish of green beans or spinach."}
{"text":"Very underrated, very good prime rib. This place's biggest flaw is probably its perception: prime rib at the Orleans does not carry the same \"chic\" reputation as a restaurant on the strip. But don't let that hold you back. The service is always very good, and there is not a way you will ever leave hungry.  I've tried both the English cut and Cajun Style (among other items), and both were fantastic - specifically, Cajun style is a personal favorite. Incredibly savory, incredibly satisfying. As if the prime rib alone wasn't enough, I've also tried many of their sides, as well - including the shrimp cocktail and baked potato with choice of toppings. The shrimp cocktail was nothing spectacular, but it's hard for me to find a flaw with any of the food here overall. Throw in the bread that is included with your meal, and you won't need to eat the rest of the week."}
{"text":"Prime Rib was excellent!  If you are a lawerys fan you need to try this.  Its better!  Waitress and host very friendly.  And, our bus girl Nadica was so sweet she will make you smile.  Wonderful relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! My wife and I both order the Orleans cut prime rib. Mine was Cajun style. Wow!! Best prime rib I've ate, excellent service in a cozy, dim lit atmosphere.  Can't wait to eat here  again!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to have some prime rib last night and we chose the perfect spot. Had a bottle of wine, some prime rib and an amazing Cesar salad! The soup of the day was chicken fideo which is one of my favorites. Felt like it was my lucky day!      Our server was great, very attentive and helpful he knew his stuff. The ambience was nice it looks like it could be upscale yet casual place. The Orleans casino is fun also we had over a great time! It will be out Vegas go to spot from now on. I highly re comment it."}
{"text":"It seems many people have had good experiences here but mine was just so so. I might have just been expecting this place to be more like the steakhouses in other casinos.  My service was fair at best. I may be nitpicking but just the fact that I'm eating a $24 piece of meat and the waiter asks me to keep my salad fork was a little off. Not to mention he only came by a couple of times during our meal and the entrée came out while I was finishing my salad... Like I said thought I'm probably nitpicking at silly things.  The food was fine. Though, Prime Rib is something of a staple in Vegas and this was just average, it is what you would find in any Station Casino cafe. The Garlic Mashed potatoes were terrible in my humble opinion.  So this review is kind of harsh. I think I just might of been expecting more. Go here if you want a Prime Rib and you're already in the Orleans. Don't make a special trip. Also, I saw a few dinner dates there while I was... If you want to have an impressive red meat dinner this is not the place."}
{"text":"It was not bad, but was not like so great that I'd go out of my way to visit again. Hit this place up on a whim when out on a night and was in the Orleans. Of course I got the prime rib, it was good especially the outer side but a little to  bloody for my taste. I should try it one more time, the restaurant is an old school feel, interesting."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner 2 months ago and had excellent service. If I gave that visit a rating it would be 5 stars. This visit however it's to bad 1 star is the lowest or else I'd give one lower. First off our server never asked what we wanted to drink. Gave us frozen bread. Then charged us 2 dollars extra to have a Caesars salad with our entree. I never dealt with that 2 months ago. Finally when it came time to our entrees all our meals were over cooked and dry.  No flavor at all. Just beware if you come here. The price is reasonable for the food but I'd rather pay a little more for good service if I have to."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in Las Vegas we make it a point to dine at the Prime Rib Loft. In my opinion the food is always delicious and the price is just right.   However, more attention to customer service needs to be had. Without going into much detail, the hostess needs to be trained to be a bit more professional and cater to reasonable customer request.   Overall, the experience was fine. Looking for improvements in the months to come."}
{"text":"This place is a great value for very decent steak and prime rib.  It's not the kind of place you  want to take a date or try to impress someone.  But if you want a great slab of meat for a very fair price then it's worth the trip to Orleans.  The small slab is $20 and the large slab is $27 and both include salad and potato or veggie side.  I also order the garlic sauteed mushrooms for $8 too - they are very tasty."}
{"text":"The prime rib was...ok. I've had better for cheaper.  I ordered the \"Gamblers Cut\". Nothing really wrong with it per se, but it was fairly bland and the horseradish was the same fake horsey sauce you get at Arbys.  I paired it with the garlic mash potatoes instead of baked. It was essentially a gummy glop served on a small plate. Ever had Red Lobster's garlic mash potatoes? Tastes exactly the same.  Service was pretty bad. The hostess was really nice, but we waited about 10 mins after being sat for a server to come over, pour us a glass of iceless water and inform us that our server would be with us in a minute. A minute? I guess she meant 10 mins. Finally our \"real\" server showed up, took our order and promptly disappeared for another 20 mins. Finally she brought the grub....and then apparently went on a permanent break. About 20 mins after we finished eating, we had to ask the hostess for our check (we couldn't wait to get out of there, keep reading) Finally, our server reappeared with the check (she's alive!!!) and then....promptly retreated to the back. We never saw her again. After about 10 mins we went back to the hostess to see if she could handle our check (she did).   All of that would have been bearable if not for this... Unfortunately we were seated right next to a party of 11 middle-aged women having a \"girls night out\". Apparently this party of morons thought they were eating prime rib at a rowdy bar. Remember the tv show \"Roseanne\" and how she would laugh at the end of the opening credits? Multiply that laugh X 11 people, every 5 seconds with the volume turned all the way up. Two tables asked to move to another part of the restaurant and several other people kept covering their ears and looking over their shoulders. Alas, these weren't big enough hints for the clueless  staff to put together and ask the ladies to pipe down.  A shame. It seemed like an otherwise nice place to eat, but I think next time I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  They ran out of lobster tail at 7pm on a Saturday night.  It was their special.     I expected more for the price."}
{"text":"For the price this place can't be beat. Food was well prepared and very tasty. I had the tempura appetizer followed by a house salad. For my main course I had the beef oscar with a baked potato. Rudy was out server and he did an outstanding job of making the meal pleasant and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Ordered the prime rib special. It is a very good value. Everything was tasty, but service can be improved a bit. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The Prime Rib Loft is located in the Orleans Hotel on the second floor and overlooks the casino.  It is a medium-sized, low-ceilinged dining room with an eight-seat bar. Although showing a little wear, it is pleasantly decorated with booths and tables covered in red tablecloths, and the walls are adorned with large murals of band and dance scenes.  The menu is small and heavy on beef dishes.  Indicative of the restaurant's name, the signature food is prime rib.  I recently dined there and had the Orleans Cut, which is 10 oz. of prime rib, accompanied by a chopped lettuce salad and mashed potatoes.  The quality of the meal was satisfactory and the service good.  The ambiance and menu of this restaurant is a throwback to the popular prime rib joints of a bygone era - thick cuts of meat with just passable house salads and vegetables as well as reasonable prices for the food and drinks.  The Prime Rib Loft is not a destination restaurant, but if you find yourself at or near the Orleans Hotel, which is off the Las Vegas Strip, like prime rib, and have a hankering for a decent drink, stop in."}
{"text":"Between the food, service, and price, this place is fantastic. We ate at the bar and had their steak special. For $25, I had a ribeye (cooked perfectly to my request ), baked (or mashed) potato, a couple of  shrimp, sauteed green beans, and salad. It won't be the best steak you ever had but tasty."}
{"text":"The food and waiter service was good and at a good price. The bad thing was the busser. Half of us were still eating when he descended on our table and started removing dishes. When my husband asked him not to, he ignored him then he muttered that was his job and even took my husband's bread plate as he was still eating. The manager was no where to be found."}
{"text":"I love prime rib. I love garlic mash potatoes! The Prime Rib Loft was a good choice for both (their cream corn wasn't too bad either..just extremely sweet).  Our dishes came out pretty quick, but our drinks took longer to come out for some reason (we only ordered a diet coke and lemonade).  Service was eh...two people came by to ask what our drink order was.   Prime Rib Loft..your food was excellent..but the service was.....well...lets just say it could've been better...."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight and it was fantastic,andrea,our waitress was fabulous,i had the porterhouse steak,it was perfectly done,great taste,they could expand they're  draft beer selection,but overall a great experience  would definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was great. My husband and I got the Gambler's Cut. It comes with your choice of corn chowder or salad. I definitely recommend the corn chowder.  I give this place 3 stars because of the hostess. We came here Saturday night. I expect it to be busy, it's a weekend. When we approach the hostess, she asked us if we have a reservation. I say no and she says \"oh, you have to have a reservation. It's a long wait tonight\" She quotes me 45 min to an hour. I look around the restaurant there are tons of tables open and no one is waiting in the lobby. I ask her about it. She tells me \"we have a lot of reservations coming in tonight.\" I say okay and decide to look at OpenTable. It's 8:45pm, I find a reservation for us at 9pm. I go up to the hostess and tell her that I just made a reservation for 9. She gives me this rude look and says that the computer doesn't know that people are sitting at that reserved table. She says \"Have a seat. It's still going to be a wait.\" Another host person approaches us and asks us \"Do you have a reservation? What time?\" I give them our reservation. He looks on the computer and literally sits us right away at 8:54 pm."}
{"text":"Great Meal- Great Service- Great Price.  A well deserved positive review for the Loft at the Orleans. The prime rib, lobster tail, bread, salad ect. Was all fresh and served almost as it was ordered.  I had to ask the waiter if he had a \"rabbit up his sleeve\" as well. My girlfriend and I had tasty entees and drinks for less than $100, Not fancy but special. I would recommend it to my own family. (las vegas local)"}
{"text":"I've been at this establishment several times and the host staff always greets us promptly and is very courteous. Wait staff varies on attentiveness; however, the food is great! You get a salad or soup with your meal. Prior to your meal they serve you hot ciabatta rolls with whipped butter. The caesar salad dressing is made perfect- with just the right anchovies. The prime rib is always tasty- perfectly cooked and seasoned well. They offer pure horseradish and less spicy horseradish sauce. On the side, you have a choice of potato or vegetables. The price of the meal between 3 of us was under $60 without tip. It's a great value. Keep in mind i've had prime rib at Lawry's and Prime Rib Loft is better."}
{"text":"i've eaten here maybe 5 or 6 times , the latest, this weekend ...lost a couple buddies to some \"debauchery pursuits \" so it was me and another bud...had a comp from the casino...the Loft it is...i normally recommend this place to people that are looking for value , especially if they are interested in a slab of prime rib - depending on the size of the meat slab , it cost about $14-$22 including salad or soup, potato and bread - the veggie sides are only $3,  we had the \"gamblers cut \" ... i believe that was a pound in size, also had creamed corn and we had the onion stack and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers - since i had an $80 comp, it covered all the above and 3 desserts we took back to the condo for the gang ( did not have wine ) everything was above average ....except....the prime rib !!!  i was surprised...way too much fat on my slab - my buddies slab was not medium rare...i tell ya though,,,the horseraish cream combined with pure horseradish....whew  !!!  cleans out the nasal passages !!!! I'm hoping this was just an \"off day\" for the Loft because i believe this place normally is of greater value then the CC steakhouse .."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a disappointment. The server was rude with no personality. Prime Rib had no flavor. Salmon was overlooked. The au gratin potatoe serving was the size of a small spoon and were gross. I would recommend a different option when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Good Seafood appetizers and Great Service.  Reasonable priced menu's as well."}
{"text":"The appetizers (fried asparagus) and salads were pretty good. The prime rib and potato were very good and the service was excellent! The manager, Craig, spoke with us casually about the beer I was drinking and brought me another beer on the house. Angelica was a great server as well! Very knowledgeable and very attentive. This was a welcome surprise at the Orleans!"}
{"text":"Went to The Prime Rib Loft for dinner during my weekend stay in Las Vegas not too long ago. Let me tell you... BEST prime rib I have ever had in my life, hands down. I'm not sure why some others on here weren't blown away like I was. It's always a possibility that maybe there are better places out there that I have yet to experience, or they happened to come in on a bad day (it happens), but this was definitely the best I've tried to date, anywhere. It was perfectly cooked the way I asked, incredibly juicy, and it's reasonably priced! I also got the garlic mashed potatoes which was pretty good too. My boyfriend got the loaded baked potato... When I say it's loaded I mean LOADED. We also got the cheesecake, and that wasn't too bad either. :) Overall, the prime rib out-shined everything else we had. Simply amazing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night and the food was very good but meat was over cooked I asked for medium rare and came out more medium. The service was fantastic"}
{"text":"You get a nice slab of meat, well cooked.  Some great sides.  You leave there with good food and at most a bill for about $50 a person even with a couple of cocktails.  Really a great meal for the price.  Initially I thought they overcharged us by a mile but it was correct on the final cc charge."}
{"text":"This restaraunt is a wonderful place to have a nice date with your significant other. The lighting is dim and the service is bright. The food is not cheap but that is quality of food is worth the price. The prime rib is moist and full of meaty flavor. I mean quality texture and mouth feel. It is not a cheap cut of prime rib they serve at the buffet. You can tell the difference with all of your senses. The salads are not worth the price and are generic. The drinks are wonderful. Once again, they serve their water in a glass container and it tastes crisp and clean. I love water. I have eaten here twice and wish I spent more time in Vegas so I could enjoy this place more. The Gamblers Cut with all of the fix-ins is Key."}
{"text":"when this place first opened it was really good, back then I would have given it 5 stars. Now it is just ok. My dad likes to go there, that is why we went.  We started with the grilled artichoke. Usually this is pretty good. Not so much this time. Maybe artichokes are out of season?. It was hard and not very flavorful. The aioli that accompanied it was tasty.  The prime rib was ok, the portions get smaller each time I go. Very tender, good flavor. Nothing outstanding. We all had the same cut. Same side of baked potato. No dessert.  Probably will go again as my dad loves this place."}
{"text":"The Prime Rib Loft is a must check out place for the price and flavor. Like the other yelpers have pointed out, the prime rib is amazing! Well, not everyone but some liked the prime rib for its price. For myself, I had the gamblers cut which is their 14 oz. prime rib. It wasn't bad when you compare it to other places like outback and Black Angus. The price and taste was just right. Did I mention you get soup or salad along with a side dish with your meat? The salad was fabulous with my choice of ranch dressing and the side I chose was Garlic Mashed Potatoes. The garlic mashed was just right, not too overpowering of garlic but there were still hints where u could tell there was garlic. Delicious! Come check this place out if you don't mind coming off the strip.  The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the atmosphere. It was a tad loud for my taste. I mean yes, its a public restaurant but the guys in here dining in were horribly loud and no one from management said a word. THAT is my only issue with The Prime Rib Loft. For the PR Loft, I give the a 3.5 stars, The atmosphere just killed it from getting a four out of five."}
{"text":"We are locals 4 of us went to the DWTS show night out. Chose the Loft based on some of the reviews. Prime rib was good but not even warm. Risotto was too starchy and had been sitting. Salmon way over cooked. The service non existent.  Complained to manager got no charge Desert.  Saw the bus guy 3 times. Wait person twice.  Would not go back. It's not like there are not other choices"}
{"text":"We just ate dinner here and it was amazing. Rudy and Abbey were wonderful. Food was amazing and the service was great. We've stayed at the Orleans four times and this is our first time at the prime rib loft. We will be returning!!! I can't say enough how wonderful it is!!!"}
{"text":"ate hear after cruising the old car show at vivalasvegas rockabilly weekend, was hungry lamf; this place sucked, thank god they had liquor, totally weaksauce! waitress was cool! def. not my fave!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING WAS GOOD...THEN THEY BROUGHT THE PRIME RIB OUT...  I was craving prime rib and I remembered that I had bookmarked this place for their cajun prime rib. I noticed that they offer English Cut so I skipped the Cajun Prime Rib this time. This is what we ordered:  Grilled Artichoke $8 2 Prime Rib, Orleans Cut 10oz English Cut $16 MacMurray Ranch, Sonoma Coast, California $10 - 8oz Carafe Pepsi $3  The grilled artichoke was good. The prime rib came with soup or salad and baked or mashed potato. We both got the Chicken Corn Chowder and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Everything was good except the prime rib. I ordered mine rare and it came out medium rare. I asked our server if I wanted it more rare next time if it was possible ans she said if I came earlier in the day...we were there at 7:15pm...how early do I need to go?!! The English Cut was not as thin as the English Cut from House of Prime Rib or Lawry's. Since it was thicker and more cooked than I had preferred, I found it a little dry.  I'm still thinking about coming back to try the Cajun Style prime rib."}
{"text":"We have been coming here after the NASCAR races every year since 1998. I have seen some highs and less, but always come away feeling I got more than my money's worth. However; The salad was a very good mixed green with a very nice raspberry vinaigrette dressing. It came right after some warm fresh bread. My wife loved her lamb chops, and they were moderately priced. My Orleans cut prime rib was tasty, not fancy. But for the money, a killer deal. The service tonight was the best ever, and much faster too  Definitely not fast food, but really good value. We were in and out in under an hour, which is our record here. They have been slow in the past, but always very accommodating and friendly. Great ambiance for a casino Steakhouse restaurant without becoming intrusive."}
{"text":"Our server was Rudy and he provided some of the best service! Never have I had a server be so friendly and wholesome. He was a good man. The food was excellent as expected. I recommend the Asparagus fries and Corn chowder with you prime rib. (:"}
{"text":"We started with the tempura veggies.  The batter was too heavy more like a beer batter.  The service was marginal and you felt rushed  and they started clearing the table before you finished.  The prime rib was good but a wee bit under seasoned, onion soup was ok, shrimp scampi in puff pastry was really good.  Shrimp cooked well.  Overall experience not welcoming and will never return.  Decor is nice"}
{"text":"Don't let the awful location fool you. It's inside the Orleans which is a dump. But the Loft is above its casino. The service was amazing. The food was surprisingly good. But the salad was a disappointment. Overall, a very solid 4."}
{"text":"If you're going to have a limited menu you better get it right. The Prime Rib Loft exceeds merely getting it right, they get it perfect.  From the gracious welcome at the host stand to the sincere farewell when you depart everything is aimed at providing the ultimate dining experience.  And the do.  The service is attentive and never rushed.  The staff seems sincere in wanting to please, filling beverage glasses moments before they fall empty, clearing extraneous plates and dinnerware, and always staying within earshot in case needed.    Then there is the food.  Now I can only comment on the prime rib but, hey, if you come to a place with the words prime rib in the name you probably want to give it some consideration. Well, you will be glad you did.  Perfectly cooked and as delicious as could be.  Sides.  Ate too much prime rib for more than just a taste.  But it was also spectacular.  No room for dessert despite my taste buds screaming for chocolate soufflé. Maybe next time.  There will be a next time."}
{"text":"Host Desk, Quick , efficient, Nice.  Server and Busser, Fantastic  The Food, Delicious!! The Gamblers Cut, Beefeater and Cajun Style were all had by our table.  Loved!! With both creamy and fresh horseradish! Swimming in au jus!'yummmmm  I had Green Beans instead of potatoes, they were done nicely.  My friend enjoyed her baked potatoe but my other friend didnt care for the potatoes Au Gratin. I wish they had more options.  I will say the Menu was very small as far as amount of choices. They should expand.The options a wee bit.  But all and all, I thoroughly enjoyed my evening and the Prime Rib loft served a great Prime Rib!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Prime rib and meal was outstanding! A little hidden gem! I think it was delicious and I would go there again. Very romantic as well. I enjoyed it all! The bake potato is one of the best I ever had definitely try and you will see what I am referencing! Try and you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was far from great. With a price of $17+ for pasta I expected great. I had the Gorgonzola chicken pasta and I expected a deliciously rich and creamy pasta. Instead I could only describe this as tasting like pasta from a cafeteria. So disappointing.   They were kid friendly, which was helpful. They had good bread and we had a pretty decent clam appetizer. My hubby had some tasty prime rib as well.  They took care of the pasta which I appreciated. Overall, they were friendly and accommodating but the food just wasn't  worth the price."}
{"text":"I've been craving prime rib for MONTHS, so this seemed like an appropriate place to have dinner after Yelp Night: Zarkana.   Pretzel Rolls: Complimentary before the meal. They were okay.. I usually don't like to complain about free stuff, but I'm thinking the \"butter\" they serve is actually margarine.   Ceasar Salad: The actual salad was ordinary, but I especially liked the crisp parmesan wheel that was served up top.   Prime Rib: I got the 10oz Orlean's cut (medium-rare), Stephan got the 14oz Gambler's cut (medium-well) both were ordered cajun blackened. The amount of meat generous for the price, and the cajun seasoning was pretty good- a bit spicy, but wayyy too salty. My cut was overcooked to medium, which was fine for me. I flipped my prime rib over and washed away some of the seasoning in the au jus. Stephan liked that it was served in the jus, and not on the side.  Garlic mashed potatoes: A total let down. The potatoes came out of a box; I didn't believe it until I got a chunk of still dehydrated potatoes in my mouth. There was no flavor what-so-ever, and I'm still baffled that a place like this could serve such sub-par side dishes. Get the baked potato instead.   Service: Sub-par. Stephan counted to 4, the number of times someone looked directly at his glass without refilling. Our server was pretty nonexistent, thankfully our busser took care of the soda refills.   I was really underwhelmed by this place; the prime rib was good (especially for the price), but I was really disappointed by the service and the lack of selection that offered for side dishes and appetizers. There were only 3 other sides that were offered as add ons, and the appetizers were all cold seafood-based dishes like cocktail shrimp."}
{"text":"I took my wife and mother here for Mother's Day. The Cortez room at the Gold Coast used to be one of my favorite restaurants in town and The Prime Rib Loft is another version of it. However, this was my first time eating here. They have a 24 ounce prime rib that is very yummy. The shrimp cocktail is delicious and shrimp are gigantic. I also recommend the vegetable tempura as an appetizer. Rudy was our waiter and he was awesome! Thank you Rudy for helping me show the 2 most important women in my life a good time."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth prime rib!! Delicious baked potatoes!! This place has a great dining atmosphere and affordable pricing as well. It is cool to see your food brought to you on carts and to see your baked potato dressed table side. The waitresses here are attentive and so on point that you will find that your water will never be under 3/4 full (and I drink a lot of water!). This place is one of the many reasons to stay at or visit The Orleans."}
{"text":"Everytime my hubby and I stay at either the Orleans of the Gold Coast (2-3 times a year), we ALWAYS have dinner here! The food is sooooo AMAZING! Everything from the salad to the prime rib to the baked potatoes to the veggies....so DELICIOUS!   This past weekend we took some family members with us and some of us tried the special $24 for a petite steak, baked potato, veggies and 2 lobster tails (plus our salad). Everyone fell in love with this place. They enjoyed the food and the prices are reasonable. For those who ordered the prime rib, they too enjoyed their food. The flavors and portions are GREAT!  If you stay at the Orleans, this is a MUST stop! You will enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some prime rib action after losing some chips at the casino or if you simply want a great meal without dropping too much additional cash (gotta be able to gamble later!), then The Prime Rib Loft is your destination.    The beef is dry aged for 21 days in order for the enzymes in the meat to make it more tender and the drying process evaporates the moisture in the meat intensifying the flavor.    While you wait you get a warm bread basket, but don't eat too much because you want room for the rest of your meal.  I like to have my prime rib barely licked by the flame rare.  The meat comes out thinly sliced, hot and really tender while marinating in a pool au jus.  The waiters are attentive and they bring a toppings cart along with your meal.  You get to tell the waiter how they should dress your potatoes.  Go for the gamblers cut since the meal comes with a soup or salad and a large side of garlic mashed or baked potato.  You're going to be stuffed after the meal so get ready for a massive food coma."}
{"text":"It was ok...  After eating at Lawry's this place just fell flat.  The Prime Rib was really tasty but I got the bone-in 24oz cut and it seemed like 12 oz of it was the massive bone.  I also got the garlic mash and it was less than average.  It looked like someone used an ice cream scoop and plopped it down.  It was cold and just not very good."}
{"text":"Excellent all around! Made a reservation just to be sure-however we went on a Tuesday and it was obviously not really needed-place was empty when we arrived at 5. Both of us got the prime rib which was delicious-and a hefty portion for the price. Service was attentive and quick. We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Food and staff were excellent, went before heading to the movies. Some of the best prime rib I have had in a long time. Go hungry, the only downside was the shrimp scampi ordered on the side, 10 bucks for 2 small shrimp. Just stick with the prime rib and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I cannot speak for the prime rib as I only had the French onion soup. Amazing! Has to be one of the best soups I have ever had. The service and bread was great as well. Will be back to try the prime rib when I am hungrier!"}
{"text":"My friends, like a second family, we're staying at the Orleans and wanted Prine rib for dinner. We entered the restaurant and were seated quickly. We three ordered prime rib with salads and baked potato. Fine. About 15-30 minutes into the meal Jerry needed to find a restroom. He never made it through the prime rib. Whatever it was cleaned him out.  When we explained this to the waiter, he called the acting manager, who in turn called security to take a report on the matter. Fine. While this is taking place, a near computer let's cut of prime is sitting on the edge of the table. Clearly Jerry could not finish his dinner. When the acting manager Lisa K asked Jerry what he needed he said, \"do what you think is right.\" He received 3 verbal apologies and an assurance from the head chef the salad dressing was at normal temperature.  Next comes the bill. Not once did the manager offer to Comp the salad or $24 prime rib dinner for Jerry.  I can tell you as a local I am embarrassed this happened in Las Vegas. I can also state this place will never see 3 patrons set foot in this establishment. Jerry said as much to Lisa and she still didn't get it for some reason. So much for customer comfort or doing right by the patron. Service trumps food every time and typically people return to give a place a second chance. I will not. Ever."}
{"text":"Good food great service staff. Nice setting overlooking the casino floor. Got right in no wait even on a sat night with a busy hotel."}
{"text":"This is the best prime rib we've ever had.  Cooked to perfection and served by the nicest and polite people.  The water/drink person was outstanding.  The waitress (Andrya) was spectacular. The greeters at the check-in desk (man and woman) were phenomenal.  This is always a must-do place to eat 2 hours after arriving in Vegas.  Reservations are recommended but not always necessary.  One elevator that is strictly used for access to the restaurant ~ uptown and classy,  Thank you for always meeting and/or exceeding our expectations."}
{"text":"Seriously. For a restaurant that has prime rib in its name, it really fails to dominate in flavor, presentation and all.  Cajun spice was a load of common table salt (!!), some paprika and nothing much else. So the combination of Cajun spiced prime rib? A total disaster.  Only reason there is an additional star - hard working service staff on Thanksgiving night.  I had better prime rib at Bacchanal Buffet for about the same $$ as a Gambler's cut.  Of course, I am not coming back."}
{"text":"One of the hardest things to adjust to when coming back from Las Vegas is the cost of dining out. I was so accustomed to steak dinners for under $20 that I forgot how much restaurants really charge for a good meal. I have to say it can really smack the happy Vegas frame of mind right out of you.  The Prime Rib Loft is one of the restaurants guilty of distorting the prices of food.  To start, the quality and flavor of meat is nowhere close to The House of Prime Rib. But for the price, who cares?  But to be fair to The Prime Rib Loft, my meal was comparable to the ones I've had at either Broadway or San Mateo Prime.  I usually get the biggest cut (to the dismay of the wife) and spend the next hour trying to stuff in down my belly (again, to the dismay of the wife).  The meal comes with a salad and choice of two side dishes. The prime rib is tender and juicy, but it is also a little fatty and in need of more seasoning.  For dessert, I usually ask for another sliver of meat to top me off and was about to make my request when I felt a sharp pain. It wasn't from my heart but more from my shin. It was my wife's subtle way of telling me not to even dare.  Overall, 3.5 stars but rounded down since they don't have my requisite super hot horseradish."}
{"text":"The prime rib I had was the worst ever. Hate to be negative, but it's great to be number 1 at something even though it's the worst. They bring balance to the universe by making all other prime rib places seem better"}
{"text":"I got the fish. Crusted halibut if you must know. I asked for it to be a little on the Med-Rare side.  It was terrific!"}
{"text":"We made same-day reservations for a party of five on a Sun evening, with much ease, after a long hard day's work at a convention. We wanted to get away from the strip for a quiet relaxing dinner, and indeed that is what we got. The dining room only had about 3 other parties, one of which was a large party. Our male server was extremely attentive although his female helper could have been a little nicer when offering to refill our teas and sodas and could have handled the utensils and dishes a lot more quieter and gentler.   My boyfriend had been here once before and thoroughly enjoyed his Gamblers Cut (14 oz. $22), medium. This time he said it was tougher than he'd like. The rest of us got the Orleans Cut (10 oz. $18), medium rare, and they all tasted great. The prime rib is served already laying in its own au jus on the plate while the horseradish sauce and sides like sauteed mushrooms (extra charge) and garlic mashed potatoes were on separate small dishes. We each also had the option of soup or salad. The garlic mashed potatoes arrived plain with table-side service to add bacon, chives and sour cream (complementary). It didn't taste like it was out of the box as a previous Yelper stated in their May review, and I actually saw a potato hair or two in it (that's what proves they're real!)...wonder if the restaurant had changed this.   The only hiccup we had was the steamed clams appetizer we ordered was too salty. I thought my mom was exaggerating or being picky but we all tasted it and agreed it was too unbearable to eat. We sent it back and our server apologized, agreed it was too salty and suggested perhaps they weren't washed properly. He offered to bring out another batch but we chose the fresh grilled artichoke instead - this appetizer was so good we actually ordered two orders! Also almost forgot to add, they serve a basket of delicious bread and whipped butter in the beginning.   We can't wait to return - great value for the quality of prime rib, and off-strip so that you're away from the dinnertime hustle and bustle. We also won a few hundred dollars playing a Wheel of Fortune slot machine on the way out of The Orleans ;)"}
{"text":"Made a Saturday night reservation for two. Arrived on time and was seated within 5 min.  Took over 5 min for our server to stop by the table. He  must of had too many tables or something- the  place was only about 60% full of patrons though- plenty of tables around.  Ordered and waited forever for the worst T-bone of my life. Shoe leather, dry, tasteless. The salad was better than the steak.   Ordered medium and got well.  Very poor service that evening- no water refills, no bread refills. Could not recommend this restaurant at  all. Eat the buffet and save your money."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking... Prime Rib at The Orleans? I can just go to a stinkin' buffet and get prime rib! No... Not like this place does it! Do yourselves a favor and order BEEF here. It's flavorful and cooked the way you want it. I like my meat bloody and they haven't let me down once in the 6 times I've come here. Do not get any other meat because I think you'll be sorely disappointed. I have taken my good friends and the BF here for dinner and everyone left happy campers. My first visit was with my family. I think every time the fam wants a good steakhouse, we come to this place. The portions are gigantic and the sides are equally delicious. You order your sides ala cart btw and they can easily be shared. The corn and mashed potatoes are my fav. If you opt for the baked potato you can easily share one between two people- they are HUGE! Reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Dining at the Prime Rib Loft was a very pleasant experience, and this was one of few moments where I felt I wasn't getting ripped off by a steakhouse. In addition, the beauty about Prime Rib Loft is that you are getting the same quality prime rib  as you're getting at Lawry's, at half the cost!   Service was good, and was typical of one to expect when going to a high end steakhouse. The interior of the Prime Rib Loft was also pretty swank, and a little too dark for my liking.   The food here was also very good, and the prime rib did not disappoint me one bit. For appetizers, I got the crab stuffed mushroom caps, which was paired with three sauces. It was a decent dish, but I thought it was not worth $12, since the crab taste was not as great as the mushrooms. For the prime rib cut, I got the 14 oz one, and it was seasoned really well and juicy for my liking. The baked potato that came with the prime rib was also good and did not lack any required dressing on it. If you or companion is not a prime rib fan, they also have a pretty good sea bass dish and it tasted fresh.   I really liked Prime Rib Loft and I felt that their signature dish was as good as any prime rib I have tried, and was at a low cost (only 21 bucks for a 14 oz). This is a nice place to take someone on a anniversary or a date."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here since we decided not to drive around to another restaurant. Since we stay here, might as well eat here. We didn't make a reservation but the dining area of the restaurant is pretty big so they took us in right away. We sat near the center part of the room. The restaurant is on a mezzanine level from the ground floor, either you take an elevator up or stairs next to it. From the restaurant you can see the customers being busy (counting and gambling). That's fine, they're get busy gambling while we're get busy eating. I'm not all that crazy about this place. The steak that hubby ordered was so-so and the fish I ordered wasn't impressive either. The place that specializes in prime rib must be good for prime rib, which we didn't order. However, the steak should be good at a great prime rib place, usually.  The only thing that was good is the salad but that couldn't really add to the competition. So, not highly recommended."}
{"text":"winner    I don't normally write a review For something as simple as a cocktail  But I stopped in for a dirty martini  Richard took time to get blue cheese From the kitchen  Made the blue cheese olives  Then proceeded to mix and pour  A perfect grey goose dirty martini"}
{"text":"One of the best prime rib you can get in LV. Juicy. Tender. Delicious. Cooked your way."}
{"text":"I come here every year but today they are off their game.  In fact, this is my second visit here this year.    Our waiter was more concerned with the large groups than our table for two.  Waited 30minutes for our prime rib which one was swimming in the juice.  I guess it was a sign when the host said \"give your waiter some time to order\".....  I need to find another prime rib restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service, food was excellent. Our waiter Rudy was funny, energetic, helpful, awesome. Best waiter ever!"}
{"text":"Quite good! We had really attentive service, and the food was great. I ordered the porterhouse, and my husband ordered prime rib. My steak was cooked nicely (rare as ordered). The au gratin potatoes were pretty good, and the salad with raspberry vinaigrette dressing was delicious. The server dressed the baked potato tableside which was different. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My buddy and I were coming back from Zion and were \"a bit\" dirty and certainly not in formal clothing (shorts and t-shirts). We had made ressies at 6 but were early and got there 5:30. Regardless of our looks, we were greeted and seated with great courtesy. I don't know what this place was like in the past but I consider it a very nice dining room. Clean, austere, and white linens. The staff is professional and served us warm bread. We ordered Tanqueray martinis and they were served in Large martini glasses with ice chips floating on top. Fantastic. The prime rib was ordered medium rare and it was exceptional. So much food. The manager made it a point to come by each table and engage in small talk. We chatted about basketball and the Raiders moving to Vegas.   The wine list (at least the individual glasses) is oriented to price minded mid-westerners, Turning Leaf, Mondavi, etc, but we were fine with it.   I enjoyed this place and would absolutely come here again."}
{"text":"I can forgive this place for not having prime rib that one time.  But when you have your heart set on something and they don't have it, it is pretty disappointing.  I have dined here three times since that incident where they ran out of prime rib.  And each of those three times that I dined here have been wonderful.  Staff has been friendly and food is incredibly delicious for the price you pay.  I would for sure choose this place over Lawry's any day as the food is just as good and for a fraction of the price. The Prime Rib Loft is definitely an awesome place for prime rib and the overall value is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I love prime rib and we had a coupon, so we decided to give this place a try. First off, it wasn't that crowded and with no music playing, it was way too quiet in there. A lot of employees were walking around so it was strange that we had to wait so long before someone came to take our drink order. My water was not cold at all and tasted like tap water and smelled weird. Again, I am a prime rib expert and when my prime rib came, I knew I was in trouble. It looked weird and as soon as I cut in to it and tasted it, I knew I'd been duped. It wasn't prime rib at all! It was cooked to look like prime rib but it tasted and shredded more like pot roast or chuck roast that I use at home when I make shredded beef. I didn't even need a knife because it was falling apart with just the touch of my fork. The au jus was so watered down it was almost clear colored and had zero flavor. I asked for gravy for my mashed potatoes and the waiter put more gravy on my plate than potatoes. The mashed potatoes tasted like watered down instant potatoes. I saw the waiter put a heaping tablespoon of chives on a ladies potato which is ridiculous. He obviously needs retraining. My husband was just as disgusted with his food so we asked the busboy for a box and we took our whole plates of food home for our dogs. The waiter never asked if everything was ok or we would have gone off on him. Shame on this restaurant for trying to sell a different cut of meat as prime rib. Beware of this place. Food and service suck."}
{"text":"Hello. Stayed in Vegas mid November at Venetian. We visit Vegas twice a year and enjoy a Prime Rib Dinner. We went to PRL after being less than impressed with Lawrys. Weird seating, old carpet, and mediocre service had us searching for an alternative. We found PRL at the Orleans. We weren't expecting much but from the second we stepped out of the elevator until we left we were very pleasantly surprised. Yes it's old school but everything is new (ish). The old school maitre 'd is excellent. Graig is his name. Professional, welcoming, friendly and discrete. And by discrete I mean he approaches tables to add to the experience when he can, not just coming round like some do asking u how ur food is when u have a mouthful. Our waitress, Missy, was also beautifully presented (as all the staff were) professional, and very friendly. The prime rib was a little underdone(I'd recommend ordering one higher level than you normally like ur steak done) but the appetizers and deserts were different and showed some thought by the chef. My wife and I had a wonderful meal and as another reviewer said, the place seemed to have only happy customers. We will certainly be back, and for half the price of Lawrys."}
{"text":"Basically $1/oz of prime rib.  Totally worth it!  And it comes with soup/salad and a potato =d  The first night my bf and I went there, it was very empty and our server was VERY NICE.  This is what we got:  Salmon: not bad but I didn't like the stuff it was on top prime rib: soooo good =d broccoli with cheddar beer sauce:  my bf doesn't like cheese but he likes that, I LOVE cheese but I didn't like that =P grilled artichoke:  very good!  But I think it's conditional, it was made extremely well the first night we had it.  The second night, when there were more people, the grilling and aioli lacked =T"}

{"text":"RECKLESS HANDLING OF MY CREDIT CARD!!! For reasons neither the restaurant manager, nor Boyd Gaming Corporate, could explain, they ran my credit card 7 times in 3 minutes, even though they received approval from VISA on each of the first three attempts.  After that VISA froze my card due to \"suspicious activity\".  Based on my experience, DON'T TRUST THE PRIME RIB LOFT AT THE ORLEANS WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD - PAY CASH IF YOU GO THERE."}
{"text":"Good please Enjoy their food. Working friendly (not to friendly but nice). French Onion Soup taste, love the bowl it's served in... worth a visit!  Bread is good, butter is hard and can't spread. Both Potato's sides are good. Meat is yummy!"}
{"text":"We made reservations at Prime Rib Loft to eat before Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Of the choices at The Orleans, this seemed to have the most promise. The ambiance is pleasant- I liked that it's almost like a loft & feels separated from the casino. 3 of my g.f.'s were all over the beef selections & made their choices fairly quickly; however, the 2 of us who didn't go the beef route had a hard time with the 4 alternate options. I'm on a pretty restrictive diet right now (it's totally raining on my yelpventuring parade, by the way!) so it was frustrating to almost fear I'd be eating bread & a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Thank goodness I put my big girl pants on & decided on the bourbon chicken... because the bread was mediocre (soft, yes. but that's it.) & a monkey could make better garlic mashed potatoes (watery? where exactly does the garlic factor in? if my BBQ sauce hadn't dripped onto them, they'd have been bland.) My entrée came with a salad that was just ok. The tomatoes were diced & the red onions were sliced paper thin; nothing to get nitpicky about except that they contributed to the salad being almost soggy. I didn't super care for the cut of chicken but the sauce was incredible (I've been eating pop tarts, potato-anything & Panera Bread, since I've been sick, so their bourbon sauce made my tastebuds smile!). Also, while it's a tad too salty, I highly enjoyed their whipped butter- it gave the bread, potatoes & green beans much needed flavor. The girls who got beef all enjoyed their dishes, along with my partner in poultry crime who got the marsala. The service was satisfactory, no complaints. Overall, I'd go there again... I wouldn't go out of my way (frankly, I'll stick with Outback) but it'd be my choice if I was at The Orleans for an event. I'd also suggest reservations, because the place was hopping, esp. being an event nite."}
{"text":"We went here last night for my mother's 87th birthday dinner because she loves prime rib. For the price, this place is lacking in service. Luckily the bus person was a bit attentive to refilling our water and clearing our plates - but our waitress took our order and basically had nothing much to do with us the rest of the dinner. I even had to take our receipt and pay at the front check-in because we were tired of waiting for the waitress to come for the bill. The lack of service was reflected in her tip.  The food was ok but nothing to brag about. The bread basket was lined with a towel that literally had a bunch of lint in the fold - yuck! The bread itself was obviously microwaved and hardened to inedible rather quickly. Be sure to order your dressing on the side or your salad will be swimming in it.   Last point - We made it known to the restaurant when making our online reservation and that we were celebrating a birthday - and they did absolutely nothing to acknowledge her or the event. Most places at least will grant you a small birthday dish of ice cream. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The menu they have shorten it and took out some of the good stuff. (Fried calamari, stuffed mushroom, sea bass etc) The chairs are new and very heavy to move. The dessert the seasonal berries they used to give you a whole slice of grilled pound cake now it's half a slice. It used to taste so good now it's tasteless and dry. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Prime rib here is by far the best!!!! It melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"This was a great meal for the eight of us visiting Las Vegas. We were looking for a good hunk of beef without the Las Vegas Strip pricing. My wife the vegetarian, ordered a simple off menu pasta with butter and parmesan based coating and veggies. She liked it. I had the Beefeater Cut. 24 ozs of bone-in prime rib for a wonderful price. With the perfect medium rare color, I assume sous vide. The paper thin \"skin\" was slightly chewy, but it was only the outer most crust. The interior was perfect. Finished with an olive oil cake and ice cream. Perfect meal, not overpriced. Mindy our server was perfectly attentive. The hostess and manager were all smiles. The Orleans was a great experience."}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere to eat before a show at the Orleans we decided on The Prime Rib Loft.  Our table overlooked the casino.  Nice for people watching.  The restaurant wasn't too busy.  Only a few tables besides ours.  They have a full bar but no cocktail menu.  I love a good cocktail menu.  We were surprised by an app of  tempura vegetables compliments of the chef.  Hubby ordered the Prime Rib Beefeater Cut (24oz) Blackened Cajun Style and I ordered the Loft Scampi.  Our entrees came out quick and we were happy with them.  Service was excellent.  The manager Patricia stopped by our table and checked on us.  For dessert we had the fondue and cheesecake.  They were OK.  Prices are inexpensive.  So overall definitely a good meal for the price."}
{"text":"Not really all too great. I liked the broiled Seabass, but I wasn't too fond of the prime rib... To be fair, red meat isn't my thing, so I think it's probably reasonably priced for a decent hunk of prime rib.  The service was alright. Good in the beginning, good in the end... but not really existent between the bookends.   The apple pie dessert was too sweet, even for me... And I love apple pie! Not enough vegetables to choose from, not many sides or options. The side soup was too salty (vegetable soup), and the side salad was quite basic.  Nothing splendid."}
{"text":"Always have a good meal here. The southwest eggrolls are good but my faves are the cream corn and banana foster. My lamb was over cooked but the rest of my party enjoyed their food. Server Wolleshe was good and the busboy was really on top of things."}
{"text":"Visited the Loft last March.  Decided to have dinner before catching a movie.  We walked around and decided to have steak for dinner.  We chose the Loft over the other steakhouse in Orleans because it reminded us of \"old Vegas\".  The low ceilings and dimly lit dining area were actually very nice.  Others have reviewed the ambiance; yes it's true... you can hear the noise from the casino, but that didn't really bother me.  The loud music at Gordon Ramsey's actually bothers me more.  Anyhow, the food was delicious and priced appropriately.  I had a filet and my GF had the New York steak.  The sides were fine and we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine.  All of that for less than what I would usually pay for one meal at other steak houses."}
{"text":"So, if you're reading this, you're probably looking for a restaurant with great prime rib. When I was in Vegas I wanted a good, substantial, reasonably priced prime rib, and I got it at the loft. I'm sure, there's better prime ribs in the world, but if you want high quality, bang for your buck, I recommend this place. Here's a cut and paste from their menu.  Roast Prime Rib Featuring our 21 Day Dry Aged Prime Rib of Beef To insure the highest quality and tenderness we dry age our prime ribs on property, season with sea salt and cracked pepper then slow-roast for your dining pleasure. The Orleans Cut $ 17 10 oz. of our most popular cut The Gamblers Cut $21 14 oz. sliced thick for your pleasure The Beefeater Cut $28 24 oz. for the serious beef eater. Served bone-on  I got the beefeater, and it was fantastic, but couldn't finish it. My wife got the gambler, and she couldn't finish it. My father in law got the chicken, he liked it, but it was a weird choice. Anyways, nothing bad to say, good stuff."}
{"text":"Getting into Las Vegas a little late my wife and I wanted Prime Rib. I Googled Prime Rib and the Loft came up. Having never been to the Orleans Casino I was a little skeptical with it being out of the way and off the Strip or downtown. We drove over and the casino itself was pretty crowded. We walked in and went the wrong way and found another restaurant that served Prime Rib for a near identical price. The name of this restaurant didn't sound familiar so we walked in the opposite direction. From the outside it looked really expensive. We looked at the menu and decided to go up. We were seated after waiting about 10 minutes without a reservation, even though there were several open tables.  The pricing is fair. We decided on the Seafood appetizer and the Beefeater Cut with mashed potatoes and a Caesar Salad to share. The salad was a little skimpy but had good flavor. The Seafood Appetizer was also very good. When the Prime Rib arrived the meat was perfectly cooked medium rare with a slight amount of fat. The peppercorn crust made the meat very tasty with the horseradish sour cream and the Au Jus.  My only complaint is the water that is suppose to be some special water (don't remember the name of the water) but appeared to be recycled bottles that are refilled by the wait staff. Overall good food at a decent price. I would go back again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, DO NOT order the seafood sampler! The ceviche was a small cup with two shrimp with some chopped up looked like shredded chicken underneath. There is also 1 crab leg, yes 1, an oyster, and I lucked out with 1 rotten clam. Unfortunately, I didn't realize it was rotten until it was in my mouth. Yeah awesome. They thankfully took that off of my bill but the prime rib was ehhhh for the price."}
{"text":"The prime rib was very good. Great ceaser salad. We had great service. We would likely go back. Priced well."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Service felt super rushed. Always wanted to check this place out, it looked interesting, but now I won't go back. Shrimp scampi had no flavor and super dry; had no sauce. Prime rib is good, that's why I gave a star, but that's it. I do not recommend this place. It's meh."}
{"text":"Went Friday night, and was very pleased with some of the minor tweaks they have made.  As usual, the best prime rib in town for under $50 a plate.  Must order Bone In (BeefEater Cut) and Cajun Blackened.  The Blackened makes your order naturally come out 1 degree more done than you order, so if you like medium rare prime rib, order rare.  They have upgraded the stemware and the wine list, points I had noted in prior reviews through the casino surveys and on yelp.  Bravo.  Its the Orleans, so its not ultra high end fine dining, but its good food at great prices, with a decent atmosphere.  Tough to beat.   If you like prime rib, you really need to try the cajun rubbed bone in.  Its just amazing.  Comes with a salad and a potato.  The \"loaded\" baked potato is prepared tableside, a nice touch.  Continuous management overseeing this place and keeping it ship shape - I have seen the same manager here for at least the 8 years that I have been coming here."}
{"text":"Nothing special!  I had the prime rib 10 oz cut and it was ok.  It is not the best prime rib I had.  Waitress was sloppy.  Ice tea took forever to get to the table.   Refill never showed up.  Clams did not taste all that great. So probably will try someplace new next time."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place so the next time I was in Vegas with a friend we stopped by. I kind of liked the way they are open to the gambling floor below. Maybe it's the whole Vegas vibe. The appetizers we ordered \"sliders\" don't seem to be on the menu any more. They were little buttery soft slices of meat on a fluffy half biscuit with some small greens that looked like radish sprouts. We drove a few hundred miles to get to Vegas so we were both pretty hungry so for dinner we each ordered the 22oz. Beefeater cut prime rib. Mmmmm it cuts it's meatsis with it's forksis \"best prime rib I have eaten in a long time\"......Thanks to Vegas prices we both ate our weight in really good prime rib and drank 2 good bottles of wine for under $100.00. The food coma that night was sweet!"}
{"text":"During our semi annual trip to Las Vegas we always stop at the PRL.  The food is amazing and the prices aren't ridiculous.  The main thing that prevents the PRL from a five star review to me is the service.  Everytime we go the service is unfriendly, inattentive or plain rude.   The bussers are nice but the waiters and waitresses seem to be put out to provide any help.   They seem like they hate their job.  Go for the food not the service!"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday for dinner with a group of six of us. Service was so so and same with the food. Prices weren't bad and the interior is pretty 70s like?  No real complains but nothing to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"The steak had no taste, the salad came out of a bag and the potatoes were bland.  The service was great"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service.  The food was average.  I used a visa gift card and told the waitress it was for $50 and I included cash to pay the rest of the bill.  After a long wait she returned and ran the gift card for $15.  I asked that they fix it and run it for the correct amount.  Again, after a painfully long wait, I went to the front and asked what was taking so long.  They stated that they could not fix it because the credit card/gift card company would charge them.  How is this my problem?  I paid with a regular credit card and did not leave much of a tip since the waitress let us sit there without letting me know what was going on.  Las Vegas is a hot spot for food and restaurants.  There is no room for poor service and average food in a market like this one."}
{"text":"Our experience here was good, but what made it exceptional was our server Rudy. He displayed great personality and asked how our dinner was or if we needed anything at very well placed moments in our dinner and conversation. We talked about what a great waiter he was as we reviewed our dining experiences leaving LV. I'm sorry I cannot remember his assistant's name, but he added extra service at just the right moments as well. We ate dinner there on 7/29, so I hope this helps the restaurant management figure out who that is. The food was really good, but the service deserves 5 stars. Thank you Rudy."}
{"text":"The first reviews I read were all positive, but just before my trip to Vegas a few negative ones began to show up here. I figured I would it a try anyway. There was a huge wedding party and a large birthday party going on when we arrived at 6:50PM on Saturday, November 21, 2009. The hostess made a point of telling us they were very busy and short-handed. In spite of their being full, we were seated promptly at 7:00. When seated we were told to prepare to wait to be waited on. The waitress came promptly to take our order. The service was timely if not overly friendly. It was really, really L-O-U-D in there.  I've had a lot of trouble with prime rib lately, where ever I have gone. It always comes too rare. This was no exception. Just to be safe I ordered mine medium. Two bites were actually so raw as to almost make me gag. My wife ordered hers medium-well and it came out well done. She loved it. The garlic mashed potatoes were just okay - nothing to rave about, however.  At $40 for two, including 20% tip and just water to drink, I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. I  highly recommend trying the Cajun cut. Spices just perfect. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great prime rib and a good experience. There was so much food that my mom and I split the meal. The staff, however, were hit and miss. The male who helped us on Saturday 5/23 at 530pm was fantastic and very hospitable. However the very pregnant waitress was short and kinda rude. Her attitude didn't ruin the experience which made this dinner a great one for us without having to leave the hotel."}
{"text":"I swear the butcher in the back has depth perception problems, because 10oz of prime rib looked more like 20oz, and that's a good thing!  Prime Rib Loft is a great stop for a nice meal at a very reasonable price.  They have the classic steakhouse menu with great appetizers, salads, and main courses.  We ate like kings for under $80 and loved every pound of food.  You must try the prime rib.  Their rub is delish and that crust is so darn yummy."}
{"text":"Restaurant rated the best prime rib in Vegas!  I thought it was ok. Pricey for what you get. Service was slow and the waiter blamed it on the bartender.  Remember, located in a casino, smoking is allowed."}
{"text":"Visited in May. The prime rib is more expensive than you get at your cheap Vegas eateries, and it is a higher quality, for sure, but not so high of a quality that you have an orgasm. It's better, but you pay for that, although not obscenely. The restaurant is well run, they do a good job. I had a basic prime rib meal, nothing exotic, and it was worth paying a little more for the better quality cut of prime rib and higher quality service. It's worth another indulgent meal next time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"After seeing Dennis Miller in the Orleans showroom (Dennis rocked - the showroom is a whole other Yelp) I was pretty hungry I didn't feel like waiting until I got back to the Strip to eat. I discover the hidden Prime Rib Loft. You take stairs from the casino floor up to, well, a loft. Thus is the Prime Rib Loft. A kind of dark restaurant hidden away in an off strip casino. However, due to the location, you get to stare at the Orleans' creepy faux Mardis Gras float heads as you dine. I wish I would have taken a picture to share - it's almost surreal.   The food: as you can tell by the name this is a vegan restaurant. Not a single dead animal on the menu - nawh, just kidding. The name says it all. A basic dinner: a salad (I had the Cesar - not bad), a decent cut of beef, and your choice of baked or mashed. It's not great but it's solid. It's what you expect. That's never a bad thing!   The wine list was surprisingly good considering the restaurant. I had a by the glass Malbec that went well with the beefy dinner. The only actual disappointment of the night was the dessert - the cheesecake was a bit dry and tasteless. Oh well, it's not called the Cheesecake Loft is it?   Also, the prices are quite reasonable.   Bottom line: is it worth a $20 taxi ride from the strip? No. But if you happen to be in the Orleans - it's a pretty good meal at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the prime rib loft for nearly a decade and have recommended it time after time again to friends and clients alike who always walked away happy from their meals. Now I'm not a big yelper but I wanted to reach out somehow to the loft in hopes that things will change for the better.   Change is what they have done. They've changed the decor from the dark and misty cellar ambiance you'd find in a steak house in New Orleans to a bright, less authentic, setting.   After the initial shock of he decor change I brushed it off because the food is awesome and my favorite dish in this town is their Oscar filet. Not only was the filet removed from the menu but there was not a filet period.   The menu used to be a sturdy book menu that you'd find in traditional steak houses but this was replaced with a thin paper menu that totally took away from the luxury.   The bread- petty I know but I love carbs- was different and transferred from delicious buttery rolls to bread sticks. Again, luxury removed.   Lastly, the carb fan inside me again emerges, mashed potatoes were not offered where they traditionally had been. I'm sorry- when I go to a steak house I want masked potatoes. Instead baked and au gratin were offered which is strange considering mashed potatoes are cheaper for the house to make.   In short- the loft used to be an amazing place to eat if you wanted to spend a little more on a popular local haunt. The changes they have made are a huge let down to its legacy and whoever is responsible for these changes does not deserve this place and the legacy they have ruined."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. We shared a medium size cut of prime rib, medium rare and it was done perfectly. We shared a baked potato and one half was the size of a normal potato. The salad was very fresh and a good size. I'd recommend sharing if you are not a big eater; it was more than enough. Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert; but those looked yummy too."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible doesn't being to describe our experience, despite the restaurant being dead on a Friday night. Sub-par food and some of the worst service I've ever experienced. The waiter acted like us being there was an inconvenience to his life. About the food...  Asparagus fries were $8.50 for 5 fries. Best tasting  part of the entire meal but way too small of a portion.   House salad looked like it came out a stale bag of lettuce from the dollar general, with a huge slop of ranch dressing on top. There was about 6x the amount of dressing needed. All either of us could taste was ranch dressing. It was actually really good dressing but that's beside the point.   Baked potato was lukewarm and the server put so much butter and sour cream I couldn't taste anything else. Au gratin potatoes looked like they had been sitting all night on the warmer and my girlfriend had one bite before refusing their brown cheesey garbage again.   Both of our cuts (Gamblers + Cajun) were extremely fatty and nothing to write home about. I'd estimate about 1/3 of each was pure fat and thrown out. We recently dry aged some prime rib roast at home for 3 days and it was amazing. These 21 day dry aged cuts didn't have anywhere near the flavor of what we made at home in 3 days.   When we were clearly ready to get boxed up, our server and his assistant went to the back and mysteriously vanished. Waited about 8 mins before the manager asked if we wanted to get boxed up and we could finally get the hell out of there.   I'd probably leave 0 stars if I could but let's call it one star for the asparagus fries and some really good ranch dressing."}
{"text":"If you're going out for prime rib in Las Vegas this is the spot to go. The service is excellent prices are good manager caters to every need. The bartender is excellent makes the drinks nice and strong for the price. I would highly recommend this place to anybody who wants local prices with Las Vegas strip style type of food. This is a nice getaway from the strip steak prices not too far off of the strip with local prices. Try it out and see what you think it's like being on the strip without all the hassle of traffic and strip prices."}
{"text":"Chalk this up to \"it looked better on Open Table than it turned out to be.\"  The good: there's no shortage of beef when you order the prime rib. It's a tad chewy compared to what you might find closer to the Strip, but it does come out to order  The ambiance in the room is that of a Holiday Inn dining room. It's low-roller nice, not high-roller nice, and service is good but not that of a fine dining restaurant (which this really isn't.) The same music playing in the casino plays overhead, complete with announcements about slot tournaments and the Players Club.  But they're not charging Strip fine dining prices for the experience of parking your car yourself and walking past the TGI Friday's and Fuddruckers in the casino to get here either. So if you want a big hunk of beef and you set your expectations accordingly you can have a nice meal."}
{"text":"While the decor is a little dated, it seems to fit pretty well at the Orleans! We called ahead for a reservation (on a Wed night) but realized we didn't need one when we arrived because they were empty. The servers were prompt and very friendly - a nice change from other casino restaurants! i ordered the prime rib and my wife ordered the steak and lobster special. Both dishes were cooked perfectly and arrived with a huge baked potato loaded with butter, sour cream, chives, and bacon. For the price, I would say it's the best prime rib I have had in Vegas (and the lobster was excellent too!). If you order prime rib, make sure you get their horseradish. It is so hot that it will make anyone cry!"}
{"text":"Last night was our second time dining at the loft. We were seated in the balcony area overlooking the players table below. Knocking off one star only because my medium rare prime rib was a little tough around the edges, but the center was delicious. Creamed corn is yummy. Shrimp cocktail is tasty as well. Overall, the service was good, food was great, prices were amazing. We will be back... :)"}
{"text":"I recently visited this restaurant for the first time and was both pleasantly surprised by the food quality and utterly dismayed over the attitude of our server.  The restaurant is truly a \"loft\", located upstairs inside the Orleans Hotel and accessible either by stairway or elevator.  I was running late for my reservation and they were able to accommodate happily, adjusting somewhat my reservation by 15 minutes.  That, however, is almost where the great service stopped.  Overall, the main dining area approximates elegance, but there were many families dining with children and the prices aren't exorbitant.  The prime rib is available in several cuts, escalating in size and price.  Steaks are also available and all is cooked to order.  The night I visited they had a special for a smallish steak and two lobster tails for a very reasonable price.  In addition to a complimentary bread mix there are also several appetizers available - we ordered the stuffed mushroom caps and they were good but not great.  The only real negative for me was our server.  After asking the fantastic busboy about our cocktail order, we were directed to ask our server.  The restaurant has a full bar, but there is only a wine and beer list available at the table, so no mention of specialty cocktails.  When our waiter arrived he was unshaven and dour.  When I asked if they could make a Bahama Mama (a fairly common rum cocktail), the waiter stared blankly and said he'd never heard of it.  He did inquire and they were able to make the drinks, but our waiter never once smiled or engaged us in any way other than the most perfunctory of requests required to get our orders.  Basically, his attitude was a wet blanket on what otherwise would have been a really fine meal.  While I can eagerly recommend the restaurant, I would also request other seating if this guy was ever our server again."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  I had heard about this restaurant and even though it was located off the strip at the Orleans I decided to give it a try knowing that I wanted prime rib and it's their specialty.   Unfortunately the service was ok, prime rib underwhelming and not at all tasty.    It's a older restaurant, but also wasn't expecting anything to fancy but I guess I just expected a great prime rib but instead it was nothing special."}
{"text":"We went searching for a new steakhouse to try and a friend told us about the Prime Rib Loft. The atmosphere is very nice, the murals fit with the general feel of The Orleans. Prime rib isn't my first choice so I had the New York strip. Maybe this is where I went wrong. If you are looking at patronizing this restaurant I would lower your expectations. Think: less steakhouse, more Applebees. The salad was typical of a house salad: watery lettuce and a few olives. No big deal, it's to be expected at a steakhouse. The steak itself was very dry. The server asked us if needed A1. This should have been a red flag. A good steak should never require any additional seasoning. The steak was cooked medium and had the appropriate amount of coloring. Taste itself was pretty bland and disappointing. It needed some pepper or basic seasoning. It seemed to me that the steak was finished cooking before other people's and they left it under the heat lamp too long. Unacceptable, especially at the price. I really love the mashed potato cart, it's rare to find restaurants that still do this. Overall, I would say the atmosphere is good but the quality is disappointing. The service was decent but if they got busy I would worry. There are so many great steakhouses in this town, this place is not one of them."}
{"text":"The Prime Rib Loft at the Orleans Casino The Prime Rib Loft exemplifies attention to detail, something sadly overlooked in many restaurants nowadays. From the moment you ascend the gracefully curving stairway to the dining room, you are subtly soothed and relaxed, likely without even being aware of the cause. From the calming patterns of the flagstones set in the walls of the stairwell to the subdued red teardrop shaped lamps lighting the hand painted Jazz Band murals lining the walls you find the stresses of life and that tenseness of your posture slowly easing and a relaxed smile brightening your visage. For those desiring it, one wall of the dining room offers a lofty vantage of the main casino floor, allowing the diners to remain aloof from the noise and bustle yet still enjoy the ebb and flow of the vibrant casino life. I was pleased to note that I could not detect even the faintest hint of cigarette smoke despite my location above the casino, a credit to the architects or interior designers in my opinion.     After being seated by the charming hostess, I was immediately offered a glass of water kept constantly full from unique styled bottles rather than the standard, boring pitcher. The water hadn't the slightest hint of chemical taint so often found in public restaurants. Along with the water, I was treated to a basket of fresh, hot rolls, one type of which was a delicious pretzel bread and a ramekin of soft, sweet whipped butter.  Finding myself relaxed, at ease and feeling decidedly pampered, my server Jose arrived to inquire if I would like to order. He skillfully assisted me in narrowing my choices to the exact correct meal with the perfect choice of wine.  I have to assume the blue cheese dressing for my salad was crafted in house as it had the perfect blend of creamy dressing to blue cheese crumbles, creamy and flavorful without being overpowering. The salad had a nice blend of color with a clever flatbread garnish and a chilled salad fork.  Jose displayed his superior skills by not hovering but being readily available and, most importantly, his timing, delivering my entrée after I had completely finished my salad and had a few moments for it to settle. Again, this is something many people seem to be oblivious to, but I greatly respect. Having my meal unceremoniously dumped in front of me when I am half done with my salad, soup or appetizer, in my opinion, displays both discourtesy and a lack of experience or skill. Among other things, it makes me feel rushed and leaves me deciding if I wish to waste half my salad or attempt to enjoy cold food.  The prime rib was absolutely perfect! Done exactly as I requested, coated with an incredible blackened seasoning with a delightful bite to it and containing exactly enough fat to ensure a marvelous flavor and meat that is moist and tender, without leaving an enormous clump of fat as is so common with lower grades of prime rib. The au jus was obviously fresh and well made, light and flavorful, not the thick, dark, salty liquid I can only assume comes from a can that is so commonly provided.   The reasonably priced domestic Merlot suggested by Jose was the absolute perfect complement to the dinner!  A flawless experience is rare in the extreme, and I have to admit that in this case, I found the garlic mashed potatoes moderately uninspiring with little noticeable garlic flavor. The baked potato may have been a preferable choice, though I would honestly have preferred it if replacing the starch with a vegetable selection had been an option. Ala carte vegetable dishes were available for additional cost (and I should note that I found the price of the prime rib extremely reasonable at less than twenty dollars) but with the popularity of low-carb diets, I would think replacing the starch portion would be an option.   For the perfect finish to the meal, I chose the daily dessert option, which today was Black Forest Cake. Fortuitously, this is one of my favorite desserts and I was not disappointed in the slightest. This was served with a modest chocolate syrup drizzle for a garnish, not swimming in a pool like many places. The cake had a perfect moist, puddingy texture.   In summary, what would have been a delicious dinner transcended into the realm of a dining experience purely as a result of the details. The attentive, friendly staff, the ambiance, the timing, the chilled salad fork, the water in bottles, the softened butter; these are the things that exemplify a quality restaurant over the common corporate eateries. In a state of near reverence from the dining experience, I took the time to speak with the manager, Susan, and compliment both Jose's outstanding service and her obviously skillful management. It was the service above and beyond the normal that prompted me to write this review."}
{"text":"\"The Prime Rib Loft\" needs to improve on their customer service.  If your reading this your probably hungry and looking for a good place to eat. So the question your asking is this place any good. The food is okay. The prime rib was a bit too dry and bland. Still eatable. The baked potato was AMAZING. Sadly that's all I have to say because I had a horrible, embarrassing experience here and I invite you to read my experience at \"The Prime Rib Loft\".   THE NOT SO GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY  GETTING A TABLE: I dinned here with my family a party of 6 on Saturday at around 8:30 on a not so busy night. So getting a table won't be a problem, we were seated right away after our reservation was honored.   SERVICE - Let me start by saying I work at a restaurant here in Las Vegas, so I have the experience and knowledge to recognize good or bad service. Our experience at this restaurant was overall: disappointing.   Our server took her sweet time in greeting us, taking drink orders and finally 30 minutes later the dinner order. Ok no problem, no need to be rushed. Suddenly I noticed we were being ignored by out server. Refills were not handled at a reasonable time, and salads took more then expected to arrive. The busser/food server assistant was the only professional worker there. Finally after probably 30 more minutes after our salad our dinner arrived and by then, our party lost their appetite after feeling neglected after waiting so much. The manager was not helpful at all. There was a prime rib at our table that was served warm, so we flagged the manager and we asked him why did our dinner take so long? They replied with one of the most stupid excuses, \"because we are busy\". I've learned that this excuse it's irrelevant to the guest, it doesn't fix the problem it only makes the guest feel like a dumbass! After that the manager failed BIG time! He brought out a smaller prime rib and I told my friend, \"didn't you order a larger cut?\"   So enough was enough, I was disappointed and embarrassed that the manger and waiter couldn't rise to the challenge at making the rest of our dinner outshine their mistakes. The manager comped a few things and never offered a dessert menu. Sucks because we were celebrating a 60th birthday, and we told them twice!   I walked out embarrassed at receiving one of the most dullest, laziest customer experiences. Thankfully the food wasn't half bad.   To conclude I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. I know it's located at The Orleans and you shouldn't expect greatness. But can I ask you \"The Prime Rib Loft\" to put a smile on, and give better service and to turn on some music, lol. Everyone here looked like they didn't want to work.   1 star for the Food a Server Assistant 1 star for the BAKED POTATO"}
{"text":"What a gem in Vegas. This recent Thanksgiving 2014 trip, bro and I were going to go to Gallagher's or some other fancy steak place, until a good friend told me to try this place at the Orleans. We were not disappointed. The price point was reasonable - the meal included salad, sides, and necessary sauces. I got the 1.5 lb prime rib medium rare and bro the 14 oz. NY steak. The prime rib is gargantuan of pure reddish beef, not too salty, just tender and flavorful. I took the bone home to trim and give to Fido for his enjoyment. Au jus is just the right amount of saltines, nothing too salty or bland. Creamy horseradish sauce a delectable accent, and the garlic mashed potatoes were plentiful and unique. I did not even eat all of the mashed potatoes. I got to try some NY steak and at medium, it had a great char and tender flavor. I would have ordered it med.-rare if I ordered it, but bro likes it a bit more done. Nonetheless, the steak is a true NY steak and aged well.  At this place, a prime rib is a prime rib, and a NY steak is a NY steak -- why state the obvious you ask? Because in my other review of Sam's Town Firelight buffet, they were passing off prime rib AS NY steak. I thought it was really funny that they do so. Therefore, I add pictures here so there can be no doubt which is which.  A big filling meal for two big guys, just under $60 before tip (no alcohol)...cannot go wrong. Very close to THE Steak House in Circus Circus in value, taste, and presentation, although, we missed the charming accent of the attractive and shapely Eastern European hostess at THE Steak House.  Décor was New Orleans style, kinda old school, but the place was large enough and since we went on a Monday evening, quiet. Service was impeccable and prompt. As far as value for this price point, here in Vegas, it cannot be beat. Next time when we raise the price point a notch or two, then that's a different level of comparison.  Try this place! We were not steered wrong (no pun intended), just an honestly-priced place for pure beef."}
{"text":"I had quite the experience years ago with my family. I went back hoping they could rekindle that awesomeness that I experienced back then.   I went with my mom and dad that time. They sat us and our waiter greeted us. They provided us bread and too our order shortly after. They didn't have the corn chowder that I found to be so awesome before, so instead we got the Mexican soup. As my main entree, I ordered the flat iron steak with a lobster tail green beans, and garlic mashed potatoes. I enjoyed my steak along with my lobster tail and sides, even though it may not be 5 star restaurant quality. For the price, it is definitely worth it and a nice place to eat if you don't want to break the bank."}
{"text":"Dinner 4-23. Had shrimp cocktail, house salad, 10 Oz prime rib. Shrimp was tasty and cocktail suace was spicy and had a hint of mustard. House salad was ok. Too much ranch for my liking. Tried the ceasers salad and it was very anchovy. Prime was cooked exactly as ordered and came with a nice side of mashed potatoes. Would go here again. Really reminded me of old school vegas"}
{"text":"I had such a bad experience here.  Walking into the place I already had a bad vibe.  The host was very rude, no friendly greeting.  She brought us to a booth.  Waited at least 15 mins for a server to serve us water. He did not  say anything to us at all.  Poured water all over the table.  Then 5 mins later finally a server came to take our order.  This server comes to us and said \"What are you having\"  mind you, he did not introduce himself to us, did not apologize for us waiting so long. Then when we started to order our steak, we ordered the beefeater, medium rare. Medium rare steaks are a little bloody if some of you don't know that because the server assujmed we had no idea what medium rare steaks areHe had to ask us at least 3 times if we wanted our steak a little bloody. After  be walked away, I was so upset because eating at a decent steakhouse or at any restaurant, you would like to be treated with a little respect. These employees decided to treat us like crap because of how we dressed or how we looked like. Never will I set foot into that restaurant and I will never recommend that place."}
{"text":"Very good prime rib, decent price, and clean and quaintly atmosphere. The service is good yet a bit timely in bringing the food out yet it taste great so I guess you can't rush quality. Was not a 5 because though food was god the environment was missing something, just not warm for a 5."}
{"text":"It's off the strip- so be excited for more reasonable prices.  It's not anything over the top, but it's pretty good for what you pay.  You get a salad and a potato with your meal.  We got the prime rib of course, and I was really impressed with the au jus on the actual plate, as well as the horseradish.  They give you both prepared, and creamy so you can choose.  Also, they make the potato table side which I think is a nice touch.  For $28 in Vegas... it's totally worth it.  We'll be back, Vegas is our happy place.  :)"}
{"text":"Sorry this is a year late, but I had to share the photo's.  Both me and the wife really enjoyed our experience here and the food.  I started with a salad and wifey wanted to try the artichoke hearts.  We actually shared them, they came in a pair.  We were so devouring one, we almost forgot to take a pick.  Wifey never had them like this before and she loved it.  She used to think she didn't like artichokes!  The aioli was delicious and paired perfectly with the grilled artichokes.  My caesar salad was attractively composed and not over dressed and the veggies were all very fresh and crisp and the Parmesan twist was a nice touch, but I think they forgot the croutons, see pic, lol.  Faye-sy's rib was excellent, and perfectly cooked and the baked potato was huge!  I love how they wheel out your meal on a cart, your food covered to keep it warm, and your server will ask you how you want your potato dressed!  The works, of course!  lol  My chops were also excellent.  I love lamb, and they were perfectly medium done, with that lovely char crisp sear on the outside.    If we make it to Vegas again, we will make this a must stop.  Fine dinning for a casual price!"}
{"text":"Best deal for prime rib in Vegas. A hidden gem for sure. The beefeater is at least two meals so come hungry. The lamb chops are also excellent. Great service."}
{"text":"i gotta admit, i read the reviews and went anyway. i usually dont read the 4 and 5 star reviews, i read the 1 and 2's to see what they REALLY have problems with. so, i knew right away, dont order the stuffed mushrooms.someone mentioned they serve voss water, it's not voss....it's tap and served warm with no ice.  i ordered the creamed corn (saw too many foodtv people making it from scratch that i wanted some). it was canned corn with some crappy cream sauce and it was lukewarm at best. the salad was terrible. i mean, how do you mess up a salad? my sea bass was lackluster. not much flavor at all. the garlic mashed potatoes same thing....no flavor.....hey....ever hear of salt and pepper? it's good and goes on food! the service was above awful. took 15 minutes to get a server (although i did read in one review it took a while, and when they seated us, they said it would be a few minutes.....not 15)...she didnt' ask how our salads and soup were, and as soon as she served the dinner, pretty much before we had a bite, she asked how it was. not a place i would return to.....even if it's free. id rather cook at home than eat here."}
{"text":"Really liked this place - upstairs and out of the way from the Casino floor at the Orleans Hotel - see my review for the Orleans here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/orleans-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-2?hrid=vTE6wKknvjq_4Mf_crpTpQ  So back to this place - a bit smaller but able to handle groups pretty easily, fully stocked bar with great service   On the night I visited with my group of 10 people we were sat quickly on a Saturday night at 8pm - having a reservation helped though but they weren't so crowded that we were stuck waiting. Food service was quick and food was great - everyone in the group was happy.  Pricing is great as well and affordable - this is defiantly a place to come to eat"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed this use to be one of our favorite places, prices have gone up and quality has gone way down. It reminded me of Cafe Food at a much higher price. We got the Orleans cut 10 Oz prime rib hardly any flavor and  tough meat, the tempura vegetables were like drinking oil, the bread was not that fresh, the vinegrette dressing was like eating sugar it was so sweet. The Lobster tail I added on for $20 was mushy and butter came cold in a plastic cup. Service was OK, I will not return."}
{"text":"The Orleans is a fantastic casino to play slots to gamble in. No joke. But on to the food... one night while trying to avoid a buffet, we ended up here and having no expectations at all, the prime rib turned out to be a surprising find!  Skip the appetizers and go straight for the entrees with come with a house salad plus a baked potato or garlic mashed potatoes.  The Orleans cut is 10 oz and the Gamblers Cut is 14 oz.  They also have a gigantic 24 oz on the bone if you have a hearty appetite. Our server said the Gambler's Cut is the most popular.  Overall I thought the prime rib was tender and juicy  (au jus on the platter); they also give you a large side of horseradish which complements the meat. I don't know what 21-day aged prime rib tastes like?  But that is their claim! Their servers serve everything on a rolling cart with silver covered platters.  It is pretty old school, but it works.   Funny, but their Chambord berries and vanilla ice cream was a delicious dessert that was a large serving. There were a few servers helping our area and they were all pleasant and worked at a steady pace.   Every few mins we'd see a rolling cart go by and it seems they have system down.  If you're off strip and feel like prime rib, try this place out.  Don't drink their wine; gave me a slight headache, so it is prob the cheap kind in giant bottles. Otherwise, if you want another recommendation- they have a pretty darn good breakfast buffet in this casino for cheap!"}
{"text":"I always going to the prime rib loft when I am in Vegas for my annual bowling tournament. Prices are cheap, prime rib is always good and there is never a wait. It is very casual that you can go in shorts and sandals and they don't ever mind that we are really drunk and annoying."}
{"text":"Once each trip to Vegas I splurge for a really nice dinner.  Sometimes I get disappointed, not here,  I showed up just after opening and it wasn't very busy yet.  Not being a fan of prime rib I chose the Filet of beef Oscar ($25).  I always hesitate to order medium rare as many chefs under cook it and it takes a good piece of meat to pull it off.  My waitress convinced me it was ok to order it that way and I was very pleased with the result.  It included a salad, which I had with blue cheese dressing, and my choice of potato, I chose garlic mashed.  I also had a slice of one of the best pieces of cheesecake I have ever had (I think $7).  The only regret I have is the Kendall Jackson glass of wine, I should know better as I have never had a K-J wine I really liked.  A note: a \"glass\" of wine is really a third of a bottle carafe so it isn't really as expensive as it seems.  Not only was this a great meal, at $44 plus tax and tip it was relatively inexpensive for Vegas.  I noticed a good portion of the diners were locals."}
{"text":"The food was great and the staff was nice. The only thing is that our food took forever to come. We got there at 7pm and got our food at 8:30p and the restaurant wasn't even crowded."}
{"text":"Shockingly good for a restaurant not on the strip.  It's located in the Orleans Hotel, I think on Tropicana.  Its not far from the strip, right past In-N-Out for all you Hawaii peeps.  My bf tells me that this is the best place to eat prime rib.  He has a straight face.  I ponder this thought: I don't particularly like prime rib (quiet your gasps), but we go anyway.  He, of course, has the prime rib.  I have a slice, and it was great.  Very moist, cooked perfectly medium rare as we like it, and very tasty,  What a good choice.  I had some type of shrimp pasta thing - scampi, I think.  The flavor was good, but sauce was a little overpowering.  What did I expect?  It's a prime rib loft.  No stars deducted.  The salad that I had was phenomenal.  It was just a regular starter salad, but the dressing....OHhhhhh, it was a raspberry vinaigrette, and it was GOOD.    It's a relatively small restaurant, and it overlooks the rest of the casino.  Get it?  Loft.  The prices are very reasonable.  The service was good and employees were friendly.  No TV, so if you're betting on the game, don't eat until after."}
{"text":"When Friend #1 had a $25 food credit for one of the restaurants at The Orleans, Friend #2 and I picked this restaurant.  We were greeted warmly and seated immediately at a both.  The mellow and upscale ambience felt soothing, and our efficient server Donna took our orders as soon as warm rolls and butter hit the table.  Our shared appetizer came out fast, but started the meal off SO badly:  Lump Crab Stuffed Mushroom Caps ($12) - 5 deep fried balls served on inedible green leaves of some sort, on top of a bed of crispy rice noodles.  Dijon mustard, some kind of creamy sauce, and warm marinara came alongside.  Talk about an identity crisis!    The mushroom inside the thick fried coating hid under a ball of salty, dry crabmeat.  None of the sauces made any sense at all, nor did they taste good - alone or with the mushroom.  It was so awful that when I told the busser, he sent the manager over.  When I repeated to the manager how awful and dry the shrooms were, he looked down, picked up the plate with the remaining 2 mushrooms, and literally slunk away without a single word of apology or offer to take it off the bill or replace it with something else.  It was a very strange reaction, especially for a manager level person, and we were left pretty much speechless by his odd wordlessness.  When Donna came back with dinner salads for me and Friend #2 and a Jambalaya soup for Friend #1 (they came with our meals), she did apologize for the awful appetizer, which was the first proper acknowledgement we had for it.  Maybe DONNA should be the manager - as she had way better communication skills than their actual one.  Salads were basic - iceberg, red onion, sliced cucumber and diced tomatoes.  The soup of the day was the Jambalaya, which it didn't resemble in chunkiness, and the flavor was totally unimpressive to me.  Both came with a Cheez-It-tasting cracker that was mildly entertaining.  Dinner finally looked up when our entrees arrived:  Me: The Gambler's Cut ($19) - a 14 oz cut of prime rib, rare, with steamed green beans and carrot julienne instead of the mashed or baked potato choice.  My meat was perfectly rare, perfectly fatty, super juicy, flavorful without being overly salty, and the creamy horseradish that came with was great!  The veggies were good too - tender and skinny green beans, still al dente.  Friend #1: The Beefeater Cut ($25) - this 22 oz bone-in MONSTER was a gorgeous hunka meat!  Same meat as mine, only bigger!  My friend got a huge baked potato to go with, and Donna served him sour cream, butter, bacon bits and chives from her serving cart.  Friend #2: The Orleans Cut ($16) - my friend requested this 10 oz prime rib grilled, and Donna didn't bat one lash when taking her order.  It came out with nice grill marks, and still perfectly medium rare as she likes it.  Since we were rushing off to a show, we didn't have time for dessert.  But if I erase all memory of the stuffed mushroom appetizer, I would be open to returning for just the prime rib in the future - and definitely try their Bananas Foster dessert!"}
{"text":"Pretty much what we expected after reading reviews. Great Prime Rib w/au jus, potato, salad. Service can be a little weird with foreigners as servers. We mentioned special occasion with our reservation but nothing special done. No acknowledgement."}
{"text":"This is the first time we are trying this place.  So far so good.  We walked in without a reservation right when they open 5pm.  We were sat and our server had just clocked in.  We weren't told any specials because he came straight to the table to greet us and was not told about the specials for the evening.  To us it was okay because we are in the mood for prime rib.    We ordered the southwestern spring rolls.  They are very good.  It came with an avocado and chipotle sauce that was very tasty.  My boyfriend has a salad and I had the chicken orzo soup.  The salad is a salad, and the soup was good.    We both ordered the gamblers cut prime rib. Come from the Midwest, my expectations for prime rib in the west coast wasn't very high.  I would rate the prime rib 7/10. So it's above average.    Overall I'm pleased with my experience here."}
{"text":"I went here because the best restaurant in the Orleans, Canal Street, was closed for the holidays (!). I was pleasantly surprised. It was old-style Vegas. You go up these stairs to a loft area overlooking the casino. There was a mix-up on my reservation but it didn't matter since the place was empty at 9 pm the Monday before Christmas. I was seated in a comfortable booth.     I started out with a good martini, then a non-descript house salad with fresh warm rolls.  The main course was the \"Gamblers Cut\" 14 oz. prime rib, with a fresh grilled artichoke with lemon aioli dipping sauce, and  garlic mashed potatoes.  The beef, which I ordered medium rare, was thick, tender, and uniformly pink. The artichoke was grilled but still juicy, the potatoes suitably garlicky.  The meal was reasonably priced. I paid with player club points. Service was attentive but nonintrusive. Overall it was a relaxing experience before I hit the tables again."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I liked it when it was a dark and I like it now with the lighter, upbeat looking decor.  Since prime rib is only on the higher priced buffets, one must search it out at other restaurants.  The Prime Rib Loft fits the bill nicely.  Boyd sent me a food voucher good at four of their properties.  Prime Rib Loft came to mind immediately.  I made a reservation for 5:30 so I had plenty of time for dinner before going to a play at Las Vegas Little Theatre in Chinatown.  I was seated as soon as I arrived and I had a view of the entire restaurant.  At first, the place was very quiet.  Soon, as more people arrived, the energy level picked up and with it the sound but it was never a bother.  I wanted to get the four onion soup but when you get one of their prime rib meals, with it comes corn showier or house salad and either baked or au gratin potatoes.  It's odd you can';t substitute because both soups are the same price.  The option given to me by my server, Rudy, was that I could order the onion soup à la carte and then get a salad.  I didn't go for that.  Too much food.  I ordered the Orleans cut prime rib--their smallest at 10 ounces--the corn chowder, and the baked potato.  He asked me if I wanted it loaded and I said yes.  Butter, sour cream, bacon bits, and chives.  For dessert I got Oreo cookie cheesecake which isn't on their printed menu.  The menu says to look for their daily dessert cart special and this was it for the day I was there.  I was brought a small bread basket.  I was so glad they downsized the amount for one person.  There's nothing I dislike more than waste.  I can always ask for more.  My iced tea was brought quickly and was refilled often.  The corn chowder was blisteringly hot which is good and which was good.  I got some freshly ground pepper on top.  There was plenty of time to slowly eat the hot soup without being rushed with an early arrival of prime rib.  That just didn't happen.  Rudy kept an eye on me and put the prime rib order in at the right time.  I had ordered the rib the rarest they had.  It was rare and it was very tasty.  Before starting, there was a small show table side.  The baked potatoes are on a cart pushed to your table where your server puts in the items you selected.    The meal was very enjoyable and all plates were clean of food when I finished.  After Rudy gave me dessert choices and I picked the Oreo cookie cheesecake, he brought it to the table.  A good size serving and very tasty!  A very nice ending to a good meal.  Service was excellent while I was there.  The table was patrolled for empty sweetener packs and the staff was polite and helpful.  I will be back with or without Boyd food vouchers.  (People at Boyd--disregard that sentence!!!)"}
{"text":"We got there bout 15 mins b4 they were closing and they took us.  They only had medium well left for prime rib so 3 out of 4 of us got the T-bone steak instead. Maybe cuz it was closing time and they wanted us to eat and leave that they didn't cook the steak the way we asked which was medium rare. ALL of our steaks came out meduim. =( Comes with soup or salad and baked potato or garlic mash.  It's not the best steak but you get what you pay for. The side dishes of cream of corn and asparagus was pretty good.  I would only go back if i was staying at the hotel and didn't want to drive to some place else."}
{"text":"Love this little hidden gem! Good prime rib for really good prices!!!! A must go when in town."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner around 7:45pm on a Tuesday night. The place can hold a lot of people, sadly there wasn't a lot of people inside.  The corn chowder was really good, loads of flavor and not over salty. I ordered the Beefeater Cut $34(including tax). This 24oz. prime rib cut comes with the bone in. I felt they did a good job of cooking it to my liking (med-rare). However, maybe it was because of the size of the cut, the surface was very flavorful and then bland throughout."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night and there wasn't a wait at all. The wait staff was very good and attentive despite a couple tables of knuckleheads that were complaining (totally wanted something for free), I believe their names were Ivan and Abbey. All in all it was a great experience for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Stopped here after Viva 21. The hubby and I where starving decided to stop here for a late dinner. We both ordered the New Orleans cut with a baked potatoes and salad! So I really enjoyed my salad the ranch dressing was so delicious! We got our prime rib with a huge baked potato the waiter comes with cart with a lot of sides for your baked potato and asks what you would like in it. Which is amazing and easier than having to put them on your self! Anyway the prime rib was good but NOT the best that I've had had. I will definitely stop here again if I am in the area :)"}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas and you are looking for affordable prime rib, this is the place to go. The night I went they were thrown a major curve ball, but handled it the best they could. The food was pretty good."}
{"text":"I was not expecting a fab meal based on reviews but I was close and hungry. The restaurant was really nice and spacious with a great atmosphere. The staff was great, my server Donna seemed to go out of her way to make sure I was happy. The prime rib was VERY tender. Taste:  pretty good but the BEST part was the garlic mashed potatoes. They were amazing. Real taters but with great flavoring right down to the pieces (minuscule) of garlic. While not the perfectly aged prime rib (which I did not expect; I guess their 21 days should be more?) I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I've tried to find a \"steak house\" I like for many years. I've tried them all -Morton's, Ruth's, Fleming, some independents, and all the usuals. NONE even come close to Prime Rib Loft. And the crazy part is, I've been going to the Orleans Hotel for years and never even knew this place was upstairs. The wine, artichoke, salad, meat, garlic mashed, desserts, service - all the best I've found at a \"steak house\". The meat was flavorful and tender. And the fact that all the other things that go along with it were great too makes this place a real winner!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The bread was cold and they only gave us one cup of butter for 4 people to share. We had to ask 3 times for extra butter. The \"medium rare\" prime rib was mostly medium in the middle and was too tough to eat. The garlic mashed potatoes were not even hot when they came out and already had a stale film on the exterior. The service was appalling. I had to beg for refills and the check. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Zero stars... Horrible  bland food,  no appearance what  so ever  was not tasteful.  Server was extremely rude,  for our date night,  what a total waste of  $109.79.. I wish we had  played  slots with the  $ and we don't gamble.  Grade F.  Management clueless!!!"}
{"text":"In this evening planning slow and relaxing dinner. Had a dessert ordered as my app. It arrived just as I got summoned to other duty. But I did take time, sorta, to wolf it down. Bananas Foster. Was pretty good in fact. But had to cancel everything else ordered. Great service."}
{"text":"Juicy delicious Prime Rib at a reasonable price.  Didn't go for the ambiance, it's at The Orleans for goodness sakes!  Just go and savor the meat don't go for your friggin 50th wedding anniversary people!!"}
{"text":"Its an unpretentious but a step above a cafe restaurant. Booth seating, table cloth and lots of happy patrons. Entrees are served with corn chowder (lots of corn and ingredients over cream liquid) or salad doused in dressing. A plus for me, ask for dressing on the side if you're not like me. Long mini white garlic bread sticks and mini pretzel cigars with butter are openers. Special water is served here.  The prime rib of course was soft. Had an end cut and regular cut. Surprised how mild and lightly seasoned the meats were all around.   The salmon plate was a deceivingly large and thick cut of fish. Juicy. Tomato pilaf okay.  Service excellent. Desserts looked interesting and yummy, but we were too full. Glad to have tried the prime rib, but for me, the taste wasn't the super best. Also, it can get busy here so don't expect quick order and entree service. Its a take your time/enjoy and talk place."}
{"text":"Manager Craig and our waitress Donna went above and beyond great service!! The Loft is a MUST when in Vegas. Thank you Craig for such great service. I deffenitly will see you in July!!"}
{"text":"Great, affordable, romantic, reasonable priced restaurant. They have awesome cuts of Prime Rib aged and cooked to perfection. The appetizers were sexy and displayed masterfully. The dessert cart makes you want to save room just to try these beautiful works of art. If you are in the Vegas area this is a must try restraurant. You will be glad you stopped by. It is located in the New Orleans with free parking."}
{"text":"bunch of friends and i ate here, because the buffet JUST closed...anyways, this is was close - and though it was not what we were craving for, the prime rib was really good.  I wouldnt go again, well because, i would plan my trip better to make it to the buffet on time.. 8o)"}
{"text":"When you have prime rib in the name of your restaurant I have certain expectations going into it.  I tried the satay appetizer.  It was OK at best, dry and lacking flavor.  I ordered the medium cut prime rib cajun style.  It came out without the cajun seasoning, but that was quickly corrected.  The meat was done a little more than ordered, but not to the point it would dramatically affect the experience.  The meat was OK, not bad, not great.  The best part was the cajun seasoning.  It packed a lot of flavor and a nice kick.  Our server seemed overwhelmed and impatient.  He was short with us when we asked questions.  This is not a bad place, it just sets itself up for disappointment by including prime rib in the name."}
{"text":"The food here is actually really good...if the service could rise to acceptable I'd visit much more often. But it seems like every time I go the service heads downhill. Last night was horrible. Our (delicious!) grilled artichoke with lemon aioli appetizer came out and less than a minute later our salads were dropped. This was 30 minutes after we ordered...it seemed our salads were forgotten and nobody ever came close enough to our table for us to point this out. I think our server remembered when he brought out our appetizer. Entrees (which arrived about 45 minutes after our appetizer/salad course - with no sign of our waiter) were delicious. My husband had the filet Oscar, beef medallions topped with crab, asparagus and bearnaise sauce, and it was cooked perfectly. I had the top sirloin - very good. The garlic mashed potatoes are a favorite of ours and they didn't disappoint, especially with their yummy house gravy (you have to ask for it.)  We had a comp and we were paying the rest with a credit card. Our server insisted we fill out the credit card slip before he ran our card - he said to just subtract the amount of our comp. We did so, though it seemed like a weird way to pay at the end of a meal. He then returned to tell us we did the math wrong because we failed to subtract the amount of the tax that would come off with the comp. Seriously. It was ridiculous.  I used to really like this place, it was the first steak dinner my husband and I had in Vegas  - before we even moved here. The food is always yummy and the prices are very reasonable. The service, though, makes me question if I will ever return... Last night was simply awful."}
{"text":"Dry Aged Prime Rib!!! Very tasty and tender almost didn't need the knife. The blackened prime rib Cajun style was seasoned nicely without a huge puddle of Au Jus. Fresh shaved and creamy horseradish was hot. They had some nice sides and appetizers. Service was OK for drinks but there was a long wait in getting the bill trying to leave to catch the end of the NBA Finals. Overall I'd rate it a 3.75"}
{"text":"Reading reviews on this place made it seem like this was the best spot in Las Vegas to get a prime rib and lobster dinner. Well...  The prime rib was pretty well prepared. We got the 24oz cut, medium rare, and split it between two (and an eighth; he had two bites, and just drank champagne for the rest of the evening) people. It came out more as a medium, but that's close enough. The menu claimed that there was an $8 dish splitting fee, and they didn't charge us for that, but the fact that it was inscribed in the menu bothered me.  They didn't have an explicit combination platter, so we had to spend an additional $20 for an 8oz lobster tail!  1. That's expensive. I get that Las Vegas is a little speckle of a city in the middle of a giant desert, but still.  2. It came out as rubber. It was also seasoned, which is frankly not how you prep a lobster tail.  We left full, but not quite satisfied."}
{"text":"we have eaten here many times. We like to stay at the Orleans because we find the gambling more generous than other casinos on the Strip. We would not go back as many times as we have (over a dozen) if their food and service were not top notch.  I have ever had a bad meal here. I do usually order the smallest cut of Prime Rib, but my dining companions have ordered around the menu and have had no complaints. My only complaint?  I never have had room to try dessert!"}
{"text":"Several years ago we dined a few times at this restaurant and were not impressed, but I had points to burn and the current menu indicated 21-day, dry aged beef is now being served so we (actually I) decided to give it one more try - silly me.    Entrees include a choice of potato and salad with my wife choosing garlic mashed that were puree like and garlic-lite.  My baker with sour cream was better.  The salads were primarily iceberg lettuce that had been topped with diced tomatoes, a couple of olives and red onion tossed in for good measure and dressed with bottled blue cheese.    Though our slabs of cow were served medium rare as requested, it took a Herculean effort to just to cut them into bite sized pieces.  Our server seemed to be on auto pilot and never once stopped by to inquire if we need anything or had concerns.  This was proved to be by far the most disappointing meal of our entire 14 day vacation."}
{"text":"We had dinner here saturday night while staying at the Orleans for bowling. Service was spot on and the food was delicious! I ordered the gamblers cut and potato with everything. The prime rib was cooked perfectly, flavorful and tender! Nice size potato as well. My only small complaint was the tempura veggie appetizer still had a small bit of batter inside, maybe could have cooked a little longer. But all in all it was a good meal!"}
{"text":"In on business, and wanted a great steak.  A local took us here.    Amazing NY Strip for $19(?).  Also came with salad and garlic mashed potatoes (or Baked)!!  Two others in our party had the 10oz Prime Rib, and it looked great as well."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere were great. What wasn't so great was our server's attitude when we wanted to split the check. I've never had this issue before but she acted like our request was quite an imposition. She finally said she would take our cards if we write down what was to charged on each. Fine. Too bad she couldn't have said that nicely in the first place. I mean this is Vegas I've never had a problem with trying to give them my money before! It put a damper on what otherwise would have been a really  nice 50th bday celebration"}
{"text":"Four of us family members decided to eat out for Christmas and we chose Prime Rib Loft.  We did need to make reservations.  Nice restaurant,   Very friendly staff and our waitress was very attentive to our needs.  The prime rib was VERY tender, moist and tasty, not to mention we received ample portions.  Three of us chose the baked potato and it was very good.  I was impressed with the potato because it was not only tasty but it was actually cooked all the way through.  Prices are fair for the portions.  Try this place, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"If you like meat and potatoes, this place is for you. Good meat and sides for a decent price. The ambiance is calm and dark. It's in an area above and apart from the casino hustle-bustle. A good option for a romantic night out."}
{"text":"Yeah, there's no way that rib roast was \"prime\" nor was it \"aged in house for 21 days\". I think the middle cut is the best deal because a large portion of the 24 oz cut is bones.   For the price, these were two tough hunks of meat.   I was expecting to be blown away by it, but was not. It was a good meal, but we won't be back.   Cajun seasoning was good, but a tad overwhelming.   Baked potato was awesome. Apple pie was great.   We liked it but we didn't like it, like it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is now my absolute favorite prime rib place. My husband and I are visiting from Hawai'i and celebrated our anniversary by having dinner here.  Every staff member we encountered was wonderful. They were very professional and attentive to out needs.  The food was amazing. From the appetizers , to our 14oz prime rib was heavenly, and perfectly prepared. We had the sizzling apple caramel pie with vanilla bean ice cream for Dessert and it was so delish!"}
{"text":"5 years in a row & always an amazing meal!  Prime rib or New York steak cooked to perfection, yummy garlic mash potatoes, backed potato, asparagus & mushrooms....all excellent & even better when Donna is your server....she's our favorite & the best!!! See u again next year!!!"}
{"text":"I think the prime rib here is great an very good priced. You can get a 10-22 oz prime rib from 14-23$ I normally go for the gamblers cut which is about 14oz for 17$. They also have a cajun style prime rib that I don't care to much for. The baked potato are served with the toppings tableside. Everytime im in town I always make a trip here."}
{"text":"A highly enjoyable dining experience.  The food was prepared and presented perfectly.   Donna,  our server, is the consummate professional; we will ask for here again. Our party chose many different items from the menu, and all were well executed.   I highly recommend the Cotton Club cocktail."}
{"text":"Great  food. great atmosphere. lovely staff. I've been going to this place for years and it's always a good time. The prime rib is outstanding although this time it could have been hotter."}
{"text":"So mom and grandma in law wanted prime rib. The BF has been before and had a pretty good comped meal here so we head to the Loft instead of the usual buffets where they like to go.  The decor is dancing and musicians signatures and pictures on the wall. The food is rolled out onto carts so it has the very \"old world\", kinda dated way of doing things. It is a appropriate place to bring the parentals, grandparents, etc. I dunno, it just gave me that vibe and most of the other diners are older couples or middle adult groups.   Salad is pretty standard iceberg with some onions, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, but all the veggies were fresh and crisp. They serve warm bread and butter that were pretty decent with a crisp outside and doughy inside.  Prime rib is the game so we all grabbed that. I think the prime rib was good- mine was juicy, tender and the right amount of fat on the rim. I got garlic mashed potatoes for my side- good garlic flavor but not much else. It needed more butter to make it creamier and it wasn't seasoned, but nothing a little salt and pepper I added myself couldn't cure. We ordered a side of the broccoli with beer cheese sauce. The sauce was good, but for everyone they wanted the broccoli cooked more. I like my vegetables a bit more crisp so I ate it up. Veggies were a big complaint of the table- mom in law was specially bummed that there's no creamed spinach, but we all love it so it was a big hitch for us. I would think that's a pretty standard accompaniment for prime rib but they only had broccoli, creamed corn, or mushrooms. I would think creamed spinach would fly out more than corn if they switched them.   We got a bananas foster to share. Good flavors, but needs a lot more ice cream....most the ice cream was melted and not enough to go around to break up that strong, very sweet Foster's sauce.   Service was pretty decent...we got refills and were checked on. We didn't wait on food too long.    I get why people like this place. Is it the absolute best prime rib available in Vegas? No, but you can't beat $14-22 for a slab with potato and soup/salad.  I feel you get good quality for your buck. It probably is one the better prime rib you can get in this price range and the best that Vegas has will be double the price. 4 people for $88 bucks is not bad at all. I don't know if this would be some place I'd go to that often...normally I would just go up a notch and get the best, but it was nice to try this. I left satisfied enough for what we paid and I guess that's what matters."}
{"text":"Old and tired a throw back to a day long gone by.  Needs an update to the decor and the menu/chef desperately. Servers and staff were great. Food was meh at best. Started with the artichoke crab dip appetizer. Came out quickly and with with only enough bread for about a third of the dip.  Had to ask twice for additional bread.  Hubby and I both had a salad.  Came with a entire slice of raw onion.  Inedible no reason to be on the salad. Cucumbers were not peeled,came with skin on, bitter....I had the 10oz cut of prime rib and added the lobster tail and chose the baked potato.  The beef was a bit over cooked for medium rare and not hot.  True to that cut of beef, very fatty and seasoned with large pieces of cracked pepper which made it incredibly terrible to eat if you bit into one.  The epic fail was the lobster tail.  It was so over cooked and was not one but two very small tails. Bottom line for $130 meal head to Lawry's where they specialize in prime rib and seem to have it figured out."}
{"text":"This is one of the best-kept secrets in Vegas if you're looking for your protein fix on a budget. My ex and I would always come in here and order the same thing- the 24 oz. cajun style bone-in prime rib TO SPLIT... for $24. And the kicker? Aside from the requisite bread basket (which was just OK) It normally comes with potato of choice (baked w/ all the fixings or french fries), vegetable and horseradish + side salad but every time we went and ordered it to split, they would split the potato between us, still give us a ton of fixings, AND give us our own side salads! Very nice service too.   The salads and potato aren't out of the ordinary, but they are simple, complete and done well, and the ambience is \"upscale casual\" (not even exactly dressy) but for the price (at about a little over $24 for the meal, we both just had iced water) we each got 12 oz. of meltingly tender, juicy, deliciously seasoned prime rib, a good size portion of potato and our own side salads. Count the excellent service and the white linen to boot, and it's a delicious steal of a meal. I recommend anyone try ordering it this way and they won't be disappointed... not for the price, anyway!"}
{"text":"It gets 1 star because at least the meat was decent. But the server Ivan and his busser Carmen are the worst service I have had in Vegas. We are never coming back here. There are plenty of other places where the service won't spoil your meal."}
{"text":"Nice new surprise! Upstairs in the orleans. Big portions so hubby & I split as no where to put leftovers in hotel. Manager can by to check on everyone & Make good conversation. Tasted GREAT but server never smiled"}
{"text":"So it's no Lawrys, for for less than $20 for prime rib, you can't go wrong.  I heard about this place from my cousin, and we all decided to try it.  It's off the strip, at The Orleans, but it's pretty good for it's price.  If you don't mind driving,  I'd reccomend it to people, and I'd probably go there again.  The service was very good and the wait staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Shame on you yelpers! I came off of recommendations on yelp that said it was the best prime rib in Vegas.  If that's the best prime rib you've eaten in Vegas, I'm sorry.    The ambiance is nice, a bit dated, but it made me feel all grown up sitting at the fancy tables with the waiters bringing out plates with domes on top.  Nice touch.  But that's where the impressiveness ends.  The prime rib was fine.  Only a touch better than buffet prime rib.  The mashed potatoes were yum, but sadly we were only given one measly scoop.  I wanted more!  Anyway, I guess you can't expect much more for the price, huh? I'll shell out the extra dough next time for a quality piece of meat."}
{"text":"under $20 meals...decent prime rib...and cajun style is pretty good...located inside the orleans hotel....if you happen to be unlucky like me and end up staying at the orleans..it's worth a visit to this restaurant..."}
{"text":"Buffet quality prime rib shouldn't have a loft named after it.  My friend ordered hers rare and we ordered ours medium rare.  It all came cooked the same.  Shrimp cocktails are skimpy and overpriced $14. Place has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"The 32 oz. med rare and a bottle of wine are great choice here. Delicious n great price. We love going here. Service always delightful"}
{"text":"This review is long time coming. My husband I i eat here at least once a month. We went for New Year's Eve dinner last night and it was fabulous. The prime rib (English cut) was cooked to Perfection-like butter.  Artichoke appetizer was spot on.  My husband had the Creole Tenderloins tips and said the dish was great.  We've had in the past tempura vegetables and cauliflower bites which were yummy. I highly recommend this restaurant.  Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Def. not for kids! The menu is fairly small but food was decent. Prime rib was good and the baked potato was awesome! Also had the chicken pasta and that was pretty good. Great pace to go before the Hockey game!"}
{"text":"don't be fooled by the Off Strip location, inside an old fogies casino, the Orleans.this was a winner. i did good finding this place.  came by for the boys steak dinner for March Madness. staying at the Rio but took the Gold Coast shuttle to here. very nice way to save cab money.  located at the far end of the casino floor, it's situated a top the floor with a great view of the gaming. surprisingly not busy during MM and spring break. got seated rather quickly and had the drinks coming shortly thereafter. the staff were very attentive and pleasant. the layout of the place is very classic, red velvet teeming from most parts of the restaurant.  very fair price for the bottle of Merlot that we ordered. even better pricing for the menu selections. i ordered the Beefeater. i wasn't messing around. at $27 for 24oz, it is a STEAL! almost half the price of Lawry's. i had initially thought that the quality would be sacrificed because of the price. boy, was i wrong. that cut of meat, on the bone, with the au jus was PERFECT. PERFECT i said! sooo mother effing good. i asked for green bean subsitution so as to make more room for the meat monolith. i ordered it medium and it was juicy and tender. they provide complimentary sourcream and horseradish which totally excentuates the flavors of the prime rib. damn, i can still taste it.  the boys loved their food as well. before i had a chance to mention it, a couple of my buddies already said that we're DEFINITELY coming back next year! and we will. YOU need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is a cafeteria disguised as a nice restaurant! So disappointed!!!! To begin with, the presentation of the food is awful! It looks better at McDonald's!  My friend ordered the prime rib and ordered the potato gratin as a side... It was simply slapped on some plate and looked like regurgitation rather than actual potato gratin. It also tasted pretty bland and was just awful. The prime rib was just OK. The salmon was just OK and overcooked. The rice with tomato sauce, which also looked extremely unappetizing, was absolutely terrible and, while I'm at it, cold!Very underwhelmed. Will not likely be going back here. We are going to see a movie and decided to get dessert at the movie theater instead of the restaurant. Definitely overpriced and bill for two people for just ordering The prime rib and salmon was $61 with no alcohol yet just water. Big thumbs down. So not going back. The good: our server was nice and the restaurant looks nice... Until you taste the food."}
{"text":"We love prime rib. That is one of the main reasons we visit Vegas. We had a free room at The Orleans so we visited this lovely loft just before closing on a Monday night.  The server was super nice and attentive. The meal was wonderful and the decor was from the old restaurant that had been there. I think it was an Italian place at one time.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Prime Rib Loft in the Orleans Casino Hotel was our dinner selection tonight. A few tables overlook the casino with s great view of the huge Mardi Gras masks. Nice booths are by the perimeter of the space.  There were several cuts if Prime Rib  to choose from. We had an 8 oz cut and a 14 is cut. Prime rib was cooked perfectly  and served with a salad or corn chowder and a baked or A'Gratin  potato. The baked was much better with generous toppings for the long added potato. A'Gratin was under cooked and overall not flavorful.  The salads were crisp and fresh comprised of s nice variety of lettuces, tomatoes, cucumber slices, Onion strings, as olives.  Nice dressing selections. We chose blue cheese which was nice and not overpowering.  Our waiter was very efficient and rushed.   The hostess staff was somewhat rude. We had reservation but it did not seem to Matter. We asked for a table by the window and were told it was unavailable due to waitstaff. There must have been 20 tables and booths. Around the restaurant. But we were told to wait. Finally I asked about the table and we were shown to the booth. The hostess told us she had to wait to seat us when waitstaff was available The hostess and assistant were not welcoming but The food was worth the wait n"}
{"text":"New look! Gone is the dark dungeon feel, walls are bright white. New carpet and gone are the fake foliage. And finally, a new menu. They have removed a few entre items like my favorite, filet Oscar and seafood appetizer.   They still have prime rib and it's still your choice of cut, seasoning (blackening) temperature.   But sides are now a choice of side salad or soup(no more lobster bisque) and baked potato ( no longer mashed).   Simpler choices, still good food. I had gamblers cut, medium rare. It was cooked perfect, side of horseradish. Baked potato fully loaded and corn soup. Servive was excellent and staff very attentive. Good place to come with friends and family or enjoy prime rib with the hubby!"}
{"text":"The prime rib was excellent. But although three of us ordered it, the waiter only asked two of us if we desired horse radish. The potato au gratin was dry and sticky. The dinner salad was nice. But the shrimp scampi was the worst. Tasteless with over done shrimp."}
{"text":"Wife and I had the prime rib two nights ago, and the meat was absolute perfection  The newly renovated room is very nice,  good salad, tasty corn chowder, but the main event was that prime rib. We both agreed we have never had a more perfect prime ever.  If their consistancy can remain high, this will definately be our \"go to\" place to take friends for prime rib."}
{"text":"We met family here and it was a most wonderful dinner. Food was tasty and staff was super friendly! we will come again"}
{"text":"Great value.  Good food at a rwasonable price. Prime rib is good. I would stay away from the soup of thw day. It is tgw same soup serced in the cafe with a healthier price tag.   The prime rib is excellent. The sea bass is good. It comes breaded in panko crumbs and sesame seed with an Asian themes sweet and sour sauce. I would recommend telling the server to have it broiled with butter and lemon. The fish is  good enough to stand on its own.  The baked potatoes are dressed table side which is a nice twist. You are able to control the amount of toppings.  The wine list could be better. But the wines they do have are grossly over priced, even by steakhouse standards. ($25 for a $5 Moscato. For the wife not me.)"}
{"text":"I just was not impressed this time food was good but felt like our server wanted us in and out! It felt to me like she just did not want to be there. Plates got taken away to fast I was never asked if I was finished and bang my plate was gone. Good deal for staying at the Orleans but next time I am here I will try another Steak house it was a bit lack luster for my taste! I wish I knew our waitresses name. Our dinner was this past Sunday 04/13/2014 just not great!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We always come here when win a little, as we always stay at the Orleans.  They just remodeled, and we brought friends who had never been to the Orleans. We were all impressed. Service from Lorenzo was top notch and the prime rib was so delicious! Comes with a salad and potato for like $26 bucks. Definitely worth trying if you want a fancy dinner."}
{"text":"We enjoy staying at the Orleans, we stayed there for the first time during Viva Las Vegas, and during that visit we discovered The Prime Rib Loft. We recently went back during the Kitchen and Bath Expo around Jan 15th and decided to stay at the Orleans, and have a nice quiet dinner at the Loft. We absolutely love it. For less than 100$ we had Rib Eye, bone in, Steak and Lobster and a bottle of Kendal Jackson Reserve Cab, along with Cesar Salad, and a table side made baked potato. It was awesome. The service was fantastic, our server was Saul, I would ask to sit in his station again. Accommodating but not intrusive, very well done. We were able to enjoy a relaxing meal, and have a little romance as well. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a wonderful dinner and a little ambiance as well."}
{"text":"Everything was very good. I suggest the Cajun prime rib. You can get the seasoning on any cut a prime rib you get.. prices were very reasonable and the food was very comparable to much higher priced places in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Had the Orleans cut prime rib with the Caesar salad and mashed potatoes. There was nothing special about the salad, but the rest of the meal was good. The potatoes were phenomenal and the service was good. The price was good for the food also. My friend said his prime rib was a little dry, but mine was great"}
{"text":"Great stuff...good prime rib! We were hungry and didn't want anything to do with the Mexican food below! LOL!   One gripe..I ordered my prime rib med rare...they served it medium. It was a bit dry.   Check out the cream corn, the prime rib and salad wasn't too bad. The bread sucked. Service good.  BTW....hostess asked us if we had reservations. Plenty of seating...and she still had to pencil us in with full name before she could seat us."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get steak and prime rib. Craig the manager is a guy that really pays attention to detail. This guy really makes the place awesome and makes you feel like you're the only people there. Our waitress Donna also did a great job and was very friendly and attentive to our table. The food was delicious and cooked exactly the way we ordered it. We will definitely be going back there every time we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Adequate prime rib...someone recommended me the sesame crusted sea bass. Normally I dislike cooked fish,cept Chinese steamed. But it is amazing....drafting this between bites!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The service is very good. The décor is nice. The only problem is the noise level. We could barely carry on a conversation during dinner. We had a 5:30 reservation on a Wednesday night, and once the restaurant filled up it got LOUD. The other patrons were just plain loud. And it wasn't just one unruly table. Maybe it's a case of contagion, where everybody starts talking louder to compensate for the people around them (I know that we had to).....but the noise level gave the place all the ambience of a cafeteria.  All of our roast beef was more rare than we ordered.  We figured that they had heard \"too well done\" too often and made decision to err to the rare.....at least that's easily corrected."}
{"text":"SO reasonably priced!  Definitely not the BEST prime rib in Vegas, but dude, for $14 bucks, a 10-oz. piece of this prime rib is worth it to me.  I've gotten 16-oz. pieces for like $30 bucks and it was of similar quality to the Loft's.    We started off with the prime rib skewers with cheddar-beer sauce and I really liked it.  Tender pieces of prime rib and cheesy goodness, how can you resist?  You get a choice of soup or salad with your prime rib, and the BF got the cream of asparagus soup while I got a salad with ranch dressing.  I really liked his soup--a little smoky, and very light and tasty.  My salad was typical, but they overloaded it with too much dressing.  ASK FOR THE DRESSING ON THE SIDE!!  We both got the garlic mashed potatoes as a side, and they were also really good.  You can see the roasted garlic swirled throughout, and of course we ate those parts first!    As for dessert, we got the chocolate fondue.  It was thicker than what I was hoping for (they just melt chocolate chips....) but it wasn't horrible.  They give you cheesecake, pound cake, melon (weird), pineapple, strawberries, and bananas (I may have missed one thing in there).  I would definitely choose something else next time.  Overall, a great place to eat at if you want a multi-course meal for cheap."}
{"text":"Old school, old school, old school!!! When in Vegas you have to have at least one old school steak dinner and this is the place to do it. I found this place over a decade ago when attending a concert at The Orleans. It was so good... prime rib like velvet... and the service and ambiance was like a wonderful step back in time I return EVERY visit to Vegas (which is a couple times a year) as a matter of fact it's my tradition no matter who I'm with or why we are in LV to dine here our first night in town.  The tableside potato prep and the chilled bottled water just adds to the experience. I always get the prime rib and I'm never disappointed. I have dined here with a variety of people who have ordered a variety of entree options and all have agreed they have nothing to complain about just compliments.  I can't help but mention the cost.... I don't mind at all any amount of money for a memorable meal BUT if you can get a great memorable meal for a fraction of the cost of the celebrity steakhouses on the strip  and you aren't walking away still hungry this place is a fantastic value. Menu items are cheaper than some big box stores that aren't nearly as good and certainly don't have the old school vibe.  Though the Orleans is off the strip sister casino resorts on the strip offer a free shuttle or a taxi ride is only about 6-8$ The casino is older but still large and very lively so an after dinner stroll through the casino and maybe funky NOLA inspired cocktail before or after a nice dinner really rounds your visit out and makes the trek off the strip worth it!!"}
{"text":"I'd give it a 4.5 Dinner 1/25/10 The Prime Rib Loft is up on the second floor.  It is a good sized open room with one end overlooking the casino floor.  The walls are painted with cabaret-nightclub scenes. We did not have reservations, but it was not very busy, but hey, it was 6:30 pm on a Monday evening.  This is still a pretty casual restaurant, so both of us felt comfortable wearing jeans.  We had a nice booth.  Service was excellent.  Hubby had the Bourbon Street Chicken, which he said was excellent.  He's not a big chicken fan either, but trying to follow Dr's orders somewhat.  I had the Filet of Beef Oscar.  Cooked perfectly and to die for.  So enjoyable.  Very, very good meal, but be aware - the garlic mashed potatoes SCREAM with garlic - too much for us.  The baked potato would have been a better choice for us.  $50.00 (excluding tip) for the two of us including a Bud & glass of White Zinfindel.  Ended up kinda funny neither of us ordered Prime Rib for which the restaurant is known for.......Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here.  We ordered the fried asparagus to start, and the dipping sauce was very flavorful. Make sure to give the asparagus time to cool.  They brought out my corn chowder, which was very creamy, and the wife got a salad.   The bread that cake out was good, a couple of breadsticks and some pretzel buns.  I ordered the \"gamblers cut\" prime rib which is 14 oz.  and the wife got the \"the Orleans cut\" (10 oz.) I was happy with the cuts, I only wish the beef was a tad juicier.  The service was excellent, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Great meal and affordable in Las Vegas. Located in the Orleans hotel. 4 of us with the 10 oz prime ribs. Including baked potato or ogratten potato Includes a salad and a $45 bottle of wine was only $155.  Very flavorful and filling.   Would highly recommend unless you was to dine on the strip and pay over 2× As much."}
{"text":"On a second dinner outing here with friends I was impressed by the great quality of the meaty and tasty House Shrimp Cocktail we were served with very good Cocktail Sauce; great-tasting and creamy Cream of Tomato Soup; and fine Dinner Salad with sliced tomatoes, Red Onions, lettuce, cucumbers, Black Olives, and Bleu Cheese Dressing.  Then I enjoyed an entree of a thin but fine pan-fried Filet of Beef Oscar with crab meat, drinkable Bearnaise Sauce, and a complimentary savory Brown Sauce.  Sauteed Mushroom Caps and a fine big Baked Potato with butter, chives, and bacon rounded out a really fine meal.  I also liked the Pretzel Bread but was just not enamored with the not real doughy-tasting rolls.  Except for having to ask for a water refill and more butter, service was very good, and our booth was quite comfortable.  There was little room remaining for dessert.  Another XXXX-1/2 star meal here!"}
{"text":"Let's get down to business! This is one of my top favorite restaurants in Las Vegas no doubt. The flavor burst in my mouth with each bite of the succulent cajun spices smothered over prime rib excites me beyond belief, I should have really had a towel to sit on, eh hem....really a jean soaking experience to me lol. I always order the cajun style prime rib, nothing like it around I must say! This is another restaurant where in my experience during my meal I am once again finding myself moaning without control.  This place is great, my complete meal runs $14 bucks, a slab of cajun style prime rib, soup or salad and choice of side, giant baked, or roasted garlic mashed taters! A steal of a deal for such awesome flavor! Plus pre-meal bread is provided to snack on! Also ice cold complimentary imported bottled water served tableside wine style! A nice classy touch :) So is a good time to get your fill of water! Afterall your skin and kidney's are counting on you! They have the freshest salad you will ever have the opportunity to stuff in your mouth! A killer Ranch dressing I just can't keep my composure when I am finger licking my bowl, every last drop! This is no lie!  This place is dark and romantic and is located upstairs overlooking the casino. A great place for a fun date, really anytime!   The Prime Rib Loft is primed for hearty appetites! The restaurant's comfortable and attractive ambience combines with its reasonably priced, superb menu to make this specialty dining room a must during every visit to The Orleans. True to its name, the Prime Rib Loft is famous for its delectable cuts of prime rib - the Orleans, English Cut, Cajun Style and the Real Beefeater Cut (an extra thick double cut with bone)- all specially selected and dry aged to ensure tenderness, then seasoned and slowly roasted for incredible flavor. All prime rib selections are served with a giant baked potato AND your choice of bacon bits, butter, sour cream and chives. More favorites include additional beef dishes, chicken, seafood and pasta. Begin and end your meal with fabulous appetizers and scrumptious desserts.  Hours Sunday - Thursday      5:00pm - 10:00pm   Friday & Saturday      5:00pm - 11:00pm"}
{"text":"Took my mother here for her birthday dinner as it is pretty hard to find a steakhouse that has prime rib that's not too far off the strip. My New York steak came out medium well and extremely charred when I had ordered medium. Server immediately apologized and offered to get me a new one. My mother got the New Orleans prime rib which she absolutely loved. Our server was awesome!"}
{"text":"The prices are great. Staff is wonderful. Atmosphere is very relaxing. I love this place it is the second time I have been here and each time I get the Cajun style beef eater which is absolutely wonderful. My wife feels the same and swears by the steaks. I've already told at least 6 of my friends about this place five stars to this restaurant along with the casino that is awesome"}
{"text":"The GF was in the mood for primerib and I figured a place with prime rib in its name has to serve great prime rib but she wasnt impressed. Complained it wasnt cooked the way she ordered it. That didnt stop her from wolfing it down and looking at my plate though.  I had the steak medallions and they WERE top notch. Cooked to a perfect medium rare. We split the stuffed mushrooms and they were great.  A rather robust couple well over 3bills each ordered prime rib at the table next to us and when their food came out the server asked if they needed anything else and in the greatest hick voice they asked for ketchup, mayo and A1 sauce. The server was so confused! At a  place like this one the chefs earn their reputation and you are going to ask for ketchup mayo and a1 for prime rib?   We laughed about it all night!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Randomly ended up here one night and now it will be a usual. Rudy our server did not skip a beat. He took amazing care of us. All the staff was great and the prime rib was perfect!"}
{"text":"No thanks to our server, we will be back.  The food was very good.  Although my husband did regret getting the super large size prime rib (he orders it medium rare, and it came out pretty cold).  I had the sea bass, and it was quite good.  Next time, I will ask to have the sauce on the side though.  It had a nice flavor, but masked the taste of the fish.  Our server....was awful.  We ordered appetizers that never arrived, because he forgot to put them in.  He was not attentive to refills, nor did he come back to check on how our food was, etc.  Also, when we ordered dessert, my sister got hers first, and had to start eating it (because it had ice cream).  She was completely done and my husband and I hadn't received ours yet.  The busser was quite attentive, definitely filling in where the server was lacking, and was given a separate cash tip handed to him, as we very much appreciated his service.  Our server only got 10% - sorry, but if you provide bad service, your tip will go down accordingly.  Then he had the nerve to complain to the manager about his low tip, within our earshot.  We went over and informed the manager of exactly WHY his tip was so low.  Again, despite the poor server, we will be back.  We just hope José isn't our server again, and if he is, we will request a different one."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend with several friends and we were staying just down the road from the Orleans.  Made reservations for Saturday evening and of course, as soon as we arrived, we were seated right away.  I ordered the Caesar Salad and the English Cut of the Prime Rib.  Everything was just outstanding and the next time I'm in the area, I will be sure to drop by for dinner."}
{"text":"Good service. Their prime rib taste good and I like their side (Meshed potato) so much! And I also like their soup as well! The beefeater cut is the greatest deal ever!!!! $28 for 24oz!!!!"}
{"text":"Aloha everyone let me throw this disclaimer out before you read any further:  This place is in a Sam Boyd casino so temper your expectations for a 5 star dining experience. I have nothing against Sam Boyd casinos I just want to be real about it.   When you walk into the Loft, you feel like you are walking into a spendy michelin rated restaurant BUT it's classic looks are deceiving... You are walking into an classy cafeteria.   The good Can't beat the price. At $29.99 for a large cut prime rib meal it's a great deal.   The meh: The bread was hard and a bit stale. I'm not a snob but serving warm bread is almost an expectation when \"dining fancy.\"  The food presentation was very room service-esque. All of the entrees came with service lids pulled at the table.  Props to the tableside baked potato dressing.. I think that this is one of the few places that still does this...    At $29.99 for a large cut of prime rib, it does the job. It's the little things that detract from the experience."}
{"text":"our luck was not as good as other,  service was just okay i can say it better then a good buffet so was there food!!  the prime rib was not cook to expectation   i don't think i want to try then again  good luck"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem when it comes to prime rib! I always order the 24 oz bone in prime rib, cooked to medium rare with mash potatoes...and sides of asparagus and mushrooms. $28 for the 24 oz prime rib is a bargain....and delicious to boot! I also order a bottle of their Mondavi house Cabernet wine (under $20) to wash down my meal. The final outcome to this great meal is...there is never any room left for dessert! I always bring out of towners here to eat when it comes to prime rib. A hidden gem of prime ribs!!!"}
{"text":"Always nice service. Food is great and very well priced. Mouth watering meals. I've loved going to this establishment each and every time."}
