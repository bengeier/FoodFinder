{"text":"Nous avons unanimement trouve ce Resto ordinaire. Rien qui vaut le déplacement à tout prix. Nous avons eu en entre le fondant  qui était pas très bon et gris...on aurait pu épargner et éviter ce plat. La pizza à une belle croûte tendre et délicate. La sauce un peu fade..."}
{"text":"Lovedddd this!!! Just when we sat, the waiter welcomed us as first timers and told us we'd be eating the best pizza we ever had! Turns out he was pretty damn right! The pizza they serve there was veryyy good and fresh and perfect, definetly comparable to other pizzerias we tried in MTL!  Service was awesome, food was DE-LISH, and the ambiance was...as if we were in a movie set (candles everywhere, small restaurant, cozy music, italian floor tiles, pasta maker, tomato cans)! And the music was not too loud so we could easily hear each other. It turned out to be a pretty romantic thursday night. Im pretty glad we went there instead of Vinni Gambini for pizza! And since we live a few minutes away, we will be back; for sure!!"}
{"text":"An excellent pizza for those who appreciate a real delicate Italian pizza.  If you're looking for a thick american style greasy pie, you're at the wrong place.  Having tried the margherita pizza (which is one should always start with to determine the quality of a pizza), I was pleasantly surprised.  The tomato sauce was balanced and the dough had a perfect texture.  The fiore di latte cheese covering the pizza was fresh and tasty.  Prices were extremely fair considering the quality.  We started with a butcher tray as well as a mozzarella and tomato plater which were both ok.  We ended the meal with a Nutella pizza, which I would not hesitate ordering again.  It's hard to find a really good pizza... This place offers just that... I'm going back!  Only downside - the limited menu (not many appetizers or other dishes besides pizza) - which is often a good thing, since they can focus on what really matters... the pizza!"}
{"text":"Yuck!  Terrible and watery sauce, bad cheese and crust with an off-putting flavor.  Skip."}
