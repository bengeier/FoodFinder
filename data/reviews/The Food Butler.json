{"text":"I've used The Food Butler a few times over the the past few weeks and have to say that its pretty great. Everything arrives quickly and the couriers have been very courteous. I will definitely be using them again."}
{"text":"This delivery service is absolutely FANTASTIC. Food arrives quickly and hot. I am disabled and unable to drive. It is great to have a service that delivers something besides pizza. The drivers are extremely courteous. I would recommend this service to anyone who lives in their delivery area. I would also recommend them to any restaurant that would like to start offering delivery service. You won't be sorry"}
{"text":"It's nice to be able to have something besides pizza delivered. I got an estimated delivery time of 45 minutes, the actual time was closer to an hour, but I didn't have to pick it up so ....  The delivery guy was very nice and our order was correct! I hope more restaurants join Food Butler and they stay in business. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Service was quick and good! Driver forgot my 2 liter owner called to let me know and had driver bring food and go back and bring it all the way back with and extra and the owner offered me free delivery with my next order. I wasn't expecting anything more than for him to bring the 2 liter back. Awesome customer service! Will definitely use them again"}
{"text":"They have limited restaurants and the one we ordered from they called 35 mins later to tell us they stopped working with them. Every time we used them, they made a mistake. Not worth it. All the restaurants have pick up. Do it yourself."}
