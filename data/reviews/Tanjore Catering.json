{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here. It beats the fast food burger place across the street for flavour and taste for the price - plus it's a small local business.

I ordered a meat dish with two veggie dishes, rice, naan, and a small salad/chutney type side for six bucks! The food was hot, fresh and tasted great.

My meat dish was the curry chicken, and the other meat dish they offered was a goat curry. Both of these meat dishes have bones in them, as is normal in most traditional Southeast Asia dishes (the bone marrow adds to the flavour and add vitamins/nurtients into the dish).

My veggie dishes were two paneer types and they tasted awesome.

They do not do buffet meals and primarily cater to the take-out crowd. There is a small seating area in this restaurant with television showing programs geared toward the ethnic style of the restaurant.

I haven't ordered takeout here but it's somethig that I will try in the future."}
{"text":"this place is great, the parantha are freshly made. for the price you are really getting your money's worth"}
{"text":"I'm not ashamed to admit that I could probably eat here multiple times a week (and actually have...)

I've had catered meals (butter chicken - mmmM!) from Tanjore for office/work parties and have individually ordered the thalis many, many times. The thalis are great value for your money. Both the veggie and meat options are solid. You get a fair selection of items (rice with either three vegetable dishes, or rice with one meat and two vegetables. Both come with a large, fresh-outta-the-oven naan as well as a little mixed salad/pickle mix) I always get the rice with curry chicken and either lentils and mixed veg, or saag paneer. The only downside is Rakesh (the friendly owner) doesn't always have the saag which is my fave veggie dish :-(

Like others have mentioned, this isn't really sit-down friendly (just one little spot in the corner), so I always walk-in, and grab my thali to go. He takes debit/credit/cash, which is great for people like me who run on plastic.

The wait for food isn't usually very long, but if you do have to wait a bit, I suggest placing your order and then waiting around outside so you don't end up smelling too heavily of Indian food. It is a very small restaurant, so I find it gets a little stuffy inside.

This is totally a little family run place with great meal options, particularly for students and people wanting a full tummy on a thin wallet. I love that Rakesh remembers you once you've gone a few times and has always been consistent with both the quality and the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall with one folding table and a few chairs. You definitely don't come for the ambiance. 

You can't see the store from the street. It's near the corner or Markham and Lawrence, in the red brick plaza next to the Tim Horton's. 

They have ready made food that was ok, the chicken curry was super tender. Wanted butter chicken and garlic naan but since they're made fresh after you order, the owner/cook/cashier said it would take at least 20 minutes wait time. He must have seen the hunger and disappointment in my eyes because he said he was in the middle of cooking butter chicken for a customer that was arriving later, so he could give me that and start up another batch for the one coming later WOOHOO!

I left with a thali lunch special, butter chicken and complimentary butter naan since he didn't have any garlic naan available. The butter chicken was a tad overcooked and the sauce sweet but there was something in it that was so addicting! I was doing my happy food dance while dipping the soft buttered naan in the sweet and savoury sauce.

Sweet owner who's willing to bend over backwards to accommodate his customers is truly a treasure for us foodies. I will definitely be back to try more of his cooking but will call my order in ahead so I can try his specialties hot and fresh and not sitting around lukewarm."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about this place. I usually don't eat cultural food besides my own but this place is amazing. Most of the time I buy the vegetarian meal. The veggies, rice, chick peas and of course the nan. The owner makes it quick and its always fresh."}
{"text":"It was okay. Had the chicken tikka masala n garlic naan.  Garlic naan was the strangest looking garlic naan I have ever seen. It was a little smaller and thinner than average but that's okay.

I must give this place extra points for including the most meat in a curry that I have ever seen in an Indian takeout restaurant.  You know most places give you like 4 pieces of meat in a huge saucy curry dish!!! What is that???? 1 chicken chunk per person? lol

This place is located behind the Money Mart on the northwest corner of Markham and Lawrence in Scarborough.

After all this, I didn't think it was tasty enough to return. My parents liked it tho

Thumbs up for being halaal !  Two different staff confirmed it."}
{"text":"The take-away thali is cheap and delicious. Butter chicken is fabulous! Very, very limited seating."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday. I have tried the biryani, channa masala, butter chicken, palace naan, mattar paneer, pani puri, chutney and they are all great. The marinated onions are spicy, my #1 favourite side and I have never had these at any other restaurant. They have a new location a few units down from the original with ample seating and it is very spacious."}
