{"text":"Great service, the food is awesome. Meat is so tender, every type.  My only wish is that they made homemade pita bread that would be a five star for me! Still love you guys!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite late night takeout spot. The food is always fresh and light and very flavorful. My go-to dishes are the hummus and the fattoush, but there are many more delicious options. Ya Hala has a very unique drink made from layered, crushed fruit, pistachios, and fresh cream. Delicious and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Great little place to have some seriously good shawarma. Something this area has been lacking as the ones I have tried I have not loved. This place was a great value for the amount of food and the quality of food. Had chicken  shawarma with rice and hummus. Everything was delicious.   This place also has hookah available."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good prices. Plenty of parking. Definite feeling of being family run - grandma may have to shout into the kitchen to get your waiter to reappear. Quaint, crude, worth a try."}
{"text":"Best shisha hands down, especially because of their outdoor seating. The food is good too"}
{"text":"Really good family run Mediterranean place. It's a bit informal setting but food is amazing. Love the grill meats. And desserts were clearly fresh made from family recipe (not too sweet). I believe there was hookah available too though I do not order those."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place as the name 'Ya Hala' reminded me of a restaurant in Dubai I used to frequent with my family as a child and I thought they opened a location here, that too a 5-10 minute drive from my place. Unreal!!! The place is literally unreal...you walk into what looks like a diner, a few kids running around the place (family run establishment), the food itself we found was very lame for authentic Middle Eastern food, too much of North American influence (perhaps due to location in the Clarkson/Port Credit area?). Very bland food and with equally bland attitude from staff.  I must return to the real deal in Karama! This is a knockoff version :("}
