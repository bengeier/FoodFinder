{"text":"The previous reviewer got this spot-on.  I mean, who WOULDN'T want to go to the UN-friendly neighborhood bar?  Oh, wait.  EVERYBODY.  The BF and I are new to the DeFo area, and looking for a local hangout.  Upon entering The Landmark, we immediately learned a helpful tip that I am happy to pass along to you: don't try to start a conversation with the bartender/owner, because his personality seems to be a curious mix of hung-over crocodile and rubber spatula.  My conclusion is that he must be independently wealthy:  I'm guessing that the geriatric regulars are not the highest tipping bunch, but how DARE new people walk through his hallowed doorway?!"}
{"text":"We came here on a trip from out of town and we were so pleased with it! The staff greeted us immediately and explained how the ordering process worked. The menu had good variety and the items were reasonably priced. Our food was served promptly and was delicious! I had the grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken was cooked well and was paired with delicious sauce. I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to try Landmark on w117 th and Clifton for the first time. Very friendly and helpful staff. I had the fried chicken it was very good. We we were with a group of six so I got to try the Mac and cheese with the brisket, that was awesome. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other choices on the menu. Definitely in the rotation."}
{"text":"This great new restaurant is right at the corner of Clifton and 117th where the old Clifton Diner was. The food is fresh and pretty and it's a great place to pop in for a quick meal. You order at the counter and they bring you your food, so if you feel pressure when ordering, take a look at it before you go in, but their menu is pretty small, so it shouldn't be too hard. We went with a group of 7 and got a table together easily. Everyone was happy with their meals. I definitely recommend the burger, the fried chicken and the bowls. And the goat cheese ball salad. Ok, I recommend everything. If you eat with your eyes like I do, follow them on Instagram for a comprehensive look at all their menu items: Landmark_Cleveland"}
{"text":"I'll give nearly any business a second chance, but after two of the worst experiences that I've ever had, I am done with this location.  There are plenty of businesses that want your patronage, unfortunately the Landmark us not one of them."}
{"text":"Really good food. Nice area since the new stuff went in across the street. We used to eat here when it was the diner. Food prices went up bu so did the quality. The fries are amazing"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Food is fresh and nicely presented. Their smoked meat sandwich is equal to if not better than Schwartz's Deli in Montreal!!!!  Can't wait for brunch"}
{"text":"Doing everything right at this joint. Meats are on point, especially the Montreal Smokes Meat which made for best Reuben I've ever had. Had pretty much everything on the menu so far and have enjoyed every bit of it. Sides are not to be forgotten as the Mac n Cheese deserves an award."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon for the Bloody Mary bar that they advertised outside. We were greeted immediately with a smile and ordered our drinks.  The Bloody Mary bar was simple, pretty much what I would expect from your local tavern.  They had all you needed to make the perfect drink with beef sticks, pickles, and olives included. You also got a chaser with it. I finished my chaser fairly quickly and the bartender filled it back up - no charge! That was a nice gesture. All and all, it was a good experience and we will be back. It was good priced as well, two bloody Mary's with chasers and all the sides was $9.50.  There was also free, fresh popcorn!"}
{"text":"Expensive food. No service. Nice space. Decent food. I will wait to they figure it out before I return. Looking forward to breakfast I will admit."}
{"text":"Their fried chicken is among the best I've had and the Mac n cheese was delicious too! Great decor, huge upgrade from the old space, and a cool casual concept for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Look...I know BBQ is in and getting poorly overdone by absentee celebrity chefs to rave reviews by People who don't know about BBQ....and I gather Landmark is trying to be something else other than BBQ, which they also do well HOWEVER, their brisket will make you wanna slap the sandwich out your mammas mouth. If you're wondering what that means, it's a amazing!  Slaw slightly oniony but I couldn't stop eating it.   Lastly...that f'ing house made hot sauce...what wasn't used to dip slather and smoosh was slurped down at the end. It isn't too hot and has a sweet note that was unexpected and addicting . If they don't bottle that liquor soon I'm gonna break in and steal that shit"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch. Try the spinach and feta cheese omelette. It can be busy but very much worth going to."}
{"text":"Great place,great food, great neighborhood!  Don't miss the fried chicken dinner, the Salmon dinner, the bowls, THE REUBEN, ok,try it all...can't wait for breakfast to begin...(seems like early July ?)...wasn't sure about the concept at first, but they have won me over. ..easy to catch a great meal in a limited time. Wonderful addition to the neighborhood! ****(Also, tipping isn't necessary when you order, just a convenience. ..entire staff, including kitchen staff  shares in any gratuity. ..kind of an amazing concept for everyone to share in the rewards! )****"}
{"text":"Skip this place until you are eligible for SSI retirement benefits. The curmudgeon bartender is almost pissed to have new patronage, and is as talkative as a telephone post. Plus it's overpriced and closed by 8"}
{"text":"Great dinner but on the fence with value. Mac and cheese was delicious. The portion was a good size. Osso Bucco also great. I was disappointed that you ordered at the register and then sat down. This is getting too common for restaurants, has the feel of we want you to pay our staff with tips and they not actually provide a service. At this price point, $40 for a meal, $3 a soda...someone should be waiting on me."}
