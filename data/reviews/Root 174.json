{"text":"After wanting to check out this place for a while, a friend and I decided to check it out during PGH Restaurant week - we were not disappointed.  After being seated, we checked out the menu - my friend ordered the restaurant week special (brussels sprout appetizer, trout, desert) and I opted for the duck testicles and cassoulet (pork belly, chicken hearts, oxtail). The brussels sprouts and duck testicles arrived - the duck was good - nice flavor and something I would consider ordering again even though it is a little out there - but the brussels sprouts were from another planet. I don't know exactly what they did, but it almost seemed like they had a general tso's flavor to them - I would recommend them to anyone.   Mains arrived right after we were finished with appetizers - perfectly timed - the cassoulet was great - balanced flavors and the pork belly in it just fell apart. The trout was light, flavorful - I would consider ordering both again.   We tried the flour-less chocolate cake with the beet ice-cream for desert - the chocolate was rich, but not overly sweet and the beet ice-cream was good.  The service was great the entire time - attentive but not too much.   Overall, great experience and this place will be added to my list of places in the city that I would happily return to..."}
{"text":"Pretentious servers and host, drafty and uncomfortable environment, \"good\" food that is way overpriced for being 1. In Pittsburgh, 2. In Regent Square.  Not a bad restaurant by any means but not worth the money at all.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Root 174 is probably my favorite place to eat! I am lucky that this is so close to me. Will the GM is awesome! He is also super friendly, fun to talk to, excited about everything on the menu, and loves mountain bikes. I always feel so welcomed by him.  I took my cousin there Saturday night and again it did not disappoint. She loved everything about it. They are definitely farm to table, putting together the freshest ingredients that compliment each bite.  We split four apps (brussel sprouts coated with bacon pepper jelly, grilled romaine with cornbread croutons and a chipotle Caesar dressing, bone marrow brûlée, and the beets special) all of it incredible.  Will was very helpful in pairing a white wine for us to compliment our food choices. We then split the skillet chicken, with mole sauce, grape tomato salsa, and grits.  Amazing!!! My cousin follows a gluten free diet and they had no problem making substitutions for her that absolutely did not compromise any of the delicious flavors.  I don't eat out that often and when I do I usually end up at Root, because I am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food should ALWAYS be this good! The apps were bomb (pork belly and dates, omg the dates) and my lamb dish was out of this world succulent and so so tasty. They have a unique selection of cocktails, which are wonderfully made, and great dessert options, flourless chocolate cake (w/espresso ice cream, and Nutella mousse & homemade whip cream) & lavenda/lemon cake! I loved every single bit of my meal and will definitely stop again! Also, why isn't this place more popular? Yeah it's pricey but so worth the price tag, given the portion and high quality of food! Love!"}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week and loved our meal! Not much to update from my previous review, but we just really enjoyed our meal and especially to desert. I was so stuffed by the time our dessert came, but I still ate it all.   Port terrine: pretty good, I could've used a little more of the mustard. But, that's personal preference, as I love mustard. A good combination of relishes, to accompany the terrine.  Pork belly and scallops: good flavors, again in the sides/relishes that accompanied the pork belly and the scallops. The pork belly was a little bit on the dryer side, I think it was supposed to be more of a crispy style. But still, yummy and the scallops are cooked very well.  Japanese cheesecake with lavender, lemon curd, and pistachio: The cheesecake was just so light, almost fluffy. But, still creamy like cheesecake. And, I love the tartness of the lemon curd.  I want to go there every day and order this!"}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best food in Pittsburgh. I have now visited twice, and I can't tell you how wonderful the food is. We had bone marrow creme brulee (to die for) and brussel sprouts as appetizers. The ribeye, duck sausage, and squid ink pasta were all delicious. Everything on the menu looks good. It is worth the money, and I don't usually say that. Visit this place - but make a reservation. Oh, the beer selection is small but good. Haven't had any wine or cocktails.   The one negative is that there is not a lot of seating, and most seats are along the two benches on either side of the room. Otherwise, a perfect experience."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty. The cocktails were good, but a little bit sweet for my taste. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Started with the bone marrow creme brulee which is too perfect to miss discussing as well as eating. The creamy, meaty butter was less gamey than I expected more like a greasy butter with maybe a hint of whip cream and sweetness. Spread it on the bread and accompany with tastes of the tiny acidic apple salad. Great for the table to share.  Mushroom salad - winter salad including cremini mushrooms with lentils that were perfectly cooked a small bit of greens and a fried (but not greasy) egg on top. This would have a been a great meal by itself! The egg could have been cooked a touch less so some of the yolk would run over the salad but I would guess that the chef is catering to those who don't like runny egg. I was surprised to see salt and pepper on the table and did use a little sprinkle here as I like salt. I actually appreciate that the chef can allow the diners to adjust the salt to their own tastes as we all have different ones.  Trout taco - very interesting as the fried trout fillets were lightly coated with cornmeal (masa?) and fried and served as the taco shell. The lettuce and chopped salsa served on top with crabmeat were the filling. All was over a black bean puree with traditional Mexican flavors centered on cumin. This is a taco to eat with a fork. The bean, trout and topping were tasty. I especially liked the crisp corn flavor on the trout. The crab was a little lost although good it was unnecessary to my taste. I didn't like the skin still on the fillet as it added a bit of texture I didn't enjoy.  Falafel - these were the winner of the night for me. I would like to go back right now and have them again. Three perfectly fried but not greasy golf-ball sized falafels were filled not with the dry flour-y chickpea bread like the kind I make at home but with a hummus-like cream with some small chunks of vegetables. I enjoyed them with the Israeli carrot couscous that was so mild in flavor (most of the flavors in all the dishes were milder than I expected) I could not detect carrot, a yogurt sauce with chopped onion and cucumber, a spicy yet not hot harissa, and dry chopped black olives. It was fun to try the falafel with each of the accompaniments in turn and then do it again.  Brussels Sprouts - I almost forgot to mention these little babies! A large side dish to share was brimming with dark fried sprouts rolling around in a bacon-y sweet sauce at the bottom. I love sprouts and these were a lovely example with no hint of bitterness which makes me think they were very fresh as well as cooked to softness but not overstewed. I didn't even need the sauce they were so yummy.  PB&J cheesecake - perfect. The peanut butter, a powder (?) sprinkled on the cheesecake, and the jelly, a thin grape sauce under the cheesecake, were subtle which allowed the pure enjoyment of the traditional cheesecake tasting of tangy heavy cream and the bread-like slices of ideal angel food pound cake. Not too sweet.  Service - excellent.  Atmosphere - others have described the environment. I think it is fine and doesn't detract from the experience because of course I was there for the food. It is not a fancy, dressed-to-impress decor. Dress for the temperature. It is a small room and on this wintry night the cold air came in the door every time it opened.  BYOB. Open on Sundays now. Don't miss it! I predict this will be on the best list in 2012!"}
{"text":"Root 174 is definitely a solid restaurant with creative dishes and plenty of variety for the meat lovers and vegans alike. As much as I'd hate to say it, I just wasn't that satisfied or impressed with it. I had the opportunity to eat there during the first week it was open and it was AMAZING. I had their fried chicken special, which was juicy and delicious. The skin was nice and crispy and it really delivered on flavor.   I was just waiting for a chance to go back and that finally happened this week with one of my friends. Unfortunately it just wasn't as good as I remembered. We started off with the bone marrow creme brûlée and the crispy brussel sprouts. The bone marrow had a great texture but it tasted bland to me, it just wasn't very exciting. The brussel sprouts, however, was probably the best thing part of the entire meal. They were lightly fried and covered in a black pepper and bacon jam. The jam was not overpowered by the black pepper at all but gave a nice richness to the brussel sprouts. I LOVED IT!   Next we split 2 entrees, the first dish was the special of the night which was a pork shank with a white bean puree with some type of root vegetable and the second dish was the falafel dish. The falafel was light and crispy but I think I was just expecting more flavor wise. Again, nothing was bad...I was just a little bored. The pork shank was very tender but overall the dish was very heavy and felt like it needed something to cut through the richness.  Although the desserts on the chalkboard seemed pretty generic, the waitress gave us a more detailed description that definitely peaked our interest. They all sounded amazing but we decided on the chocolate espresso cake. The cake was dense, but dry. The flavors were there on this one, but the execution feel apart somewhere. Aside from that the staff was very helpful and friendly. Unfortunately due to the small space and close tables I was barely able to hear my friend speak. Based on the exceptional reviews and my first experience I might have just built it up in my head...I think I screwed myself on this one because I left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying loud and clear:  ROOT 174 is EXCELLENT!!!!  It has been a long time since I've dined in Pittsburgh and truly enjoyed (and felt impressed) by the food.  We went on a Saturday evening around 9 pm.   Details on the Appetizers:  YUMMY!  The Brussels Sprout  appetizer is so unbelievably good, there was not a drop left to lick off of the plate.  This is a must have!  The beet salad was enjoyable, nice an light but full of flavor.  The mussels were fresh and delicious and a little spicy.  Super yummy.   The grilled salad was also very good.   Details on the Main Meals: GOOD!   I had the trout:  it was very good, overall the dish lacked a little pizzazz in my opinion but was fresh and very enjoyable.     My date had the meat selection, I forget what is was exactly but some sort of steak.  It was very tasty and good.  It came sliced so it wasn't hot - that would be my only complaint.   My friend had the scallops - they were delicious.    Her date had some Chinese calamari sausage special item that was so so unique and good.    Now, my only wish is that they would put some music on - this place needs some Cafe Del Mar or Buddha Bar or something subtly hip.  There was no music at all while we were there which I find unfortunate. Also, I wish there had been tea lights on the tables - romance it up a bit!  Overall, excellent and I highly recommend going for dinner."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight.  Nice ambiance; excellent service; friendly Chef;  the food was outstanding--tasty, artful presentation; and just the right amount.  It does not get better than this  Frank"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that has us perplexed.  It has great reviews and had come highly recommended.  The fact that it is within two miles of our home made us feel like we had been out of the loop for not getting here sooner.  Regardless, we will most likely never return.  Based on the basic criteria of ambiance, food quality and service, here's why (based on a scale  of 1-10):  Ambiance (4) 1.  We arrived at 6:30, the first to be seated.  We were given the first little two top right in front of the door.  Very little regard was given to how awkward this was to us as customers.  There were no other people in the small space.  Don't get me wrong...we love an intimate dining environment.  However, this was way off and was very uncomfortable.  The fact that our table was uneven and rocked, making it necessary to stuff some sort of implement under it to keep it from spilling our drinks was annoying.  You can forgive that in some dive diner, but not here.  Unfortunately for Root, this allowed us to view some of the less than attractive elements of this small space.   2.  A variety of attention to details or lack thereof...fire extinguisher pulled from the wall and sitting on the floor, acoustic panels all uneven, pvc pipe up the wall covering a/c conduit, strangely uncomfortable plywood booth like seating that was lower than the chairs accompanying them at the table.  It all made for an awkward visual and gave an overwhelming sense that the details are ignored. 3.  It's an eclectic menu, Mediterranean paint on the walls, Victorian tile on the ceiling (the best and most interesting part of the decor) and Rap music...??  At this point, it was all very confusing.  Food quality:  quality of ingredients (7-8), preparation (5) 1.  The brussel sprouts were great.  There were confusing elements however.  We are curious why the sprouts were piping hot but the bacon/pancetta was cold.  Gave a sense that they had no relation to one another in their preparation.   2.  The bone marrow creme brûlée was pedestrian.  The top of the brulee was grainy and the contents were overworked.  If it were not for the little slaw on the side, it would have been a complete no-go.  That small amount of slaw added some acid and crunch.  Seemed like a good idea...not so much. 3.  The entrees were mixed.  We ordered the \"deconstructed\" pork \"taco\" and the chicken and waffles.   The pork taco was good.  The elements had some relation and came together nicely.  The chicken and waffles were confusing.  Separately, they all tasted nice but you couldn't stack it in one bite and get a cohesive flavor.   4.  Dessert/after dinner was a game changer.  We ordered the \"Reimagined pumpkin roll\" and the \"Toffee bread pudding\" and coffee.  (enter a long pause here.  see service, below).  The pumpkin roll items came out garnished with sprigs of dill (enough said).  The bread pudding was covered, slathered and covered some more with a thick caramel that tasted like Smuckers.  Gross.  The award winner was the coffee.  The cup was set in front of my husband with a small pool of \"just been washed\" funk water and the coffee (from a press that was rushed/pushed/poured on top.  It vaguely tasted like dill.  Maybe it was previously washed with other pumpkin roll dishes?  Service (4) 1.  Overly attentive at the beginning, bordering on pushy to order. 2.  Overly absent at the end.  Not very polished, somewhat condescending.  There was a lack of ease or comfort in the presentation of service.  It's a local, eclectic dining experience and not stuffy or overly pretentious.  However, there was a demeanor that was off.  If the details in service are adhered to, you can get away with that.  Not in this case, for sure. 3.  Gross neglect over the coffee situation.  In addition, when she removed our barely touched dessert plates, she did NOT even mention if everything had been okay.  Could not get out of there quicker.   Again, we are seriously confused!  Was it just an off night?  Would we have missed some of these details if we had been sat at say, 9:00pm, when it was more hustle and bustle?  I doubt it.  In such a small space, the devil is in the details.  A definite miss for us on all cylinders."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We had a group meet at Root 174 for a business dinner. We started with a round of appetizers, the mussels were my favorite. Chef Keith and his team created a culinary masterpiece for us. Every meal was near perfection. I had the gnocchi with pork belly carbonara style. This was one of best restaurant experiences I have had in years. I will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Say 4.8 stars. It's awesome and one of my fav's. BYOB is a huge plus -bring wine or get a 6 pack across the street. Creative....and something for meat lovers and vegies - which is fantastical.  Tables are close together so you can hear what everyone is talking about."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal at Root 174 for lunch. The chilled split pea soup was incredible. I ate the Root burger and it was fantastic. Finished with the lemon lavender cake and some commonplace coffee company coffee. There was nothing commonplace about either. Both the cake and coffee were delicious. Service was excellent. It was my second time here and both times the entire experience was excellent."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian - so now that we are done with that disclaimer we can move onto the review of the food.  It's a small place so things could get cozy. DW had the Lavender cocktail while I opted for the Corpse raiser. The drinks were OK - I've had better for $10 / $11 a pop. For appetizers we ordered the Falafel dish which turned out to be the best dish of the night. For entrees we had the vegan meatloaf and Cavatelli pasta. The meatloaf was a bit dry but nevertheless had flavor and texture. The pasta was probably the worst dish of the night.   So in summary not a good place for vegetarians."}
{"text":"For such a small restaurant, Root 174 has a rather large reputation.  With enough tables to seat no more than twenty people or so, you walk into pedestrian decor, pizza parlor tables, and a very bland-appearing bar.  The bar is stocked with the classic cookbooks, such as Modernist Cuisine and Julia Childs.  I had a good laugh thinking of the chefs, flipping through the books preparing the dish.  It'd be akin to surgeons flipping through an anatomy book in the OR!  The menu is seasonal - so my selections may not  be relevant in the future, but the food was excellent.  If the crispy brussel sprouts remain on for apps, it's a must-get.  They are crunchy, savory with bacon, and sweet with some honey(?),  The plate was gone in sixty seconds.  My counterpart did not want to venture into the land of bone marrow creme brulee, and we got the wedge salad - which was really good.  I'm not a big fan of salads as appetizers, but c'est la vie.  Entrees were a duck sausage with gnocchi and some ricotta.  The duck sausage was flat-out awesome.  The gnocchi was easily the best I've ever had.  I've heard the Top Chef critics describe perfect gnocchi as \"pillowy\" before, and now I know what they mean.  The gnocchi might as well have floated in my mouth.  The entire dish was a hit.  The pork belly was equally fantastic - although I would recommend that you get it as an appetizer for 4.  It's so flavorful and rich, four pieces may be too much for an entree.  Some of the sides, like a pickled relish, tend to get lost in the dish as well.  But, man, I am craving that pork belly right now.  Desert was a Nutella bread pudding, and a bit of a letdown.  The bread pudding was definitely average, and tasted more like stale french toast.  The raisins, nuts, and nutella, did bring some joy to the dish, but it paled in comparison with the apps and entrees.  Root 174 is a very casual environment, and certainly a foodies' delight.  It's a great find and well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh.  In fact it is my personal favorite.  The dishes are creative and delicious and the atmosphere is laid back and unpretenious.  I'm not going to go on and on about the place.  Just go."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!  Our bartender, Austin, works hard to ensure that everyone enjoys his or her drinks and adapts, if necessary.  I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I would give this additional stars if I had the option.  My husband and visited Pittsburgh for our anniversary 8/2/2014 and based on reviews we decided to have our special dinner at the restaurant Root 174. We couldn't decide from the tempting and unusual choices so we ordered the Tasting Menu with 6 courses, priced at $67/person. The waitress (she was superb; attentive, friendly, helpful and informative) cautioned us that we should not order this if we're at all picky or have allergies/aversions. We are foodies. We wanted the chef to enjoy himself and pull out all the stops, and we happily gave ourselves over to being surprised. This turned into a very generous assortment. I was expecting like one tiny bite of everything; not so.   Each course was delicious, and all different. I will not itemize each one here as there were so many and I honestly can't rate one over another, they were all that good. One conclusion we agree upon is that like a musical composition made up of component parts, each of these creations blended seemingly disparate ingredients in a completely harmonious way. Yet each part retained its own identity; you could really enjoy the ripeness of the fig appetizer whose sweetness contrasted by the creamy bleu cheese; the sharply vinegar white anchovies against the creamy-custard poached egg in the caesar salad; the perfectly tender mild octopus with the vibrant and spicy romesco...well, you get the idea. This is a tiny restaurant (seats only maybe 40), and nearly invisible to the passer-by. In fact, it was raining hard and we walked right by the entrance and missed it on the first pass; I guess we were trying to avoid puddles.   You gotta look for it. And it's SO worth the effort!! We both agreed that this is probably the most memorable dinner we've ever had, and we have visited many wonderful places. Keith Fuller is an artist, and this restaurant is a gem. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"While Root 174's food is beautiful and interesting, their flavors are only decent. The decor could be better and the wood-bench seating is uncomfortable.  Our drinks were great. I recommend the Pickle (?)--it tastes like a pickle and is made with cava--and the Root Remainder, which hints of root beer!  Our appetizers were decent. The texture of the crunchy, sweet corn in the watermelon, tomato, feta, and mint salad was very nice, although the watermelon could have been sweeter. The bone marrow creme brulee tasted of butter, and the bacon-pepper glaze on the brussel sprouts appetizer was amazing (anything soaked in that sweet glaze had better turn out well).  Our entrees were underwhelming. My companion's pork belly banh mi disappointed--the meat was too fatty, the duck liver mousse was an awkward and disgusting tasting addition. My roasted chicken breast with chickpeas, pistachio and tomato was overwhelmed by spice. The wagyu beef and flat iron steak dishes were good, but the potato, carrot, and onion side was too thick and heavy. Not one of us finished our entrees!  The highlight of our evening was dessert--unfortunately, it could not save this meal. The flourless chocolate cake with beet ice cream and the bread pudding with white chocolate powder and ground hazelnut were delicious.  Overall, our first meal at Root 174 was decent. However, at this price point, a better value and experience to be had can be found at Eleven, my standard for good American food in the city."}
{"text":"Our 3 or so experiences here have always been great, so we save up and haven't regretted it yet. The cocktails are to die for, and the food and service are consistently excellent. If they are on the menu, get the glazed brussels sprouts as a side to share. If you think you don't like them, but you like bacon, they will convert you..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous!  The food is so creative and delicious that you seriously don't want the meal to be over.  I've been there twice, once for lunch and once for dinner and I will say that it's WAY easier to get in for lunch.  But when we tried to get in for dinner and they were booked, the staff accommodated us at the bar.  It may be a little pricey but it's SO worth it!!  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that the cocktails are a little pricey but other than that, this place is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Not sure I agree with all the 5 stars. Visited for the third time yesterday. The first two was when the restaurant opened and again a month or so later. We decided to try again since the reviews were so stellar. I had the vegan restaurant week special offering. My husband ordered off the menu. Pork belly appetizer and duck breast. The vegan special started with a salad with large pieces of mushroom. Can't say I was fond of the dense rubbery texture of the mushrooms. The dressing very good. My main was house made pasta, vegan meatballs, and beets. This was delicious and I am not a vegan. My husbands meal was good. The pork belly appetizer was served with an interesting Rice Krispy treat like carb. My desert was celery sorbet with a peanut butter type cake but the sprinkling of raisins did not add anything to and possibly detracted from the lackluster dessert. The wine list by the bottle was quite reasonable.   So nothing bad to say and the prices were in line with other similar places, but the meal left me a little flat and not sure I will be back. Recently went to e2 for the first time and can't wait to revisit.  My husband's $.02: 4 stars"}
{"text":"This has become one of the best restraunts  in Pittsburgh. I had the Caesar salad and fish of the day.  The egg with Caesar was perfect.  I could have eaten a plateful of the oyster mushrooms with the fish.  Wow.  Try this place !"}
{"text":"I travel internationally and my lovely wife is a New York foodie.  We have been in Pgh for 14 years and Finally!!! we truly have an exceptional restaurant without pretense.    Without a doubt ,  this is a must do.   Better than eleven or nine on nine or soba......   The flavors, servers, plates .... Bravo!!  We used to live near hear and sadly moved away else would be here many nights.   Enjoy and experience."}
{"text":"Food and service was very good - we really enjoyed our food. Style was very creative. BYOB makes it a good value."}
{"text":"Too keep this simple and easy, this restaurant is amazing. It is tough to find but ohhh so worth the search. We were traveling through Pittsburgh and found this place via localeats.com. We simply threw a dart and took a chance on the adventure.  The food is simply amazing and having a open mind to the menu will yield a great reward. The scallops and pork belly along with the gnocchi was delicious. The homemade pasta and deserts were divine.  The cocktails lacked a little luster, but definitely nothing to subtract from the experience.   Please take a chance and check this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for Restaurant week with 3 other people, and out of all four of us I was the only one to get good food. Although I wish I could write a better review, 1/3 is not a passing grade.   We started off on a high note with the brussel sprouts that were delicious. I had the lamb neck that was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. However, the other two dishes at the table did not live up to the reviews. The restaurant week specials were a choice of trout or vegan meat balls. The trout was underseasoned with a very weak sauce. Although it looked pretty over some vegetables, all was bland which really took away from the integrity of the ingredients. The vegan meatballs were inedible, even for my friend who eats at vegan restaurants and cooks vegan entrees.   For dessert the flourless chocolate cake and beet ice cream left something to be desired. The ice cream was inedible and tasted something like a spicy canned beet. The flourless chocolate cake was average, but with a salty mousse did not wow anyone. I got the bread pudding which was dry, but redeemed by an excellent nutella mousse.   Would really love to give this place a better rating because I loved my food and the ambience, but after choosing this place only to have my friends hate it (for good reason- I tried their dishes) I would be embarassed to ever bring someone back."}
{"text":"Root 174's still trying to figure itself out in every way.. unacceptable at this price point  Rustic ambience with Old Hollywood gold paint and red velvet cushions. Earthy brown tables are never more than 1/3 full during Wednesday's dinner \"rush\". The result is an awkwardly quiet restaurant on par with Babu Bhatt's restaurant on Seinfeld. Root could sit 34 but instead has as many patrons as workers.. 4-5.   Our awkward server made no effort to connect with us, not even eye contact. When asked \"how's the short rib\", he gave evocative adjectives like \"good.\" Literally said \"We can't make that\".. it's a fucking old fashioned and you served me a sazarac moments later. What cocktails they did serve were risk-less, simple, and sweet.  Mixed-quality food was largely in need of better spicing. The mushy dates had exceptionally earthy chorizo, a nice counterpart. The Indian-esque shrimp terrine needed salt but delivered in acid, earthy lentils as balance despite boring shrimp. Pesto dominated the lamb neck, which needed salt to help elevate the too-earthy carrots. The lamb itself was super juicy though. Juicy med-rare short rib was all over, large jalapeño slices dominating one forkful before the bitter taste of bok choy next. The promised kimchi made no appearance. And yes, in need of salt.  Best was definitely caeser salad, the only well-salted dish. Cavier and anchovy blend superbly alongside a nice crunch and excellent dressing.   You can mess up one of service, drinks, or food for this price. All 3 means \"not good\", or cue Babu.. \"very, very bad.\""}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Root 174. I thought the service was good, and the food was absolutely delicious, even the vegan dishes! I started with the vegan falafel complete with vegan tzatziki sauce. Very very good. My entree was also fabulous - I ordered the steak. Very accommodating of dairy allergy. Dessert was a vegan no bake cookie which was very good. I will certainly be returning.   Reservations are necessary as the place is quite small, although there is open seating outside."}
{"text":"Brought my parents there for mothers day and they were blown away. Excellent food and service. You can tell their heart is really in the food."}
{"text":"Unique menu, fantastic food, and friendly service. I've been there for brunch and dinner and both were great."}
{"text":"Simply divine. The braised lamb neck is out of this world rich in a great way. Brussels sprouts were so nice and sweet. The Cucumber soup was a new and different experience I am still pondering. But the real grand slam was the pork butt. Rice crispies and pop rocks?!? How did that work? I don't know but I'll never forget it. Plus good wait staff."}
{"text":"We loved our experience here. Our drinks were great, and the appetizers were very yummy but not so big that they took over the meal. I had coffee dusted chicken wings, or something along those lines, and they were amazing. We were lucky and got in without a reservation, but next time we will definitely plan ahead."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Everyone at our table - most of whom are insufferable foodies - loved their food. I have been there twice and both times great, so as far as I can tell, they are consistent. The only small complaints I have is that it gets loud - they should consider having a door to the kitchen so we didn't hear the dishwasher, etc. Also, you have to ask for bread - it would be nicer if they offered it. But besides those small things, I am thrilled to have this new awesome spot in the 'hood!"}
{"text":"Root 174 occupies the space in which Legume resided, so it has big shoes to fill. The interior has a slightly different layout, but there are still indoor and outdoor seating options. The service is good. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, and was only around when we wanted him to be.   The menu is creative. In addition to surf and turf, there are many options that will intrigue adventurous vegetarians and vegans. As good as the options seemed, unfortunately neither I nor my dinner companion were very impressed by the food that we ordered. The scallops and veggies that accompanied them were great. In contrast, our steaks, sides, cheese plate, and dessert were adequate, but not as outstanding as one would expect for dropping ~$45 per person on dinner. The steak was cooked to the right degree but seemed not as flavorful as it looked like it should be. The dessert was basically a sponge cake with some icing on top, and the cheeses were kind of bland.   I would recommend trying Root 174, especially if you have a vegetarian or vegan in your dinner party, but temper your expectations."}
{"text":"LOVE.   I was very sad to see legume leave Regent Square, but I was intrigued by the promise of Chef Keith Fuller taking over the space. I have not been disappointed, to say the least.   I have been several times now and my food crush on Chef Fuller only increases with every visit. Oh my, oh my. Chef Fuller loves meat, so much so that it is represented among his many tattoos. His business partner, however, is a vegan. I can't say for sure how much that influences Fuller's menu choices, but there are always vegetarian and vegan options on the menu, and they are NOT afterthoughts.   My first visit was in summer and I can still recite my entire meal from memory. It was a sticky August day and I ordered an herbed lemonade. When your beverage elicits positive expletives from you, you know your meal is off to a good start. Wow, was that good. Basil and mint bruised and soaked in hot water, cooled, strained, and blended with citrus juice it was a perfectly refreshing and delicious beginning to what would turn out to be a fabulous meal. I couldn't pass up the chilled watermelon soup which was also refreshing. A little vinegar added some excellent brightness to the cool sweet melon flavor. One of my dining companions had the grilled watermelon salad with sweet frisee and some salty kalamatas for contrast. I had checked out the menu on the door prior to our visit and was delighted beyond my ability to accurately convey to see mole sauce over vegan vegetable cakes served with roasted corn salsa and fingerling potatoes, so I knew what I was ordering before I walked in.  Already savoring my experience, thanks to the fabulous starters and just lovely service, my entree arrived. One bite, and I was in love with this restaurant. The mole was what mole should be--complex, savory, sweet, with flavors slowly surfacing and shifting. Fabulous hints of cinnamon and spice floating on a rich, savory chocolate-tinged background. Mmmm. I swooned.   Ok, I lied a little bit--I don't remember what I had for dessert. I remember it was good, but the excellence of the mole sort of overshadowed the experience.   I have been back several more times and plan to be back many more. Each time, I have had excellent, friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful service (always from Marie--she's great!) and wonderful menu options. It is a teeny place, so reservations are recommended, but don't assume you won't be able to walk in."}
{"text":"Really yummy, unique food.  Yes, it's expensive.  If you want big portions of decent food, Applebee's is right down the street.  The food here is creative and unlike anywhere else that I've eaten in Pittsburgh.    Despite the small space, I've never had an issue getting a seat here (and I never make reservations) unless they have a private party.  Although I do tend to be really lucky getting seats in busy restaurants.    I love the Devils Riding Horseback, brussel sprouts, all of the soups, and the pork belly dish with the pop rocks and rice krispies treats (yes, you read that right).  The also have different kinds of loose tea that they serve in a French press that you get two presses of (about 4 cups of tea)."}
{"text":"The hubster and I came to check out Root 174 almost a year and a half ago, when they had just opened. At the time, we didn't think that it was anything that special (except for those Brussels sprouts... mm mm good). We hadn't come back for quite a long time. Yet, we kept on hearing about Root 174 from our friends, so we decided to give them another try.  The brussels sprouts remain amazing. And, I think that the food really has potential. I had the skirt steak, and the hubster had tortilla soup and the vegan meatloaf. First, everything was incredibly salty. And I'm a savory type person, so when I say it's too salty, that's probably REALLY salty. We've mentioned this to some friends, and they say that they've never encountered this problem before at Root, so maybe we just got them on an off day.   The tortilla soup was almost like enchilada sauce. WAY too salty, although it could have been delicious. I really enjoyed the skirt steak... extremely tender, and very nicely paired with potatoes and brussels sprouts (I love that stuff). But again, really on the salty side, so much so that I did not finish the dish. My husband's vegan meatloaf was a revelation. Who knew that vegan food could be so tasty? I highly recommend trying it - the blend of salty and sweet flavors is quite exceptional.  The service was attentive, and it still gets pretty loud in there. But, an overall thumbs up from me, and we'll come back again."}
{"text":"I first ate at Root shortly after it opened and found it OK. I had no specific complaints, but no great desire to rush back either. Yesterday, we found ourselves in Regent Square about 10 PM and in need of dinner. While there are now quite a few places in the Burgh where one can get a meal at this time of night, we thought proximity was a significant benefit since were both very hungry. We now wish we had waited.  While I would not say this was the worst restaurant experience I have had, it's up there. A big problem was that they had run out a number of different dishes and wines. This would have been less a problem, but the selection of each is not large. In particular, they serve only about 5 reds and 5 whites, and they had run out of the most promising red, a Rioja. While the Gruner Veltliner I had was fine, the Bordeaux which my wife ordered was unrecognizable as such (and it was the last glass), and Zin I had was overripe and pruny.  Now on the to the food.  We were both moderately happy with our appetizers, though the mussels I ordered had too much stuff going on for the flavor to shine through. I wanted roast chicken, but they were out, so I ordered gnocchi with pork belly. The pork belly tasted fine if a bit salty, but the gnocchi were like sinkers. My reading of the menu suggests that the chef is trying way too hard to be different."}
{"text":"My sister and I were in Pittsburgh for the weekend, and we were looking for something relatively close to Kennywood. I found Root 174 on Yelp, and since the menu looked interesting we decided to give it a try.   We got there around 7:00 on Friday night, but luckily we got a table quickly. (The host asked if we had a reservation, which makes sense because this is not a big place.) It took a little while for the server to come take our drink orders. Since we were about to go on roller coasters all night, we opted not to have any booze; however, the cocktail, wine and beer lists were brief but interesting.  The crispy Brussels sprouts appetizer was a great choice- crispy but still tender, and sweet as well as smoky. I had the soup of the day, which was a tortilla soup. This was served tableside over corn, creme fraiche, and a chive oil. It was spicy but well-balanced, and just the thing for a chilly fall evening. I followed up with the squash salad, which had a peppery vinaigrette that worked well with the blue cheese and walnuts. The other entrees at the table were the house made chorizo with pasta, and the wagyu beef special. The chorizo was spicy and garlicky, which accompanied the pasta nicely. The beef was done to the chef's choice at a medium rare, and it was very tender and flavorful.  The only thing that we noticed were slight lapses in service- no appetizer plates were offered even though we were sharing the brussels sprouts, and it took a while for our server to come to the table to greet us. Certainly not a deal breaker, just things you come to expect at that price range. I would definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for years but I always forget about it. I finally made it and well, I am only regretting not coming sooner! I love the small, intimate atmosphere. We had to wait a bit for our table so the bartender gave us drinks on the house which was so nice. Every aspect of our meal was so good I literally wanted to eat it all over again. The wings are AMAZING and our entrees, wagyu steak and braised short rib, were so amazing I wanted to lick the plate. lol The servers were so nice and welcoming and I loved how the chef/owner came to almost every table to garnish our meals. Just amazing and I want to come every week!"}
{"text":"We popped into Root on a week night without a reservation. I was a little put off by a weird cocktail (which is appears most other yelpers loved...) but the food was on point. The Brussels sprouts were delicious as was the dessert. The effort that goes into the food and service was clear. I enjoyed my experience, and I know we will be sure to go again sometime soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a cozy gem in Regent Square. My husband and I made a reservation to dine there on our way to a Halloween party last weekend. We started with the Grilled Octopus and the Black Caviar Caeser salads. Both were delicious. I had the Tuna Bloodline Bolognese as my main course - it was the best thing I've tasted in recent memory! My husband also enjoyed his entree.  In addition to the fantastic food, our server was knowledgeable and helpful, and the pace of the meal was perfect. One of our restaurant pet peeves is when the server is rushing us through the meal, bringing the entree while we're still enjoying the appetizer, but here we felt welcomed to linger.   We'll definitely be back to try the tasting menu, which seems very reasonably priced considering the high quality ingredients throughout the menu. There were also some interesting-looking cocktails I have my eye on for next time."}
{"text":"Ate there a few weeks ago.  Still good food, but the shortcomings of the space were a bit more apparent.  We sat at the bar, and it really, really needs to be replaced: there's no overhang, so anyone sitting there has to jam their knees agains the bar to get close enough to drink or eat at it.  It's pretty, but it's poorly executed.  Again, the Home Depot storm door on a restaurant?  WTF?  Excusable a month or two after opening.  A year later?  Not so much.  I don't think they've plowed any of their revenue back into the space."}
{"text":"Must try their DESSERTS! They are just very creative with desserts! Of course, the food is amazing too, but the dessert just put them from a 4 start to a 5 star!  A small and simple restaurants, with interesting art work on the wall. I didn't have too much of an expectation coming in, but I did see all the good Yelp reviews. My fiance and I started with a couple of drinks, but they didn't actually wow me. It's good, but nothing out of the ordinary. My fiance order their last special entree of that day, the waygu beef with argula and blue chees I belive. And I got to say, it was just so tender and juicy that it makes me sad they don't have this item on their daily menu! And I ordered the pork belly bahn mi, which they put a very interesting twist to it compared to the normal vietnamese sandwiches I get. It's very flavorful and filling! Be warned, it's NOT an actual sandwich, if that's what you're expecting. Like pork belly? Then give this a try!  And then it's OMG Dessert time! I had my eyes on the dessert board the moment that I walked in! Their options are very creative! I had a hard time deciding what I want even though they only had three options haha! In the end I chose to go with the curry ice cream with coconut tapioca - definitely not the \"normal\" dessert I order at dinner tables. Be prepared for the strong flavor of curry!  wooooooooOOOO is how I felt when I took a bite. But when paired with the tapioca pudding, it's like fireworks in my mouth! LOVED IT! I am totally coming back again, for their food and DESSERTS~~"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service! Appetizers to die for... Thinking of having 2 deserts? Think again, get three!"}
{"text":"I had been dying to try this place for at least a year, so my friend and I bit the bullet and decided to go on a random weeknight. My expectations were definitely met, and maybe even exceeded! Upon walking in, you are immediately struck by the casualness of the place, yet it definitely has an elevated feel to it. It's dark, but not too dark, and the bar area is super approachable.  Our waiter was really knowledgeable about the menu, and she offered some really helpful suggestions. I often get bummed when I go into restaurants lately because I'm pregnant and can't enjoy any fun cocktails at the moment, but the waiter immediately offerered me a selection of San Pellegrino sodas when she realized I couldn't have any \"fun\" drinks. Blood orange is my absolute favorite flavor ever, so I was a happy camper.  We started with the brusels sprouts, which were outstanding. Everyone seems to be doing the brussels these days, but these were definitely unique and stood out among all the other brussels sprouts dishes out there. They were so crispy and delicious, yet didn't seem heavy or overwhelming. I would definitley recommend starting with these!  My friend ordered the pork belly carbonara with soft egg and fresh homemade gnocchi and I had the hanger steak, per our waiter's recommendation. My friend's dish was absolutely delicious, and the freshness of the gnocchi cut into the fattyness of the pork belly, which was really lovely. I'm not generally a huge pork belly person, but this was truly delicious. My own dish was so good I wish I could have licked the plate. I found enough self control to avoid doing this, but I was tempted! The steak was perfectly cooked to my liking, and the accompaniments really worked well with the dish, despite seeming a little out of place. The black sticky rice puree was salty, yet well-balanced, and the apricot puree blended really nicely with the creaminess of the creamed corn that nestled into the steak. Truly yum!!!  I was stuffed, but we still managed to share the bread pudding that was served with the most delicious nutella icecream and white chocolate shavings. All of the desserts looked delicious, and there aren't many places in Pittsburgh that do dessert this well.  Can't wait to go back and bring my husband and try some more delicious, simple and clean flavors. Root 174 is definitely one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh now."}
{"text":"I like the trend in restaurants that started some years ago and is now really taking off in Pittsburgh; namely, locally sourced produce and meat thoughtfully put together by people who are serious about food and willing to not only try new things, but return their kitchens to a time when most things (like pasta and bread) were made by hand. Throw in some fun and delicious cocktails, and you have Root 174.   We made an early dinner reservation for a Friday night, and, while the place was empty when we arrived, it was getting busier by the time we left. It's a small space, so reservations are recommended. Both the drink and dinner menus are brief, so choosing was a fairly quick affair for me. I had the Royal Oligarchy, a very good cocktail made with Remy Martin, Jim Beam Rye, St. Germain, house bitters and Cava (Spanish sparkling wine), served straight up and ungarnished. I tasted every element present in this drink, and enjoyed it thoroughly. Caesar salad is a favorite of mine, and their Black Caviar Caesar arrived to the table somewhat deconstructed, with the baby kale dressed, topped with a large crouton  and liberally sprinkled with parmesan, and the poached egg, anchovy and caviar off to the side. This is a very good salad, and the well balanced flavors in the dressing, as well as the egg and parmesan cheese crisp, somewhat mellowed the stronger flavors on the plate. For my main I chose the Tuna Bloodline Bolognese, the description of which (olive infused pappardelle, tomato, zucchini, poached fennel) I found very intriguing. I did ask the waiter about the whole tuna bloodline thing, and he explained that the dark red meat that cuts through a tuna steak is the bloodline, and they take that part and create the sauce with it. Interesting. This is obviously not a typical Bolognese sauce, and the tuna was either pureed or melted into the sauce, which was thick and tasted of, well, tuna. I'm not sure what else goes into this sauce, as it doesn't say on the menu. The other parts of the dish...pappardelle (either house made or hand made locally, but brilliant either way), zucchini, poached fennel and tomato, were all done perfectly. The sauce got a little heavy for me after awhile, and there was a lot of it on the plate, so I didn't finish it all...you really have to like the somewhat fishy taste of bloodline tuna to enjoy this dish. And I did enjoy it.   Dessert, a lemon and lavender infused cake, sounded simple, but was completely different than any cake I've ever had, both in texture and taste. French press coffee completed the meal. Everything I tried here was delicious, beautifully presented, and just a bit different from my expectations, which is a good thing. Service was low key and helpful. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here.  The place is small an intimate.  You feel like every table matters.  The food options seemed reasonably healthy and not too heavy (though the pork belly is not exactly light or healthy).  Some of my other favorites were heirloom tomatoes and beets.  The most interesting thing was a chocolate cake topped with a pistachio puree.  It literally led to the comment, someone threw up on the cake.  However it was the perfect blend of salty/sweet and oh so delicious."}
{"text":"After 6 years in Pittsburgh and hitting most of the 'hot spots,' I can say with confidence that this is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is creative and complex, the cocktails are fit for the season, and the ambiance is simple and pretty. My favorite dishes were the chickpea appetizer, the brussel sprouts with pork belly and the lamb neck entree. The brussel sprouts are far tastier than meat and potatoes' or butcher and the rye's. The lamb neck is an entree that my waitress suggested, which did not disappoint. It was 'fall off the bone' delicious. I would highly recommend to go to Root 174: it's a great atmosphere, delicious drinks, and food that you can't find anywhere else in the city. They also have a wide selection of vegan options."}
{"text":"Root 174 is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh (if not my favorite).  I've been here 3 times over the past few months (for a person that doesn't eat out at nice places too often, that's a lot).    The prices are very reasonable with entrees in the $20 range (BYOB is a huge plus too). The menu changes often -- everything always sounds so yummy & interesting that it's hard to decide (even the vegan options). Last night, I had the ricotta gnocchi with braised beef tongue, peas, parmesan, and an over-easy egg.  I wasn't sure about the combination of all the ingredients, but everything went together perfectly. The gnocchi literally melts in your mouth.  The little bites of beef tongue were delicious.  My boyfriend had the spring roll wrapped ahi tuna with kim chi and rice, which was also good (but not as good as mine!).   The other two times I went I had the smoked salmon sausage and chicken & waffles for my entrees, which were amazing.  I also highly recommend the pan seared scallops as an appeitzer and side of crispy brussel sprouts (with bacon jam).  I usually don't get desserts at restaurants, but the chocolate espresso cake was soooo good.  Service is great (the waitress with the funky glasses is the best).  Ambience is cozy and homey.   Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Came for lunch on a Saturday. Tried the pork belly and was delicious. Must visit for sure."}
{"text":"I recommend the brussels sprouts side dish - it is off the scale. Our wait person was very pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Fantastic Brussel sprouts! Really! Small, noisy, but great food! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After eating next door at the Thai Cottage, we ambled on over to Root 174 for cocktails. Little did we know that we should have parked ourselves here originally and forgone the Thai!!   The small, unassuming storefront opens up to an intimate dining room with a half bar at the back. Though there were many tables open (rather surprising for a Friday night at 8:30), we opted for the bar. We typically enjoy talking to the bartenders, and they always give great recommendations. Root 174 has a unique list of cocktails. I started off with the Royal Oligarchy, a slightly sweet blend of rye, St. Germain, and Cava. I loved the added bubble provided by the Cava. My boyfriend chose the Mezrita as his first (he is currently nursing an obsession with mezcal) and enjoyed the bitterness of his drink.  As we sipped our drinks and looked over a local pittsburgh events magazine, a heavily tattooed man showed up behind the bar and asked how we were enjoying our drinks. After we assured him that they were delicious, we realized he was the chef and owner! We then asked him for appetizer recommendations (who better to ask, right?). We needed some food with substance after our subpar dinner next door. He told us to try the coffee confit duck wings, and when they came out we were so happy to have taken his advice. They were crispy and literally falling off the bone. The coffee rub was slightly sweet and gave the duck a lovely flavor. The skin melted in your mouth. The wings normally come with a vanilla creme sauce, but since it included dairy we asked for it on the side. Our waiter was very helpful and gave great suggestions on other options for me with regards to my numerous allergies.  While we ate, the owner walked around the space and spoke with patrons, even sitting down with some to enjoy a drink. I appreciated his hands-on approach, and his eagerness to please his customers. He has an obvious obsession with Star Wars (you can purchase a Star Wars koozie,ha) and will unashamedly tell you all about it.   After one more delicious drink each, we headed out into the cool night, already planning our next visit to this unique and fun place."}
{"text":"It would have been hard to be more impressed with the meal I had here.  My wife and I came for dinner at about 6pm; luckily, we had a reservation, because the space is small and the dining area and bar were packed. As soon as we got a look at the menu, though, I realized why. There was not a single dish on the menu that did not intrigue me.  After much deliberation, I settled on my app and entree. I began with the \"bone marrow creme brulee\" -- holy crap, it was delicious. It wasn't soupy like other bone marrow I've had -- more like it had been churned, making it easier to spread. And of course, it was caramelized on top like any \"creme brulee\" ought to be. The caramelizing brought forth a sweetness that was unexpected, and a great counterpoint to the saltiness. It was a great spread which I enjoyed on buttery crisps of bread.  For my entree, I was a little less adventurous, opting for the eye of ribeye, served at a perfect medium rare, with creamy potatoes and Brussels sprouts. It was a lot to eat, but I bravely soldiered on and downed every last bite, just so I could tell you about it. Okay, I'm lying. I ate every last bite because it was freaking fabulously prepared, and I couldn't even stand the thought of allowing it to get cold.  For dessert, I had a pumpkin roll that was unlike any I'd ever tasted. It was spongier, not heavy at all, with toasted pumpkin seeds and a nifty whipped cream cheese.   I was truly blown away by every aspect of the food, and our service was stellar. Our server just seemed to anticipate what my wife and I would need, and was always at hand without seeming to hover. I can't wait to come back here and have another meal -- perhaps I'll dive in the deep end and try the headcheese next time?"}
{"text":"Diamond in the ruff!!! This place is amazing! The flavors they use pop in your mouth. Just do it!"}
{"text":"This place is no joke it was utterly delicious! We got to taste lots of different food through a connection in the kitchen and each course was more amazing than the next. We started with bone marrow creme brule....crazy I know, but oooh so creamy and delicious balanced with an apple slaw. Even something as simple as tomato soup and wedge salad were perfect and delicious. Don't skip the brussells  with bacon jam either! They are crispy and delicious.   Do not miss the duck sausage with pig heart ragu, easily the best pasta like dish I have EVER had. This rich dish was balanced by a fennel salad, the most perfect combination of rich and bright.   We finished with flourless chocolate cake and beat ice cream along with nuttella bread pudding. Im not big on sweets but both were delicious.   The only downer is they don't have a full bar but they do have an interesting cocktail list with some nice wines. If you're looking for a specific cocktail though you might need to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I loved the food here. I wasn't expecting much when I first got there but by the time I left I was blown away by what my pallet was telling me.   We started with the Brussel sprouts and bacon is a port reduction. What a great tasting dish. Fantastic. I could order 3 and make a meal. Then, we each had the fish of the day, ahi tuna. What a dish!! The black bean rice cakes along side the processed wasabi blew me away. Same as my friend. We both were overwhelmed by the flavors on such an unassuming dish.   KUDOS TO THE CHEF!  We finished  with the bartenders own custom after dinner cocktail, which was top notch. Couldn't have been happier. Will be back, for sure. Not your run of the mill Pgh restaurant. More like something you would find in LA."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place at the moment. The food is always cool tasty, a little rustic maybe. I fiend for the gnocchi! Carbonara is always on the menu I'm pretty sure, and it is amazingly tasty. It's a awesome experience. And it has a bar  and it's surrounded by some good bars for an after dinner drink. Always has a  great vegan option, for every course I'm pretty sure. GO HERE. The soup is always bomb"}
{"text":"Every item was outstanding.  We started with pickled eggs, a wonderful mushroom salad (with runny egg), and bone marrow savory creme brûlée - all wonderful.  Our second course was hanger steak (perfectly prepared) and the sweet potato pasta, which was divine.  No room for dessert, as the dinner portions were generous.  I have a new favorite restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"Terrific place.  Good food, good vibe, casual yet classy.  We arrived for our reserved time and had to wait a few minutes (got started on our BYO wine at the bar) for a few lingering patrons to take off - not a big deal and the manager was apologetic.  We decided to do a mix of appetizers and share an entree, all of which were very good.  Apps were an outstanding scallop/beef tongue hash, the bone marrow creme brulee (very rich and luscious, though maybe a bit sweet for our palates, but interesting nonetheless), and a mussels special with chipotle-tomato broth, yams and arugula.  The \"trout taco\", which we shared for our main, was phenomenal.  Large enough to share, it's a fillet of trout, breaded with masa flour and opened up to serve as the \"shell\" of a taco, which was filled with a crab salad and served over a black bean puree.  Major points for creativity, with execution and flavors to match.    Only minor downsides were the wait, lighting that felt like it could be a notch or two darker, and dessert - chocolate espresso cake that was a bit dry, and which was outshined by its accompaniments - a berry coulis and a decadent rum butter cream.  All very minor complaints, but have no doubt - this should be the go-to place for a classy (yet affordable) dinner in Regent Square."}
{"text":"Root 174 exemplifies the old adage, \"The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.\"  The facade is unassuming: red brick, two windows, with a small door in between.  If you didn't know what you were looking for (and if your attention isn't caught by the tree branch square root sign) you may well never know this place existed.  And your life would be all the poorer for your ignorance.  The décor inside is warm, but not extravagant.  Wooden benches, soft lighting, walls the color of a lighter shade of wood but most definitely not wooden, etc.  Artsy pictures of leaves and the like adorn the walls.  The overall atmosphere is comfortable and unremarkable, but some how grander than all of its individual components.  My party consisted of three people including myself, so we ordered three appetizers and three entrees.    The appetizers (Brussels sprouts, duck testicles, bone marrow crème brulee):  Ah the ever-popular crispy brussels sprouts with the bacon and black pepper glaze.  The brussels sprouts weren't very crispy, but the glaze was fantastic.  Sweet, savory, and rich, though not very bacony.  The brussels sprouts were also cooked perfectly inside.  A solid and very tasty appetizer, though honestly nothing too too special.  Next were the duck testicles.  I thought the sauce on the testicles themselves was a bit too peppery (not too spicy, too peppery), but it was complimented very nicely by the dill buttermilk and mint sauce.  Seriously, that dill buttermilk is a stroke of genius.  The testicles have a very interesting, almost gamey flavor to them, and are mushy in terms of texture.  The carrot and celery salad that accompanied it was literally just slices of carrot and celery.  Not particularly interesting, flavorful, or inspired.  Having said that, they did provide a nice crunch, and a bit of brightness to every bite.  Worth trying if you have the balls.  Finally, came the bone marrow crème brulee.  The predominant flavors were egg and parmesan with the bone marrow being virtually undetectable.  The brulee itself was honestly a bit bland, but paired very nicely with the tart green apple gremolta.    The entrees (pork belly banh mi, wagyu steak [special of the day], pork heart sausage):  The banh mi was a deconstructed sprawl separated into three equivalent portions.  Each portion had a slab of pork belly, crostini, a generous helping of duck liver mousse, pureed kimchi, mint sauce, pickled carrots, and radishes.  My pork belly was a bit overcooked though one of my fellow diners (whose taste I trust) insisted his was cooked pretty well.  The pureed kimchi was interesting though unrecognizable as kimchi.  The duck liver was exquisite: rich, fatty, and very very flavorful.  The pickled carrots also provided a wonderful contrast to all the rich flavors.  My only complaint were the radishes which I felt added little to the plate.  The wagyu beef our server recommended ordering medium-rare.  It was served with black rice, stir-fried kimchi, a five-minute egg, and pickled cabbages.  The rice and veggies were immaculate.  The kimchi paired very well with the smokiness of the steak, and the pickled cabbages just set off the rest of the dish perfectly.  Unfortunately, the steak itself, while well-seasoned and quite flavorful, was a bit tough.  The slivers of peanut mixed in with the rice though, were also delicious and complemented the flavors present quite well.  Finally came the pork heart sausage with polenta, what seemed to be fried kale, cherry tomatoes, and feta.  The sausage itself was a bit salty for our taste, but the flavor and aroma of the bits of heart were lovely.  The polenta was rich, savory, creamy, and amazing.  The fried kale as well, particularly taken in the context of the dish as a whole, worked very well to add some crunch and herbaceousness.  The cherry tomatoes provided a bit of tartness which undercut and balanced out the richness of the dish.  The feta provided another textural contrast but for the most part was drowned out by the other flavors except when I got a particularly big piece where it pushed the saltiness of that bite too far.    Notice a pattern?  In every dish there was at least one component that would have benefited from better execution, but its individual flaws were mitigated by the other parts of the dish and each one holistically was more or less successful.  Overall, I'd say this is definitely a restaurant worth visiting, and even revisting.  3.75/5"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner, in a fantastic place, full restaurant that felt a bit noisy, but overall a great experience"}
{"text":"It was my first visit here today and I thoroughly enjoyed it. However to future goers: don't expect an extensive menu or a large space. Root 174's menu is pretty small and the restaurant itself is also small.   Parking: Street parking.   Service: Great! Our waitress was very attentive, but it might have been due to the fact that we were the only customers there.   Food: I don't usually eat pork because I don't enjoy the flavor. I also don't really like gnocchi because I find the pillowy texture to not be enjoyable (I like chewy, al dente pasta textures) BUT I did get their Pork Belly Carbonara which has pork and gnocchi in it. WOW, I was not disappointed. I loved this dish. The gnocchi was different - the texture was chewier (maybe cause of the ricotta), which I loved. The egg was perfectly cooked. The pork belly was wonderfully seasoned. I thought the flavor combo of this dish was great and all the textures worked.   Dessert: I had the Lemon Lavendar Cake, which had a spongey cheesecake (similar to Japanese cheesecake, but not quite as good), some lavender powder, and lemon curd. The dessert was good - great lemon flavor, great cake texture - but I couldn't taste the lavender in the powder nor in the rest of the dessert. It would've been more appropriate to just call it Lemon Cake.   Overall: I would go back to this place to try a different item on their menu if they changed the menu items (the other items on the menu didn't appeal to me besides what I had today). I would definitely recommend this place. I don't give 5 stars out often, and I hope if I go back I can change my review and up it to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Given the average 4+ stars Root 174 has received on yelp, I was really excited about having dinner here for restaurant week. Overall I would have to say that the meal and experience was just okay. The restaurant week menu seemed to be an after thought. In fact, they just gave us the regular menu and told us our options from it. I had the cassoulet which I chose because of the oxtails, but didn't find the dish substantial and was hoping it would be similar to an oxtail stew with the bones. I found the crispy brussels to be way too sweet for my tastes."}
{"text":"I was super-psyched to try out this place, having heard lots of good things and looked at some mouth-watering pics of some really pretty plates of food on the website.  In the end, it's getting a mixed review from me though...  Let's start with the bar - 5 stars there.  I got there early and hung out for a while.  It's a little bar - just a few stools.  The bartender was great.  The cocktail menu really isn't my style, but it didn't matter because before I really even looked at it, the bartender told me that if I didn't see something I liked, he could make me whatever I wanted.  I did end up ordering from the menu, but the offer was much appreciated.     The table service was a whole different experience - this was a 1 star.   Our server was super-slow and had the personality of a napkin.  He couldn't have looked more bored and annoyed by his job and it was really off-putting.    The food is somewhere in the middle.  I ordered three things:  - Spanish devil on horse back - dates stuffed w/ chorizo, manchego cheese, port wine reduction:  These would have been fantastic IF they had been served hot (or even warm).  My plate was cold in the middle and room temp on the outside.  Not sure if that was intended or not, but I didn't dig it.   - Crispy brussels sprouts with bacon-black pepper glaze:  I love Brussels Sprouts and these were fine, but the glaze was really very sweet.  They were pretty and I ate them all, but probably wouldn't order them again.   - Pork belly carbonara - house made gnocchi, egg, cream, garlic, shallot:  This dish was absolutely beautiful, but I felt like it was missing something.  It's a rich dish and needed something to cut that just a bit.  Again, I ate it all, but probably wouldn't order it again.   Overall, I'd probably go back and probably enjoy it (as long as I didn't get that server again), but I can't say the experience made it a go-to place for me."}
{"text":"Since yelp has threatened to take my reviews down for direct links, and I want people to know how good Root 174 is, I'll just tell you to check my site for the complete review.  Food is great, Service is great, BYOB ($5 corkage)   another place that will be putting the Pittsburgh dining scene on the map."}
{"text":"We have had this place on our list of restaurants to try for over a year.  We finally got there and it was great!  It is a small place so definitely make a reservation.   The menu is short but everything looks good.  I had the falafal starter and it was fabulous.  Not your traditional falafal.  This was packed with flavors.  It had a spicy sauce and some pickled veggies as well.  Each bite hits a different area of your mouth.  My finance had the tomato soup to start.  It had bits of blue cheese and was one of the best soups I have had in a long time!   Everyone ordered something different for dinner and ate every bit of food off their plates!  Needless to say, nothing was just OK.  My vegan dish was amazing! (I am not a vegan, just wanted to try something different)  Again, very flavorful!   It is a bit more expensive then our average Friday's out, but I think worth it!  The wine list was fine, but I recommend getting a bottle.  Better deal!"}
{"text":"Visited Root 174 this weekend with a friend from SF. Although I'm the one who lives nearby, he had recommended it based off what he had looked into and Im glad he did! We started of sharing the shrimp terrine as an appetizer and then each had main dishes of wagyu steak and braised lamb neck with glasses of wine.  Everything about Root 174 was fantastic. Each dish had larger portion size than we expected and had excellent combinations of flavors, the wait staff was very attentive and helpful, and the small room setting had a great atmosphere. I highly recommend this place to everyone and hope to return someday soon.  It is a Pittsburgh restaurant that is definitely doing things right."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a friend and I was super impressed!  We had amazing cocktails, which were modestly priced for a craft cocktail at $9.  My friend had the soup and I had the beet salad to start - both delicious!  We both got the vegan meatloaf for our main entree and both practically licked our plates clean.  I loved all of the vegetarian friendly options on the menu. We also got dessert, the thai ice cream and the bread pudding.  Both were very unique and really good. I will certainly be going back here again very soon!"}
{"text":"Came here to meet some friends on a Wednesday night.  The place is super tiny but the décor is pretty cool.  You definitely need to make reservations- I could tell as I walked in and they immediately asked for the name on my reservation before a welcome.  We ordered a bunch of dishes and a few cocktails.  All the cocktails were tasty, but a little expensive.  For an appetizer we had the chorizo stuffed dates, I was actually very surprised on how tasty this was.  I am typically not a huge fan of dates but these were really yummy.  We also had the pork belly with gnocchi that was super tasty!  So good, that was one of my favorite dishes.  We had the coffee encrusted chicken legs which I thought were just okay, the banana chips were an interesting addition and I was surprised how well they went together.  My only complain is that the rub made the chicken a little dry.  I also had the pork belly with pop rocks and strawberry rice crispy treats.  This dish was interesting but maybe a little over the top.  There were a TON of flavors on the plate.  I like this restaurant because they have dishes on the menu that are fun and innovative.  It seemed a little bit on the expensive side for the area, but I would return as it seems like they serve very high quality food with fun ingredients.  I also like that their menu changes so often- lots of fun dishes to try!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I am a vegetarian, but this place always has multiple options for me. They even do a vegan prix fixe menu (normally unheard of!). This is the place where my boyfriend and I go for special occasions. The food is delicious and so creative. And the service is excellent too! If you want to go eat delicious food and be treated like a princess, this place is for you."}
{"text":"We decided to try Root174 on a random Wednesday evening and were surprised to find the place empty. It wasn't because the food or service was bad but just proximity to a holiday. This slow day made for an excellent experience for us. We had the undivided attention of our waitress, Michelle. She recommended amazing dishes for each course and never steered us wrong. The Brussel sprout and bread and salt appetizers were unique and delicious. Our entrees were equally as good. The hanger steak was the highlight of the meal with the Creme brûlée bone marrow. We finished our meal with the flourless chocolate cake. We would highly recommend this restaurant and can see why it's on Pittsburgh's best list!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner  and before our drink order was taken the waiter was reviewing the specials with us.  I hate to walk in and feel like you are being rushed  through the whole meal.  Even when we got to the end of the meal and ordered coffee we were never offered a refill, all in an effort to move us along.  No one was waiting for our table so I am not sure what the big rush was    The food was good but the service hurt our experience."}
{"text":"I am excited, impressed even, by how many vegan/vegetarian options Root 174 features on its relatively small menu.  Unfortunately, I was not so dazzled by the flavors of my choices.   I ordered a grilled curried cauliflower starter, which was very bland for my tastes. From the menu description, I thought it'd maybe have a little spice to it and I conjured up the idea that it'd have a sort of peanut curry sauce, however it was served dry. In addition, I was unaware that it was served cold until it came out and I am just not a big fan of cold foods. The cauliflower was also quite soft, overcooked I'd say, so it seemed like it was boiled, then grilled, then refrigerated. I was surprised by the generous portion size of this appetizer, especially as compared to that of my friend's watermelon.   For my entree, I chose the vegan vegetable cakes, which again, didn't pack much of a punch. I used to buy similar, yet immensely better and much cheaper, grain and veggie cakes at a grocery store in my last hometown. The corn salsa on the dish was fresh and thus pretty good. And the mole at the base of the dish was the best mole I've ever had. I may be a spiceaholic, as I do think the mole could have been improved with a little heat, but I cannot argue with the rich savory quality they've achieved with it. Ideally for me, this entree would be topped with (optional, understandably) fresh chopped chili peppers.   My friend got an elderberry-barbeque seitan dish with banana rice which as a whole had a more complex mouthfeel than my dish. All too lacking in vegetables for me, but I commend the skilled pairing of flavors.  They had a vegan dessert!!! It was ugly, it was disgusting!!! Zucchini something-or-other cake with a carrot frosting and some sort of compote...there was no distinction between its elements, all I could taste was sugar. The sweetness of it about knocked me out of my chair, seriously. If it hadn't been my mid-western dining companion's birthday (yes, they did put a candle in it), I would have complained. But since honest confrontation embarrasses her, we each took a couple of nibbles, said we were too full to finish it and she took it home to, uh, depreciate in private.  Dining out as a vegan in Pittsburgh is hairy. Despite my nitpicking, I do look forward to returning to see how Root 174 grows. I liked the unassuming space and our server seemed very knowledgeable. I brought champagne and they actually have flutes! The bathroom smelled fine and my birthday-girl friend was thrilled with the purple walls; I am glad that her visits to the toilet were special."}
{"text":"Definitely in the running for the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. There's a plethora of New American options in the city, and Root certainly measures up, and can even be fairly affordable, too (depending on what you order, of course). The menu seems to be updated fairly often, and there manages to be a surprising amount of variety among the small number of dishes from which to choose.  On first visit with my parents, we decided to just go tapas-style and share six different appetizers: scallops with grilled peach, pork belly with rice krispies treat, grilled watermelon and feta, confit coffee-rubbed wings, curry mussels, and brussels sprouts in black pepper bacon jam. Everything was great, but the standout for me was the brussels sprouts. They were tender, slightly crispy, and the jam is addictive--sweet, salty, spicy all at once. Our other favorite was the confit wings. I normally don't like dry rubs and initially was turned off by the tiny size of the wings...but they totally fooled me! The wings were SO juicy (I guess that's the confit talking). My dad actually said that they were the best wings he had ever tasted. I don't know about that, since I like my wings to be huge and slathered in buffalo sauce, but they were definitely a win.  On my second visit, me and my friend shared the bone marrow creme brulee, which I wasn't big on, but the gnocchi more than made up for it. I am always wary about ordering pasta, but this gnocchi passed the test for sure. Light, pillowy perfection. I haven't had gnocchi this good in...possibly ever? I know that's quite the statement but I can't help it, I was in gnocchi heaven. And it had an egg on it...the ULTIMATE topping! In stark contrast to the appetizers, the mains were pretty huge portions. Gnocchi for breakfast the day after? I think yes.  I did the brunch a few times when it was BYOB, bringing a bottle of Absolut Peppar for their excellent bloody mix (I haven't been back since the liquor license acquistion, but I kind of wish they'd bring back the BYOB--get drunk for ridic cheap). The corned pork tongue hash, get it. That's all I'll say about that.  One of my favorite places, and more intimate/less busy than the super-hyped Salt or Meat & Potatoes. Surprised there's not more reviews, but I guess it's a bit of a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We went there without a reservation on a Saturday night and was able to get 2 seats at the bar promptly. We got crispy Brussels sprouts for appetizer (5/5) and Pork belly carbonara (4/5) and Chorizo stuffed chicken leg (5/5) for entrees. The food was awesome. Some people wore business attires but the guy next to me at the bar had a tie-dye shirt, so the atmosphere was quite casual. The bartender was friendly and helpful as well. The bill was a little bit above $80 and I think it's reasonable."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow this place was AMAZING! My fiancé took me here on a Saturday night at 6:30 and there were just a few others there at the time so that gave us a quiet, romantic setting. It's a small, quaint restaurant so I wouldn't expect it to be quiet all the time, but I will definitely go back to find out. We started with Devils on horseback (one of the most unique foods I've ever tried and so delish!) and Brussels sprouts (if you like Brussels sprouts, you will love these!). We both ordered steak for dinner and the plate was so fabulous, unlike any meal I've ever had and i mean that in an extraordinary way! The way they prepared everything from the potatoes, to the asparagus, to the accents/seasonings and the perfectly cooked steak was my idea of the best meal ever. If you like typical American-(over)sized portions, then you may be a little disappointed with these normal-sized (yet fulfilling) portions, but if you're looking for a romantic evening, an exquisite meal, and good service, this place is a must go. I feel very highly about Root 174 and will recommend to all of my friends. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Where to start.....  My fiance and I went to Root 174 for my birthday on Friday.  I came to the decision to choose Root after much research, reading reviews, hearing things from other foodie friends, reading more about Keith Fuller, etc.  So I felt like I was making a very informed decision.  I was very excited to celebrate my birthday and try a new place with such great food.  I will start with the positives from the meal.  The brussel sprout appetizer was amazing!  Now I am not sure that they were overly complex, but I do love simple food done well, with simple sauces.  This was that type of dish.  The sauce was sweet but gave a great balance with the smokey, charred taste of the sprouts.  The wine we had  was also tasty.....a petite sirah I believe.  And the bread pudding with nutella mousse also hit the spot.  It was, again, very simple but done well.  Not overpoweringly sweet.     Now the negative.  I hate to say negative, because I am not a chef.  Maybe my palate is not fully developed or maybe my meal just wasn't the best thing I could have had on this particular night.  I had the tuna sausage.  It sounded interesting and right up my alley.  It came and it was presented beautifully on the plate.  It had fried cockscomb and roasted potatoes with it as well.  The sausage had a very strong, potent taste.  It was heavy in flavor and texture.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly but the cockscomb was greasy and flavorless.  I have had cockscomb before, so I do have something to compare it to.  My fiance had the heart sausage.  He NEVER complains about food, but he literally felt ill after eating it.  The sausage itself was good, but the slaw or whatever that was on top had an overpowering flavor that tasted like when you breathe in Pine-Sol when you are cleaning, that took over the entire plate.  I took a few bites and just couldn't get past it.  The beets that were on the plate were perfect and he definitely wished there were more simple veg with the sausage.  His starter was the duck testicles.  Neither of us have any experience with a dish like this, so it isn't even fair to rate it.  Overall, it was a disappointing meal, especially for my birthday.  I was truly so excited to go to Root 174, and unfortunately was quite disappointing.  We spent so much on this meal and neither of us were happy afterward."}
{"text":"Always quality. From service to food to beverage...it's a restaurant that will always be on my \"must dine\" list.   Dinner is always consistent,  service on point, drink menu is exclusive to the restaurant and wine list is unique.   Shared apps: devils on horseback,  chickpeas, beets, brussels.  Dinner: Lamb, Wagu, Pork Belly Carbonara"}
{"text":"The portion size was solid and you could taste each distinct flavor in the dishes. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars but this restaurant is really good!"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try Root 174 for a while, and it did not disappoint. This little space in Regent Square truly offered one of the best meals I've had in quite some time. Our table started with small plates and sampled a few. I tried the vegan falafel, which was lovely and spicy. The crispy brussels sprouts were delicious. But the winner was the coffee confit chicken wings. Yum. For my main course, I ordered the roasted chicken breast with chick peas and Moroccan spices.  Everything was perfectly prepared and the melding of flavors worked flawlessly. My only complaint was I was too full for dessert.  I'll have to return to find out what divine sweets Root 174 has to offer!"}
{"text":"I do not give 5 stars lightly, but I don't know if I'll find much better anywhere else.   It was a chilly, rainy night. Darren and I were both very hungry. I chose Root 174 based on some previous reviews and a glance at the ever changing on-line menu. After finding a place to park on the street a couple of blocks away we made our trek.   The place was mostly crowded and chatty, but we got seated right away and the ambiance of the crowd was pleasant. Nothing lake \"bar talk\". We started off with a bone marrow creme brulee. In a word, WOW. In a few more words, the combination of cheese and the meat from inside a bone was to die for. It was spread on toast and could be topped with green apple slivers. The marrow was simply the topping to this spread, but it was still worth every cent of the $5.00.   Then as my entree, I ordered what I will call the \"pork dish\" as it appeared to not have a formal name. My large plate consisted of mustard greens, white beans, and pork fried pork. That's right, PORK fried PORK. The hog shank that topped the tangy greens was to die for! It was very crispy (think bacon) on the outside and simply juicy on the inside. There was also a piece or cornbread with the meal to make sure that you knew that this is a Southern delicacy. All it was missing from the South was grits.   The desert was something innovative: peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Get this, cheesecake consisting of peanut butter chunks, topped with Root 174's own grape jelly (melted to a syrup), stuffed between two pieces of grilled pound cake. I should have ordered my own, but Darren and I split it. He also loved the cake.   The place is a pit pricey, put what a treat! Also, a lot of the food is vegan. So much so I almost felt guilty eating as much meat as I did."}
{"text":"Going here again tonight after a insanely unique and delicious dinner a fee weeks ago. Every aspect of the food is unique and carefully thought out. The manager/waiter (forgot his name) is incredible fantastic and personable. They know their food and creations. Definitely one of the best restaurants I have ever been to (semi-pro foodie).Lets see how things go on a Busy Friday night!"}
{"text":"a culinary tour de force  This is now our new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. My husband and I ordered the 5 course prix fixe option, and had the most fabulous meal.  He did not serve us the same items for each course, so we got to taste a broader spectrum of the menu. We both started with a fabulous chilled cucumber soup served over a scoop of frozen dill yogurt and picked beets, refreshing a just a little tart. This was followed by the apple fennel endive salad and the black caviar white anchovy cesar salad. The porkbelly appetizer with barbecue pop rocks and fruit compote had our mouths singing and popping, and the chorizo stuffed dates were also tasty. He threw in an order of the caramelized brussel sprouts with bacon jam sauce, and we both greatly enjoyed the tender roast chicken breast on a wonderfully spicy moroccan chickpea background. A deconstructed lemon cheesecake and a peanut butter torte with celery sorbet (surprisingly tasty) finished up our meal. It was just the right amount of food and we were full and satisfied, but not stuffed. The entire set of 10 dishes was creative, tantalizing and each very different from the other.  If I had to choose, I would pick soup, appetizer and entree over salad or dessert (although I want to try the beet ice cream and flourless chocolate cake when it is available).  They have a few nice outdoor tables and do not allow smoking indoors or out, so there is nothing to disturb from the enjoyment of the food."}
{"text":"The place is not bad: decent food, decent seating, decent everything. The problem is that looking back I don't have a single thing to rave about when it comes to that dinner. What was the highlight? Was it the falafel entree? The endive salad? The pork belly or the vegetarian meatloaf? I heard they're committed to a farm-to-table kind of approach, which I appreciate. I would really like to give them 5 stars but food-wise I wish they would let the ingredients shine a bit better."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about dinner, but brunch could eat a bowl of ....dice?  Extremely expensive breakfast with no frills and lack of character. Server didn't offer us alcohol, and as we were seated outside, had no idea they had drinks.  I sometimes try the \"standard\" fare at a brunch place to gauge the chef:  Sourdough bread...ok...it's bread Eggs...ok..they are eggs. Not even fatty or salty. BOO Homefries...look dawg, if you're a chef and can't make good potatoes you should think long and hard about what the hell you're doing. Seitan...look dawgx2, if I can make better seitan on the first try, you've got no business serving this. Forgettable."}
{"text":"Have you ever been halfway through eating a bahn mi sandwich, and then looked the waiter dead in the eye when he came to ask if you needed anything, and you respond with a deadly serious , \"Another of these sandwiches.\"?  Most people, most reasonable people, would say \"No.  That smacks of Caligula level excess, and anybody who would do that is quite mad.\"  And I would have agreed with you, until one fateful Saturday...  We had been here before for dinner, and it was pretty good, but I didn't really fall in love with it.  We were there towards the end of a busy night, and our server seemed to have been a bit burned out by the time we showed up.  The food was great, but we had a few hiccups with our order.  Oh, and we sat at a table next to the bar, and this older dude trying to dress like a club kid with those terrible jeans with crosses embroidered on the butt cheeks and his weird match.com ladyfriend kept smacking their barstools against our table.  (I should now mention that the place is relatively small.  The bar seating seems like a bad idea during a busy dinner service)  And looking back on this, I laugh at the young foolish man I was, not knowing that I would one day return and feast on two of the best bahn mi's I have ever had in my life.  We went on a Saturday afternoon, and there wasn't much of a crowd, which allowed some friendly patter with our waiter, and some in depth descriptions of what they had for lunch.  And what they had was two of the best bahn mi sandwiches I have ever had.  Slow roasted over the fires of mount doom, for 7 months, and flown to the restaurant by a soaring eagle, whose name translates to 'Windlord' , these sandwiches are just amazing. (or the waiter said slow roasted for 7 hours, and didn't make any reference to The Lord of the Ring.  My ability to focus has always been off kilter)  AND they have other stuff, that I'll try a bite of if somebody else orders it, but as long as that sandwich is available, I will always order it.  They also have a full bar, with excellent Bloody Mary's, and other craft cocktails that are amazing.  But what's even better, is that they have a Cult Movie night on Tuesday evening, with food and drink specials.  I have yet to be to one, but I will definitely check it out as soon as this summer stops being such a non-stop thrill ride of awesome."}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my girlfriend and her parents for dinner.  The whole place is quite small and we saw a sign we we entered saying that it seated 36.  With that amount of seating the inside was intimate but we all enjoyed the atmosphere.  There are tables everywhere, even some window seats and a small bar tucked into a corner which to the delight of my girlfriend had a really out of place Fraggle sitting on it.  It was also a little cold temperature wise in the restaurant but there was a big drop in temperature the day we went and so that might help to explain it.  We decided to start off out meals by splitting both the beet salad and the falafel.  The beet salad had large chunks of different colored beets and tasted quite nicely.  Meanwhile the falafel was a single huge cake served on top on a bed tri-color quinoa.  It had some good spices in it and worked well with the dill yogurt sauce that was spread on the plate.  For my entree I decided to go with lemongrass braised pork shoulder that came with a yam cake, jerked tofu and a frisée salad.  My girlfriend had the Chinese sausage stuffed calamari with squid ink pasta.  All of the dishes came out plated beautifully and looked wonderful.  I enjoyed both the calamari and the sausage stuffed inside of it from my girlfriends dish as it had a nice five spice flavor.  However her squid ink pasta was overrun by the soy sauce on the dish and all I could taste was saltiness.  On my dish I enjoyed everything with the only forgettable part being the frisée salad as it was nothing special.  The pork shoulder was a little fatty (that's the cut though) and went nice with the flavor of lemongrass sauce.  My yam cake paired nice with the yogurt sauce and the jerked tofu had a great spice palate to them.  We saw others ordering desserts and they all looked good but we were all full by that point.  The bottom line for me Is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  The atmosphere is nice and their menu outstanding both in variety and taste!"}
{"text":"My friend (another Yelp Elite!) and I love to try new restaurants. We had discussed trying Root 174 in the past but finally came here last week.  We made reservations for 6:30 on Tuesday evening, and I was the first to arrive. Now, when I say that I was the first to arrive, I mean that quite literally. There was no one else in this small restaurant other than a waitress and bartender when I entered. I had my choice of approximately 20 tables in the single room. Sometimes, being alone in a restaurant can feel a bit odd, but the waitress was very kind and helpful which made things feel less awkward. Plus, a few other people trickled into the restaurant around 6:45/7:00.  Let's get down to the important details... the food. Ahhh... it was so incredible. We started with the Brussels Sprouts, which were perfectly crispy and served with some sort of bacon glaze. Delicious! I really enjoyed Brussels sprouts at Butcher and the Rye a few months ago but thought that these were even better. I had been eyeing the Pork Belly Carbonara on the menu all day while at work, so I just had to try it when the waitress mentioned that it was one of Root 174's best dishes. The pork was pure rich and fatty decadence while the gnocchi were soft and fluffy little pillows of dough. The dish was served with a runny egg on top, which took this already incredible dish up even another notch for me. Heavenly!! Even though we were full, we just had to try a dessert and shared the deconstructed bread pudding served with a ridiculously good Nutella ice cream and white chocolate shavings.   I had a great time here and definitely plan on returning. My husband needs to try this place asap!"}
{"text":"Headed here with my hubby for restaurant week/birthday celebration with high hopes from all the great reviews.  I went with the restaurant week spread consisting of salmon tartare, chicken, and the red velvet cake.  Salmon tartare was tasty.  Chicken was AMAZING, it was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, with colorful and flavorful additions to the plate.  Red velvet was a poor choice, the cake was really heavy with a dollop of some fatty tasting cream that was just no good (could only eat a bit of the dessert, the rest ended up in a to go box which eventually ended up in the trash).  My husband got the mussels which we shared and they were very tasty with an excellent sauce and a cornbread.  He also got the short rib which was \"okay\"as he called it and notably was very dry.  We headed on home after dinner...  ...jump forward to midnight, uh oh I feel nauseous and my stomach starts to hurt.  I spend the next 2 hrs throwing up.  I'm not sure what exactly it was - salmon tartare?  mussels?  fatty cream on the dessert?  Something in that dinner made me pretty ill that night and for that, I don't know if I'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for the perfect moment to write my review of Root 174. Since I woke up this morning craving the fried brussel sprouts (read: salivating over them), I figured this was the perfect time. The head chef, Keith, personally invited us to the opening party, after we creepily stood in the doorway peering in the night before. I noticed that he was going around to every table, introducing himself and making sure everyone was taken care of. He believes in \"giving back\" to the community and offers a discount to those livin' in the 15221 (my hood, holla!). The guy is just super nice, period. Will, the manager, I also no slouch- he came over, chatted us up, and really made use feel welcome. Great guy.  Ok- now on with the food: Fried Brussel Sprouts. Oh lord in heaven, they are so good. Crispy, tangy and the perfect balance of salt an sweet, topped with a bacon chutney. The tostanoes, a flat plantain with refried black beans and corn exploded with flavor- so tasty, perfect sweetness. They have a seasonal menu, so these goodies may not still be on there but TRY them if they are. I cannot wait to return for the entrees! They are BYOB, which is always a plus.  Root 174 is the perfect spot to bring out of town friends who you want to experience the best that the 'burgh has to offer. I am so pleased that these friendly, innovative folks have graced my neighborhood. I am hoping that they do a brunch, but will contInue to love them regardless!!"}
{"text":"As with many such cases, I wish I could give this place a 3.5. It's clearly better than some of the 3s I've given, but not quite a 4.   Anyway, I ate here with my wife last night and it was a good experience. The decor is pretty much the same as it was when Legume was there, so nothing new here. The waitstaff were fine. Our main waiter was a bit too quiet and so hearing him describe the specials was quite a chore. This was the case even though when we got there, we were the only ones in the restaurant (no ambient noise at the time).  But what about the food...the part that really counts! My wife and I had 4 dishes, two which were okay, and two which were actually quite good.  1. The beet + goat cheese salad. Meh. Nothing special here at all. The flavor was bland and nothing we couldn't get at a dozen other places. 2. The grilled watermelon salad (with a balsamic reduction). Now this was really unique and flavorful! I would get it again in a heartbeat.  I loved the idea of grilling watermelon...it gave it this different texture (almost crispy on the outside) and dampened some of the sweetness. If I only tried this dish, I would give the restaurant a 4.5 star rating. Too bad the rest wasn't as tasty. 3. The gnocchi main dish. Just like with the beet salad, meh. It was pretty bland and uninspired. I could have made these at home and they wouldn't have been any worse. And for $20+ I was disappointed. 4. The brussel sprout + bacon marmalade side dish. Like the grilled watermelon salad, this was fantastic. The sweetness of the marmalade offset any bitterness from the brussel sprouts. I've never had anything like this dish and I hope they keep it on their regular rotation.  I'll definitely give this place another shot in the future, but for now, it won't make it to the usual rotation. Maybe one day when they work out the kinks. Now I just can't wait for Legume to re-open in their new location!"}
{"text":"We stopped late on a Tuesday night, around 9:00pm. They close at 9:30 but we were only planning to have salads so I didn't feel too bad about coming in so close to closing. I had a lovely glass of Pinot noir, I wish I had written it down so I could purchase a few bottles. Perfectly light for a summer night. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable. Chris ordered the black caviar Caesar salad and I had the seasonal apple and fennel salad. Our server was nice enough to accommodate a request for a side of pickled vegetables and I'm so glad because they were great! I could still taste the vegetables in addition to the pickling spices and they were still crispy! So good! Chris really enjoyed his ceaser. There was a generous portion of caviar and three plump anchovies. The only complaint he has was that there was a good bit of dressing, to the point where he was avoiding the additional dressing on the plate because the lettuce had already been tossed in dressing. Regardless he said it was very good. The apple fennel salad was fantastic. It came with macadamia nut soft cheese that was amazing! I would have loved some bread or crostini with that cheese on it! Wonderful. The apples and fennel went perfectly together with a hint of anise. And there was a small amount of beet mousse on the plate as well! Yum!! Beautiful plating, great service, and delicious food. We have to go back for a full dinner so they can earn that last star!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ended up eating brunch here by accident today.  All the other places we'd thought about trying on Braddock were either closed or had ridiculously long lines.  (I'm looking at you, Square Cafe!)  We saw this place was open and had seating available, so we made our way inside and prepared to be spontaneous.    Since I don't like eggs and they seem to ubiquitous these days, it's always hard for me to find something to eat on a brunch menu.  I had two choices here: french toast with strawberry balsamic jam or plaintain-chocolate chip pancakes.  After much deliberation, I went with the french toast, and unfortunately, I found it lacking.  The bread was really dry, and there was not enough strawberry jam to make it palatable.  I don't remember ever needing a knife to cut french toast before, but I did today!  The jam tasted really good, though.  My husband had a plate with two eggs, home fries, a piece of toast, and a sausage patty.  He thought the sausage was really great!  I got to taste a little bit, and it had a lot of cayenne pepper in it, as well as other herbs and spices.  I suspect this is something they make in-house.  The rest of his meal was just so-so, and although the portion size was perfectly fine, it looked skimpy on the huge dinner plate they served it on.  I don't think I'd come back here again for brunch, as it was nothing special, but if you're waiting in line forever at the Square Cafe, you should know that you have this other option."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for the first time on Valentine's Day. Root 174 most certainly did not disappoint.  The ambiance was lovely and the service was excellent. Because of the holiday it was filled with couples, however I feel that, while small, they wouldn't have an issue accommodating a larger party.  We started with the mussels appetizer, which were fantastic. It was also the perfect size for two people to share.  I had the gnocchi with beef tongue.  I have to say that I've never eaten beef tongue before, but I was feeling adventurous.  It was great! The meat was tender and flavored perfectly. My BF had the tuna special, which was yummy.  The tuna was great.  For dessert we split the chocolate cake with local berries. Yum!  I will most definitely be back to Root 174 and plan on telling friends to check it out."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Root 174 for a lonnnngggg time.  Probably since I moved to Pittsburgh 5 years ago.  I finally made it there for my birthday dinner this year, and it did not disappoint.    We shared the tomato bisque which was a perfect way to warm up from the chilly evening.  Savory yet slightly sweet, a great start.  Next the grilled octopus - I've never had it before.  I've had calamari and that's either fried or grilled with a light lemon juice, but this octopus was different.  It was a savory dish with ethinic spices... that's the only way to describe it.  I enjoyed it, but I probably wouldn't order it again.  For my main course, I ordered their special of sea bass.  Nicely cooked and flavorful - I enjoyed every bite.  Finally the birthday dessert of bread pudding with hazelnut whip.  It was decadent and savory and I didn't want to share!  Mmm so good...  I'm pleased to say that my hopes for Root 174 were sufficiently met.  I will be visiting Root 174 again... I'm not waiting another 5 years."}
{"text":"This is the third ultra fancy restaurant I've had the pleasure of visiting this year, and our experience on a random Wednesday evening truly was remarkable.   We made a reservation for 6:30 but when we walked in we were the only ones in the place. My friend had been buzzing about this place for years, as he lives right down the street, and finally convinced me to try it despite me being less than enthused about the menu prices.   Well, I can honestly say that everything I had here was fantastic. We tried the pork belly with pop rocks, the crispy brussel sprouts with sweet glaze, and the Spanish Devils on horseback for a start. The brussel sprout app was a reasonable size for the price, but with the other two I found myself wanting more for the price per dish. If you can't tell yet, I'm all about getting my money's worth. All of the starters were delish, even if the two aforementioned ones were small. The chef himself hand delivered them to our table. Not sure if that's normal or if it was because we were the only table in there and he was bored, but I thought it was a nice touch.   My main dish was SO good. All that sauce on the hangar steak plate and it all went together so well. I don't really like raw tomatoes, but I ate up every last one that graced my plate. Also had some delish croutons up on the plate and I loved it. Chef knows what he's doing.   I tried my friend's vegan meatballs and while the flavor was good, the quinoa has a mushy texture that I wasn't expecting. Not bad, but just...mushy. It was more like a stuffing ball.   I've never had bread pudding before here, and I'm forever changed. It was so rich, buttery, not on my diet plan and so amazingly good. Cannot shut up about it. So good! The beignets were tasty but the texture was a lot more crispy than expected and certainly  not nearly as great as the bread pudding.   Two things: our main server was slow with the service. It seems like they have the bartender/manager guy and only one other server working the front of the house. It was fine when it was just us, but towards the end of our meal the place started to fill up and she was nowhere to be found. It's also incredibly dark in there, and the all wood furnishings make it loud when other parties come in and talk like they're in a sports bar.   I cannot afford to frequent this place with any sort of regularity, but it's certainly marked on my list if I ever need a fancy place to celebrate a special occasion or I want to try something different."}
{"text":"Overall: Quality service, food, drink, ambiance, and experience.  The service: I decided to go here with my girlfriend for our anniversary. The moment we walked in, we knew we had picked the right spot. Our server was very pleasant and informative.  We enjoy wine but are not the most informed quite yet... the staff was very helpful and honest when we were picking a wine. One thing I was not aware of is that though they do serve wine, you can bring your own for a $20 corkage fee. This price seems a bit high to me (maybe not?) but it is nice to have the option.  The food: We chose the vegan falafel and Spanish devil on horseback (what a name!). The falafel was absolutely delicious and I highly recommend this dish. The Spanish devil in horseback (dates stuffed w/ chorizo, manchego cheese, port wine reduction) was decent but not excellent. The dates and port were a bit overpowering and made it almost more of a dessert. I would love to have this dish again but with more chorizo and cheese.  For entrees, we had the vegan meatloaf and boneless short rib. Both were absolutely delicious! I highly recommend both of these.  If we had room, we would have definitely had a dessert. An app and a main dish were perfectly satisfying and just the right portions.  Root 174 has a great thing going on and is going to get more of my business in the near future. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Interesting.  Fun.  Inventive.  Intimate.  There's lots of restaurants around the country reinventing dishes and deconstructing others.  This one is about average for the genre for me.  I would come back and try some other dishes because I'm not sure exactly how good this place is yet.    I started with a really good house cocktail.  They make a manhattan that tastes like it met a camp fire.  Smokey and a little sweet.  Very tasty.  I had the brussels sprouts and their version of a cassoulet.  I've had a lot of brussels sprouts these days.  Seems everywhere I do there's a rendition.  These are tasty.  Bacon, a little sweet, a vinaigrette, crunchy, a little rich.  I liked them.  The cassoulet was good, it had some highs and lows for sure.  I liked the chicken hearts and the fried chicken wings but the sausage and pork belly weren't my favorite components.  The sausage was over seasoned for the dish or maybe the wrong seasonings for the dish.  I'm not sure but it bothered me a little.  I am sure I would have liked them in something else.  The pork belly wasn't the unctuous braised melt in your mouth kind I really like.  Cassoulet is always very rich and this one was as well.  I liked the tomato base as it cut the richness and added a bright note.    I ordered the lemon lavender cake and some french press decaf for dessert.  The dessert is excellent.  It comes with a slightly salty pistachio tulle.  Nice!  Decaf is very good.  My wife had a decaf and a cocktail and the total was $125 with a tip. It's a really small restaurant but it wasn't full by any stretch at 7pm on a Friday night.  Still, I would call for a reservation.  We got lucky with parking on Braddock.  I'm not sure where you would park otherwise."}
{"text":"So torn between 3 and 4 stars--several items we had on the tasting menu were standout, but this was not the case for every item, so we're sticking at 3.  Service was prompt but fairly impersonal. We were celebrating, as we informed our server, but he didn't ask what. Our courses came out extremely quickly--we had 5 courses in just over an hour, and at one point, we had two and a half courses on the table simultaneously. To top it off, there was a large party with two loud young children seated next to us, and this is not a large restaurant. This was pretty distracting and disappointing considering the price and potential ambiance of the restaurant.  However, the tomato bisque was very good, and the chorizo and octopus bolognese was absolutely sensational--best octopus I've ever had. The fish course didn't really come together, and the caviar caesar, while creative, lacked balance in the elements (strange to say it but there was too much caviar!). But we appreciated that we were served different items for some of the courses, although in general, the items weren't things we would have picked. I feel bad about the 3 star rating as some items were 5-star and we'd definitely return to try another iteration of the tasting, but the cold service and high variance food keeps them down at three stars for now."}
{"text":"Culinary creativity is a rare entity to encounter in Pittsburgh.  However, thanks to photos uploaded by fellow Yelpers, chef Keith Fuller's gastronomic work caught my attention during one of my random nights perusing this site.  The next step was to verify my curiosity, by making a visit to Root 174 and indulge myself with the multi-course tasting menu.     Food (9.5/10) =  1) Watermelon soup with cantaloupe, peach, ricotta cheese, pistachios = A very refreshing way to initiate the multi-course dinner on a summer night.  The pistachios provided a balanced nutty component to the natural sweetness of the fruits, while the ricotta cheese added a non intrusive creamy/savory element. 2) Crispy brussel sprouts with bacon-black pepper jam = Big fan of brussel sprouts!  Root 174 excels with this dish.  The name of the dish says it all.  It's crispy.  There's the fattiness from the bacon.  There's the sweetness from the jam.  A true winner. 3) Black caviar caesar with parmesan, baby kale, egg, white anchovies, focaccia = I'm usually bored with caesar salads, however the execution of this caesar salad was impressive.  Note, I'm also a sucker for poached eggs! 4) Figs with blue cheese, beets, brown sugar crumble, and a gastrique (forgot what kind of gastrique) = One of the best fruits to indulge in during the summer months.  It doesn't get any better than pairing fresh ripe figs with cheese. 5) Apple fennel salad with  macadamia \"cheese,\" maple black pepper vin, grilled radicchio, walnuts =  Another outstanding refreshing summer time salad.  Certainly a great dish to have before moving on to the more savory dishes on the menu. 6) Pork belly with rhubarb, strawberry apple compote, savory rice crispy, jalapeno, barbequed pop rocks, banana = Love pork belly.  But to pair it with rice crispy treats and barbequed pop rock candy?  WTF?!  This was the most creative dish of the night, and was I immediately intrigued when I saw it on the menu.  All the components work well with each other.  This dish was absolutely fun and playful, and I wonder if this dish best exhibits chef Fuller's personality. 7) Grilled octopus with romesco, olives, pickled potato salad, pesto = I rarely...RARELY order octopus, since most of my prior experiences were overcooked, tough octopus meat.  Wow, was I pleasantly surprised when my fork sank into the meat with little effort.  I did not expect to find octopus this tender in the middle of Pittsburgh.  Bravo.  The brininess of the olives were well balanced with the octopus. 8) Coffee confit chicken wings with curried creme fraiche, dried banana chips = The only other time I've had coffee rubbed into meat was with steak.  I've now been educated that coffee can work well with chicken.   9) Chorizo stuffed chicken leg with mole sauce, creamy grits, pickled cauliflower, and peanuts = My favorite dish of the night.  The chicken meat was hella tender, and married well with the spiciness of the chorizo.  Also, some of the best grits I've had since I left the South.   10) Hanger steak with halloumi, apricot, cardamom, black rice puree, kale, cream corn, tomato, bread = The hanger steak was very tender and well executed.  The black rice puree looks just like chocolate.   11) Beignets with ganache and orange chips = The only dish of the night I was not impressed with.  Having lived in Louisiana for several years, my palate has been spoiled by beignets from down South. 12) Bread pudding with ice cream dessert = Soft.  Moist.  Warm.  Sweet.  Chocolate.  Ice cream.  Need I say more? 13) Celery sorbet = Second time in my life I've encountered celery sorbet (first time was in San Francisco 6-8 years ago at One Market Restaurant).  This dessert was a fantastic way to conclude the night, and was just as exciting and refreshing as the watermelon soup,   Service (9.5/10) = Our waiter was fantastic.  Not overbearing, and he knew the menu well to describe the components of these complex dishes as they were brought to our table.     Ambiance (8.5/10) = A very simple and small yet cozy environment.   Overall Opinion = Chef Keith Fuller's tasting menu is an absolute killer.  $67 for all the dishes I mentioned in this review?  What an awesome experience.  I'm surprised this restaurant doesn't share the same level of popularity as other restaurants in Pittsburgh (e.g. Meat and Potatoes, Butcher and the Rye, etc.).  Is it location?  Is it the simple ambiance?  Is it the level of creativity that Pittsburgh palates may not be accustomed to?  Who knows... What I do know is this restaurant is a true gem, and if you have been in Pittsburgh for a while and haven't visited Root 174, get your ass to this place ASAP.  Why didn't I give this place 5 Yelp stars?  Well, it was the beignets.  I only give 5 stars when everything has been perfect to me.   Ideally, I would've given this restaurant 4.5 stars.  Regardless, bravo to Chef Fuller!"}
{"text":"This place is truly unique and amazing! I've been here a few times and have always had a great experience. In particular, I remember the coffee confit wings being spectacular and the braised octopus dish that surprised me with how tender and juicy octopus can be. Not only is the food creative and delicious, the staff is great and the chef even came out and said hello to us! We love going here for a nicer date night, since it is pricey, but very worth it!"}
{"text":"Filed under fancy plate Pittsburgh. It might have taken me four years to get here, but I finally made it on a Wednesday evening looking for something casual but impressive for my NYC companion. While I wasn't crazy excited to tell everyone to get here ASAP, it was still great. For as much food boom as we're having here, it's hard to find items outside of brussel sprouts and pork belly (although they do have both here too!). The place itself is small and intimate, so luckily we were one of three or four tables.  We grabbed the window booth (which are screened so you don't have that weird passerby looking at your table thing going on--yaknow?) and listened to a hoard of frantic specials I can't remember. Overall, dinner mate thought it was \"brilliant,\" while I thought it was good enough for me.  Started with two lavender gin cocktails, which I expected to be flowery corpse reviver (lillet was included!), but received more of a mild purple gimlet.. That isn't necessarily a complaint, just different! My colleague had about five negronis (negrono?) so I can only assume they were delicious.  I tried brussel sprouts.. They were roasted in a vegan wine sauce and tasted like spring rolls. Tiny bowl. I ate 'em all. Luckily it was small because I then moved onto a huge vegan meatloaf.  I've also never had meatloaf (look at me, wild and crazy) as a non-beef eater but I'll assume this was close.  It was highly recommended to me so I was a little disappointed when it was just OK. Layered with asparagus and a light \"almond cheese\", I was a fan. A bit dry? I was kind of into it. Everyone who is a regular eater would probably think it's a bit odd.  Dinner mate had a super pretty plate of real cow that he was very impressed by. I'm a sucker for sauce dots and swirls and all that frou frou stuff (read: yinzer goes to dinner somewhere other than D's sixpax).  This is the most underrated spot of all the Pittsburgh restaurant boom. Root 147 deserves a majillion more accolades than the Penn Ave joints, but I think it's getting lost in East Regent Jabip or just that it's been around now for a whole four or five years. It's really worth it to cross Fort Frick Park for these fancy lil' plates."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service!  Very creative menu, I had the Braised Short Ribs, not a touch of fat, and the flavor was better than perfect.  My husband had the Seafood special, it was truly a work of art!  The Redwood Salad was spectacular, the parsnip soup, very flavorful, but, the best part of the meal was the \"Bombe\".  Even when we questioned our Waitress about possibly adding a third appetizer, she suggested holding at two apps to leave room for Dessert-She was right, I would go back just for the dessert and coffee!"}
{"text":"I went for Restaurant Week and can't say enough good things. So many people have discussed the in's and out's of this place so I'll keep it simple. It is small in there. I was expecting small but this place was cozy. I would certainly recommend a reservation. The brussel sprouts with bacon jam were phenomenal. If you dine with someone who says they don't like brussel sprouts order them anyway. They just may be surprised. My salmon was done perfectly and the kale, harissa, and onions added another great level of flavor. On to the desserts. My meal came with the flourless chocolate cake with beet ice cream. I don't even know what to say. Beet ice cream, without a doubt is one of the best things I've put in my mouth in a long long time. I didn't know what to expect and boy was I pleasantly surprised. Not too sweet but light and the perfect balance for the dense chocolate cake. My partner in dining ordered the nutella bread pudding. Maybe an obsession with nutella is something limited to females in their 20's. But, I doubt it. There IS a reason why nutella is loved the world over. Anything with nutella in it is wonderful in my book, and this dessert certainly didn't disappoint. I've been talking about the place non-stop and I can't wait for them to start brunch back up in the Spring!"}
{"text":"First dining experience at this restaurant did not disappoint.  The ambiance was lovely, our server very friendly and knowledgeable (with a good sense of humor, too), and the food simply amazing.  We had the bone marrow creme brulee, warm mushroom salad, falafel entree, and mussels special.  All were inventive dishes with interesting yet balanced flavors.  Since it's BYOB, it's fun to get a six pack from Dees across the street to pair with dinner here.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a review of Sunday brunch, which I understand they just started serving. They need to figure out how to do so or go back to being closed for brunch, because both the food and the service were sub-par.  Though the place was mostly empty, it took forever to get our meal, and when it arrived, it was disappointing at best.  I've had better French toast at, well, almost everywhere, including at home, where it arrives much quicker.  The candied pecans were sparse (maybe 5), and no big deal.  None of us was thrilled with our food.  And Brussels sprouts for breakfast?  I guess they're popular at other meals, but that just seemed weird."}
{"text":"This review is based on a 7 person experience last night.  Your mileage may vary.   The group was initially seated by the front door -- artic winds swept the group initially until everyone stood up and said... a new table please.  At 6 or so there were no other diners so this was managed without any problem.  Note: at about 7:30 pm the place became jammed.    This was the first experience of Root 174 (which, by the way, is a very geeky title to their restaurant as you will see when you visit).  I read the Yelp and Urbanspoon reviews and thus had an order list ready.  But the Bang Mi is, unfortunately, only a lunch item.  On this the management failed as Bang Mi is but a Vietnamese sub sandwich and can be prepared anytime.  I digress...  The staff, wait, bar and back area were busy and attentive.  You must understand that this is a sliver restaurant and if you are not careful with watching the address markers you will walk by it.  But it will be worth your time and pallet.  The Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Bacon-black Pepper Glaze was smokey and interesting.  Not everyone will like fried sprouts with glaze but 3 people at the table who ordered it did.  I also got the Vegan Felafel, warm quinoa, pickled fennel & onion salad which was excellent in both visual presentation and taste.  We did joke a bit about the Crispy Duck testicles, blue cheese, dill buttermilk, carrot celery salad but no one ordered it.  The Jamaica's ginger beer was a nice pallet refresher.  The French Press hot tea was also good.    In our experience, there was no lapse in service.  We all arrived and were the only folk there for 30 minutes then every chair, stool, table... filled up.  Service remained fine throughout.    Their WWW page menu appears to be down -- I called them about this yesterday so you may not be able to view the menu.  Just checked and it is back up. I had hoped the Bang Mi sandwich would be available in the dinner menu but they said no.  This is a lapse in service since it is but a Vietnamese sub sandwich is not a deal breaker but a rigidity one would not find at Echo in Cranberry.  Suggestions:  Remember that in the winter sitting by the front door will be troublesome.  This is a small place and when people come in, you will be flooded with cold air.    We will be back to try the Bang Mi as others have said it is excellent.  Opps: forgot to mention the Curry Ice Cream ... that was simply a new taste experience.  On this alone I moved from a 4 to a 5.    RR"}
{"text":"Note #1: Root 174 is easy to miss when driving down South Braddock Avenue in the sleeper, Squirrel Hill-ish neighborhood (nice area!) of Regent Square, particularly during a drizzly, drafty night. The stylized sign is difficult to see after dark. Look for The Green Mango; Root 174 is 2 doors down.   Note #2: Our bill (2 people) came to $58.32, putting us at the border between $$ and $$$. I ordered the cheapest entree, which was the falafel at $15. The special that Kay ordered (pork shank) was $22.  Note #3: We must've lucked out being that we came between 9-10 PM on a Friday night since we did get a seat without waiting.   Note #4: They apparently tweak their minimal menu often as some of the things we ordered aren't on there now or deviated since our visit. Bear with me as I will try to recall the details of our meal as best I can.   This South Hills boy and his Beaver County girl were somewhat out of their element here. It's hard to believe D's Sixpax and Dogs is on the same drag with all of the bespectacled, scarf-wearing, erudite folk we ate amongst at Root 174. The booths are of a European fashion, meaning if you're sitting on the bench against the wall like I did, you're literally sitting right next to someone, which in my case was a gushy blonde in leather pants who loved discussing her upward mobility in such economically turbulent, unequal days. This class warrior just focused on the lovely lady sitting right in front of him as he sipped on Boylan's excellent, refreshing Ginger Ale instead of wine.   The servers give you an anxious spiel, reiterating the menu as if they're members of a youth outreach ministry and then congratulate you on whatever you order. I wasn't sure what to make of it all, but when I dug in to appetizer, entree, and dessert, I did know that I was in the midst of culinary brilliance and virtuosity.   As I mentioned earlier, Bone Marrow Creme Brulee began our meal. The creme brulee came in a ramekin on a long rectangular plate with baguette slices to apply the creme brulee upon and a garnish of shredded, herb-sprinkled Granny Smith apples. I was so excited to try the bone marrow, that I was almost shivering as I slathered it onto the bread only to have my heart and soul taken by its milky texture, its subtle, smoky flavor. When we used up the chewy, porous bread, we scrambled to scoop the remaining goo from the ramekin. Then we realized we neglected the apples, which Kay let me dispatch. Whatever spirits possessed the apples only made a sassy fruit even sassier.   Deciding to climb out of my comfort zone and concurrently save some coin, I found that the falafel was a wise choice for me. The portion left me wanting somewhat, but what I did have made me wonder why it too so long for me to have falafel. The trio of crispy, mashed chickpea spheres revealed their delicate nature quickly as I cut into them in order for them to cool, but when I dragged each bite through Root's own harissa (a Tunisian hot sauce) smear, street vendor food suddenly became the most opulent dish I've ever consumed. I fought my animalistic urges and tried to eat slowly, savoring the curried rice, the strong, minced kalamata olives that composed the tapenade, the black cardamom yogurt that laced the rice...was it all too much?  Enter Kay's Dish: The Pork Shank. I had the pleasure and privilege of assisting Kay with this and will say with utmost sobriety that I've never before encountered a pork prepared more perfectly than this. Cooked in pork fat, this meat didn't just fall off the bone; it undressed itself for you. Friable on the outside, moist and succulent inside, all that was necessary was a sesame bun and some BBQ sauce, but no...there would be mustard greens involved in this glorious fracas, tangy, rich mustard greens. White beans, something I can normally take or leave, took on the deeply Southern flavors of the exquisite pork-and- mustard green marriage like a suburban youth discovering Delta blues after getting stranded in Memphis.   An unlisted dark horse charmer of a dessert was mentioned by our server, and instantly I no longer wanted Chocolate Espresso Cake. No, on this night it would be PB&J Cheesecake. A treat so simple, so obvious, one wonders why it hadn't been done before, it was made with HOUSE Concord grape jelly, and for an added touch of whimsy, our shared cut was bookended by two grilled pieces of angel food cake acting as toasted white bread. The child inside me bounced off of the walls with each morsel.   Root 174 is a restaurant for the critics, stuffing amazing cuisine into the mouths of the snobs, the detractors, and the malcontents, smirking as their muffled complaints turn into happily stunned silence. We have a scene to be reckoned with here, people."}
{"text":"A meal where the chef is inventive and has the knack of combining fresh ingredients into a wonderful satisfying dining experience.  Had reservations and when a good friend found out, they called and changed the reservation from 2 to 4 so we could enjoy great food together.  Root has been on our to eat out list but for many reasons, never had the opportunity to experience it.  Well, we were not disappointed!   We started with the Crispy Brussels sprouts, bacon-pepper jam.  Nom.  Perfect beginning.  The roasted red and gold beets, black pepper chevre, orange, fennel, radish was a great combination of flavors.     For the main course, the Beer-Braised pork and sauerkraut, Yukon golds, pork jus, whole grain mustard was scrumptious.  Was able to get a taste of the Grilled hanger steak, bean tamales, cabbage slaw, and it was really tasty and very good...but the Braised pork was out of this world!  While we were pretty full, we did try a desert. Try the chocolate mouse comes on a cookie....oh so prefect!  Make sure you have reservations, at least on weekends.  We had one of the tables in the window and it seemed like we were almost by ourselves.    It is BYOB.  So bring something special to drink with a special meal!"}
{"text":"Majority of the food was excellent. Every last bite of the apps and entrees were devoured. The dessert was a split decision among those at the table. It was not something I enjoyed. The place is incredibly small, so I would recommend making reservations, and asking not to be at the table in the path of the kitchen.  The service could have been quicker, luckily our server was not in charge of refiling our drinks. The woman with the water pitcher was prompt!"}
{"text":"Amazing exciting foodie restaurant. I am so stoked it's walking distance. Like a freaking  dream come true. Last time did the tasting menu, this time 3 friends and I came tonight ordered a few dishes and shared.  Everything was so amazing. I don't think anything on their menu could be anything less than tasty interesting"}
{"text":"I went for a Dogfish Head dinner and was totally wowed by the food! It was a 6 course meal sampling 6 different beers from Dogfish Head Brewery. Both the food and beers were incredible; both great on their own, but exceptional when paired. Kudos to the chef, Keith Fuller on his incredible palate and mad chef skills."}
{"text":"I decided to take myself out for a splurge kind of meal here. I had the oysters with fingerling potatoes and cornbread - the oysters and the potatoes themselves were definitely good and in a nice hearty stout broth - if not super-memorable.  However, the cornbread itself was out-of-this-world melty-crumbly-creamy-perfect-deliciousness and completely made the meal.   I may have given it a higher rating, but the ambiance (it's close-quarters, not-too-comfy seating with other diners) didn't delight me for the price point (those oysters were on the appetizer menu and ran $18).  There's not another high-end dinner option that I can think of in Regent Square though - and that cornbread just may have been worth the $18 in itself."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful dining experience. The crispy Brussels sprouts for an app was delicious. The swordfish special was Mediterranean style was well seasoned,perfectly cooked. The short rib was very tasty , but more fatty than I would have liked, but a great dish. The pork belly carbonara was cooked perfectly. And lastly the roasted chicken was great, one of the sauces on the plate was very spicy, but worth the try. The service was very attentive , a great experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a pretty crowded night that was kind of noisy, but we still enjoyed the atmosphere.  The food was exceptional!  We ordered the Spanish Devils on horseback and the coffee confit wings for appetizers.  The wings were the BEST appetizer that we have ever ordered anywhere.  I ordered the braised lamb neck for my entree.  I'm not really a meat-eater and I usually don't eat lamb, but our server recommended it.  It was delicious and the meat practically pulled right apart!  We heard that they have a Stars Wars dinner on May 4th, and we didn't get a chance to try it this year, but it is definitely on our to-do list.  We will be dining here again!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time. We started off with the coffee confit wings and mussels, both delicious. The wings were crispy and well seasoned and the mussels were cooked perfectly with an aromatic and tasty broth.   For entrees we had the cavatelli pasta, chorizo stuffed chicken, and pork belly carbonara. All were cooked to perfection, with colorful and eye pleasing presentation, but the pork belly carbonara was our favorite of the 3.  Finishing off the meal with the flourless chocolate cake was the cherry on top of a delicious meal, and just enough for us to share and each have a few mouthfuls.   Without a doubt -- we will be back! Service was friendly, attentive, and full of great recommendations. And the atmosphere was calm and enjoyable. A+ Root 174!"}
{"text":"Root 174 has really solid, well executed food, and you can't beat the BYOB setup.    My date & I made reservations for Valentine's day; as an FYI for those of you making a reservation, I strongly suggest you request NOT to sit by the window on the right side of the restaurant; their A/C blows on your legs and we had to cover up with our coats.  The overall ambiance here is only \"meh\" in my opinion, but the food shines through.  Everything that we tried was really good.  The menu changes frequently, so I won't detail what we had, but I don't think you'll be disappointed with anything that you get.  I'd say the cuisine is modern upscale American, with the main influence being putting out really good food.    Pittsburgh's upscale dining choices are getting better & better; add this place to the list."}
{"text":"The chef's at Root are amazing, so creative and accommodating.  Most places, when you order the tasting menu, you are subject to the Chef's inspiration and cannot make any changes.  We went with friends who do not eat meat and they were able to create a wonderful vegetarian tasting menu for them.  They also catered to my girlfriend's dislike of mushrooms.  The atmosphere is great for a date night or a get together but it is a little small inside for large groups.  Parking can be difficult but we were able to get a spot on the street right in front."}
{"text":"I haven't had such an amazing meal in a while!  No lie!  I kept saying that over and over again as I was stuffing my face with the delicious food served tonight!  I swear to you I was so stuffed half way through my entree and I had to keep going because it....was...so...good....  The place describes it's dishes as comfort food.  I imagined the offerings would have a southern flair.  But the GM, Wil,l describes it as food that comforts you.  I love that!  It comforted me so much that I felt like I had to roll myself out the door!  I started with the Root Salad, which was a mix of red and golden beets, candied walnuts, goat cheese with sea salt and lime sprinkled on top.  Have I told you lately, that I love beet salads?  Like, so much!  It was incredible!    My main dish was the Ricotta Gnocchi with peas, parm, mushrooms, cherry tomato and an egg on top.  I'm usually a fan of red sauce with my gnocchi, but this blew away any red sauce I could ever have had!  The gnocchi was just how I like them, like pasta/potato cloud puffs of amazingness.  All the ingredients complimented each other so well.  No red sauce needed!  The gnocchi comes from a local hook up, so you know it's not from the frozen section of your local Giant Eagle.    The place is Incredibly intimate with seating for about 40.  Be sure to make a reservation because this place is going to fill up fast!  If you want comfort food style, look no further!"}
{"text":"I went back here for the first time in quite awhile: the food was 5 stars, but something about the ambiance/service left me a little cold.  To get the minor negatives out of the way first: 1) the service was not inattentive, but it was definitely slow at times.  There were only three tables, and the waiter kept disappearing to the kitchen so we ended up waiting quite awhile for him to take our dessert order and then later bring our check.    2) I had sky-high expectations for the ambiance, because I love the space and the tin ceilings, but it felt too brightly lit and made me feel a bit like I was in a diner, not one of the nicer places in town.  They could stand to dim the lights and dress the tables with candles a bit more.  The food was awesome though! We split the Brussels with the port reduction as an appetizer, and these were perfectly sweet and bacon-y.  I had the chorizo stuffed chicken, which was both tasty and unique, with Latin flavors and yummy grits.  The star of the night was my date's gnocchi in cream sauce with pork belly.  It was pretty close to perfect; definitely try that one."}
{"text":"I love this establishment for a list of reasons. It's quaint. The dishes are delicious and change often. The drinks are always perfect. And to save the best for last, the Star Wars artwork on the hallway to the bathroom. They make me smile every time I pass. The food, the ambiance, the drinks, every bit of it is lovely."}
{"text":"What's all the fuss about?  I love to cook.....a lot. And I do that often rather than going out to spend a couple hundred dollars to be disappointed. Often, when a new restaurant opens, especially a BYOB, we usually give it plenty of time to settle in and get the bugs (not literally) out. I have to agree that there have been an abundance of new offerings in the genre in Greater Pittsburgh over the last year, and I have liked several. After having read so many great reviews, we couldn't wait to try Root 174. We had a 5:30 reservation before the Joe and Bruce Show, so we had plenty of time. We took several of our favorite wines to begin what should be an outstanding evening. Unfortunately, Root 174 didn't quite measure up to the rest of the night. We were seated right away and attended to by our server almost immediately. He was rather vanilla in his discourse regarding the menu as well as the additions. Nothing unusual in that, except that most of the service individuals that I have encountered recently in other establishments have been outstanding in their presentations and descriptions of the menu. Having read reviews of several appetizers, we opted for the beet salad, a mushroom medley, as well as the pulled pork spring roll and the brussel sprouts. These came quickly. So far, so good. They were served fresh and they were very tasty. The entrees, on the other hand, we fairly blah. When our server was asked about the descriptions of the entrees, he didn't really have much to say. I can see why. I had the trout taco. It was dry, bland, and the presentation was totally uninteresting. I ate roughly 1/3 of it and took the rest home. My brother had ordered the pumpkin gnocci. It was also presented in a very simple fashion, although it was at least tasty. It was rather sweet and he tired of it quickly. Again, doggie bag time. My sister-in-law ordered the home made sausage. Again, presented in a very rudimentary fashion and uninteresting at best....Rather dry and bland. My wife is a non-dairy consuming pescatarian, so her selection was going to be rather bland as expected. She had the vegan meatloaf, a contradiction of itself. Perhaps it was an off night. The limited menu that night, was uninteresting at best. The service was definitely on top of it, but also rather bland and nondescript. Not sure when we'll go back for a second look. I might call and ask about the menu before I'd go."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 4 and we all ordered different things and tried each others plates.  Root 174 is ok.  But for the prices on the menu (small entrees are $25 and up), I think it's reasonable to expect more. The main courses and desserts were interesting conceptually (for example salmon sausage or chimmichurri hangar steak with tamales) but actually tasted pretty bland.   If you go, I'd recommend bringing a nice bottle of wine and sticking to appetizers including the bone marrow creme brulee and the root salad.  Those were the highlights of the meal, they were worth the money and I would gladly go back to get them again, but if I go back I would skip the pricey entrees and deserts."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Regent Square on a Saturday to have breakfast at Square Cafe, but it was so crowded and such a nice day out that we decided to take a walk to see what other restaurants were open and we stumbled onto Root 174.  I rarely go to Regent Square other than to go to Square Cafe so I wasn't even familiar with this restaurant.  We were the only patrons there on a sunny Saturday around 11:00 AM.  The interior of restaurant is intimate and somewhat cozy with a somewhat eclectic decor.    Because we were the only people there, our server and service was quick and friendly.  Unfortunately they were actually out of a couple of items on the lunch menu that day so I was unable to try the vegan \"meatloaf\" which sounded delicious.  We started with the Crispy Brussels sprouts with balsamic, and this was by far our favorite part of the meal.  The sprouts were lightly charred and the warm balsamic glaze we very flavorful.  We also shared the house salad which consisted of Mesclun green, maple black pepper vin, blue cheese, candied pecans, a port dressing.  The flavors of the salad were nice, but the actual greens were a bit sparse.  For our entrees I had the vegan falafel which was made with quinoa, and accompanied by small dollops of tzatziki, harissa, tahini, but it came as 2 small falafels in a small salad bowl rather than wrapped in the pita that was listed on the menu.  My boyfriend ordered a chorizo taco that came with 2 stacked small corn tortillas topped with some chorizo, creme fraiche, red onion, corn, and cilantro and a vegan falafel taco that also came with 2 stacked small corn tortillas topped with 2 small falafels and harissa, cilantro, and onion.  For dessert we shared a chocolate tart with some coffee.  Overall, the food was well-seasoned, inventive, and tasty, but honestly for the cost, the portions are rather small at least for lunch."}
{"text":"Here's what we liked most: The chef, generally (his name is Keith). You should go and eat his food. There are flavors and textures here (e.g., pork belly with rice crispy treat and coconut puree) that you probably haven't had in your mouth, ever. With the exception of watermelon and feta, Root's food is very creative (but also thoughtful and well edited). And if the changing menu is somehow \"nothing new for you,\" you'll still be pleasantly surprised with how the chef and his cooks execute and present top-notch product.   We also liked the seasonally-minded menu that made us feel adventurous AND comfy at the same time. You can tell what \"summer\" should taste like, and that's a great thing to see in menu planning. I expect that kind of thinking to continue into fall and winter. I'm excited to eat here again soon, and several times throughout the coming year.  The chef is friendly, makes the rounds with patrons, and the front-of-house knows the product and respects the chef without being too obnoxious about it.  The waitstaff was attentive without getting underfoot. I like their matching aprons, and the fact they replace flatware after each course.  We liked their locally-sourced cheese on an excellent cheese plate.  We liked their savory lemonade, which was perfect for summer.  We liked that they didn't charge for split plates (or half-orders, we hope), which encourages eating across the menu, something you should definitely do here because If you only order an entree, you're doing yourself an injustice.  And we liked that the chef was not afraid to serve an entree in a bowl.  Here's what we liked least: The waitstaff calling the food \"sexy,\" which is SO Top Chef Season 4. Please, don't call food \"sexy.\" Also, if you're pointing close to our food, and telling us what's on the plate as you point, make sure your nails look good, particularly if you're a man. Man up and get a manicure, or don't point so close. When pointing is \"almost touching\" you're pointing way too close to my food anyway.     Also, with competing flavors and diverse proteins on a small menu, I would really love Root NOT to be BYOB (gasp!). If they can afford the license, they ought to try wine by the glass and rotate wines with their menu, and even offer pairing suggestions. I know how people in Pittsburgh love BYOB (and hotdogs), but I love the right wine with the right dish, and that's tough with this kind of menu in a BYOB. So if you're a group of three or four or more (and you like wine at all), bring whites AND reds of different bodies.  We'd also like it if you could please find out who on your staff has the BEST handwriting and have them write the specials on the board. As it was, the specials were tough to read, the penmanship was sloppy, and the board itself looked out of place.  Root has also installed a gorgeous wood bar in the back of the space that seemingly no one would see unless they went looking for it. I'm not sure what this bar is for, since they don't serve booze, but it seems wasted right now; for example, we watched waitstaff stand behind it and polish glasses as the night wore on, which was fine. But can I eat dinner at the bar or what? What's the bar doing back there? Am I supposed to wait there if I'm waiting for a table? I don't know. No one told me.  Some things you should know about Root ahead of time, and get over: Like Legume before it, the space is still small and noisy. It's also hot in the summer (even with AC), and will be drafty in the winter (even with the heat on). For the love of God, expect it. You're going to come here to eat noteworthy, memorable food, not to speak in hushed tones about your rash in a climate-controlled box. Also, the decor is still generally lacking in charm (at least it didn't charm us). Almost everything is brown or brownish, and yet nothing seems to match anything else. The waitstaff match each other, but clash with the chef (who was out of coat that night). The walls themselves are still bare and painted brown with a sea sponge, which was admittedly kinda cool, but in the 90s. In short, the inside of Root, and whatever personality it's trying to express to the customer, is still not so very clear.  But whoa is this restaurant still phenomenal, and it's only a week old. We will give Root some time to straighten out its personality, but we will also keep eating here in the meantime. We recommend that you try to eat here as soon as you possibly can."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with the hubs to try something different. Unfortunately, the air conditioner was broken, but we ended up sitting outside in the beautiful evening weather.  For starters, we tried the creme brulee bone marrow and the mussels. The bone marrow was heavy, succulent, wonderfulness. I highly recommend it! The mussels were in a spicy, tomato sauce and plumper than most restaurants serve.   Main courses included the pork belly bahn mi- an un-made sandwich with duck liver mouse, and roast chicken breast with chick peas. Normally, we don't order chicken at restaurants because you usually get a dried out slab that I could cook better. Here, the spices were lovely and the chicken moist and cooked to perfection. The pork belly was spiced to perfection.  Desserts were fabulous too. I had a flour-less chocolate cake while the hubs tried curry ice cream with tapioca and pineapple. The cake was creamy and delicious, but the tapioca was fresh, spicy, and so different!   Our server was intuitive, friendly, and attentive and we couldn't have asked for a better dining experience."}
