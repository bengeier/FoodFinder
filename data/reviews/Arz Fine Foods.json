{"text":"Fresh? I just bought bad meat and I will return it the store tomorrow. 

This place used to be much better. It is getting worse and worse. 

Frustrated middle eastern. Already looking for a better place for middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Worst costumer service I have ever experience, we've been Arz loyal costumers for 15 years. Yesterday we wanted to return 2 bags of rice that were not open or tampered with, we brought them back and asked for a refund the young gangster guy that was at the cash decided to accused my father of trying to scam them, when we bought the rice it was $14.99 and a week later when we wanted to return it the rice was on sale and the difference between the two prices was literally $4. When we asked them to pull the records from the week before to see that we bought them at that price- they said sorry we don't have the ability to pull the records. What pissed me off the most that my parents for 15 years spend monthly at least $800 at that store and they drive from Vaughan to shop there, and then get treated like scammers over $4 I just don't understand. I shared this story with my family all my friend my work friends and on social media. We are NEVER shopping there again!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for the first time there a few weeks ago for a special family birthday celebration.  I went in on Friday to order, for a pick up on Monday evening.  I was really disappointed, It looked beautiful, a strawberry shortcake surrounded by lady finger biscuits.  The cake was frozen in the middle when we served it a few hours later.
It had only been refrigerated once we brought it home.  The lady fingers were stale.
I never dreamt they would freeze a cake I saw on Friday and sell it to me on Monday.
It was an expensive lesson.  ***** Warning State you want a FRESH CAKE!!!! ******"}
{"text":"I only ordered baklava and a ginormour macaron here so I can't really say much about the store in general. I'll be sure to check this place out again soon though."}
{"text":"A little bit expensive for Mid east groceries but its clean and has great customer service."}
{"text":"Arz is very conveniently located close to my home, which is one of the reasons why I enjoy coming here. Another reason why I enjoy  shopping here is that I can always find \"exotic\" fruits here that I have not been able to find anywhere else in Canada.

Fruits like cactus pears (yummmmm...), nisperos ( if you've never had this fruit you must definitely try it at some point),chirimoyas (a delicious and decadent custard fruit). These fruits are things that bring me back to my childhood in Peru, and make me smile :)

Another reason I love this place: Their cookie and baklava section! Its HUGE. You can buy cookies by weight (1/4lb,1/2lb,1lb) and the same goes for the baklava. Their selection of cookies is very large and I often buy them when I'm going to friend's houses for coffee. The Baklava selection is also very extensive and they are fresh and delicious. 
Baklava and Turkish coffee = a little peace of heaven :)

Being a Lebanese store, they also carry a very large selection of nuts such as pistachios (about 4 different kinds of pistachios), almonds, peanuts,cashews,pecans, you name it. They all come roasted,blanched,salted,unsalted, raw or covered in caramel...pretty much any way you want it. A large assortment of dried fruits such as apricots,figs,raisins,apples,mangoes and much more can also be found here, and they are all very good quality.Furthermore, they offer a really good selection of prepared foods such as stuffed grape leaves, stuffed hot peppers,marinated meats,baba ganoush, humus, pastries, bread and much more. 

They also have a a good olive bar with olives from different countries, a semi decent deli section and on the aisles with the regular grocery store stuff, as well some Lebanese products that I have never seen before. Also, for some reason they have really good cantaloupes here, I absolutely loooooveee cantaloupe's and every single one I've gotten from here has been delicious and beyond juicy."}
{"text":"I've been to Arz twice, to purchase a box of Baklava.  They have one of the best Baklavas in town.  It was good, half was gone by the time I got home."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of middle eastern foods. Desserts, prepared meals and spreads are all on display. Preserved lemons and olive bar. Yummy.
Upscale for this area but not too expensive"}
{"text":"One word review: Fresh! 

As in everything is fresh and made to order. 

You will not find a better place in the area for all your middle eastern and meditterrean food needs."}
{"text":"Their selection of baklawas is outstanding. These delicious bites are made with a soy-based vegetable ghee rather than butter so it's good for people who can't handle a lot of dairy. They were sweet, crispy, nutty, and just plain addictive."}
{"text":"They have some interesting fruit there.  They have fresh dates.  I didn't care for their bakery in the back.  Their baklava was expensive and stale.  Their nuts looked good quality but they were so salty.  The only thing I really liked from this place was their bread - very fresh soft pitas."}
{"text":"The staf is very friendly. Shaft manager Dina (am not sure from the name) is very friendly and lovely. I love their brand, they have nice wide collection of salads, most of the fresh squeezed juices (try the apple juice, so yummy), they have good offers between times. Also the store manger, is very friendly, with a smily face, helpful, and understandable.

Its a nice small super market, with a great deals, and with a resturant."}
{"text":"Nice little Lebanese bakery & cafe. Service is friendly and can't complain about the value. The treats are yummy. Great alternative to the usual spots in Scarborough."}
{"text":"I dont understand the low rating for this place!! the stuff they have is awesome! everything is fresh and all the sweets are home made or made in store , and comes out warm!! Everything from olives to bread, to baklava was amazing! people were really nice and knew what they were talking about  when it came to the products they sold. If I lived in Toronto I would go there every single day!!"}
{"text":"Although it calls itself a bakery, Arz is really a supermarket that specializes in bakery items. The desserts I have had from here are outstanding, from cakes to baklava. 

Another must-try are the various prepared Arab specialities in the deli like grape leaves, hummus, and baba ghanoush. Fantastic olive and cheese selection, too.

Pick one: cheap or high quality. Anyone complaining about the prices does not respect the superior quality of what you get here. IMO the deli here far exceeds the quality of Adonis. Yes, it is expensive, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Parking is a nightmare.
Produce is priced very expensive.
Verdict = if you're not shopping for any middle eastern goods, you should avoid this place. If so, you'd probably find the same middle eastern goods you're looking for, for much cheaper at Adonis (Warden & Eglinton)."}
{"text":"This is a super super neat place!

I came in looking for some ingredients for an Iranian dish I'd like to make and was quite impressed with the store. Half of it is groceries and the other half is a bakery and takeout area. They have a ton of baked goods, and also a huge selection of items like olives and nuts and seeds behind glass, which is way more hygienic than the giant open bins of the stuff you usually see. I was able to get the ingredients I was looking for (dried limes and sumac powder) pretty easily and they came to about $5 for both. 

I'm sure I'll be back the next time I need ingredients for a recipe or want 18 kinds of baklava and olives.

My only annoyance is that you can only get into the parking lot from Lawrence and it's  that kind of slanted parking which makes it annoying to back out of your spot."}
{"text":"***Warning*** If you have diabetic friends, be sure to AVOID this place.

Arz is a supermarket with a huge sugar mountain of baklava and other sweets waiting to tempt you.  They have a selection of strange fruits that I have never seen before, but that wasn't the reason I was here today.

As Wayne C. mentioned, the display of baklavas is visually appealing and formed into cake tiers.  I ended up walking away with a box of 6 that I chose myself.  For those who are indifferent, they have pre-packaged ones but they came in trays of 20 and 40s and I just couldn't fathom the aftermath if I had bought a tray of these.  Just one \"little\" cube of baklava packs in \"big\" flavour.  If you're having these with coffee, skip the sugar because otherwise you'll fall into a sugar comatose!

Parking can be a bit of a problem as their parking lot is a one-way street and spaces are limited."}
{"text":"Fresh deserts.  Not too sweet.  Yummy.  Had a plate of baklava and other goodies.  Only shared reluctantly."}
{"text":"My biggest problem with this store was accessibility. The front of the building is not far from a sidewalk. However the entrance is at the back corner of the building. 

To get to the entrance, I had to push my baby's stroller up a bit of a slope, and then behind cars parked in angle parking. I was worried that if one of the cars backed out, that my baby and I would be hit by a car. It looks as though at one point in time there was an entrance that was near the sidewalk but throughout the years I guess they did renovations and moved it.

I had a falafel in the little cafe section and it was good. However there are lots of other falafel/shawarma places in the area so I will probably go to one of those next time."}
{"text":"Arz Fine Foods is your go to place for all things Middle Eastern. 

This pace is part grocery store, bakery, deli and café. Being of Middle Eastern descent I am no stranger to this place and have been coming here ever since I can remember. The grocery section is pretty small focusing mostly on Middle Eastern ingredients. If you are attempting to cook a Middle Eastern dish and need a particular ingredient they will have it for sure. These guys also make some of the best pita bread around; it is so fresh and reasonably priced. In addition to groceries they also have a large deli counter where one can get cured meats, cheeses as well as some prepared Lebanese foods (i.e salads, dips etc) to take home. I love their deli section as I can get some of the Lebanese cheeses I grew up eating (mostly white salty cheeses). 

The real kicker of this place is the sweets section, in addition to cakes, pastries and western cookies they also have a HUGE selection of baklava and other Middle Eastern desserts. It is very difficult to walk by these desserts and not buy any. They truly do make some of the best baklava in the city, just be careful those things may look bite sized but they pack a ton of sugar and butter. In addition to all this greatness they also have a small hot table in the back of the store if one feels like having lunch, they even have a small patio to sit and enjoy your lunch or Arabic coffee. 

The store itself is a good size but the amount of things it contains does give it a cramped feel. The isles are narrow, there are many interesting smells, and most of the staff communicates in Arabic which gives this place an old world charm. The service however could be better as when this place is busy the staff tend to run around like chickens with their heads cut off. Once I made an order for some special bread and when I went to pick it up they had given it to someone else, if you are placing a special order ahead of time make sure you speak to a manager to ensure that it gets done. Overall though this is one of my favourite grocery stores to frequent."}
{"text":"I've never been her before but it was worth the trip. 
Firstly, the cafe area is pretty small, and felt a bit cramped.
Secondly, its so easy to spend allot of money of here, everything is delicious.
Thirdly, there are so many tasty things to try and buy. 

They have some cheeses and spices that you wouldn't find in your local grocery store, although I think Loblaws carries their brand now in the international section. I would suggest the mini pizzas, and the shawarma plates, as well as the middle eastern sweets. My daughter loved the sweets but didn't like the spicy cheese rolls. I enjoyed most of the food; their were some things that seemed a bit tangy for me- like pickles. I also tried middle eastern coffee, but I wasn't to thrilled about it. It was like drinking mud, I'll stick to Italian for coffee.

Overall, you should spend an afternoon going through the place, you'll be surprised at what you'll find. Lots to explore, will be back again."}
{"text":"I now understand why my Friend Sugar Overlord(Aka Sugar Overload... Aka Diabetes Waiting to Happen) gave this place 4 ***Stars***.  The back end of this Grocery/Bakery store has an aesthetically pleasing selection of Cookies, Cakes and BAKLAVA.  These Baklavas were displayed in Cake Tiers format AND it wasn't just \"ONE\" of them but several of them side by side with an assortment of flavours.

Baklavas are so SWEET that one of these Sugar Cube size desserts probably contains 10x its sugar contain in weight.  Talk about your silent killer!  But please use this information for Good rather than Evil unless you really have someone unpleasant in mind.  You can give them these treats and they wouldn't even know what hit them.

The PARKING here is to be desired but I'm not the one driving.   :P   Once inside this place, a Lebanese Middle East amateur like myself took time to adapt to the environment but it's interesting to see such things like Twisted Cheeses, Maneesh, etc...

3.5'd because an old Lady try to run me over with her cart.  How can such a sweet place have such evil customers?"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Expensive though.  Great cheeses and nuts.  Interesting selection.  Prepared foods I've tried have been very good."}
{"text":"Decent middle eastern grocery store. They have almost everything you might look for.Not everything taste as good as it looks so dont get too excited. Not bad overall"}
{"text":"This is another great Lebanese-Middle Eastern store. Where Arz Bakery shines is in the baked goods. It is the only place in Toronto (probably not!), where Baba au Rhum are almost always available. They make beautiful pastries and their have a awesome selection of small cookies (mignonnes). All this is beautifully presented in an environment that only Adonis in Montreal can compete with. They naturally feature all the Middle Eastern sweets that a lot of us crave.

They also have a great selection of cheeses, prepared foods, and mezzes. In the back or side there is a coffee shop making with a few seats that makes a fine expresso and offers a few comestibles.

They also carry a full range of specialty groceries and a nice selection of fresh vegetables.

Where this store shines a bit more than Nasr, is that it is much more elegantly set up and the merchandise beautiful displayed. This look a tiny bit like a Mediterranean Pusateri, but the price are much in line with its direct competition and the general market.

If you would like to set a beautiful table for an afternoon tea, with gorgeous little pastries, this is the place to get them. It is a must especially if you are in the areas shopping at Nasr. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent pitas.  Nice selection of ethnic foods.  Hot food area is delicious.  Good for quick lunch or snack."}
{"text":"Great selection of products but extremely overpriced also prices advertised and what you get charged are 2 different things. Won't be back thanks."}
{"text":"Went in 2X in a month for sweets. It was a little busy considering it was a weekday.  Hardly anyone behind the counters, not sure why.  During my first visit I had saw a lot of staff who were very attentive.  Bought ma'mool and baklava including side dishes but was a little disappointed on the hot food;over salted.  For some reasons one of the ma'mool that I ate had too much rosewater tasting as well but I still really liked it.  I love the store considering it's clean and have so much variety of different foods."}
{"text":"As a grocery store for middle eastern food I think arz is great. You can find lots of products and it always seems fairly fresh. The prepared food or the cafe portion of the store was not great. We ordered chicken shawarma wraps and fries. The gentleman working said they had to fries at the moment because we didn't want to wait for the oil to heat up since he had already turned the fryer off....uhh ok.... it wasn't like they were closing, it was 4pm! Anyways we get the wraps and inside my wrap was about 5-6 FRENCH fries!! He then looked at me and winked as if he did me a favour. The fries were left over fries that he found where?? I know he didn't fry them up fresh! All in all I will shop at the store but not eat at their cafe again! Shawarma was not great anyway and given the area you can find a much better place to eat!"}
{"text":"Oh wow! Talk about quality and selection. 
Great place to go as a single guy with a middle eastern background who has grown up here.
I was able to pick up some delicious cookies and grab some cheese and olives from their incredible deli section. 
The staff were very friendly and made me feel like home. 
Definitely beats the big box stores!"}
{"text":"Arz is simply amazing. Don't be deceived by the \"bakery\" - it's actually a full supermarket. With a great lunch counter (though no Arabic coffee) and a massive selection of cookies, cakes, and other treats as well. It's simply a joy to visit to find Middle Eastern items you might not easily find elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get groceries. The prices are reasonable and the selection is great. Anything I need is here. The meat is delicious and fresh. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mediterranean food stores I've been into and that includes San Francisco, Vancouver and Toronto.
The variety and prices keep us coming back. The customer service has never been anything but fantastic.

There is a separate order counter for nuts and deserts, an island of olive selections, and homemade prepared foods.

The store is well organized, bright and clean. It's owned by Lebanese, but has products from all over the middle east, the biggest variety that I have seen under one roof. There is also a bakery in the back with tables to rest and chat."}
{"text":"Oh, man.  I've never been here before but my dad requested some pita and I just popped in to pick them up for him before heading down for Easter.  

Oh, wow.  The sounds and smells just took me home.  Plus their kibbeh were delicious.  Seriously, it was a joy. I could stock up here for months."}
{"text":"I love coming here for my Lebanese groceries! 

They have the freshest Pita Bread and freshly made sauces and spreads like Hummus, Garlic Sauce, Tahini, Baba Ganoush

I love buying all the ingredients and making home made shawarma for my family and myself. 

They also have a really great selection of Olives, Coffee and Middle Eastern desserts like Baklava.  

Parking is a bit tight here"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to buy tiramisu cake. They have a wide selection of baklava which I only bought once since they're so expensive. I've also tried some of their other cakes (such as their opera cake) but I always go back to their tiramisu cake.

Although it's called Arz Bakery, it's really more of a grocery store. I've purchases pistachios here and they're also very good.

They also have a small cafe in the corner of the store but I've never purchased coffee here so I don't know how good it is."}
{"text":"My second visit to Arz was significantly less bustlin' than the first.  There was actually a spot in their somewhat sketchy lot, this time I visited on a weekday, during the day.  AND workers definitely outweighed the actual shoppers.  Maybe only a handful of patrons inside.

I skipped the produce and headed straight to the impressive displays of baklava, cakes, and cookies.  I suspect that at least the cakes are brought in as the place is lacking a distinct smell of baking!

(A friend that I was with bought some baklava, but I waited for Pastisserie Royale...which is down the street.  Shh...)

I went to the café, at the back of the store, with the intentions of eating a Kanafeh sandwich (??) - had it during my first visit, it was delicious! - but then changed my mind 'cause the café seemed eerily quiet and no one asked if I needed anything.  Missed customer service op!

Ended up buying, then splitting a bag of what I think were olive oil soaps.  Looked fairly rustic, no label, so I really don't know what they're made of.  Oh well, it was only $8 for 6 square bars of soap, so no big loss.

Overall, maybe it as just the timing, but I think they may have changed owners 'cause it was awfully quiet."}
{"text":"Parking lot at this place is a nightmare.  Lots of hustle and bustle with buggies and people like being in heavy traffic!  No surprise, this place has everything one could want from the Middle-East.  I treated myself to a nice, rich Mohalabia (dessert made with milk, sugar, pistachio, rosewater and mastika).  The essence and delicate fragrance soothes one's spirit.  The meat counter is good, but fairly expen$ive.  They have SAHLAB which I love in the winter - made with hot milk ... mmmm.  Got simit (ka'ak) bread, tons of loukoum including one made with roses, one with saffron ... you name it!  Freshly made halva ... different syrups including pomegranate syrup which is one of my all-time faves.  They also carry my favourite Middle-Eastern cream cheese - \"Puck\".  Love it!  THAT is cream cheese.  Everything you could want from the Middle-East - also saw some pressed, flattened figs.  OMG.  I could go totally crazy in here and spend thou$ands if left to my own device$ ..."}
{"text":"Nice bakery, large selection of cakes and all kind of delicious desserts.
I ordered my wife's Birthday cake and this is by far the best vanilla and chocolate glazed cake ever!!!!"}
{"text":"The baklava here is alright. A bit pricey for my taste, but acceptable. They have a decent range here. Price depends on which specific sort. The line up for fresh baklava can get fairly busy for holidays, such as Eid. 

I haven't really tried their other sweets at their bakery other than the baklava. The ones I did try are not really memorable. The rice pudding is standard fare. Personally, I would stick with the baklava as that appears to be freshest and has the greatest turnover rates. The cakes and cookies in the corner of the store appear a bit dry and untouched. 

The place is split into two functions: part grocery, part bakery. Everyone pays through the cashiers at the front near the entrance. They do also have a little cafe.

I come here mostly because the location is relatively nearby my house."}
{"text":"They have good stuff in here. Anything I want and I can't find anywhere else, I always come in here to get it. Best middle eastern cousin!"}
{"text":"Everything looks exotic to me at Arz Bakery Ltd. 

Don't be fool by the name \"Bakery\", it is really a Supermarket that sells everything!! So if you want to cook up a Lebanese-Middle Eastern meals.. this is the to go to place to get all your supplies!

Arz Bakery Ltd as a Bakery really shine with proud display of honey infused goods and desserts... just looking at them give me Sugar High! 

There is also a coffee bar set up with Hor'devours at the back of the store. A lot of older looking gentlemen hanging out there drinking arabic coffee! 

Parking is an issue here in the small, tight parking lot!"}
{"text":"Arz has just about everything you would expect in a middle eastern food store, plus much much more.  The Deli section is good, where they have labneh (a pressed yogurt, which by the way is fantastic for thickening red sauce), tzatziki, and chicken kebabs, ready to grill.  Also falafel and pickles.
The seeds and nuts is almost overwhelming, as there is every type imaginable.  Then there are the pastries.  I have yet to try any save the baklava, which looked like art in pastry form.  
There is also a grocery section and a little sit-in eating area.  This is MUCH more than a bakery, in fact, I only think of it secondarily as such.
prices can tend to be a little higher on certain items, but overall fairly reasonable."}
{"text":"The small cafe itself does not have a large variety of food...mainly small Lebanese/Middle Eastern items like chicken shwarma pockets, mini pizzas, and spicy cheese rolls. They also offer small shawarma plates. There is a small seating area outside and inside as well. The cafe would be 3/5.

The rest of Arz is a Lebanese grocery that sells everything from shwarma meat to make your own at home, varieties of fresh olives, baklava, pastries, and your regular grocery items.

Well worth a drop in if you live in the area and want some specialty goods from the Middle East."}
{"text":"This place is really important to me as a Lebanese person. Great options for products and fresh pita bread. The bakery and deli have a wide variety of option and really good food. The staff has always been great. Love this place."}
{"text":"first visit.  
8 different kinds of zaatar, hummus and babaganush like I'm home,  though they should use more garlic.  
best pitas i had since i got back from Israel.
stuffed veggie selection they made me sorry I'm  not staying here longer.  
fresh produce are great!  
a small cafe on site, wit coffees, ice creams and a small seating area.  
good."}
