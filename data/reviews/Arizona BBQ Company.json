{"text":"I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is one of the better BBQ joints in the East Valley. We absolutely love the BBQ sauce bar and the brisket is very good. One weakness is the size of the sides, they are a little on the smaller side. However, they are really enjoyable. One other thing I enjoyed was the roasted jalapeños they serve with the BBQ. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been looking for s good BBQ place...FOUND IT!! I had the brisket...delicious! The potato wedges were awesome too! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to say it, better than Joe's. GO NOW! We've gotten an array of items and all are stellar. We order out from here pretty much every week."}
{"text":"I love it, but it is hard to find.  You cannot see it from the street, but put the address in your gps and find it.  
 The menu has the usual bbq selections,  as well as side dishes.   Both times, my wife and I requested a substitution, and we were eagerly accommodated.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable with regard to how the food was cooked and to what the ingredients were. 

We tried a combo plate the first time, with pulled pork, ribs, and brisket.  Loving brisket, we ordered a second order of it since we were splitting the dish.  My goal was to figure out what to order on a sandwich or to decide what was best, but I was not able to determine a favorite.  Yet... 

The meat is not overly smoked. Instead of a strong smoke taste,  you will find a more subtle tender taste.  This is a matter of preference, but we found it to be a very nice difference from other bbq places.
If you are trying to not eat carbs, this is the place to go.  Slabs and slabs of delicious meat!  Keep in mind, that if that is your goal, do not under any circumstances order the cornbread muffins, as they were hard to resist. 

The place was amazingly clean, had a bar with nice microbrews, and we were able to eat both times on a Friday without waiting.  I wish they had a patio, so perhaps that could be possibility, as it would be a quiet one away from traffic.
All in all, great place to eat, since so far you will do not have to wait for a great meal, but I am sure that will soon change."}
{"text":"If you're on your way down to Famous Dave's you need to stop. You're going to get way more food and a much higher quality right here. Some other reviewers have commented on the prices but you need to weigh that with the quantity you get here. Sandwiches are large and you're going to want to take some home. Interesting sauces like chipotle, habanero, and green chili. Son had the brisket sandwich, my wife the pulled pork and I had the combination of both. Meats were very tender and brisket was not overly fatty. Wife got hers AZ style with coleslaw and jalapeños. Loved it! Had to take half of it home. Potato wedges are not over cooked as some have stated. They are fried in some kind of pork fat or the like that makes them crispy and delicious!
Restaurant was very clean and not real busy when we were there for an early dinner. Despite having an order station and pick up window, Patrick delivered our food to us. Even came back to check on us while we were eating. Good service for that type of set up. 
This is now our barbecue place in Gilbert and looking forward to going back and trying more items. Skip the mediocre food at Dave's and long lines at Joe's."}
{"text":"Better than Joes in downtown Gilbert and they have awesome craft beers on draft! I've had the pig mac burger and the brisket so far and it's amazing.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ that just falls off the bone, moist and tender. Nice ambient, clean, and great service. Ribs, chicken, shredded pork, and brisket are all awesome! Multiple sauces to choose from. I like sweet and tangy, while wife likes habanero sauce. Potato wedges are crunchy on the outside while not dry inside. The best part, the hallway decor to bathrooms."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit here. The food is delicious!! Love the location, so close to our house.  The staff is very friendly and give great service. I had the southwestern Cesar salad, tastes amazing"}
{"text":"We Yelp searched this for supper our first night in the area, just a 10-minute drive from our hotel and we hit the jackpot! We couldn't have been happier! we cleaned our plates and vowed to come back, and so we did day 5 of our vacation we hit there again and it was just as good as the first time. Everything's piping hot, tender and juicy never dried out.... clean, attentive atmosphere. this one's going to be a real winner when it catches on and the place will always be packed! A choice of Bbq sauces is another plus. We had the half rack of ribs and shared it and it was plenty but we also had pork tacos and they are the best but the best side is there potato wedges! big with crunchy edges delicious! The baked beans are good too and the corn muffin is awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow. Best BBQ in Phoenix bar none. We got a huge sampler platter for only $20 with pulled pork, ribs, half a chicken and brisket. The smoke ring on the brisket was the brightest and thickest I've ever seen. The sides are fantastic (try the mac and the wedges!) and come with the platter. Get the green chili!!!!!! I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that opened up close to our house so we decided to give it a try. I had the pulled pork sandwich and potato wedges and tried the Chipotle and Sweet and tangy sauce. My husband had the brisket with beans and coleslaw and tried the Colorado sauce. We also added a cookie and brownie for dessert. Everything we had was incredibly good. Service was excellent, the restaurant was decorated in a very cool Southwest way. Very very happy with our experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pork and brisket were both very good. We had the black bean corn salad and coleslaw, which were very fresh tasting, and chicharron, which was also good. The sauces were all very good."}
{"text":"We were looking for BBQ and found this place on Yelp. Food was great. You can eat in or take out."}
{"text":"Yummmy!!! High quality BBQ meats! Many varierties of flavourful sauces, big thick potato wedges, mac and cheese, homemade cornbread! plus many other sides. The food is Amazing! This place is truely a hidden gem. It's family owned and operated. Everyone here is super friendly and really cares about every person that walks in. Our favorite place to go when we crave MEAT! Great for athletes wanting a protein boost! or anyone looking for a hot tasty meal. THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Love the roasted pepper with meal. The meat was juicy and delicious, great choice of sauces. Yummy sides, even got some extra giant cornbread muffins to take home."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Delicious food, great chicken and potato wedges are addicting! Needed food to feed a small crew and this hit the spot!"}
{"text":"If you like dry rub you have to try the ribs here, super yummy!!!! Great quiet atmosphere where you can actually hear the people you are having a meal with.  The pulled pork is worth the trip as well."}
{"text":"Nice to have another BBQ choice in Gilbert. Had the platter with brisket, ribs and pulled pork. Added the Chipotle potato salad and corn muffin. Didn't care for the brisket. It was very fatty with no consistency when you bit into it...almost soggy. The ribs were good but maybe a little to much smoke. Pulled pork was excellent. Potato salad was crunchy. Not sure if under cooked or the way it was intended. Corn muffin was huge and very good.
May give it another try"}
{"text":"I called in an order to go for 2 tacos and a side. I ordered a brisket and a pork belly with a side of the chili mac n cheese. When I arrived I was told they didn't have pork belly which was the one I wanted more so I was a little bummed. I replaced that with chicken. Everything was ready very quick. 

I got the chipotle BBQ sauce and habanero. I used the chipotle on the brisket taco which I ate first. It had plenty of brisket and the slaw added just enough crunch. Next I ate the chicken with the habanero sauce. The taco without the sauce was okay. It didn't have as much flavor as the brisket but you could taste the chicken and it was moist. Once I added the habanero sauce it helped but then kinda overpowered the rest. The mac was good, in glad it had plenty of bacon because it needed the salty kick. 

It was just over $9 and I think the cost for the brisket taco is worth it but I wouldn't pay $3+ for the chicken taco again. I also really hope they add the pork belly that was on the menu online because it sounds good! 

I'll be back to try some regular BBQ for sure just based off the brisket I tasted in the taco. It was tender with nice flavor."}
{"text":"The best BBQ place I have found in AZ!! The food is amazing. I have found that the prices are VERY reasonable and you get a ton of meat!! So many places skimp on meat these days, but AZ BBQ loads it on! I always have leftovers. Keep it up, guys! I love coming here!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!  The pork is melt in your mouth tender and the variety of sauces is great too!  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork is the best I have had, and you get to cover it with several homemade styles of BBQ sauce. If you're a BBQ nut like me, you have to visit Arizona BBQ Company. First responders and military get a discount, this is a wonderful way to say thank you to our heros."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and there weren't a lot of people in- we figured it'd be quick and easy like most BBQ places. Husband and I both ordered the superstition combo, which includes pulled pork, ribs, brisket, and tortillas as well as two sides. None of the meat has sauce on it, you choose the sauce you want at the sauce bar. 
The food took over 15 minutes to get to us, which felt like a really long time considering it's a BBQ place where everything is pre-made and there were no orders ahead of us- everyone in the restaurant was already eating. Food comes out and it's subpar at best- I think my biggest issue were the sauces which weren't very good. Overall everything tasted super mediocre, and considering the high rating for the place I was super let down."}
{"text":"Oir 3rd time here. We are pleasantly surprise with the tenderness, juiciness, great flavour of their meats, and consistency with warm and efficient service.

Great happy hour too! ^_^"}
{"text":"This was some of the best brisket and ribs I've had in a long long time  and the price was right. The food was available extremely quickly and you really get fed. Friendly reasonably priced. Take that back more than reasonably priced. I've wasted this kind of money at to many fast food places and their stuff, lets face it, is crap.  This guy is an artist. It's clear he takes great pride in the product that he puts out. you really need to  check him out.  if you have any appreciation for good barbecue this will be your home base."}
{"text":"This place is SO good!!!! Good BBQ is hard to find but this place is the real deal. It's a must!"}
{"text":"Just tried for the first time and unfortunately I 've had better.  Alot better if you go to Joes.  The pulled pork was good, just nothing special. The ribs were and chicken were both very dry. It appears their food sits for too long making items over cooked. The brisket was greasy, I imagine it sits in a pan of juice with alot of grease to stay warm.  Tried four sides and all were very bland.  The coleslaw was just vinegar flavor and the mac cheese had sat too long. Not creamy, but dry and no flavor.  Mac n cheese needs to be creamy, not crispy on the sides from staying warm.  Last was the sauces.  Tried 5 of the 6 available and mustard, green chili and sweet/tangy were decent.  Chipotle and colorado just spice not the bbq you want.  Tortillas had been wrapped in tinfoil for some time. Again, dry and stuck together from too long in the foil.  The staff were very nice, the place is clean. However, bbq is all about flavor, lean and being tender.  This place just does not meet our standards."}
{"text":"Happened to come by this place recently but didn't try it until today.  I liked it!  I'm excited that there is a place like this right around the corner and I see myself as a frequent customer going forward.  

I'm not really a BBQ connoisseur but I do enjoy it.  I just ordered to go today.. Got the 4 peaks platter and 2 tacos.. 1 pulled pork, 1 chicken.  Sides were the giant cornbread muffin and the potato salad.  I sampled pretty much everything I ordered and enjoyed it all.  I really enjoyed the honey sause and the green chili.. Will try the others in the future.  The smoked chicken was amazing.. Fall off the bone.  All of the meats were tender and tasty.. Never had chicken like that before though.. Kudos!  

It's not super fancy inside.. but what BBQ place is or should be?  No frills, but certainly not a dive.. could use a bit more character though.. Not that I'm complaining about the decor.. It was fine!  

Customer service was great! A nice young lady greeted me at the door, gave me a menu, and explained a few things.  Same for who took my order and the guy who delivered my food at the pickup window.  

Seems like a nice operation so far.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Really lovely inside.  The kitchen is spotless.  Loved the pork brisket sandwich.  Mac and cheese was delicious.  Terrific experience!"}
{"text":"Brisket Tacos are killer!!! Potato wedges are amazing!!! All in all an amazing BBQ place!!!"}
{"text":"So my hubby and I just went. It's a counter order kind of place where you help yourself to silverware, napkins, & sauces. People were very friendly, food came out very quick, like under 10 min. Place was only 1/4 full on an early Friday night. The sides were pretty good, mac n cheese was very good and had bacon, potato wedges were huge and crunchy, chipotle potato salad could have used salt but otherwise flavorful, and corn was buttery and cooked well(didn't taste as described). 

The meat...we each got sampler platter $20 bucks each, lots of food we each ate only half, but very very bland. The meat was soft & fall of the bone but almost no flavor. The chicken tasted boiled but maybe broiled a couple minutes after, shredded pork and brisket no flavor and ribs were very lightly seasoned. Not impressed with flavor of the bbq sauces, needed depth and a tad sweet. The honey mustard was ok, slightly bitter. Unfortunately we won't be back. I did hear another couple say they loved the food. It did not smell like bbq outside/inside, which is usually a sign. The people seemed so nice but the meat and sauces are a 3.
If this place just heavily seasoned their meat, put out 2 more flavorful, richer homemade sauces, added some homemade ranch and maybe a different salad choice that doesn't have beans and corn it would be a 5 star. If ya'all change let me know, I would try again."}
{"text":"Walked into the new restaurant and was warmly  greeted with a heartfelt welcome.  Looked around the restaurant and liked the look.  It's not overly decorated with tons of stuff that boggles the mind with overload of junk on the walls.   I like the toned down look.    The cashier was super friendly.   Out came the food.  Portions are large enough to fill a tummy.   The mac n cheese is one of my favorites.
There were plenty of self serve sauces to satisfy any tastebud.  We tried a bunch of different meats and they were all awesome!  We left with smiles and full tummies. 

Go try out this place you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place! The portions are huge, we realized on our second visit that two adults could split one of the combo's even still it's reasonably priced and of course delicious! Our favorite meats are the ribs, brisket and pulled pork. I also really love the chicharones and the chipotle sauce."}
{"text":"Easily the best BBQ joint in Arizona. The brisket was spot on. Sauces were all amazing and the green chili, well, I tired to steal it. As a native New Mexican and a huge BBQ fan, this place crushes. Dominates. Meat miracle. Sauces made by unicorns.  All wrapped up in magic.  

Oh, $4 draft local beers too. All the more evidence that leprechauns really exist. 

Run there. Right now."}
{"text":"I had a fun enjoyable evening here with a bunch of food bloggers. My first impression when walking in was that this place pays a nice tribute to Arizona. The decor is southwestern with a fun board listing Arizona facts and history. The restaurant itself is very simple and comfortable (great for kids!) with counter order service and a bar located to one side. The owners are longtime Gilbert residents and they opened this place to give back to the surrounding community. I was here for a buffet style dinner so I don't have a lot of info on portion sizes of their platters, but their menu prices seem very reasonable to other BBQ restaurants. I felt very welcome here and Colette was great at sharing her passion for this place to us. Even though I came here for BBQ, I was immediately drawn to the tray of green chili bacon man n' cheese. I'm huge mac n' cheese guy and I thought it was fantastic. Not too spicy but nice and cheesy with lots of flavor. We also tried their black bean and corn salad, brisket and pulled pork. These guys definitely know their BBQ and do a great job of capturing the flavors of the southwest. The BBQ comes naked as they have a condiment bar with different flavors of BBQ sauce. My favorites were the sweet and tangy and habanero sauces. Overall this was a great experience and I wish this place was open back when I had a house in the adjacent neighborhood. AZ BBQ Co. accepts non-perishable foods that they donate to a local food bank. Just another way they try to give back."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, great sides, great small joint hidden away in Gilbert. All the meat is great. The selection of sauces is nice and all of them unique and flavorful. The ribs and brisket are some of the best around. There is a lot of good BBQ around east valley, but this is definitely one of the better ones."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I ordered takeout, the corn muffins are amazing and the brisket was really good. However I don't quite under stand why the serve the plates with tortilla instead or a corn muffin. It is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue. Impressive portions - all very tasty.  New place- but don't let that stop you."}
{"text":"Potato wedges are cooked to perfection! Crispy ^-^ had the pulled pork, tender, mmmmmm, sauces are awesome. Looking at my brother and nephews platter, wow!! Next time I'm getting a plate too LoL good foods!!"}
{"text":"Good portions, fresh, clean, tasty, total worth trying and reasonable prices. I really enjoyed the coleslaw, the tacos are tasty, the fries were very good, the bun for the sandwiches seemed to have a hint of seasoning which I enjoyed as well. Reasonable wait times and staff was courteous."}
{"text":"Husband and I went after work, no one was there, pretty quiet.  My husband had the ribs, he was not happy, they were mostly fat, a lot left on the tray.  He liked the beans.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw.  Pulled pork was dry, even after pouring bbq sauce on and the coleslaw had a lot of raw onion and made with a vinegar sauce.  Neither of us liked it.  On a good note, had the brisket chili FANTASTIC!  would love to grab more for lunch this week."}
{"text":"This place is all about the sauces.  Loved the habanero and green chili sauces.  The meat quality is good and tender for the most part. The different sauce choices was what made this place interesting and unique.

Getting free chicharonns were pretty good for checking in here.  They're crispy with really good flavors. They also serve it to you when it's warm, so it's super good.  Be sure to eat it before it gets cold.

Try one of the combos if it's your first time.  The brisket, pulled pork and briskets were all pretty tasty and tender.  It's a bonus to dip them in the habanero sauce as well.  Just the right about of kick.  I wasn't a big fan of the smoked chicken.  Didn't taste all that special.  The green chili mac 'n cheese was just average.  Extra green chili sauce mixed in there added more flavors though.  The potato wedges were awesome.  You can either dip them in the BBQ sauces or green chili.  Either way, it was a real treat."}
{"text":"Their meats were all awesome. The sauces were tasty. The loss of a star was simply due to their lack of good sides. Everything was southwest flavored and all I really wanted was a good old fashioned mac salad or potato salad. Their mac and cheese was good. They were a bit on the pricey side IMO. Their ribs, brisket and pulled pork were outstanding. They do have chicharones, which I regret not ordering."}
{"text":"I was looking for a local BBQ place since moving back to Queen Creek. This place is awesome! Fall off the bone ribs, juicy brisket and crispy pulled pork. The pulled pork reminds me of carnitas. The combos are served with two sides, tortillas and a grilled jalapeño. Great Arizona BBQ. I can really get behind this Arizona BBQ concept. I chose the wedges and Mac n cheese for my sides. The wedges were amazing. Perfectly seasoned and crispy on the outside. The Mac n cheese was very good too. To top it off, they have three different BBQ sauces: sweet and tangy, chipotle and habanero. My favorite is the habanero. Try them all! They also have green chile sauce to complement any tacos. Reasonable prices and fast/friendly service. You can't go wrong with this place. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab some local barbecue! I had the baked potato with pulled pork and habanero BBQ sauce (not as spicy as I expected). Husband had a combo platter with brisket, pulled pork and chicken. Both were incredibly good, and the prices are really reasonable. Looking forward to our next visit, which will probably be tonight! I've got my eye on the Pig Mac, and I suspect husband will be digging into some ribs!"}
{"text":"Now this is good BBQ! Came for the first time tonight -
Loved every minute of it. This restaurant is new to town, and can't turn down the opportunity to try BBQ! We were greeted immediately upon entering. Grab a menu and place an order at the counter. When ready, they call out your number to come pick it up. The food was incredible! The portions were extremely large - my wife and I both took half our meal to go. The staff continually walked around asking how the food was and if we needed anything. The service was solid, and quick. Food was fairly priced, as well, compared to other BBQ joints around. The location is just off the road, not the easiest to spot on your first visit. We loved it though and will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food! Mac and cheese is one of the best we've had. Also highly recommend the ribs, pulled pork, and chicken. Brisket was decent, but not bad. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I know something about BBQ and can testify that this place, while simple and even a little stark, serves GREAT BBQ! My half rack was perfectly smoked and cooked, my wife's pulled pork was tender and juicy. Good selection of tasty sauces. Large fried steak potatoes were best we've had. Honestly! Oh... and the cornbread muffin is an absolute MUST! Not much of a beer selection, but ok. Reasonably priced. We'll be back... soon!"}
{"text":"The ribs fell off the bone so easily, the pulled porky was so yummy, but the brisket was the best part. The cornbread muffin was really yummy and fresh and I can't remember having better mac n cheese. All around awesome meal and super reasonably priced. They even had ribs as a kids meal instead of just your typical chicken finger basket. New favorite place for sure."}
{"text":"I take my BBQ serious being from Kansas City and this restaurant did not disappoint. I ordered the ribs and brisket. Both were delicious and my wife loves the different sauce choices. I used my regular Gates & Sons sauce from Kansas City. The service was quick and they were very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great place with better bbq than your \"famous\" bbq places. Kinda hidden location behind a circle K Inside a strip mall in the corner of Val vista and Ray. The food is delicious and they also serve alcohol. Definitely recommend this place if you love bbq!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. 
When I got home, my 0NE POUND OF BRISKET looked very small. Weighed on my electronic kitchen scale at 9 ounces In the container. 
The 1/2 of CHICKEN I ordered turned turned out to be a serving of CHOPPED CHICKEN. 
The CORN tortillas were FLOUR. The coleslaw lacked dressing. None at all. 
The Cornbread muffin was delicious. 
Taste is a subjective thing. What suits one person may not interest another, but that being said.... I did not find either the brisket or the chicken  particularly flavorful and generally disappointing. 
They do offer a large variety of sauces, but when the meat is bland, sauces will only coat bland meat, which is what we found. 
In defense of the company, I did contact the manager who said he would \"make it good\" next time I came in. IF... the food was first rate, I would go back to get what is owed me, but the food isn't worth going back for more flavorless, super-fatty brisket. 
I paid $17 for 9 ounces of brisket and $11 for a small mound (roughly 3 oz) of chopped chicken, dry cabbage and a corn muffin. 
Won't be going back..."}
{"text":"Really good food. Many BBQ places cover their meat with sauce to cover up inferior cooking. No need here. You want a smoke ring, You get smoke. Sides were delicious too."}
{"text":"We saw this very cute new Arizona BBQ restaurant on local tv. We weren't expecting a lot from a cute new place, but were we surprised!  The pulled pork was fabulous.  It was moist and was full of flavor. (Don't pay any attention to the feeble whining of the snowflakes. ). My husband loved the Superstition Combo, especially the brisket and the muffin. I loved the salad, but I forgot to ask for their ranch dressing version.  I'll try it next week. When I go back. . If you are nice to the owner, he is gracious enough to even change his tv station, when it is quiet."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a great bbq place in the Gilbert area and had just given up when we found this gem! Their brisket is so tender, it just falls apart. My husband got the superstition platter so we got to sample several meats, the ribs and pulled pork were good as well. I had the pulled pork loaded baked potato, which I would say was an 7.5/10. I was a little weary about the sauces because I'm not into spicy or Mexican flavors, so I didn't care for those as much and when I tried their tangy and sweet bbq sauce on it's own before the food came out I surely thought I wouldn't like it with the food, but surprisingly the bbq sauce on the food makes it fantastic. It just pairs so well together! The roasted corn was amazing, will be going back just for this alone! The potatoes wedges hot and fresh were amazing as well. So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Went in with my wife on a Wed. night and there were 5 other tables seated although I wouldn't say it was busy.  We decided we wanted to try a little bit of everything so we split the $20 combo and got a couple cups of the brisket chili just to make sure we had enough.  The combo was huge and actually would have fed both of us.  I would say the pulled pork and the brisket were top notch while the ribs were some of the best I've ever had.  Pink and tender and juicy with plenty of smoke flavor just falling off the bone.  The sauce selection was interesting and I tried 4 of them, liking the habanero the best.  I need to try more of the sides.  The potato salad was a little too al dente and bland considering it was \"chipotle potato salad\" but the wedges were hot and well seasoned.  I'll definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Just tried the Pig Mac sandwich.  WOW!  After eating half the sandwich (portions are large), I was completely stuffed yet I was craving more at the same time.  

I sampled the sauces while waiting for my order.  They were all very good and offered something for everyone from mild and tangy to spicy/hot.  They even have a green chile sauce.

My challenge will be to try other menu items because the second I walk into the place that Pig Mac will be calling my name.  This place is the real deal and we will be back regularly."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had, get it Arizona style. The chipotle potato salad and Mac and cheese was great as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered the 1/2 lb pulled pork on a brioche bun. We enjoyed being able to mix up our own sauce by combining different one available from the sauce bar.  The food came quickly, the pulled pork was tender, the sides were delicious (potato wedges seasoned perfectly and mac n' cheese with a kick). I also appreciated a gentlemen checking in on us during our meal and ensuring the food was to our liking!"}
{"text":"Really solid BBQ place out in the southeast valley.  Definitely worth stopping in to check out.  The ambiance is very characteristic to AZ and the staff is very friendly.

The food has a distinct southwest flair that you won't normally find at your average BBQ place.  I also hear the meatloaf is something you can't miss but I haven't actually had it so far.  I will next time.

I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Overall pretty delicious.. ribs and brisket were on point and the muffin bread was delicious"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and stopped to eat here. It wasn't very crowded while we were there which was actually nice. Excellent customer service. Super friendly! Love the hallway of crosses!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy hot and fresh bbq. Great for the whole family. Been here twice and each time the staff was friendly and gave good recommendations."}
{"text":"My husband loves his bbq and swears by this place. Big portions and a variety of different sauces make it great for everyone."}
{"text":"First time in and won't be the last. Great local barbecue shop. Lots of good food, meaning large portions . Good friendly service. The place smells amazing!!! Good selection of sauces"}
{"text":"Tried Arizona BBQ for the first time tonight because our girls school did a fundraiser there. Husband and I got the tacos.  Pulled pork and brisket and they were both delicious. Our girls both got the pulled pork sandwich and loved them. We also tried the Mac n cheese, corn bread and corn as the sides and they were all really good! Great variety of sauces...my favs were the sweet and tangy and green Chile.  We will be back to try the meat platters and burritos!"}
{"text":"My husband, mother and I all ordered a bowl of the brisket chili with a cornbread muffin. We all 3 scraped the bowls clean and polished off the muffin. Some of the best chili I've had. It had big chunks of brisket in it and amazing flavor. SO good! We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"We've driven by their signs on Ray road more times than I can count. Tonight, we decided to stop in for a quick supper. We were greeted by friendly employees who were happy to help and answer our questions. I ordered a bowl of their brisket chili, my husband ordered a brisket sandwich and a corn muffin. My husband is not easily impressed and thinks everything is just \"meh\", but he LOVED his supper, and stated, \"Dude, this is my spot. I need to eat this every day!\" Ha! Our food was amazing, great portions, great prices, and great staff. It doesn't get any better than that, and we'll DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"Oh my God, Arizona BBQ Company's food was AMAZING. I got to attend a sneak peek event where their chef, Mark, introduced Gilbert to his fantastic skills and wow! First, they roast all their meats dry and then let you add the sauce of your choice, as much or as little as you like. This is great for someone like me, who actually prefers the dry rub flavors to really saucy barbecue. So, I had the pulled pork and the brisket. The pulled pork was super flavorful, and the brisket was the perfect combination of lean and fatty and just melted in my mouth. I cannot wait to go back. My husband and daughter both had ribs and pulled pork. My TX-raised hubby raved about both, and especially the chipotle barbecue sauce, which he said was the perfect level of spicy sweet - neither flavor overpowering the other. This is definitely our new go-to place for barbecue."}
{"text":"Great bbq.  Potatoes wedges crispy even when covered with their brisket Chile.  Brisket was tender and flavorful.   Ribs fell of the bone and again a lot of flavor.  Meats served dry but the sauce table has great sauces.   Bad part is that they are only 8 miles from our house (hahaha).
Love it."}
{"text":"I've been to alot of bbq's and I'm not easily impressed. This place is the real deal. The meats are very good and the sides. Had the brisket, pulled pork and the ribs.The meat was tender. The sides were very good too. I had the mac n cheese and the potato wedges. Also had half my friends corn roll. I liked the sauces. I tried 3. The mustard, the sweet and the green chili which is so good on the tortillo with pork. Will be back soon. It's hidden behind the tire store so don't miss it."}
{"text":"The ribs were really good and I like their BBQ sauce. I also had a nice salad. I really wish it was table-side ordering, and eating on paper can be challenging, but no complaints with the food at all. Oh.. good cornbread! That's always a bonus!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome BBQ great brisket and ribs. The roasted corn was amazing. Prices were reasonable and the food was fast out of the kitchen. Cold Beer and nice staff"}
{"text":"Really good food. I had a pulled pork sandwich with the green chili Mac. Pork was tender, moist, and flavorful. Mac and cheese was good. I tried a handful of sauces, although I wasn't crazy about any of them. I plan to go back soon."}
{"text":"Unfortunately didn't even get a chance to try the food. Went to get take out on a Friday night and they were closed at 8... like what??? The gal who was cleaning the floors said they \"just close when they run out of food\" Ummmm okay."}
{"text":"This place though! I've been here twice in 4 days. The Chiccaron's  alone are worth the trip. The dining room has the fantastic scent of BBQ. I had the Camelback Combo last time. 1/4 lb each of beef brisket, pulled pork and Chicken with two sides, Chiccarons and Southwestern Slaw. Tonight's choice, loaded Chiccaron's. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good food! The pulled pork sandwich had plenty of meat on a fresh roll. I went there for lunch and it's and order at the counter and they brought our food out to the table. There are a few beer choices too. I will  be back again. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq, best brisket sandwich Ive ever had. Bacon, chili, mac and cheese was delicious too. Cant wait to try more. Puts Porkopolis to shame!"}
{"text":"I love BBQ and this place does it properly. The food is excellent, the servings ample and the prices make eating there a solid value. All of the sauces are served on the side and kept warm--a nice touch compared to squeeze bottles of sauces on the table. If you like BBQ and are in the East Valley, check it out."}
{"text":"The place is legit.  The brisket is some of the best I have had - no joke.  Pulled pork and smoked chicken were fantastic too.  X factor!? The roasted corn - WOW!  Get it.  My wife got the tacos and Mac and cheese.  Only feedback would be for tacos:  double up on corn tortillas - they both broke on first bite, but not a deal breaker.  We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this sweet spot because of a flat tire I was having repaired at discount tire. I'm glad I decided to go for a walk and came across this restaurant. The food was pretty good but the staff was even better!! I loved the warmth, the attention, and the care I got while I enjoyed my food. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"We absolute love this place!  Its so delicious 
And the portions are great.  They serve a pork chili that my 7 year old and I couldn't get enough of! Great service also.  We will return."}
{"text":"OK...let's start with the basics, not the best location as it is tucked away behind a Circle K and a Sherwin Williams paint store and in a little strip mall.  If it wasn't  for the little sandwich board that i see when i drive by, would have  never of known it was even there.  That is the only bad thing about this place!  Finally stopped in for a to go order and amazingly friendly and helpfull staff from the cashier that helped me with the order to the kitchen staff that...since it was a to go order...had some questions for me about how i wanted some items...Incredible chicken, when I got it home went to grab the chicken to move it to a plate and the bone came right off in my hand...the chicken was amazing.  I tried two sauces the sweet & tangy and the habanero and bothe were really good.  The S&T wasnt overly sweet and the Habanero had a kick but wasn't over powering.

Can not wait to go back and try the ribs.

If you have a chance to stop in please do so you will not be disappointed.. this place is legit BBQ"}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING food!  The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the ribs.  Everything else I've tried from the brisket to the chicken to the corn and then potato wedges are all amazing quality and have great flavor!  The staff is really friendly too and if you check in you get an order of their homemade chicharrons for free and they are sooooo delicious!  Do yourself a favor and eat here!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite BBQ joint in town! The rib meat falls off the bone, the brisket melts in your mouth and the pulled pork is packed with flavor, normally I slather bbq sauce all over but their was no need for much due the meats being cooked to perfection. I recommend the superstition platter, the green Chile bacon Mac and cheese and corn bread and Chicharrones. 6 Star if I could and highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever felt the need to write a review on a restaurant.  Because after reading so many great reviews on here I was really looking forward to trying it. It was so disappointing I have to seriously wonder if they pay their employees to write good reviews.   I stopped in on a Friday night for take out. It wasn't busy at all - guess that should have been a clue. I ordered the Camelback Combo which comes with brisket, pulled pork , smoked chicken, tortillas (weird for a bbq place I thought) and 2 sides. For the sides I chose the mac n cheese and the potato wedges. Get home and open it up and...no Mac n cheese. Considering the meat was in a single container and the potato wedges were in their own separate container you would think it would be very easy to notice a missing side when bagging it up. I called and of course I was told I could come back to get it or pick it up another time. All of the meat and the potato wedges were just so average that even though this place is right down the street from me I won't be going back to pick up that Mac n cheese.  There are MUCH better bbq places in the area!"}
{"text":"We had heard good things so went in to pick up some brisket for dinner. Ended up with a combo plate of brisket pulled pork and ribs. The pulled pork was average, not dry but not much flavor either. The brisket was disgusting- probably 50% fat- yuck! And the ribs had a ton of fat too- we ended up throwing most of our $25 purchase out. The sauces were pretty good but if the meat is gross you've got nothing to put the sauce on ?

In response to the owner, I understand brisket can have fat but I've never had brisket with this much fat and look at the color- no color or smoke ring. Does that look appetizing to you? I have nothing against the customer service- I'm sure that the staff would have happily wanted to fix the issue but it was take out and I wasn't going to go back."}
{"text":"Listen, I love a good BBQ joint as much as the next guy, and I didn't know what to expect when this one opened up right down the road, but...WOW!  Brisket is my go-to and a pretty good indicator of how much the chef knows about BBQ, and this place kills it.  Tender, moist, smoky, and addictive.  Here's the thing, though: the pork is even better, and I never thought I'd say that!  Put some fresh pineapple on top and toss it in a corn tortilla and you've got one of the best BBQ street tacos I've ever had.  Period. This place is going to make waves, and you'd be a fool if you skipped it."}
{"text":"First time here and Yum!! We walked in and there was only a small line. It took us the 5 minute wait to decide what we wanted. They were friendly and ordering/paying was a breeze. We sat down and our drinks were brought to us about 5 minutes later then the food about 5 minutes after that. Everything was so delicious! The pulled pork was so tender. The sauce options are great. The green chile sauce was amazing. I highly recommend! 

PS... happy hour specials 3-7 even on weekends ;)"}
{"text":"First time here. Walking in it feels homey and spacious. I like how you can see your food getting prepared and there's a bar! We were greeted and given menus and told to sit anywhere. We ordered the Four Peaks platter and it came with 2 sides and we ordered an extra two.  The platter came with pulled pork, beef brisket, 1/3 rack of ribs, and bbq chicken.  We got beans, mac, corn bread and potato salad as sides.  The meat was so tender and delicious, the cornbread is some of the best I've ever had. And the other sides were tasty.  We tried all the sauces they offer warm, they were YUMMY. And we also got the AZ chop salad! All of that for $30 with a drink too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by here on a last minute impulse. We had intended on going somewhere else nearby but when we saw barbecue we decided we had to give it a try!

When you walk in the place feels nice and open. We were greeted immediately when we walked in and had the process explained to us. It is your typical order then sit down place. I saw some instances where someone delivered food to the customer and others where they called out an order number. I think it was just dependent on how busy they were at the moment. 

We ordered a sampler platter, a baked potato, and the sopapillas.  The platter had pork, brisket, and a 1/3 rack of ribs. The pork was perfect!!  Super flavorful and juicy. The ribs were very tender and came right off the bone but the flavor was not my favorite. Same with the brisket. Very very tender but definitely needed some sauce added on. For sides we got a corn bread muffin and the jalapeño Mac and cheese.  The muffin was good but nothing noteworthy. The Mac and cheese was awesome!  A little bit spicy but a really good blend of southwest style and traditional BBQ Mac and cheese. We loved it. The sopapillas came after we finished the rest of our food and they were a perfect finish!  Overall the meal was about $30. 

Overall it was a good experience and we will very likely be back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The meat was cooked perfectly. The service was exceptional. The different sauce options just left you going back to try another."}
{"text":"Great bbq but only reason I didn't give it a five star is their need for better sauces"}
{"text":"First time here...a bit too pricey when one wants ribs for lunch. Smallest portion with a drink was $17+. 
The place was very hard to find. The front has no signs on the outside only barely visible store front signage. We almost didn't stop. (And I'd be ok with that)
The ambiance is boring, though the kid who greeted us was very polite and cordial.
As for the food...
I've had better ribs. Especially considering the price. The cornbread muffin was good. Nothing that made me say \"OMG THIS CORNBREAD MUFFIN!!\" But it was good. The potato wedges were over cooked and they don't have ranch. 
Am employee asked how the food was and I was honest. I told him the wedges were over cooked. He threw out an excuse and walked away with his feelings hurt. I'm very sorry sir. I really didn't mean to hurt your feelings...I was just being honest.
When we were done they had a very clearly marked clean up station for where to put the silverware, cups trays and what-nots...but for $17+ for lunch? I don't wanna clean up after myself. (Of course I did though!)
I had to ask for a wet nap. First rule of barbecue is WETNAPS. 
Also, the place was dead with only one person besides us.
Not the worst place I've ever experienced, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went there about a month ago and surprisingly it wasn't busy at all. The BBQ pulled pork was amazing and the sides were delicious too. The location isn't the greatest as it's in a strip mall behind other businesses so it is easy to drive right past it.  Hopefully others will discover this gem and give it a try. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This is now the 4th restaurant concept at this location that I've visited in the last decade.  From Chinese to really bad fast food to Italian and now BBQ.  Food wise, I believe this is the best.

Decor is a bit scarce but that's ok.  It's clean.

They must have really good filters in this place as you don't get much, if any, smell of BBQ.  Piping a little into the dining area would help with the experience.

The order was for the Ribs, Briskets and Pulled Pork with a variety of sides.  I would average out to almost 4 stars on taste and smoke.  Great start.  For reference, I would give Famous Dave's about 1 to 2 stars at best.

The variety of sauces were great but the presentation at the self-serve sauce table was a bit boring.

For what you get, in quality and portions, I believe the prices are very fair and a good value.

This new restaurant will definitely be part of my rotation."}
{"text":"So good!!!! It was our first time here tonight. We loved everything about this place. We walked in late and they were about to close but we were greeted by the hostess/cashier that was extremely helpful and friendly. She said we could stay and eat, we didn't have to take it to go if we didn't want to. So that was nice! She knew the menu well and was super patient and answered all of our questions. She was very sweet and helpful. The owner was very friendly as well. He came out and talked to us. The chef/cook brought our food out to us. He was also very nice! The food was so good! Everything we had was very tasty and so good. We will definitely be going back there!!!! Oh and the decor was so awesome- we loved the look of the place!!!"}
{"text":"Oh My Goodness, with the emphasis on GOOD!! Everybody NEEDS to try this new outstanding BBQ restaurant!! Here's a sample of what's available. That's a HALF POUND of brisket!! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"We went in on a week night with 10 people. We all ate for a great price. Food was fast and SO good. BBQ sauces are great and they serve on the side which is nice. Everyone in our group raved about how great it was. Go try this locally owned place! It's delicious and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Hidden away in a strip mall behind Discount Tires is this great BBQ place.  I saw the a frame out on the corner and decided to make my way over there and check it out.  My boyfriend had the combo smoked chicken and pork sandwich with green chili mac and cheese on the side. Lots of meat! He use the habanero sauce. I had the 1/2 chicken with chili lime corn on the cob and ranch beans.  The portions were so generous. The prices were totally fair. 10.50 for his and 11 for mine. We could barely eat it all. I'm in love with the corn and could see myself coming back and leaving with a few for later. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Well, well, well... what a wonderful little gem we stumbled upon here! We figured we were in for a treat with such wonderful Yelp reviews going for them and indeed...my fellow Yelpers got it right! First of all, the restaurant itself is clean, comfortable, and nicely set up. There aren't tables packed in so tightly that you feel obligated to introduce yourself to the person at the next table because you are sharing elbow space. Secondly, we found the staff to be quite friendly. As first-timers we had some questions and each was answered patiently and a few suggestions offered. Now the food...the food...okay! It's why we were there right? And let me tell you it did not disappoint! YUMMMM-MMMEEEEEE! I wasn't a fan of the cole slaw but the very nice gentleman who took my oder told me that it had a lime something something to it, so I'm not holding them accountable for my 'let's try it anyway' approach to what I knew likely wasn't for me. Otherwise, there wasn't a single thing that was placed on the table that my family didn't adore. We enjoyed the atmosphere, the food, and the service. Thumbs up all the way around!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, the meats were good and the price was on point. Not busy but really clean and their sauces were hot and tasty. The sides were not bad. I am really picky when it comes to slaws and this one was great in the tacos, I only gave it a 4 because the tortillas were dry and cold, so I ate the taco insides and left the tortillas and it was really good like that."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. I had the tacos and my husband had a brisket sandwich. Both were tasty!!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We went an hour before they closed but they were very helpful with the menu since we have never been in before. Everything was fresh and it was fast coming out. It is a wonderful place and the pulled pork was tender and so full of flavor! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow. As a midwestern transplant, BBQ is taken very seriously in our house. These guys have it figured out. Delicious, smokey brisket and pork that melt in your mouth and ribs dry rubbed and cooked to perfection. The portions are extremely generous making the price spot on. The potato salad was nothing to write home about but the cornbread and mac and cheese are great!"}
{"text":"The absolutely best BBQ outside of my Kamado Joe! Great brisket, great choice of sauces!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little hidden BBQ place. Located in what I would consider a strip mall, I was hesitant but they had good reviews so I though we'd give it ago. 
Turns out to be decent BBQ! The prices are average with other BBQ restaurants and food tastes good. Meat is tender and falls apart. I really liked the 6 different sauce options, there were self serve. 
I will definitely return for a quick BBQ lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place was bomb and lived up to its already set Yelp expectations (and stars.) the location is set back and kind of hidden, I thought, but great food awaited inside. 

Pickup a menu when you walk in the door and after that head down to the, hopefully, short line to the register. For this meal, we got  the combo sandwich and combo burrito. After you order they'll call you up to grab your food from a pickup window.  

I had the combo burrito and the meat in it was delicious! The bean salad (?) inside was good as well but overall, I wasn't really feeling the burrito style BBQ. It jut didn't work for me and I LOVE almost anything burrito. I just felt it concealed the amazing BBQ inside it. We also had a combo sandwich and, well, AMAZING!! You literally can't beat an old fashioned pulled pork sandwich. The sauce was also extremely delicious. They even had a \"sauce bar\" where you could select some warmed sauce sides to supplement your BBQ. We had a side of Mac n cheese and it was alright, but we felt it lacked overall boldness. 

They do have a small bar here in the corner with a fine variety of drinks to choose from. 

Overall, the BBQ here was DELICIOUS and a must try if you're down for som good ol BBQ. I'd skimp away from the burrito and go for the originals where you'll get plenty of meat to douse with their delicious sauces. Try a side, why not! Looking forward to coming here again and probably will try a platter or sandwich!"}
{"text":"The food was great the service was outstanding I love this place if you want some great BBQ at a great price Please come here.."}
{"text":"This was our first time dinning here and I think this place is a hidden gem!!!!  The chicken was amazing I also really like the pulled pork. My hubby had the tacos and said they were the best he has had. My farther in law had the ribs and was very pleased!   We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"We were going to head to a taco place, but it was so packed, that we tried Arizona barbecue.

First, the pluses:

Nice sitdown place, very comfortable. Very simple.

Decent but simple menu items.

I had two tacos, one a pulled pork and the other chicken both smoked meat. Meet was good, moist. Toppings were good. The tacos were about 4.50 each, but loaded. Overall very tasty. I thought the meet could've had a little more salt, maybe a bit more smoke flavor. The wife had a chicken leg, the kids both had burritos with smoked chicken. Everything was very tasty decent quality.

They also have a small bar.

Negatives:

Maybe the word negative isn't right, overall we had a good experience. But the mac & cheese I wasn't that impressed with. It seemed like canned cheese sauce. Maybe it wasn't but it tasted that way. The pasta was a little dry on the edges.

The mear was overall good. Moist. But just lacks some smoke flavor that I was hoping for.  For lack of a better word, a little bland.

Overall, I would return,  average barbecue."}
{"text":"My wife and I are BBQ lovers. This place is the real deal! We had the Camelback combo, pulled pork, brisket, and chicken. It came with two sides, tortillas, and a roasted jalapeño. The pulled pork was moist and flavorful without a lot of fat, the brisket was also flavorful with a beautiful smoke ring, the chicken was on the bone but we were able to eat it with a fork because it was fall off the bone. Professional Bbqer's will tell you that means it is over done, it was not. It to was moist and full of the Smokey mesquite wood taste. They use a real smoker that is vented outside. If you want Championship BBQ this has to be your next stop! And don't forget to try the side sauces, I liked the green chili, it went perfectly with the pulled pork!"}
{"text":"A great new bbq place in the east valley. We had pork ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Meat is served naked with a wide choice of sauces at a separate station. I enjoyed the habanero and spicy Colorado. Meat was very tender, but lacking \"smoke\". The group also enjoyed green chili mac, corn bread and tacos. Warm chicharrones were fantastic! Had a wonderful house margarita as well. Excellent hh prices and great customer service"}
{"text":"I was going out with my boyfriend and our best friends for dinner and drinks and it was my turn to pick the place.

The pressure!  Do I pick and old standby, tried and true?  
Or gamble it and go with a new place that we haven't deemed worthy yet, risking their polite scorn??  I decided to gamble it.  

I found this new little BBQ place on Yelp; practically still in it's infancy.  I announced my edict to them; we would be dining here.  To be honest I was a little anxious bringing my gang to an unvetted restaurant, but I didn't let them know it...never let them see you sweat.  (Because it's gross.)

Holy smokes, if these guys didn't make me the hero of the hour!!    Not only was our food stellar (we had the Superstition Combo), but the beer selection was good, my margarita was rock solid, the service was friendly and efficient, and the whole tab was less than what we'd play at the 'other place'.  You know...our FORMER favorite place to get drinks and dinner.

Oh, and there was a Yelp check-in offer for free chicharrones, and I'll tell you those were the best chicharrones I've ever had made fresh.  They were still popping when we got them and lightly dusted with chili powder and lime...amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot here in Gilbert for some tasty BBQ. Been here 3 times and have never been disappointed. Tender juicy brisket, great pulled pork and the sides are money too. I highly recommend the Chile lime grilled corn, loaded baked potato and green chili Mac and cheese. It may be tucked away behind Discount Tire and Circle K, but do yourself a favor and check this place out! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So good we've been twice in one week! The variety of bbq is good and you get to choose your own sauce! If recommend for dine in or pick up."}
{"text":"Best bbq I've had in Gilbert so far! Brisket and ribs are delicious. Pulled pork and chicken were good too don't get me wrong but I'm partial to a nice moist brisket and dry rubbed ribs... they knocked it outta the park. They have several sauces to choose from and all are very tasty. Sides, can't forget the sides, whoever came up with the green chili and bacon Mac and cheese is employee of the month, cornbread was amazing, chili lime corn is bomb as well. Way to go guys keep it up I've already let a few friends know and we will definitely be back as well!"}
{"text":"Great place for bbq'd meats. I had a combo of pulled pork, brisket, and pork ribs, and two side dishes. Prices were reasonable for what I got. I'd recommend this place to anyone that craves BBQ."}
{"text":"Just had the taco combo and it was really good. The cornbread is very good as well. The mac and cheese was kind of lacking. Could be a little more creamier. I will for sure keep coming back here. It is tucked behind two other buildings tho. Not bad, I reccomend ."}
{"text":"Definitely not up to par! The brisket was pure fat, the coleslaw was horrible. The only redeeming thing was the cornbread but it was cold!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic BBQ with great service.  Casual enough to go to alone for lunch, filling enough to be a dinner spot.  They have fountain drinks, beer, and two kinds of sweet tea.  You get your food quickly after ordering.

Highly suggested: potato wedges or loaded potato wedges!

We were nearby and found the place by smell.  A group of us split: half rack of ribs, four peaks combo, loaded potato wedges, and our sides were slaw, mac and cheese, potato wedges, and corn.  It was enough food to overfill five fat people.  Any meal is two meals.

The potato wedges were perfect.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, not greasy, not salty.  The loaded wedges were tough to describe without swearing.  I feel that ordering fries at a BBQ place is stupid because it's a waste of some nice, rich soul food type sides you rarely get to eat.  Not here.  Get some steak fries onto your table here.  Trust me.

All the meat was fantastic.  I've had too many good ribs to say these were for sure the best I've ever had, but not so with the brisket.  The brisket was the best I've ever had, easily.  The meat didn't exactly fall off the bone, but came off the bone easily, so again, perfect.

The mac and cheese was the best I've had in a restaurant as the shell pasta was firm, the cheese thick, and the green chili and bacon added great flavor and texture.  Best ever goes to my Mom though, sorry.

Pulled pork was how pulled pork is 98% of the time, heavenly.

For the sauces: habanero was 10/10, mustard 9.5/10, green chili was 9/10.  You mouth may vary.  Some of the best sauces I've ever had to go on the best meat I've ever had.

The menu is simple, and there are chicken/pork/brisket salads and sub $10 meals that would be perfect for lunch.  I really wish this place was close to my work!

If I owned it, I'd put up a chain or half wall to corral people to the ordering register to avoid some confusion.

Try this place."}
{"text":"I had carry out ribs with green chili mac n-cheese and coleslaw. The order took only 5 or 6 minutes to put together and was complete. The ribs were as good as any I have ever eaten. The were moist and tender. The sides were also good. The sauces were a surprise as most places have 1 or 2 this place had 6. I really like the habanero, green chili, and mustard. The restaurant is a cafeteria style place not fancy. They have a small bar in one corner that at this time is not functional because of licensing issues. Management says this is being taken care of. Some of the online menu items were not available at the restaurant. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband is from TX, so it's been hard to dazzle him with local BBQ options. AZ BBQ Company is hands down our favorite BBQ joint (above Joe's BBQ, Dickey's etc). Their food is so flavorful! The owners are always there and super friendly! They treat us like family. We are slowly but surely becoming WEEKLY regulars! It's a nice place to relax as it can sometimes take a little while to get your food...but man, when it comes - it's totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. I got the ribs, pulled pork, and brisket with potatoes and the Mack cheese. The pulled pork and ribs were really good! Loved the potatoes and the Mac n cheese is a must to order! Not a fan of the brisket as it was wayyy too fatty for me. They have a sauce bar the sauces were hot temp. I liked the chipotle and mustard the best. Very good!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best barbecue place in the valley!  The potato wedges are perfectly seasoned and  the pulled pork is so tender it melts in your mouth!!!  Portions are generous and the Arizona sunset is refreshing and oh so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at this establishment Saturday evening. The staff was very nice the food was so so. Not the BBQ place, that I would go back too."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place!  The meat is tender, juicy, and flavorful.  The kids love the Mac and cheese and potato wedges."}
{"text":"Best bbq in the east valley!!  Hate to say it but it beats out Joes by far.  Also very reasonable prices and you get a ton of food.  They have lots of great specials every night of the week, like free drinks with your meal, happy hour, etc.  They even have public safety and military discounts, which is nice to see a business support the community in that way.  Family/locally owned business and you'll more than likely see the owner when you're there.  I have each of the 4 times I've been since they opened.  Oh, and is most forgot, extremely cheap local craft beer, and even cheaper on happy hour!  You really can't beat this place!  Love the bbq sauce bar too!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. This place has it going on. They are Arizona bbq that does naked meat and has a good selection of sauce. The meat is super tender, not greasy, and full of flavor. Brisket is lean and falls apart in your mouth. Pulled pork is off the charts. The corn bread muffin is massive and all meals come with a grilled jalapeño. There is a lot of love put into this place and it's definitely worth a visit, and don't forget to try the habanero sauce."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant. We need some really good BBQ in Gilbert. +++For Customer service. They were very friendly. 

I placed an order to go and I got the Superstition Combo with The Green Chile Mac and Cheese and the Southwestern Coleslaw. The brisket was really good. It was moist and had good flavor. The pulled pork was just okay but lacked smoke flavor. The ribs I didn't care for probably because of the rub they use. The Mac and Cheese was average but the coleslaw was inedible. It looked dry and it was. There was a faint vinegar taste but I think maybe they forgot to dress all of it. 

They have 5 sauces. I chose the Sweet and Tangy was a little vinegary for my taste but it got to the job done. I ate most of the brisket without sauce anyway. The other sauces, Chipotle, Habanero, Mustard, and Green Chile, really didn't appeal to me so I didn't try them. 

So kudos for the customer service and the brisket. The sides need some work. As I do with most newer places, I'll try them again in a month or two."}
{"text":"I love the pulled pork here. It's got great flavor and isn't fatty ever!  The green chili, bacon Mac and cheese is delicious and keeps me coming back for more. The chefs really pay attention to detail with the homemade food entrees. The atmosphere is very basic and we enjoy taking our food to go. The closing hours during week days are early (8pm) so that's something to keep in mind. Friendly staff and management."}
{"text":"Favorite bbq spot for sure. The chili brisket is the best chili I've ever had. The brisket is some of the best brisket I've ever had too. Will def come here again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and the first time was amazing, which brought me back. The second time my ribs and brisket were covered in fat =\ the ribs were not edible at all, but the pork was very good. Their Mac and cheese was great, and so was the customer service!"}
{"text":"In this area within 5 minutes of my house we can probably choose from 50+ places to eat. We decided to try Arizona BBQ Company tonite. Great choice! My wife had BBQ chopped chicken salad. She said it was great & fresh, the corn muffin was large & fresh. I had Platter #2. The pork was tender, the chicken cooked perfectly, and the brisket was one of the best I've ever had. I had the sweet/tangy BBQ sauce & it too was one of the best I've had. I also had the bacon mac & cheese & it was good too. We will definitely be back. With Dave's and Waldo's nearby this is by far the better choice. It is off the street & hidden in a small strip center but the food is worth it. I think some lighted signage is probably in order to draw some attention, but having only been open a short time it may be coming. Great place!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE AND ATTENTION TO WHAT THE CUSTOMER WANTS!  This place got my food fast, great sauce bar, meat was the most tender I have ever had, salad was excellent!!  Will definitely be coming back here!  Best BBQ in Arizona for sure."}
{"text":"I had the Superstition combo. Ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Was good. Served naked. The meat not the waitress. Arizona flair with a roasted jalapeno and tortilla. Washed down with a Prescott Brewing Achocalypse. Basic western decor. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick lunch recently at this hidden gem (it's located in a strip mall behind a Discount Tire and Circle K).  We like to support local businesses and I'm glad we gave them a try. The owner and staff were very friendly and accommodating. But to the food: This is real deal BBQ. My husband ordered ribs which were very tender and juicy...fell off the bone, in fact. I had the chicken tacos - so good!  The chicken was also tender, not dry at all.  We enjoyed the variety of BBQ sauces too...you can pick your own (traditional, spicy, sweet) from containers that are set out on a counter space which makes it easy and accessible for refills.  It's very clean and modern inside with a cool AZ vibe, and has a small bar with two TV's...we notice these things lol.  Great iced tea too!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I am a fresh food, no additives, clean food person so if you like BBQ this is for you.  Love the flavors!  The smoked meats are outrageous in full flavor and moist."}
{"text":"I love BBQ and everyone else should too if you plan on going to heaven since that's all we'll be eating there!  Really good smoked meats, but what's really great is the AZ twist on their food with some heat and fun twists like BBQ tacos (get them!). Reasonable prices for all their meals. I go every 2-4 weeks"}
{"text":"Really really good BBQ. Got the Superstition Combo, ribs, pulled pork and brisket all of which were excellent! The corn on the cob was surprisingly crisp and the Mac and cheese was also solid. Will definitely be using their LUNCH IT & PUNCH IT CARD."}
{"text":"I have been to every BBQ joint in Gilbert and this is the best, especially when you factor in price. I am so glad this place opened with a great variety of sauces (all of which are amazing). The meat of course is great but the sides are also impressive and the roasted poblano is a nice touch. The consistency of the pulled pork is great with a sweet smokey flavor and the spare ribs are done perfectly! Definitely get the mac and cheese as a side!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow! This is what's BBQ is supposed to taste like! The brisket sandwich piles the brisket tall. Never dry or too fatty; just right. The chipotle potato salad is a hit along with the hand cut fries. The AZ Sunset is a tasty twist on a tequila sunrise that still has a kick while tasting like an alcohol free refreshing beverage.  Fast, friendly service and great pricing. We'll be back!"}
