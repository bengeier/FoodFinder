{"text":"REALLY WANT TO LIKE YOU SAUCY. 
You are getting 1 star though. Only for the beer. 
Living in Hingetown I was super excited to find out we were getting a Brewery that also crafted pizza!  I keep trying to give Saucy chances and they keep failing me. July 5 opening day we went in and my first impression was WOW! I liked the look and feel of the space. I sampled all the beers on tap. Really like the IPA and the Hefe. Got the Bees Knees pizza and was very impressed. At this point I was thinking YES, this is going to be my go to spot. Second and third times in this place got a bit peculiar. 

A day later rolled in here after work. It was packed and the ordering areas were chaos. People seemed to be confused on the beer and pizza ordering lines. The bartenders had trouble pouring beers. There was no seating anywhere. You would think for such a big space they would have better usage of it. Upstairs is nice and open but there is only a few seating options. This puzzles me? Saucy has beer and pizza. These two things require inviting comfortable seating areas. I can tell they tried at this but failed miserably. This is not a place for locals. It's a place for the masses. They want to herd you in like cattle. Get in line. Order beer. Drink beer in a corner while waiting for the pizza you ordered in a separate line. Then shove pizza in your mouth as quick as you can because there is nowhere to sit and enjoy it. 

Worst part of all is consistency. I've ordered the same pizza 3 times. Always turns out different.  One time my 12 inch pizza was only 9 inches. How does that even happen? One night after work I went in just for beers. I really do like the beers here. The \"core\" beers weren't even all available. The ASAP IPA and B. F. Hefe weren't on draft!!! Another day I placed a pizza order and got a text it was ready. Went to the counter and long and behold no pizza. They said the order was entered wrong and I will be getting a second text when the pizza is ready. This process took roughly 45 minutes entirely. 

Overall Saucy is not very welcoming and there pizza blows. Hingetown is a small Pocket of Ohio City that tends to feel more like a community. Saucy has a West 6th / Townhall vibe that doesn't quite fit in our neighborhood. I will be across the street at Jukebox like always wondering what could have been."}
{"text":"First time here during lunch.  Cool atmosphere with music.  Beers are solid in a variety of styles.  Had the Bees Knees pizza...  superb!  Bottom was crusty while toppings were just right.  Pizza had some heat to it...  enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is not New Haven Style pizza! I just ate at Saucy Brew Works for the first time and left disappointed. The atmosphere is great, the beer is just okay, but the pizza was very weak. I had been excited to try this pie for weeks, ever since a co-worker mentioned that a brewery had opened and was claiming to make pizza like that of my home town in CT. Just know, from a true local of New Haven, Saucy Brew hasn't even come close. I don't know where the owners did their research when opening this brewery but it wasn't New Haven."}
{"text":"Ordering food and beers takes forever. There is one giant line to wait in (one computer to process) while your party waits at a table. Does not make sense. If you'd want two beers I'd order the first time around or cross the street!  Outside of that, food and beer quality was good. In between trivia questions you might hear them call that your food order is ready (?).  Bizarre approach to the service industry."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait if you are going to order a beer here, even if its not busy. I waited 25 mins to not even get served at the bar. Was told that you had to leave your seat to stand in line at the side of the bar to order a drink. So be prepared to come back after waiting to order to lose your seats. Not a very good run bar. We ended up leaving after not getting served to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A fun place. I liked the pizza, and the beer was good. I really prefer something watery and American (i.e., Bud Light), and they set me up with something similar. In the spirit of adventure and open-mindedness (and because I was staying nearby and walking), I also tried a flight of six of their beers. They weren't all to my taste (one tasted like a votive candle to me, but I think we've already established my level of beer sophistication), but it was fun to try their different kinds and flavors. Friendly staff. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Great beer, pizza and their salads are amazing.  Our favorite pizza is the bees knees which has spicy capicola and honeycomb which is so tasty!  The porky pizza is loaded and will fill you up.  Favorite beers are their citrusy IPA, Belgian, and their Hefe is  one of the best I have had in Cleveland.  They have a great layout and is the perfect patio hang out."}
{"text":"Good Joint.  I like the beer.  Obviously some growing pains but a nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"This is a great new place with an open layout and lots of tv's. They brew their own beer here so it's fresh. The hefe was awesome. The pizza is good however the crust is very thin. Good place for families too."}
{"text":"It's different from many other restaurants and I think that's where all the negative reviews are coming from. This particular pizza has a really great flavor, the representation is phenomenal. I did feel weird going to the counter and grabbing it myself but again it's a different type of place. The set up is pretty classy, can't wait to be kid free so that I can try the beer and sit by their fireplace."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, and it is everything I wanted it to be and more!
Most importantly, the pizza and salads are amazing. They brew a variety of great beers, my favorites were the Fauxbia White Stout and Habituale Kolsch. 
It was a nice afternoon when we went yesterday so they had all the roll up/garage door style windows open for an indoor/outdoor feel. 
I can't wait to get back to this place, there is an awesome food scene in OHC but a place like this was definitely missing."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious.  Tried the Bees Knees, Cleveland and Quattro Formaggi.  The sweet and savory red sauce of the Bees Knees was so good.  I'm not a big pizza eater but this was overall pretty awesome pizza according to my taste.  Thin crust but not TOO thin.  Cooked to perfection.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Saucy Brew Works looks great and you can tell there was a lot of attention paid to layout, furnishings, etc. That said, Saucy follows the current trend template of opening restaurant spaces that are incredibly loud and noisy (with decibel levels hovering close to 90). The place was pretty packed for 7:30 pm on a Sunday night, however the line at the bar moved very quickly and Saucy's beers are really good! 
The problem was waiting in line to order food. There was a line and only one worker taking orders and answering phone calls and taking orders over the phone. The ordering process seems duplicative - having to fill out a form with your order and then waiting at a cash register while your order is entered into a computer. The whole process to just order food took over ten-minutes (in between waiting for the worker to finish answering phone calls). The woman in front of me was getting so irritated that I noticed she didn't leave a tip. There is another register for ordering food, but not one worker came to the rescue to move the line and make the customer experience smoother and faster.  The pizzas were good however and I'll return to give them another chance to improve the customer experience. It's not always fair to review a place that just opened, as there are always improvements that should be made - but these reviews can be revised as they improve."}
{"text":"Not sure about this place but their beer isn't great and they charge $3 for a sticker. You might need to make a name for yourself before you charge that much for merch"}
{"text":"Here on a Wednesday at happy hour (4:30 arrival). Steady but not busy, got busier with time. I noted the beer line that many complained of, but it moved fairly quickly. The two bartenders moved quickly. So, they could've used an extra bartender, but the 'order station' wasn't the problem. Kinda nice really as it keeps people from hovering over your shoulder as you sit at the bar. And people are served in order as opposed to just 'closest to the bartender' or 'loudest.'  The beers were solid, I had a sampler tray (which isn't discounted for happy hour). They were out of a 'steam beer' when I was there, but that didn't interest me anyway. I came just after the Tribe's 21st win in a row game...so it was far from dead in here. No food for me, but the pizzas looked decent enough. So, yeah. Solid first impression. I'll be back in spite of others gripes."}
{"text":"I am not a huge pizza fan.  Traditional pizza w marinara and cheese is too heavy and boring for me.  I like exciting food.  As for my husband?  He'll eat anything tasty (\"boring\" pizza included - he is Italian, after all) and he LOVES beer.  So when we drove past Saucy Brew Works one night, we added it to our list of places to try.  They only really have pizza, but I decided that the menu looked exciting enough to give it a shot some time.

Fast forward a couple weeks to date night and we decided it was time!  We went on a Sunday around 8:30 (they're open til 10).  The ordering situation is kind of weird, but they have signs on the tables and at the doors that tell you what's up.  First, we placed our order at the kitchen (neon signs also light the way).  We each got a small pizza, which yields 4 slices and should be more than enough for any grown person.  He got a porky porker pizza and I got a kung pao shrimp pizza.  Then, we turned to the bar to order our drinks.  This place is a brewery, so we both ordered beers and were not disappointed!  We found a seat (wherever you like!) on the patio and our pizza came out within 10-15 minutes!  I guess that they normally text  you (your order slip asks for your cell #), but they weren't busy so a server brought our pizza out to us.

The pizza was delicious!  They are thin-crusted (my favorite) and you can tell they are made fresh because the crust was irregularly shaped and bubbled (plus I saw them rolling the dough out in the kitchen :) )  I don't eat meat, so I didn't try my husband's.  It was loaded with meat and he really enjoyed it.  My kung pao shrimp pizza was INCREDIBLE.  I LOVE spicy food and have a pretty good tolerance, so don't take it for granted when I tell you that the sauce is SPICY.  I had to stop after 2 slices for a cool down, but it was so good that I went back for a third slice before reluctantly packing up my 4th slice for a spicy midnight snack.

Anyway, the concept is new, the menu is pretty diverse/yummy, and the beer is served cold and quick.  I highly recommend to anyone who loves a fun twist on traditional pizza and a cold beer to accompany!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place.  Great decor, TVs everywhere to watch the game, delicious pizza (like everyone else, The Bees Knees is my favorite, but the Poutine is also excellent, and the two go together well as a sort of main course/side combination), and, perhaps most importantly, delicious beer!  They're always debuting new flavors, and each is consistently inventive and excellent.  Their range of beers seems quite broad for a brewpub: while they have all the IPAs for you squares, there's seemingly always a Belgian or two for we of more refined palates, and many styles in between. I can't wait to see what they brew up for the holidays!"}
{"text":"The Kolsch was right up my alley.  Absolutely no wait time to get beers.  The pizza concept really 'worked' for this place.  Very large, open, airy.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you want to stand in line. Be treated slightly rudely and sit on picnic tables with dirty menus and paper towels. This place is for you! This place is work! For you! You have a very long line for beer and the pizza can get very expensive if you order too many toppings. 
Might try again in the fall when the dust settles. They need to try to hire some staff that actually want to work! Like work behind the bar and pour beer in a fast pace!"}
{"text":"Both beer and pizza were just ok.  We had the mushroom pizza and there was way too much goat cheese on it, and it lacked depth of flavor.  Same thing for the beer--it was ok but all 4 we tried lacked depth and substance."}
{"text":"What a cool vibe, good food and an interesting space!

Wife and I made our way here recently, after \"earning\" two free (small) pies from a Cleveland Monsters hockey promotion.  The menu is limited to pizzas, salads and a few sandwiches...but don't let that deter you.  If you want a chill place to hang while eating some good grub then this might be the place for you!

We settled on two different pies, ordered a side salad to split and chose a paddle (muffin tin, actually) of six different beer flavors / styles to sample.  There was an empty sofa on the far side of the fireplace, so we settled down and waited for the food to show while we slow-sipped our chosen beers.

The sampler had a wonderful array of different and unique flavors of beer.  My wife loved the Fauxbia which was a white stout that was rich yet smooth.  She also really enjoyed their Nitro Sugar Cookie blonde oat ale...so much so she ordered a pint of it as well.  The most unique flavor had to be the Punchline.  I drank a swimming pool full of Hawaiian Punch (as a kid growing up in South Florida), and sure-as-shootin' this blend tasted just like the real thing!  So many beer flavors to try, so little time...

Then the food arrived!  The side salad was substantial and enough for two to share.  It came with a nice sherry-mustard vinaigrette (our choice), mixed greens and veggies we also chose.  The pies were prepared thin crust style and cooked to a beautiful char.  The pepperoni version had a thick red sauce and large slices of meat.  The crumbled duck confit was rich and paired well with the truffle parmesan cheese and garlic olive oil.

Two small pies and a salad were just the right amount of food for two.  We are soon going to be moving to the area...we will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"Porky Porker: a decent thin(ner) crust pizza with unique toppings! There was no line (probably because we came on a weeknight), and the wait wasn't too bad (ten-ish minutes; no wait staff or hosts, so you need to place your own order). The beer was also unexpected; you'll have to try it out! The atmosphere is pretty cool and airy, though the location is in a quieter part of town. The place also has a virtual jukebox for you to play music and a game area with skeeball. Overall, a neat place to hang with friends."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Extremely clean. Everyone is friendly and the food is very good. The beers are great and definitely different than typical bars. Worth a try, lots to do in the area. Parking in back as I found after looking on the street."}
{"text":"We checked out Saucy for the first time, and it has a great feel when you walk in.  Big fireplace burning real wood, tons of natural light, and cafeteria seating make it feel very comfy and casual.  You can do flights of beer up to 6 different beers!  We will be back to visit soon.  I would recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since it opened but it was always so packed so when I noticed the crowds dying down over the past few weeks, we decided to give it a try.  And now I'm sorry we did. It was just not great, and unfortunately not even ok.  The beer was maybe a step above mediocre home brew, likewise for the pizza. The ordering system is confusing for first-timers (it's all self service, you order food and beer from one too-small counter area) the bartenders are uncaring of your needs.  The space is cool and the furnishings are neat, someone spent a lot of money on this place but sadly I don't see their investment return any time soon."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, Beer, Pizza...all was fantastic.

This place s very spacious, plenty of TV's spread out on both floors.

They have a patio but no tables out there yet.I'm sure they are coming soon.

They really sunk a lot of money in this place and it shows.

Cleveland's 6th Brewery in Ohio City. Even though this is brand new, it is easily one of my new favorites!

I only wish they had a better system down on ordering beer other than waiting in a line everytime you want a beer."}
{"text":"I'd give them a 3.5. This is another newer brewery in Cleveland. It's location is pretty easy to access off Detroit Rd, but it is a little bit of a walk from the other breweries and popular areas of W 25th. The food and drinks are all ordered at the bar, and you seat yourself at all the tables. The pizza is fine, but nothing outstanding. The beer is pretty solid.
The pizza I'd give a 3/5. The pizza gets cooked pretty quick, but can get a little burnt. On the menu they say that this is normal, but I'm personally not a huge fan of it. The pizza is a thinner crust which again is just not my preferred pizza style. They offer a wide variety of options, some of which are very unique. We have had Chick'N Waffles, Poutine, and Cleveland. My favorite has been the Cleveland, which has kielbasa, peppers, and onions, which we usually order without the mushrooms. The Chick'N Waffles was delicious, but be warned it can get a bit spicy as it's topped with sriracha. The poutine pizza was very unique with confit duck and cheese curds, bt also quite tasty.
The beer here is good, but I would like seeing them have a few more experimental beers on tap. I'd give the beer a 4/5. For a smallish, newer microbrewery, I have always expected a few more options and varieties. I've enjoyed most of the beers I've had. The BF Hefe is one of their standard year-round beers, but to my is typical of American \"hefeweizens\" which aren't really up to snuff when compared to a true German Hefeweizen. My favorite beer here is the Fauxbia, which is a white stout. Don't let the appearance fool you, as it looks like an ale, but tastes like a stout.
All in all we like it here, come back occasionally, but being a little out of the way, and without a ton of limited realease and experimental brews to draw us back, not a frequently visited brewery."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time as it's a short walk from my apt. The area is nice and is definitely worth exploring if you're not from the area. In terms of this place in particular I was not impressed. I imagine it's due to growing pains.

The bar setup is nice as you just order everything food/drinks there and then get the food from a window when they call your name and the drinks as they're poured at the bar. Took a bit to get a drink on a week night when it wasn't super crowded. The beer pours were by far some of the worst I've seen/tasted recently. The first round each drink was half foam!! Full price for each beer ($5). The taste of the IPA and white stout were less than great, to the point where I didn't want to finish the IPA.

As a side note the parking will be getting limited here soon as I heard the lot next to it will be going away. For now there is plenty of parking (90% is street parking, non-metered).

In terms of the 3 stars: 1 for the atmosphere and setup as it's a beautiful brewery, 1 for the patio/seat yourself availability/they actually had serve yourself water that was cold, and finally 1 for the stout, as much as I didn't like the other two I tried, the stout was a good pour and tasted really good.

I think the beer will get better with time and I assume the pizza is good for how expensive it is."}
{"text":"The beer line is incredibly long, but the pizza is wonderful! Try the Bees Knees one for sure."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good pizza! I came with a group and we all shared so I got to try a bunch of different. The Cleveland & Funghi were my favorites. The pizza is very thin so not too filling which is nice when you are drinking heavy beers. The ambiance is cool but I didn't like the \"seat your self\" seating. We went when it was relatively busy with a group of 6 people so it was like a strategic game when we initially got there to try and find somewhere to sit. It made it a bit stressful and we actually almost left but then a table miraculously opened right as we were leaving. They also don't have servers so you have to go up to a register and wait in a line to order food. But what was more inconvenient was you also had to wait in a specific line to get a drink at the bar. Overall the food and drinks were great but since they don't have a hostess or servers your experience can be stressful and make it seem like a chore to get a table, food, and drink..."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday afternoon, and it wasn't busy. The food and beer must both be ordered at separate counters.  They will text you when the food is ready. I had the Bees Knees (Capicola and honey) pizza, which was good.  My wife had the little neck clam pizza which was a bit overdone for my taste.  There are a few other things on the menu besides their \"apizza\" and I would try something else next time.  I had the Fauxbia white stout, which I thought was very good. This was my first exposure to a white stout."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. I want to so hard. The food and beers are AMAZING, and the interior design makes for cool ambiance. HOWEVER!!! The lack of table service is a SERIOUS problem. Having to stand in line, NINE people deep, with two bartenders taking food and flight orders is absolutely unacceptable. Then I have to cart things back to my table myself (a minor inconvenience, but still annoying), only to sit there alternating between resenting the line I just stood in, and dreading getting back in it. This ultimately prevents me from getting a second drink, because by the time I'm done with the awesome pizza THAT I FETCHED FOR MYSELF, the line is now TWELVE people deep. So, no. That's not a thing. My initial $45 tab for two pizzas, a flight, and a beer could have easily turned into a $200 tab if I wouldn't have to wait a friggin' eternity for EACH drink/dessert thereafter. I'm quite certain I'm not alone in this as I overheard other patrons having similar discussions while we were all turning to dust in line. The money you saved on wait staff is nothing compared to the money you lost to your demoralizing line. 

This frustration is exponentially grown by your policy that each person must be PRESENT with their ID to order a drink!!! Can I bring up three valid IDs and get three drinks? No?! Too much common sense?! Seriously, WTF?! Now my WHOLE table has to do the death march to the counter, ultimately growing the line, crowding the bar and creating more transactions, rather than you sending a damn server to our table, checking all IDs, and just serving us like civilized human beings! 

In sum, you have a great product, please make it more accessible. If every customer has to run a gauntlet for ONE drink, you're ruining what could otherwise be a lovely experience for your customers, and a profitable evening for your business. Fin."}
{"text":"Great pizza and beer.  Large beer menu with great variety.  Pizzas were excellent.  Lil neck clam pizza was amazing.  Vey accommodating with substitutions.  Awesome addition to this great neighborhood."}
{"text":"What a cool place! After months of driving by, my boyfriend and I decided to finally stop in.

They have a private parking lot around back, a great amount of seating, plenty of pizza options (their speciality) and a nice, laid back environment. 

We had the Margherita and Kung Pao Chicken pizzas. We liked both a lot! The pizzas have a very thin crust, but definitely one of the best I have had in the area. To wash it down, we had the punchline, a regular fruit ale, and a cherry (stout?) to drink. Both very good!"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch with some coworkers. We ordered pizza and beers. We had an IPA, Stout, and the Coconut IPA. We all loved them! We also ordered pizzas which were fast and delicious! When I picked up my pizza, I thought they had gotten the order wrong. Turns out, I ordered the wrong pizza.... However, they were so sweet about the whole thing and just made me what I had originally wanted. Everyone was so kind and friendly! The atmosphere was great. (Not too loud, which is a huge problem with restaurants and breweries these days.) We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.  If I could give them 2 1/2 stars I would.  The first time I came here was on a double date with friends and it was great.  The hostess explained that you order beer from the bar and food from the kitchen.  Weird but ok?

The guys went to the bar to order us a round of drinks and it took them 25 minutes, which kinda sucks because we wanted to all sit and visit with each other.  My friend and I couldn't leave our table to go wait with them or else we would have lost our table because it was busy :/ I had the beer flight which was good and I liked the presentation as it was served in a muffin pan.  Cute idea.  After our first round we all wanted more beer, but no one wanted to wait in line by themselves because that's no fun!  Instead we decided to order some pizzas before we left which were amazing!  We had the bees knees and the frittata pizza.  Pricy, but it was so good it was worth the cost!  Pepperoni and honey might be my new favorite pizza topping!  Overall great food, but they needed to fix the beer situation.  Since we went here right when it opened we wanted to come back and give them a second chance.

Came back again with another couple, but this time it was worse!  They had the same crappy beer situation where you had to go wait in line and lose your table.  I was really hoping they would hire servers after seeing all the Yelp complaints, but no.  We decided to order some pizzas because they were so good last time, and wow what a let down!  What happened?!  The food was soooo good my first time here, but this time it was awful!  I actually felt bad bringing people here because the experience was that bad.  No one liked the food or having to wait in line for beer.  I was actually embarrassed that I brought people here because it was that disappointing.  We were planning on staying all night and drinking, but we ended up leaving and going to another bar in Ohio City.

Unless they hire some servers and have more consistency with their food, sadly I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Decent enough space, although the location is kind of odd. Had two beers and a small pizza and it cost me over $20. I wouldn't complain about the price, but the beers were average and the pizza was probably below average, especially for the price. May return to see if they work out the kinks, but not in a hurry."}
{"text":"I visited this weekend. The space is beautiful. I really can't believe this was the same building. The location is great, parking actually wasn't that bad.


We got the bees knees and The Porky. Sooo good. I really loved the bees knees easily my top three favorite pizzas of all time. Service is kinda eh, they had paper towels, but no plates. And no one offered any I just took like 10 paper towels and set my pizza on that. 


I would've rated it higher but the service was just so so and the ordering system is...unusual to say the least. Very inconvenient.

I wanted to get something to go before we left so I filled out my card and stood in line. Theres about 4 ppl behind the counter working. Nobody acknowledges me. About five mins of standing there a woman comes over and says oh I should have put up a sign, we aren't taking orders anymore you have to stand in the bar line. The bar line is long so that's another 10min of waiting. I just ripped up my order and left. They couldn't have told me as soon as I got into the line the first time? No servers if you're at a table and want a drink you have to stand in line."}
{"text":"Oh Saucy I wanted to like this place so badly but it fell just a little short to me. On a negative note, the beer was kinda flat and not all that great. My friend ordered one of the Nitro brews and his glass was 50% beer 50% foam and he paid full price for it. We decided we needed to try the pizza because it is after all a pizza and beer place. Ironically, the best part of the pizza was the sauce living up to its name. Unfortunately everything else about the pizza was forgettable. 

On a more positive note, it is a really cool place. The fireplace, multiple levels, and large windows make it a good place to hang out or take a date."}
{"text":"#NikoAtheneos *Really* has his thoughts and style Nailed Down here! Every detail of the brews, pizzas (sauces, seasonings, cheeses, freshest ingredients) and hand-picked employees are beautifully handled by Him as they all go through their first week of opening jitters.  Seems like a few of the obviously-not-customers (investors who are sure they know better than everyone) need to back the hell off and let this great concept/location/chef/team succeed instead of getting jerked around. As a patron, I would love to be a regular here... We'll see how it all shakes out."}
{"text":"Packed on opening day. The floor plan is awesome and open to hosting big groups with large doors that open. They have a good variety of pizza and beers available.

It's a self serve model we're seeing pop up more and more in breweries now. The beers had a good flavor and there was a good selection-six on draft. For an opening day they did a good job managing the crowds and the managers were friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome...beer is NOT!!  Tried a flight and every one I tried was awful!  Please get a new brewmaster!"}
{"text":"I was so so excited about this place, but was utterly disappointed when the first words out of the dismal bartenders mouth were \"we're out of the IPA.\" 

Epic fail. 
And the service was awful. Customers waiting at the bar were dropping like flies.

I tried another beer and left. If you only have ~10 beers available, there's no excuse to not have backup. It's too bad, the menu looked delicious."}
{"text":"The good:  building is very nice and spacious.  Patio is nice as well looking right out to the center of Hingetown.   Beers are pretty good.   Some unique beer glasses as well.  

The bad: Couldn't order a pizza at the bar, had to order at the kitchen.   Minor inconvenience, but then I was supposed to receive a text when the pizza was ready which didn't happen until after I left.   The New Haven clam pizza for $23 was not a good pizza in any way.   Was a wafer thin crispy crust with no chew.   Just tasted like a salty cracker with some clams thrown on it.  I'm all for thin crust, but not this New Haven style.   It's too thin and the red pizzas have too much sauce for this thin crust as well."}
{"text":"Saucy Brew Works is a spacious, modern brewery in the revitalized eastern corner of Hingetown.  It is an expansive, obviously expensive to build location that fits well in the context of the neighborhood.  There is an upstairs space that is cozy and provides a good view of the floor space. Outside is a small patio for al fresco dining. Like many new breweries, it is very industrial looking, but not not offensively so. There are two stations to order- one for beers or food (primarily pizza). Service was friendly and reasonably fast. Based on the size of the brewing area, I assume they plan to bottle/can and distribute their brews. Their marketing is clever, but in the congested local craft brew market, I am not sure the beer quality will stand out from the crowd. 

Their short beer list includes a nice variety of styles, but nothing stood out from the 6 samples we tried. The kolsch and IPA were the best of the selections but honestly not something I'd go out of my way to have again. The pizza looked okay, but at around $18 each (for a specialty large pies) seemed pricey. In fairness, I did not try one, but they should be amazing at that price and I sensed that was not the case. Also, I found it odd for cooking so many pizzas, there was no fresh baked pizza smell in the air. 

I can see stopping in again if I was in the neighborhood, but I am not sure it would be my first choice considering the options in the general area."}
{"text":"Lots of tasty vegan and vegetarian options here. The Lorain Avenue pizza was delicious and filled with cheese and arugula. The staff was friendly but didn't know the menu that well. Plus the soda is unlimited!"}
{"text":"Nope.  Overpriced and the food is terrible.  Ordered an Italian Sandwich and a Caesar salad.  Day old Romaine with taste less dressing and and anchovie on top.  Sandwich was a couple of slices of salami on an a piece of burnt pizza dough.  Didn't even get my order right with no tomatoes requested.  And had violent diarrhea afterwards.  Disgusting.  This place is a cancer on what used to be a cool neighborhood.  Avoud."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza and brew. I don't get the negative reviews. The pizza is fresh. Tasty. Frankly it's succulent. And the beer selection is top notch.  The scene is cool. Nice little outdoor space. Modern. Just a fun cool place. Go enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place was really good. I was pretty close to this place and said screw it \"I'm gonna try this.\" Service, atmosphere, and food were all great! I would definitely recommend people to try this place."}
{"text":"We went here 1/23 because we were redeeming our Cleveland Monsters hockey tickets for FREE small pizza.  We didn't try any of the Micro Brew beers.  I was disappointed and not aware that there were not any Servers.  There are Order forms and pencils on the picnic bench style tables.  The Order Forms do not have Prices of the menu items.  You have to look for a Table-Tent Menu for ingredients and prices.  It was kind of interesting to pick out the pizza sauces, meat toppings, cheeses, vegetables.  My small pizza was missing half of its toppings because of the Air-bubbles in the pizza dough. When my Name was called to pick-up my small pizza I had noticed this. I said something to the Bearded Counter guy, he was RUDE and didn't offer to make me a New pizza or take my pizza, add toppings.  The cooks do not wear hair nets and hats. The bearded guy wasn't wearing a beard net. I'm glad our pizzas were Free."}
{"text":"This is a ridiculous place, and it pains me to say that because it could be such a great addition to the Hingetown neighborhood. First off, it is a BREWERY that CLOSES AT MIDNIGHT, EVEN ON WEEKENDS! When I was there, people were coming in at 11:55 and being told they would really have to hurry things along because last call had already been made. Needless to say, they were quite surprised. Is this any way to run an alcohol establishment in a city like Cleveland? When I asked the bartender (who couldn't pour a decent beer to save her life) why, she gave me a rehearsed answer about how they opened for lunch so they had to close early! When I spoke to another bartender, he said they were trying to avoid late night riff-raff. A manager who tried to engage me in conversation as I was leaving gave the same rehearsed answer as the first bartender. As far as the beer goes, well, they only had half the beers that were on the menu. The IPA was very good, but stay away from the White stout unless you really like chocolate beer -- it is like drinking a Hershey bar. Overall, I would say this is a not so great place with rude help, not so great beer, and a bizarre approach to doing business in Ohio City. No brewery that sits in a prominent, well-lit space on a busy street in a happening neighborhood should be turning customers away at midnight. It makes me crazy to see something with such great potential and drawing power execute such a bad business plan."}
{"text":"Stopped in over the weekend.  Was a smaller space than I expected but well done inside.  Great tables, ambiance, beer board, etc... 

As for the beer, I tried 4 of their beers and didn't really like any of them.  They kind of fell flat for me.  Pizzas were good but way too pricey for what you get.  

Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! You ever read a beer that claims to have this flavor or that flavor.. and yet you don't taste anything... not here! I've never had such flavorful beer in my life... and it's awesome. The descriptions of the beers are so spot on. They have this amazing coconut IPA (which I've not found anywhere near my hometown) an awesome fruit punch tasting beer (punchline I believe it's called) you HAVE to try this!! I'd say get yourself a flight so you can try all these delicious creations! The pizza is delicious as well. Ive been in town 3 nights and have been 2 out of the 3 nights. If you like great beer and pizza.. go here! Bartenders were both attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I coincidentally tried their pizza for he first time with someone from New Haven who was pro in New Haven style pizza. We both agreed that this was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Get the Bees Knees pizza and thank me later. Spicy capicola and honey comb with red sauce on a thin crust... I mean, come on!  It's a savory-sweet bomb in your mouth that I'm still daydreaming about weeks later.  The beer was good too. I tried the Habituale which is a crisp Kolsch style ale that paired nicely with the 'za.  My only gripe is I think there could be more seating upstairs.  Call me boujee but I like to sit down when I eat. I will definitely be back here to try another one of their creative pizza offerings and beer."}
{"text":"Had a less than good experience here. You should not have wait in line for 35 minutes to get a beer! The one bartender was working her butt off while the one guy simply took orders and payment. There are no servers there. Systems need to be revamped if they expect to last the first year. There's too much competition for a place not to have operations running smoothly. Menu is basically pizza. Boring. Won't go back. There's nothing to bring me in again."}
{"text":"Cool brewery in Ohio City. I had my high school reunion there and they had a nice little loft area for private parties. They were even able to setup a bar upstairs in the loft, so you didn't have to constantly go downstairs to the main bar. I didn't have any food, but the drink selection and prices were good, as well as the service. Overall, I'd recommend stopping by for a drink, or even a private party (no idea how much that costs though)."}
{"text":"Great: the beer, the design.  The Kolsch is spot on and one of the best I've had.  The Bad: no server and very sub-par pizza.  Having to repeatedly get up from the table to order drinks or food.  Servers exist in almost every decent restaurant for a reason.  I'm willing to pay for that service so that there is not a constant up and down.  The pizza is not good at all.  Since that and salads is the whole food menu, they seriously have to improve to be considered.  There is great pizza all around them."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but the service was terrible, the wait for a beer on a Tuesday evening was more than 10 minutes. And honestly, completely inefficient, with everyone in the entire restaurant having to line up in a single line on the side of the bar to get a drink. There are no waiters for the tables which makes everyone have to go to the bar for drinks. I honestly not sure how this place will stay open unless they can figure out how to more efficiently serve beverages."}
{"text":"It really pains me to dole out just an OK to Saucy Brew Works, but our experience was exactly that. It was about as middle-of-the-road as you can get in just about every aspect. First, allow me to explain what you're getting here. It's essentially a brewery that also makes pizza. Yeah, they've got a couple of other menu items like meatballs and a few salads, but at its core it's a pizza joint. 

The space itself is pretty nice. It's got lots of natural light, nice high ceilings, an open kitchen and a goodly amount of seating for such a small area. There's even an upper mezzanine that overlooks the main dining/bar area that seems nice and cozy. You'll also get some TVs hanging down and a pretty, damn cool backlit beer menu that I haven't seen the likes of anywhere else. They've also got a rockin' patio if the outside things is for you. And another thing, it's really loud when the place fills up. I'm talkin' \"you'll need a lozenge afterward\" loud. Sort of like an echo chamber thing going on.

Here's something else you need to know. There's no table service here. Order at the bar for beer at the food station for grub. Fill out a form with the deets, give them your cell number and they'll text you when it's ready. Just make sure your phone's not turned over and/or muted like ours was. We were about ready to complain about how long our food was taking before we figured out it was our fault. Just sayin'.

The beer. Well, it's good, not mindblowing or hardcore beer geek material, just well-brewed, mostly common beer styles. They've got a decent selection of what I'd consider \"staple\" styles, you know the ones, the beer styles that basically everyone knows and that every brewpub on the planet seems to have - something \"light\", i this case kolsch, an IPA, a hefeweizen, and a stout, usually on nitro. This isn't a complaint just an observation. The main problem I had during our visit was that they were out of two of their 5 core beers, one of them being their IPA, and one limited release. C'mon, man. Anyway, kudos to them for branching out a bit with their Belgian-style strong ale and steam beer, styles you don't see all that often. Beer prices are on par with the area, $6 a pint, with a flight costing you about $2 a sample.

The food was, again, OK. We had the Funghi saucy pizza, the buffalo burrata and the chopped salad. The biggest disappointment for me was the pizza. For a $22 pie it just sorta fell flat for me. The sauce was on the dried out side of things and relatively underseasoned and the crust reminded me of a dried-out pita, kinda chewy and flavorless. Admittedly, I'm more of a bakery-style crust guy (think Jet's 4-corner) so there's that, but it's not that I don't appreciate a thinner, crispier crust once and awhile. Just didn't do it for me. Wanna build your own pizza? That gets pricey real quick. A medium starts at $11 and toppings are $2 each.

The salad was pretty good, nice and fresh with plenty of crispy pig bits, funky gorgonzola and egg, both a nice touch. The burrata came with a little arugula salad and a pretty, braided breadstick. The cheese didn't really have any flavor, and the breadstick was a tad stale. I know, right? Of course we ate all of it, but it's definitely not something we'd ever get again.

So, there you have it. Another, trendy little spot in another trendy little Cleveland neighborhood that's brewing beer. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good, they're just facing some stiff competition in and around the city. So, head here if it's convenient and you want some tasty, fresh-brewed beer. I wouldn't go out of my way to get their pizza, but if you need something to fill your belly whilst you imbibe, it'll do the trick."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Saucy Brew Works, it was time for me to visit! Saucy Brew Works is located in the newly developed part of Cleveland called Hinge Town. 

Upon walking into the establishment, it was neat to see the modern and industrial style of the place. It is a very causal place, where food and drinks are ordered at the bar, and once your food is ready, your name will be called overhead. 

I ordered a pint of the Punchline and a small Egg Sausage & Gravy pizza. My beer smelled just like punch and it was a unique drink. So many cool beer options to choose from. Never did I think gravy on a pizza would be good, but it was exceptionally tasty! I forgot to mention that this thin crusted pizza was the perfect crunch and chewiness. A medium pizza probably would have been better, but it was a good pre-dinner snack. I can't wait to come back and try all their other drinks and pizzas."}
{"text":"I wanted to wait a while before posting a review of Saucy. A few friends and I came here on opening weekend and it wasn't a very memorable trip. Not being one that gives up on places that easily, I returned a few weeks later and had a complete 180 experience. The staff is friendly and the pizzas are incredible! With the exception of the first trip, every experience here has been memorable. My favorite pizza is anything Napoli style! Delicious ingredients and very well made."}
{"text":"Great craft beers.  Good selection and good brews.  Pecan ale was very good.  Did not try the food.  Stopped on a Saturday evening and it was slightly busy but we were able to get a table for our party of 5 quickly.  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Service was great!  Even though it was crowded we were able to converse and the noise level was low.  Great brewery!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, the margarita my favorite, nice spicy sauce and great crust. The beer I had was a light beer comparable to Corona, very cold and good. Very clean looking place."}
{"text":"Really cool place to get some pizza and beer. It's open seating, so you might have to awkwardly wait around for a table to open. You order the pizza at the counter, separate from the bar. They say that they will text you when your pizza is ready, but (at least when we went) they were just calling names over the microphone. It was pretty annoying to keep having to hear an announcement every couple of minutes. They also didn't have a beer list at the table, they have the names above the bar, but they were hard to see and didn't have descriptions.

Overall, I really liked their pizzas. They're thin crust, and we split 2 medium pizzas between 4 people, which was a good amount. I wasn't a big fan of the veggie pizza--the crust was like a cracker and a little flavor-less. But, I really liked the Cleveland pizza, and would love to go back and try the different types! They also had a great beer selection--not a huge selection, but the ones they had were really good. I got the Three Hos Christmas ale, which was good and spicy! Also tried the Hawaiian Punch beer, which smelled exactly like Hawaiian punch, and was nice and light. I would definitely go back here again, but I would avoid the peak hours since I don't want to spend all my time waiting in line to order pizza and then waiting in another line to get my beer."}
{"text":"This place is an AWESOME add to Cleveland/Ohio City. The pizza selections are ENDLESS, the place is beautiful, it's just what Cleveland needed. You have to come check this place out, it's a must! The bartenders are great, the cooks are great, the atmosphere is fun!"}
{"text":"So this is my first post ever on Yelp! We missed last call by five minutes and were told if I serve your group I'll have to to serve everyone. Everyone consisted of no one! Everyone had drinks and there wasn't anyone at the bar asking for a beer. I know last call is last call but it would have went a long way for new customers. 

I'm not sure what's up with new breweries but holy hell it extremely too bright in the place. Also same industrial feel every brewery has these days. Maybe they are just trying to stand out because they are new? I missed the homey feeling of Bells and other Michigan breweries. 

Saucy at least got me to post for the first time and I think that I'll continue. I will go back to try the beer and I'll do it before last call. Maybe I'll go during the day because they need to turn the lights down a bit. I promise Saucy to be fair and if all goes well my next rating will be a five and it will average to a four!"}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza and excellent brews!  The Dead Nuts is exceptional!!!!  Would eat here every week, if we lived closer."}
{"text":"Good addition to the neighborhood. Nice space. The group I was with all enjoyed the beer and pizza. Only thing that seemed to be an issue for us was the service. You can only order drinks at one spot at the bar and it backs up real quick. We had to wait a bit for drinks (Mid-day Saturday). Hoping this is resolved since it is only their first week! 

UPDATE: Been back at least 2 more times since opening. Mainly for trivia. Pizza quality has gone down with each visit and bar service continues to be mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Nice space, atmosphere is good, up beat. The beer is good, had the vanilla pumpkin porter, haters gonna grape  ( love this name) punchline and habituale. Food choice was the little neck pie. It was decent.  We would come back"}
{"text":"A cool concept, but has a LOT of work to do before it's enjoyable. The pizza was tasty but the cooks scream \"MORGAN, YOUR ORDER IS READY\" over the intercom every time someone's food order is completed. This got very annoying very fast even though there weren't too many people in the brewery at the time. They make you fill out an order form with your phone number so they should be able to text you when it's ready? They also wouldn't let us order a 1/2 and 1/2 pizza so we had to choose just 1 type. This was unfortunate because we would've liked to try some of their unique signature pizzas but instead we could only try one. Also their computer system was malfunctioning so every time we ordered a drink they'd make you go through the entire processes of \"opening a tab\".... again. What's the point in having an open tab if you have to keep getting your credit card out? Wouldn't recommend, at least not until they work out the kinks!"}
{"text":"This is a really fun place to grab some food & drinks, great atmosphere and friendly staff. I've eaten here a handful of times and feel like the pizza is so-so, it's a thinner style crust which isn't usually what I prefer so maybe that's part of it. The pizza feels a little over priced to me. The beer is good, and I've noticed a little more variety lately. It's a good spot, just not one I frequent more than every couple months or so."}
{"text":"After going here a couple of time I really don't think it's a 5 start pizza place.  I got the fungi pizza last night and wasn't good and the small pizza is $13.  They do have a good selection but the pizza isn't worth in my opinion.   

The saucy bread is good but not worth $7...I pretty sure it was less last time we went back in December."}
{"text":"Beer was very good and great selection. The pizza was good, and the atmosphere was great. The staff was friendly and Knowledgeable of the beer. Will be back"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Saturday around noon and loved it! My friend and I found spots at the bar where we enjoyed a relaxed atmosphere, tasty food and drink, and excellent service from bartender Megan!

They have a patio for the sunny Ohio days, inside felt pretty open with your choice of tables or bar seating, and if you wanted something a little cozier/away from the crowd there is a loft just up some stairs. You can pick songs from one of those jukebox things and/or watch some sports on their various televisions. You can even take a stroll all around the building and find some sweet street art (that truck is hauling a hop not an artichoke like I first thought FYI). They even have a cool mural of this wild beer king on the inside of their back garage door. 

For beer I sampled six of their offerings in a flight $9 and my favorite was Punchline (fruit ale). My friend preferred their Anchorman (hoppy steam beer). For food we split a small Poutine Pizza $13. Now this small is more like a medium with 8 slices and it definitely left us feeling stuffed. It was very tasty! I know they describe their pizzas as New Haven Style, no idea what that is, but to me the pizzas were thin and full of sauce and toppings. I hate those wood fired pizzas where the crust is burnt and it's dry with very little toppings so I thought Saucy Brew Works did a wonderful job! I can't wait to try more of their pizzas mmm. 

This place is one of those self-serve breweries, so if you want to order something you have to go the designated ordering stations (one for beer, one for food), wait in line, fill out a form, grab your plates and utensils, and wait until they text your phone saying your order is ready. Of course staff helps bus tables and refill your water if they have time, but service is really on you unless you sit at the bar. 

I have no issues with my first visit and plan to go back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I checked out Saucy Brew Works during lunch. I've been trying to get to these \"new\" Ohio City pizza spots. 

Overall it was a pleasant experience. I was there a bit after the lunch crowd and just sat at the bar, where you fill out a paper slip with your order (size, sauce, toppings). When trying a new pizza place, I generally just go plain cheese or pepperoni. I like to know where the place is starting from as a baseline before venturing into any \"specialty\" pies they may offer. 

In this case I ordered both, a medium cheese and a medium pepperoni (I could order a large half and half because their large oven was not available). 

I thought the pizza was good. A little reminiscent of a frozen pizza, but not in a bad way (if that makes sense, which I admit it really doesn't). I can't quite put my finger on it though. The crust was pretty good, and I liked the red sauce quite a bit too. Here again though, the sauce was sorta spaghetti sauce-ish and not so much pizza sauce-ish (at least that's what I thought). But in the end I thought it was pretty good, and if there were anything in particular that I liked about it, it was the sauce, even though I compared it to spaghetti sauce. 

I didn't have a chance to try any of their brew offerings, but it seems as thought they have a nice variety. I will definitely go back to try some of them and to try one of their specialty pies too. From what I understand, that's what this place is really more about; the specialties. 

For me, it's a great place to stop four lunch as it's close to my office, and the food and service was worth having again. I'll be back, and I'll let you know what I think about their other offerings."}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner on a Friday evening. I liked the communal seating, but the benches are a little tricky to get in and out of in a crowd! I tried the Habituale (a Kolsch) and the KristallWeiss (a German style Hefeweizen). I liked them both, give the edge to the hefe. My husband tried the Punchline (fruit ale) and the BF Hefe (Bavarian style Hefeweizen)... he preferred the Punchline, which was VERY fruit forward! 

We decided to each build our own pizza; I did red sauce, feta, banana peppers and red onion, hubby tried a Margherita. I really like the thin, charred crust! I thought the sauce was a bit to heavily applied, but otherwise the pizza was delish! Hubs finished his pizza with relish, so it must have been good! While we were eating, an employee came around offering samples of the Kung Pao pizza - really good and REALLY spicy!!!! I don't know if I could eat a whole Kung Pao, but it was very cool to sample other pizza!!!

I think we'll be back... next time I'm going to try a clam pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer, lousy service. Only two people were able to pour beer. So the line was ridiculously long. If you sit at a table you have to stand in a long line to get a beer. Pay a few waitresses!! In the long run you'll make more money!!  

Update: Pizza is phenomenal!! Atmosphere is great if you don't mind serving yourself!"}
{"text":"I hope i can upgrade the rating later, because i will definitely be back and hopefully the kinks will be worked out. Pizza was above average, but if you are going  to call yourself a brewery you must be able to serve beers like a brewery. Bar service was miserably slow, though the very limited beer offerings did include some winners."}
{"text":"Recently checked this new Brewery/Pizza place out. They have a great selection of beers. The IPA was my favorite. There a unique variety of pizza as well as build your own. Pizza was fantastic! The atmosphere is also very good as well! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday. I want to like this place, but they have a long way to go. 

They didn't have their IPA pouring, which was disappointing to say the least. I do appreciate that they have spiegelau glasses available for the IPA's which is nice to see.

The beers we did have were good. The staff when asked about beers were not very knowledgeable unfortunately.

The actual facility itself was immaculate. A lot of money was put into this place. It reminded me of a very high end well established brewery...not a brewery that is just starting out. Excited to see what they can produce in the future.

The pizza was a pathetic excuse for Neapolitan. Whoever runs that kitchen should re think the dough immediately! They are ruining the Neapolitan name. The outside should be crisp but the inside should be nice and doughy... this crust was a pita chip...crisp...

Excited to see where this place can go. 3 stars for now... hope to hit 4-5 with more time"}
{"text":"This is a place I look forward to coming back to. The staff was friendly and courteous. Karen was very helpful in guiding me on my pizza options. Karen is friendly and polite. The bartenders were friendly and very kind to allow me to taste the different beers until I selected one I liked.  I plan on coming back so and bringing people with me. I recommend eating the pizza and having a drink at saucy!"}
{"text":"Cool place , but there was only one line for drinks and it took along time to order.   The beer was decent but would have been better if I didn't have to wait over a half hour in line. The pizza is uneventful. Not sure if I would go back maybe if they got more beer selection and more registers for ordering."}
{"text":"I so wanted everything about this place to be good. I had their holiday beer and was not a fan of the taste but loved the name. When I finally made it for some mid day brews , I found my selections to be okay for the what the price was. I am a bit of a old school type of gal when it comes to visiting  at breweries. I like it when you purchase a flight, you get the flight for a set price and a set size of each sample. Unfortunately this is not what I got here.  Each sample was a different price - I should have just purchase a normal pint of beer and went one for one because I walked out with sampling 6 beers and paid a little over $20. I will give them a second chance because the pizza did smelled and looked amazing."}
{"text":"Yes. I agree the beer ordering line sucks but the $9 margarita pizza was really good and thenprice point was fantastic. The beer was pretty good as well. Nicely done all around. They just need to figure out the ordering line and wveeything will be awesome."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time in the Hingetown area and have been waiting patiently for Saucy to open. Finally had my chance to check it out (twice) this week!

PROS
-Beer here! With the brewery being on site, obviously you are going to be able to enjoy a few beers that are unique to them. I had the hefeweizen and was not disappointed
-Casual Ambiance. No need to get super fancy to enjoy this casual establishment. I actually headed over in my workout clothes and didn't feel too out of place. This is a good thing, considering their neighbors are a spin studio (Harness Cycle) and boxing studio (Title Boxing Club).
-Unique Pizza Options. The menu is made up of mostly pizza served New Haven style and there were some interesting combinations, including one that includes clams

CONS
-It's not called saucy for nothing! Personally, I am not a fan of a lot of sauce on my pizza, so this falls into the cons for me. But if you love sauce, consider this a pro! I am looking forward to trying a white/EVOO pizza next time...I have a feeling I am going to like it.
-Order Here line. As far as I could tell, there was no wait service. Instead, you go up to the bar to order drinks and go to a separate area to wait in line to order food. Not the worst thing in the world, but you might be standing in line for a bit depending on how busy they are.

BOTTOM LINE
-If it's a \"pizza and beer\" kinda night, you and the crew should check this place out!"}
{"text":"Saucy Brew Works is one of the newest wave of brew pubs to open in Cleveland.  Like others of it's generation the kitchen is limited to counter service and just pizza.  That said the Viggie Pizza we got was delicious.  It was a really good combination of flavors, from the shaved brussels sprouts to the walnut brittle.  A medium was fairly filling for two.  They have a nice beer selection instead of a wall of pale ales.  The Stout Drink You was a smooth, and flavorful with a hint of hops.  The Nitro Sugar Cookie blond ale smelled just like a sugar cookie and though sweet was still pleasant.  The winner of the beer flight was Haters Gonna Grape belgian strong.  On our visit they had it in regular and barrel aged.  The space is huge and open with big windows.  It was cold on our visit and the wood fireplace was so inviting.  The staff was delightful, and I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Wow this place is fantastic! They have good pizza and awesome beer! The beer flavors are very unique. I shared the medium size quattro fromaggi pizza with my sister and her boyfriend. The pizza tasted great and was the perfect size to split among 3 people. We got the pizza as more of a snack as it was about 3pm last Saturday when we went. The atmosphere of the place is awesome. Through windows you can see the brewery and they have a nice outdoor patio for the summer. The place is seat yourself and the seating encourages large groups of friends to sit together or, when crowded, sitting with strangers. I love this style of seating at breweries because one often leaves with new friends as a result. 

Now let's get to the important stuff-THE BEER. Omg I have never tried so many unique beers under one roof. Punchline, the sugar cookie nitro, and the coconut IPA were all amazing. Normally I dislike IPA's but this one wasn't too bitter and the coconut flavor was extravagant. All three beers were among the best beers I have ever consumed. I cannot wait to come back again!

PS they also have flights up to 6 beers and they have cans available for sale."}
{"text":"Amazing beer, amazing atmosphere, and great food! If you haven't been then you live a dull life and you still believe in unicorns? Do it!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Saucy and thought it was just okay. We ordered a flight, and found half of the beers to be wonderful and tasty and the other half to be average or plain bad. The Coconut IPA and the sour beer stood out as the very best. The albino stout and the wheat beer left a lot to be desired. There are so many other breweries in Cleveland with quality and consistent beers that I'm not sure another visit to Saucy is worth the risk. We also ordered the frittata pizza and, other than the overly well done crust, found it to be very tasty and enjoyed the unique flavor combination. That being said, I'm hard pressed to say that standing in line for a small 4 slice pizza is worth the $15 + tip. I would also have preferred table service so I could have actually enjoyed the company of the person I came with. I'm not sure yet if we will return."}
{"text":"Cannot speak to the food or beer because we did not have the opportunity to try any. Service is exceptionally bad which rates one star. We came here today and sat at the bar (where we did not have to stand in line per the freestyle seating concept) and waited for approximately 10 minutes. We were expressly told that we did not have to stand in the \"Order\" line if we sat at the bar---which is why we sat there. It's unclear whether that staff person knew what she was talking about because we never did get served even seated at the bar directly in front of the bartenders.  No one ever acknowledged us, said they would be right with us or served us. After ten minutes we walked out and went straight to Platform instead. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"I am the first to update my reviews, when things go right.  I returned for a second try.  So, so, so much better!  There are \"directions\" on how it works!  The pizza was hit, fresh and delicious.  And the beers were all tasty. (I had the 6 pack sampler). My favorite was Anchorman.  Good changes, I really like it now."}
{"text":"Came here on opening day! Beautiful venue and extremely spacious. Two unique points to highlight - 1) Aside from normal bar and table seating, there are two cool lounge spots with couches and comfy chairs (one downstairs, one upstairs) 2) They opened the windows by the entrance so it gives a patio feel even while seated inside.

Bartenders were very nice and attentive. I ordered a small Fritatta pizza ($14). The price was a little alarming for a small, but the serving size was huge and well worth it. Definitely 2 meals worth of food in a small. The flavors were awesome - avocado, bacon, egg, goat cheese, sriracha, maple syrup and sundried tomato all combined to make an epic breakfast style pizza. Sweet, salty, spicy - all facets of your taste buds will dance.

For beer, I got the ASAP IPA and the Fauxbia (white stout). The IPA was crisp and refreshing, not too hoppy. The fauxbia was my favorite though because it was very unique. It tasted like a creamy ale with the robustness of a stout. 

I wil definitely be back again. Beautiful venue, great service and food!"}
{"text":"This was so much better than I expected. Atmosphere is really cool and reminded me of a combination between Punch Bowl Social and Nano Brew, minus the games, add more TVs. Their draft selection was very good and their pizza was PHENOMENAL; way different than anything I've had before. 

I had their Drifter Sour beer on draft. Our group shared pizzas: We had the Cleveland pizza, which is kielbasa (on a pizza?!?), peppers, mushrooms, and a killer white barbecue sauce that I couldn't get enough of...and we also had the Bees Knees pizza, which had just the right amount of honey and was really good as well. I will definitely be going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly especially the kitchen. Fred and Jamica was very helpful with my pizza selection. Got the Porky Poker #Delicious and tried the meatball. (Might need 2 take a course on the menu and the options). Very pleasant environment and I will come back again for this delicious pizza."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good beer, good food, and a great atmosphere, this is the place. My friends and I were in the area, and wanted to try a local place. I am so glad we decided to go here. I tried the Bee's Knees pizza and had a few of the beers they had on selection. 

Not sure why people are reporting bad service. I got my food and drinks very quickly, and the people were very nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer after kombucha class. I got a sampler and every beer was delicious. Awesome display board so it's easy to tell what the beers were. Chris was the bartender he was awesome and helpful. My friend and I split a pizza, we didn't want to, but we're trying to not be so Fat. We split the Funghi and it was amazing! Like four kinds of cheese, mushrooms and a bit of bite to the sauce. So good, I wanted ten more. The rest of the setup seems like an interesting concept, it seemed like communal tables and when you wanted beer or food you walked up to the bar and to the order counter to pick up. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I use the Yelp search algorithm differently than most, I would assume.  If I search \"on point\" or \"space\", \"CLE\" or anything hashtagged I immediately pass those reviews and unfriend that turd A.S.A.P.  They probably know every word to every Kanye and Katie Perry song and need to be pile drived.  The originality of a Xerox machine.  Anywho, I came here for lunch and have had the beers canned from the store.  The fruit beer tastes like straight up Hawaiian Punch, and not in a good way.  Imagine Cisco but fermented in a bums shoe.  Even Buckfast goes down smoother ffs.  More places churning out ales all hopped up.  Learn to lagerrrrrrrrr.  Going the way of Platform.  Can the hell out of everything we make and see what sticks.  Looks desperate to me.  Pick some standards and build on that.  The pizza was good but with the huge ass tray and the dumb ordering caddie AND the samplers out in front of us we took up 4 spots at the bar.  Had it been busy?  Aw, hell naw.  Why cant servers just take orders from the consumer and enter it into a p.o.s?!  Whats with all the damn paper and putt-putt pencils every place now?  And who's to say Johnnie tighpants is even going to enter what I put down correctly anyway?  Barrio and Flappy Dog are prime examples.  Bars are revenue makers.  People taking up more real estate at your bar means less places for people to post up and spend money.  I like to leave the smallest drinking \"footprint\" as it were.  I'm sure the power-lunch douche type would think otherwise, but hey.  Also, charging 6.00+ for afternoon beers (when there are 6 people in the place) is crappy.  Trying to make up for the $8,000,000 renovation to hipsterize an old warehouse is not my problem.  Make good beer and it will happen.  Only saving grace is the daytime bartender girl knew who the hell Radio Birdman was.  That's and extra fiver from me anyday..."}
{"text":"Ordered take out while hanging out at my son's apartment in Ohio City, gave specific instructions to call as apartment was upstairs; to move along we then received a call from the restaurant saying driver had been here for 15 minutes we were not answering the door. Driver was at the wrong house, pizza was overpriced 80 bucks two large and two salads; not nearly what we expected for the money and customer service non existent. I will not return and I suggest no one else should.

{"text":"I went into this place with high expectations, and maybe that's why I just didn't feel it as much as I wanted to.

It's a new brewery, yes. I want to always support my local eateries and breweries, because it's a passion. I met a couple of my friends for beer and pizza. We didn't even end up ordering anything until 20 minutes into the visit because we had no idea we had to order and pay at 2 different areas. You went to the kitchen to order and pay for your food, while you went to the bar to order and pay or open a tab. So we all took turns going up, ordering our food and booze, before we ended up settling down again at our table.

The beer I ordered was actually good, and the bartender let me try 3 samples before I settled on one. I ended up ordering the B. F. Hefe, a lighter beer, and I recommend if you go.

I ordered a small \"Straight Up\" pizza because I wasn't feeling the prices. The pizza I ordered was decent, as I ate the whole thing. My friend ordered a funghi pizza and another friend ordered a gluten free crust pizza. The gluten free crust pizza was so hard my friend couldn't even chew it. It was a brick. 

The manager was very apologetic and even gave her a gift card to come back and try something else. This exemplified great customer service, and I'll go back specifically because the service showed they cared about their customers. 

Really cool interior. It's huge on the inside and the vibe is great. I'll go in again sometime to try for a better experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with my family, I saw the reviews and wanted to try it out. 

The beer was pretty good, had the punch line and the hefeweizen both were solid.

 The pizzas had plenty of options for toppings like, sauces and cheeses. New Haven style pizza is definitely different than anything else that you would find in the area, not better or worse, just different.

The only complaint is the lack of table service, I had to stand in line for beer then stand in line to put a pizza order in, then by the time I put the pizza order in it was time to stand in the beer line again, and my pizza was ready about 5 minutes before my 2nd beer was.

I would go back, but maybe on a less busy night"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now (both times for trivia - Cleveland Awesome Trivia is, well, awesome!) and have yet to be impressed.  The pizza has been very inconsistent and service is not the greatest.  I also got a salad last time and it was overdressed and salty.  Last night a friend got the poutine pizza and could only eat a bit of it since it was so salty, so they gave him a plain cheese and said they get complaints about the poutine one all the time.  I wonder why they would keep it on the menu.

Overall the space is nice and their beers (if they have them) are decent.  There is a lot of potential, but it seems as though no one is happy to be working there and there isn't pride in the product.  We will go back for trivia and just get beer."}
{"text":"Hire a busboy immediately!!!!!  They don't know how to clean tables. I ordered a flight and I really liked my beers. But I found a table outside with dirty plates and glasses. I moved them to the edge and they never got cleared from our table. Looked around and there was an entire long table full of dirty dishes for at least 30 minutes.  Only because a couple went to the bar to ask them to.  The table behind us was never cleared the entire time we were here as well. Hire some busboys immediately."}
{"text":"Torn between 3 and 4 on this one. Beers - 2 stars for me. They usually have about 10 on tap, but only about one or two we've tried have been better than average. The sour blonde is quite good, and one of the hefeweizens is pretty true to style, but all the others we've tried (6 or 7) have been just ok or worse. Last weekend we tried their version of a Christmas Ale, 'Three Hos' and.....oh no no no no thank you. It's one of those very overly spiced ones where it tastes nothing at all like beer anymore. If that's your thing, cool. But I personally think the licking-the-bottom-of-a-spice-drawer flavor is super nasty when applied to beer. If you do too, steer clear of this one. 

Aside from the so-so beers, I love the atmosphere of the place - spacious, inviting and very well done. They spent some serious coin getting this place up and running and it shows. Love the left-in-place industrial elements of the building which they've painted bright yellow for accent color. Since opening, they have hugely improved the throughput at the bar and food ordering which was SO SLOW when they first opened. Still not great when it's pretty busy but tolerable now.  

The star of the show here is the pizza. These are 5 star all the way. I like the Barrio-style order sheets you fill out and then drop off at the bar. We highly recommend the Frittata and the Bees Knees - both just-right spicy and so delicious. 

Even with the great pizza, had to bump down to 3 stars because, look - you have 'Brew Works' in your name. Your beers ought to be good. It just seems like they've spent a ton of money, time and effort getting the food and space perfect, but neglected to polish the main event - the beer. The pizza will keep us coming back and hopefully the beers improve over time.

Would definitely include on a day of brewery touring in CLE, but plan to make it your stop for lunch and maybe not to spend a lot of time drinking beers. If you do, I'd recommend a flight at first since the beers for us have been pretty iffy so far."}
{"text":"I came here because I tried the Habituale at The Q for a game and I really liked it. Then I heard they also had pizza so it was a given! 

I tried two different beers this visit. Haters Gone Gold and Fauxbia. Both excellent beers. They do growler fills and have carry out options. 
For pizza a friend and I shared the porky porker and the ham/bacon/cheddar. This place is a thin crust pizza lovers dream. The pizza is just smidge pricey but the high quality ingredients make up for that. Both pizzas were delicious, crispy, and full of flavor. 
The staff was very helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. They have community seating (which I like) and a simple patio. 
I'm kind of a germaphobe when it comes to bathrooms so I really appreciate that they have this foot pedal thing to open the door when you leave the bathroom but that's just me haha
My only complaint is it's kind of confusing. They have order sheets on the table but no one comes to take your order. We finally realized that you have to order everything at the bar and then they text you when your order is ready. It's fine but would have been nice to have like an \"order here\" sign at the ordering station at the bar. 
Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love it. They have a wide and varied selection of beer and many are good. One of the best weizens I have had. The pizza is terrific! The small is big enough for one person with a big appetite. I tried two of the house specialty pizzas and both were great! They also have some craft sodas and I love pop, so that scored huge points with me."}
{"text":"Come alone, bring a group, host an event...Saucy Brew can do it all at any time of day. This new Brewery has been open for about 9 months now and is doing all the right things. 

The beer is fantastic. It has a decent size menu for beers but they do them well and they have great names. The food menu is limited to pizza and salads but its a brewery so sit back and enjoy the beer. Their brunch menu looks amazing and offers more food options if your gonna be the person that complains about food at a brewery.

I think this is a great place for anything from pregaming to funday Sunday!"}
{"text":"I ordered the clam pizza which is a personal favorite and supposedly one of the specialties here. The clans were so full of sand that the pizza wasn't even edible. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"Love it here. Beers are AWESOME. I'm a huge dark beer dude and their porters and stouts beat out most others in term of flavor in cleveland. The environment is cool and the pizzas are AMAZING! Be careful because the red saucy has a little bite, but the Quattro formaggio is the best. Go here, you'll love it."}
{"text":"You know I promised myself a little while ago to not write anymore restaurant reviews because no two people will like and agree on the same things so what's the point, I thought I would just review places and activities but......

Then came along Saucy Brew Works and I ended up here because of their relationship with our hockey team the Cleveland Monsters, Saucy Brew Works  will allow you to order one free small pizza if the Monsters score the first goal and you bring them your game ticket therefore I've been eating a lot of free pizza and realized just how unique this place is.

They have a regular pizza menu that you mark down at the bar on an order pad with 19 options plus 3 sizes, they also have 4 different sandwiches, 2 staples and 3 salads and on the back side of the menu pad is a build your own option and the one I have been using, over and over and over again. 

The build your own menu selections are fantastic, you can choose between small, medium and large, you have 12 sauce options, 14 cheese options, 22 veggie and more options, 14 meat options and on the salads they have 4 greens options and 4 dressing options.

This Hockey season I've been through quite a few of these options and they were all quite good.

As for the Beer, Wine and Cider we run into the problem of everyone's tastes being different but my partner ordered both the wine and the cider and found them to be very good, especially the cider, as for myself I always ordered water but as a former beer drinker I know some beers can be good and some aren't but judging from the crowd it seems the beer offerings are quite good.

The place is large and very clean, the staff has always been friendly and polite and also very attentive without becoming intrusive, a very rare combination. The seating ranges from picnic style tables for large gatherings to intimate smaller tables with window views, also there is a loft area for that \"Cool\" feeling.

All in all I love Saucy Brew Works, it's a great place to go and hang out with your friends and have a good time, I hope you'll try them out.

{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday evening was pretty busy but it is new. Has a modern look to it more of a upscale type feel to it. They were out of some beers, but the one I had wasn't bad it was a IPA. Good lighting with an open feel to it."}
{"text":"Absolutely pittiful and terrible service. We got a door hanger delivered over the weekend and thought a weeknight pizza from the new place down the street would be good. We called for a delivery around 7:30. First time I called, the phone rang for a solid 5 minutes then finally someone picked up. We placed our order and were given a 45 minute time. Fine, it's dinner hour, I'm sure they were busy. Over an hour and a half later we get an automated text that the order is ready, no confirmation it was for delivery. Tried calling to confirm and phone just rang, and rang, and rang...no answer. Finally, a guy on a bike showed up at 9:10 and gave us every excuse, being short staffed and cooks quiting. We turned down delivery and went to Happy Dog instead. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"The beer was mediocre.  Prices were high.   Someone in our party did not like their fruit punch beer. We told the bartender and she gave us quite a bit of attitude why we didn't like it. She then charged us half price for a different beer.  Thanks a lot!?! Won't be back."}
{"text":"Place is dead now. They need servers and less sadness. Hopefully will be better in the summer, but still need servers."}
{"text":"I really liked the space. It is pretty spacious making it the proverbial anchor tenant of Hingetown. The garage doors to W29th St were raised making the space feel even more open. There are some design nods to the original purpose of the building and there are a couple comfortable seating areas: upstairs and by a fireplace. 

While I don't so much like sitting at a large table when I'm just out with a couple people, the large tables are of a really nice design and make the brewery great for big groups. There are also lots of well placed TVs which make Saucy a great spot to catch a game. 

On a Wednesday night the space was really loud, but there was a talented live keyboardist / singer providing entertainment. 

Service at the bar was provided by two bartenders who were friendly and attentive. Drinks were quickly served, refills were offered and once the pizza self-order forms were filled out they were quickly collected. 

You can make your own pizza or choose a pre-designed creation. I went with a basic Margherita: saucy red, mozzarella, tomato, basil, pecorino romano. The crust was thin and had just the right amount of snap to it. I liked the flavors on the pizza I was served and I enjoyed the taste of the \"saucy red.\" However I missed the truly traditional aspect of a Margherita pizza: there were no fresh balls of mozzarella on the pizza and the basil lacked its usual pungent punch. Oh, and you have to pick the pizza up yourself from the kitchen window.

Overall a good experience. If you want TVs, maybe have a big group and don't mind a loud atmosphere this is the spot to go."}
{"text":"Saucy in my opinion is the best place to go and get pizza in Ohio City. When you order a pizza you fill out a slip. You have the option of making your own or trying one of their own. Generally, I love to make my own pizza. It is fun to try out different cheeses, sauces, and proteins. Also you can choose between small, medium, and large. If you are making a personal pizza the small is a great. It  always fills me up. 

The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the serving issue. If you are ordering any drinks or food you have to go to the bar to do this. This is fine when the bar is not busy. But, if you are there on a busy night the lines become super long. So, someone has to go wait in line and put in the order while the other person holds down the table. I know that this has been a common complaint since it opened and it does not seem like it is going to change."}
{"text":"Ugh....... Come on, Saucy. You could be AWESOME. Seriously. Your beer is some of the best around. The albino stout is one of my favorite beers ever. But, it's a Saturday night and you make \"last call\" at 11:45pm? At midnight you turn all the lights on high and shut off the jukebox. What is up with this? We were ready to spend lots more money and hang out. What gives?"}
