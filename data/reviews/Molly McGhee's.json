{"text":"Typical Irish Bar. Above average bar food, decent wings, they go heavy on the sauce so I'd lay off a bit. But decent food, nothing to go crazy about. I'd say give it a try."}
{"text":"Molly McGhee's is one of my new favorite restaurants. I went there with my family last night, and we were in a bit of a hurry. Our server immediately came to our table and took our drink orders. The beers were cheap ($2.25 for a tall Miller Lite), and they were served perfectly cold. The service was equally quick when it came to our food, and the food was very good. I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak, which was very fresh and flavorful. My Mom also very much enjoyed her burger, and my Dad was happy with his Italian sub. The atmosphere is bright and lively, and they have a large back room that looks like it would be great for any party or fundraiser. I will definitely be back to Molly McGhee's."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from this place.... The worst experience of my life.. DO NOT eat the chicken tenders... You'll regret it."}
{"text":"A local Strongsville institution, but nothing to write home about here.

Typical local bar with pub grub on the menu. Wings here are decent, but unfortunately can be hit-or-miss in their doneness (sometimes undercooked).  Sampler appetizer platter in generous in size, but flavors are just average as most items are fried and are accompanied by dipping sauces.  I found their pizza to be surprisingly good, but would not come here just for that."}
{"text":"The food is typical bar food. Expect to be ignored if you are not one of the regulars. Service was terrible"}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a beer, but I won't eat here again.  My last visit on a Saturday afternoon had me sick from the chicken.  My daughter too. My friends wings looked like they should,have spent a bit more time in the fryer.  Service was slow too even though it was not very busy."}
{"text":"Been here twice.....great dive. I was a little suspect when I saw 99 bananas on the self but definitely a cool place to grab a beer and sandwich."}
{"text":"Found myself at Molly McGhee's because of a trivia final. Ended up getting the chicken paprikash soup (which was basically chicken paprikash - dumb), it was pretty good - nothing like my mom's.

Inexpensive bar food. Not terrible."}
{"text":"As far as bar food goes, Molly McGhee's is as good as it gets.  I love their loaded nachos, they are so yummy.  This is a rather big bar, and great to meet up with groups of family and friends when we are in town."}
{"text":"Typical bar with much better than average food. A bit noisy due to speakers too close to the patrons, but all things considered, a good value and fun."}
{"text":"Same as before.I would like to say the chicken paprikash was better as dinner, but some how the soup is much better. The dinner had more chicken and less sauce (taste). The food was not either really good or bad. The green beans were cooked AL dente but tasted frozen. The wings were nothing special either.
But the beer was cheap!"}
{"text":"Molly's is a fun place to go on a party night! The bartenders are very friendly and more than willing to do a shot or two with ya! It is festive and the food is pretty good, I usually get a Rheuban or some fries or something. I went there for Christmas in July and they had Great Lakes Christmas Ale on tap! 

I only have one complaint, otherwise I would give them the 5 stars. Molly's attracts the younger, I am tough look at me guys. I am talking all the wastes that wear Affliction and think they are tough. Not a single one has ever been in real fight, and I despise Affliction wearing, faux hawk sporting, Buckle jean cardboard cut outs. Just cause you wear an MMA shirt doesn't make you tough, cool, or even worth knowing. Sorry about my rant. I don't run around wearing my Everlast stuff... 

But all in all, fun place, good prices, and cool atmosphere. A little cramped though but that could just be all the Faux Hawks crowding me in..."}
{"text":"I had wings and fresh cut fries. Wings were done right. Fresh cut fries were eh. While it's not about the money for me, charging for a side of sauce on naked wings, celery, ranch just seems a little petty. But I get it if customers abuse that. $30.00 for wings, fries, 2 beers and 2 shots. Somewhat reasonable. Here's the good stuff, my server Hope was awesome! Attentive, nice and always cleaning. Locals are friendly. The place is clean and in good condition for the most part. I'm not sure I would consider this a food destination, but for a local Irish bar with bar food you can certainly do worse. Not a glowing endorsement but the third and fourth stars are for service. Well done Hope."}
{"text":"We just saw the cook walk out of the kitchen with a jug of seasoning, lick his finger, dip it in & then offer a buddy at the bar to taste it too, which he did. We asked what that was for- he says I'm gonna cook wings in it. We said that's unsanitary and gross. He shrugged & walked back in the kitchen. SO NASTY!!! DO NOT EAT HERE!! We obviously left. I'm glad we didn't order food, because we were about to."}
{"text":"This bar is right down the street from my house so we frequently go here. It's a great place to grab a quick bite with reasonable prices. The food is your typical bar food- sandwiches, wings, salads. I have ordered many things on the menu, but the grilled chicken salad is my usual go-to. The salad is HUGE and filling, which I like. The french onion soup is also one of my favorites. My family has ordered the wings for parties that we've had and they're always a big hit. I also enjoy coming here to enjoy the bar scene and trivia night on Wednesday."}
{"text":"If you like to watch abusive customers yell directly in the face of a server, while the management does nothing, then this is your place. 

On 1/3/16 I was in the area and decided to stop in for a quick bite. As I was finishing my meal, I witnessed what can only be described as blind rage. I watched as a large man in the back of the establishment, near the dartboards, verbally assaulted a server. The man repeatedly yelled directly into to her face (lowering to her much shorter altitude to do so), \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\", accompanied by various expletives. I couldn't make out much context. There's no way he wasn't spitting in her face. The server kept her cool and proceeded to finish what she was doing. I was close enough to the server station to witness how shaken she was by the ordeal, but she kept her self together and was professional throughout the incident. I spoke with someone who stated the man is a regular, possibly named \"Jim\". I did not see any action from management during the incident. I did see another customer who was upset over the episode attempt to make management aware, but I don't know where this went, because I left due to the uncomfortable nature of the situation.

I wouldn't even normally review a place like this unless it was exceptional. In this case the exception is not the food, the atmosphere, or the selection, but the customers. I've never seen such a terrible display of humanity go by unchecked. I really hope the management gets it together and makes it known that abusive behavior is not welcome. Or is it?!"}
{"text":"Stop by this rather large sports bar occasionally to meet friends for drinks and eats.  Located in a small strip mall with lots of adjacent parking.  Wide variety of pub grub on the menu.  Decent variety of beers available on tap.  Prices are good, wings are good and fries are hand-cut.  Servers generally around when you need them.  Dart boards inside but you have to bring your own darts."}
{"text":"I have been to Molly McGhee's too many times to count.  Every time I go I always say I will NEVER come back here. 

The service is awful.  You can wait 10-15 minutes for a drink on a slow night.  There are many times the bartender doesn't even acknowledge you waiting, sees one of their friends come up alongside of you, and just serve their friends.  

The last and final time I went here I ordered the buffalo chicken egg rolls.  I waited 30 minutes for them because one of the bartenders gave my food to another customer.

The food is actually pretty good, but the service is so awful its not worth going. Everytime I get dragged here there is one thing I will be sure off - horrible service."}
{"text":"OK, I think I may have found my new watering hole.  Not too many beers, but the ones they keep on tap are decent.  

I couldn't believe how many food items were on the menu - and they're pretty good and fast too.  

On top of all that, I have a favorite new bartender in Cleveland (no, I'm not telling you her name because I don't share well with others)."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this place because although the food is actually pretty good, the service usually sucks.  

I have seen bartenders drinking while on the clock and, typically, the waitresses are oblivious to anything going on around them and move at a snails pace. 

They do have weekly trivia which actually can be a blast (if you have all night to spend)!"}
{"text":"I consistently get good food here. Their wings maintain their crispness on the outside even when sauced, and are still juicy but not undercooked on the inside. They also have bacon ranch! Not artificially flavored store bought stuff but ranch with real bacon in it! I come here with about 20 people every year for my birthday and the service is always wonderful. I love this place."}
