{"text":"The Sportsman is an excellent deli located right near the Lakefront and Public Square. It is very unassuming from the outside, but believe me, the food doesn't reflect the exterior. Inside, the restaurant is not very wide, but it's very long. There is a bar running pretty much through the whole restaurant, with sports memorabilia on the wall, primarily Cleveland sports memorabilia. The tables are small and close together, and  you just seat yourself. The food is awesome, if not horribly artery clogging. They are famous for their corned beef. I had a Reuben and I must say it was the best Reuben I've ever had. Everything was perfect, although, again, it was artery clogging. I also ordered fries which were greasy and heavenly. Not the kind of food you should eat every day, but it's a worthwhile treat. If you're looking for excellent corned beef of any other greasy sandwich in Cleveland, look no further than the Sportsman on St. Clair."}
{"text":"How hard is it to make a sandwich? Honestly.   For $8.95 I got a heap of turkey, a heap of 30% processed ham (said so right on the package you look at while you wait), and a piece of processed cheese. No lettuce, onion, tomato, side of fries or chips. God, it was just so gross tasting.   For this price, I can get a sandwich of locally grown, unprocessed meat. Their rent must be pretty high to charge that much for so little.   This place is also cash only. I can't believe I paid for this sandwich.   p.s. What part of fake ham, turkey and cheese makes this a \"Bostonian Celebrity\"?"}
