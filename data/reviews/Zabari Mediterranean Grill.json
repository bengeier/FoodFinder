{"text":"First time here and loved it!  I had the beef schwarma. The steak was so tender. The fresh pitas are like nothing I've ever had!  Not your typical flat pita bread but a moist, chewy bread that reminded me of sourdough.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love their chicken shawarma!! And wonderful salads! Very clean. Lots of great tastes. I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"The shwarma is delicious and the portions are very large. The staff is polite and accomodating. The only criticism is the kitchen. It should be run as an assembly line, like other fast food restaurants  ( Chipotle, Qdoba, etc) instead of 1 person trying to do everything on the plate. Once they speed up the service the restaurant will be perfect."}
{"text":"Nice shawarma place with authentic food in a modern atmosphere.  I'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance. I lived in Israel for many years and I know good hummus and falafel. This place is the real deal. Thick homemade pita not that store bought stuff you get at most places. All family recipes and family service. Please come and support this place... we need to keep it!!!"}
{"text":"It's a family owned place and the owners are welcoming and friendly.  Amazing Shawarma and felafel, their pita is fresh and thick, entrees have large portions, and the service is friendly.    It's great for takeout or sit down, but if there's a line, it could take a few minutes; best to call ahead for pickup or if you're in a hurry.  I'm wanting to try the shakshuka; I've heard it's amazing too."}
{"text":"My mother and I stumbled on this gem of a restaurant while shopping in the area.  The food was so fresh and the portion sizes perfect.  Mom had a shawarma in pita, while I had the shawarma meal with my choice of three sides.  Of the sides, the eggplant is a must have--seriously, it is fantastic! The carrots were prepared perfectly, not soggy or too crunchy--just the right bite to them.  The hummus, well, I really wanted to lick the plate clean, but that is just not appropriate in a restaurant.  The chicken shawarma is prepared from scratch and you can see it on the spit when placing your order.  It was seasoned beautifully, as the spices did not overpower the flavor of the chicken.   What sealed our experience was the service.  My mother had an issue with her meal (not the fault of the restaurant, it was a personal preference), and they went out of their way to make her happy.  The thoughtfulness and understanding of the owner was a relief and greatly appreciated.  My family and I will be recommending as well as returning to this fabulous restaurant."}
{"text":"terrible. paid $17 for a lunch that consisted of a chicken pita and a tiny side of hummus. when i asked the manager about it, he was aggressive and confrontational. poor value, with even worse service.  \"if you loan someone $20 and never see them again, it's money well spent.\" that's how i feel about this place....$17 well spent to learn to never go back."}
{"text":"Some restaurants have delicious food. Some have excellent service. And some provide an uplifting experience.   Yet, seldom does one find a restaurant that combines all of these fine qualities into a perfect harmony.   Zabari is one of those unique restaurants. Indeed, Zabari belongs to the supreme rank of the creme de la creme of restaurants who enrich all of their customers, without exception, with a satisfied stomach, a warm heart, and an inspired spirit.   Fortunate are those who are privileged to experience Zabari. And fortunate and blessed is its owner who has brought this sublime Zabari gift to our world."}
{"text":"I came with my wife. we ordered two sandwiches a Falafel and a shuahrma the pita size is 25% smaller then a normal pita and  in the shuahrma sandwich was so little meat that I hardly felt it. we paid $21.00 with no side dish or drink. the food was tasty but with paper plats and this prices I am not going to come again or recommend to others. I know that kosher food cost more but this is over the top"}
{"text":"We went to Zabari for the first time tonight. You order at the counter and they bring it to you. The staff was so friendly and helpful as we were deciding what to order. They even made a little plate with samples for us to try. Everything was so fresh and flavorful, we loved it!  Our favorites were the baba ganoush, hummus, pita and schwarma. Everything was flavored to perfection. We'll definitely be back! I can't wait to try their falafel!"}
{"text":"Place is definitely a refreshing change compared to our current kosher market; very nice facility, quality food, extremely nice and attentive staff, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Guys , this is the one !! 10 years around USA I'm looking for a real Israeli-Mediterranean grill and I found it here in Phoenix . One of the best shawarma ever !!!"}
{"text":"Food & service was excellent! The salads were fresh and tasty. The meat was seasoned perfectly!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for KOSHER, fresh & healthy food option - this is the place for you.    We tried the steak Kebob and chicken shawarma - both were very good!   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Super fresh authentic middle eastern food. Love their Pita bread.  Restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"The food is good, this is coming from Egyptian who knows how Mediterranean food should taste. The place is really clean."}
{"text":"Do you ever long for great Mediterranean food? This place has it! The recipes are from the owners mum and she must be a great cook. The food was fresh, tasty and filling. Service was excellent, we felt welcome and everything was ready in a short time. The ambience is casual and relaxed. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food !! Ambience was ok but the food taste and people working their were so amazing! Greet you like you are so special to them! I honestly enjoyed every bite of food! We ordered chicken shwarma and it was delicious! Quantity was huge!! Remember if you like spicy food ask for more hot, it's yummy!! Loved everything!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to the soft opening tonight.  Everything was delicious!  Best Pita in the valley for sure!  We are all the salads, they were all well seasoned and expertly prepared.  I especially loved the tomato roast pepper salad and the red cabbage slaw!  The hummus was excellent as was the tahini.  We also really enjoyed the chicken, falafel and kabob (clearly we ate a lot :-p)  The baklava was the perfect ending- it was more than just pastry with nuts soaked in honey. There was a lot of flavor to it- more spices.  Really an exceptional baklava.  We will be back often."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place by mistake  I have to say it was five stars all around  From the atmosphere to the food  Very clean tasty Mediterranean food  Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Great kosher israeli style food. Good food and very clean place. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Israeli/Middle Eastern food. LOVE this place."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant. The food and service for this fast, casual place exceeded expectations. Additionally, the restrooms and facilities were very clean and the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Great Israeli/Mediterranean food in Phoenix. I love the hummus and mushroom plate, the shnitzel, shawarma, burekas, salads, deserts and more. I've visited here at least 5 times and the food and service were always excellent. The plates are pretty big and filling which is great for lunch or dinner. Authentic with the perfect ambience. Would definitely recommend and sure to be back."}
{"text":"They are still in the soft opening phase.  Nice casual environment food was fresh and tasty.  Service was very good.   The nice young gentleman that served my was a Real \"MENTCH\""}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!! It took going there one time to know I'll be a lifetime customer"}
{"text":"Quick service and food  taste amazing very clean and inviting atmosphere definitely recommended"}
{"text":"i tried the catering for a small gathering this week. Yair helped me plan and order the entire meal. the order was ready when it was promised, it was packaged for presentation and for rewarming where needed, and it was delicious, as evidenced by the amount devoured by my friends. i will do this again."}
{"text":"This is a huge hidden gem. The food was amazing. I could have eaten a gallon of hummus with their pita bread. The falafel plate was also great. They have a bunch of choices for salad sides."}
{"text":"Terrific authentic Mediterranean food such as shawarma, kabobs, etc. very generous portions and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"First time here and this place is amazing best middle eastern food must check it out!!"}
{"text":"Ok, the only reason I'm here is because most favorite place is closed for a family vacation. I was pleasantly surprise at how friendly these folks were.  Very helpful,  letting you taste stuff before you ordered,  I liked that.  I ordered the falafel pita, it was moist and very tastie with the Israeli sale they pile on top. The fries were delicious too! I however,  did not like the canned soda and no ice either.  For a $12 lunch,  I expect a little more than a can of soda.  This place is set up more like a deli,  not full table service."}
{"text":"Husband went for take out over an hour! My chicken on my hummus was not cooked or frozen or something, not sure. The color scared me. Hummus was bland and Pita was burnt. Not worth wait or money"}
{"text":"Delicious food great service and decent prices this is a gem in the rough must try the falafel it's amazing. Defiantly will come back for more."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! My in laws are Israeli so we are really critical when we go out to eat to any middle eastern cuisine. I got the falafel and it wasn't dry at all. The flavors were really good. I would recommend this place to anyone even if you don't keep kosher!!"}
{"text":"So good! We are so glad you opened so close to us. Food was delicious. Service was great. Very clean. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here once, but I'll come back regularly, as much for the warm and helpful people as the food. We ordered the Zabari Mix platter to try a lot of different items. It includes grilled chicken, chicken shawarma, beef kabob, and beef shish kabob, and includes 3 side salads. All so good it was hard to decide which I liked best."}
{"text":"Amazing, wow. Just finished my meal and it's feels so good. I'm very into healthy clean food and this place definitely is that. I was very impressed. Felt like a very traditional restaurant, didn't look it at all but the feeling is there. Very cool too that I could just order through yelp, was super easy and got notifications on the. It would be ready and when it was ready. I got the beef kabob and falafel entrees. They came with plenty on rice, delicious and 3 salad sides. We got so much food for 3 people and have left overs. I could tell everything was fresh and will for sure be returning."}
{"text":"Best falafel, hands down. All of the salads are terrific as well. And the pita! Warm, soft. My new favorite Mediterranean restaurant by far."}
{"text":"Too expensive for their offerings and location.  I ordered the Kofta Pita, which was just okay.  It didn't come with anything other than some chopped vegetables and for the price of $9.95 was rather small.  I prefer the more reasonable prices of ZK Grill which is a little further from my home but worth the drive.  My recommendation would be to lower your prices on all sandwiches and entrees by at least $2.00."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for Mediterranean/traditional Middle Eastern food. I have gotten a shawarma sandwich a few times and this time I got the shawarma entree that came with pita and salads. Portion was good. I would highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Great kosher grill . Been there twice and both time I had good experience. Got the shawarma plate and the ground kabab plate . Meats and the salads were very good both times fresh taste and nice portion ."}
{"text":"The Best food in town. Shwarma Plate is amazing . We come here every week and love everything about this place. Th salads that come with the meal are amazing . I would recommend everyone to this place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this kosher restaurant! While they are still new and we had a couple of mistakes in our order, they rectified them and gave us a free dessert. All good was very tasty and authentic. Would definitely recommend Zabari and eat there again."}
{"text":"If you like Middle Eastern food, you found the place. Shawarma, Falafel, Humus, Shnitzel, and so much more. They are very generous with portions and food is delicious. It's the best Kosher spot that I've found so far in Arizona."}
{"text":"First time here. Delicious food, very friendly staff. If you are considering trying it, you should!"}
{"text":"This place is great! A hidden gem. It's family owned and operated, which I loved. The restaurant was clean and tastefully decorated. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious! I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Waited for ever for this place to open . You can tell that the owners take great pride in the food and service, this is actually my second time here except I forgot to take pictures of my food the first time around. It's tasty , relatively inexpensive and good for a healthier dinner .Everything seems to be made from scratch and their pitas are amazing. Absolutely delicious. Also if you like shawarma this definitely is the place to try ."}
{"text":"Zabari's is a little gem of a restaurant. The Shwarma, falafel, hummus and yellow rice will transport you to your favorite Shwarma spot in J'lem! Service is friendly and efficient. Prices, reasonable. Hope they consider getting a wine/beer license and add some grilled salmon, tuna, a seriously high quality bone-in rib eye steak to the menu...A girl can dream I'll be back and so will you if you go.:)"}
{"text":"Tried to go there yesterday and they've unfortunately closed. Hope the best for this family"}
{"text":"Came for first time with whole family on a Sunday night. Sons hungry after a day of basketball. Ordered seconds on tasty grape leaves. Shawarma pita was juicy, well-seasoned and delicious. Grilled chicken plate was a good portion with enough rice to share. Our little guy went back for a second hot dog. Very friendly staff and owner (brought over mango curry sauce to try). Nice to see another good kosher option. Casual, and reasonable prices. Nice, modern decor We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a great authentic Israeli restaurant with great shwarma, falafel, hummus, etc.  And surprisingly the grilled steak is very good and comes in a generous portion.  I highly  recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This wonderful restaurant is almost like being IN Israel!  FANTASTIC!!!"}
{"text":"what an amazing place!! fantastic food great service . fresh! authentic! and bursting with palate pleasing flavor! finally a true Mediterranean grill that you can sink your teeth into! This place just became my favorite place ..the salads prepared fresh ..the grilled meats ..spiced and cooked to perfection ..A must for any true foodie !"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of shwarma in my short life time and I've never had a chicken shwarma like at Zabari. The pita was soft and warm, and filled with the perfect ingredients to accompany the chicken inside. My Jewish friend who came with me vouched for the authenticity.   Side note: A lot of people here will complain about it's high price, but remember that you are getting AUTHENTIC Israeli and KOSHER foods it is worth it. Kosher foods come at a high price because of the process of making the meats kosher. If these things, don't matter to the customer DON't come."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the shawarma place with rice and sides. Really delicious and fresh food. It's a huge portion and also comes with a pita on the side! It's a bit pricey as I'm guessing that it's kosher meat, which is more expensive than your regular meat. Seems like a family owned business, so it was nice to support them. Clean place and delicious food. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Best falafel in Phoenix.   All the sauces are authentic.   Great pita bread.  Everything i have tried i have enjoyed.  Get your Tel Aviv fix in PHX"}
{"text":"Mediterranean food at is finest, delicious Hummus and Falafel, Tasty Pita bread , wide open dining Area, this place makes me feel like I'm in Israel."}
{"text":"Have now been here twice.  Chicken schwarma and hummus terrific.  The beef giro also very good.  Good value.  Kosher if that matters to you."}
{"text":"This place is 5 star. Great staff, friendly and welcoming. This food is amazing. I would recommend this to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Pita's are quite good, everything else is 2-3. The steak was super tough and dry. Hummus was oddly sweet. The Workers are friendly but not sure I'd return. Nothing stands out"}
{"text":"Nice little spot. Difference here compared to other Mediterranean spots is the have this chili sauce you can put on your pitas! Also, tziki sauce in a bottle! You can badically drown your food. Other notes include meat cooked on a spigot, friendly service and clean place."}
{"text":"We had shawarma pita and beef kabob plate - highly recommend both.  This was our first time at this restaurant and we were happy with our choices - both were very flavorful and authentic! When we visit again, we will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I have eaten in Zabari many times and every time I come here I enjoy the food , especially the Shawarma and the great customer service . I love that place . I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Terrible place!! Don't waste your money or time!! We walked in and my son had a Starbucks cup and they didn't say anything. They brought us our food then said we could not be there with a cup from the outside. so I said OK and the guy said, it's ok this time. then somebody else came up and harassed us again and said we couldn't be there with the cup so we had to end up taking our food and leaving. It was the worst experience and the  food was horrible."}
{"text":"Israeli food and Kosher, no less in Phoenix!  The selection of food and homemade salads are reminiscent of Israeli cuisine. We enjoyed the chicken shawarma, hummed and various salad side dishes. Don't miss this!"}
{"text":"Zabari Mediterranean Grill is a casual restaurant where you order at the counter and seat yourself. Zabari is a little different than many of the other Mediterranean Restaurants out there. Your getting Mediterranean Food with an Israeli spin that is Glatt Kosher. That means it's kosher plus no diseased animals are used. This is a family owned business. The mother is the chef and her son was working the counter. The son was very friendly to us. He explained the food and gave us samples to try. We ordered and sat ourselves.  Soon we have a whole table of food with extra condiments of pickled mango sauce, hot green shrug sauce SUPER HOT red shrug sauce and fresh baked pita breads.  I start with the Falafels. Very Crunchy and Moist and Very Fluffy and Flavorful. These are Outstanding Falafels. Babaganush has lots of eggplant in it and is very creamy and is also on the sweet side. Hummus is very creamy.  Then we have 6 sides of vegetables. The Israeli salad is simply diced tomatoes and cucumber in a light vinaigrette. Carrots are really delicious and are laced with cumin. The MATBUCHA is INSANELY DELICIOUS (Tomato and Pepper Salad). We also had an Eggplant Salad that was also delicious.  Now to the meat plate.  The grilled white meat chicken was nicely seasoned. Some of it was very tender and some pieces not so much.(The pickled mango sauce is super yummy on the grilled chicken) We tried Ground Beef Kabob and a Tri Tip Shish Kabob. I liked the Tri Tip over the Ground Beef better. But what was really GREAT was the caramelized CHICKEN SHAWARMA that was oozing with juice and flavor. IT WAS THE BOMB! Best chicken shawarma I ever had anywhere.  Portions are very large. We ordered two entrees and had plenty of leftovers.  GET THE CHICKEN SHAWARMA, FALAFELS, MATBUCHA, EGGPLANT and CARROTS!  4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Uh oh saba's you have some serious competition! Amazing selection of veggie dishes from scratch delish pita moist yet whole grain which I have no idea where it comes from I have never seen anything that good that you can buy at the store. BEST fries ever! They are basically your typical fries that you get at a Greek restaurant but for some reason these are extra crispy outside starchy inside but are made to order so they come super hot. Next time I will try an actual entrée but today I just got a veggie pita sandwich and it was fabulous! Place is extremely clean and actually very warm and cozy let's make this neighborhood joint a success!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean restaurant in town you must check it out. I order the falafel love it. I opted not to get the rice and got fries instead. All of the salads are delicious and made by his mother. Owners are personal and customer service oriented."}
{"text":"The shawarma is incredible! Upon taking the first bite, so many memories came rushing in from my time in Israel. These guys know how to do Israeli food not just well, but insanely well!"}
{"text":"Everything was good. I thought the prices seemed steep, but after eating, I thought for the quality I got, it was a good deal.  Very flavorful."}
{"text":"Zabari Mediterranean Grill make it again , It's my 10th visit here. I ordered the Zabari Mix  All the food was cooked perfectly like I like it ! The appetizers, all the salads and today was a huge upgrade for me . The daily soup was a delicious mushrooms soup ... Highly recommended to all my friends...  If it's your first time here try the chicken shawarma pita  And don't forget to ask for the AMBA spice & the thini"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! I always get the usual chicken shawarma, I love love love it, but I see photos and really wana try the combo meat platter. Owner is so nice and remembers my husbands and I order when we come in, always helping around in his restaurant and making sure everyone is happy. Food speaks for its self! I pray they keep it up, because Its our go to dinner place when I don't cook ha ha ha"}
{"text":"The 5 star reviews are warranted, the food here is excellent and the portions will fill you up. For $17 after tax, I was able to get 2 Grilled Chicken Breasts, 2 scoops of rice, and 3 choices of sides (of which there were so many good looking options I had a problem choosing). Everything is seasoned excellently, and you can tell they have made it that day. My only complaint is the prices, which are kinda high for a normal restaurant, but for Kosher food it is reasonable."}
{"text":"I have spent years of my life in Israel, and I can say that Zabari is the most authentic Israeli food you'll be able to find in Arizona. Although it's \"Mediterranean\" food, this place is 100% Israeli cuisine that you would find walking the streets of Tel Aviv.   We came for lunch and settled on a shwarma pita and the mix grill plate.   The shwarma pita was PERFECT. I opted for the fries to be put in the pita and it was amazing. The meat was seasoned well, the pita was fluffy and grilled nicely and the toppings like salad, hummus and tahini were all fresh and delicious.  The mix grill plate came with rice, a choice of 3 salads and a few different types of meat. We chose the babaganouj, hummus, and Israeli salad as sides and we were very pleased with the meal....although I would say that $22 for the plate was way too expensive.   The restaurant is new, clean, and has fantastic service and we will definitely be back to enjoy their awesome food.   Such a great find."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mediterranean food I have ever had,I came in today with my brother and it was just so delicious and savory definitely recommended for anyone who likes Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Great, solid place with delicious fresh food. Their pitas are warm and fluffy with beautiful flavor. The hummus is creamy and smooth. The shawarma is nicely seasoned and not overdone. The food tastes authentic. We don't live in Arizona but we will definitely be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"Fantastic friendly restaurant with authentic middle eastern / Jewish food! Super clean and nicely decorated. Most importantly, the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is delish!! Hummus and bread is my favorite. My boyfriend and I shared the Zabari Mix together. Yum! The staff is super friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service , very professional and very clean place . The people over there very nice and friendly , defiantly will come back"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the chicken shawarma pita and sauces that came with. Incredible juicy chicken, very flavorful, pita was soft and fresh. I also had a side of hummus and it was spot on and authentic."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've had in the valley, I drive from Tempe to eat there a few times a month, I wish they were closer. Fresh food made with real Ingridients, authentic flavors. Everything I've had is delicious but my favorite is the Shawarma. Good options for vegetarians as well with very good salads such as Hummus, tomato eggplant, matbucha, cabbage salad and really good falafel as well."}
{"text":"We ate there tonight for the first time - not the last.  Nice, friendly staff. Clean. Food Excellent - Of course, being a Kosher restaurant, we should expect to pay more (someone else complained - ).  I'm just happy that after so many years here, we now have kosher choices.  Thank goodness Zabari is very good!"}
{"text":"Second time in today, and it was the second time in one week! A friend and I can attest to the quality of their baba ganoush, mushroom hummus (fantastic!), and the falafel. If you're a falafel fan, this is precisely how you want it done...crunchy outside, creamy inside. Today I had the chicken shwarma pita, and it's moist and mouthwatering. My only regret is that I live so close by because I am about to get addicted. One more thing, the staff here is extremely friendly and really pays attention to pleasing customers. When I entered, I got a friendly, \"Welcome back!\""}
{"text":"This was the best Mediterranean meal I've ever had!   Authentic recipes all made from scratch daily."}
{"text":"Good food, but small portions. Ambiance is great, really goes well with the type of cuisine. I'd go back, I'd just be prepared to order an extra plate for the table because you will need it."}
{"text":"This was my 1st visit here, defiant NOT my last one. Fresh healthy tasty food with lots of salads, pita bread and generous servings per dish..  couldn't finish my food but couldn't stop eating as well.. so I'm taking a break to post this review and going back for round 2 in couple of minutes...  Friendly staff, good vibe, amazing food.. highly recommended!!   P.S. - Try the Bourekas (caution - its HOT)!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Israeli food. Freshly made pitas, delicious chicken shawarma and the eggplant with tomato is addicting! I'm in town for a week and plan on coming back to try the schnitzel and babaganoush."}
{"text":"The shawarma was  delicious but the potato bourekas  seemed like they were from a box not freshly made  re reheated"}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing. The falafel is to die for and the Shawarma is totally awesome. Staff is very friendly and Yair the owner is very accommodating. I will definitely go back and bring friends next time!!"}
{"text":"While I was visiting family in Phoenix we went to this Zabari for dinner one night. There were 3 of us and one had a dietary restriction - no oil/fats in preparation. They grilled a chicken breast perfectly and as directed with no problem. The 2 of us shared a salad plate which had 4 salads on it. The humus was very good, and since it's not my favorite, that is high praise! The carrot salad was a little spicy for my taste but yummy and my sister loved it. I loved the eggplant salad. I have no idea what was in it besides eggplant but it was outstanding. Don't miss it. We both thought the cut up vegetable salad needs a little more lemon but that was easy enough to remedy. We also had a ground beef sandwich in a pita. Unfortunately I cannot recall its name but it contained 2 oblong logs of ground beef with exceptional spicing. Don't know what but out of this world. There was also humus in the pita and I would have eaten more if it if it were in there! There was a tahini sauce for the pita and sandwich which was likely the best tahini I've ever had. And the pita was thick and fluffy and really good.  If you find yourself in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area and want a great meal, try this place. Order at the counter and you get a number and your food is brought by a server.  And when you go you must get the eggplant salad. Next time I get out there I will return!"}
{"text":"Finally they opened! Amazing Mediterranean food, close to my house and the place is clean and beautiful.  Friendly service. We ate a bunch of different dishes to try, shwama, falafel, kebab, hummus and it was amazing.   Don't forget to order baklava at the end."}
{"text":"Authentic middle eastern food served hot and fresh, we will be back. Update - the matbucha and shakshuka are killer"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and was a little sceptical after hearing staff were rude etc, but had a very pleasant experience, food and service were good. I do not usually write reviews but felt the need. I also told the manager what a nice first trip there ."}
{"text":"The server didn't bring me the drink I ordered and informed me that the drinks are located in the front and that the customers had to go pick it up themselves. Which is fine with me BUT the Israeli juice I ordered was located behind the counter. On top of that, the server offered another lady sitting 3 tables away from me to grab the drink for her. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"First time visitor with a work colleague.  Greeted when we came in.  Always a great way to start.  Looked at the menu and told about it, then they gave us samples of the salads to taste.  The eggplant one was out of this world as was the pepper one.  Then we each ordered the sampler entree (I forgot the name).  While we waited Yair gave us felafel samples and tehina.  Not expected but great customer service.  Each meat/chicken was well seasoned and distinctly seasoned.  Not oily, which means it was fresh. Stared at the pita and finally gave in to the carbs.  Amazing.  The restaurant was spotless.  The staff was courteous and brought out the food.  Yair (spelling?) came out and asked how the food was and asked if we needed anything.  Definitely will be back!  Great job!!!'  Good value!!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, fast service friendly staff. We had a mix grill it came with 3 salads enough for 2 people with some leftover. The place is kosher and it priced lower than others kosher places."}
{"text":"We came over to try the place, and I'd tell you the place is bomb!!! Very friendly staff nice background music, and tasty food."}
{"text":"My favorite shawarma place. They are so friendly and the food is amazing owner know how to make shawarma."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Friendly staff. Authentic. I usually get the grilled chicken plate with baba, Israeli salad and hummus."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch with the family. My favorite chicken swarma in town. Solid hummus, babaganoush, and falafel. My little guy lived their Barekas.   The staff was really friendly and got us out food quickly."}
{"text":"Had higher hopes but this place is really expensive for what you get.  I paid $29 for two pita meals.  2.5 stars   Pros:  the pita is outstanding!   Cons:  skimp on the meat  Ordered the shish kebab pita for 11 dollars and added the bottled soda and fries for $3.50 more.  Comes with a VERY small side of fries and the pita was stuffed with so much cucumber salad I had to go get a fork and dump a lot of it out and tried to spread the very small amount of steak throughout the pita.  Even with the tahini spread it just didn't have that much flavor.  Overall if the steak to pita ratio was good and maybe more seasonings - this would be worth coming back for.  My son got the grilled chicken pita and he experienced the same thing, he asked me if I ordered him chicken because he couldn't find it.  He also dumped out a lot of the cucumber filler.  I also wanted to try a boureka, just one but he said I would have to order the $7.00 appetizer if I wanted to try it.  Not sure why I couldn't just order one alacarte.    I do like how they have a hand washing station in the dining room.  I used it - it's great.  What I didn't care for was all the staff was wearing gloves but I'm not sure why because they were touching and handling everything, I'm hoping it wasn't for handling food.  2.5 because the place was clean and the food was ok, but I wasn't really impressed enough to spend more money there."}
{"text":"Loved the food, too bad they were out of shawarma, but that means that it was good. The owners did a great job at remodeling the place,  the decor is very modern n chic. Had a great feel"}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner tonight at their special event.  Very nice place to sit, it's modern and inviting.   As for the food, where do I begin? We ate so much!   Borekas, Salads, Kebab, Shwarma, Falafel, Meatballs, Moroccan fish & Baklava  The bourekas were just right, tasty not too much pastry and fillings were savory.   The salads were yummy! Madbucha & hummus were my favorite, but that's just my personal preference always... they also had baba ganoush and slaw, very good!   The falafel was fresh and crispy, good taste. Kebabs were grilled, juicy & tasted fantastic.  Meatballs we're in a delicious red smokey sauce accompanied with real couscous.   The cherry on the top for me was the baklava! It was probably one of the best I've had. It wasn't too sweet and the filling was cinnamony which I can't resist!   We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"First time here today and everything is soooo good. The staff was very kind, answered all questions and let us sample things before ordering. A little pricey but the food is fresh and good quality, ive been to cheaper places where i felt like i just wasted the money"}
{"text":"Normally I don't leave bad reviews, but this is the one exception. From the moment my mother and I walked in no one said hello to us. We had Starbucks in our hands as we were ordering and no one said anything. The same guy who took our order (who saw us with our Starbucks) came up to us with our food and said \"sorry we can't have outside drinks in here\" ok which I understand, but this is not a 5 star restaurant and they do not offer anything but water.  5 minutes later after we already feel I un-welcomed a women who worked there came up and asked us to leave because of our Starbucks drinks. Keep in mind the guy said it was OK this time who brought our food. For someone who is well traveled this is by far the WORST service I have ever seen. I feel like we were being discriminated against because I'm gay. I can't think of any other reason why they would harass us!  No where in the restaurant does it say \"no outside drinks\". This place deserves zero stars..! We also found hairs in our food from the to-go box that the lady who asked us to leave. We should have been told as soon as we walked in no outside drinks. This place is embarrassing to classic mediterranean restaurants, and I expect much better. Do not come here! A waist of your time and money!"}
{"text":"First time at this place, very fast and kind service! We tried the sdawarma pita and it was absolutely delicious, as well as the house sauces. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday.  And then again today.  I'll likely eat through the whole menu in the coming months.  Can't believe it took me 6 months to find this gem.    Best casual isreali spot in the valley."}
{"text":"If this glatt kosher restaurant were more upscale, it would definitely be five star. The food is outstanding. The salads had great flavor although I would suggest a bit of acid in the babaganoush. The meats too were well prepared. The bread is outstanding. The ambiance is informal and the staff friendly. Just get rid of the plasticware and paper plates and add full service and this place would deserve not five stars but more. So nice to have good kosher Israeli food added to the valley's restaurant repertoire."}
{"text":"We just ate at a perfect casual restaurant loved it they were helpful and friendly. Food was great. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Today was my first time coming to this restaurant and I really loved it ! Some of my friends highly recommended this place and they were right ! Great food that reminds us of home !"}
{"text":"This is a really good place to eat. However, they observe the sabbath and are closed Friday night and all day Saturday. The cost is comparable to other similar places."}
{"text":"So as someone who comes from the Middle East, my standards are somewhat different from the average American since I know first hand how this kind of food should taste.   To me a middle Eastern restaurant that doesn't use extra virgin olive oil cannot claim to be Middle Eastern, as it a very important ingredient in that region's cuisine.  Them not using olive oil partially explains why the food was far from great or even good.   Admittedly I was disappointed with the food.  The staff there seemed very nice.   But I think most people would agree that we pay to get good food.  This restaurant has great room for improvement.  Unfortunately they lost this customer."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab togo, food is exceptional. Portion size was lite for a 23 dollar plater.  I will give them time to work out the kinks then write a fallow up review. I repeat, exceptional food."}
{"text":"I always fall for a freshly made lunch option. My hubby and I split the Chicken Shawarma Plate. Definitely enough for two if you add another homemade fluffy Pita. Love that they bring you a squeeze bottle of Tzaziki with additional spicy sauces to adorn this satisfying lunch. Great sides. We had the babaganoush, hummus and Israeli salad. They were the perfect creamy, savory and crunchy addition to our lunch. Family run and friendly."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant! I've been everywhere in the US and tried some  Israeli restaurants, but this is so far the best. An authentic Israeli food! Brings out memories where I used to leave in Israel. Feels close at home. Great food and great people!.."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken hummus app and shawarma pita over an hour ago. Sill have not gotten it. Maby I'll find out if the food is any good."}
{"text":"The way they put hummus and salad in the pita is amazing.  Falafel and shawarma are a must try."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my husband on a summer Wednesday night. Pretty good crowd considering the heat and the night. We had an excellent meal! Great variety of food, good quality Israeli food and a casual but nice atmosphere. I had the falafel entree with hummus, eggplant salad, and corn salad. So much food I am stuffed. It was delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh wow! Best Mediterranean's food I've had in the USA in a long time! A group of 6 of us went and got multiple dishes to share so we could taste many  of the  items on the menu.   We got one hummus with chicken and one with shawarma plus a babaganoush and a bourekas appetizer and a shnitzel plate with salad and picked vegetables. The servings were a decent size and everything was absolutely delicious. The textures and flavours were spot on: the pita was hot and fluffy; the hummus was smooth and creamy; the shnitzel coating was crispy; the salads were fresh; and the pickles and pickled vegetables were just the right amount of spicy. The only thing missing was a lemon to squeeze on top of the shnitzel!  Service was fast and friendly, and there was plenty of seating (plus high chairs for the littlest ones). In short, a fantastic place that I would love to eat at again!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here and this restaurant is becoming my favorite place. Very welcoming! The best shawaram in town. amazing food and friendly staff. highly recommended!"}
