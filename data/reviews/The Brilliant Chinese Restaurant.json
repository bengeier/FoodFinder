{"text":"I've been to this restaurant for both lunch and dinner now and am pleased with the quality of the cuisine.  While the lunch menu was quite traditional with nothing very exciting, the quality was consistent and the food was flavorful.  There are some interesting dishes for dinner though and we had the seafood dumpling and a crispy chicken stuffed with sticky rice which was superb!  This is a restaurant I will go back to even though it's not that close to my house.  Prices are reasonable - good value for well-made tasty food."}
{"text":"Typical dim sum and not too busy on a weekend morning. Great prices."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is now closed, and will be taken over by the owners of the \"Casa\" group.  Hope the chef stays."}
{"text":"My parents always go out to Chinese restaurants for special occasions and we have been coming here for many years now. In all the years this restaurant has the most consistent and good food, it has always been a good experience.

I'm sure we'll be coming back here many more times."}
{"text":"My Sum was Dimmed I guess.  (Dim Sum, literally meaning \"to touch your heart-- Sum = heart).   Not because of the food per se, but had a blast with fellow yelpers thanks to Yvonne T's UYE along with her friends.

We ate, and ate... and ate.. and ate and ate (Think Itchy and Scratchy).  The food was ok.  Some interesting dishes that I liked and don't generally have included deep fried egg plants, and a bean curd egg white veggie dish.  The other dishes were just ok.  Typical Har Gows, Cheung Funs, Sui Mais, Fung Jaows, but nothing wowed me.   The Green Tea Mochi was something else unique, but I've had better.

The price was decent, and not having to wait because they took reservations made it better.  

Typical level of Asian cleanliness (which is to say not very).  The carpets leading to the washrooms were nasty to say the least.  Obviously the place had been flooded recently as they still had giant fans in the back, and the walls and floors were still stained.  I made sure I didn't look into the kitchen just in case I saw something I didn't want to see.  

I can't remember the name of the previous restaurant in it's place, but it used to be an uber cheap dim sum place.  I used to frequent it quite a bit when I needed to \"treat\" the extended family.  But the line ups used to be crazy in the previous incarnation.    Even if we didn't have reservations this time around, the line wasn't too bad for 12:30pm.

Anyways, if I had to pick a \"median\" for all my dim sum experiences in my life, this place would be it.


Was it Brilliant?  Well.. the place was well lit, but I'm not sure it sparkled."}
{"text":"I convened at the Brilliant Chinese Restaurant today with my sister, her friend, and my best friend in tow, along with fellow Yelpers Karl R, Tony F, Roma, and Wayne C.  Great turnout and I had a smashingly good time... there was even a mini after-party at Starbucks where a full onslaught of Big 2 ensued.  This brought out Karl R.'s uber-competitive side and we learned a few new French words.... Lol

I was able to make a reservation, which IMHO is a big plus and definitely much appreciated.  When we arrived the place was pretty busy.  I had been to this restaurant before when it was under different management.  It had been about 2 years since.  Not much has changed save for minor adjustments in the decor.

We ordered the following dishes (from what I can remember):
Chiu Chow Style Dumplings
Beef Balls
Beef Rice Noodle Roll
Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll
Shrimp Dumplings
Pork Siu Mai
Black Bean Braised Chicken Feet
Beef Tripe
Bok Choy w/ Egg-White Bean Curd (Tony F.'s attempt at adding a vegetable to our meat-laden meal)
Deep-Fried Taro Dumpling
Calamari
Deep-Fried Eggplant
Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf
Chicken Siu Mai
Coconut \"Pudding\"
Green Tea Mochi (Rice Cakes)
Custard Roll (Malay style)
Korean-Style Short Ribs

We may have ordered other dishes, but that was all I could recall from memory.  I think that the items that really stood out for me were the Korean-Style Short Ribs, Custard Roll, Green Tea Mochi, Coconut Pudding, and Deep-Fried Eggplant.

The Korean-Style Short Ribs were really flavourful.  The custard roll was soft and eggy.  The Green Tea Mochi is not something you see often on a dim sum menu, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the inside was a custard filling.  My favourite filling for anything is custard!  The coconut flakes that it was rolled in was also sublime.  The deep-fried eggplant batter was amazing... don't know what they do differently to it, but it was good.  It was a bit too salty, and judging from the \"orange-y\" colour that dusted the top, my guess is that it was dusted with salted egg yolk... The coconut pudding was also quite tasty.

All in all, the bill came to $12 a head including tax and tip (this was with a 10% discount).  It is not the BEST dim sum I've had, but it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum is probably one of the best east Asian cures for a hangover. Many of you may not know that dim sum is Cantonese* for 'Fear not, little one, that pain and headache will be gone soon'.

While I tend to be a rather safe eater in dim sum restaurants(no squishy textures, beef, cuttle fish, etc.) I've never had any issues finding a large assortment of my favourite dishes; siu mai, har gow, shrimps in a blanket, steamed bok choi, I did have a bit of an issue finding things that were more to my liking here. Those who just eat fish, may also be somewhat dissappointed with the selection. I did enjoy what we ordered, though. I loved the steamed vegetables with egg dish, as well as the siu mai, one of which went flying off my chopsticks. 

Service was status quo, as per Dim sum restos in the area. I did love the lazy susan though, and it's usually taken for granted until it's absent. While the restaurant is not as clean as some of the dim sum restaurants in the Pacific Mall area, parking here is less painful.

{"text":"The google map makes this appear like it's located in the northern end of the Pacific Mall parking lot. It's actually further north on the west side. It's at Gorvette and Kennedy, south of Dennison. There'a BK in the parking lot. You can't miss it. Parking seems pretty decent. Lots of these strip malls are just nightmare parking fests.

Okay. How was the dim sum? In my honky experience, the second best I've ever had. I've had dim sum in 3 nations and 4 cites: GTA, Vancouver, Seattle, and Seoul. Okay at a place called Jackie Chan's Kitchen in Seoul you don't expect great dim sum and you don't get great dim sum. My favorite all time experience was at a hole in the wall place near SEATAC airport. Can't even remember the name. When you're honky, you leave the dim summary up to your Chinese friends. Just show up, eat what's in front of you, pay your share.

The dessert round was actually kind of nice. There were some coconut green tea balls, kind of like mochi, but with a custard filling. Though I don't eat gelatinous food there were some cubes of gelatinous coconut that were pretty good. The D&D geek in my couldn't help but think of the Gelatinous Cube creature (http://www.artistxerocreations.com/images/Gelatinous_Cube.jpg) from the Monster Manual. That's the kind of asshole dining partner I am, I guess.

Anyway, pretty decent service. We got all the things we ordered. Everyone ate their fill and damage was about $12 each."}
{"text":"AKA \"Burger King dim sum\" in virtue of the nearest major landmark :-)

As my friend's hardcore Hong Kong mama put it, \"It is Brilliant Chinese because it is where all the brilliant people go.\"  Well, I'm not sure if I detected an aura of brilliance about it.  The best I can say for it is that it was satisfying.  The har gow were nicely seasoned, the chow fun was firm but yielding, the beef/tofu thingy (not sure what it's called) had a nice texture, and the steamed bun wasn't dried out.  Nothing was disappointing, but nor was there anything exceptional going on.  Even though the dim sum in the city is uniformly worse, I'm still not sure I'd make the trek to go back."}

I did not even realized that there is The Brilliant Chinese Restaurant till the UYE posted and Toronto Star giving it some publicity. 

Since I cannot make the UYE because of work, and that dumpling sounded so good... I have to try it out!!

Egg-white wrapped seafood dumplings ($5)
- This need to pre order and there is a minimum order of 2
- You have a choice of seafood or vegetarian fillings... isn't that nice to all my vegetarian friends?!
- The wrapping itself is light, fluffy...and the fillings includes chopped shrimp, scallop, water chestnut, celery and king mushroom
- The taste is refreshing, not oily since it was steamed 
- When eating the dumplings, I feel like it is just like a parcel of goodness and yumminess!!!

Other dim sum we have were quite good too. 

I like that Steamed Beef and Bean Curd Skin in Layers ($3)
- A little twist to the steamed beef balls that is always a staple on most dim sum menu
- Don't have much beef inside but tons of bean curd and some water chestnut

The services here is attentive, the deco traditional but clean.

They do have specials if you paid before 11 AM is 20% off , 10% off after every weekdays."}
{"text":"I recently went dim sum at Brilliant Chinese Restaurant, near Market Village. No early bird dim sum on this occasion, so the atmosphere was a lot more relaxed and less rushed. 

Now onto the food:

Deep fried savoury dumpling had so little colour on them that I questioned whether they've been deep fried properly. Luckily, these tasted better than they looked.

Deep fried taro dumpling arrived cold at the table. We complained and they gave us a second batch, which was even colder than the first. In the end, we just cancelled our order and chose something else. At least the staff was pretty gracious about that.

My favourite dish of the day was the Korean style BBQ beef. I loved the bright and bold flavours, and the meat had just the right amount of fat. 

I generally stay away from Chiu Chow style steamed dumplings  because they usually contain celery, which I detest. These ones didn't have celery, so I actually liked them a lot. The peanuts provided a pleasant crunch. 

Steamed rice noodle roll with fried fritter dough was also pretty good, even though it wasn't an extremely refined version. 

Steamed sponge cake was super light and moist. It was the perfect antidote to all that deep fried food. 

But of course, we followed that light dish with deep fried sesame cake. I loved the chewy pastry shell!

I also ordered a beef chow fun to go for my boyfriend, and it was huge! This could easily feed 3-4 hungry people! For $8, it was definitely great value.

In summary, there were a couple of hits and misses with this restaurant, but I enjoyed my overall experience."}
