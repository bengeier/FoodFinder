{"text":"My daughter and I and a friend went to Celestin on a Buytopia $69 3 course meal on May 15, 2013.  I was excited because I have always wanted to try it..  We were greeted by the charming manager Geoff  Chen.  Never have I experienced better service.  We assumed at first he was the owner he was so attentive.  He treated every person in the restaurant as if they were the most important.  Yes the food was very good but the service was outstanding.  Would definitely go back for the wonderful service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious 2012. 

We called at 11am asking for a 12nn reservation for 12 and was asked if we could do 1215am. That was fine. Bit strange though coz when we got there, the restaurant was practically empty. 

In any case, we were seated promptly and the host and waiter were very attentive. Saw the comments here that they were being pushed to get drinks but we didnt feel pressured at all. 

Decor: Very elegant, white table linen, quiet elegance. We thought it would be a good place to take visitors to Toronto. 

Food: 
Me: Coffee (good), Sea bream tartar (good- tho hint of fishy taste), sirloin steak with fries (good but i asked for medium and it came out more cooked than I expected), choco mousse (very good)
Wife: Calamari salad (good), quiche (very good), beignet (very good - caramel sauce wasnt too sweet)


Price: For $20, thought this was a great deal. 

Service: pretty good, not snooty at all. Coffee and water service kept coming. - Our entrees did take 30-40mins to come out which I thought was too long considering it wasnt that busy.

Note: It's about a kilometer's walk fr the Eglinton subway station. Not a bad walk through quiet neighborhoods but it is a bit of a walk, esp on a hot day. 

Overall: Didnt give them 5 stars bec of the entree wait time, and the fact they automatically added 15% to the bill (always find this tacky). Still, cant wait to come back and try out the regular menu."}
{"text":"This review is based on a Winterlicious dinner I had on a Friday evening. 

It seemed like a quiet evening for the restaurant when we arrived for dinner. We were pretty late for our reservations but it wasn't a problem because the restaurant wasn't too busy at the time. 

I ordered: 
- pate en croute: pate was good but it came with a side of super sour pickled vegetables, which I didn't like
- braised beef ribs: Delicious! The meat was very tender and cooked perfectly. The parsnip puree and kale paired very well with the ribs. 
- chocolate hazelnut terrine: Rich and decadent, but not overly sweet, which I liked 

The food was overall excellent and the servers were very friendly and attentive, but the wait time for the food was way too long and unacceptable. We spent almost 2 hours at the restaurant and most of the time we were chatting while waiting for the food... We weren't in a hurry but I was annoyed that I had to wait so long to eat. I relayed my feelings to our server and he was sincerely apologetic about it."}
{"text":"If you're into \"Nouvelle Cuisine\" (tasty but very small portions) , you won't be disappointed.
Just one thing: There's is absolutely no air conditioning."}
{"text":"From the service to the ambiance this gem of a restaurant in the heart of Mount Pleasant Village is truly an amazing experience.  The chef really knows what he is doing here, and the staff are very well versed in both the food preparation to the vintages that are housed in this great restaurant.  If you are looking for that fine dining quality and experience to match, you should not let this opportunity pass you by.  Will definitely be back - DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Went there for their NYE dinner.. 1st course was really good.. foie gras and sweetbread were perfect..
As for the 2nd course we decided on the halibut wrapped in potatoes.. fish was overcooked.. but still flavorful.. 3rd course my guest had duck and squid dish and i ordered the venison.. my dish was incomplete.. menu stated a cherry spinach sauce which was nowhere to be seen on my plate..when i mentionned it to our waiter he assured me thats the way the dish is supposed to be.. plus the roast salsify were harsh.. on top on that we were there at 6pm and left at 9:10.. every dish took like 30-40 mins to be served in a restaurant serving 3 tables.. mine of 2 another of 2 and one family of 4.. another downside was the fact that our waiter tried to convince us that it takes longer than usual because that particular day everything was fresh?? And that I should understand as we were both french speaking- \"have some wine while waiting comme le fait nos amis français\"... will be going to other french cuisine restaurants..specially one on bayview/eglinton area is way better.. this one might be the last option for me.."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Celestin two years ago, I was beyond impressed. Great French cuisine, nice decor. It is quiet enough to talk, but not dead.

This time, however, I found that the server was too chipper and in your face, and didn't listen to our requests, but just blabbered on about whatever he wanted to. 
By the end of our stay, he completely lost interest in us and when he didn't get the tip he expected, became very negligent.

Crème Arlequin is a very tasty dessert, but avoid the crumbles in the ice cream. Both me and my mom almost choked on those."}
{"text":"Having grabbed an absolutely wonderful almond cream croissant one morning at Thobors next door (the affiliated-with-but no-longer-owned-by bakery) I penciled this in as a \"to try\" for dinner. 

Sadly, that experience was not nearly as impressive. 

First, yes, I know you have an \"award winning\" wine cellar (how could one forget with all the signs on the door and multiple mentions on the menu. Oh, and then there is the wine menu itself, roughly suitcase-sized)  and I'm sorry I won't be spending an exorbitant amount on a glass (or if I wanted to drain my savings, a bottle) but can you not take it so personally when I say no thanks/I don't drink?

The service was at first wonderful and attentive, but it took FOREVER for us to get our mains (literally, we almost hit the 40 minute mark from the time we ordered until our food arrived - and our waiter only came by once during that time to put a tea-light candle on our table, not even filling up our water in the process), 

The pan-seared daurade was good if a bit bland (not a real fan of the chive-mustard oil), but the fingerling potatoes were WAY too salty (and I love salt - I'm pretty sure I've never said something was too salty in my life). 

The atmosphere is great, and the patio is a gorgeous little space on the corner, but for the price we paid the portions were small, the food not that memorable and the service spotty at best. I'd consider coming back here for brunch (esp if they get their pastries from the aforementioned bakery) but it's not high on the list, for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious lunch with my boyfriend and it was pretty good.  we will be coming back for brunch! 

For appetizer, we ordered sea bream tartar and a chilled calamari salad.  Both were yummy!  Something I have never tried before but it was tasty.  

My boyfriend ordered the steak for entree and I ordered a spinach and red pepper quiche.  My boyfriend wanted to order rare for his steak since a lot of people say they tend to overcook.  Our waiter, however, recommended us to order medium rare so we said sure.  My boyfriend ended up loving the steak, it was tender and juicy.  My quiche was pretty good too, and the crust is phenomenon.  

Creme brulee and beignet for dessert.  Both were good but I was too full to finish them.  


The portion looked small, but we were plenty full at the end of the meal.  Also, we ordered a bottle of evian still water and it cost 7.50. I was kind of shocked, will probably ask for tap water next time!"}
{"text":"Saw the groupon deal and thought it seemed like a great opportunity to try out a new place.made online reservations for 6:30 dinnet on Saturday. Parked at back...which was convenient and nice. Got there 20 mins early. We were greeted with a smile and taken to our table. Very accomodating, didnt feel i wasnt being treated well because i had a coupon. Everyone...blonde lady(hostess?) waiter(cool moustache!!) very knowledgeable about all the dishes and the frenchman from the bar...who brought us our drinks and always made sure i had fresh ice and lemon for my sparkling mineral water was great! Wonderful cozy small intimate atomsphere. Clean...immaculate tables, cutlery,and washroom. 
Ok...my glass of white wine was amazing as was hubbys beer. I had french onipn soup..to die for. And hubby had salad...also delish. Main i had cassoulet that smelled and tasted like heaven. Hubby had steak and frites. Ordered medium rare...came out pretty rare....sent back and still looked pretty rare to me but hubby said it was ok. It tasted very good. Good portions as well. Definitely we will return...great find!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife this past weekend and the service was really amazing. The host was friendly and quite funny as well. The wait staff was also attentive always asking about our meals and drinks.

On to the food. We ordered the french onion soup and foie gras appetizers and they were both delicious, although tbh, I've never had a foie gras I didn't like.

For our mains we ordered the duck confit and steak frites. They were both good, but we enjoyed our appetizers more. Portions were very decent and by the end we were too full for dessert. 

We'll definitely come back. I heard they have prix fixed lunches as well."}
{"text":"Decided to try Celestin again because I liked its Winterlicious menu.  It had been years since my last meal at Celestin.  Back then it was a new Toronto \"hot spot\".  The staff had attitude. The food was okay but nothing special. The room wasn't comfortable.  What a difference a few years and a change in ownership have made.  The seating is more comfortable.   The atmosphere is warm.  The staff is very accommodating.  And the food is excellent.   We went with the Prix Fixe Winterlicious menu which was $35 for appetizer, main & dessert.  It was a real bargain.  For appetizers the escargots were tasty and cooked perfectly.  For mains we had the braised Lamb Shank and the braised Veal Cheek.  Both were excellent.  The Veal Cheek melted in your mouth.  A taste explosion.  For dessert we had creme brule and a dark chocolate mousse.  Fantastic.  We brought an older wine and paid $30 corkage.  I learned that they don't charge corkage on Tuesdays which I will keep in mind for future reference.  We definitely will be going back to Celestin in the not too distant future."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal and regular customer at Celestin for its brunch and used to like the place due to its food and ambiance. However, after I visited the restaurant earlier this month for its prefix lunch, I was certainly not pleased with their service and food, especially with their signature steak, which is acclaimed to be 35 day dry aging one, but was not even close to it. What a huge disappointment and unpleasant experience!

After hours of wait without proper explanation 'why', steak was served; however, it smelled quite funny. Maybe, 'funny' would not be the right word to describe it; even 'disgusting', either. It smells like the mixture of strong raw miso and feces; rather close to later. Could you imagine how I and my wife felt after 1st bite? Anyways, that being said, we had to ask our server, who wore glasses with spiky hair, about steak, wondering what's going on. He explained in arrogant manner that it was a \"35 days dry-aged steak\" Wow, are you fxxxing kidding me this smelly shit is made of the best quality meat? I'm complaining your signature dish because I'm newbie to steak? Seriously?!? Trust me I'm a steak lover and have been top notch steakhouses not only in Toronto, but other cities like Vegas and New York. Even those renowned steakhouses usually carry 28 day dry aged, as I know. 
(Correct me if I am wrong) Honestly, I presume that Celesine's steak might have been dry aged for 35 days without proper care and ventilation, which might cause rotting decay. I wish whoever runs this restaurant read my review and explain better, because I am truly disappointed. From time to time, even Michelin 3 star restaurants might not be able to meet their customer's high expectation bar. However, when that happens, restaurants are expected to take corrective action to please its customers, instead of scolding them with high pride. Again, I'd be the last person to be called as 'claimer'. Please forgive my excessive words I used, but there is no other way to express my irritation.

In fact, my brother and his wife have long been planning his daughter's first birthday party this summer at Celestin due to my recommendation (Of course! Definitely before this incident happens!), but I know it would not be EVER happening because they would be too embarrassed if their guests were served like me."}
{"text":"I have been here twice this week for winterlicious (once for lunch and once for dinner)

Lunch was ok except half my group ordered the Top sirloin steak, pomme frites and a red wine reduction and the steak was over cooked for everyone who ordered it.
Dinner was ok but nothing to brag about.

Service both times was absolutely horrible.  I was hoping the service would be better on my dinner visit but it actually was worst.  Waiting an hour for our table to be ready was a bit much.  Seated at 9pm when the reservation was for 8pm.  Others around me were also quite upset.  Also no real apology or acknowledgement was made at the fact my friends and I had to stand and wait for an hour.

Will never return or recommend to others."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews on here rate this restaurant quite low, so I felt the need to speak up given that I've been 5 times and plan on going back next week.

The restaurant feels intimate and romantic, and definitely french. We've ordered Stuffed Hen, Ricotta Ravioli, Seared Flounder, Appel Clafouti, Chocolate Mouse, etc. Everything was delicious. They've also got a great Sommelier. The wait-staff are also very friendly, and I believe there to practice their english - they have been french when I've been there. They also make a great cappuccino on the go! Ask to see their \"bank vault\" (it's a beautiful wine cellar), the place was a former historic bank.

Pro's
- Food is great! A lot of menu selection
- They are extremely accommodating for food allergies, and even if you wanted a special side. (one of our party members wanted pasta and they made it for her! with seafood!)
- great wine selection
- that apple clafouti is something awesome in your mouth
- the owner and staff are great to talk to
- The place is stunning! Used to be an old bank and now looks classic Parisian!

Con's
- Portions are a bit small, but I ordered a salad and the hen and I was SO FULL. so maybe they aren't small.

You will very much enjoy the restaurant. Can't wait to go back and bring my family!"}
{"text":"food was ok but not great and the staff was rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"The food was alright, we had the salmon and the duck, and shared the escagot appetizer- delicious but rather pricey. The duck dish had a huge portion and was done perfectly and the sausage was really delicious with a surprising hint of cloves - however, it was paired with beans which was rather heavy and dry and I felt that it needed to be paired with a chutney or something fruity/jus for more contrast. The salmon had a nice crisp to it with the fragrant saffron sauce. 

TERRIBLE SERVICE - Our server Amin was exceptionally fake and cheeky. He offered us wine but we told him water was fine and he totally gave us attitude and abruptly turned away with the menus like he was pissed. When we asked him for more water he wouldn't reply and when we said thank you he didn't reply as if he was reluctant and unhappy with getting us water. There was another waiter with a beard - super friendly and respectful guy- we asked him to refill the water and he replied with \"I would love to\" and when we said thank you he replied with \"you're very welcome\". Amin was also very rude when he took our check, he didn't even say thank you and probably was eyeing his tip thinking he didn't get enough. At the end he was super fake. Overall, he left a bad taste in our mouth and a bad impression of such a nice place. The entire night I had wish the bearded fellow had waited us - he was patient and sweet and sincere."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for my extended birthday celebrations to take out my best girl friends. This year, I didn't feel like hanging out in some downtown restaurant or club...I wanted something quiet, uptown, and French. Bonjour Celestin. 

Intro. It was a Friday night and I was the first patron of the evening. Someone came out to open the door and welcome me. I am already loving this place. I was seated near the back which enabled me the view of the entire restaurant. Quaint and small. I had read some reviews complaining of noise...I didn't think I needed to worry about that tonight.

Food. I really felt like duck so for appetizers I had the foie gras and for the main, the seared Margret duck. My 2 girl friends similarly had a craving for duck so they both had the same dishes. We were pleasantly surprised! The duck was extremely tender and the meat fell of the bone...heavennnn! I asked my girl friends their opinions of the duck and they both agreed it was divine. Celestin offers specials for the night so I hope to return and give it a try. Dessert on the other hand was disappointing. I didn't feel like something heavy (cake, pudding, etc...) so I opted for the petits four. Entirely forgettable. Myself and another girl friend ordered a B52 and it was extremely sweet - so sweet I could only have one sip. I would not consider their alcoholic coffee's a strong point. 

Service. Excellent. Water and wine glass always full and service never intrusive. 

Ambiance. Celestin has the air of an elegant french restaurant (white table cloths, lots of whites and blacks), decorated in the style Ina Garten would approve. It's not trendy or modern, classic at its best. 

I would definitely come here again. Because you have to make months reservations to go to Auberge, Celestin might be your next best bet for great French cuisine. It is a bit pricey, but, welcome to Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is known for their fabulous brunches!

A lovely french restaurant in every sense of the word. Beautifully decorated with tiled floors, taupe walls, and a simple clean decor. 

Servers that are a nice mix of formal while still loosening up enough to crack a joke or two and dressed in all black.

The menu is simple and elegant offering true french brunch cuisine.

The soup of the day was a lovely. Keep in mind the croissants they come around with are not free, though they serve it much like a pre-dinner roll from a basket and never mention a cost.

If you're in the market for a sophisticated brunch, this is the place. I will be back, without question."}
{"text":"Delicious summer lunch. 
I was pleasantly surprised with Celestin's lunch menu. I had chilled tomato and red pepper soup, which was simple and refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer day. For my main, I had Salad Nicoise. The tuna was perfectly done, just seared on the outside and very raw on the inside. Very good quality tuna as well, complimented with citrus dressing, green beans, tomatoes and boiled egg. The whole dish was nicely composed fresh, and very tasty. For desert I had chosen bread pudding with caramel ice cream. The bread pudding was laced with cacao and vanilla infused cream. Delicious finish to a lovely lunch. We will visit again!"}
{"text":"Nice location, the atmosphere is on point for the type of restaurant its not too over the top like some French restaurants I've been to. 

The service was great. our waiter was really friendly, very good sales person, made all of the dishes sound mouth watering. The waiter was so good he got one of our friends, who had eaten before coming, to get a main dish instead of an appetizer.

BUT down to the important stuff...the food. Its presentation was nice. The dishes ordered were the duck confit, the lamb shank, steak and a seafood dish.   The duck came with a lovely piece of pork belly which was delicious and cooked perfectly, the duck was tender fall off the bone tender and flavorful. The lamb shank was tender BUT very fatty and not too flavorful I prefer Persian lamb mmmmm. Two steaks were ordered- one was medium rare and the other medium well, the medium well was more like a well done and a little too hard. Overall the food was okay, nothing too special. Oh! And before I forget, the portions were definitely NOT enough! We're all probably going to grab a bite after walking out.....

All in all- service was great, food wasn't anything special, portions were tiny and definitely NOT worth its price tag.

FYI the three stars are from the awesome service."}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss. They change the me u frequently. So I have been here 4 times over a years time. First time was bled, nothing special. Sickbed time was amazing (lentils with salmon, delicious! V memorable). And the other two times were ok. So check the menu before u go!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had one of those wagjag vouchers for a prefix, 3 course meal (a great deal at $35/person). We both loved the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant. We both had the steak entree - it was cooked to order, and very flavourful. My appetizer was amazing! I had the mushroom tart with arugula.  I also loved the dessert which was a plate of petit fours. All of them were delicate and delicious. I would love to come to this restaurant again to try the full menu."}
{"text":"I was here today - a brunch birthday party for 14. We were placed at a large table in the front room, which was great. I know a group of 14 is tough to wrangle, so I won't dwell on the waiter service we received. I'll simply note it: the service was somewhat weird.

I thought the name, decor and menu at Celestin indicated that it was a true French-style cafe. However, when I ordered chocolat to drink (a bowl of hot chocolate that is typically served for breakfast in France), the waiter was very perplexed indeed. Eventually, I was presented with an espresso cup of hot chocolate. Not French style at all!

The bread slices, softened butter and jams were lovely to snack on while we perused the menu. Most of the guests in the group ordered a quiche with side salad. I didn't get a try, but I'm told the quiches were tasty even though they looked kind of tough and cold on the plate. The croque-monsieur looked good to me: lots of cheese.

I had the dungeness crab soup, which was crabby and mildly spicy - pretty enjoyable. I also had a side of frites and aioli. Perhaps I happened to be given the dregs of a fry-basket batch, but my entire bowl of frites consisted of broken-up end bits, no full-size fries. And, these scraps of frites were served with less than half a tablespoon of aioli. Yeah, you wouldn't want to waste any mayo on someone who actually ordered it, would you? That's $5 for broken fry fragments and a thimble of posh mayonnaise.

I guess the thing to point out here is that among the 14 of us dining today, nobody really mentioned the food during the meal. It just wasn't memorable."}
{"text":"Food was less than mediocre and the service is terrible. There was literally two tables in the patio including ours and no one in the dining room. It still took over 15 minutes to order our drinks and almost 45 minutes to get our food.

I eventually ordered the croissant benedict with side salad and the iced cappuccino. By the time I got my iced cappuccino, the ice had all melted and diluted it - it was terrible. I expected more for something that cost $4. Salad was way over dressed and was barely edible - I did not eat any after the first taste. The hollandaise sauce was too salty and did not work with the croissant. It just made it too buttery. I could've had just ate a stick of butter, which I wouldn't have mind because I know it's just butter. For a classy looking place, I would have expected better food and service.

I've been here once before and was not impressed then either. I had recently took some cooking courses and my french cooking was better than this - I should've just ate at home. This place is just an overly priced \"so called\" french restaurant that I will never go again on my own decision. Overall, terribly disappointed again. I would just stick with the bakery, which I hear is not part of the restaurant anymore. Figures."}
{"text":"2-1/2 stars

I've been to Céléstin on 3 occasions now.  The first being Summerlicious ($35 pp) and the subsequent 2 for dinner.

SUMMERLICIOUS:  18% automatic gratuity?  This to me just screams \"We think  you're too cheap to tip.\"  Not good in my books.  And whenever a restaurant tacks on automatic gratuity, I won't pay a cent more.  If you had left it up to my devices, I might've even been more generous.  Server asked us if we wanted coffee AFTER we had finished our dessert?  

DINNER:  I think that the serving staff here are very inexperienced.  They are not observant, and everything goes at a snail's pace.  The food is so-so, and depends heavily on menu selection.  The Bavette au Boeuf was lacking in any flavour though the potatoes were divine, buttery goodness.  The Lamb Shank, again, bland, and not very flavourful though the \"pancake\" they had underneath it was unique and yummy.  I will say that they do a mean Chicken Liver Parfait here - not one bit grainy and probably one of the smoothest I've tried.  5 stars just for that appetizer.  The Duck Confit is tender, but not the most flavourful, and the lentils du puy are just boring.  The Loup de Mer Crudo (European Bass Sashimi) is quite refreshing and flavourful.

Desserts are probably what I remember most about my dining experience at Céléstin.  From the Chocolate Lava Cake (perfectly spongey, warm, and gooey, although one-dimensional on flavour), to the Passion Fruit Pot de Crème (creamy yet light) to the Apple Tart Tatin (with hints of citrus peel and a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream)... I enjoyed all of them.

V E R D I C T

This is what I would call a traditional French restaurant.  If you're lucky, the bartender/general manager will serve you and he is what I would call an experienced server.  The girls working the restaurant are prone to messing up your orders, messing up your bills, and forgetting to ring an order in which leaves you waiting around and halfway through dessert your coffee makes an appearance.  I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"This place is delightful!

It's a perfect romantic date night venue, however, I treated a friend to birthday lunch here and we enjoyed their excellent service and charm in the day time instead.

We ordered from the $23 Summerlicious menu. I had the ceviche, skirt steak, and isle fondant with anglais (meringue and cream anglaise). My friend had duck rilette salad, rainbow trout and cream brûlée.

Everything was delicious but we decided we liked the ceviche over the duck rilette and the rainbow trout over the skirt steak. The brûlée was definitely better than the meringue, but the meringue was pretty good too.

Everything was presented beautifully. Only we are greedy little piggies and took no photos. Hehehe. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I visited here for a friend's kid's 1 year birthday party. Out of prefix menu choices, I had the calamari salad, red wine reduction steak and crème brûlée. Firstly, I'm not sure what the issue was but the service was very slow, although the servers themselves were friendly enough. Calamari salad was decent but the steak was quite terrible. It had this fishy taste to it, as if either the steak was sitting in some sort of fishy liquid or as if they put in some fish sauce. It had a very pungent fragrance and fishy flavour. I'm not sure if this is on their regular menu but if it is, then I highly recommend that you DON'T get it.
My crème brûlée was pretty good but for others who had the same thing at my table, it came out too watery. 
I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I had a pretty bad experience here about a year ago. I didn't really use my Yelp to write reviews back then so this is a bit delayed. I came here for a birthday and was notified that there would be a $28(??) cake cutting fee. When I arrived my friends were saying how the waiter was quite unfriendly and it took a loooong time for my water to even come. My main course was alright at best and the dessert was terrible imo. It was a pistachio pudding thing, and I couldn't eat it after one bite. Overall a disappointing experience, there are much better food options for the price."}
{"text":"Have been driving past Celestin for many years, but have never been inside to dine. A pal wanted to check this place out so we decided to take advantage of their Winterlicious Menu. The decor inside is quite nice and simple - it's all navy and white. It's not a big place so I would highly recommend for you to make reservations.

I ordered the following to make my Winterlicious Lunch Set:
1. Eggplant and Portobello Mushroom Tart and Balsamic Dressing
2. Roast Red Pepper, Goat Cheese and Chicken Quiche Served with Mesclun Lettuce and Citrus Vinaigrette
3. Chocolate Ganache Tart and Confit Ginger Ice Cream

The food was a-ok; nothing to write home about, but also not terrible. Portion sizes are good and there's a good variety of items on their menu that anyone can dine here. Service was also a-ok."}
{"text":"This review is for their brunch menu, which is fan-frigging-tastic. The way-too-chipper for 9am server/hostess was sweet and very French and very quick with the coffee (merci boucoup) and croissants. The croissants, by the way, were LEGENDARY. All flaky and buttery and sent down from heaven by angels themselves. Seriously. The croissant was so good, I moved on to the Croissant Benedict for the main attraction, which was also delicious. It's not the best benedict in town, but it's got a decent hollandaise and the eggs were perfectly oozy. What else can I say? One of the best breakfasts I've had so far in Toronto. I can't wait to come back to try their dinner."}
{"text":"The two stars are only for the food. The service here has made me livid. Firstly, we waited for an hour before our first course. 40 minutes until our second. Then the waiter seeig that I am visibly displeased tells my girlfriend next time she comes dont bring me. He just cut his tip in half. I understand French humor but it usually comes with a side of French service. Never coming again."}
{"text":"We had a good rabbit ravioli here over a year ago for dinner. I don't see it on their current menu... hope they bring it back.

From my notes on opentable, I wrote \"The waiters/waitresses did not make good suggestions on the food though... I feel like sometimes they're just trying to get us to spend more.\" Sorta left us with a bad feeling, but meh."}
{"text":"I challenge you to tell me what is better than a melt-in-your-mouth chocolate croissant & a cup of bold coffee on a Sunday morning? I dare say Nothing! Celestine is as close to Paris as you'll find in Toronto. As a summer, weekend ritual, my husband and I would walk over to Celestine's take-out counter and indulge! Warm gooey chocolate wrapped in fresh pastry... honestly... need I say more?"}
{"text":"The old Chef Pascal in my opinion had a way better menu to offer. I miss the Rabbit Ravioli which was one of his specialties and I still dream about it! It's too bad but still not a bad place; just not the same any more without Pascal's touch!"}
{"text":"Not impressed for me.
one thing i like was their fig bread (looks like pizza)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying...I love french food.
3 of dined here tonight for summerlicious.  One of our DC's was a little late, so they ran out of hen stuffed with something and fois gras.  That aside, dinner was tasty.

Two of us ordered the scallop ceviche (yummy), but even more yummy was my friend's order of tempura eggplant (not what you would expect at all, but definitely super delish, my DC was kind enough to offer a taste).

Having run out of stuffed hen, 2 of us went with the white fish (dourade, or something), delicious, light textured, a light flavour, with a delectable cream sauce on a buttery gnocchi concoction with peas.  My DC made the better choice of 2 types of pork (pork belly and a pork chop - OMG I could have devoured her entire plate).

For dessert, chocolate mousse was ordered - yummy, the beignets (the best option), and the cucumber sweet soup - this was actually tasty, light and refreshing, but it's no chocolate mousse.  We didn't try the last dessert.

If I were to do it all again, I'd do the eggplant tempura, the pork dish, and the beignets...

Happy dining!"}
{"text":"Food was GREAT! If this review was all about food, it would be 5 star BUT during my experience here I have to downgrade to a 3 star.

This is because of the poor, poor service my partner and I received during a visit to Celestin. First! We were told we were getting bread while waiting for our starter but by the time the bread arrived...so did our starter. No complaints here about the food, it was fantastic. 

Onto the main course....not exaggerating....we waited 45 minutes, maybe more, for our main course to arrive. This was torture! For such a 'professional' restaurant to leave us waiting for that long is simply appalling. Finally! our mains arrived and again, no complaints, rather, my partner received a handsomely large serving of the lamb dish. We were so bored though of being in the restaurant, due to our horribly long wait for the mains, that we quickly ate and asked for the bill. As mentioned, my partner had a large lamb meal so he asked for it to be wrapped up. We paid our bill and the waitress returned with his wrapped up meal...not in a bag, not in a box...but wrapped up in aluminium foil.....we wont be going back here."}
{"text":"We had an incredible meal and the service was top notch. This place is beautiful!!!

Between us all we had ceviche, foie gras, beet salad, quiche, sea bream, steak, frites and creme brûlée. Everything was great!!!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"An amazing french restaurant.  A great variety of food - needed the waiter to explain a lot of the selections- so a bit different but absolutely amazing.  The duck confit - the best I can recall ever having.  Literally melted in my mouth.  Exception wine list.  Met the couple at the next table - a little difficult to have an intimate conversation.

Centrally located, easy on street parking.  Great service.  Well worth the trip"}
{"text":"I bought a $39 for $70 Groupon voucher and called to make a reservation 4 days before it expired. The lovely lady apologetically told me they were all booked but took my number to see what she could do. She called me back the next day and extended the promo by a week!

I went there with a friend and we were both blown away by the service. We ordered a very flavourful lentil salad and a salads du jour to start  (that really was not worth the $12). We were very happy with the mains- duck confit and braised rabbit, their creme brûlée though,  definitely made this meal even more memorable!"}
{"text":"I came her for Summerlicious last night for an early dinner and enjoyed the overall experience. Service was excellent, although they definitely like to encourage wine consumption. 

I wasn't famished when I arrived, which was probably for the best because the tiny portions here are not very filling. Still, getting stuffed isn't my goal and I favour flavour over quantity.

I ordered the following:

Baby Scallop Ceviche, Mint, Grapefruit and Chilies - this was pretty good, but there was something a bit odd about the scallop texture. Maybe they were boiled very briefly? 

Seared Top Sirloin Steak with Comfit Shallots, Pomme Gâteux and Sauce Foyot - the steak as very tough to cut through, and it's a good thing I ordered it rare because it was still more on the medium side. 

My DC ordered the Roast Daurade with Parisian Gnocchi, Peas, Oranges and Espelette Pepper Beurre Blanc and hers was phenomenal - literally \"melt in your mouth\" texture.

Passion fruit Pot au Crème - definitely the highlight of the meal. As Jean K. Jean would say on SNL: Incroyable!"}
{"text":"For brunch, a bit stiff and portions too small. Mushroom omelette delicious. Coffee very smooth."}
{"text":"We had a wagjag voucher for a prefix, 4 course meal $35 each great deal. We live in the area and had never been and thought we'd try it.  We started with a lobster bite size sort of thing and it was tasty and we were enjoying the atmosphere.  Then we waited an hour for our appetizers and our mains came out!! not cool.  They blamed the kitchen and their apparent machine was not working properly. So they comped a beer.

Appetizers and then dinner came out both good. We had several servers 3 and a host so not really sure who our server was but they were all good at apologizing.

BUT the highlight was when the bill came, we ordered a $50 bottle of red wine, on the menu it said 2006 when it came it was a 2008 they had an excuse for that we discussed at the beginning  then the bill reads $55!! 

I advised 1 of the servers and she brought the menu and agreed its $50 and then said I guess the machine is wrong...um EXCUSE me?? your menu prices and machine should match....she went on to say its a good thing we checked our bill not everyone does, that made me laugh, I'm thinking YOU hope people don't remember that is how you rip people off!! Again the machine was blamed and they came back with a $5 discount off the bill lol not the correct bottle revised.....what a joke.

We will NOT be back and if you decide to go....CHECK YOUR BILL!!!"}
{"text":"Food: The menu is diverse and well prepared dishes with great wine and drinks pairing. We decided to go with an app, an entree, and dessert and the dishes surprised us, they exceeded our expectations of high quality. Service: The wait staff were very attentive and accommodating, given we had to bring our son. Our server was attentive to our needs, and was engaged without being too involved in our dining experience. I was impressed by the service from everyone this evening! A great experience, but be prepared to empty out your wallet, because this place isn't cheap."}
{"text":"YES to the cakes. 
Yes to the pastries.
Yes to the croissants."}
{"text":"Ah brunch!  A favourite with my wife particularly.  Six of us had a delightful time at Celestin yesterday.  There's an overall French feel to the place.  Great table.  Very good service.  Wonderful croissants.  Properly cooked omelettes, i.e., runny.  (The best omelettes used to be at Didier.)  Celestin has been added to our brunch list."}
{"text":"I went to Celestin on January 19th, 2014  with my siblings for dinner and we ordered:
-Beet Salad with Apples, a Dried Apple Vinaigrette, Friséeand Radish
-Beet Ravioli appetizer
-Wild Mushroom Parpadelle with Truffle and Zamarano Cheese.
-Steak Frites with Garlic Butter.
-Bouillabaisse with Seabream, Scallops and Red Snapper
-Side of Gnocchi

Overall the food was good, but we found it really salty for our taste.  I have not had gnocchi as good as the one at Celestin though!!  Cut out the salt and the little puffs are the most delicious things I've ever had!  The beet salad was tiny, even for fancy restaurant standards, in my opinion.

The service was great and our server was wonderful (younger lady).  They do winterlicious here too."}
{"text":"Winterlicious Dinner ($35) experience was A-OK.

Food is good but portions are small..... 

It was definitely NOT a good sight when your dinner mate kept looking at you with hungry eyes... lusting after more food...

We ordered:

Crab soup and lemon crème fraiche - smell good, taste good, but not enough
Charcuterie plate - meh.......

Braised New Zealand lamb shank, wild mushroom ragout and a thyme socca - fall off the bone tenderness
Sea bream Provencal with a bouillabaisse sauce - No sauce will able to make the overcooked fish taste better... and bouillabaisse sauce has no taste at all just the orange colour

Traditional crème brulée - smooth, with excellent vanilla flavour
Moelleux with vanilla ice cream - Warm Chocolate Cake and Ice cream.. awesome!!

The \"Ain't Misbehaving\" ($14) Cocktail I tried here is so so so GOOD!!! Well balanced with just a touch of spiciness... I think it is way better than the food I ate here! 

15% Auto Tip added during the Winterlcious... but the service here is top notch.

I think my dinner mate can eat 3 of the Winterlicious portions and still hungry.... so if you are looking for value, you won't find it here. However, it was a nice romantic place for an intimate dinner experience."}
{"text":"Two friends (first-timers here) and I booked a table online to try their Winterlicious menu. Good food was overshadowed by very questionable service.

The most serious issue was a major billing error. We three friends asked for the bill to be split 3 ways, and we paid by credit card. We were just about to leave the restaurant when I re-checked my bill. It seemed a little high for lunch, even with wine. I thought maybe I had double-tipped, but it was still much too high. When I compared bills, I realized each of our 3 bills represented half the total, rather than a third. With tip, this amounts to a $75 collective discrepancy that we almost missed. Our original bills were voided, and we were charged the correct amounts - all OK in the end on that front.

Smaller issues:
1) Received the wrong entrees - there was a mix-up of tables at pick-up.
2) Surcharge for croissants, which I had assumed was bread service. Delicious, but not worth the surprise $10. Such charges are the norm in Europe, but not here.
3) Service by committee - 3 different servers. Our original server later left work (fine, these things happen), but no one informed us that he had left.
4) The replacement waiter who screwed up the bills is actually a co-owner. He replied to my e-mail very promptly. But whether via e-mail or in person, he offered little more than a well-meaning apology. I have to wonder how innocent and exceptional these billing errors are.

Food was good:
1) Appetizers: The beet and goat cheese salad is a far better choice than the bland, boring mussels.
2) Mains: Roast hen is generous portion, a little salty. Stuffed sea bass is petite, seafood filling has meatball-like consistency. Nice side dishes.
3) Desserts: Pleasant flourless chocolate cake w/ caramel ice cream, crème brulée.
4) Croissants: Buttery, flaky, excellent.

All in all, we have given up on Celestin. You can accept multiple service issues at a noodle bar, but not at a French fine dining restaurant. There are plenty of alternatives in the neighborhood for a nice meal."}
{"text":"If you are thinking of buying a deal voucher for this restaurant, THINK TWICE!!! I do not normally write reviews, but this restaurant is terrible. They have a separate menu for those who had deal vouchers and they had to substitute EVERYTHING. Service was terrible and slow that we left at 10 pm with no dessert. The waiter brought us our bill and did not even offer us dessert. Definitely will not be going back to this place."}
