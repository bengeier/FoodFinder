{"text":"This is our GO TO PLACE for Al Pastor Taco's.  They also have some amazing Chicharrones..  Incredible.  We drive from Summerlin to this place just for the authentic taste."}
{"text":"When I was a kid in Houston,TX there was this glorious bakery called La Victoria that made the most delicious mexican pastries. I have not found a place i love that much since La Reina. My mom and dad came to town and I told them we should give La Reina a shot, since we have come up with dead ends at all other panderia's we have been to in the southwest. I could not be happier! I really wish they made the gingerbread piggies, and sweet potato empanadas, but maybe they do and they weren't made the day my parents went. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"DONT EAT HERE EVER!!!! ITS DISGUSTING!! We came in and asked for a taco bowl AND THE CHEF ASKED US WHAT IS INSIDE!!! she said \"um have you had it before? do you know what's inside?can you tell me?\" MY DAD HAD TO TELL HER HOW TO MAKE THE FOOD . my sister had a taco and the Carne asada was SPOILED!! SHE NEARLY THRU UP!!! everything had a lot of lime (trying to reduce the taste of spoiled meat) the onions were spoiled with a lot of lime and the guacamole WAS BLACK this is poor service and there should be an inspection at this restaurant they can get people sick!!!!"}
{"text":"Great homemade Mexican food and pastries. Prices are very reasonable as are the portions. Don't expect a flashy place, this is an authentic taco shop (yes, they have tripa, cabeza, buche, and lengua).

Basically everything is priced from $3.99 for carne asada, carnitas, or pollo to $5.99 for shrimp. They can also make veggie burritos, however my guess is the beans and tortillas have lard in them. They sell rotisserie chickens for $4.99 and you can add rice, beans, and tortillas for $4 more. Salsa bar available and they take credit cards too. As for desserts, they have lots to chose from, ranging anywhere for .25 cents for a pastry to $1.99 for a slice of tres leches cake."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff.  The quantity you get is a good value.  As for taste, its not really blowing me away.  Just ok, but good for a quick dinner."}
{"text":"I walked in and walked right out.  It was so dirty,  the floors the counters the stove top where food was cooking,  everything was filthy.   The buffet where food was displayed was disgusting.  I could not stick around, no way."}
{"text":"Try the chicken tamales and burritos they are great.  Everything is made fresh.... hidden gem!"}
{"text":"we went here on 4th of July morning looking for menudo to help a friends hangover, it looks alittle sketchy but oh well, figured we'd try it.  First...I don't speak Spanish and they speak very little English, thank goodness for for the one other person in there who ordered for us.  My friend got the menudo and I decided on this chicharone dish with some kind of green sauce.  I would've just drank that green sauce...it was sooo yummy.  My friend said the menudo was on point, def. helped his ails.  I managed to talk to one of the workers and she told me how the green sauce was made...I told her I would love to purchase just some of the sauce and she just GAVE me a nice sized portion of the sauce to take home, which I have put on just about everything..lol.
Very nice place and lovely employees, we will be back for sure to try other menu items."}
{"text":"This place use to have really good food in 2011/2012. The quality of food is horrible. I purchased tamales several weeks back they w
ere served cold to me. After I paid she said they would be cold and their microwave was not working. So go home and cook them there. I was really craving tamales so I said it was fine. I asked if they were any good. She said yes, the best. The best tasted the burnt plastic. It was the worst tamales I've ever had. She said they were just made the day before but I feel they were old tamales, old and burnt. The people are nice but Im afraid their food is not. Your better off finding another place to eat when your craving food."}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading the other reviews. It is a hole in the wall and the staff doesn't really speak much English but it was worth it. The food was good, the portion sizes were generous, and it was well priced.
They have baked good which were also well priced and (what I tried) delicious."}
{"text":"so I went here earlier today and I just loved the food. it really tastes like my grandmother made it. my one complaint would be that the soda machine is broken and only spat out that gross soda water.  how are you gonna have great Mexican food and not wash it down with a nice cold soda? so there ya go. do I recommend this place? hell yes but go and pick up a drink before."}
{"text":"GOOD: You can buy Mexican sweet bread till closing time if they are not sold out. That is not all they sell. Tenían lo que parecía gelatina, flan, y arroz con leche. The prices are economical and the menu is extensive. Beef, pork, chicken & sea food. Tacos, tostadas, burritos, tortas, enchiladas, chiles rellenos y caldos. 

BAD: 20 minutes before closing they turn off the burners and fryers. I went on Sunday night, the red blinking \"OPEN\" sign was on but no food could be cooked for me. The salsa station was a horrible mess with spoiled cucumbers. The lady was mopping and was not friendly at all. 

UGLY: the grocery store odor was of rotting potatoes & meat. It smelled extra fishy too. I have been to other grocery stores where they sell fish & shrimp as well, but the smell here is scary. The workers smoke outside in front of the door and they are scary unfriendly. Made me feel like I was going to get mugged. 

I'm very disappointed. I don't think I'm going back there again. I didn't get to taste the food. I went to Cardenas and got a huge pre made chicken salad for $3.99."}
