{"text":"Great breakfast served here, bottomless cup of coffee. Service is excellent and professional. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times, but this is the last time.  The order was made with pork instead of turkey after making the omelet three times. They lied about it and refused to own up to it."}
{"text":"Delicious food but very noisy because of a private party.
Service was spotty. Waited a long time for coffee refills.
Great home fries and peameal bacon."}
{"text":"The place was cold. The home fries were half cooked/half raw potatoes. The sausages were mushy. Food is also over priced. Best part of my breakfast was the toast."}
{"text":"Was excited to try the restaurant after reading the positive reviews.  Always a fan of a good ol' family restaurant.

Went for brunch on a Sunday and the restaurant was understaffed.  Took about 5 minutes to get seated despite numerous open tables.  There was no clear host or hostess and all the waiters and waitresses were running around moody and stressed.

Took a good 30 minutes to wave down a waitress and place our orders.  Everyone was walking around with their head down to avoid serving tables.

Food was good but was not anywhere good enough to make up for waiting 45 minutes for eggs and bacon.  My girlfriend had the sausage and goat cheese omelette which was good.  The goat cheese was fresh and the serving was generous.  I had the big breakfast meal (bacon, sausage, peameal bacon, eggs) which was solid.  

Would like to come back and try their lunch and dinner, but only after memories of this unfortunate experience wears off."}
{"text":"Visited Steve's on a Saturday morning. Place was busy but we got our table for two without any wait. If I were to give a rating based on the other tables of fellow diners with their beastly children, and the noise they brought with them, I'd give it zero stars. Thankfully, once they were gone it was a pleasant dining experience. The food was excellent as was the service. Ordered the spinach and feta omelette (a little skimpy on the feta but I'll let it go), best homefries I've had in the GTA so far. Also, had corned beef hash with (choice of) eggs, everything done well though hash could have had a bit more crisp (personal preference.) Haven't found hash anywhere else! All staff was very personable. Very reasonable prices, don't need to eat lunch after breakfast at Steve's. Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"Usually go to a different chain breakfast place, but we were in this area and really hungry so we decided to try it out. I now know that we should stick to our regular place and won't have a need to come here again. Steve's will probably suit most people as the prices aren't too bad and the food tastes alright, but if you have any dietary concerns at all, don't bother.

Pros:
- Standard prices
- Lots of seating
- Parking lot
- Service was ok

Cons:
- Service was ok, not really welcoming but also not mean
- Will not substitute anything if you have a dietary concern - other breakfast places will give me a few more hashbrowns since I can't have toast, this was an absolute no here
- So, since they wouldn't substitute a few more hashbrowns, I over-paid for 2 fried eggs, 2 lame pieces of bacon, and a couple potatos (I honestly should have taken a picture of this meal)"}
{"text":"I've been on a mission to find the best eggs benedict for Sunday brunch, outside of downtown Toronto. Steve's comes close.

As other reviewers have noted, it was noisy - but I didn't find it excessive. The decor was much more upscale than I expected. Comfortably modern and clean. (I expected greasy spoon.) Servers were busy, but quite competent and pleasant. Substitutions were made with no problem. We didn't feel pressured to leave once our plates were removed.

Easy to get to, and lots of parking.

Most important to me, the eggs came with a runny yolk, the hollandaise sauce (although probably not homemade) had the requisite tang, and they were served on toasted english muffins. All good. I didn't think to sub out the ubiquitous home fries for fruit, but I will next time.

If the powers-that-be are reading, I would have given it 4 stars if the ham was real Black Forest or Westphalian, and the eggs had a little garnish - like black olive slices or even some parsley.

Next time I'm in the neighbourhood, I'd definitely return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"A bunch of friends and I came in on a Saturday morning for brunch; we were actually VERY lucky to beat the rush!

I ordered the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benny, while others had the Philly Cheesesteak, Giant Chocolate Chip Pancakes and...other delicious-looking meals.

Restaurant size: 
It's a fair-sized place, with adequate spacing between tables. However, because it's such a popular place it can fill up very fast.

Portion size:
Very nice! Finish all those home fries and you're set for until the next major meal...

Service:
Courteous, available and helpful. We crack jokes a lot, so we had a nice time interacting with the staff."}
{"text":"We were always curious to try out this place, so we finally stopped by as our usual breakfast place was closed, we ordered their mixed berries crepe which was cold and stale and the egg Benedict was mediocre at best, the English muffin was soggy and soaked and the eggs were covered with cold sauce.

Their Homestyle fries were also cold and seemed  like cooked a long time ago and microwaved again, I also noticed other guests leaving their home fries untouched

Not recommended at all for breakfast"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dinning at Steve's recently. Ordered the beef dip which came with French fries and coleslaw.  My sandwich was full of meat and delicious, however the dip was just ok.  Generous portion of fantastic fries!  And in the end I was given a take away box and small gravy container to take home my leftovers.  Waiter was awesome! Completely awesome! Will definitely return hopefully many more times and will be recommending to everyone :)"}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast, the food was ok, the atmosphere  was not, the noise level made the whole experience just plain bad.. even the manager was screaming. 
Our server happened to be a nice guy who tried his best, but this was not enough to make us go back., there are quite a few better options in the area."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place for a diner. Everything is well priced, the service is okay (I had to ask twice for hot sauce and the server kept asking if I wanted more coffee even though I said no). The grand slam was good although it's weird that they're so iffy with substitutes. Overall, it's a cute place and I wouldn't mind trying their lunch or dinner specials. I'd seriously recommend they put pie on the menu though, I like pie after breakfast."}
{"text":"Looking to capitalize on the longevity and popularity of their original location, Stevie's north doesn't stray far from Bathurst St. Unfortunately, the new location lacks the charm and coziness of the original, and it's cheap decor and budget oriented renovations will not work surrounded by much newer and fresher options. Banking on name recognition alone won't be enough for Steve's north. 
The eggs Benedict were simple even though the hollandaise sauce is quite obviously from a powder. 
I'm happy to keep the original location still exists!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great variety, fabulous staff and atmosphere. Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Amazing omelette with Italian Sausage and goat cheese, though the egg was a little overdone. Excellent service and care, and fast service. Well kept and clean location with a casual vibe. Would definitely go back - prime location for brunch/breakfast."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to try this place for lunch. Of course, I had to order the Eggs Benedict, and see what all the fuss was about.

Food was delicious. Home fries were not too greasy, the eggs benny was spot on, very nice hollandaise sauce, not too watery and not too thick, just right. The waitress gave me an option of how well done I wanted my poached eggs! I never had the option before at any other place, so it was a nice surprise. The meal also came with a tea or coffee, which is also a nice surprise.

Staff are friendly, and the place was 75% filled with diners during the late lunch hour when I arrived. I often drive by this place and assumed it was a quiet joint with no diners, but I was wrong. 

I will definitely be coming back to try out some of the other fair. Well done, Steve."}
{"text":"Straight up, y'all are straight up CRAY, if you don't agree that this is best Eggs Benny around. I can understand my 5 star might be excessive to some, but 3 star or less? That's just not plausible.

How can I be this confident? Easy, allow me to enlighten you to the Eatcrest Benny rating scale (it's a science). Based on the following criteria: Hollandaise (taste/texture), Egg Consistency, quality/cook/thickness of pemale bacon included, toast on the English muffin

*Hollandaise* - thick, creamy, slight tang of citrus (not enough to be overwhelming, enough to be delightful), lightly garnished with chopped greens

*Egg* - perfectly cooked to specifications, zero extra water or moisture, great shape and perfect level of runny egg

*Meat* - Easily the most perfect cut of peamale I've had the pleasure of eating. Not a skimpy scrap, and not a steak cut, the perfect quantity relative to the rest of the plate. Cooked also perfectly, no excess char but cooked hot through

*Toast* - lightly buttered, cooked medium, light browning but soft once cut.

So far Steve's (which is located south of hwy 7 on Yonge, just inside of Thornhill/Vaughan) is batting 1000 on food, so what's left? Staff, service, location, and extras.

Staff, incredibly friendly, 2 servers looking after the entire place and not one cup of coffee has gone cold. Service, expert in my opinion, I asked what the recco of my server would be :Classic Benny OR Salmon Benny - she said \"without a doubt classic\". The location itself is likely one of the classiest, cleanest and nicest places to consider itself a diner.

And lastly... the added bonus? Free Wifi, I'm writing this review at my table while using said WiFi as we speak. 

I'll be back time and again for this Benny when in town, but I'm also excited to try their long list of Omlets

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"This place is great! 

First time we came here, I got the eggs benny with a strawberry banana smoothy. It was delicious. 

Since then, we decided to come back. This time trying the grand slam breakfast. 

The grand slam was great as well. A lot of food for one plate. (Came with 2 eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, toast and a pancake). 

All of the food was great. The pancake in my opinion was a little too fluffy and bready. 

Our sever did a fantastic job to make sure everyone was happy and was super quick despite the place being busy on a Saturday morning. She was on top of everything! 

I would definitely come back to try more dishes here."}
{"text":"I have heard several good things about this place, specifically the eggs benedict. It was absolutely phenomenal. The hollandaise sauce was fabulous. My husband ordered the spinach omelet and he loved it! The prices are fair, and the service is fast and delightful. The atmosphere was nice as well. It was nice to get seated quickly in such a busy place. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and will be retuning myself!"}
{"text":"Its clean and the furniture is nice and new but the food is really lacking for the prices charged.

Firstly their fries have to be the lowest possible quality, (im talking not even worth putting on the plate) and the homefries are always undercooked and bland.

But meanwhile they make a really tasty/fluffy omelette. The contrast is huge (half the meal is great, the other half I want to dump on the floor).

The pancakes were undercooked and gross. 
Sauseges were dried out and almost inedible
Bacon is simply the worst i've ever had. 

Their peameal bacon is 10/10 thick cut and juicy. 

I had a western sandwich for 10$ with fries once. it was ok but Wimpys sells the same for 7$ across the street and its much better.

Their BigMans breakfast is upwards of 14$ and it only has 2 eggs, thats a joke I eat 4 eggs easily.    Great location and like I said its clean and the omelettes are good. thats all.

people tell me Wimpys is gross and they won't eat there but I think the food is much better."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and was really impressed. The service was quick and they had options for people with food intolerances. 

At Steve's, they had gluten free bread and home fries. This is really rare for a restaurant because most restaurants throw their fries into a fryer where they insert other items with gluten. I was really excited to order eggs, enjoy a piece of gluten free bread, home fries and bacon. 

All over, I would definitely return to Steve's restaurant for breakfast. Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"Nice environment, nice staff but low quality food. Omelet had the egg smell, egg Benedict's sauce was not good."}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant for many years and who knew they would make a wonderful eggs benedict? 
This store doubles as a restaurant and looks like it was recently renovated. It had a modern, white tone theme. 
I ordered the Eggs Florentine, eggs benedict with spinach. Home fries were on the side. 
The main reason my experience was very enjoyable was because of the cleanliness of not only the space but how the food \"tasted clean.\" It didn't taste greasy like you would expect at most breakfast joints in the area. This includes the home fries. 
One improvement would be ensuring our waters are filled throughout our stay. 
I would return in the future to try their other lunch and dinner options. 
Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"I've tried most of these new trendy breakfast places popping up all over the city, and I just don't get it. Long line ups, tiny restaurants, tiny portions, and recipes with all this new age organic crap. 

All I want is to go have breakfast in a reasonable amount of time, with reasonable portions, fair prices, in a restaurant that isn't cramped. 

For these reasons this is my favourite breakfast place in town. 

Best salmon eggs Benny ever."}
{"text":"This diner is right opposite to Wimpy's yet I have never noticed them. I guess it's because they don't have flashy lights and a life size Betty Boop greeter.

I ordered Salmon Benedict (picture below). Very delicious. Eggs made just right and covered in creamy hollandaise sauce. Slit it open and watch that egg yolk spilling. Salmon was tasty, sitting on a well toasted English muffin. Hash Browns were alright, nothing special though. My friend ordered the sausage & egg breakfast and it looked meh. I suggest that you stick to Benedict.

Spacey, clean diner. Great service. All day breakfast, perfect for night owls. Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Who would've thought a restaurant called Steve's would make such a good chicken souvlaki on a pita and chicken souvlaki platter?  It's better than some Greek restaurants I've tried.

The service has always been good and there's plenty of parking.  Both of these are important to me.  The restaurant has never been too busy for dinner on a weekday.  So I hope they do better on weekends to keep the place in business.

The only issue I have is with the decor.  It is so plain the dining room feels kind of sterile."}
{"text":"Last visit: Jan 2014
Number of visits: 1
Ordered: Smoked salmon egss Benny - 11 dollars

Here are the deets:
Hollandaise sauce - good, nice tangy taste
English muffin - a bit over toasted, should have been creamier.
Poached egg - perfection. With runny yolk
Salmon - store bought lox.  Nothing special.
Hash browns - tasty, not too salty

Coffee - very good for diner space
Atmosphere: it's a semi higher class diner but very clean.

Verdict: would visit if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Steve's has been in Thornhill for a few years  but started at their North York location many years prior.  They specialize in breakfast, although dinner items are offered.  

They have brought the same consistency, speedy service and friendly staff as found at the Bathurst location.  Whether it's fluffy pancakes or their tasty corned beef hash, the breakfast items always deliver."}
{"text":"This Steve is not the same Steve from Bathurst.  Which Steve do I prefer is a tough question to answer as both have it's share of preferred elements.

This Steve doesn't have a Chalkboard on the side wall with Specials or New items so you'll have to stick to the Menu given.  There is however plenty of parking and the Fall Cottagey setting feels quite comfortable here while more natural light is available.

Waitresses were very friendly and YES I did get my Coffee refilled without asking as I dug into my Spanish Omelette($8.79) which served with a half plate of Home Fries and Toast made for a great Late-afternoon Brunch.

Depending on my mood for standard Menu items or New items, that's how you know which Steve I will choose.  Both are as standard as any franchise Breakfast place will be in the outer ranges of the GTA, and again much comparable to Sunset Grill, etc..."}
{"text":"After reading online that this is one of the top restaurants in Thornhill, I decided to give this diner a try. The first time was a 5/5 experience and the second time was a 3/5 experience - I guess it's based on what you order. The first time I came here I tried their chicken parmesan with spaghetti and garlic bread (unfortunately I think they took this off the menu recently). Portions were very generous for the price and I was an instant fan.

I came back a few weeks later to try something different. I got the chicken souvlaki wrap with fries for $13. The wrap itself was extremely small and tasteless and the fries were quite bland. I guess the moral of the story is to stick with breakfast food and pasta dishes. Regardless, service is always friendly and there's plenty of room for parking."}
{"text":"Good breakfast.  It's a cleaned up version of an old school diner. 

There is no hipster attitude or lines or fancy brioche, just good eggs and fantastic drip coffee.   No frills, but worth the price.

Amazing coffee!"}
{"text":"As a child my family and I used to go to the original Steve's. This restaurant and location is nothing like the original. The service was less than mediocre and the food left much to Be Imagined. The restaurant was colder than it was outside, when we asked the staff about turning up the heat he simply replied the heat is on. He didn't ask us if we wanted to be moved to a different location or warmer table. After taking our order the server only filled up our coffees once and the food was barely warm when we received it. I will not be coming back here as the service and staff do not care about the guests."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and brunch with no frills needed. I had the smoked salmon breakfast. Although I am used to my smoked salmon breaky prepared for me, I got my meal delivered to my table this time with the bagel, cream cheese and salmon all separate and I had to prepare it myself. Which I liked because I got to eat it the way I liked it this time :D
My friend had the Grand Slam, or as we like to call it the \"Heart attack breakfast\" 
It was quite hearty (pun intended LOL) although the home fries IMO was a bit soggy, and did not have the crispy outside soft inside texture."}
{"text":"We came today, Mother's Day, & the line up was out the door. While there was a wait, the turnover was quite fast & were seated within about 20 minutes. Both my wife & mom had omelettes, which they both enjoyed. My son had a kids sized chocolate chip pancake with bacon on the side. I had the egged florentine which actually was quite good. 

The only feedback is that as it was quite busy refills on there bitter coffee was hard to come by. We had to ask twice.  There was a nice added touch of a rose for the moms, which the ladies enjoyed.

For breakfast and efficient service, Steves gets a solid four. Definitely a place for brunch and indulgence for a weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good Eggs Benny.  This usually leads me to major hotel restaurants, but you can always find a good representation at a smaller independent restaurant.

Steve's is a spacious restaurant just south of the 407, and worth a quick detour to get a well executed breakfast. Nicely poached eggs, a tasty chunk of pea meal bacon on an English muffin, smothered in Hollandaise.  With a generous portion of home fries, it's a meal that carries me through most of the day.

Eggs Benedict: that's what I came for and it was worth the short deviation.  Become a deviant yourself!"}
{"text":"Whenever I head up north for breakfast/brunch with the parents, it's usually at Steve's.

This is your standard breakfast joint; the eggs are perfectly prepared (I've been to too many places that cannot poach an egg), the home fries are well-seasoned and full cooked. Dad loves the Spanish Omelette. I've had the chicken greek salad as well, which can easily be shared.

While easily dubbed a 'greasy spoon', the food is NOT drenched in pounds of grease/butter/oil/lard like other breakfast joints.

They lost a star because of noise. There is no sound absorption at all because of all the hard surfaces, so it gets quite noisy even if there aren't that many other diners.

The best part is probably the staff & service. They are a very well run group, always friendly, always topping things up and checking in."}
{"text":"Came here for sunday morning breakfast.

This place is traditional breakfast place (eggs, bacon, pancakes, etc)

What we had:
Eggs benedict - definetly worth it, so get this if you like this kind of food.
eggs + turkey bacon + fries and toast - the turkey bacon was dry and not good, don't get it. The food came out warm, not hot. 

The service - Could have been much better. The server took a long time to come and take our order, basically we finished our coffee. The girl that walks around and gives coffee to everyone is doing the best job of them all. By the way coffee is included with all meals. 

I would recommend this to anyone in the area that is looking for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Steve's has been a greasy spoon staple and an Americanized food stop fave for years in my books!

Even though they have their classic location down at Bathurst and Wilson, I wanted to let everyone know of their T-hill, northern location on Yonge Street!

Steve's has been a great brunch stop which is both yummy and cheap. As well, it is always satisfying if you are looking for a big meal.

When I go for brunch, I usually order the eggs with my side of bacon, accompanied by plenty of fruit, hashbrowns and toast. This is all washed down with a free cup of coffee. All of this can be yours for a price of $7.50.

If you are super hungry, go for the Grand Slam breakfast, which includes extra breaky meat, pancakes and extras for $9.99.

For lunches, I recommend a yummy caesar or greek salad. These salads are HUGE and packed with veggies and plenty of croutons for your caesar and tons of feta and salty olives for your greek. And they DO NOT skimp on salad dressing. They even bring you your own personal bottle to use so you can dress your salad to your liking. And they are only $8 each.

Aside from those specific faves of mine at Steve's, the restaurant has a huge selection of sandwiches and wraps, ranging from $6 to $11.

They have delicious huge entree dishes, like their cheap chicken finger platter for $10, the chicken souvlaki dinner for $14 (which is HUGE) and their roast beef or turkey plates for $10.

Top it off with a sweet dessert for $5 and you got yourself an amazing yet inexpensive meal!"}
{"text":"Food is okay for the kind of place it is, but service is sooooo slow! you get exactly what you expect though."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING! 
My boyfriend found a hair in his eggs and after refusing to eat the food, the waiter still brought us our bill claiming the owner demanded we still pay. After asking to speak with him to tell him we were not paying for a meal we did not eat DUE TO A HAIR, we could hear the owner yelling at the poor waiter saying he refuses to speak to us. The waiter then told us in a situation like this, if the customer doesn't pay, the meal would then come out of his pay check. Again, DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast/brunch restaurant.  They make a tasty eggs benedict, which is what I order every time I come here! They provide large portions too and I usually cannot finish the whole plate, which is abnormal for me at most places! The service is great but it can get quite busy on weekends closer to the lunch period. The only thing I was disappointed with was that I thought they made freshly squeezed orange juice, but when I saw the receipt, it said \"Tropicana\" on it... oh well, can't have it all! I'll definitely continue to come back here as the food and prices are quite good and affordable!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years...food is pretty consistent, but service has gone way down hill in the past couple of years. Takes a while to get seated, a while to take the order and then too long to get your food."}
{"text":"3.5

Came here over the weekend for breakfast.  Heard this place has some of the best eggs benny in town.  How did it do?  More after the break

Pros:
Very good eggs benny
Service is amazing

Cons:
Other breakfast items could be better

Reading some of the reviews before mine, it was obvious that we would have to try the eggs benny here.  Took a drive up on a saturday morning.  The restaurant is located in a plaza with ample parking.  The place has a big red sign that stands out so you can't miss it.

We arrive just around 9am and the place is already busy.  When it's busy, it's pretty loud inside.  So if you're looking for a quiet meal, you're going to have to look somewhere else.  Even though it's busy the restaurant is fairly large and we are seated very quickly.

Coming with my GF who is a big fan of eggs benny, she obviously gets that.  I order the grand slam breakfast which comes with eggs, home fries, a link of sausage, 2 strips of bacon, toast and a pancake.  The food comes out a couple of minutes after we order.  The eggs benny look amazing and taste pretty good to boot.  The previous reviews were not lying about this.  My grand slam left me a little disappointed though.  The home fries here are a little over done.  There are pieces that are downright too hard to chew at times. The bacon suffered from the same problems as well.  It was pretty average compared to the eggs benny. 

One thing I need to say though about this place.  We had the absolute best waiter I can remember in recent memory.  I'm sorry that I can't remember his name, but he was awesome.  He was very friendly and helpful.  It felt like he's just loves being there.  His demeanor was cheerful and he apologized for anything even if it wasn't his fault.  I would go back and make sure he's my waiter again.  He's the reason this place got 4 from me even if I felt it was a 3.5.  I will get his name and update this review when I can.  It's the only way to do him justice.      

All in all, this place is nice place to head down for breakfast.  Like everyone before me, get the eggs benny and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service is okay. The food isn't anything to rave about. I had an avocado omelette. I wish I had simply cooked. It's not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times for breakfast and will likely be back.  The service is poor and the food is mediocre but my kids love the chocolate chip pancakes! 

It's also great for groups as it's a fairly large space.  

There is lots of parking and the location is good.  It remains pretty busy even though there is a Wimpys diner and an Eggsmart across the street.  

Not my first choice but really...it's just eggs..."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would!!!! Absolutely Garbage service.  Owner and manager have zero customer service skills."}
{"text":"After googling breakfast in Vaughan this was number 1 and we decided to try. 
Our first impression was good, everything is updated and stylish in the restaurant and the service was quick. 
My son ordered the kids pancake which was 'jumbo' (not really that jumbo as my 4 year old finished off the entire thing with no trouble) and came with no side and cost 4.99! I was put off by the price because kids meals either come with something or are more reasonably priced, however he ate it with no complaints.  
My husband ordered the big breakfast with bacon, peameal,  sausage eggs toast and a pancake. He was by no means blown away but he was satisfied enough. He did not care for the hashbrowns and was surprised that there was only one of each meat, but overall a breakfast that you could get just about anywhere.  
I got the eggs Benedict and was pleasantly surprised! The hollandaise was some of the best I've had and that is saying something considering that eggs Benny is always my breakfast go to.  
The hollandaise sauce was perfectly seasoned, there was plenty and the eggs were on Pointe.  
Overall, I was disappointed with the kids meal and my husband wasn't blown away by his meal but my eggs benny was hit out of the park. 
I don't know if we'll be back because of the distance traveled to get there,  but if there are any eggs benny lovers out there like me, this is a great spot!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast menu but unfortunately I don't like eating breakfast food in the morning. Luckily they offer different options for non-breakfast eaters. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and instantly loved it at first bite. The restaurant is overall a friendly atmosphere and offer great service"}
{"text":"Please people!  Post only honest reviews!  I read positive feedbacks here so I convinced my hubby to have an early morning breakfast at this place.  The menu special looks good.  Two eggs and bacon for $6.75 and Steve's egg Benedict for $9.99 includes coffee.  Yes, I ordered the eggs Benedict.  Btw if you come in after 11am, the price of eggs Benedict is $13.99.  Grand slam is $12.99 coffee is extra charge.  True, we waited for awhile and I thought , it must be real good for the wait.  

Food arrived and bummer!  Eggs Benedict came in soaking with hollandaise sauce as if the whole pot was poured over the two eggs.  The bottom English muffin was soaked on sauce.  I had to scrape off the thick salty sauce just to eat the eggs with mushrooms etc.  forget about eating the wet burnt bottom bread. Disgusting!  The home fries were cold and mushy.  Waitress told me that's how they serve their home fries cold and mushy not crispy!  I asked her to taste them.  What the hell!  Hubby ordered the grand slam and poor thing had to eat one piece of small pancake that looked like prepared from Costco premix just add water and serve.  One sausage split in half.  Coffee was not good and tasted crap. But bacon was crispy - that's only best thing my hubby liked.  

Waste of money!  

I will not recommend this restaurant at all!  If breakfast is horrible, I can just imagine lunch and dinner Is even worse.  Please be honest in your reviews!"}
{"text":"Great staff, amazing breakfast. 

Had my first eggs Benedict here and I was OBSESSED! it's so good it's legit the perfect breakfast. I had it somewhere else a week later and it was so gross compared to steves famous eggs Benny. My friends are obsessed with this place too. If you feel like breakfast.. Steves doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"There are a variety of breakfast places that has opened up in Thornhill and around it. There is an Eggsmart across the street, a Symposium up the next mall, a Wimpy's across the street, a Pickle Barrel further down, and the ubiquitous fast food places surround Steve's.
The place is popular in town and many of the people who are familiar with it, dine in their north location. I have been to the Toronto location on a few occasions and their North location - though not as busy, is just as good overall.
When I do go to the restaurant, it is normally for breakfast. They do a good job with the eggs - less browning when asked for an over med/hard than the other guys."}
