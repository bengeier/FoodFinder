{"text":"Manna is amazing always consistent food is so flavorful and juicy and excellent quality my husband & I eat here. 3 to 4 times a week the hummus is so creamy and delicious with homemade quality definitely a restaurant everyone should try you'll be in love and addicted from your first visit tell them Tommy sent you"}
{"text":"Manna Monday!  Great food and old school staff who treat you like family.  I recommend the gyro crispy, caesar salad, hummus and grape leaves.  Basically, if you ask for specific items they will accomodate.  Patience and clear language when you order will help"}
{"text":"So, last Friday some coworkers and I decided to order. We put an order in over $30 with a man and were told it would arrive in 40-50 minutes.... 55minutes later, we call to check on our order because our lunch nearly over we wanted to make sure that we were available to receive it. The phone was answered by a woman who vehemently denies we ever called and rudely told us how mistaken we were, that we must have called another business because they didn't even have a delivery driver working that day.... Now we are happily refusing to ever order from this restaurant again. Sorry Manna, you lost a corporate account because you couldn't have at least lied nicely.... Boss just ordered all 50 of us lunch... Not from you... Thanks for the lunch party, @RaisingCanes!"}
{"text":"Lamb Gyro's are delish !!!! Even the Baklava is homemade. I will return again for more. Don't bother with the philly's"}
{"text":"I've been eating here quite a bit over the past few weeks and have had nothing but good experiences every time. The owners (husband & wife I think) are super nice and always greet me with a warm smile and hello.  The chicken shawarma plate or chicken shawarma sandwich is what I usually get and the meat is moist and flavorful. While I would like to see some pickled vegetables with the plates (like Yalla! has), it really isn't that big of a deal. The hummus is pretty flavorful; I wouldn't say it is an award winner, but it is still very tasty. The salad that comes with the plate is just a small side-salad, but the dressing is good and it fills that veggie role of the meal. The french fries here are awesome; I know that really isn't a selling point for anybody, but they are different than most restaurant's french fries. Crispier and full of flavor.  I can't say the interior is something to write home about, just a small \"mom&pop\" shop that caters mostly to carry-out orders probably. But really, who cares what the place looks like? I mean, it isn't at all bad looking inside. Quite the opposite, everything is new, it's just small and not ambient. But again, who cares about that, the food is what you should care about.  All in all i give a 4/5. Not perfect, but a great place to grab a quick bite or take out some delicious Mediterranean food!  PS. Don't listen to all of these posts from 2012 and early in 2013. I don't know if it was  different a year or two ago, but the place is spot on now! At least give it a try for yourself, a meal is like $10-12 bucks. Don't forget the garlic sauce!"}
{"text":"I've had take out here before and loved it, especially since it's easy to pick up on the way home.  After a busy day,  I thought I'd pick up food for the family. Even though the hours posted online said it was open, no one picked up the phone and when driving up to it there was a closed sign.   Guess we are eating Robert's Tacos instead :-/"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST MEDITERRANEAN FOOD IN LAS VEGAS/HENDERSON! I have pretty much tried everything on the menu and my favorite is the Lamb Gyro and hummus! The pizza is so good also! My work orders from here 2-3 times a week and if they like it then it's definitely worth it ! Family owned business so it' has that love and care touch put into the food which is important to me :) if you are in the Henderson and hungry you must try it out!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is out of this world.  You have got to try this place if you have never been!  They are some of the best cooks I have ever come across, doesn't matter what it is they are making, it always winds up incredible."}
{"text":"This is the closest Mediterranean restaurant to my residence and the best I've had in the Henderson/Las Vegas area.  Prices are reasonable and service is great...has that family-run feel.   I've tried a couple of other place near the house but they just weren't as good as Manna."}
{"text":"The gyro is the best meal because it has a lot of flavor and if you want food fast then this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Having eaten Mediterranean food all my life this is bad food for the price. There are other better Mediterranean joints around this place that's for sure."}
{"text":"I have ordered here many times having as it is right down the road from my office. (Auto Mall) We have never been disappointed by the food or the service here. Especially with as large of an order as we place at times, they have always gotten things sorted very clearly and all without mix ups. So far I've tried a few different things on them menu, no disappointments to far!"}
{"text":"Amazing hummus, so smooth. The baba is freaking amazing too, but unfortunately they don't sell much of it so they've stopped making it.  Falafel wrap and grape leaves are both good choices.  They serve breakfast now, too, from 7 to 11."}
{"text":"Waw, I was very surprised.  It taste exactly like back home.  I would definitely recommend this to friends this I love only.  The rest I will recommend some other restaurants lol.  It's very affordable and it taste excellent.  Thank you Sheff Manna."}
{"text":"Our whole family LOVES Manna! We have loved it since the first taste! Never had problems, and never have been disappointed. The service is outstanding, food is consistently delicious, and we recommend it to anyone looking for a new place to eat! Since we are regulars at Manna, we have developed a family-like relationship with them that is unbreakable! They are the sweetest people, with the best intentions. There is not one negative thing to say about Manna. All restaurants have there flaws, and by reading some reviews, nobody understands that! -Olivia (:"}
{"text":"After eating casino food for 4 days, my hubby and I we're looking for a healthy lunch option while on our way out of town. We checked online reviews and decided to try this place after the original place we were going to eat at was closed for the weekend. Boy are we glad we did!! We walked in and were promptly greeted by the owners. I was not sure what to get so the lady owner recommended a chicken dish. I said \"Ok, sounds good!\" and waited patiently as she cooked all of it from scratch. About 20 minutes later it was done and she brought it to me. It looked delicious but when I took my first bite, all I could think was WOW!! This food is absolutely scrumptious! All of it! I think I licked my plate clean! The chicken was marinated and cooked perfect. I loved the rice, the salad, the salad dressing, and the tortilla type things. I especially like the white sauce stuff that she said is made out of olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic. I would by it by the jar if I could! On my next trip back to Vegas I will definitely be coming back to eat here. It's worth the drive no matter where you are in town."}
{"text":"This place smells like chickpeas and angst. Their food is very simple and very delicious. Nothing over the top but you won't be disappointed. I recommend the gyro, pizzas and all the dips are fire except the missing cucumber in the cucumber sauce. I could easily over eat on these gyros the meat is so fresh and tasty. Great place, maybe the engine needs an oil change tho."}
{"text":"I just found out that they are open for BREAKFAST!!! All the food is made fresh, everything tasted amazing. I will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"I came with my husband for dinner at manna I had the shrimp kebab plate my husband had Falafel sandwich the food is delicious and the service is great I will be back and for sure I recommend this restaurant and they are serving for breakfast now from 7 am til 11 am i will come back snd try it They serving croissant roll with sausage cheese and eggs also they have on letter and crepe I will try Nutella crepe."}
{"text":"The guy working the counter (I think his name was Michael) was amazing! He was very friendly and accommodating. I ended up ordering some kind of sampler; my favorite out of that one was the falafel. I also got some stuffed grape leaves and baklava. The grape leaves were HEAVENLY and now they are one of my favorite snacks. I wasn't a big fan of the baklava, but it was the first time I've ever had it, so I would say to try it before listening to me. Loved the service and the food was good. Whenever I'm back in the area, I'll be sure to come back."}
{"text":"So good. The staff is always friendly and my food is always out so quickly. I've been here many times and have never encountered any problems. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent baba ganoush and gyros!! Found this place because it's right next to Touro, where I went to nursing school. Graduated 5 years ago and moved to the southwest area of Vegas, but I still find myself driving back to Henderson just for some amazing Mediterranean food. Their pita is so soft and warm. One of the best gyros I have ever had. The husband and wife who run the place are very friendly, and always smiling when I walk in. Will always come back."}
{"text":"stumbled upon this little gem by accident and boredom and soo happy we did!  they make alot of the menu items homemade and cater to vegetarians. i've tried lots of greek places in vegas and this place has the absolute best homemade pita's and falafel. very fresh food, clean restaurant, kind staff + cheap + fast, wow!!"}
{"text":"Good, authentic food.  My wife likes the tabouli (sp?), I like the chicken dishes, particularly when he has shwarma.   All of the food I've ever ordered has been fresh.  Prices are about right.  Not a busy location.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I too allowed the negative reviews to keep me away from this place even though its close to home. I finally came in dying for a good gyro and with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. The staff is warm and friendly. The customers seem to be regulars and the tzatziki sauce is AMAZING. The tables and chairs are admittedly best for waiting for your food to go, there's no comfort or style to the decor...but its a neighborhood grab and go spot so what do you expect?!"}
{"text":"The male owner is very rude. The products they use are very cheap. I heard they buy their food from Costco? This must be a health dept issue. Dirty tables etc. was very disappointed and will not come back. Humans is really good but the food sucks."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at this place. The owners are wonderful and the food is consistently good. Would highly recommend if you like Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"We made the trip across town from Summerlin to try Manna for the first time and were not disappointed. While the dining room may not be impressive, the food and prices certainly are.   The 2 of us shared a veggie plate (falafel, baba ganoush, tabouleh, dolmades and hummus $12.95) and a chicken shawarma sandwich ($6.25). The veggie platter was great; all of the items were seasoned and cooked to perfection. They hadn't made the hummus for the day yet, so they gave us extra falafel which was our favorite part of the meal. The shawarma was delicious; nice and juicy with a good char on the outside.   If you're looking for great tasting food at a great price be sure to check them out. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent mediterranean food. Definitely the best in henderson. Their hummus is one of the best, if not the best I have tried so far in henderson."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and staff is always friendly. I recommend the gyro sandwich! Great spot to pick up lunch"}
{"text":"This is my new go to for Mediterranean food. Manna's is a very unpretentious mom and pop restaurant with fresh made to order food.  Decent menu and they will substitute items if there is something you prefer, for example, I like humus instead of salad. My wife got the vegetarian plate and doesn't like smoky flavored eggplant so they offered her extra falafels. Just really down to earth folks making an honest living delivering some remarkable food. I come here at least once a week. I wish Manna's continued success and hope to enjoy your food for many years to come. I used to go to Stephano's on Eastern but you cant beat Manna's for price, quality and flavor. Give it  try I think you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Awesome place will come back again  Good food Good customer service  Clean restaurant  This is my third visit to manna Mediterranean and it keeps getting better  Strongly recommend this place for catering as well ... we ordered food to my workplace and they did a great job"}
{"text":"No complaints so if you are looking for the downside to dining at Manna... You'll not find it here!  Thick softest most delicious pita was a comfy home to my gyro!  My mistake came in offering a bite near the end to my son who had finished his kebob already! Nope, I never saw the last of my gyro! He loved his meal and the last of mine as well!    A salad taken to go was devoured with much appreciation as well!"}
{"text":"Great food, however, please note that if your delivery address is inconvenient for the delivery (sorry that 4 minutes of drive time is too long), the owner will let you know that he drives a BMW and will not deliver to you, so he's just gonna cancel your order all together and not let you get a word in edgewise.    Didn't know that BMWs can't drive that far!  Maybe the dealership can fix your problem."}
{"text":"Food was very bland. Gyro was greasy. Service is a tad slow. Definitely better Greek options available nearby."}
{"text":"I come to Henderson for work a few times a month for work and eat lunch here at least once per trip. Service is great, food is great, and I've never had to wait an unreasonable amount of time. Haven't ventured to the pizza or calzone side of the menu but their schwarma and gyros are great."}
{"text":"A good solid lunch!!! Such a nice couple running the place. They made us feel like family!  Expect to wait a bit, as the cook to order, but it's worth the wait.  Portions were good, and the chicken was tender. Hubs has a traditional gyro. He said it had great flavor. I would have given five if the drink selections would have been better.  Other than that, solid place"}
{"text":"Delicious food with Vegan options. I go there often and also order for many of our meetings. I compare many of the Mediterranean food places I eat at or try to this place. Their hummus, fries and falafals are delicious. My husband loves the chicken kabobs, shrimp and shish kabobs. My team loves the gyros here also. All is good, they get busy around lunch time so we call in our order and pick up to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"I want in with my family. We had the lamb gyro (my 10 year old sone loved), chicken shawarma and falafel. The food was very good and the falafel was great. Everything was fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"A fantastic family owned restaurant that serves healthy delicious food for great prices! Thus food is made fresh daily and seasoned so perfectly. I can't get enough of their chicken schwarma, marinated juicy chunks of white meat. My son loves their Gyros, fresh pita warm and smelling so good with homemade tatzyicki with the perfect tang!!!  The beef and chicken are amazing. A must try!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I probably eat here twice a week, my favorite plate is the Chicken Kabab Plate, although everything I've tried so far has been great. Ghada & Mike really put a lot of effort on serving healthy and delicious food. One thing I would say to future customers is that the food takes around 10-15 min to be ready, so often, what I'd do is call 15 min before going there and place my order. I prefer fresh food that takes a little bit of time, rather than ready to go plastic ones.  LOVE MANNA!  Note: Try out the garlic sauce!!!!!! and to the owners please open a fan club with rewards :D"}
{"text":"Very friendly owners run the place. They have the absolute best Mediterranean food in all of Vegas and Henderson on my opinion. You can tell with every bite that they use very high quality meat and ingredients."}
{"text":"So we were skeptical of this place but then pleasantly surprised. My hubby had the original gyro and I had the chicken kabob plate both came with salads and both were DELICIOUS and completely fresh made. The atmosphere is nothing special but we will definitely go back for the food."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try somewhere new for lunch. Everyone loved their meals (buffet, spicy gyro, chicken kabobs and pizza).  The staff had to also be the owners. You just don't get that sort of attention and pride from employees."}
{"text":"Maybe a better dine in experience. We had it delivered causeway were tired but it's about a 7m drive. Food temp was fine. Order was correct and packaged well. Got the falafel wrap x 2 and a side of fries. The falafel wrap was so dry for some reason. It had tomato pickle and tahini but was still so dry and hard to eat. The pita itself was like tearing apart and cheating a leather base ball glove. Had hoped to get some ketchup or something to eat the fries with... those also were eaten dry. I did notice how they charge extra for tahini sauces... so maybe that the angle. Serve dry food sell extra sauce? I don't know. You might like it though. It seems like it could be good!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Had the traditional gyro and beef kabobs. Meats were tender. This is my second time eating here and I like the atmosphere. Everyone there are friendly and courteous. Never had a problem with service or my food. Too bad they don't deliver anymore. Overall the food is good and the price is reasonable. I will go back. They now serve breakfast too from 7-11 AM."}
{"text":"My coworker and I ordered a couple calzones from this place today because their menu was taped to our door this morning and we thought we'd give them a shot.  We got the food at a reasonable time, but found that the price we had to pay was around $5 more than what was explained on the phone during our order. The employee delivering the food indicated that the additional charge was for the condiments we selected. This is a bit misleading. The menu states that 2 toppings are included per order with each calzone ordered. We did not order any additional toppings.  When we got our food, one of the calzones had the wrong toppings.  Both calzones had so much grease inside that it eventually seeped out of the edges of the box making a mess all over our desks. Not to mention it made the crust super soggy and unappetizing.   To top that off, they did not provide any napkins or eating utensils with the delivery.  I will not order from this place again nor will I recommend it to any of my contacts."}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean restaurants in town. Glad to find out they deliver to my home. Their fillet mignon kabob is bar none the best one I've had. Great quality and price all around."}
{"text":"I love Gyros and this wasn't the place to get a good one.  There are way better places around the Henderson area to get one.  Prices seemed too high as well"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good.  However, our order was incomplete when received.  We were missing a drink as well as three extra sauces that were requested."}
{"text":"I've made it my personal mission in life to seek out and try any and all Mediterranean restaurants in any town I live in. I finally made it out to Henderson to try this spot, and I have to say, despite the friendly service, the food sadly wasn't worth the trek.  Standard gyro is meaty, and the tzatziki sauce is a bit different than usual- did not seem to contain any cucumbers? There is a lunch option to add on fries and a drink for an affordable price. The side of dolmades (grape leaves) tasted a little off, as if perhaps they were out of a jar. Filling texture was gummy and off-putting, and there was a strong, bitter after-taste that lingered uncomfortably that I haven't encountered with other versions.  Service was polite and the location is clean, but pricing is all over the place: $6 for a gyro is great, $2 to add on feta is a little absurd. I wanted to grab some falafel as a side, but the appetizer order is over $5. I think the odd pricing is why most reviewers (myself now included) only recommend the lunch special."}
{"text":"Been wanting to leave a review for this place near my home and haven't had the chance till now. Five stars is an understatement, the place isn't fancy but the food and service is outstanding. Be prepared to wait a bit for your food because most is made fresh to order. My wife and I had two gyros and a side order of falafel , both were excellent and reasonably priced and the service was great. Can't believe we haven't tried this place till now, we will definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"I live pretty close to this place so I figured I'd stop in & give it a try. The woman was not very friendly, but I tipped her anyway. I ordered a chicken gyro/salad combo & took it to go. I got home & it was not chicken but lamb. I don't eat lamb, so I called & told them about the error & placed a new order. When I walked in, the woman who had taken my order didn't even look at me much less offer an apology for the inconvenience. The man was nice, but he didn't apologize either.  The food was okay, but the chicken was kind of bland. I'm sorry, but quality of service is just as important as the quality of the food. Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Manna is a delicious Mom & Pop Mediterranean Restaurant. Mrs. makes her falafel each day from scratch and they sell out. They're the best I've ever eaten. The spicey gyro is also the best!!! I do ask for the pita bread on my falafel as I love the fluffy texture vs The the un-leaven flatbread that it usually comes with.   I keep saying I'm going to try their pizza but when I get here I can't resist the gyro or falafel.   #support local #wonderfulfoodwonderfulfamily!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live right by here, but had never stopped to try it until the other day. This was my first gyro experience. The place was dead, but it was also 3:00 in the afternoon on a Sunday. The service was fast and the owner helped us out. Very nice guy. The gyro was delicious! We will be coming back for sure! Prices were okay."}
{"text":"This was my first Gyro experience; I wasn't impressed. Since then I've had better Gyros. I don't know what it was, but it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Ssriously the freshest Mediterranean food I have ever had - and I am from NYC! Watched them make everything from scratch, the falafel and baba ghanouge are to die for! Highly recommended! :)"}
{"text":"This is the second time I order from this place to deliver to my hospital ..first time they got our order wrong!! ..this time it took 90 min to deliver the food !! And it was cold !!! I especially asked them how long for delivery because of our tight schedule being nurses they say 45min it took doble the time!! ..come on !!if u can't  deliver on time u should take the order !! They should even offer a little something to fix the problem ,never order from this place again !!"}
{"text":"I had a gyro here and it tasted pretty good. I thought the meat could've been a little warmer but it could've just been me. A little pricier than others. I was also greeted when I walked in which is a plus."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my Chicken Gyro and the dulmas that I had today.  The meat was very juicy and well marinated, the vegetables and pita were also quite fresh.  The atmosphere could use a bit of improvement, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it.  This is a Mediterranean gem that needs a bit more exposure.  Highly recommended for something different than the usual fare."}
{"text":"BEST BEST BEST HUMMUS IN TOWN. Best hummus in vegas. Highly recommend this restaurant the owner (don't remember his name) but he is cool. Friendly and awesome all around hope this place gets he recognition it deserves. Located near Touro University and the Auto Show Mall. TRY THE HUMMUS SO SO DELICIOUS THE REAL DEAL. Cheers"}
{"text":"This was brought in as a catered lunch for the office. I'm not a big fan of greek food, but hey you only live once so \"seize the food!\". haha  I'm guessing it was the lunch special. I had the boxed special? which consisted of Salad, Chix gyro? it wasnt that bad.  Considering this place is around the corner? its a possible lunch place to hit when I'm tired of the usual lunch food."}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean spot in Henderson! Sooo happy to have stopped here only to be served by two of the sweetest people.  Not only were they friendly but the food was amazing.   We were on our way to a different Greek place and saw this on our way.  We swung around and stopped here instead. It was one of the most enjoyable evenings i have had in a while. We will be returning again."}
{"text":"This is a great place for delivery! I have not tried everything on the menu but I'm a fab of their chicken options over their beef options. The garlic sauce that come with is yummmmy. I'm not a fan of their side salads but the pita/hummus is good."}
{"text":"This place is clean, sales person is very polite and helpful! Food was delivered quickly and tasted fantastic! Definitely going to be a staple every time we visit Henderson/Vegas!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place...but I just don't.  It's a small, mom n pop owned cafe in a strip mall on Gibson. I'm all for supporting small, family run businesses.  Inside is pretty basic- it's clean, and the menu is broad enough w selections. Prices are reasonable.  The service is just okay..the wife seems more tired or short, the man seems indifferent.  I had the veggie plate. The food was okay, somewhat bland. Nothing delectable or memorable about the flavors.  Being a food related small business owner myself, the thing that is missing in so many places is that no one LOVES the food they are making or serving to their customers. That's exactly how I feel here. They aren't serving up a dish w love. They are just serving it up...period. So-no warm and fuzzies to be had regarding taste, experience, etc.  I probably won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"great delivery option in henderson. chicken kebab, hummus and rice were all good. recommend!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I ordered one original combo, one flafel wrap and grape leaves. The lady charged me 5.25 instead of 2.25 for the grape leaves and forgot the fries. Just found it out at home. When drove back to the restaurant they were already closed with the lights off. this is second time she messed up. Worse thing is I tipped her for food. Hell... good food but dont wanna go back ever."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Mediterranean places all over town and my favorite are Falafels. This place has the best I have ever tried. Delivery is fast and hot when it arrives and they are always friendly when we go in. Love this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken shawarma plus fries and small soda for an additional $2.00. I also ordered hummus.  1. The chicken was plain grilled chicken. It was NOT even shawarma (meat that is grilled on a spit and shaved off). The lettuce and tomato was dry. And there were pickles, not even picked veggies...WTF? The pita was at least warmed up. 2. Fries were acceptable. 3. The texture of the hummus was smooth but boring. It didn't even have a distinct chickpea flavor. 4. Ambience: It looks like it's going to go out of business soon. It was kind of depressing.  This experience really made me miss Zankou Chicken in California."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. I've come here several times because it is close to my workplace. Each time I somehow managed to get screwed over. It's come to the point where I come back with the curiosity to find out how I could get screwed this time. It's quite comical. Other than that, the food isn't that bad and I'll keep coming cause Greek food is healthier than fast food."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch one day with my boyfriend on my lunch break since I work close by.  When I got there, the lady (owner?) was eating at a table and got up to help me. During the whole process, she acted majorly inconvenienced and didn't make eye contact with me at all.  I ordered the garlic chicken gyro, he had a combo plate, and we shared a side of hummus. With a drink, somehow this added up to about $30, which I thought was ridiculous.  The food was ok, my chicken was extremely greasy, but my boyfriend thought his food was all right. The hummus portion was huge, which was nice, and it was delicious.  We didn't get any napkins with our meal and there were none to be seen anywhere in the lobby.  Rather than inconvenience the lady eating again, we just did without.    I will comment on the cleanliness, or lack thereof, of the place. Like another poster, when we were at the drink station it was just NASTY.  There was like, open ketchup squirted all over, and 2 out of the 8 drink options were out of service. When we went to throw away our food in the trash can (under one of those stands with the swinging door, we noticed THERE WAS NO TRASH CAN, but did see a lot of nasty old food and like, mold where the trash can was. I guess they must've been just taking it out?? Anyway, we didn't see a single other customer during my entire lunch hour, and I guess we know why now.   Meh food + meh service + not cheap = don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would !!!!It was my first time at this restaurant. It is 2 PM and I received no acknowledgement from ONE guy that was there. He was a man with a mustache. He didn't even say hello or give me a second . He continued cooking his food. I waited there for 15 minutes and got tired of waiting !!!! Ridiculous would not recommend"}
{"text":"Been here twice and the experience was horrible. My Togo orders took over a half hour, which completely ate up my lunch break. And to top it off my food was cold and tasted prepackaged. I will not be visiting this \"restaurant\" every again."}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone's problem is I thought it was fine.  Great place for quick Mediterranean food. Walked in with a friend and the place looked very clean. There was a woman cleaning the tables and a man behind the counter.  I asked the man about some of the food and he was more than friendly!   We ended up ordering a Shawarma plate and a combo dinner (Kifta and Chicken) to go. The man said we had to wait about 10 mins for the Chicken to grill and was very apologetic about having us wait.  It was no problem! When the food was ready he gave to us with another apology for the wait and told us to enjoy.  The food was great. Shawarma came with a lot of meat, Hummus, bread, Salad and Tzaki sauce. Combo dinner came with grilled chicken, kifta (I guess you can say its like meatloaf patty), rice, salad, salad dressing separately, Tzaki sauce, and some garlicy white stuff that tasted good, but I have no idea what it was.   Didn't rate 5 stars because, while I won't say its was expensive, it wasn't the cheapest place around and the selection was all that big. I'll definitely be coming again though."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I got the greek salad with grilled chicken, which is $10.50. Its just too expensive for fast food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite for lunch, our first time here. Ordered the shrimp plate an to my surprise it was good, kinda over priced."}
{"text":"I really like this place but they are always out of what I order, which is always the same two items, and they're both appetizers. I got to the point where I wouldn't even go without calling to check ahead first, and the last couple of times I have called they of course informed me that they were out of what I wanted. I don't understand how you can run a restaurant and never have what's on your menu. I really do love their food, but I can't love it when they don't have it. Also, there is another mediterranean restaurant 2 minutes up the road from this place, which really makes it a no brainer to go there instead, since they always have food."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shwarma. It came with some hummus, pita, and greek salad. I enjoyed everything. But I've had better shwarma. It was pretty dead in there, but the owner was friendly. All in all, it's decent, but not great."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have eaten in Henderson! The service is awful I dont even think the owners know when someone comes into the place to eat. I practically had to yell to get some some service. That and the food is awful!!!! avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"This was the best gyro I've ever had!!! I look forward to the next time!!! Fresh tasting and delivered fast!!! I'm sure the rest of their menu is just as good"}
{"text":"I grabbed a quick order of humus and grape leaves to go. Good and fast with friendly staff. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from this place I really liked it. The man who delivered the order told me that I lived kind of far (I'm in Green Valley) but that it was ok and they were \"happy to have me.\" I was pretty stoked because I love Mediterranean cuisine and the place nearest to me is pretty average.   I decided to place an order again the following day (via grubhub.) About 15 minutes after I got a call from Grubhub saying that the restaurant cancelled my order. I thought perhaps there was some mistake so I called Manna directly and asked why it was cancelled- the man said I was way too far away (7 miles.) I tried to explain that I had just ordered yesterday without any problems and I thought he was rude for cancelling my order like that when I would have been a regular customer and had no issues the day before. I explained that it was not my fault that Grubhub failed to limit his delivery area, I am just a customer using their platform... I asked him if he could possibly just charge a higher deliver fee for those of us who lived a little further away, to make up for the difference. However the man was upset at the fact that I used the word \"rude\" so he hung up on me while I was trying to get a word in edgewise while he was ranting about how he isn't \"rude.\" Ok.   I called back just to get the point across that I was not trying to have an argument with this man. I was disappointed at the fact that I had found a good restaurant to order from that now refused to service my area. And yes, it was rude that he cancelled my order without taking the time to call me himself and explain, and made worse by the fact that he hung up on me when I called to inquire. If you are too fragile as a business owner to handle being called \"rude\" when you actually do behave rudely, then good luck to you...  I simply wanted to see if he could work something out so I could keep ordering from them, and he hangs up after a minute on the phone because I said it was \"rude.\"   They are located off Gibson and it takes literally 10-15 minutes MAX to get to my place if one utilizes the freeway... I drive to that area all the time. I would have happily paid $5-$6 extra for delivery but I guess they don't want or need my business. To be fair he did say I could replace the order and he would have it delivered but I would have to wait 45 more minutes, I thanked him and got off the phone and just decided to go with another spot. The food here is not worth the drama.   I will gladly go back to ordering from my average Mediterranean restaurant..."}
{"text":"Best shrimp skewers in town. They are large and very delicious. They give generous portions for the price as well. Love the owners, very nice people! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  I went here with two of my friends and between the three of us, we tried a bunch of dishes. The food is excellent! And the owners are pretty cool, too. They came out of the kitchen to check on us (no waiter service) and talk a bit. The woman told us that it takes her two days to make the fresh hummus from scratch, because she does everything, down to soaking and grinding the beans. I hadn't had falafel in a long time, and the ones served here were awesome! They tasted just like I remember them. Mmmmm!  The prices are decent, too. My falafel meal was under $5, though you can also get other items, more food for more.  This is my new favorite greek place to eat. :)"}
{"text":"Only went here one time. I'd ordered a kabobs meal from there and didn't like it. Pricey for not so enjoyable meal. People are friendly, but I'm not so sure about the food."}
{"text":"When I was a student at Touro University, I always had lunch at Manna's. It was so good that I keep coming back to this place. Right now, I just had my Christmas party at home for my former classmates. Manna Mediterranean Restaurant did my catering for this party. I ordered the garlic chicken kabob, it was so juicy and the garlic sauce was great. I also had a plate of beef kabob. They use filet mignon, it was so tender and melts in your mouth. They also gave me extra sauce and pita bread, besides the homemade rice and salad that came with my catering order. My classmates asked me for the address so they too can come to eat at Manna's. My party was a great success. Thank you Manna Mediterranean Restaurant."}
{"text":"I've driven by this restaurant SOOO many times (it's on the way to work) but have never tried it.  Partly because of the number of negative Yelp feedback it has received.  Partly because when I pull into this parking lot I'm always in the mood for a carne asada burrito at Roberto's.  But since seeing The Avengers last weekend, I've had an undying craving for shawarma so today I had to feed that monster.  Ordered the shawarma plate which came with steak shawarma, hummus, a salad and pita.  All of it was delicious and very fresh.  The pita was crazy soft and warm.  The hummus was adequate, not a whole lot of flavor but nice and smooth.  I was disappointed that they didn't have lamb but the steak shawarma was tender, flavorful and perfect.  I also ordered a side of dulmas.  I'm a sucker for stuffed grape leaves and these didn't disappoint.  Soft, flavorful, delicious.  They probably didn't need to serve it in a separate styro-box though and the bed of shredded lettuce they were lying on was unnecessary and a bit annoying.  Mama suggested I try her falafel next time I came in--she makes it from scratch, not from powder.  I told her I'm not a big falafel fan but she insisted I'd like these.  Will check it out next time!  Took mine to go so I can't attest to the \"stickiness\" of the tables or anything but the place looked clean to me.  I sat in the little corner booth with the low table while I waited for my food--thought it was a pretty nice touch.  I'd totally sit there with a group of people.  Bonus points for the poster of Tony Stark in his Iron Man suit in the front window...\"What is shawarma?\"  :)  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If this review was on the standard beef-lamb gyro alone it would be a 5 out of 5 star review. The meat and pita were both great! The store itself is a nice little restaurant, very friendly service and appears to be family owned. Unfortunately their pitas are not homemade as I had previously read in other reviews, I saw them being taken from a branded bag in the back and placed in the toaster oven. I also had the fried zucchini with my Gyro which was very good but extremely dry with no sauces offered. When asked I was given a Tatziki sauce cup that was fantastic on it's own but mixed absolutely horribly with the taste of the Zucchini. Overall though the Gyro, sauce, pita (even though store bought), environment, and price were all very good.  If you are looking for other Greek/Mediterranean lunch alternatives I highly recommend The Great Greek just around the corner."}
{"text":"I've eaten here over a dozen times and know it quite well. I guess the fact that I've returned so many times probably counts for something. The owners are friendly and will often ask you how you are doing and what they can do to improve your dining experience.  Sometimes I come away incredibly satisfied with the portion sizes and seasoning. I often enjoy their shawerma wraps with a bit of hot sauce. I've tried all of the chicken wraps with varied results-- sometimes they come out dry and sometimes they come out awesome. The fries are a tasty snack. I don't enjoy the gyros here near as much as I do at nearby Greek Bistro -- it feels like the tzatsiki sauce just isn't that authentic. I've had dinner platters here and absolutely loved them. I've also had kabob wraps and found the meat to be painfully dry. Or awesome, it just varies.  I like this place because it is conveniently located near the 215 and Touro University. I also like the fact that it's a mom and pop owned establishment. However, the bottom line is that the service and quality here varies. Some of the employees come across as a bit apathetic and I think this comes through in the food. I recommend this place during lunch time because its a hell of a lot better than paying the same amount of money for a generic, corporate sub from you-know-where and they do have some delicious recipes. I encourage you to give it a shot-- it's relatively unique as a fast food Mediterranean joint."}
{"text":"When I arrived on Saturday they didn't have lamp or beef Kafta, so I had to eat something that they wanted me to eat! Than  I ordered to go one Gyro and one platter beef  strip slices. I couldn't find any extra napkins ..When I needed to ask them  napkins, staff members no where to be found!  So I had to basically lousy lunch which cost me $20 !not a customer friendly and after all not a pleasant visit!  I will not recommend any want to go there"}
{"text":"10/10 do not recommend this place. Also, too expensive for such bad quality.  Very bad service. Ordered a pizza and had to wait for it over an hour. They started baking it 1 hour later after I had ordered and literally left it in the oven for 10 minutes , that's probably why the toppings were raw. Oh, and Nobody apologized for the delay of my pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. Fresh always. Great prices. I love the chicken humus salads."}
{"text":"A family owned restaurant. What I ordered was delicious..falafel wrap. I am sure everything on the menu is good. Even though it's 3&half star right now, I give it a 5. We had a nice time, all my friends stated they loved what they ordered. No complains here :)"}
{"text":"I should have just ordered the salad like I was going to do.  So I got the combo without the Gyro meat.  So he gave me extra chicken and falafel .  The guy was really nice.  He said it would take about 10 min for the chicken, and was going to give me a soda while I waited.  (I only drink soda if it has liquor in it)  So I passed on the soda.  So I got my food to go.  I was on the run.  I ate the hummus, and the pita, it was delish!  I couldn't wait to try the rest of it.  So I dug into the chicken, but there were 3 different sauces, I didn't know which one to dip the chicken in!  I'm no Mediterranean expert, but this should have come with instructions, and labels what to dip in this sauce and what to dip in that sauce!  I tried one sauce with the chicken, and nahhhh, that wasn't the one, so I just ate it dry.  I'm sure it was better for me without the sauce.  The chicken was ok.  So now I tried the falafel.  Again, I tried to dip it in one of the 3 sauces, and I decided to just eat it dry, I couldn't figure it out! Ummmm, I took a few bites just to make sure I didn't like it......I didn't like it at all!  So now I'm eating the salad, not much flavor! I I had to add some feta cheese to it, and it's still bland!  OMG  what a waste of my $$ I should have just tried the $4.99 pizza special."}
{"text":"My husband basically eats here 5 times a week so it's about time I gave them a 5 star review lol always fresh, yummy food. Keep it up Manna's!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Manna today and absolutely loved it. The restaurant is located in a little strip mall, but the inside is decorated nicely and is impeccably clean. There was only one person working; an older gentleman who I assumed was the owner. He was very friendly and after taking our order, we chatted while with him while he hand-prepared all our food. It was nice to see the fresh ingredients being made specifically for our order. We did have to wait about 20 minutes while our food cooked but I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. When we got our order (a chicken kabob bowl and a Philly cheese steak calzone) we couldn't have been happier. Everything was hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious. Nothing was overspiced and everything was cooked to perfection. About half-way through our meal, the owner stopped by again to make sure everything tasted okay. When you factor in the price, it's one of the best meals for the quality. We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Manna for a couple of years now and can say it is one of the best Mediterranean food places in Vegas. Consistently great food and service! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Phenomenal eats! We highly recommend eating here! Everything we order here is simply yummy!"}
{"text":"I always order pick up from here! At least once a week.. I love their salads & hummus. Everything is fresh to order & the staff is extremely pleasant. Today I ordered a Greek salad and hummus for lunch and a Mediterranean salad to stick in the fridge for later. I always recommend this place! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Gonna keep it simple & quick.  By far the best Gyros I've had in Vegas. Gyros meat is perfectly seasoned, flavorful and tender & the pita is just heavenly.   The sampler plate is amazing...salad, hummus, chicken kabob, falafel & pita and is enough for two to share.   This place is a mom & pop hole in the wall, cheap prices but such a delightful gem.   Bottom line: Deeply satisfying, high quality & super delicious greek food. If you are in Henderson & craving some divine food. This is the place to be."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here and have been in to eat here. Delivery was super fast and really hot still. The pizza from here is really great. I really like the buffalo chicken pizza. When we are in there the lady over charged us but other then that the food was good."}
{"text":"It is my first time trying this place. I haven't really had a Mediterranean food type before but a new place to be. Awesome food and outstanding service. A must try restaurant if you haven't tried Mediterranean food yet. I would definitely recommend this place to other people seeking to try \"Shawarma\". It is really good...."}
{"text":"I just ordered their food for delivery and it was delicious!!! The service was great as well, they were very accommodating with my order. Will be my weekly places for orders."}
{"text":"Hands down the best food, best variety & best price. I love that they have vegetarian and vegan options as well. Makes catering all of our work events so much easier. Manna has become our #1 choice for catering and personal lunches for our facility. The service is phenomenal. Incredibly friendly and caring. It's like sharing a meal with your own family.  We support local and adore these guys!"}
{"text":"always fresh and delicious.  if you want great medditerian. food this is the place for you. try the fillet mignon dinner, its a winner.  nothing I do not like here"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times food was okay ,today while ordering seeing roach on the floor will not be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for their lunch special.  Very good gyros...Didn't try anything else.  Everything looked good.  Reasonable lunch specials.   My only issue with Manna Taste of Mediterranean is it's location.  You would either have to be in the area of Gibson and the 215 or be specifically headed there.  Otherwise kind of out of the way."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. The lady who took the order was not friendly. There was a sign that said \"ask me how to get free meal\". So I asked. She was silent, so I asked again. The she gave me a stamp card. I bought two lunches, and asked her if she could stamp two. She refused because the two gyros I bought were on the same receipt...  Although the gyro tasted like a gyro, Meat was good, sauce is sub par (too watery, bland flavor). Less than good service.  Three stars"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. They've changed their menu a little bit since i started coming here. They've added pizza and added bowls which is a great option if you want less food instead of getting a plate.  Their chicken is very good! I've been to so many Mediterranean and Greek restaurants and this is the only place I've ever tried garlic sauce from and it's so great with their chicken.  If you like garlic,  you have to try this garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Me and my family loves this place.  The food is authentic, tastes good, and is fresh. The service and attitude of the family that works there is always welcoming.  The atmosphere is very simple, but, sometimes that's all you need.  They are always accomodating to me and my daughter's food allergies and don't upcharge for changes.  I am Lebanese and am discriminating about middle eastern food; there are more options that have recently opened in the Henderson area, but this is still my favorite."}
{"text":"A decent gyro and fries close to the car dealerships. Most of their bad reviews have to do with the Italian food, so we didn't try it. The gyros were good though. Stick with the Greek food!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my boyfriend today. We've been to many other Mediterranean places but thisAll I could say as I walked out the door was, Wow!. My boyfriend ordered the falafel with French fries, and I proceeded to order the spicy gyro with a salad. The taste of the spicy gyro and salad as well was absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of spice and the right amount of dressing on the salad. Our appetizer was the hummus and it was amazing!! Would definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I ordered the gyro and chicken salad.  They were both pretty good.   I stopped by because of the ad on the front of the building showing Shwarma.  Unfortunately, it was friday 5pm and they were sold out until Monday?  three days with out having one of their big advertised items?  The guy at the front desk is not friendly.  Seems to really not like his job, may be related to the owners and forced to work there??!? I decided to come back and see if they had Shwarma - Tuesday, and they had it.  I ordered the Shwarma, took it home only to be disappointed.  It was very dry, hard to find any sauce, and wrapped in a stale pita. I have had better Shwarma from a stand at the Mall.  I will not be coming back for Shwarma here."}
{"text":"Good food and great prices, the original lamb gyro is really delicious. Great service."}
{"text":"I'm really disheartened to have to write this because I love their Greek food however their customer service has left me lacking. I placed an order through Yelp for two Greek meals and three kids meals or chicken finger meals. 20 minutes after my order was placed I get a email that they're going to cancel it so I called them and they tell me that they don't have enough food to make the chicken finger meals and if they can instead replace it with a large cheese pizza. I say yes and head over thinking that by the time I get there my food will be ready. They didn't even start my food until 30 minutes after I ordered it which is when I arrived. Then I was charged $17 for a small pizza which says $8 on their menu.... even if they had given me the large I still would have paid a $4 difference...we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice through UberEats now and have been really happy with my meal both times. I may have to stop being lazy and make it over to this restaurant myself sometime soon.   Both times I've ordered the Kefta Plate and added a Veggie Skewer. The portion for the plate is generous and includes two pieces of kefta, rice, green salad, tahini, and pita. The kefta has a great flavor and is moist without being greasy. The salad has a nice tasting dressing and the tahini is delicious too. The pita has always been very soft and flavorful. The veggie skewer has a nice variety of vegetables with the mushroom being my favorite part. Great food and nice portions. I'll definitely be ordering again, especially since I can usually make this into two meals."}
{"text":"I will not return. For the third time, I ordered a falafel with NO TOMATOES to go, confirmed with the person who handed me my food that no tomatoes were involved, then returned home to find tomatoes. The first time, I just threw it out because I did not have time to return (allergic - can't just take them off - and told them this when I ordered.) Second time I went back and they had just run out of falafel so they could not re-make my food. I got a schwarma instead and did not like it. Just got home and yet again there are tomatoes in my falafel sandwich! I called to tell them I would not be back and then got on Yelp. Absolutely ridiculous that they have not once made me a falafel sans tomatoes yet I have ordered it 3 times! Plus prices went up $1 since last time! So I have now spent almost $20 on falafel there and the only thing I even ate from those orders was a fatty schwarma."}
{"text":"Amazing food! My first time visiting and ordering through the Yelp app, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes things are not as good the 2nd time around. I first became aware of Manna at the San Gennaro Feast when after wandering around food purgatory, the scent of their food saved me. I loved their food  then and was looking forward to checking out their main location on Gibson Rd. just North of the I-215.   When I walked in I was the only customer. There was a man and woman sitting at a table talking and the man got up when I came in and went behind the counter. I placed my order for Garlic Chicken (Shawarma), a side of fries and a fountain drink. Nothing too adventurous, stick with the relative safe stuff was the mindset.   I have a problem with merchants that make you sign debit card receipts for purchases under $25. Manna is one of those places who hasn't figured out that you don't have to do this anymore. But moving past the pet peeve I'm handed a drink cup and turn to the fountain...which is disgusting. It's sitting on a stainless steel counter which makes it easy to clean. But this was not clean, far from it. I wish I had snapped a picture of it to illustrate the problem. I managed to carefully make my drink and look around for any utensils...those are up by the main counter and not logically placed at all. And there are no napkins to be found. None. So I grab what I can and look for a table to sit at.   My table choices are ick, ickier, and no, I don't think so. Does anyone know how to wield the almighty wash cloth or sponge here? Doesn't seem like it. I find a table that has minimal ick and have a seat. My food arrives pretty quick...as it's being prepared I see two guys in the back, one of them sharpening knives and then carving my chicken on the spot so this looked good. But what came to my table was boring food! Garlic chicken? I didn't taste ANY garlic in my food. None. And the chicken was also dry. Thank goodness for the fries, as they were just as good as the ones I had at the San Gennaro Feast. They kept me from going hungry and having a flavorless lunch.   This place represents my fear of trying new places in a nutshell. I get the courage up to go in and try something new...and then I get bleech, unmemorable food. While I was sitting there the guy working the counter stepped outside and looked at his Open sign It was on, but I knew why nobody was coming in. When the guy working the counter leaves dirty trays and half eaten food sitting on top of the trash can while he watches South Park, and the food they served seems to have missed out on any kind of spices much less garlic it becomes quite clear they've got problems.   How this place stays in business is a testament to divine intervention. It's a guardian angel keeping this place open, not the quality of their food. At least the guardian angel keeps you from needing the kaopectate afterwards. If you dare to try it I don't suggest leaving a tip, bring them a clean sponge or pack of dish cloths instead.   1 star: The french fries earned it, nothing else did."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast and friendly delivery. Will be ordering again soon. The hummus is a must have. Grape leaves, veggie kabobs, falafels, gyro plate...all were great."}
{"text":"Great place, the guy behind the counter is so friendly and personable...we like him. We have eaten here several times and it is consistant, clean and tasty. I get the spicy gyro and will always get it...love it."}
{"text":"Great gyros and grape leaves!! By far, the best Mediterranean food in Vegas/Henderson. The service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"It's about time I tried this Mediterranean joint I've passed many times before.  Tonight, I finally decided to try Manna.  It's located in a strip mall with other eateries like Subway, Roberto's, etc.  Here's what I thought about this place:  AMBIANCE:  Well, what can I say...there was nothing that distinguished the inside of Manna from a Roberto's a couple of doors down.  Small tables around the restaurant.  At the back of the restaurant, there's a glass case big enough for lots of trays of desserts.  Unfortunately there was 4 trays top, which took up less than half the case.  I'm going to blame it on the fact that it was early in the evening.  FOOD:  I got the chicken kabobs (grilled chicken breast, long grain rice, flat bread and Greek salad) for $9.95, shish kabobs (ground seasoned beef grilled, long grain rice, flat bread and Greek salad) for $9.95 and the fried zucchini (deep fried zucchini chips, served with a marinara sauce) for $3.99.  The chicken was moist and seasoned lightly.  The rice was a little oily and having the flat bread gives another texture component.  The salad was served with a Greek vinaigrette.  Although the shish kabobs were served with the same sides.  The ground beef, although flavorful, was a little dry.  The zucchini was super crunchy and offered a lot of texture to the dish.  The marinara sauce was really runny, so when I dipped the zucchini chips, nothing really stayed on the chip.    All in all, the place was a good choice for dinner.  For being a fast food joint, Manna did make a delicious meal.  Kudos for the quick and tasty!"}
{"text":"BEST BEEF/LAMB SHWARMA EVER! Just moved to the area and found my favorite joint!"}
{"text":"My top 3 budget meals in my Henderson 'hood (no particular order): - Manna - eg Gyro + fries or salad + drink + tax for less than $10 - Gata Thai - $6.95 lunch combo served daily 11 am - 3 pm - Village Pub - steak + happy hour booze is a bargain  Service is always friendly here and I've enjoyed the 2 dishes I've tried so far.  Looking forward to trying more."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I have been eating here for 5 years.  The food is fantastic, especially the chicken, pita and the hummus.  We usually order the platters or salads, but everything we have ever had it delicious.  I stop here anytime I am on that side of town."}
{"text":"Gross, gross, gross.  All the tables were sticky and disgusting.  When I asked for napkins to clean the table (they were behind the counter), the male employee gave me ONE.  After I specified that the table was really dirty.  He really should have offered to wipe it down for me, but instead, I was handed a single napkin.  Incredible.  The food wasn't good.  My gyro meat was chewy and dry, like it had been left out or something.  I actually couldn't eat it.  My side was a Greek salad, which was (for the lack of a better term) soupy.  There was so much dressing that it made a mess of my plate and all the lettuce was soggy.   If you're nearby and want to have some (much better) Greek food, try The Great Greek."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a few times & finally got around to giving it a try tonight. We called to see if they had a menu somewhere online after unsuccessfully trying to find it ourselves. They gave us their web address which I also added to the business info above.   Anyway, hubby ordered the Philly Cheesesteak b/c he wasn't in the mood for mediterranean food but was still happy to pick it up for me to satisfy my craving (awww!) I decided to try the Combo plate which according to the website gives you a choice of  \"any two items of Chicken, Beef, Shish Kabob or Gyro\" along with salad rice & pita. Perfect b/c I like to have leftovers the next day for lunch. I wanted the chicken & beef & I guess the guy then said \"shish kebob?\" to which my husband replied yes.  Hubby went & picked up the food, got home & I opened my box to find Kefta kabobs. Hubby called them back to say you gave us the wrong thing & that he needed to come back & pick up the right thing. I guess the misunderstanding stemmed from when the employee asked if he wanted the shish kabob & us not realizing that the kabob is only kefta. Why he asked him shish kabob? after hubby clearly ordered the chicken & beef combo plate makes little to no sense but whatever. The misunderstanding was worked out & they handled it nicely, apologized & gave us what we should have gotten the 1st time.   The food was pretty good. Nicely seasoned & well cooked. It came with Caesar salad which I thought was odd. I much prefer a greek style salad. Hubby's Philly was just ok but what do you expect from a mediterranean place? lol   All in all it was a good meal despite the mix-up & I'm sure we will order from them again. They are really close to our house which also made the mix-up a little easier to deal with, & it's great to have a place like this nearby for a quick, tasty & somewhat healthy meal when I don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh, hot and delicious. Portions are hearty and prices are very reasonable. The lady who does everything from take the order to cook the food is super sweet. You order and pay at the counter and she brings it out. It's a small casual dining room. They offer take out and delivery too!!!"}
{"text":"Go to this place for amazing Mediterranean food!! Friendly owners, short wait, and the dishes are fresh and flavorful. I particularly like the kabobs and the chicken gyro. You absolutely need to order the hummus. It's hand-made every day and is extremely rich and creamy. Honesty, it's the best hummus I've ever had and I've been to the Middle East and Greece. I've been going to this place weekly for a little over a year now and the quality and experience is still excellent. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot, but then they lost it somehow, food was not as good, so I stopped coming for a few months. Recently my son picked up couple of dishes and there were really good, and today he picked up a greek salad for me with grilled chicken and it's superb. Chicken is so flavorful, feta cheese, tomatoes, cucumber and everything else on my salad including the dressing was perfect. I am glad THEY ARE BACK! I cant wait to have lunch here again."}
{"text":"Literally the worst experience I've ever had since moving here in 2007. First off it took 40 minutes for them to cook a chicken kebab plate and a gyro plate. They told us that they ran out of rice so we opted for fries, but when we got our plates they had rice. I'm assuming it was frozen left overs that they heated up because it sure tasted like that. The chicken was undercooked and tasted a bit off.Everything was mediocre and could have been better if it wasn't cold. The cooks seemed very confused as to what was going on and didn't know what needed to be cooked. I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are tons of other options if you head closer to sunset station area. The little extra drive will be worth it for sure."}
{"text":"I seriously LOVE this place! My friend and I ALWAYS order the steak and shrimp kabob combo! We used to go to a school nearby and this was our go-to spot what felt like a daily thing. The garlic sauce is the best ever! The owners are always there working and I love that too...it gives you that mom and pop feel. Everything is so flavorful! The place is always clean. Come to Manna...it'll hit the spot and your Mediterranean cravings will be sufficed."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great food and amazing service.  Kids love the pizza and I love chicken or gyro Greek salad or gyro pita!  Everything is homemade including the hummus which is awesome.  I like to have them make it spicy!"}
{"text":"Okay...this place is becoming a bit less good. I think with the bad times the quality of food is slipping...as much as I'd love for this place to stay in business, they must do so by getting their food back to their old standards, since their prices are already on the high side for an average lunch eater on lunch break.  Last couple times I was here and ordered to go, I was given Styrofoam containers that had old grease caked in there already and gyros were lukewarm at best. Hummus was also not as fresh as I came to like it from here. I did still like the falafel and the tabouli.  To be fair, it's been about 1.5 months since I came here and I'll give it a try again in the next couple of weeks and will update, but for now I'm a bit disappointed with the downward outlook of this place."}
{"text":"Great place to try.  The owners are the nicest people.  I come here all the time.  If your looking for a great Gyro this is the place you want to try.  Prices are about average for this type of food."}
{"text":"Difficult to not compare to Falaffel Drive In in San Jose but this place is just ok.  They dont have enough white sauce, falaffels too small but it was tasty enough.   I might return to try the gyro."}
{"text":"So this might be my new favorite place. Mom & Pop place. I got there around 1115 and there were already 4 tables sitting, it opens at 10 am.  I ordered the chicken kabob plate, greek salad [dressing on the side], rice and pitas.  I told 'pop' that I was trying to eat healthy so they put all the sauces on the side.  My lunch was a little under $11.  I had to take some of it  home!!! The portion sizes are huge.  They also have a TV in there where they had on the Food Network, score!    This place is not fancy, it's great for a quick lunch. The salad was amazing. Real romaine lettuce cut and washed there, it was super fresh and crunchy.  The salad might've been my favorite part.   Mom & Pop were very anxious to see how I liked the food and encouraged me to come back!  I've eaten at several Greek Restaurants in town, all were more expensive, and not nearly as good."}
{"text":"Best brick oven pizza available in Henderson, hands down!!!  Also, curiously enough, the Greek is great. You won't be disappointed.  Support your local family owned business. Great people and great food."}
{"text":"Manna had just opened next to our school in the newly bulit commercial plaza, and Theresa B. and I were meaning to check it out soon. Before we walked into the store, we noticed that they were having a deal: Buy one platter and get the second for 1/2 off. It was about 6pm, and the place was empty. The owner was on his computer, when we walked in, sitting in ordinary wood cafe-type chairs suitable for a fast food type of place. He automatically greeted us, and seemed very patient as we took our precious time browsing the menu. You can choose between just a sandwich or a platter, which includes a choice of fries or salad.  The badly-spelled menu had sections like \"Manna Traditional Favorites, Chicken, Beef and Wrap, Soup and Salad, Sides Order, and Drinks and Deserts\". The Manna Traditional section has items like the original gyro, chicken gyro, a sampler platter (hummus, tabbouleh, chicken kebab, gyro meat, falafel), gyro burger, and meat balls. The Chicken section has items like garlic chicken, chicken caesar, and chicken kabob. The Beef and Wrap has items like Beef Kabob, Beef Kefta, Mediterranean Burger, Falafel, and Vegetarian wrap. The Soup and Salad section has items like the Mediterranean Salad, and Tabbouleh (mix of chopped parsley, tomato, cracked wheat, extra virgin olive oil, and fresh lemon juice). The Sides section includes hummus, french fries, and grape leaves (mix of rice, beef, lemon wrapped in grape leaves! YUM!) The Drinks and Deserts (Desserts! hehe) section has Calcium Broth (Milk, Banana,Strawberry, Honey), Energy Drink (Carrot, Orange, Apple), rice pudding, baklava, and Airan (Homemade Yogurt).  Theresa B. and I decided on the Original Gyro and the Chicken Gyro sandwiches. The Original Gyro had grilled charbroiled beef and lamb topped with fresh red onion (very fresh!), tomato, tzatziki or Manna sauce. Surprisingly, after suspecting the lamb to smell and have the weird taste that I am not a big fan of, the lamb tasted very good. It didn't have that intense lamb smell. However, as I ate the lamb by itself without all the condiments with it, I could definitely taste the lamb, very subtle though...Ehhhh....The onions were so fresh too! I really needed to pop gum into my mouth or brush my pearlies after that!  The owner and associate were very nice, and asked our opinion about the food. They told us that it gets very busy at lunch time.   I would definitely try their Falafel, Mediterranean Burger/Gyro Burger, baklava, grape leaves, among other things the next time...  *Could be a little pricey for Greek/Mediterranean food...  Here are some other things you might want to know:  If you want to pick up, call 15 minutes in advance.  They deliver: Minimum order is $20 w/ a limited area; $2 delivery charge  Catering is also available."}
{"text":"Best Greek food always so fresh! Prices are good too very consistent in quality taste love that it's family atmosphere"}
{"text":"I have been curios to try this place out. It had been forever since had a gyro and was craving one so figured I'd give it a try. Glad I did. It's a small place and it's for sure a mom and pop joint. The gyro was excellent. I'm very curious to try some of he other food now as it looked pretty good. I will be back in the future"}
{"text":"This restaurant was not that bad,  I usually go get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the restaurants that I am going to do review on.  I did try there lunch I ordered the Greek salad, crepe and two gyros with fires. It was a little bit high priced but still got it. When I got home the gyro and fires was great. Crepe was hit from the pass when I went to Pairs, France. But salad was alright.  I went back to try the breakfast recommend by the owner. So I went to get breakfast. Their hours was on yelp said on Saturdays 7am - 11pm. So I went at 734am there was a line of 8 people but the place was closed.  I don't think they care about the people that eat there. Let alone to keep to a standard for the business aspect of it.   Would I come back? No I would not come back to that place to eat again. Would I recommend this place? I would not recommend this place.  If people have the craving for Greek food I suggest Stefano's Mediterranean Greek food. Plus you might see an actor or two."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love gyros and these guys make the best gyro i have had in a while. Family owned and great customer service always. I am very excited to try everything in their menu for sure!!"}
{"text":"Yum! The food is great!  My family and I ordered all different meals and loved it all....lamb shwarma, chicken kabob, luleh kabob, tzatziki, hummus, tabbouleh, garlic sauce...everything fresh. The pita is amazing. I got it to go, but while waiting had a nice conversation with Papa.  Reminds me of the great Mediterranean restaurants back home in Glendale, CA."}
