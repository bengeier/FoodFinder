{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in the area. The hot and sour soup is the best you'll find."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Otanis in Hudson. Friendly atmosphere and the food was fantastic. My favorite is the holiday roll."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here, the service is quick and the place is clean.  Just look at the hoods above the hibachi grill.  They look like they were installed yesterday.  The sushi is also the best around.  Heinz, the owner, is a very gracious host and will likely do a shot of sake with you if you ask him.  He's got this great sake aged in a barrel for a year.  it's fantastic. I would recommend Otani's to anyone that wants to have good Japanese Hibachi food, good sushi or just go to have fun and hang out in the bar where the bartenders do a great job.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Updated to add that they now have gluten free soy sauce, so they can make your hibachi gluten-free.  Have been to the hibachi section several times with the kid and her friends, and it's always been consistently good."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The food is well prepared and authentic, I particularly enjoyed the tuna jaw. I will be returning, likely over and over again."}
{"text":"Wow, this might be my favorite restaurant in Hudson and I've been to them all. We got sushi and it was excellent. The service also was top notch, very friendly.  The inside was very nice and is deceiving since it's in a little strip mall. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great atmosphere, staff is really nice, owner is awesome.  I can't really give any reason not come here. Sushi is so good and there are not many sushi options in the area...at all...heinens??.... I also think they have broken that locations curse as on a yearly basis there has been something new in that spot, so I am so happy to see Otani stay and be thriving!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered sweet and sour chicken, general Tso chicken and shrimp fried rice. Flavor was pretty good but serving was way below what I expected for the price. The food was also barely warm. Will think twice about going back."}
{"text":"Ate here 2 years ago- what a nightmare.   I should say that the manager was a nightmare.   The food was decent (we thought), but we started off by questioning the kids meal pricing.  My son wanted an option not available in the kids meals, and the server said nothing could be done and he would have to order the adult meal- $17 for a kids meal?  No way!  So he got the chicken, but did not eat a whole lot.  Then my younger son had some off his brother's plate.  Then I tried it- completely raw!   I mean, barely cooked!   So both my 6 and 8 year old just consumed decent amounts of raw chicken.  The server's offer was to take it off the bill;   I thought 1/2 off the total bill was fair with an offer to pay any hospitable bills.  NO-  the manager came over and said she knew from the time we came in that our plan was to eat and get our bill erased because we complained about the kids meal price!  Ya, we often go places as a family and hope they serve us raw chicken so we can get something off the bill... what a great plan!    Anyway, I paid the bill and left.   I did call the owner who apologized and sent me a $30 gift card.  I just hope they have fired that manager- she was truly horrible and demeaning."}
{"text":"2 stars = \"Meh. I've experienced better.\".  That about sums up how I feel: Meh. I've experienced better. Otani offered sub-par food on my recent visit.  I was surprised, as it was packed with guests.  I ordered the Hot & Sour Soup, which was the highlight of my meal.  My mother ordered the Mushroom Soup, and it was not bad, but not great.  I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon, and it was very average/below-average; the same could be said about my sister's Chicken Udon.  My mother ordered the Filet Mignon Hibachi entree, and it was very bad.  The \"filet\" was not cooked properly, and had many pieces that were simply fat instead of meat.  The \"filet\" did not look or taste like a true filet cut, so I'm not sure about the quality of their meat.  The rice had a chemical taste, like perfume or lighter fluid.  It was a weird and overall disappointing dining experience.    This rating is only based on the items we ordered: the sushi bar was packed, and I'd like to think it's for a good reason.  If I somehow make it back, I may strictly order off of the sushi menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently went to Otani for our anniversary dinner for the first time and we will definitely be coming back. Everything was excellent, from the soup to the main dish. We had the sushi and it was fantastic. Well displayed and delicious. What really stuck with us was how fantastic the shrimp was in our meals. It was simply the most delicious shrimp we have ever had. On top of the great food the cook was a lot of fun and very entertaining. The atmosphere was pleasant as well. We have found our go to Japanese Steakhouse for the future."}
{"text":"Last night was our first visit to the new and improved Otani. I've generally been a fan of their food, but had always been put off by the somewhat cold space...and the fact that, being next to a Subway, the restaurant positively reeked of yeast.   But recently, they moved a few doors down to a space probably five or six times as large, added a full (separate) bar, greatly expanded the sushi bar, and put in three teppanyaki tabletops. New furniture and swank decor round out the upgrade, and an upgrade it most definitely is. While the previous location was serviceable but uninteresting, the new space is a destination, with an upscale atmosphere, subdued lighting, and more comfortable chairs.   But of course, the important question is, has the food changed?   The menu certainly has. Otani now offers a limited selection of Chinese and Thai dishes alongside the sushi and other Japanese fare--and, of course, they now prepare and serve hibachi.  We were there for straight-up Japanese food, though, so that's all I can speak to. The verdict: good, but not great. I've had better--and I've had MUCH worse. The fresh salmon nigiri was tender like butter, but seemed to be slightly short on flavor. Unagi nigiri was spectacularly flavored, but a tiny bit on the tough side. And unagi maki was crunchy (a nice substitute for salmon skin, which I couldn't find on the new menu), but the rice and seasonings seemed somehow bland.   I ordered a yakitori chicken appetizer to start, and was similarly whelmed. The chicken was very clearly a top-shelf cut of meat, but the meat on the skewers was almost comically overlarge, lacked any flavor of smoke or grill, and was coated in a slightly-too-sweet teriyaki glaze.   I know this doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement, but taken as a whole, Otani Hudson is a place I'm willing to give a second, third, and fourth chance to. Having tried only three types of sushi, I'm unwilling to dock the score too heavily for what may have been simply bad luck in my ordering. And considering we walked in after 9:00 pm (the restaurant is ostensibly open until 10, though it was deserted at 9), I'm willing to give the chef and the kitchen a bit of leeway.  Fortunately, the new space is inviting enough that I'm eager to give it another shot, especially since the restaurant now has daily happy hours, occasional live music, and--oh my, yes--karaoke on Wednesday nights. (And ladies: Thursday is Ladies' Night! All night!) It's more upscale than the generally spartan sushi restaurants in the area, but far less obnoxious than Sushi Rock or even Wasabi. That's pretty much the perfect spot for me.  Long story short: If you'd tried Otani before but were put off by the small space or Subway smell, rush back to see what they've done with the place. If you're looking for a new sushi joint in the area, it's a great spot for a not-overly-special occasion. Just beware that the kitchen may be working out a few kinks."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, and the outside of the restaurant looked promising, although there was only one other couple there. When we got our food, our edamame was undercooked and unsalted, and my vegan/veggie sushi was covered in my boyfriends fish eggs!!... They clearly didn't clean or wipe off anything in between making our sushi, and very clearly cross contaminated them. We Won't be coming back :("}
{"text":"This place is a gem. First, this is the only really good japanese food I have found in Northeastern Ohio. The tako salad was divine, sushi rolls were great (though it was pricey for the special rolls, they were HUGE to make up for it, and the regular sushi and rolls were average price), nabeyaki udon was almost perfect (I wish there had been more types of vegetables in it, but everything else was right), and the hibachi was flawless. Just the right portion, reasonably priced as hibachi goes, and everything tasted great (not too greasy like many hibachi places). The service was superb. I cannot recommend this place enough. Apparently, they have karaoke on Wednesdays, and I can't wait to go!  p.s. It was completely empty when we went on a Tuesday night around 8:30pm, but I hear it gets CRAZY on weekends, and there are only two hibachi tables right now, so if you want to go, I recommend you make a reservation."}
{"text":"Went to Otani in Hudson, Ohio for the first time last night, and I have to say, overall, it was a good experience! When we first walked in the door of the restaurant which is located in a small shopping plaza, (I will note that this particular plaza was not very well lit, which made finding the restaurant a little tough.) the restaurant was decorated nicely, and it was very clean. We did notice the bar area to the left. There was a sub-par band playing cover songs, to which we were kind of glad we couldn't hear from the hibachi side of the restaurant. One downside to when we arrived at the restaurant, we waited for at least 10 minutes at the door before I decided to let one of the employees know we were here for our scheduled reservation. They did apologize for the wait, and promptly seated us.     Once we were seated at the hibachi table, we noticed a pretty good sized sushi bar behind us. If you like sushi, I feel like you wouldn't be disappointed. The waitress was quick to take our drink orders and also the food order at the same time. We were then served a small bowl of miso soup of which was nice and hot when we received it.  You are also given a decent sized portion of salad, which I also thought was pretty good.     When our hibachi chef arrived, he was very personable. He introduced himself, and interacted with the people at our table. He was entertaining, and was very curious about what brought us to the restaurant for the night, all while preparing the food we ordered. The food he prepared was your standard hibachi style meal of vegetables, fried rice, shrimp, and your meat choice. I did have some special modifications to my order to which the chef made sure to take care of. The food quality was outstanding. Cooked to order, and very fresh. The quality and presentation of the food was very acceptable for the price we paid for it. We will most likely return to this restaurant. It would be a great place for birthdays, or other special occasions, and I would recommend anyone who was looking for a new place to go to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have only had sushi here and it has always been great.  I smell the hibachi when I am there and that will definitely make me try it.  Only criticism is the miso soup...I don't care for theirs."}
{"text":"Overall this is a great couple or family place to eat sushi or hibachi. They have 3 segments of the restaurant. One bar with karaoke and live music, one sushi bar and hibachi room, and one private dining room for a quiet atmosphere.  Foods great, prices are solid and freshness of fish varies. But overall very good. Chris is head sushi chef! He's the man, go see him!"}
{"text":"fresh sushi and good sized nigiri portions.  I got the yellowtail, red snapper, and sweet shrimp (ama ebi), with the fried heads, and also the spider roll. he did a twist on the fried heads that I had not had before:  spicy sauce and roe on top.  very tasty.  a bit pricey, the 4 stars are for the quality. spider roll was awesome, but again pricey for the size.  only 1 chef (chris) at work on the weds I went, due to the other guy having to fill in at the middlefield location, so it was slow. overall worth the visit, esp. for a business traveler whose company is paying."}
{"text":"one of our favorite places.  We usually only sit at the sushi bar and have Chris make us something special.  He is very good and I would say it helps to be a local.  They know us by name, will make us sushi off the menu based on what we \"feel like eating\".    Sushi is always pricey so can't comment on price expect we have been dining there for 4 years and still go back for more."}
{"text":"We were so excited to go out for hibachi. You think of these great flavors and a little bit of a show put on. Best way to describe this was mediocre, food and service. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Best sushi and sashimi in the area. All the people who gave it one or two stars got General Taos, so that should tell you why they didn't like it. I give the Kraft Mac & Cheese I made at home around 1 or 2 stars. I prefer to eat like an adult, so I don't order garbage when I go to a restaurant with decent food. Try one of their signature rolls like the Hudson or the Morgan."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian cuisine we have had in the Hudson area. Found it on yelp and decided to give it a try. Our meals were great and the service was awesome. They have Hibachi, sushi, and other Asian dishes. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Going early to lunch I had a tasty sampling of sushi that was spot on in flavor. No cheaper than at dinner time but them Hudson doesn't seem to have and lunch specials. Nice staff and lovely environment."}
{"text":"This is the ULTIMATE sushi restaurant!  I've been going here ever since I was a little kid. I love this facility, the employees and of course the sushi. I recommend the salmon roll with the raw quail egg cracked on top!"}
{"text":"BRUTALLY overpriced sashimi for the quality. I paid $25 dollars for chirashi thinking it would be overflowing with different and high-quality fish. Nope. Four pieces of your garden variety fish (tuna, salmon, albacore, and yellowtail) with some tomago, ikura and avocado. I was stunned. If you charge that much for chirashi, you should be including scallop, spanish mackerel, snapper, etc. to make it worth the charge.   The salad that came with the chirashi was browning on the edges and covered in what I assume was simply mayonnaise with some ginger in it. Awful.   I will be returning to try the teppanyaki, but I will never eat sushi here again."}
{"text":"Just had to state how good of a meal I had. Last time I went with the family and this time I sat by myself at the sushi bar. Great chef. Truly experienced and understands fish!! I want to compliment the staff for always being friendly and sincere. Job well done!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in northeast Ohio. Chris is a sushi wizard. We go here at least once a month and it's always superb. The Morgan roll is a must order; all the special rolls are amazing and they have the best Hamachi around. Normally we order sushi, but we did do the Hibachi once and it did not disappoint. Really hope that they don't fall to the curse of this location."}
{"text":"Just fantastic!  If you go, do yourself a favor and try the Hudson and Electric Eel rolls. We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Their sushi is delicious. Master chef quality rolls...cut and rolled with perfection. You can tell the chef is a master. Fresh and well priced.  These aren't tiny rolls either! Highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Been here twice and while the sushi and people are great, I have to give it 3 stars for an odd reason; the place has a faint unappealing odor.  I think this is why there have been something like 7 different restaurants in this place over the last 12 years.  I remember the smell when the place was Glass Gardens, and when it was Emillo's.  Not the fault of the people who invest money and time to open and run a place, but must have something to do with the building.  If not for the odor, I would give this 4 stars, no question.  I hope the landlord can correct the issue because I like to support local, independent businesses and I like the food here."}
{"text":"One of the better hibachi/sushi places around. Reasonable prices, nice selection, really friendly staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while in the area. The décor was not your typical sushi bar setup as there is a bar on one side and a hibachi/dining area on the other.  Opted for the miso soup which was on the larger side and had a nice flavor. I requested the Volcano and Rainbow rolls. It took nearly half an hour to get them. When they finally arrived I was surprised at this size as both were huge, but sadly this was mostly rice.   The Rainbow Roll was not properly compressed and the entire roll kept falling apart as I picked it up and was difficult, due to the size, to eat each piece in one bite which lead to it further coming apart on the plate. It also used previously frozen tuna which did not have much flavor.  It was almost impossible to taste the filling for the Volcano Roll as it was covered by a very large amount of mayonnaise (which in the menu was listed as baked sauce). I had to scrape of spoonful's to make it palatable and in the end I did not even bother to finish.  It is obvious that whomever made the rolls has had little training in proper technique which would have prevented the rolls coming out over dressed and under-formed."}
{"text":"The sushi is the best I've had. Chris is awesome and the whole place has the charm of a small family restaurant.  The ambience has gone downhill since they moved into the new place. I could do without the live music and the hibachi tables. The loss of the crayon sushi menu on the wall was a loss to the charm.  The food is still every bit as good but if they could somehow revert to the old location, I would go as often as I used to go."}
{"text":"The service was subpar at best , the rice wasn't cooked all the way. I asked for extra shrimp I was shorted the extra shrimp until I complained about it . The cook was polite but just so so.. I am not an angry customer just want my hibachi experience to be better than what I was given .( I came for lunch, so dinner could be different )"}
{"text":"Really fresh, delicious sushi! We just moved from Chicago where we used to eat sushi all of the time, and Otani either matches or beats the places we used to go. So happy to have Otani in Hudson!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, great atmosphere, staff, and food. The sushi was incredible, the volcano roll was to die for. Our food came fast, and was exactly as ordered, had high expectations and they met every one of them!"}
{"text":"As you walk in your greeted perfectly. I felt very comfortable here. The party I was with felt comfortable. We asked to sit at the Hibachi tables which were not busy at all. The chefs are fun and make it enjoyable. The service was quiet and respectful. When they answer the phone they answer the phones professionally. Their soup is fantastic. The last time we where their I had the chicken and my partner had the chicken as well. We both enjoyed it. This time around we shared the steak. We both enjoyed it. This time we were there with family and they too enjoyed it. They enjoyed it so much their was tea everywhere. They were very helpful when the tea was spilled. Two couples shared a dish and they were totally okay with that. They even offered an additional salad as the meal only came with one. The salad was on them. Nice Easter gift. Even though the  people we were with did not get the chefs jokes the chef continued professionally."}
{"text":"Had the sweet and sour fish. Wife had tempura veggies. Both were excellent. Extensive menu. Good prices. Moving soon to new location a few stores down. Will have a hibachi grill. Can't wait."}
{"text":"Went to Otani for my girlfriends birthday dinner. Excellent food and service! The Hibachi chef was very nice and made sure everything was cooked exactly how we liked it. Prices are pretty high, a lot higher than any other Japanese steakhouse I've been to but the food is well worth it. I'll be back again. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I actually give it a 2.8 I rounded up based off the lunch i had so it could be bias. I only had the sushi bar . My nigiri pieces were great, fish was good, fresh with large pieces. Now for the reason for 2.8 stars. Little pricey but that doesn't bother me to much. The spider roll I had was pretty bad. The roll job was very poor, the roll had a ton of rice in it and the smallest bit of soft shell crab almost as skinny as a pencil. Very disappointing since the roll was 18 bucks. I will try the place again maybe for the dinner service."}
{"text":"Great place! Get there early on a Friday night.  If you have the Entertainment Card, you can use the BOGO free option over & over!  The card that pays for itself at this place!  I LOVE their dressing!  I always get the shrimp flambe and the chicken & steak meal.  For desert, they give you sorbet and and a fortune cookie.  No refills on soft drinks."}
{"text":"My husband and I simply can't find better sushi ANYWHERE! The jalapeño papa is addicting. Jason usually makes it and it never fails to satisfy the craving. The sushi chefs are very creative. Will make anything you want just ask. If you don't know what you want let them surprise you with their artistic abilities. So so good!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Hudson!  My boyfriend and I went for lunch at Otani's and we were seated immediately with no wait.  I was surprised by how modern it was inside.  I had a spider maki roll and chicken and shrimp hibachi.  My boyfriend had the filet mignon hibachi.  The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food.  Only down side to this place was the service.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great.  There were not very many people and our waiter took awhile to get our order and refill drinks. The food was fantastic and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First clue should have been was located in strip-mall. Disappointed in that this might be the first Asian restaurant that did not know how to cook chicken breast. Asian restaurants being known for their tender chicken, these guys missed the boat. Over cooked and tuff! Like grandpa cooked on his grill with grandma harping not to under-cook it! Did the Hibachi dinner at the table since was alone and didn't want to do the whole table-top cook experience. Might have been my mistake. Fried rice was meh!, salad way too chilled and right out of the bag. I would definitely do the chains Benihana or Ichiban before I would go back for Hibachi here. That said...Lots of regular locals seem to like the place and their Sushi. Atmosphere was very informal, not very cozy. Service was good and very friendly. Was glad to have left before Karaoke started at 8pm. Wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"We went to otani last Saturday, the food was delicious here. I love owner, she's so hospitable. We enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"I love smashing sushi ... Unfortunately this just didn't do it for me.   Ambiance: we grabbed an early lunch & the restaurant wasn't packed at all so not much to report out.  Service: staff was friendly. The guy behind the sushi counter was really nice and attentive to our needs.   The sushi was nicely presented however a little bland. Service was and ambiance were fine, nothing out of the ordinary.  Food: I wish I could say I loved the food but I'd be lying. It wasn't bad by any means. However once you've had great sushi it's hard to go back on \"ok\" or \"good\" sushi. Presentation of food was beautiful but overall taste was bland."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place after seeing previous reviews and hearing good things about it from friends. However, my personal experience was less than optimal.  My first clue should have been the 4 minute wait in front of the hostess stand before someone acknowledged our presence and took us to a table.   Once we were seated, we noticed that the restaurant was busy, but not overly crowded. Shortly after we were seated, a fairly pleasant waitress came over to take our beverage order. The beverages came out in a very reasonable amount of time, which I thought was a good sign of things to come. It was at this time that we placed our entree order.   After ordering, we sat for a full 59 minutes before our food arrived. Throughout this entire waiting period, our beverage glasses were only filled once - having sat empty for 20 minutes at a time.   When the food finally arrived, it was extremely underwhelming. The General Tso's chicken was not the least bit spicy. In fact, it was quite bland - to the point where I considered adding salt.   Bottom line - from what I'm reading, it appears to be the place to go for sushi. Other than that, don't bother."}
{"text":"We had habachi table reservations for 5 people and when we arrived we were seated at a regular table.  We had to wait a half hour until a table cleared but did get to the habachi table.  However the 5 of us were crammed along the short side of the table and a family of 4 was seated on the linger side.  The chef was routine and the food was average.  Probably a one and done experience."}
{"text":"They recently moved a few doors down to a larger establishment and the addition of the Hibachi Grills tableside are a HUGE plus.  Unfortunately, with the larger (but much nicer) building, prices have also risen slightly.  I'm very glad to see that the  new larger force of waitstaff are all just as nice, courteous, and attentive to the customers needs as they were at the old location.   We arrived for dinner at 7:30pm and it was a little crowded, and thus the delicious custom made sushi took a little longer than we would've liked, but it was still a great experience.  Still a huge fan of Otani's of Hudson and now an even better place to bring the family to enjoy a nice night out at the Japanese steakhouse."}
{"text":"Had a 6:30 reservation at hibachi table and they double booked and could not seat us and did not care"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.. Double sided; one side a bar with seating for dining as well with live music. The other side is a dining room with hibachi grills, sushi bar, and table seating. Service was great and the food was delicious! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Otani is a nice Japanese style restaurant. The Sushi is fresh although not terribly too Creative. The Hibachi part of the restaurant is very tiny, and doesn't seem to have as much energy as other Hibachi restaurants do. I had the udon noodles, and I found them to be very Enjoyable. We were sitting by the front door, and every time somebody came into or left the restaurant a cold breeze would blow across us. Overall, this is a solidly average restaurant , worthy of a try but probably not worthy of a second visit."}
{"text":"I can check this off my list.. been here, done that and probably won't be back!  Went here for a bday dinner on a Saturday night. It wasn't too packed but busy enough.  We had a party of 12. A few of us ordered sushi and everyone else ordered a dish. I ordered 2 rolls. Everyone got and finished their dinner before I even received my first roll. You would think mid way through my dinner the server would come and check on me to see if everything was fine or to atleast tell me my 2nd roll was on the way.. Sadly he didnt. I ordered a dynamite and a volcano roll. The rolls were huge only because it was all rice and very little fish.  We sat down at 7 and were finished by 930. The entire restaurant was cleared out.  The only reason I rated this 3 stars is because the place does have a good atmosphere.. it was clean, nice, and a good location. I also gave it another point for having live music."}
{"text":"Its actually a decent place. Its smallish and quiet. The decor is nice and new looking. Chefs are funny and enjoyable. The food is good as well. A lot of Hibachi grille's are loud and crowded. It does not feel like a special occasion upscale dining establishment when its that loud and cramped. Otani's only has I think two actual hibachi tables. The rest are traditional tables that order from the traditional menu. I have been there a few times and they are always very nice. They seem to actually care about the customer rather than the money coming from the customer. In a time when Hibachi grill chains are as numerous as McDonald's Otani's stands out. I have also read that someone complained that their food was undercooked. I have never had that problem. I have also read that the staff gave difficulty when it was asked that a change be made or something different was ordered. Two parties in our group shared meals. They had no problem with that.  And when one meal was shared the server understand and offered another salad or soup.... on the house... out of the kindness of their heart. Normally a meal is supposed to be for one person and comes with one soup or salad. I won't say their name just in case they were not supposed to do that. But it was a really nice thing to do. They also said it was because we went on a holiday. That was really really nice. Just made the meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon Otani by mistake as the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed. We sat at the bar (which is happy hour all night on Mondays) and ordered a few drinks and sushi. The sushi was amazing! He got the volcano roll and I got the red back spider roll. Both were very delicious. Best of all, our bartender was very sweet and attentive. Great service and great food, my only complaint is that it is a little overpriced for the portions that you get."}
{"text":"Great food. Sushi menu is extensive as is the Chinese and Thai. If it comes out of eastern Asia you can probably find it at Otani. My favorite dish is the Thai curry beef! Wow! Also there is a Hibachi bar which is great fun. Otani's also has a bar side with Karaoke on Wednesdays and live music on Fridays and Saturdays. And of course, Pete Murdough shows up!!!"}
{"text":"terrible service, came in the door without anyone meet you for more than 15 min. Finally got a table, there is only one waitress , waited more than 45 min, dishes are not coming, still waiting here for our food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and wish it was closer to where I live so I could frequent it more often.  Hubby and I sat at the Sushi bar for lunch and got to chat with the sushi chef while he created our orders.  It was a WONDERFUL lunch experience.  Everything was so fresh and tasty.  I never had to ask for a drink refill and the service for everything else was just fantastic.  Everyone was patient as I asked questions and super friendly.  The place was clean and neat and there is plenty of parking out front.  I have to come back sometime and experience dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to hudson and I wanted to say how great the food and people are here. The fish is fresh and the help is sincere and helpful. Thank you for a great experience to one of my first places to eat at here in hudson."}
