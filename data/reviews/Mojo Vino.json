{"text":"Soooo average. I saw the property change over and finally decided to visit. The food wasn't bad, but I expected more choice and expected lower prices (they seemed to be priced as appetizers at any other place). I can understand wanting to stay a little more upscale, but isn't the whole idea of a tapas place to order a bunch of different foods and try a bit of everything?"}

{"text":"No longer Pimentos!
Now known as Mojo Vinos.
Same owners with a new look inside!

Had a fairly good experience.

Place looks good and was hoping for more of \"wow factor\"
Nothing \"wow\" about it.. 
Tapas menu with only a few items. Tasted good (we ordered all the tapas to share)
Wine list was limited and downtown Toronto priced, sadly.
Service was extremely slow and had to flag waitress several times for refills of drinks :(

I imagine that if this keeps up it won`t be around for long.
Might go back... Might not."}
