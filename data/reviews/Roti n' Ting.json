{"text":"Fantastic flavours with everything on the menu. Cheap and delicious lunch Roti, but their chickpea doubles are a real treat."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this place and have only tried the SHARK & BAKE here.  The shark pieces were large and chunky, slightly crispy batter and salt marinaded.  There are also diced veggie pieces and sauce.  Simple but extremely delicious!  We have been here twice so far and both times were consistently the same = delicious!

We ran into another diner who had the another salted fish wrap and said it was yummy too.

As someone else mentioned, there are only two fourseater tables and the decor is like a warehouse, but this is more of a takeout place.

Treat this like a quick takeout place and go for the food, period!

Two thumbs up (for the Shark Bake at least)!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of great food and great service.  Goat Roti and 2 Doubles al the way. Healthy food on top of that."}
{"text":"This is the place I go when my wife and I crave chicken roti.  The staff are very friendly.  The chicken roti is very tasty and not greasy like some others I have tried.  I would prefer it to be a bit meatier and less potato like I Love Roti but I still come back for more.

I have also had the jerk chicken on multiple occasions.  It's got a good jerk flavour to it with a good amount of spiciness.  It comes with a different take on coleslaw.  It's not the usual refrigerated, creamy slaw that I normally see.  It's a bit of a warm slaw with beans.  It's hard to describe but it's good.

The last time I went, I decide to go with the curry chicken on rice.  It's pretty much the chicken and potatoes that they use for the roti, on top of rice and beans.  Good portion and tasty.

With a ridiculous number of similar places in Pickering, this continues to be our go to place."}
{"text":"Chicken Roti is terrible. Very poor cuts of chicken. Cartridge and bone. Definitely not choice chicken breast meat."}
{"text":"Been here once and found it to be okay. The chicken roti was so dry but the curry flavour was delicious. Too bad."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place quite a bit. If you're looking for a great Caribbean lunch this is the place to go to. 

 Due to the location of the business, there aren't too many chairs for you to sit in and eat but you have the option. The price of the Roti is pretty cheap with the lunch special. The menu is actually pretty generous, with a good amount of options for your lunch or dinner. 

 The workers are all awesome, friendly and hardworking. This family run restaurant is super awesome, and in my opinion better than I Love Roti, but try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"First of all, this place is tucked into an obscure corner in a Pickering plaza opposite a McDonalds, and sandwiched (I couldn't resist the pun) between a Japanese restaurant and a haircut place. However, parking is usually plentiful and this place serves up some great take-out food.
You probably do not want to eat in there, as there is little space, but the food is 5 star! The service has always been friendly.
The Roti (signature dish) are substantial and nicely spiced. However, the Doubles are my go-to order here: like a smaller, sandwich version of Roti! If you are in the Pickering area and craving Roti (and have a place to eat your meal after you've received your order), then I recommend that you check this place out! If you have a light appetite, the doubles are superb."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite carribean food spots in pickering. Its a small place with very good food & value. Its features really make it a hidden gem for food with flavor. One of those spots that's so good, You'd hear about it by word of mouth from locals. Amazing to have this within the community."}
{"text":"Amazing, always boneless roti. I have always wanted to try their Saltfish and Bake but they only do it on weekend mornings. They also have shark and bake on the menu and even though I'm skeptical, I would probably try that too :)"}
{"text":"If your thinking about Caribbean or just GREAT FOOD for lunch, dinner or for the whole family; this is the place you NEED to come to.

I started coming here in 2016 on a regular bases while working for Goodlife and I have to say, this is the BEST restaurant for Roti, curry goat , or any other Caribbean food item you desire.

But don't take my word for it, stop reading and CALL THEM NOW!
View the menu on the following pictures and order, you won't me disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Rotis here are pretty solid. One of the better places I've been to. Staff are friendly and the prices are reasonable. The lunch sized roti is the perfect size!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice Roti. Fresh and hot.  Not my favorite, but in the top 5 in Durham.  I'm hakka but I'm surprised all these places still serve Chinese food."}
{"text":"During my first foray working in Pickering years ago, Roti N Ting was a mainstay for me, because their mini roti lunch specials were a tremendous deal for a filling meal.

Now that I'm back in the area, I wound up going back to see if it was still there, and if anything had changed. And nothing has, great filling food, roti is fantastic. They also do a number of other Trinidadian dishes, including shark and bake, palau, and they also make a pretty decent jerk chicken.

A safe bet for a quick cheap good feed."}
{"text":"Awesome prices and good food. Not much seating so it is probably better to go for take out. I always get the doubles as they tastes great and were 2-3$. Awesome little family business and I would totally recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Great take out roti. Goat is my favorite. The chicken, chick peas and shrimp are also great. I stop by whenever I am in the neighborhood visiting family. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a small walk-in family shop. Theres some basic seating for those who want to eat right away. 

The workers seem friendly. I bought some aloo pies. $2.00 each  They're pretty big. Two people could share one. They said it comes with tamarind chutney. Pepper sauce is optional. They wrapped each one individually and wrote P on the one that had pepper on it, which was helpful.  They tasted good. I would go again, maybe earlier on in the day when they're fresh. 

They take debit fyi.
I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great Roti!  Under new management and these two ladies make some good eats.  The   curry goat roti was terrific with just the right amount of \"hot\". Yeah!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant with only one table for eating in.  Take-out is where it's at.  Everything on the menu is delicious, except for the Chinese-type dishes (like chow mein).

You can't go wrong with the rotis (dhal puris for Guyanese people).  Get the boneless goat and ask for pepper sauce (if you can handle the heat)!"}
{"text":"I have been living in Pickering for almost 3 years and I just discovered this gem.  What took me so long? Lol

I had their pumpkin and chickpea roti and it was the bomb.  It had a light taste and it wasn't salty which is a good thing.

Price wise it's very reasonable and get good portions plus the people who run it are great.  I noticed they had so many regulars.

A must try for sure!"}
{"text":"My friends brought food from Roti N Ting into work. When I tried it, I was blown away. The roti was amazing and so flavorful. The poulari was outstanding with the very spicy cucumber sauce and the doubles we're the best I have ever had! I ordered a bunch of food to take home to my family after I was done work today. Everyone loved it! Looks like we have finally found a great roti restaurant. The service was amazing as well! Everyone was smiling and gave me such a warm welcome. They have definitely made me a regular customer now. If you love roti, you need to try this place!"}
