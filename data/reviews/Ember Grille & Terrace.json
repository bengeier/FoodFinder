{"text":"I eat here regularly while staying at the Westin.  It's a good idea to get take-out orders from here, rather than paying the $6 fee + service charge + taxes that will be added to a room service order.
- Everything on the menu is $3-4 dollars overpriced.  That's just what you should expect at a hotel restaurant.  
- The food is decent and in some cases pretty delicious (the short rib grilled cheese is great)
- The service is awful - they basically never answer the phone.  When I get downstairs, sometimes I have to wait at the hostess desk for 5 minutes before someone shows up.  Sometimes I can see the hostesses hanging out around the restaurant rather than attending to the customers.  Sometimes they will take my takeout order at the desk, but other times they have refused and told me I have to go to the bar.  Ultimately, it's a frustrating place to get bad service after a long day of work on the road."}
{"text":"Like many business travellers, I have had my fair share of overpriced, unfriendly, and unimpressive hotel restaurants.  I have had so many of those experiences that I have grown to expect them.

I went to Ember Grille for lunch on a Friday and was delighted.  The toughest part of the meal was selecting which dish to order!  The prices were reasonable, while the portions were \"lunch-size\" appropriate (AKA, small).  The pasta salad was delicate while the smoked salmon tart delighted the eye as well as the tastebuds."}
{"text":"So, I do believe that the circumstances in which you visit a restaurant ultimately count towards the experience you receive. In honor of full disclosure this is my first yelp review. Also...I had a \"Groupon\" that was set to expire on the day of attendance...and while I did put a few last minute feelers out to my besties, I ended up dining alone. A practice I used to relish but since my 10 + years of domestication have forgotten all about. 
With that said, it was inspiring. 
To be clear my groupon was for $25 bucks of experience. The rules were that I had to order two entrees, from 5-6 choices of $20-$30 entrees, all very generic hotel selections. (i.e. no local ingredients, flavors etc)  Not to be counted towards alcohol, and dine-in only. (P.S. ALWAYS read the fine print on those things!)  Luckily my outstanding server was sympathetic to my solo status and allowed a $25 credit to my total bill. 
I was not about to disappoint his coolness. I originally ordered a glass of ruffino, \"lumina\" pinot grigio (Their only \"by the glass\" pinot grigio.) @ $11. 

For Lunch ~ \"grilled beef fillet . butter whipped potatoes . sauteed mushrooms . cabernet reduction ~ $29.  I decided that a glass of the Penfolds shiraz (The only \"by the glass shiraz\")  would pair much better with my over salted \"entree\"  

The highlight of the meal was the server! I can be easily charmed by efficient, knowledgeable and attentive staff (which is why I steer clear of Nordstrom).  John was a delight. Did I mention that he raved about the Ember Grille's newest Pinot Noir and even brought me a sample. It was delicious and for your knowledge and mine it is the \" Meiomi Pinot Noir from Sonoma County.\" (He was kind enough to jot it down on a slip for me.) 

My husband & I went to the Ember Grille for the first time a few years back when they first opened. I still recall the delectable hazelnut encrusted North Carolina Trout. With so many spectacular restaurants in Charlotte and the business of life, we have not been back, although I often reference it as a great recommendation from our first experience alone. 

On this my most recent visit I can say that the seductive appeal of the local out of the box entrees were unfortunately absent from the current \"lunch\" menu.  I wonder/fear that they have decided that they are just a hotel restaurant. Perhaps that is why the groupon did not work for them and I was clearly the only one scampering to use it before the deadline.   I would call to them to see that as a hotel restaurant specifically they should highlight the local flair of their surroundings. 

Also worth noting and the reason for at bare minimum a 1.25 deduction from my score (the remaining 1.75 for the over salting and generic hotel menu lacking reasonable by the glass wine options and local flair, for which the exceptional service made up for significantly. ) the parking cost was excessive and not validated by the restaurant. It was nearly $10 at the Westin parking lot. A cruel move on the part of both parties at the sole expense of the local patrons and supporters of both businesses! (I recall distinctively that parking used to be covered by validation from the restaurant!) One can only assume that greed fueled this unfortunate change in logistics resulting in a divide between the Ember Grille ever becoming a destination for the locals and the Westin a recommendation for their visitors.  For Shame. 

P.S. I could imagine that I would have had a MUCH worse experience if I did not have such a delightful and doting server as John.  It was one of those moments where If I could only prescribe John to one of my other fave Charlotte restaurants that are in desperate need of phenomenal servers I would...a girl can dream. 

Until next time..."}
{"text":"I would freely give 5 stars if Ember Grill was not overpriced.  Love the Caesar Salad with grilled chicken added.  Also, the cream of potato soup is so good, I would ask for several bowls, but at $6 a small cup, I wouldn't dare!  The lunch bill added up quickly, $27 for iced tea, Caesar Salad with chicken, and tiny cup of soup."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant and polite, attentive servers. Our delivery of the food was a little slow but warm and delicious. For a hotel restaurant they have a nice variety and selection."}
{"text":"I had brunch here after staying at the Westin with my wife this weekend. We got the buffet because we'd heard it was very good. And the food tasted good, everyone was very nice and prompt. But for a $60 breakfast with tip, I have to say I expected something a little better.

So it's good food, but not quite worth the money they're charging."}
{"text":"This would be rated five stars if it was a little more affordable.  I had a great meal here while staying at the Westin.  The salad, entree, and desert were all delicious.  The server was very helpful and friendly and the manager came by to check how the meal was - good service."}
{"text":"Nice environment.   Only had dessert.   Very limited dessert menu.  I had the Apple Gallette upon recommendation from the hostess.  It was ok.  Took a long time to make and then it was burnt, but it satisfied my sweets craving."}
{"text":"We had Christmas brunch at Ember Grille today, and it was WONDERFUL!!!!! So many delicious offerings including seafood, meats, artisanal cheeses, breakfast foods and a fabulous dessert selection. We used to go to the brunch at Ballantyne Hotel every year, and Ember Grille is as good, if not better. Already planning to go back next year!!!"}
{"text":"Service is superb! I love all my servers.. I came down each day for breakfast and had 3 different servers.. 2 out 3 were fabulous! 

However, there was no variety in the food selection--- who wants to have the same exact breakfast every single day? Everything was the exact same unless they were out of something then they would just take that off the menu but they wouldnt replace it with anything else! 

Food was simply okay and if you were paying $20 for breakfast that has no variety, I think you are better off going to something down the street!"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of restaurants inside hotels.  They're usually overpriced and mediocre.  The Ember Grille proved me wrong!

I had won gift certificates to the Ember Grille from a contest, so we saved them and went for our anniversary.  We ordered a lot since we had a lot to spend.  The bread appetizer with hummus was delicious, but more amazing was the tuna tartare.  It was a huge mound of rare tuna cut up into tiny bite-size pieces.  I was in heaven.  Each bite was so full of flavor.  It was better than any rare tuna I've ever had.  The entrees (sea bass and chicken) were delicious, too, but I kept wishing I could just have another moundful of tuna tartare!

I'd definitely go back to the Ember Grille, but probably not unless it's a special occasion.  It can be a challenge to get to in Uptown (and find a place to park if you don't valet) and the prices are more than we like to pay regularly.  But the service and food get two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Outside dining was so delightful but the traffic was extremely loud. We had the GF ahi tuna appetizer and was a really small portion but very delicious and full of flavor. My main dish was the burger and sweet potato tater tots!!! DELISH!!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the Hotel restaurant. We had room service earlier in the week. The variety on the room service menu was better than the actual restaurant. 
Our server was disappointing, to say the least. He did not smile, he took our drink order and never asked if I wanted another until after clearing our plates away. 
Never returned to refill soda or water. When I asked what the choices were with the burger I was told \"fries!\" In a very abrupt manner. Yet, when I ordered room service I got the sweet potato tots and other reviewers on here also had the sweet potato tots. Which were quite delicious and way better than the fries. 
The food was adequate but the service was so disappointing I have to give this one three stars."}
{"text":"I am on the road practically every week for work, and one of my fundamental travel philosophies is to get out of the hotel and try to experience local restaurants. However, there are times where eating in the hotel is a necessity. 

I have dined at Ember Grille a number of times, either sitting in the restaurant itself or ordering food to-go to take back to my room. My experience has been a total mixed bag. Sometimes I am pretty satisfied with my meal and the service, other times I'm disappointed/frustrated at the lack of attention to detail. 

Service: For some reason, there tends to be a lack of presence at the front of the restaurant - sometimes I am waiting to pick up a to-go order or be seated and nobody can be found to help. I've stood around for 5-8 min sometimes before someone appears. Once seated, however, the wait staff seems to be pretty attentive. If I have a special request with my meal, they are able to accommodate. I've noticed that the kitchen tends to be on the slower side, so enjoy a drink and conversation while you wait. 

Food: I tend to order the same thing whether I am taking it up to my room or eating in - one of their salads + protein. I figure you can't really mess up a salad and it shouldn't take too long to prepare. Unfortunately, I've observed a confusing trend - maybe it is just by coincidence or happenstance, but it has happened a number of times and it baffles me. You know how when mixed greens get old, they are wilted and even sometimes rotten? When I've ordered salads to-go, the majority of the greens have been rotten; when I've ordered salads in the restaurant, the greens are fresh. What a disappointment!

Ambiance: The restaurant is on the darker side, and it's nothing to call home about - just your standard restaurant feel. There is only a very small TV at the bar, so if you are trying to catch a game, go into the Westin lobby bar or head to one of the local sports bars in Charlotte.

It's unfortunate that I can't leave a better review, but my experiences have just been so hit or miss. If they prove me wrong, I'll be sure to update my review."}
{"text":"Frankley - the food here was pretty great but a little pricey.  Being as the restaurant is inside the Westin, this comes as no surprise - it should almost be considered a given that any hotel restaurant will charge a $10 to $15 premium.  But at least the food was delicious.  Also with dinner comes a selection of bread with a tomato infused Hummus!  This might be worth a buck or two extra to make up for that overpriced Hotel experience.  All that being said though - I can't complain too hard - I liked the Ahi Tuna Tartar - but I also like the Ahi Tuna seared at Hops - and Hops is a bit more down to earth about it.  Aside from the complaint about pricing though - the Fattoush salad was tasty and the service was excellent.  It's a little more swank than some hotel restaurants and there's a good ambiance.  I can't give it 5 stars but the 4 are deserved. :)"}
{"text":"sevice is great that's why i gave a rating of 3 stars.  blue crab artichoke dip wad all right (nothing special), pita chips was freshly made.  parafelle pasta had a sauce that was too sweet. my friend had the rib eye sliders...not my kind of tea (shredded beef). mac n cheese was ok...had a smoky taste).  i'm not a mac n chz person but this was better than the pasta!"}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet has a made to order omelette stand. Lots of choices- both hot and cold. I didn't love my wife's sausage gravy, but everything else was tasty and satisfying. Buffet is $20 a head and includes drinks. Nice wait staff. Everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"OK, I really wanted to give more stars because there is so much good going on at Ember Grill. BUT when I pay $38 for a filet and it's the size of , well let's just call it \"petite-petite\", and the \"medium\" I ordered comes out well done, not a speck of pink or red on the meat, actually cooked into \"tough\" stage, it became a $16 Sizzler steak instead. Glazed carrots were amazing with candied orange, all four pieces that is, and mashed potatoes squirted onto the plate like a line of white toothpaste, a 1/2 inch wide by 6\" long squirt....and the serving plate was barely warm which means toothpaste potatoes get cold really fast... felt like they tried soooo hard, if they had just put a nice guy sized spoonful of good mashed potatoes and carrots I can sink my teeth into, and a steak grilled just right, on a really hot plate, THEN I'll easily cough up $38 + tax + 20% gratuity = $50. Gosh darnit, they just tried too hard maybe.....The flavors really were great, just too much going on for me."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, watched football while I did some work on my laptop. Attentive but not annoying bartender, well made drinks. Everything you need in a hotel bar."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a first date.  I researched a tad about the restaurant, but I hadn't ever talked to anyone who had been here.  The reviews I read shared how small the servings were and how pricey the menu was.  I will agree that the menu is pricey, but not outrageous.  I was also expecting more of a selection, but the menu is only about 20 items. As well, I like draft beer, but there were only four options as well -- a little of a disappointment.  Anyways, I ordered a chicken panini sandwich with fries, and the portion I was served was a decent amount (more than I was expecting after reading the reviews).  Our waiter was very courteous and patient with us trying to talk to one another and yet figure out what we wanted.  All in all, this restaurant is located inside of a hotel, and it would be a place I might go back to without actually staying at the hotel.  So....not bad."}
{"text":"Beautiful space and thank goodness we came after six and could enjoy free street paring uptown- I was told when I called for a reservation that the restaurant recommended that I park in the PAID parking deck- so I could be assuming incorrectly that they do not validate parking but weeellll..she kinda said  that.

We started off with chicken and waffle sliders- amazing. Smalls was my first entry into chicken and waffles and these are huge. I'm glad we only went with two instead of the four we considered getting for an app. great salty sweet combination and presentation.

We both had steak/filet and rib eye and it was cooked and seasoned well. The promised fried green tomatoes as a side turned out to be a friend green tomato. Just one lonely one.

Drinks are expensive- well it is a hotel- blueberry mojitos were refreshing but at $12 each the price was not. Also, from reading other reviews I assume they serve beer but it wasn't anywhere on the drink menu.

While dinner was pleasant our server was MIA and this place was EMPTY. I know it was a weeknight but still it was dinner time- where were the other diners?

Dessert was solid- but not amazing- you can't go wrong with a hot apple tart and cold vanilla ice cream. Overall this meal was a nice dinner out but not the best Charlotte has to offer.."}
{"text":"Bad service. Didn't even get to try the food since no wait staff even came our way. Sat 20 minutes, and left. No hello, no water, nothing. When I tried to phone them before I got to the restaurant, I called 4 times and it went to voice mail. What establishment doesn't answer their phone?!  Very disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some work folks.  Since it's a hotel restaurant, you should just assume it's going to be a little more expensive.  Ordered the bison sliders and spinach on the side, which worked for me.  The fish tacos looked good, though it was a bit messy.  The turkey club looked good too."}
{"text":"The food is good and so is the service. But, the menu is limited. But, they managed to squeeze in a few interesting items on the small menu. Why only three stars then? I expect much better from Westin."}
{"text":"Wandered in while staying at The Westin. Nice atmosphere and the waitstaff was very friendly.  I ordered The Paloma cocktail and even for a tequila and grapefruit drink was a little too bitter but I managed. The jalapeño cornbread they bring out while you're waiting for your food is fantastic! I ordered the shrimp po boy with sweet potato tots as my entree. The tots were great but the sandwich not so much. The French bread baguette roll was on the dry and stale side and the shrimp were over-cooked. Since I'm only in town for one more night, I will give it another go tomorrow and try something different. I don't mind risking it when work is paying."}
{"text":"Restaurant was in transition from breakfast to lunch when I arrived at 10:45AM.  Waited till 11:00AM but no help as far as being seated.  11:05AM approached by staff and was told that breakfast was over and only lunch was being served.  

I ordered the soup of the day.  Can't remember the name.  Soup was bland.  I also ordered a chicken panini.  It was okay but sweet to the taste.  First time having a panini that was sweet.

The decor of the restaurant was nice.  Wait staff were welcoming and helpful."}
{"text":"We purchased a deal for this place, and found we had an excellent meal here. It is in the hotel, and they do validate parking for you when you ask for it.
The burger I had was awesome, along with the sweet potato fries.
Hubby had shrimp and grits which was excellent.
Both of us tried dessert and really enjoyed it.
It definitely was pricey, but if the food is great I don't mind paying.
And I would return again for sure."}
{"text":"Service: generally good once seated but often patrons would have to wait at least 2-5 minutes until someone shows up to greet/seat them, even when the restaurant isn't too busy. Over my 3 breakfasts at the restaurant, I have seen few leaving after a couple minutes because of this. Additionally, they bring the check to your table while you're having your first few bites, saying \"there's no rush\". 

Food: for $23, I'd expect a little more variety and selection, but it appears they offer the same limited selection of food every day. To be fair, the salmon/cheese platter is quite good and the gravy/biscuit is in my opinion quite exceptionally good. Still doesn't quite justify the $23 price tag. Would've made more sense if it was at ~$18 range."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey for a breakfast buffet. 
We get breakfast here on early business meeting mornings. I think it opens at 6am.
It's quick food, good service and a nice environment. I LOVE their waffles and potato medley. You can get an omelet or eggs to order too."}
{"text":"It is unfortunate that I must give the restaurant one star because our food was good and we had an awesome bartender.  The hostess was very friendly also. 

The bad part...

I had a restaurant.com gift certificate, Not a COUPON, to use specifically for this restaurant. I've had a lot of problems and misunderstandings with restaurant.com this week so I specifically asked them if I could use my certificate for alcohol and they told me that this is one of the few that you can because they did not specify otherwise. There was nothing that stated that it could not be used for alcohol like my other ones. This was basically a gift card.

Numerous employees got involved in our situation. One guy said no, then a girl said yes, the a rude girl said no...then the manager got involved.

To make a long story short...the manager refused to let us use the certificate for drinks. She said that it is NC law that alcohol can't be discounted...not really sure what that means. Restaurants and bar run specials all the time...is that not discounting alcohol? Again, I had a certificate not a coupon so there  was no discount involved. It was just a lame excuse that she made up. I was so pissed....almost ruined our evening.

Our bartender was terrific, he needs to find a more reputable restaurant to work for."}
{"text":"I had lunch and dinner at this reataurant while staying at the Westin Charlotte.  

For lunch I had a chicken pannini and a side of sweet potato tots.  The food was very good.  My server was also serving as the bartender.  She was very nice, but seemed more interested in the conversations at the bar.  It took a while to get my drink since I had to remind her about it.

For dinner, I had the short rib.  It was excellent.  Server at dinner was friendly and attentive...obviously, he realized bringing out your first drink swiftly might lead you to drink it and order another...genius!"}
{"text":"Good spot for a casual meal if you are staying at the Westin or nearby.  Nice atmosphere, good food and friendly service.  I enjoy the food scene in Charlotte and always try to venture out...but if staying you are tired or don't feel like exploring, this is a more than adequate option for dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing, also the service is great. The wings are very tasty!!! For breakfast I always have the Eggs Benedict, with spinach."}
{"text":"This is A-OK because I didn't eat here.  We just tucked into the little space on the far side of the bar with the game on & my computer & had a couple of drinks while we looked up vacation sites.  The staff were all friendly though, & no one seemed to mind my sweetie & I chilling out for a few hours.  It was on the Sunday after St. Patricks & the Lobby Bar at the Westin didn't open until 5pm. (appalling!)"}
{"text":"Ahhh ember grille... brings back fond memories

- 2 poached eggs with whole wheat toast to go 
- breakfast buffets
- shrimp caeser salad, dressing on the side
- salmon dinners

Indeed I spent many a meal here..."}
{"text":"I kind of wonder what the Caesar salad would have looked like had I not added chicken ($5) and shrimp ($10). See picture. Note: if you order the same thing at Bar 10, the chicken is $3. The salad itself was only $9, but pricey given it is one piece of romaine lettuce grilled, it's pretty pricey. Not to mention, kind of odd - I've never had my romaine grilled. Not bad.

They recently changed their menu and increased prices. Burgers are one of the few actual foods that are under $25, but they have a ridiculous service charge and delivery fee if you order room service. Something like 11% and then 16%. Also the wait is sometimes over an hour. RIDIC. I hear the warm chocolate chip cookies are amazing. But I refuse to pay $10 for cookies or a pint of Haagen-Daaz when I can walk over to CVS and pick one up for $3.

4 stars because the shrimp was amazing (gigantic, fresh, and slightly salty) but really expensive. The chicken was generous and tender. And because they give you $25 coupons for breakfast or lunch or dinner, and that was enough to cover this uber expensive salad. 

And the breakfast buffet is amazing. Blueberry smoothies, steel cut oatmeal, breakfast potatoes, fresh berries, omelet bar, and more. What more can you ask for? Shout out to Annette - best waitress ever!

OVERALL: 5 stars for breakfast, 2.5 stars for dinner. Don't bother coming here if you don't have a voucher!"}
{"text":"A nice brunch buffet if you are visiting Charlotte and need a breakfast before you hit the road back home.  It is a little pricey, $23 per person.  The best things on the menu are the smoked salmon slices and cinnamon French toast style waffles.  The Omelets are just ok, I've had better.  Worst thing is the SERVICE!  Our waiter was nice but I felt rushed with him, and when I tried to ask the guy behind the buffet line about where the syrup was he was so rude about it and just said \"ask your waiter.\"  Really??!!!  One of the other guys had to ask me if I was ok and apologized.  They may need to rethink hiring some nicer staff, that is all."}
{"text":"I was at the Westin Charlotte for a wedding (here for 3 nights) and had breakfast one morning in the Ember restaurant and lunch on day two.
My lunch was yummy fish tacos. The flavor was amazing. At breakfast I opted for the omelette with veggies and bacon instead of the buffet and it was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. 

But I must say the service is why I would come back here. My server on both days was a woman named Hak. She was very professional, yet very kind to me and really everyone she served around me. I dined alone both times so I did have an opportunity to observe how everyone was treated and she was helpful and really knew the items on the menu. This experience really enhanced my stay at the hotel."}
{"text":"We bought a deal here thru Restaurant.com which turned out to be a good thing.  The prices weren't too bad, but then again we both had a burger.  I did feel that $4.00 for iced tea was a little steep (no pun intended), but totally the norm for a restaurant withing a swanky hotel.  
The waitress was great and very attentive.  I believe her name is Martha, but I can't be certain.  She kept our teas refilled and checked on us quite often.  
When the bill came, they had charge us a service charge which I realized was the automatic tipping that so many restaurants have started doing these days.  But the server was so great that we left her extra.
And they no longer validate parking...even if you do ask. 

Overall, the atmosphere is great, the server was awesome, and the foot was fantastic.  So I'm giving it 4 stars.  I'd suggest checking it out!"}
{"text":"Food: 
1) Pork Loins: Really tasty and well made! I'm not even a huge fan of pork but boy am I a HUGE fan of this! I just wish they gave me a BIGGER PORTION!
2) Salmon: Too dry, not seasoned well enough and WAY TOO SMALL of a PORTION. Not to mention, it was soaked in some type of bland soup AND it still managed to be TOO DRY. 
3) BBQ chicken Flat bread: OMG! SOOOOO YUMMY!! But again...portions are TOO SMALL!!
4) Biscuits: eh...nothing that great...they were biscuits...

Service: 
Really nice waitress! She kept trying to talk to us and get to know us a bit, but too bad my friend and I were too tired to keep the convo going...but she was nice! 

Price: 
So given how small the portion sizes were...this place was WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!! The meal came out to be OVER $90 and I seriously felt like I needed to go out and get me a nice burger from Five Guys or something! RIDICULOUSLY OVER PRICED!!! 

Ambiance: 
Very classy and trendy! I liked the new decor!

Overall:
I SERIOUSLY CAN'T AFFORD TO COME DINE HERE AGAIN!! The food was good but it wasn't worth an ARM and a LEG!"}
{"text":"First, I didn't know from reading the reviews that Ember is inside the Westin.   Know that before you go hunting for it!   We came for lunch and really enjoyed it.  Smoked tomato soup is a twist on standard tomato basil, and was excellent.  The mushroom flatbread is excellent, although a little heavy on the balsamic glaze.   Nonetheless, still really tasty.   The cheeseburger with sweet potato tots was really good.  Still just a cheeseburger, but done perfectly.   Service was attentive, friendly, and even brought the check when we were ready for it - usually the longest wait of the meal, but this time right on time!   I would definitely recommend Ember for lunch."}
{"text":"We went here for some drinks & apps during an NFL playoff game.  It was completely empty, so the service was great.

The margaritas we got were very good and pretty strong.  The highlight was easily the Chicken & Waffle sliders.  The waffle wasn't dry and the chicken tender was.... tender...and tasty.

They have a happy hour(5-7pm) here where the Chicken & Waffles are 1/2 price.  If you are visiting Uptown for Happy Hour, I would definitely check this place out.

This place seems hidden, but we enjoyed our time here and will return for some Happy Hours."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant.  Went for the first time for restaurant week for a reasonably priced prix fixe.  And when we went in the second time, there was another prix fixe.  Maybe that's all they do.  Either way, it's gonna cost you a little bit, but the food is so delicious.  They do the typical small upscale style entrees, which is good cause you don't leave feeling like you just ate a cow, but you are still satisfied.
For a restaurant in a hotel, it's very reasonable and very good.  The inside is very classy, with a modern look to it, but at the same time, since it's in the hotel, I don't believe they really enforce any dress codes.
They provide you with bread.  I got the lamb chops and chicken the two times I went.  I believe it may have been Ashley farms, but I'm not certain.  Both were excellent.  I wanted to suck the juices out of the bones haha."}
{"text":"Just had a lunch there at 1:30. The place is inviting. The service was terrific. Ordered club sandwich, and it was good as well."}
