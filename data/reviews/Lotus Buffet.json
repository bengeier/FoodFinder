{"text":"I was looking for a Chinese food cater for a small group party. Lotus catered a couple of friends' wedding so I called them to give it a try, though I had not been there before. Linda was super nice and she definitely knows how to do catering business and make her customers happy. I ordered fan fried dumplings and chicken wings. They were delicious. My guests were happy with the food too. Linda not only asked if I needed extra paper products and dipping sauces also followed up and asked how the food was. Linda was also very flexible with order amount and offered great prices for my orders. Great experience, also cater!"}
{"text":"B sanitation rating...do you need any more info?   They hide the rating behind balloons and pictures so you really have to look for it.   
Not impressed with price, selection or quality.   
Btw,   The sanitation grade was an 84."}
{"text":"I took my two sons there last night for my birthday dinner because I really wanted some crab legs and I had found this place online. Their website has several coupons, so I printed the one for the 1 person only buffet with crab legs, 4pm-close Sun. only for $24.99 (regularly $28.99). Once we had gotten our food and the waitress saw that I had crab legs, she came over to make sure that I knew the price. I told her that I did and that I had a coupon for $4 off. A few minutes later a man comes over to tell me that the only coupon is for a buy one get one free buffet that does not include crab legs. I told him that I had just printed the coupons from their website that day. He asked if he could see the coupon, so I gave it to him. He said \"Ok\", and then left. A few minutes later another man came over to explain to me that I should have read the fine print that states \"subject to change at any time\" and that they had discontinued that coupon a few weeks ago. To make a long story short, I can not believe that he was willing to risk a new and potentially regular customer over $4. but he was. He was very rude and said they would not accept the coupon. I was completely shocked at the horrible treatment of a new customer who came to try their restaurant based off of a false advertisement. I did not bother to tell him that it was my birthday and we simply got up and walked out. We had barely taken a couple of bites of food, so I was not going to give them one penny of my hard earned money as a single mother and a public school teacher! Had this not happened, I probably would not have taken the time to write a review about the fact that their food was absolutely disgusting based on the few bites that we did take!!!!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to. I'm shocked this place has 3 stars. My husband enjoys buffets so I allowed him to drag me here, but I will not be returning. 

-Execution of everything was poor. Sushi was mushy. Vegetables limp and overlooked. All sauces were too sweet and most tasted the same. Some items had no flavor at all. Just mush and a colorant. 

-Nothing on the buffet was hot. Nothing. It wasn't even warm. I have no idea how this hasn't failed a health inspection. 

-The ice cream variety was nice. But the amount of kids hanging into the case and slobbering into it was disconcerting."}
{"text":"My kids love Chinese buffets so I took them to lunch today. Haven't been here in a while. It always was an average place and still is. Not bad but not fantastic. Pretty much what you would expect from a Chinese Buffett. I did find the selection a little lacking for a Saturday, especially since you pay more in Saturday than during the week. Overall not a bad experience but just remember it is what is is :)"}
{"text":"Not the greatest food but not the absolute worst. The clientele is what will keep me away FOREVER! Rude.....sloppy......disgusting.......disrespectful people!   Staff was great though."}
{"text":"Ate here today with my ol' lady, and the food was great. Had 2 plates and a plate of fruit. Now here is where it gets tricky. I was full, and my lady discovered that they hadn't cleaned the shrimp properly before they cooked em.  Being that I had already ate about 6 or 7, ewww. So I'm like whatever, I'm about to eat this fruit, The grapes had seeds. ITS 2014, we got cars that drive themselves, we can flush toilets hands free, I should not bite into seeds in a grape. But like I said, the food was great. I'll let you judge. I got"}
{"text":"Know that I'm rating this a 1 start relative to all other Chinese buffets, not actually real restaurants.

It's the worst Chinese Buffet that I've ever stepped foot in. That is an amazing accomplishment.

Everything is room temperature and drenched in 
some kind of gelatinous paste.

They refunded half of the cost, which was nice, but the real cost was what it did to my stomach. I recommend any other \"food\" over this."}
{"text":"Lotus Buffet has been slinging their version of \"what working class Americans will eat as Asian food\" for years.   And it works.  Nothing fantastic, nothing bad.  Middle of the road quality for a $6.99 all you can eat lunch.  What the hell should one expect?

I thought the service was great, the food hot,  with a wide variety of options.  I don't want to know where ANY of the food was sourced.  I just ate it down.   My tip for buffet grazing is never go M-Thur.  Start on Friday and end by Sunday:  everything else is suspect to me.

Give 'em a whirl? Friday, Saturday or Sunday sure!"}
{"text":"The epitome of the Americanized Chinese buffet. As much fried American food as there is Chinese. Sushi is all surimi. Everything tastes the same, the way food does when you have a cold and your nose is stuffed up. Service is usually decent. It's cheap and the place is always packed; there's obviously a big market for this sort of thing.
They really need an extra person doing some cleanup on the food bar. The last time I was there you could literally feel the grime of everyone who had picked up the food ladles. Really grossed me out and have never been back."}
{"text":"I like Lotus quite a bit, by far my favorite buffet in Charlotte. I usually go during lunch hours (before 4pm) because the dinner buffet runs about $10 plus drink and tip... I believe it's $6.99 for lunch.

Lots of vegetarian items! The mai fun, fried rice, and lo mein on the buffet are always vegetarian and I believe they make their own vegetarian spring rolls. I really like their sliced fried zuchini, it's not always served though. 

They have a dessert bar as well as a freezer with about six varieties of ice cream and sherbert."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here. The price was only $5! Which is pretty awesome for a buffet (or any lunch for that matter). Their sushi was really good for a buffet but there was only a small variety. They have many different dishes and there were really only two dishes I didn't like out of the whole buffet. They do try to make sure you don't waste food with signs at the buffets and tables saying only take what you can eat or they will charge you. They also have many choices of ice cream and cakes for desert. The staff was also very friendly (and of some pretty attractive ones too)"}
{"text":"(Logged into the wrong account for my first review but it's still facts!)

LOTUS BUFFET LUNCH IS"}
{"text":"2 types of sushi on buffet; both tasteless and indistinguishable from the other. Wasabi also without heat or flavor. 
Hot and sour soup also tasteless. Hot temperature-wise, but not at all spicy. 
Zero spicy items on buffet. 
Seafood delight was an oily mess. 
Sesame chicken was not bad. 
Jalapeño chicken was tasty. But as mentioned previously, not at all spicy. 
Broccoli chicken possibly undercooked, but maybe they assume the broccoli will sit there for a while. 
Stuffed jalapeños packed some heat, but the stuffing part was kinda gross. 
Background of insipid pop music did not aid digestion. 
Service was adequate for a buffet. 
Positive side was the low low price for lunch. 
Stuck in a Verizon dead zone making posting this review very tedious. 
Still searching for a University-area Chinese lunch spot."}
{"text":"Big buffet restaurant. Lots of options, lots of seating.

The food was reasonable quality for a buffet, and the food seemed buffet quality fresh even an hour before closing. Lots of choices for meat eaters (vegetarians, see note below). I was amazed to see French fries and mac and cheese at a Chinese buffet, but there they were alongside the egg drop soup and fried spring rolls.

I'd say the food is not health food (e.g. the noodle dish was quite greasy), so it's fairly standard Chinese food style eating.

Don't miss the ice cream freezer in the back. About 8-10 flavors of scoop your own.

Not a place for vegetarians. That's what I am, so that's my main perspective. While they do have a few vegetarian options in the buffet, they were just meat dishes without the meat. No tofu to be found anywhere. If you're vegetarian and end up here, you'll be able to eat, but you probably will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was passing through this area on my way into Charlotte and stopped in to have a quick lunch. Lotus buffet had so many options it was hard to even choose! I ended up going with the pepper chicken combo and the egg drop soup. The pepper chicken was extremely flavorful and it came with a good amount of fried rice. I also really enjoyed the egg drop soup. It was probably the best I've had in the area. I am excited I found this new place and will be back 100% to try different items. Also very excited I found out they can deliver through different apps and I will note this when staying in the area. Highly recommended place with friendly staff and lots of great options."}
{"text":"Have been here twice. Food is subpar at best. Staff is \"out to lunch.\" They charged my credit card the wrong amount, realized they messed-up and then charged it again without my authorization, thus nearly maxing out my credit card. Thanks, guys! You'll never see me again!"}
{"text":"Wow yelp community! I feel like I have done you a disservice by never writing a review about lotus!! I guess this is me giving up my best kept secret. Guilty pleasure if you will. Because somedays I look in my fridge and all I can think about is there delicious buffet! 

My fiancé is adamant about the Italian shrimp and the coconut shrimp. Feels it's the best thing here. Coconut shrimp is in a creamy glazed sauce. And the italian shrimp is breaded and has a little kick to it. So he says, never have I ever eaten shrimp! 

We both agree on the hot and sour soup! If your not feeling well this is where it's at! It's restaurant quality! And it's all veggies! And, it's hands down better than fuse which is minutes away and tin tin. The quality of food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I work nearby so I decided to give this place a shot for lunch. Their weekday lunch buffet is $5, which is a plus. Their food isn't worth raving over, but you get what you pay for and it's pretty decent for the price. Most of their food is the same unremarkable chinese food you'll get at any chinese restaraunt. Their food is exactly what you'd expect, but it's cheap and convinient so it's certainly worth it if you're feeling hungry and frugal."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this place pretty often. The food is always delicious and fresh. I love the crab ragoons! Best I have tasted! Staff is always friendly and service is nothing to complain about. We always get a friendly, \"come spend your money with us\" smile and greeting every time we come, which is wonderful in today's society. Considering the fact that some businesses feel they don't have to appeal to, or make any effort to earn your business. The watermelon is really sweet and delicious too! Health/Sanitation grade was 98.5. Enjoy! I always do! OMG! I almost forgot,  the Sake is the bomb.com!"}
{"text":"Since there are more options in the area Lotus has really took the last place to go. The buffet area look very small compared to the other Chinese buffets. The pricing is a bit high. I would definitely choose a different buffet overall. The food is ok, I only go when we get their coupons in the mail or they have a promotion. Cause it's really not worth the $10.99 they charge"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Lotus, haven't been in a while since they open that new buffet next to Big Lots however wanted some crabs legs so decided to go. First off the crab legs taste like it had been soaking in water for 2 days. I complained about it the manager came over and said there was a fresh batch coming out...That was not the reason I will never set foot into that place again....got my 6 year old cookie & cream ice cream noticed something pink when we were scooping it out but thought it was some strawberry ice cream. While eating the ice cream my daughter took a pink fake finger nail out of her mouth, I was so disgusted. Brought it to the attention of my waiter but rather than offering an apology he ask who's nail that was...I looked at him \"like you cannot be serious\" he then said kids get their own ice-cream all the time without supervision so it may have come from a kid. Clearly that was an adult finger nail...We quickly paid and got out of there...what if my daughter had swallowed this nail? They never even got rid of the ice cream container that dirty fake finger nail was it....Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Not the worst Chinese I've had, but definitely not the best.  Good for a cheap lunch, but very Americanized selection.  Wait staff is friendly and attentive, the food was hot, buffet was fairly well maintained.  

More like fuel than food!"}
{"text":"Why you should NOT eat here. Cold food, poor selection, Horrible customer service. Asked why the age limits for Buffet were not posted they said it was online. Asked if they could add it to a sign that had the Adult and child prices written on a small eraser board - they said NO. The food was almost room temperature and only turned the steam table up AFTER more people came in after we did. DO NOT eat at Lotus Buffett - they do not understand the dynamics of even average customer service."}
{"text":"4.99 is a steal for lunch buffet from Monday thru Friday. Standard Chinese food and the green beans are good. They do have vegetarian egg food young which is good. If you want cheap and convenient food then go to Lotus Buffet."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here on a Sunday night because we wanted Chinese food and it was one of the closer places we had as an option.  We have been feeling like old people these days and wanted to try a buffet.  Keep in mind for this review that we are vegetarians and that did contribute to our disappointment with this experience, but not so much.

When we arrived, the image of the establishment quickly began to drop, and it never stopped.   I saw that there were many, many kids both in the restaurant and more who were waiting to come in.  There was a \"policy\" posted on the host stand that dealt with children and having them stay away from the buffet.

Another thing I noticed was that this buffet was small, and the price I saw that we would be paying per person was $10.99 (definitely a problem for us vegetarians, but I will get to the fact that the quality was still not there).  With drinks, we ended up paying $30 for an incredibly low quality meal that I still regret committing to.

Most things in the buffet were cold enough that when I got to the table to eat, everything I had on my plate was no longer hot.  Most of their vegetarian options were limited, and the buffet did not seem fully stocked.  My girlfriend had gotten some lo mein which I wanted to try, and when I went to get some, the container was empty except for the remaining noodles that were stuck to the bottom.  The egg foo yung (that we both decided to try for the first time) did not have much flavor at all as well.  The Chinese donuts (one of the reasons I had wanted to go to a buffet) were also hard and old-tasting.

I should mention again that kids are rampant at this establishment.  If you are looking for a quiet, quality meal, or are looking for value for your money, go somewhere else.  The best thing we had to eat were green beans, but they were definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"i like here  food is good .  It's easy to find the shop. My favorite is honey chicken wings"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The waitresses barely spoke english, and got upset when I asked them to repeat themselves. They were very cold and short tempered with me and my family. 

When I went to pay, the man behind the desk was texting or doing something on his phone, and did not immediately attend to our service. 

The food was cold, not kept warm and food all over the buffet, and is overly greasy, there are other ingredients other than oil."}
{"text":"Always appreciate the excellent food.  Today not in ticket crab kegs but the deep fried seasoned dungee crabs were the best."}
{"text":"Not bad but not the best.

We've eaten here twice. The first time was so-so, the second time was better.  Food-wise

(Gross out side note: their bathrooms need better ventilation. The second time we ate here, we were seated on the side near the bathroom. Let's just say that after someone went in, we had to move to the other side of the restaurant to escape the smell.)

The price is okay. Better if you have a student ID."}
{"text":"The buffet is of a good size, and it does appear to be kept relatively fresh, but I'm going to have to say that the quality is... questionable.  I'm not trying to say that the food is undercooked or anything along those lines.  Just that when you bite into a piece of teriyaki chicken on a stick, it should generally taste like chicken (or at least a meat that tastes like chicken).

Doing so here tasted like, well, something else.  In fact, just about everything here tasted like something else.

Again, it wasn't that the food was bad or out-of-date or anything.  It is just that everything - meat, vegetables and even sauces - didn't taste quite right.  It's quite possible that the taste buds in my mouth were off or something, but a bite a short while later at the bakery was just fine.  So my money is on the Lotus Buffet.  You can draw your own conclusions."}
{"text":"10 years ago I came in regularly and enjoyed.  The bar lost its self and I stopped going in completely.  Earlier this year I got a coupon and decided to walk in to take a glance at the selection.  The restaurant wasn't crowded at all, but I was shocked how fresh the food looked so I settled down to enjoy excellent cooked crab legs, cray fish, shrimp. Salt/pepper octopus..  great cooks and fresh,  also ice cold beer.  The only thing that can use help with is the sushi.  They do not do any real selection but everything else out ways the sushi.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Please save your money if you don't like what you get they say oh well too bad it's what we have to serve. I went on Tuesday 6/21 had crab legs they were soft and no taste and brown. The manager said they are brown because they have a lot of meat in them that's so wrong. She also said after eating one leg that you got your money worth. She informed me crab is from the sea so how they taste we can't do anything about and also what our warehouse send us we sell even though they don't look right."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the buffet. Good prices and a variety of foods!"}
{"text":"Decent buffet.  Good price.  If you are looking for a large selection- this is not the place.  But if you want to fend of hunger and need a decent meal at a decent price this is the place."}
{"text":"After eating here on numerous occasions over the past two years, I can tell you that the quality of their food has went down. Furthermore, they charge way too much for their take out plates. I've been charged as much as $8.50 for a take out plate from the Buffet, when other times I've been charged $4.00 or $5.00 for the same amount of food at the same time of day (this matters because they charge different prices for lunch and dinner take out....). I've told myself I won't eat here again until they improve the quality of their food, and they become consistent with their take out prices from the buffet"}
{"text":"Decent food if you're not a Chinese food enthusiast. Low quality food but the $4.95 lunch special makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Majority of food I ate or attempted to eat was VERY poor quality. It was cold and soggy. The fried shrimp was mostly breading. Beef and broccoli was over cooked so I tried the steamed broccoli which was cold!!! Prices have increased and quality has decreased!!! 
Not sure why I should leave a tip. Never offered any assistance or offer for beverage refill."}
{"text":"Nope.  Not todaaaaaaaayyyyy.  2nd worst Chinese buffet  Ive had in Charlotte.  Bathrooms horrible and stinky.  Entire restraunt interior dated, worn, gloomy, and dirty.  Food selection bad.  Only 1 shrimp option during lunch, was unpeeled deep fried.  Too hard to peel and eat and I don't eat with peel on.  General Tso's was watery and tastless, breading waterlogged.  The General is rolling in his grave as you read this.  Crab Rangoon not homemade, minimal filling.  Sesame chicken too sweet and waterlogged, sauce tastes like marshmallow.  BBQ chicken not bbq, was watery and faintly tastes like Chinese 5-spice.  Calamari was rubbery with a waterlogged salty coating.  Hot wings submerged in red water.  Cheese mussels okay, best thing on buffet.

Save your money and get something from Caribbean Hut or Flying Saucer, both are in the same complex."}
{"text":"Greasy unappetizing fried food. Low quality ingredients. Pretty much tastes all the same.

Never again."}
{"text":"Buffet costed $12 for dinner. Although good service, the food wasn't really fresh @ 7 pm and tasted bland. Fried rice was on the soggy side. Fried food was already really dry and crusty. And desert was unappealing."}
{"text":"We ordered take out a couple of days ago and were pleasantly surprised! We called in for some egg drop soup and chicken lo mein. (Chow mein is apparently not noodles, don't get confused.) The food was hot and ready in 15 mins when we walked in for pick up. We also snuck a peak at the buffet, fully loaded and it looked pretty good! (There is also a coupon for $5 off two adult dinner buffets, FYI. Buffet for $15 sounds good to me.) Definitely coming back for that! 

The food, especially the lo mein was really good! We weren't expecting much from fast food Chinese but the chicken used in the lo mein were good cuts! And they packed that little carry out box like it was Mary Poppin's bag, the lo mein just wouldn't stop coming out! The egg drop was pretty good, a little heavy though. 

We will definitely be come back and you should try it out too, don't let the low stars scare you."}
{"text":"best chinese food! people that work here are so nice!"}
