{"text":"I went at lunch for AYCE it was only $11.50 which is a really good price. The sushi was just average not super amazing but not horrible tasting, but THE MENU is TINY, there is a very very small selection of food. All in all for the price you pay it is good and worth it. I would go back if I'm on a low budget."}
{"text":"I like stopping here after the gym for a little lunch. Food is good, service is friendly and efficient and prices are reasonable. I like the variety of bento box combos for when I can't decide what to get."}
{"text":"I'm new moving to Newmarket and first time here, horrible and won't back, forget their sushi."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place a few times now and every time I've been there the service has been very friendly, the food was good (not great) and the prices weren't bad. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a quick lunch in the area.  The best part is honestly the service, the owner (I think?) is always there and friendly, and actually once allowed me to go home to get cash to pay for my meal (that I had already eaten) as the payment method I had on me they didn't accept (this doesn't really happen anywhere else, and he didn't get upset, he just said \"see you soon!\" and I came back within 20m to pay for my meal with cash)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The sushi is tasty and their bento combinations are very filling. My husband and I ordered the D1 and D4 between us and it was more than enough food. We just had the leftovers for lunch! The calamari is unbelievable. One of the best I have had and the tempura is top notch. Mmmm, and I could eat their spicy salmon rolls forever. To top it all off, the prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"We've been regulars here for 6 years - takeout, delivery, and eat-in. Always consistently fresh, proper temperature, friendly service (they know us by name now!), and the thickest salmon sashimi in town.  They occasionally have new rolls out that are posted on the board. Love Sushi Garden!"}
{"text":"Right on the SouthWest side of Yonge and Wellesley, I want to concur with the other reviews about recommending this place.  My wife and I feel this is a place worth visiting and we would definitely go back.    All the ingredients tasted fresh, sushi pizza was well put together (the fried rice part was light, flavourful, and consistent in texture), prices are good. Cheap by sushi restaurant standards. eg. 13 pieces of sashimi for $10.      And my main barometer of a sushi restaurant.... the wasabi!  This one was good.  Fresh, light but most of all, packed the right amount of punch (I could have gone a tad bit higher, but that's just me who likes it strong).       For the value and quality of food, I would highly recommend, especially since it's hard to find out which ones are worth the visit given the large amount of Sushi restaurants along Yonge Street.    Service, the waiter, while not your 'traditional' asian restaurant type, was fast, friendly, courteous and good at anticipating what was needed."}
{"text":"The inside of this Sushi Garden is pretty spacious, but it's a bit hard to stumble across if you're not looking for it, tucked away in Delisle Court. Even though they have big windows, the only view is of the other restaurants tucked away off the Yonge Street sidewalk.  When I was last here I split the sushi \"boat\"--an actual boat-shaped serving place filled with an assortment of sushi--with two other people, and none of us came away hungry. At around fifty bucks, that's not a bad price to get stuffed on sushi."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Just had dinner at the st clair location. i ordered 12 pieces of specialty rolls, thinking that i would have some leftovers for home. the sushi they served was so tiny, you are better off going to other sushi places around. waste of my time and money.  service was good. food not so much."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is amazing and the prices are pretty good, the only problem is that they give you a baby sized portion of food. This is coming from a 110lb girl so i'm not even exaggerating. By the time my boyfriend and I were well fed and ready to leave the bill was racked up to $45, not what I was expecting and not why I make the trip to Sushi Garden. I won't go back."}
{"text":"We are addicted to this place... consistently good, friendly service, close to home.  We've tried two other sushi places nearby, and this one is the winner."}
{"text":"One of our go-to places in the neighborhood for a good meal cheap. Everything I've tried here has been good - from sushi, to udon soup, to their Japanese curry. For two people, we usually spend under $25 and leave satisfied and full."}
{"text":"Maki were small and not very fresh. Both my friend and I felt a bit sick after our meal. Not going back."}
{"text":"***This review is solely based off of their takeout.  I ordered a couple rolls, salad, soup and tempura from JustEat.ca  their takeout. The service was really easy to use and the delivery came just as I ordered and really on time. So if it was based on their service then this review would be 5 stars because I couldn't believe how accurate, easy and fast the delivery from Justeat and Sushi garden was. Amazing.  Unfortunately the food was very sub-par. The rolls were super tiny and understuffed. The spicy salmon had very little tempura bits and small peice of salmon along with no sauce. The tempura was also very small serving and didn't taste very good, the veggies tasted like they were a little bit old. I was super underwhelmed by all of it. My co-worker said the same thing about her rolls. We are big sushi fans and we stopped eating mid-way and threw it out because it wasn't very good."}
{"text":"The service is really good and the owner is really nice. But they don't take debit cards. The restaurant feels like a fast food place. The seaweed salad isn't good or fresh."}
{"text":"1. Prices on the website and actual prices differ by 1-4 dollars resulting in me overpaying by $10. That was not a pleasant surprise at all. With tip I paid 40$ for two people. 2. My eel maki did not have eel in them only skin. My soft shell crab tasted off so much that I could not finish it. 3. Katsu don chicken combo #6 looked so sad that I am thankful it was not for me. 4. The miso soup was very diluted and tasteless. How can you mess up a miso soup from a packet is beyond me... 5. THE ONLY GOOD THING: they deliver to nearby places and are pretty fast. I waited for 20 min max.  I am very surprised that they are still in business. If you want to eat good food go to Mc Donals it will taste better and cost way less."}
{"text":"Sushi Garden is one of those places that is easy to miss. It's a small place just off Yonge St. on Wellesley St. W.  For those interested, it's not run by Japanese people, but Chinese. And there's no butchered irashaimase to welcome you, FYI.  Sushi Garden serves your typical Japanese resto fare: sushi, Japanese appetizers, noodle/rice dishes and bento boxes.  I'm a big fan of getting the best deal out of my dollar, and this place knows it well and does it well.  A large bowl of vegetable udon, served out of a metal bowl, is $5. 7 pieces of yam tempura for $4? Bring it on I say.  Some may find that the vegetables added with udon to be bizzare or out of the ordinary but I find that it's decent enough and passable.  Skip the edamame though, it's a little overboiled.  Groups of 5+ be warned: It's a REALLY small and narrow place."}
{"text":"The all you can eat !!! It's very easy to use words like delicious or tastes so good but this meal was exceptionally well done and served with a lot of care.   Price is a little higher than the competition but the taste IS worth it.   Our 2 year old son loved it and even mentioned it was very very yummy. (Cost Extra 6$ for him)"}
{"text":"Very good sushi.  Pleasant staff and good choice of sushi rolls.   Tucked away in a quaint area too near st Clair.   My usual sushi place."}
{"text":"Came here last week craving for sashimi and found this place on yelp. I wasn't sure what to expect but I was surprised.  I ordered salmon, scallop, and sweet shrimp sashimi and they were all very fresh. Each piece of salmon was thick cut, unlike most Japanese restaurants in Toronto. The scallops were on the smaller size though but the shrimp were really yum too.   I would definitely come back for a sashimi fix if I'm in the area again"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood. I had dinner twice inside, but I usually went to get take out. Inside there were nice tables and comfortable seats with good space. The atmosphere was good. The service was good. The foods were good looking and very presentable. However, the taste was not excellent but not that bad. I could cook better chicken teriyaki though. Yonge and St.Clair seemed to be competitive for Japanese restaurants and this place was the best looking place, I thought. Even though foods were not the best, probably I would take my friends to Sushi Garden more because the insides looked good and the service was consistent."}
{"text":"Had a good experience here. Lunch prices are very reasonable and the food tasted quite fresh. The rolls, as mentioned in another review, are on the smaller side, however the bright taste made up for it. I can see myself coming back here. Also very friendly service. I was satisfied. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"decent orices, lotssss  of different options/permutations of bento boxes, packed well!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down my favourite sushi place in the city.  The good: The service is excellent, prices are cheap. Food is amazing.  The bad: honestly, nothing. They don't take debit, which is a bit irritating but that's it.  Salmon sushi pizza is really good - if you're a fan of sushi pizza, this is one of the better ones with the right mix of sauce and deep-fried rice base.  Tempura is a little bland, but I usually find that anywhere.  One of the highlights is their spicy crispy avocaco roll - avocado-topped maki with little bits of tempura inside and a secret sauce. The absolute best sushi I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is an excellent local sushi restaurant. They deliver (promptly) which is a good thing, and not too many decent sushi restaurants deliver. Their sashimi is noticeably fresh and they make a wonderful unagi sushi, in addition to some very tasty specialty rolls. They are not cheap, but you certainly get what you pay for in terms of quality, preparation and overall freshness. Definitely worth ordering from."}
{"text":"Located in a spot that you easily walk by and with all the hustle and bustle of Yonge St I wouldn't blame you if you missed this place.  However you might blame yourself if you miss this place and not give it a shot!  This isn't the best sushi in town but man it's got some delicious sushi for a fraction of the price.  The menu isn't as extensive of other places either but what they have going is a menu they do pretty damn well.  I'd recommend anything from here.  Take your time and enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Great place for fresh sashimi!  The 70 piece 55$ sashimi boat is a awesome deal.  Good variety, super fresh and delicious!    My only beef with this place is the shorter waiter is cold and stern and every time we go we hope that we don't get him."}
{"text":"I don't know what people are thinking to give this place such a high rating. It's a mediocre Japanese restaurant, low quality, food taste bad. Chicken teriyaki is mostly from the cheapest cut of chicken legs. If you want a better Japanese, walk over a little bit to Sushi Gen, or better yet Sushi Kyu."}
{"text":"I may try other sushi restaurants around Newmarket, but I keep coming back to the Sushi Garden.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the staff are always very welcoming and pleasant.  The owner is always there and personally serves his customers alongside his staff.  The prices are reasonable and the menu selection is great.  They also have two tatami rooms for private gatherings, as well as teppanyaki!  They are also licensed and serve several Japanese beers, as well as sake."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with good sized portions that's very close to home. Great prices and incredible salad. Would definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"It's my go-to neighbourhood sushi place.  Yes, there are better places with more exotic and interesting sushi.  But it's consistent, reliable, and tasty.  Fish is always fresh.  Can't beat the price either.  Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Good if you want something super cheap and super fast -- basically you can get full here for $12 or less.  I used to love this particular location, but after more than a few mishaps, I hadn't been back in a long time.  Decided I just wanted something really small so we stopped in, the place was empty.  The entire restaurant smelled like dirty mop (and along with the \"wet floor\" sign, I guess they had just 'cleaned').    The food was exactly what you'd expect from cheap sushi - nothing awe-inspiring, but edible.  I think their seafood tempura appetizer is the standout for me.  Always hot and good selection, especially for $4.99!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few sushi places in the Newmarket and Stouffville areas, but my favorite by far is Sushi Garden. The staff are all very nice people, and the fact that the owner is there on a regular basis and interacts wit customers is a very positive thing to see. Also, when I have called ahead for a pick up order, the owner has consistently remembered my name, which is a nice, personal touch.   Their food is great, atmosphere is great, and the staff are lovely people. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have to update my review because this place grew on me. After going there countless times and having a great experience every single time, I though to myself: why shouldn't this place be worthy of five Yelp stars?  The service is consistently good. The server is mostly the same guy always, one that looks like an Asian Anderson Cooper. He's very nice and polite. Since our first visit we ventured into some different rolls such as the Kamikaze, the Snow Mountain and the Flying Dragon, all of them very tasty. And, as I pointed out before, they prepare the sushi quickly but not sloppily.  Keep up the good food, Sushi Garden!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner cause the other place we wanted to go was off until the new year. It was empty. Literally, no one else in the restaurant. And it was 6:15 PM.  Most of the lights were dimmed so we weren't even sure if the place was even open, had it not been for the neon OPEN sign. Seems like after we came in, the owner started turning on the lights.  Menu was pretty simple: you get a dozen different options of the usual sushi's or maki's, or some bento boxes.  Food is nothing special. I ordered a bento box that came with teriyaki salmon, a few slices of salmon sashimi, a few rolls, along with rice, miso soup and salad. The sashimi was a bit mushy, which probably means it's not very good quality. Salmon teriyaki was ok. Salad was not bad. Miso soup felt a bit thick, but maybe that means extra miso? Can't say I'd pay $9.99 for it.  My main concern with this location is sanitation. On the way to the washroom, there was a foul smell coming from the basement, and the smell became stronger the closer you approached the employee-only room. The door to the staff room itself was partially open, and you can really smell something bad coming from inside. It was completely dark, except for a dim red light coming from an EXIT sign in the back. Who knows what's inside, but I wasn't prepared to find out given that all the lights were dim in the basement and you're pretty much looking at a horror scene.  Hopefully the food you're prepared was properly stored. They've got a PASS from dinesafe, but I didn't pay attention to when that was assigned."}
{"text":"Things have gone downhill, and this ace doesn't seem that great. or at least not when i was there! It was a cold drafty and unclean place with mediocre service  ( brought me wrong food and I had to repeat the words spider roll 6 times and point to the menu 3 times!  ) the worse thing was that their portions are TINY, and not satisfying. Their rolls are so small, it's a joke because I've never seen such terrible rolls. They also look like they are gonna fall apart any moment !  Even cheap all you can eat buffet does better than it. We ended up paying $50 for something that was barely worth $15. Don't go there!"}
{"text":"We just got take out from this sushi place. We usually go to Sushi Gen, which is a block away on Yonge at Delisle, however, because of Canada day this was the only local sushi restaurant that was open. The fact that it was open until 830pm on Canada day is really the only positive thing I can say.  We got a platter of cucumber roll, tuna maki, spicy tuna, and tuna nigiri (we were in a tuna mood). Every SINGLE thing was bad. After reading other positive reviews about this place I am confused. I had to run to the bathroom to spit out one of the nigiri and then brush my teeth. I poured myself a glass of white wine to kill any leftover bacteria. Not only was the tuna disgusting and not edible but the cucumber roll was equally as bad. The cucumbers inside the roll were soggy and soft and had a weird taste.  I am quite disappointed as I did read some good reviews for this place, however, clearly we didn't receive the same good sushi others spoke about. Perhaps they ran out of fresh ingredients bc they were opened late on a national holiday. I don't know. Regardless, I don't think we'll ever go back there and we will stick to Sushi Gen for our local sushi take outs and trips."}
{"text":"Not bad, never been disappointed never been that impressed either, Ive been here a half dozen times and typically order sushi  Good reliable place, service alright, ambience blah but it has nice windows, good value"}
{"text":"We came in around 3pm for lunch. Granted slow time of day - but targetted this place with its \"5 star\" review after visiting Sushi Itto and Golden Sushi seeking higher quality.   The place is dated, signage out front makes it look out of business.  I think we woke them all up cause once we came in they all came from the back and unwrapped the seran wrap off all the food and started preparing...yuck.   Still wanting to give it the benefit of the doubt because of the reviews here we ordered.   Food was at best standard all you can eat quality.  A $30 platter had very litte butterfish or salmon. None of it tasted really fresh.  They really skimped out on quality... As well as quantity.  For $30 we could have ate all you could eat and probably a better lunch.  We just assumed this would be better quality from its reviews.  When we started eating they all came out and ate their lunch too.  Its more like their house than a restaurant.    The only reason we gave it a 2 is because they were super friendly.  The habachi table and private rooms looked like this place could be good with a reno and fresher food/menus.   But this is NOT a 5 or 4 star in our opinions."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Great food for a  great price! He gave me free Miso soup with 9 California Sushi rolls and Shrimp Tempura for 11.00! - Lunch time."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get. I've been to many, many sushi restaurants in the city -probably one of the worst. Rolls were very small, with mainly rice, and a long piece of hair on it. $30 all in for 18 small pieces of maki. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The sushi garden is a decent Japanese restaurant serving common Japanese style dishes. What's good about it is that it's sort of the safe style Japanese food catering to Canadians mild pallet. I've been here many times because my family likes it and the food is consistent. Furthermore the Bento boxes are decently priced and are pretty good size."}
{"text":"Small Cozy place with friendly staff! I even saw the chef/owner(?) come out to give the bill to one of the (presumed) regulars.  My waitress was very nice and prompt. I ordered a salmon lover which included salmon sashimi, salmon sushi, and a salmon roll. I asked to substitute for a spicy salmon roll (my usual benchmark maki) and they were more than happy to do so.  I'll be going again to try a chirashi don to rate the quality of their other seafood varities.  UPDATE: Went for Chirashi Don, the food quality was a lot worse than before.  Red tail looked dirty, and Salmon was crunchy due to still being frozen! The salmon was still decent though.  The restaurant was victim to a very poor cold draft every time the door opened."}
{"text":"First time here and had a great experience. The service was fast and friendly and the place has a lovely ambience. The avocado salad is quite a generous portion and has the most amazing ginger dressing. The short rib appetizer wasn't overly fatty and they had a great sweet sauce on them. What really impressed me was their spicy tuna- great price, great size and ACTUAL pieces of tuna rather than the more commonly chopped up tuna at lower end sushi places. I also tried a kamikaze roll which was nice. The food came out so quickly, but that didn't jeopardize the quality of the dishes. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Yes, this restaurant is run by Chinese but the sashimi is excellent and at $13 for 18 pieces, an excellent value.  It lacks the fancy presentation a higher priced Japanese restaurant would offer but the quality of the fish is excellent.  The service is friendly and efficient and I visit here whenever I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good service, convenient location, lots of choice on the menu, and fresh sushi. One complaint is that most of the meals, including the lunches, do not automatically come with soup and salad. I think of that as the norm, and this as sort of miserly of them. If you want to add soup and salad, it's an extra $2. Anyway, went with 3 co-workers today at lunch. We were seated immediately and didn't have to wait to order. Once we ordered, the food started coming right away. That's my kind of lunch! I will say it was hard to choose what to order. The menu is huge and not that well organized. There are so many different combinations, it's hard to settle on one. It's nice to have a lot of choice, though, so I am not complaining. I had a combo plate with miso soup, 4 pieces of sushi (shrimp, salmon, eel) and a roll. The food is very fresh, good portion sizes, and it came quickly. Combo plate cost $9.99. Everyone ordered something different; all sushi and/or rolls and was well received. The server was very nice and attentive, and the place was packed. I was with 3 others, 2 of whom were from Montreal where they like separate checks. The server was very accomodating and gave us each our own bill with no problems. I really appreciated the quick service and the fresh food. Definitely a place I will visit again."}
{"text":"Good sushi in general if you aren't a traditionalist.  Just look at the menu and you will find a variety of dishes I have not seen in any sushi restaurant anywhere.  While the do serve the standard sushi selections, a lot of emphasis is on these specialty items.  On traditional sushi, it can be a bit hit and miss.  I have had red tuna that is quite good, and was a generous cut, but seemed to have a strange texture.  The octopus was chewy in contrast.    Sushi Garden has one of the only Teppan table sections around, but I don't recall seeing anyone there.  With Chitose a few blocks away, I can't see a compelling reason to make Sushi Garden my \"go-to\", but when invited by someone else, I would not refuse.  Great potential, and they seem to be visionary in menu creations, but not in the lead position yet."}
{"text":"Really Average food, bought a 11 dollar teriyaki salmon meal It comes in a decent sized portion, big bowl of soup that tastes like regular miso soup. the pieces of salmon sashimi were quite good, the california rolls were a little weak, didnt have much filling.  The actual entree itself was not good, the teriyaki salmon wasn't really teriyaki, there was no teriyaki sauce, it was not even a little sweet, in fact it had very little flavor, the stir fried beansprouts the salmon sat on had more flavor than the salmon itself. Rice was normal and the salad was also typical and pretty good.  The owner was really nice when I ordered the take out though so I'll give it that."}
{"text":"Sushi Garden is one my favourite spots in the Yonge and St Clair area for a quick but delicious lunch. It has a great selection of lunch specials with very affordable prices (especially considering the location of the restaurant). For instance, $5.99 gets you a general portion of Chicken Teriyaki with Miso Soup, complimentary Japanese tea, and consistently prompt and courteous service. The quality of the sushi at Sushi Garden is also decent and definitely worth the price tags.   The only odd part is they will take credit cards but not debit card or American Express, so be aware before you step in!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I would've given this place 4 stars if the current rating wasn't 4.5/5. The restaurant would have to blow me away to reach 4.5 standard, and sadly it didn't reach to that point. However I'll give them some credit for their variety because their sushi specials (not lunch specials) can consist of many different kinds of fish.  I had the tuna/surf clam/OCTOPUS!/flying fish roe + 6 salmon rolls combo. It came with a soup, but no salad. The miso soup was extremely bland; there was barely any taste at all. Eh, whatever.  The sushi and maki were all actually good given the price ($8.99 for 10 pieces; definitely on the lower side), with the fish tasting like fish and not some sort of weird non-fish taste. Of course there are definitely better sushi restaurants around, but if budget is something you're tight in this restaurant would definitely satisfy your hunger.  Service was good as well; I was quickly asked what drink I wanted (like literally before I sat down). Some restaurants they don't even ask you until after you order. Either way the servers were efficient in getting my food, bill, and making sure the flow was good since it was a busy lunch day today."}
{"text":"Maybe the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant... ever. Food was just mediocre, but the service is what turned me off. I guess they assumed that my friend and I were \"clueless white people,\" but little did they know, my friend speaks fluent Japanese and translated the fact that they were blatantly calling us stupid when we experienced problems paying (card was declined a couple of times).   Message to owner: think twice about who you hire and how you train them. There was no reason for us to feel uncomfortable for something that wasn't our fault. I will never, ever, ever be returning and I'll be advising my friends and family against it too."}
{"text":"Eight beautifully-made crispy spicy avocado rolls, filled with mayonnaise and tempura flakes are a steal at $5.99!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for cheap and yummy sushi. They have good deals for lunch. The owner is very friendly and hospitable."}
{"text":"Sad to give such a low review but the food wasn't good, the place wasn't very clean although the service was good.   Our tea was filled often and the waiter (maybe owner?) was very friendly.   Miso soup had lots of tofu which I liked, Brown rice option available (+ $1) and the food portion is decent.   It's a shame that the food didn't taste good because the location is great.  Would not come here again since the quality and taste of food was quite disappointing. Really sorry to the nice owner tho :("}
{"text":"It's a good place to go to in a pinch, but I've had much better sushi for the same price. The food that they offer is mediocre but the facilities are clean and the service is efficient. Worthwhile if in the area but I just don't get excited if i head out there for the night"}
{"text":"Prices are different online - lower prices online by at least $2. I got the lunch Katsu Chicken special and it came to around $8.50. The rolls that came with it had salmon that had gone bad so I spit it out, the salad dressing was too sweet and it felt like you were chewing on sugar granules, the salad itself had the core of the lettuce and the lettuce was not chopped up. The only pluses was the decent chicken, though really small pieces, and the tiny bit of seaweed salad that they throw in. I will never return. Also, they only take cash and credit cards - no debit.  Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"This is a very small sushi restaurant near Yonge & St.Clair. The tables are really jammed in next to each other. I met a friend for a light lunch here. I ordered the Naruto maki and Salmon sashimi rolls. It was good. The service was okay. Servers seemed harried and distracted. Probably because we came during the busy lunch rush. I thought it was nice that they didn't push us to finish quickly as my friend and I came here to catch up after not seeing each other for a long time. So we were here for 2 hours. I also liked that they had a coat rack by the door so you could hang your coat there. Washrooms were right by the door as well. One for ladies and one for men. I'm not sure I would come back here though. I'm not often in this neighbourhood and this place is a bit too small for my taste. I'm kind of claustrophobic and prefer big open spaces."}
{"text":"We called to make a reservation, however it seems that Thursday's are not too busy.  We were seated immediately after entering the restaurant by a very pleasant waitress.  Three of us ordered from the Teppanyaki menu  and my husband ordered from the Sushi menu.  The drinks, salads and soups arrived quickly and I must say that we all enjoyed the dressing on the green salad.  The Miso soup arrived steaming and flavored perfectly.  The boys loved the sushi, making comments like \"so much better than AYCE\" and \"excellent red tuna\".   We then sat back and watched the show.  From the freshly prepared fried rice, seared salmon, shrimp and scallops and the sauteed vegetables, we were entertained.  Our chef took the time to season the courses perfectly and wait for our reaction to each dish.  If your looking for something a bit different in Newmarket, I would highly recommend trying out Sushi Garden.  Be sure to make reservations if coming on a weekend.  Tips: the table can hold 12 people, so it makes a perfect group outing."}
{"text":"First, a confession.   I lost my raw, fishy virginity at Sushi Garden.   I was working a slavish retail job a few blocks North. Traditionally, managers and staff would unwind after a rough shift by spending their paycheques at the bar next door. One day, one of the managers decided we should try something different. So we did. I was nervous, but excited. To that point I'd had a bit of a reputation for being pretty reserved (I still do, to be honest), so my colleagues were surprised when I not only joined them at the table, but made it through an impressive away of hacked-up sea creatures. I survived the surf clam and octopus (although the latter is still not one of my favourites), but tapped out at the thought of eel.   Almost fifteen years later, I find myself in the same spot for a pair of visits. One rates a solid four stars, the other a lowly two. So we'll split the difference.  Dinner begins with a steaming mug of green tea. In lieu of a proper menu, we have the take-out version spread at our place, by the paper-wrapped disposable chopsticks and napkins. Good news: prices seem frozen in time. Better news: they deliver.   We're going away the next day, so we agree to err on the simple side. We split an order of California rolls, and a shrimp tempura dinner each. The rolls are fine; well-stuffed and tightly-wrapped. Entry-level sushi, but just what the doctor ordered. Tempura is fab; precise slices of veggies ride alongside four large shrimp, all battered and fried to perfection.   The second visit took place on a Monday. Let's just say Anthony Bourdain was right about when to order fish at restaurants. Slices of tuna draped limply on a roll were generously cut, but tired grey rather than vibrant red. It's a (bad) sign of things to come when I catch the sushi chef skeptically sniffing shellfish out of the corner of my eye. We all feel a bit gamy after this meal.   Pork Katsu is tough and gristly with or without egg; the dish is more rice than protein. Chicken teriyaki looks fine; a mound of white meat and vegetables, glazed rather than glooped with sauce. Too bad the bird is stringy and difficult to chew.   I've visited many sushi spots since that initial experience, and devoured exotic species in exquisite preparations. It was a long time between visits, and the Sushi Garden menu now seems decidedly conservative. It may still be worth a visit the next time I crave basic Japanese food and don't want to pay an arm and a leg for it. After all, you never forget your first time."}

{"text":"We visited Sushi Garden for the first time.  After all the lovely reviews it was disappointing.  At 7pm on a Thursday evening, there was one other couple there who left shortly thereafter.  I'm guessing it has seen better days.  At the cooking table we were given  plastic coated, photo copies of a typed up page of available entrees.  Each was so dirty and sticky it left one worried. After deciding that we would prefer Sushi, we were escorted to a different table.  It was disappointing to hear the background music of Justin Beiber and whatever pop music one can find on a car radio. As a bonus, at least there was music. We were then presented with a 8-10 paper, photo copy of a page of many sushi choices by a server in black top who had a minimum of 4 dried \"food\"? splatters on her top.  Again, not very appetizing with regard to cleanliness.  We were not given any directions but were given a pen and so assumed we were to check off the items we wished.  As each item arrived, I guess one waits for the next one to be while eating the one just brought out? Awkward as no one had their order together.   I am not familiar with Sushi.  What I was surprised with was that we were not given plates, other than the dipping containers and so, without the fluidity of chopsticks, it even made sharing difficult. Considering that we were the only table there for the entire evening, the service can only be labeled as bad.  Eventually we were given plates after the 3rd sushi choice was brought out.  There was never a question of how it was or if we needed anything.  Finding where the server was hiding wasn't hard as while they waited for us, (server and cook) they sat at the cooking table watching a movie or something on their phone.  Several of our orders just never appeared at all.   The ones that did come out were good I might mention.  However, after having waited far too long and not willing to stay for our missing orders to eventually be made as they must have been completely forgotten, by interrupting their cell phone entertainment, we \"with some effort\" got the attention of our server and got the cheque.  $90.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   For several orders of Sushi and Water.  Although I did call the establishment the following day in order to prevent further awkwardness during the outing, they were unwilling to do anything to make me feel better.  I am not a Sushi person, but given the surroundings, the music, the completely empty establishment, the tiredness of the surroundings, etc. , ...is 30 or so odd pieces of Sushi typically $90.00????  Further, it was mostly vegetarian so not even expensive items.  I will give this place a pass for future. Service, atmosphere, pricing, customer service, all terrible.  Perhaps the stack of magazines on the table next to ours should have been a tip off."}
{"text":"Lovely Sushi place. Amazing for a quick dinner/lunch. Fish is always fresh and tasty, fast service and lots of tea (important!). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish. Fresh. The rolls are bite size, not over stuffed with rice. My fav is the snow mountain roll. Butterfish sashimi and sushi is great here too. For the price it's def good. Inside the atmosphere isn't much but service is good. We do takeout/pick up a lot, always quick and well packed. It's a neighbourhood gem!"}
