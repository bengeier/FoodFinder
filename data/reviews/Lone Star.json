{"text":"I've eaten here a fair bit over the last year. Most things have been very good. It's a chain so don't expect anything too authentic. I always enjoy the fajitas. One meal that was a disappointment was the steak. I ordered their signature steak, and paid a good sum for it. It was cooked alright, but it was probably more grizzle than meat. I'd save my money and get something else on the menu. The complimentary chips and salsa are always satisfying.

One thing I don't get is the \"Texas\" names they seem to make the staff use. I'd rather know my server's real name. I'm sorry, no one is named Thelma-Lou in this day an age."}
{"text":"I have to give this restaurant a 5! 
Their fajitas are amazing. I think what makes them great is the actually fresh made fajita made right before your eyes. 
I was there yet again this past saturday night and my server \" Ellie\" her waitress name for Lonestar was amazing! She engaged in conversation with our table so easily, she was friendly and made us feel at home. 
However whenever I come to this Lonestar I get this feeling from all the staff, they always say hello give the kids a sticker and really give you a good southern feeling!

We come back for the food and the amazing customer service!
Great addition to the newmarket area."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that has women with their jugs tattooed and hanging out just before seeing it all and pants so tight that they gots the muffin tops hanging out as well..... LONE STAR TEXAS GRILL NEWMARKET IS THE PLACE TO GO!

Now for a family man such as myself coming in with my pregnant wife and 7 month old it plays a different role.....

Fellas let me tell you if you WANT TO GET IN CRAP for doing nothing wrong and a waitress (not even our waitress) pops her puppies in front of YOU while you sit opposite of your wife...... Oh and your wife's teeth grinding back and forth ready to punch the over-friendly chick out..... GO FOR IT!

This was our 2nd visit and to be fair we came back after the first crappy experience to give it a final and fair chance.

Ordered the fajita special they are famous for.......

1. Mechanically separated chicken (they say it is fresh)
2. Ribs that fall off the bone (Boring BBQ sauce on them) and rubbery shrimp plagued our palettes with an EXCESSIVE OVER-SATURATION OF MSG!

The steak was the only redeeming item on the plate (soft like bubblegum with a nice taste)
what sat under that pile of crap was some almost sauteed onions that were soaked in oil.

They say that it is bottomless \"fixins\" that come with the meal however when we asked for another round of cheese and sour-cream it never came.

There was barely enough items on the plate to make 2 fajitas and even less toppings to cover them.

The picture in the menu is definitely not how it was presented after 45 MINUTES OF WAITING with a 7 month old and a pregnant wife patiently waiting in a restaurant that was not busy at all.

Efficiency is definitely NOT their strong suit and I believe they run defense for each other when customers are waiting past a certain time and the hooker with the jugs and exploding pants comes out to distract the man.

The last time we ordered the wings....... boring.
My wife had the steak, we have had better but the mystique grilling was almost a save for the steak.

Management both times hooked us up with coupons, a 25% discount and a free desert.
a good attempt to compensate for a disappointing meal. At least they did their best to show their concerns.

So if you single guys out there or lonely men want to spank your porkstick for 45 minutes waiting for a crappy over priced meal and over friendly hoochiemamas flop their goodies at you then THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!"}
