{"text":"...Dark in colour, the soup was somewhere between transparent and opaque; shading the sexiness that's going on inside the bowl like trying to spy on your hot neighbor taking a shower through a steamy window..."}
{"text":"La meilleure soupe tonkinoise en ville! Je vais à ce resto depuis 12 ans... toujours bon !"}
{"text":"Really good soup! Although first time I went one of the waiters was yelling quite angrily at the other employees."}
{"text":"This is the best pho bo (beef) in Montreal as of early 2016. Authentic. The broth is multilayered and really deep. When you CAN get it- you can get a side bowl of tendon to add to your soup which is worth a trip from anywhere in MTL. That is- IF they have it. The raw ingredients are always great. Sauces, cutlery etc always on the table . GREAT service! Quick and friendly!  Family vibe. Very casual. Clean. Small place.  Notable- fantastic Bonsai trees growing in every window. Just try focusing on one of those bonsais while slurping your soup and not feel like the \"Friendly Giant\" drinking \"Rusty the Rooster Stew\". I can't give 5 stars because this place is not consistent. Blow you away one day and meh the next. Also-The raw beef is not tender or thin enough to be served up as a raw/cold side dish- which they do... chew chew chew That being said- it is still the best pho in town!!!"}
{"text":"I used to (no longer live in Montreal) come here weekly for takeaways. Always the chicken rice noodle soup. It's cheap and extremely yummy. Everything (talking mainly about the vegetables) is fresh. Serving size is huge. Service is... sufficient."}
{"text":"The only Pho Ive had (with flavour) that isnt overloaded with MSG to the point where I feel sick. In fact I dont feel sick at all after eating the pho here! Literally every other pho Ive had in the city except for Hoai Huong ( which I dont like ) makes me feel sick afterwards. I've only really tried the pho and the spring roll so I cant say if the other dishes are as good. My go to pho is the one with well done flank as I find the meat to be much more tender than the raw beef."}
{"text":"This place could very be my second spot to go for an awesome Pho. I was surprised by the exceptional quality of their broth which was bursting with flavours and yumminess. The meats inside were smelling normal to my nose. Great Pho, hands down. I took #16, rare beef, tendons and tripes.   It would however lose one star and be the runner up to the so far my benchmark place, Pho Ngon for the following minor reasons. They are minor yes but noticeable nonetheless.   1- The place is smaller and feels cramped with lower ceiling than Ngon. Also, a dated decor.  2- Very clean washroom but alas, no paper towel dispenser. The roll is just sitting there naked somewhere in the corner for every person to touch it with their wet hands. Ummm, no! I'll use my own shirt and pants to pat my hands dry. 3- Same exact bowl costs $1 less at Ngon. Is it because they have a debit machine over here? Hmmm, who knows.  4- Parking is on the streets which you either have to feed the meter or park away on the residential streets or at Maxi, 2-3 blocks away but you're risking to be towed away for the latter.   Other than these minor stuff, their Pho is really good. Worth the try, you won't regret the choice."}
{"text":"My favourite pho place in town. I wouldn't say I've tried every single spot, but I personally think this one and Sen Vang are the best in the Côte des neiges area as well as in the city. From the service to the quality of food, their dac biet pho blows the hyped places in Chinatown miles away. I hope I can find something just as great back home in Vancouver."}
{"text":"Really good pho, spring rolls and decent bun, I just wish my chicken came out a bit hotter. Service was quick and abrupt, but they make a mean imperial roll."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place since we were in the neighborhood. It was a busy Friday night crowd but we managed to get the last empty table. She ordered a pho with rare beef and tendon, I had the rice plate with grilled chicken and pork chops. The broth from the pho was amazing. My chicken and pork chops were tasty and not too salty. Nice vibe, great food, will probably come back again :)"}
{"text":"When I used to take weekly piano lessons nearby, I would practically beg my mom to swing by this restaurant every time we were in the area. Everything about their pho is simply amazing, and their spring rolls are simply a must-get (unless you're allergic to nuts since there are some in the sauce). Even my mother who's the critical type with the food she eats compliments the freshness of their ingredients.   The atmosphere is very relaxed, great for bringing friends or family to chat over food. The decor is simple and clean.  Also, the pricing is wonderful for its quality; so cheap for what you get and how much you get! You shouldn't underestimate the actual bowl sizes, especially when you're a 5'2\" female like me.  This is seriously my favourite Vietnamese restaurant and I can recommend this to others with absolute confidence. Even now, whenever I have business in downtown Montreal, I make it a point to head on over after I'm done."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, a must to go if you haven't! The wait for the food is short, comes almost instantly. Super friendly staff and great atmosphere. It is very affordable and the food is splendid!"}
{"text":"They have the greatest fresh spring rolls I have found in Montreal! Generous amount of shrimps and the delicious side sauce is always warm . The broth in their soup is also delicious and all at very fair prices. All of that with some sweet authentic Vietnamese music. I posted pics of the menu so you can see their other options   The only have cash and debit (with a minimum purchase of 7.50$)"}
{"text":"Not sure why people say it's the best pho in town, IT IS NOT.   Let's start with the good. When you get a fresh bath of pho broth, it's delicious. They give plenty of meat and the XL is actually nicely sized for the price. You also don't wait too long for the food.  What I like the least is a lot of the staff. They are very loud and even sing (not well, at least in my opinion) while working. Worst of all, they talk about the customer in Vietnamese with comments like: He didn't want onions? What next, no shrimp in the roll? And starts to laughing between them. Sucks that I speak Vietnamese and had to listen to those nasty comments. They have this arrogant attitude instead of a respectful one expected from a restaurant.   The meat is plenty but is a bit dry. Especially the raw beef is shredded in small balls (happened the last 2 times I went there).   The broth used to be very strong and flavourful but these days, it seems like they add too much water so it lost its flavour!   I also get an inconsistant flavour every time I visit. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it tasteless.  Too many bad experiences so I decided to not return."}
{"text":"Pho usually tastes a bit the same to me everywhere sometimes. But Nguyen Phi, I gotta say, has a really good broth. I think I would actually drink it (which is a big no no in Pho world) all up, but I decided against it. The broth is actually slightly clear which is surprising because most pho places it's a bit murky and they use flavoring/MSG.   The only thing I'm not too keen about is pricing here. For a small I paid around 8 bucks, which is quite expensive for a small bowl of pho. Service was ok because they forgot my pho...yeah not really cool.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 3  is because their pho is pretty darn good here. I'd come back if I was in the Cote-de-Neiges neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've ever tried. Broth is delicious with is great. The service is good, although there's someone who talks a little to loud in the cash register but I'll live. 5 star if they bring the TENDON in soups back, it was so good. Affordable too!! Very filling and Pay less than 20 (appetizers+soup)"}
{"text":"While I was in the US, my sister and dad tried this little spot. She told me how much they enjoyed it and of course once I was back I knew I had to try it. I got one of their grilled chicken combos and was pleasantly surprised. The combo comes with a small soup, and the beef version had a darker broth that was aromatic and deeply satisfying. The grilled chicken itself was good, simply grilled with sesame seeds and green onion on top. The imperial rolls were tasty, and you get 2 of them! Additionally there was a green tapioca pudding that I suspect was pandan flavored. I enjoyed the not-too-sweet ending and I am oddly craving another serving since. Definite 5/5 stars and will try more of the menu options in the future."}
{"text":"Pho, when done we, is one of the most satisfying bowls of food out there. This place does a real good job. The broth is what it comes down to...and this broth has that perfect balance of sweet, salty and umami that makes a bowl of Pho special.   There are a lot of Pho places in Montreal and saying one is the best or most authentic is not a useful conversation. That said, this is excellent, service is very fast and the place is clean.  The price point here is good, $9 for a large size bowl. I also tried the papaya salad with dried beef which comes highly recommended. My 10 month old was given her first tastes of Pho here and she heartily approved !"}
{"text":"La soupe est bonne compare avec le pluspart pho de montreal..mais la place po très propre...et aussi le service est comme si comme ca..on a commander deux soupes...la serveuse âge elle a pris nos commande sans utiliser le papier et stylo,et finalement elle a tout tromper nos commandes...si tu n'a po un bon mémoire,pourquoi utilise po le stylo pour prendre le commande??"}
{"text":"I'm not from Montreal and was staying downtown but decided to make the trek to Nguyen Phi because of folks saying it was the best pho in town. Unfortunately those folks saying that were wrong and Nguyen Phi is nothing special compared to other places in the neighborhood and in Montreal.  Getting here via public transportation is a pain because it is not close to the Metro and you need to connect to a bus. I arrived around 5pm on a Thursday and the place was empty.  I got the traditional #11 Pho Dac Biet and it was cheap at c$8.99 for a XL. It took about 3min and my Pho was ready. OK sized portion but I did get the XL. Broth was OK but nothing special. Same with the noodles, beef pieces, meatballs, tripe. Service is OK. Not a bad bowl of pho but average and plain would be the best description. Also the only hot sauce they have is sriracha. I usu prefer the hot chili sauce where you can see the pepper bits.  At the end of the day, I don't recommend the journey to Nguyen Phi if you are not in the area. I actually think Sen Vang which is close by is a better Pho shop, esp the spicy beef noodles. Go there instead"}
{"text":"J'ai essayé la soupe traditionnelle.  Wow! Très bonne.  L'odeur en arrivant est magnifique!  La soupe généreuse. Goûteuse. N'hésitez pas à demander plus d'herbes, ils ont tendance à être cheap. Le service est rapide, le personnel avec une attitude correcte qui pourrait être mieux. Ambiance vivant, parfois bruyant...comme au Vietnam... Pour la nourriture, je le recommande chaudement!  Endroit: standard. D'allure propre."}
{"text":"My go to Vietnamese spot. It's beyond delicious - everything on the menu is spot on. I always get the #40 grilled chicken with imperial roll on vermicelli with salad. Or the pho for the cold days!"}
{"text":"A Vietnamese friend told us it's the best pho in Montreal so we gave it a try. Not very impressed unfortunately. It was OK. Soup was quite plain and not very rich. The summer rolls were pretty dry for whatever reason. We were a little disappointed. But overall it was not bad."}
{"text":"Come here on a Sunday during lunchtime ... and it feels like you're stepping back in time ... into another world in faraway Southeast Asia. The clientele and staff chatting in Vietnamese (switching effortlessly to and from French and English); the authentic Vietnamese food; the dessert... This is a quaint place and certainly worth coming back.  Try the grilled fish... Awesome! I don't see this often in other pho places.   For dessert, try the tri-color - a coconut iced drink with red beans and grass jelly."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by some vietnamise friends and I have to say that it's excellent. I had the soup (M4A) with beef and the taste was great.   It is also very cheap"}
{"text":"Favorite Pho in the city, all home made, with some great side dishes which the girl behind the cash register informed me her 'mother made'. Try the dry beef and papaya salad or the lemon sashimi - you'll be in for some unique flavors and treats."}
{"text":"Love places like this - nondescript, dark, crowded, fresh smells coming from the kitchen, hushed servers, dinky repetitive 'world' music playing over and over..  Food is excellent, dried beef salad was a WTF moment of flavorful goodness, the pho was complex, rich but light at the same time.  Well played."}
{"text":"Nothing special, tried the soup and the roll, not as good as I had in Ottawa, will not come gain."}
{"text":"Amazing pho. One of my favourite place in the city. The imperial rolls are amazing !!! The staff is nice and they serve your order in seconds. Definitely worth a visit !!!"}
{"text":"I eat pho everywhere I can.  I've had it all over the world. This is the first time I have ever experienced pho where the broth was so perfect that I added nothing to it.  No hoisin, no sriracha, no bean sprouts, nothing.  It was incredible.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and stayed strong until the very last bite.  I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly.  It is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Tried this place on Saturday evening. I'm giving it four stars based on price. I think there prices are pretty good for a Vietnamese restaurant and they do have good variety. I'll also give them the four stars based on the amount of meat they put on the special soup. This seems like a family based restaurant and is running quite well! The food itself was pretty good, but I do have other favorite Vietnamese restaurants elsewhere in Montreal. But it didn't hurt to try!"}
{"text":"Love the pho, the best in my opinion. The staff is super friendly and we go there so often that it actually feels like we eat at a friend's house now lol  they also have a super good avocado milkshake and a the \"3 colors\" is pretty tasty !"}
{"text":"This review will be short. Delicious soups! Delicious vietnamese dishes. My favourite is the phnom pen soup. You gotta give it a try! Very friendly service and reasonably priced. Worth the detour!"}
