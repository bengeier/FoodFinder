{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant in my neighborhood.  Always have a delicious meal and great service. Dined on the 7th and Maleshah took very good care of us. The meal was amazing and our service was delightful. We always recommend this one to friends and any time we have guests visit we enjoy bringing them here. It's never let us down."}
{"text":"We have been a long time customer and eat here just about every weekend.  The service staff is great. Since the new management has taken over seems like the wait, non peak time, has gotten longer.  Several time there are areas of empty tables - under staffed?  They have removed my favorite meal since moving to First Watch direction.  Delivery of meals has also gotten longer."}
{"text":"I go to the Good Egg every weekend. The food is incredible. I've noticed a lot of changes since they have been bought out my First Watch. The new menus are pretty good but the atmosphere is changed. It's no longer a nice laid back old school breakfast place. The servers do an excellent job and smile but when they aren't talking to customers they don't look very happy. I enjoyed my food for about an hour with my wife and in that hour all I heard and saw was drama. You could hear the new manager yelling in the kitchen at someone, which I thought was a little unprofessional. I also don't agree with gossip in the work place however I feel bad for the servers. I was sitting by the front and all me and my wife heard was girls talk about how disrespectful the manager was in her approach to them. I would say its gossip but when you hear six girls upset on the same day there has to be something wrong with the manager. I also noticed our wait time to get sat was ridiculously long and there was a bunch of empty tables. The manager was just standing around and didn't acknowledge us or apologize for the wait. Over all I love the Good Egg but if rude managers with upset servers ranting is what they promote I can't see myself coming here. I used to be a manager and I would never disrespect my employees or allow them to gossip."}
{"text":"Delicious place.  I like a breakfast joint.  Chugging down restaurant coffee (theirs is good) and stuffing down omelets... or pancakes... whatever's your preference.

Waitstaff is all really good, at least in my experience, and the food tastes better than mass produced corporate/franchise restaurants.

I'd definitely go back because there's so much to try!  All kinds of delicious foods made out of healthy non-white-flour ingredients.  But a little extra syrup... yeah, I'd go that small mile.  (They have organic maple, too!).

Ask they waitstaff if the animal you ate had a name.  Then say a silent prayer of recognition and thanks for that animal.  Right?  Everyone gets a kick out of that!

Thanks Good Egg!"}
{"text":"Love the good egg! Been going for about ten years and this our new fav location. Dependable deliciousness by friendly staff. Yay!"}
{"text":"Call ahead seating is available in which  we did use, arrived there waited only about 5 minutes and we were seated. Service was wonderful,  great attitude by the waitress  even though  she was very busy,   after all it was Mothers Day, but she always had a smile, and very polite. The food was wonderful , we took the whole family and tried everything from 2 skillets, eggs Benedict,  pancakes and biscuits n gravy. They don't skimp on anything,  huge piece of ham , good bacon, and the biscuits are  HUGE and very tasty, especially with some honey....We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Fast service, great food and always smiling faces. My friends and I eat here all the time and we are never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is always great. The kitchen staff is on the ball all the time. Not long wait for hot food. The servers rock. Manager Marcus is very friendly and willing to assist anytime."}
{"text":"i eat at the good egg all the time.  service is always speedy and the food is great.  Everything on the menu is wonderful put my favorite are the wheat pancake with strawberries."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast, was told there was a 25 minute wait. Found 8 open tables on the patio and 1 server only had 2 tables ?????? BS! Spoke with the manager (Fran?)
She said there were more people before me. Why the He ll are there 8 open tables and 1 server only has 2 tables while the rest have 5 -7 tables? apparently this manager doesn't know wth she is doing!!!"}
{"text":"The food outstanding. And the staff is even better. We arrived and it was very busy, but the wait was minimal. The host staff was friendly and helpful. Great job."}
{"text":"I was at the Good Egg earlier this week and had such great food! The survice was eggceptional, especially Anna the hostess"}
{"text":"Can we say YUM!!!!! Wow this place is now one of my top favorite breakfast places to go to! Food was amazing ! I had their biscuits and gravy, home style potatoes, 2 over medium eggs. Everything was cooked to perfection!!! Keith was out server & he was great! Amazing personality. Great recommendations on food!!! I like how he left pitchers on the table so we didn't have to wait to have out drink refilled. I will be back !!! This is by far my favorite breakfast place I've ever been to!!!!!  
They have inside and outside seating. 
I'm trying trying to type more because yelp is stating that my post is average in length;however, I really only needed to put that this place is a MUST GO !! :)"}
{"text":"The prices at this place are ridiculous. They charge $4.50 for 1 pancake and the quality is sub-standard, several tiers below grocery store pancake mix; in the category of a failed home cooking experiment. Even if I was a billionaire I couldn't eat here as it would entail a contradiction; you don't get what you pay for, plain and simple.  

It's a sad state when the supply and demand market equilibrium of the Mesa restaurant economy allows this place to stay in business; perhaps people in Mesa, AZ have low culinary standards, but I think people should demand more for their money."}
{"text":"After coming here for the last 5 years, this place has gone extremely down hill in the last year. Today, I called and place a to go order at 1030. I was told to be there in 15 minutes to pick it up. After getting there at 1045, I had to wait inside an additional 30 minutes (all while walk in customers were being seated left and right). When I went up front to ask big Kayla if my order was ready yet, she rudely willed her eyes and told me to \"give us a couple more seconds for my pancakes.\" Finally, at 1130, 60 minutes after I placed my order, Kayla comes out with my order and says absolutely nothing to me. My New Years resolution is to never come back to this dump."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in this area .I love they upgrade jams and  real butter , best pancakes a bbc.cos d if you want healthy, the egg whites omelet is fantastic great coffee, great portion , family friendly"}
{"text":"The reopening was better than I expected.  Staff was well organized and they understood  the new menu.  I had the breakfast tacos and they were delish. 

Like the remodel, very open vibe.  This will still be one of my favorite bfast spots."}
{"text":"Ok, so I want to be clear that this review is only directed at this location (Val Vista and Baseline), as I'm generally happy with the Good Egg in most respects. However, I have now eaten at this location twice and have found the food to be subpar and the service very poor. I ate there last weekend and first, it took forever for us to get coffee, which is pretty important on a Sunday morning, and to make matters worse, they just barely filled our pot enough for two cups, so we were immediately asking for more. 

I had the Hog Wild skillet, which is something I've ordered before and enjoyed. This time however, it was seriously cold, like weirdly so, and the potatoes were totally undercooked. To me, undercooked potatoes are pretty much the biggest food disappointment ever so nothing could save the meal"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Restaurant was clean, food was fresh, staff very friendly and knowledgeable ."}
{"text":"Always excellent food & service. I have gone there with friends  for several years and its always busy. There is a waiter who I love because he is upbeat and makes the visit so pleasurable. The restaurant provides punch card individually so after 7 meals  you get one free.  It's not just breakfast but lunch as well. I think they close st 2:30."}
{"text":"Great food, great service good coffee!  They also have extra sides that can be added to your meal for a buck!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast recently.  Restaurant was half full, ambiance about what you would expect.
Food was ok, nothing to write home about but not bad either.
Service to the table was good.  Otherwise, it was weird.  During a 30 minute time frame there were two incidents of some kind of commotion at the check out about the bill or being seated.  Not sure what caused either but I did notice that the girls gathered around the front had a few laughs and comments about each one of those patrons and it was not endearing.  I heard portions of the second incident and the  workers were really not nice nor appreciative of the customer.  When it came my turn  to pay the bill I had the tip added but have a strong feeling my waiter will never see it and he was the one positive about this place.
Cleanliness:  seemed okay on the surface but there was a strong soiled rag smell and it got stronger as they were clearing the tables.  Can the busboy not smell that?
Overall:  seemed like quite a few workers for the amount of customers, and idle time is not helping this business."}
{"text":"Ironically, as a cook, I can honestly say this place has really good EGGS. I haven't eaten at the restaurant yet but I order food to go weekly on my way to work. Monica, is always friendly and helpful with suggestions and goes all out with making sure nothing is missing in the take out order. They give a military discount with ID which I appreciate and I like their stamp program which provides a free meal after 7 orders. DOUBLE STAMPS on Mondays!"}
{"text":"It's no wonder this place is always crowded. I love the food here. Great place to come for breakfast on the weekends. If you don't wanna wait for a table, come early."}
{"text":"Very good, although most of out you could make yourself at home. The oreo pancakes are always a hit."}
{"text":"Great food ~ good service. The coffee isn't very good though. Sometimes I grab a Starbucks just a few doors down and bring it with me then it is a perfect breakfast. Great omelets.

There is often a group ~ especially on weekends.  Always happoy to see places being blessed this way ~ Blessings to them for continued success.  : ) KC"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best places to eat in the valley. My wife introduced it to me while we were dating and it became a theme for our weekly activities. This wonderful place serves excellent food that can satisfy any craving from sugary delights of the cinnamon rolls to the meaty filler of the Lumberjack skillet. They even offer a variety of healthy choices  that will send you  into the day with energy and no regrets.  The food is is great and reasonably priced (especially if you take advantage of double stamp day).

 I must add that it isn't only the food that keeps drawing me back to this delectable  restaurant. Simply put it is the people. From the beginning of my experience here I have been constantly impressed by the manner in which the staff conduct themselves. They are friendly courteous; one might even say benevolent, but most of all professional. They serve in a way that is exemplary, quick, efficient, and experienced. This is where I want to go after a weeks toil to sit back relax, enjoy a fine meal, while being pampered just enough to go on feeling uplifted as if a little hop had been added into my every step. 

Eat here

Sincerely"}
{"text":"I ate here with my family a few months ago and had a very poor experience. I wrote the corporate office a letter sharing my disappointment. I received a letter last week from the district manager offering her apologies and sincere sentiments. I was very impressed that I received an acknowledgment letter, and they even sent me a few coupons to boot. 

They won me back as a fan and now I know they are listening and anticipating the needs of the customer. My family and I will be returning there to eat more frequently now. Thank you Good Egg for listening and responding to your customers needs!"}
{"text":"My family loves The Good Egg! There is always several items on the menu you can't decide on having. I love that they give you a choice to have strong coffee and it comes in a carafe for your table.  Also the fact you can leave there satisfied and not feel like you ate a pound of grease is pretty great too!"}
{"text":"Another great breakfast/brunch restaurant in AZ! This and the Henhouse Cafe cannot be topped. I wouldn't be able to compare the two. I would just have to make both a local place to eat when I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"There are very few restaurants in the East Valley that give you nutritional/ calorie information for all of their menu items, and that is just  ONE of the reasons we like The Good Egg! Our favorite menu items are their Healthy One Crepes with the chicken breast, broccoli, and spinach that is topped with a light Hollandaise sauce...and the ( not so healthy but super delish) Lumberjack potato skillet with potatoes, bacon, sausage, ham, mushrooms and cheese topped with eggs. Not only is their food very good but their servers are always friendly and food prep is fast. If you want to go to a restaurant that has consistently good food and service, this is the place....and they have punch cards -one punch per visit so you can enjoy a free meal once in a while!"}
{"text":"One complaint. I ordered over medium eggs and they came well done. But everything else was great. Awesome service. We had JJ and she was so friendly. Newly remodeled place as well. Very nice set up. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Good Egg and have been to numerous locations. Val Vista location was clean and bright with a very cheerful atmosphere. I was greeted upon arrival and was promptly sat and serves coffee. The food and service were excellent. My kids and I enjoyed the pumpkin pancakes and a traditional breakfast. The chicken Apple sausage was a nice surprise. I am really enjoying their new menu items."}
{"text":"Enjoying our free anniversary breakfast!  Love this place.

Our go to breakfast stop.  Up @5am so we decided to treat ourselves.  Not as busy as the weekend.

One of our favorite breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Awesome friendly wait staff, great customer service and food!!! Really enjoyed the steak and eggs, cooked perfectly!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE the good egg!! Keith is the best, always brightens up my day! One of my favourite breakfast places"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place around here, for sure. Staff is always friendly and on to of their game. Plenty of menu choices and the food is always great."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast this morning - avocado and toast yum!  I should have taken a photo because it was picture perfect, worthy of a menu display, but that's nothing new here!  I believe Stacy was the name of my waitress - she was just the right amount of attentive and prompt with everything. Very friendly as well. Even though I was by myself, casually reading news articles and enjoying my meal, I never once felt rushed. Random side note: the coffee was so much better this go around, which is a MUST. Very satisfied today."}
{"text":"I am not really a fan of breakfast places but this place was great. My omlette had tons of stuff in inside, the prices were reasonable (you can add bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc to any meal for $1 each). The menu is huge, the company I was with had a chicken salad sandwich, biscuits with gravy, and mushroom caps smothered with cheese. Everyone loved their meal and cleaned their plate. 

The wait time was 10 minutes for a party of 5. They always seem busy on the weekends and close around 2 so get there early!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I love this place. I'm a huge breakfast person so when I first ate here I fell in love. The food is soooo good. I usually get the Lumberjack Skillet and let me tell you, you won't be disappointed. The french toast is some of the best I have found here in the Valley and the kids menu is great. My son always has plenty to eat and I even get to eat his leftovers. My only complaint is that the past few times I have eaten there, the wait staff forget to ask if we need a box. Other than that, it's great. I have never experienced an extremely long wait to be seated or receive my food. I highly recommend this place to all the breakfast lovers out there."}
{"text":"First time here.  

I asked to be seated in an area without ceiling fans and they accommodated me. 

I asked for water w/o lemons and they bring a water pitcher to the table....so AWESOME!

I got the biscuits and gravy meal.  I asked for the eggs: basted/medium.  They didn't come out that way, as the pic shows.  It's OK because I stole bread off my boyfriends' plate and gave him one of my HUGE biscuits/gravy,lol.  The meal was still delicious. We got a side of bacon.  The bacon is thick, long, and extra salty.  Think beef jerky.  My boyfriend loved it and I didn't.  I think next time, I will ask for the bacon not to be cooked well done.

My boyfriend got a ham and cheese omelet.  It was fabulous.  Coffee was great.  He also loved the biscuits and gravy off my order, lol.

Service was great.  'A little too \"happy\"  for so early in the morning,' said Mr. Grumpy Pants but that was before he had his first cup of coffee in the morning.  I thought the waiter's happiness level was appropriate (I don't need coffee to wake up) and he made sure to check in regularly.  I thought the staff went out of their way to make sure everyone was happily satisfied.  I watched them and they seemed to be quick to make sure turnover kept the wait reasonable.  

This would have been 5 stars if my food had came out correctly.  Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while so decided to try it out. Service was great but the food wasn't what I remembered. Potatoes were cold. It was a weekday so not busy so don't understand why the food was cold. Not sure I'll choose The Good Egg again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I have been to in Mesa. The service was quick. I loved how they left a pot of coffee at your table, so you didn't have to wait for a refill. I had the four peaks french toast and it was YUMM-azing. My husband had the regular egg/bacon/potatoes and he loved it. We recently had a bad experience at Denny's and realize that cheap does not equal quality... This place far exceeds the Denny's experience and it was still under $20 for the two of us to eat. Would highly recommend. Nice outdoor seating too! Parking lot is a little cramped."}
{"text":"Lumberjack skillet is the Bomb-Diggity. Great Breakfast. Went on Sunday AM and we were seated very quickly. Brock our server was very polite, efficient, and friendly and kept the refills coming. We will positively be back to this great service, food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I go there on Sundays after church
Sure it is crowded but the food more than makes up for it!
I love the cold sweet tea they put outside while you wait!!

I usually get the avocado omelette and add some stuff to it

I just love eating here!"}
{"text":"The waitress Ellen was AWESOME!!! Funny and thorough. She was a gem and she will be the reason why we return next time we visit the Phoenix area along with the great skillets and piping hot food, freshly made!!! Thanks Ellen for making our visit memorable."}
{"text":"Don't ever eat here. We walked in Saturday morning. There were about 10 tables open on the patio. We told hostess we wanted to sit outside and she said 15 minutes.  Why I have no idea except she was trying to load up her friends section instead of seating open tables.  Told her to piss off and we went to IHOP across the street. Sat immediately and awesome food."}
{"text":"Great food and that is clearly known because it takes a bit to get seating in the morning, that's pretty much my only complaint is getting a table can take forever comparatively. Other than that great breakfast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. No wait time since it was later in the morning on the weekday. Couldn't get a waitress to help us, but the whole restaurant was like that. Lots of waitresses running around, but not helping anyone... Weird! I kept seeing other tables flagging down anyone who would walk by. I saw an older gentleman accidentally flag down a customer. Poor guy! Their website is apparently out dated, cause we tried to order something we saw from the website & she said they didn't have that anymore. Oookay..... 
There were 5 people in our party & all our food was super dry!!! So it wasn't an isolated incident... It must just be how they cook their food! We choked down the ham, potatoes, & eggs... Lots of water & ketchup helps!! :/ We certainly won't go back!"}
{"text":"We rarely give less than 4 stars since we usually frequent 4 star-and-up Yelp reviewed restaurants. The service here was great, the establishment was clean. The food was sub-par. The toast was cold, their menu selections were minimal and the omelette was flat and not fluffy. My wife thought her potatoes were over cooked.

This place isn't awful and would rate at about the same level as a \"Denny's\". If you want a fantastic breakfast, try any \"US Egg\". https://useggrestaurant.com"}
{"text":"I had a veggie skillet and it wasn't hot at all. All the veggies were soggy and cold I'm really disappointed because the whole menu looked delicious."}
{"text":"Keith is the best server! Food is usually always hot even when its busy. They stopped thestamp cards ?"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast/brunch place with energetic friendly staff, quick service, fulfilling the tons of Diet Coke quota/minute as is apparently typical for AZ, and a good menu of breakfast variations: found the perfect after workout meal with egg whites, salsa, turkey, and black beans.   Little pricey for the quality but really fulfilled the purpose and hit the spot."}
{"text":"Well there's generally a decent wait to get in for breakfast it's probably the best choice within a mile to two mile radius without having to go to downtown Gilbert and fight all the soccer moms for a plate of breakfast the staff is generally friendly and the food is always good now if they could just figure out the parking situation over there that would be great LOL"}
{"text":"I will definitely be back again! I was greeted promptly by a host and server and seated promptly. I ordered Eggs Benedict and French Toast and the portions were huge. My server Jess was kind and extremely helpful since it was my first time visiting. Overall, a great experience from the food to customer service. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago and the place had the air conditioning blasting even though it was cool outside. Kind of pricey for what my husband and I got especially when you consider I could have bought a pound of bacon for what they charge. Decent food nothing to write home about.. Courteous and good waitress though."}
{"text":"I will give 3 stars only because of the service, the food is average at best I had cornbeef hash which was fair my eggs were served in a separate dish one of the yokes broke and sloshing around in the water of the serving boat  my wifes  omlet was ok but not very hot  she said her potatoes were uninspiring."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast no matter what you pick, can't go wrong and the coffee is always good - service efficient."}
{"text":"I think their food is nothing special.  In fact, I'd prefer iHop."}
{"text":"Amazing... that's it, the end. You really need not say anymore.
The service is wonderful, friendly and fast.
The food is to... die... for. Comes out quick and hot... not to mention, tastes so fresh!
My family and I frequent this place almost every weekend and have NEVER had a bad experience.

TIP: Utilize their call-ahead seating!"}
{"text":"Sadly, TGE has declined since the early 90's. Hadn't been there for years and decided to try again today, but doubt I'll be back. A lot of \"pros\", but they don't stack up against the one big \"con\":
Pros:  
Seated promptly; friendly staff in person and on the phone.
Surroundings are comfortable and pleasant.
Courteous and prompt service throughout the meal.
Order cooked correctly; eggs as requested, etc.
Generous portions; definitely enough to bring home.
Cinnamon roll was great, and enormous.
Con: 
BLAND FOOD.  Always order the Pueblo skillet, which I had today. Added more seasoning after getting home, but even that with the salza that comes with the meal can't conceal the fact that you are adding flavor after the fact. How can green chilis and chorizo come out anything but flavorful? Not sure, but it started to happen years ago and it hasn't changed back for the better.  Would love to find a regular spot again to enjoy a leisurely midmorning breakfast, but this just isn't the place--at least not for these tastebuds."}
{"text":"Loved the biscuits and gravy plate! Biscuits were so fluffy and moist!! Tasty gravy! And had the option of a stronger cup of coffee...I like that!"}
{"text":"This is a great little breakfast place with lots of options to choose from. If you're going to come in the morning on a weekend you need to either get here really early or much later. Around 9-11 it is packed and their is a wait. 

Service is always really friendly and the food is very affordable. It has a neat little breakfast atmosphere to it with lots of open windows and that combined with the delicious coffee help to wake you up. We ate here many times when I lived in Mesa. 

Before I became gluten free my favorite thing to get was the banana chocolate chip pancakes. They are huge, enough to feed three people! The bacon is also delicious and the orange juice tastes very fresh. After I discovered I had a gluten allergy I was disappointed to find out I was much more limited. Even the appearing innocent bacon and scrambled eggs had gluten (from the egg substitute) so there is not nearly as much to enjoy here if you are gluten intolerant. If you are gluten free and looking for some good breakfast places check some of my other reviews

Overall, I definitely recommend this place for a good breakfast, especially if you don't have any allergy limitations."}
{"text":"Super cute decor
Friendly staff
Delicious breakfast
Great coffee 
Seriously my favorite place to go!!! 
Warm and cozy feel"}
{"text":"Love love love their banana pancake and bacon. Mmmm. Great place for breakfast that is always good."}
{"text":"Get there really early or shoot for a late lunch to avoid the lines! 

This place is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Mesa. They have a variety of healthy And delicious choices. The staff is always friendly and the service is prompt. I recommend the power house if your a meat lover like myself! If your on the other side of the spectrum try the vegan soup (us meat lovers think it's delish). If you get there between 9-11am you can expect a 15-30 min wait. They have self serve coffee outside for those who are waiting or u can run over to starbucks and grab some coffee/tea. Happy Mornings start with Eggs!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The food is fresh and always perfectly prepared. The fresh juice drinks are unique and refreshing. You can't go wrong here whether you get an egg dish, pancakes, crepe dish or salad all ate delicious. Wait staff are very pleasant, knowledgeable and not overly attentive; a nice balance. Restaurant is clean and so are the bathrooms."}
{"text":"I highly recommend huevos rancheros breakfast with over easy eggs. 

Good service, friendly staff and tastes good. Next time I'm in Arizona I'll stop in again for sure."}
{"text":"So I am going to let you in on a secret, sometimes (meaning once a week) I drop my kids off at school, ignore my other responsibilities for the morning and  go to The Good Egg for breakfast. I always know what to expect, great service, great food and great prices. They have yet to let me down. Can't wait for school to start again, so I can get back to playing hooky and hang out at The Good Egg."}
{"text":"Good food. A little higher prices than most breakfast places. Clean. Always busy. Good coffee. Parking a bit challenging at this location."}
{"text":"I ate here last Thursday morning, and I enjoyed it. I was seated immediately, and after asking what I would like to drink, which was coffee and water, my drinks were promptly delivered. I ordered the Macho Nacho, and it was delicious. I will be back again to try other selections on the menu."}
{"text":"The food was okay and delightful. We waited for about 10 minutes. For a cheap meal this is the place to go. Noticed a lot more senior citizens around here."}
{"text":"My son and I come in every Monday as our buddy breakfast, great staff, good food, and warm reception.  Only complaint is the parking situation but they can't control that with building."}
{"text":"Panini sandwich was on the wrong kind of bread and very greasy and soggy mush, fruit platter was scattered fruit on a bed of wilted lettuce for 10 bucks. I asked for no butter on my toast and it had butter. The best thing was the bottled hot sauce on the table. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very good! The service was fast and efficient! Food was great. The traditional breakfast was on point and so was the berry Amor pancakes. I like how fresh everything tasted. The crepes were good as well. Definitely coming back again. More creamer though please! :)"}
{"text":"So far this has been my go to for all things eggalicious.
The food is fresh and tasty and the service is pretty consistent.

I highly recommend the \"La Casa Potencia\"  which is a protein packed dream.
Grilled chicken, egg whites, fresh veggies and beans on the side.  Tortilla too if you're a wheat-eater.

I just moved to Phoenix a few weeks ago, and I have been here at least twice a week.

I should probably order something different next time!!"}
{"text":"So I have been coming here off and on for years. I just forget to leave a review, don't know why?? Anyway, me and my wife like coming here on weekdays, weekends are really busy, this is a very popular place. Love the omelets, and pancakes are very good. Great staff {5-Stars} If you have coffee, they bring you your own pot, nice touch!  Now I am a picky eater, so the one thing I don't care for are the potatoes that come as a side with most breakfast orders. They are mushy, not really crisp, not my style, not seasoned, just plain. One more thing, is the seating. There is no soft seats in this place. All booths are wooden benches. If you have back issues like me, then a long time here on your behind, might cause a bit of pain in ye'ol back. That being said, of course I will be back!!!!! another plus to this place is they have a stamp card, and every meal you purchase, you get a stamp. After 7 stamps you get a free meal, and ion Mondays, you get 2 stamps per meal, this is a great deal!! So i have to give a big Woo Hoo!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for 6+ years now.  Low turnover on the staff, which tells a lot about the management. You will see the same waiters and waitresses if you continue to go there. The food is always exceptional.  I've never had a reason to complain.  It can get busy on a Sunday morning with the church crowd, so expect to wait for a little bit.

My favorite is the Berry Blintz (Crepes) with no whip cream.  Amazing!

On busy days they offer free coffee outside with flavored creamers.  Definitely my favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"We visit this location 3 to 4 times a month. Love the food and the staff  is fantastic. Always friendly"}
{"text":"The Good Egg restaurants are always hot spots for weekend morning breakfast.  We decided to go Sunday around 11:30 and had about a 1/2 hour wait.  It is always worth the wait!
I ordered the eggs over medium, turkey sausage and one chocolate chip pancake.  You can put an infinite number of items in your pancakes!  Mine had just the right amount of ccs in it.  The turkey sausage tastes like homemade - wonder if I can bribe them for the recipe?
M had scrambled eggs with bacon and one whole wheat pancake.  The buttermilk chocolate chip one I had was WAY better, but he is trying to eat his favorite foods made in a more healthy way.  The waitress was Jena and she was super sweet.  She checked up on us the right amount of times, refilled M' s iced tea, and brought me more creamer right away when asked.  
We have eaten here before, and the food is always really good.  They have a very diverse menu of breakfast and lunch items.  It is cute how they have a Wildcat item and a Sun Devil item named after the two major universities located here in AZ.  Go for breakfast, go for lunch, just GO!"}
{"text":"Good Service, Good Food! Perfect for a pre-cardinals game breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is a must! The best breakfast I have ever had. I ordered the Lumberjack Skillet and WOW, you get everything you could want in a breakfast. The staff is very friendly and do their job very well.  Please go here if you want amazing breakfast for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We waited about 15 mins on a Sunday am around 10.  Not too bad.   We were seated and coffee and water soon followed.  Fresh juice looked amazing but we did not order.  Coffee was bold and hot. I had 2 egg breakfast with cinnamon French toast.  Light and fluffy and delicious!   Hubby has the breakfast Sammie on sourdough.  Very good as well.  Server was sweet but kitchen was running a bit behind."}
{"text":"I came into this a Good egg restaurant and felt welcomed right away. I could not ask for better service and the roast beef and havarti sandwich was great!! I would recommend this place for anyone."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I absolutely loved it! Reasonably priced and portions are pretty large! I, myself, ordered the Sunrise Benedict and was simply blown away with how delicious it was! Not only that, the hot tea they serve was amazing! Service was quick and servers are very friendly! This place exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic, affordable and the service is amazing. Ellen is the best server!"}
{"text":"Five stars on the service alone today; I really wish that I remembered our waitresses name, but she was the cutest bundle of happiness way too early in the morning! Awesome service, super helpful in our order, and down right genuinely happy.

Food- five stars. Had the Healthy One (as always, I'm a subject of habit at the Good Egg) with a side of dollar pancakes. Delish.

The Man had the Farmhouse; his words were silenced by the eating. He ate every bite than moved onto my leftovers. 

Devoured the pancakes like they were going out of style, woofed down my english muffins because they have blackberry jelly, and had four cups of Irish Cream coffee, A-mazing. 

One piece of advise, ALWAYS order the flavored coffee of the day. And if they have chocolate chip please message me; I'm in dire need of a fix!"}
{"text":"Mmmm mmm good!  After going today I'm mad at myself for not going sooner because I've been missing out!  I ordered the Monterey omelet which is 3 egg whites, turkey meat, bacon, tomato, avocado and cheese and it comes with country potatoes and an english muffin.  All of those things were DELICIOUS!  The textures and flavors of the omelet just blended perfectly together, soooo good!  The country potatoes were awesome as well, a little crispy on the outside but still soft and fluffy on the inside and they had a great flavor as well.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it again so all I can say is go check it out yourself!"}
{"text":"After visiting this place a few more times, they have improved. The service has been great, and the food has been consistently better than before. Now really my only complaint is the three pages of rules that govern their frequent diners card. Every other place I eat at often you get a stamp per entree you purchase, and you can combine cards. The Good Egg is a little more picky, and only gives one stamp per visit, and you cannot combine cards."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat for breakfast on a weekend! The wait times can get long at times but they accept call ins so we end up waiting 5 minutes at most for a table. The servers are always so nice, I've been here at least 15 times and have never once had an issue with any servers or hostesses. They're really great! And the food is just to die for. My husband always gets eggs Benedict, and it's always perfect. I've gotten numerous things on the menu and have only been disappointed once. It was something with chorizo in it which I don't normally likebut I thought maybe it would be good there,I've definitely had worse though. My favorite is the bacodo omelet. Mmmm now I'm hungry lol"}
{"text":"I really like going here for a quick but really yummy breakfast.  It has a variety of options.  It would be nice if they had more Gluten free options, that's the only reason it didn't get 4 stars. Really good egg scramble combinations."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I was not impressed. I ordered my usual breakfast... Bacon, eggs over easy, and hash browns. The eggs were way over cooked and the hash browns were burnt. 

That experience aside, it's close, so I checked it out again. The castroville omelette is my go to at The Good Egg. Soooo good! Spinach, mushrooms, onion, tomato, artichoke hearts, and jack cheese. Get it! 

They are open from 6:30am - 2:30pm. It's generally chilly inside, so bring a sweater unless you like cooler temps."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful staff! The food is good too. I love the Hot Juan Burrito, and the pancakes are also great. I have found the French toast a bit dry. The dining area is large and bright. It's very welcoming. I highly recommend The Good Egg."}
{"text":"I have to start off with its a Sunday with a large group so the wait time of 20 min was not at all bad. Took my grandson to the restroom when an employee came in. I have to say she needs to be retrained cause when she exited the stall she didn't wash her hand but maybe 10 seconds. The other concerning thing is I didn't see her use any soap. Even though she was one seating people she is still transferring bacteria onto the menu. Waited a very long time for the food but it came out hot. For that reason I cannot give more that two stars. Hygiene in the customer service department is huge."}
{"text":"It is only lacking the 5th star for the prices. They are a little too high for the amount of food - but the quality and service are the best you can find anywhere for breakfast food. 
 
I went on a friday morning around 10:30 and still had a wait. I am told to expect a wait no matter what. Its a very good idea to check this place out if you are around town."}
{"text":"The price is cheap but my food came out cold.  Cold eggs = fear of salmonella.  I am definately a fan of breakfast food but I came out disappointed.  The orange juice was fresh at least."}
{"text":"Had the sunrise Benedict,  with turkey and avacodo and it was horrible.   Last time for me here.   Service was friendly however breakfast for 2 $35 is a bit over the edge for me.   Poor value for poor food but with good service."}
{"text":"Keith is awesome!  So nice and friendly. Checked on us enough but not too much. Knew my order after only serving on me once before.  Food was hot and perfectly made, exactly as I specifically ordered. So inexpensive, excellent food with amazing service. Ya I recommend!"}
{"text":"Eggcited about their Buttermilk Pancakes!!

The only thing I remember was their pancakes! They're butterlicous good!! The buttermilk pancakes are so rich in flavor, the whole thing's practically butter, but its just so darn goooooood! 

Eggs and bacon were standard -- tastes like you can make 'em @ home.

Great Customer service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. When we first walked in we were never greated and once we finally were the hostess says to us ummm whats your name.. we responded.. she  immidetly said okay well you dont have to stand by me just go sit down .. as we were simply just waiting to her to tell us a wait time like hostess usally do.  An older lady waited on us. When we first arrived she asked if she could get us anything we politely said no thank you we are waiting for two more people so then she immidetly grabs us a pitcher of water and coffee and asked if we were ready to order again we responded with no we said we are waiting for two more and she said yes but i am very busy we told he no thank u and she walked away. As soon as our other party arrived it took her four glances at us to final come and take our order once she did she was very rude and passive aggressive. When our food came out it was very cold and there was a long gray hair in my eggs she reluctantly tryed to take it back to be remade.. When i brought the hair to her attention she goes \" well its not mine\"ill just have them make you new eggs and gave the plate back to me I then said no could you please have them remake the whole plate. After that was over and done with she never checked on us again until our check was brought to us and that took another hour dealing with due to over charged items she had put on our ticket that we never ordered."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant, friendly staff.
Food was okay,pancake was not the best.
I was charged over $10 for 1 pancake and a side of bacon. Seems excessive."}
{"text":"Always too notch service. We've been coming here for years. I no longer live in town but every time I'm in the area I bring the kids here for breakfast!  They love it!   Have never had an issue with the food or service in all the years!  Great family place."}
{"text":"Great omelettes! I love going here. Kids gets the Mickey and Minnie pancakes.. Very cute! Everything I've tried is amazing except eggs bene. They have fresh squeezed juice that is delicious! Usually a wait on the weekend, but you can walk right in during weekdays. Took my friend there a month ago and we've been make three times already."}
{"text":"The Good Egg wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either. I would definitely compare it to an IHOP. There was no charm or character to the restaurant. The food was decent, but just a regular omelet. I'm happy we tried it out, but I don't think it's worthy of returning."}
{"text":"NO, This place is nothing like Eggingtons! This eatery has a pumped up Denny's atmosphere. The food is definately better than Denny's to be completely fair. Ive been here a few times and the service has always been good,  food always hot and I'll more than likely go back again sometime but it's not my first choice.  I can't even remember what I had there last time."}
{"text":"Service decent, food bleh.  I can't figure out why my food tasted burnt, as it wasn't burnt.  I had the egg creps light, basically egg white omlette and it had zero flavor, will except for that burnt flavor.  Hubby had eggs and hash and said it was so so.  $45.00 later and we were less than impressed."}
{"text":"So the service was fast, and food was good, buuuuuuuuuuuuuuut, one of the poached eggs in my Farmhouse Benedict was overcooked. That's my only complaint. Other than that it was fine."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Keith is the best at what he does!!! The waitstaff constantly comes to your table to see if you need refills on your beverages or anything else. Extremely friendly and very efficient."}
{"text":"I've frequented this breakfast/lunch spot more than any since my move back to Arizona.  Initial impressions have stuck as they are rather consistent.  

The staff is friendly and attentive.  I've been served by Kelsey, Nicole, and Paisley that I know of.  They've all been phenomenal.  The establishment is clean, wait times even during their busier times aren't painful (15 minutes or so).  The tables are consistently set and clean.  The bathroom as well, while small in size, is cleanly.  

The menu has a variety, but not an overwhelming amount of options.  That is a good thing.  There's something for everyone, don't get me wrong.  Now as far as your options go you can expect your garden variety breakfast items to choose from.  The coffee is good as is.  I'm a fan of them leaving the pitcher of water and coffee pot at the table.  The food is good, not great, but good.  They have a cinnamon roll here that's the size of a dinner plate.  I love cinnamon rolls, but not the biggest fan of theirs.  It has the taste and consistently of a yeasty dinner roll, with some cinnamon and sugar, slathered in icing.  If that's more your style, by all means try it.  It wasn't bad, just not my favorite.  

All and all, this is a good place to grab a meal and be greeted by a warm and friendly group of folks."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. The staff is always great. Keith's jokes are really funny....what kind of bear won't bite?.....a gummy bear!
My grandmother girlfriends and I eat there at least once a week (sometimes 2x). Love this restaurant!
Plus we can get the bacon as crispy or juicy as we want it!"}
{"text":"God, it was awful!  First, they sat me at a booth right in the sun, surrounded by booths with no such condition.  I moved. 

I ordered the regular breakfast with a side of pancakes and an ice tea: $18.56!  What?  And that's no counting the tip.  Okay...the waitress delayed my breakfast b/c she said the eggs weren't cooked right.  Then, when she did bring it, my over-medium eggs were runnier than French soldiers.  Yuck!  She did get me more, which were cooked okay.  Three tries! The potatoes were undercooked and no longer warm.  The pancakes were good.  The muffins were drive-by buttered.

The service was okay (way better than Hertz).

And they still make you pay at a registers.  What century are we in?"}
