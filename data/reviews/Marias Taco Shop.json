{"text":"This is a hidden gem! I never would have thought to eat here if my boyfriends barber hadn't mentioned it to us. It's very good! Everything made to order so it's fresh! It's a nice family owed restaurant and everyone is very nice! I come here at least once a week to get a taste of good Mexican food! Must try it!"}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the breakfast. We pick up the breakfast burritos once a month or so. The staff is always very nice and they do a quick job of making your order. You can get bacon or ham, but we usually get bacon, ham, and potato, which is a great value for $5. You can barely finish them for a breakfast item. The tortillas are some of the tastiest I have had anywhere. I would highly recommend for breakfast, they are open early. I have not tried any of their lunch items."}
{"text":"We usually eat here at least 3 to 4 times per month which is pretty good considering that we live across town. The food is pretty good. Our 'go to' are the Chicken Flautas...They are amazing! My husband loves their menudo. Reason for taking off a star: The service is not great. The salsa bar is always empty and they close too early on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Great location very convenient! I go to this place a lot and they always do a great job. I have seen them help people in need and ever since then it always makes me want to help support the business."}
{"text":"Worst mexican restaurant food is horrible and the owner has no customer service skill makes you not want to come back"}
{"text":"Had Beef Burrito and Tacos. Food is fresh, fast and very good. Rice, beans and guacamole were great as well. Hidden in the plaza, but well worth finding

Very nice people and the place is IMMACULATELY Clean."}
{"text":"The Flautas at Maria's may be the best in the city.  I'm definitely coming back for more!

Restaurant is small.  Relatively clean.  
Prices seemed about $.50 - $1.00 more than most other places for most items. 
For the Flautas it was worth it, I don't mind paying a smidgen more if the food is great.  

Ill let you guys know how the other menu items are when I try them!"}
{"text":"This was my first place going into this place, the guys I work with recommended it. Didn't take me long to find it, with its bright colored windows advertising $1 tacos and delicious burritos. I walked in and was greeted right away, they had a wide array of meats and freshly made Aqua fresca. I ordered the Cuban sandwich, and was very pleased by the size. I was able to watch the cook prepare it, from toasting the bread on the flat top stove to placing the eggs, cheese and variety of meats on the bread. It was like dinner and a show I guess in this case lunch and a show. When I got to take that first bite it was the most amazing thing ever, I got a perfect blend of everything. I will definitely be going back and will recommend friends try this amazing place out."}
{"text":"Saw they had a better YELP rating than Don Tortaco so I came to check them out. Unfortunately they were closed an hour and half early. Went to Don Tortaco across the street."}
{"text":"Great food!! Very authentic imo. The ladies that work there are always nice and patient. You can't beat the prices and 24hrs???!!! Oh yea!! Since I can't get to tacos Mexico this is my spot! Bonus is that you can see them prepare your food from stArt to finish!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Maria's for years. I'm always pleased by the friendly and helpful attitude of the staff. The food is simple Mexican fare, nothing special, but it is good comfort food. I especially enjoy the carne asade nachos - they'll never make the cover of a foodie magazine, but the nachos never disappoint. Marias stands above their rivals with service and taste."}
{"text":"Maria's is a great place to eat.  The staff is always nice, and the food is great.  The .99 cent beef tacos rock for some cheap food on a lunch break.

The problem would be that the .99 cent tacos are really the only deal there.  As other people have said, this place is more expensive than Robertos/Amigos/any other place for the same quality food.

I will keep going for the lunch deal, and that's about it."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever given only 1 star before, & I admit the enchiladas were decent, but service was -10 stars. 
Asked to have a quesadilla on corn & not flour tortillas because of wheat allergy and to start them first 'cuz he was very hungry but all the food came out at same time - quesadilla in flour & wrong sauce on the enchiladas. When I brought up the problem she said quesadillas were only on flour (couldn't say they would not make it on corn before having us pay for it?) Then when my remade enchiladas were done they just sat on the counter until I happened to look up & the cook pointed to the counter by the cash register/order taker who had no inclination to let me know my food was ready. Later when I asked if there were desserts she just looked at me until I repeated my question & motioned with her head towards the freezer with ice cream bars. Guess words required too much effort. 
So I advise going somewhere else unless the whole rest of the city is out of food."}
{"text":"This place is great, the people work hard, its a small operation, but the food is good and the prices are great.  They always seem to be just busy enough for you to wait a little bit which is a very healthy sign.  The Breakfast burritos are packed with eggs, beacon, cheese, and photos.  I also love their beef tacos, cant be beat for the price and taste."}
{"text":"OMG if I could give this place a half of a star I would! How this place has stayed open for as long as it has, has me puzzled! I've had a lot of Mexican food in my life and if this were the last restaurant serving Mexican food I'd never be back! The food here was disgusting. Yelpers u have lead me astray again"}
{"text":"This is basically the same as Roberto's or several other Mexican food places around.  The food is what you would expect, it's pretty good, not too expensive, and it comes out quick.  Since the food is rushed out so fast, you often get meals where the cheese isn't remotely melted.  Generally they just rely on the heat from the food to melt the cheese.  Staff has been friendly and the place is usually pretty clean.  I give this place 3 stars because it isn't anything special, but still good."}
{"text":"Literally my girlfriend and I eat here at least once a week. Maybe twice!!! Nothing to complain about. Everything is great and the service is even better."}
{"text":"This place was much better when it was Robertos.

It never seems clean anymore.

I'll stop in every now and then since my nail place is close by but won't make an effort to go out of my way.

You can do better."}
{"text":"grossssssss. carne asada fries ($9.15) does not compare to roberto's or fausto's or amigo's tacos! we ordered carne asada fries. it was soggy french fries, the sour cream was clumpy, and it has refried beans and onions in the salsa. me no likey. and in addition, we came late, at like 1am. only 1 table was cleaned off, and the only person that was working their at that time, didn't speak to us AT ALL! she didn't greet us hello. and literally nodded everything. what kinda service is that? anywayyyys, want your carne asada fries fix, go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this taco shop. Everything is relatively inexpensive and it tastes authentic. My go to items are the 99 cent chicken or beef tacos and the green sauce chicken enchiladas. Both options really great! 

Make sure to get an order of guacamole- it's simple and has a great consistency (a nice add on to any item). 

Also, and more importantly, the red sauce at the sauce stand is the best I've had at any taco shop. It's spicy but doesn't have the overpowering chipotle flavor. 

The main reason they lose a star is because even though the tacos are great, there isn't a ton of meat in them!"}
{"text":"Best tacos.

99 cent chicken and beef tacos all the time not just during certain hours. 

They also have the best chilaquiles I have ever had....chicken or chicken and egg. The sauce they use is perfect and it's green not red like most places."}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious and .99.  Can't beat that. Love the cheese and chicken used on the chilaquiles, the sauce and tortillas are satisfactory. Overall, they are friendly and fast with tasty offerings."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Maria's and it was beyond impressive! Excellent selection and a great special on the enchiladas which my companion chose and were beyond excellent, I went with the Chimichanga which was one of the best I've had in a long time, cooked perfectly and the green sauce is fabulous. The place is very clean and the staff is not only friendly but quick too. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Very good food...way better than robertos...1 dollar tacos cant be beat........
I wish they had better hours for they close shop frequently early in the afternoon...Had they been open at dinner time, I could of ordered probably 100 tacos per month around dinner time for friends and family...Its a family place to Id bet 3 o clock is cerveza s time....If they had just a little more help?, but dont let this discourage you for when you order it comes out fast."}
{"text":"Ive enjoyed multiple items here and the service is always great and friendly. I recommend ordering Adobado Nachos with no beans. Reading other reviews about it being over priced, I feel they are not ordering the correct items to get the most out of a meal."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. Pretty small on the inside but clean. Food was good with decent prices. I had a carne asada burrito which was about $6.50 after tax and it was a little above average in taste. The red and green sauces have some kick to them and the carrot/onion/pepper mix is good with your food. 
I'll have to try their $.99 Taco special next time"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Carne Asada fries is $9.16!  Carne asada chips is $8 (about $.50-1.00 more than most places)  The chips are already expensive.  Why does it cost an extra $1.16 to substitute fries?

I had a california burrito.  It didn't have guacamole.  The first rule of carne asada is that it should always have guacamole."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome! Not sure what happened but it has gone downhill food wise.
Microwave to cook meats. Soggy rice and taco shells, kinda tasted like packaged fried rice. I am from Cali where the Mexican food tasted like mexican food. Just like how my Abuela cooked. Not tex mex like Robertos. Well here is hoping things get better or someone opens a shop that actually taste like authentic Mexican food. If you eat somewhere where they toss tons of cheese on a meal it's not real authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by and have a delicious cheese quesadilla or tacos. The quesadilla was huge and the tacos were 99 cents only."}
{"text":"Hands down. Best Flautas I've ever had. Delicious and open late."}
{"text":"Maria's has recently limited their hours to a more normal schedule, which is quite a bummer for me because I tended to go there a little bit later. However, the adobada is still the absolute best meat option at any Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at. And I love Mexican food!! Do yourself a favor next time you're up for Mexican food...
Step 1 - go to Maria's!
Step 2 - order tacos, a burrito, a torta, breakfast burrito, whatever...with adobada!!! I get the #5 combo that's on the wall (two tacos with rice and beans, substitute adobada for the meat).
Step 3 - sit down and prepare yourself for the most delicious meal of your life.
You're welcome."}
{"text":"If your looking for good Mexican food this place has it. We ordered menudo, adobada plate, carne asada tacos, quesadilla, chips cheese and guacamole and even though it wasn't on the menu my wife wanted chips and beans so they were nice enough to make it for her. 
Menudo was awesome. Lots of tripe in it. Flavor was great though a little spicy if you're sensitive to that. 
This is the first time I had adobada so I don't have anything to judge it by but it was very good. I liked it a lot. 
Carne asada taco, chips cheese and guacamole and quesadilla were average and there is nothing wrong with that. 
The chips were either a little over cooked or just cooked in old oil. I liked them but the Mrs. didn't. 
Overall we liked it and will be going back."}
