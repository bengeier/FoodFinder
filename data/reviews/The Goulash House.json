{"text":"All the positive reviews about this place speak for themselves. The chef  rocks! The staff's cool. But:.... you can top this experience at the bar. It's cozy and stylish. It just has the \"ambiance\". (yes, the same menu is available at the bar too) BTW.: Thanks for not having the sport channel on all the time!"}
{"text":"We had eaten here 3 times before but chose to bring our kids this time, one of which is extremely picky. One chose the kids schnitzel and the other the chicken fingers. But we decided to order the Mini Goulash appetizer to let them have a taste. We barely got to taste it since the kids inhaled it it was so good. Their meals were equally enjoyed and the portions ressembled more an adult portion then a kids. The service as always was attentive and quick. So nice to have another family option close by. The kids cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and came here to have Goulash.   Nice neighborhood, great place. Vivian's service was just perfect, friendly suggestions for food menu.  Goulash was test great. Will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"It was Beyond my expectation, I will be going back. I would highly recommend this small independent business before any franchise establishment. Support our community and mom and pop businesses"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great meal here recently. First off the decor is warm and cozy. The service was friendly and fairly timely. We started with the Hungarian Sample Plate. A really nice and filling combo of bread, meats, cheese and veggies. Hearty and delicious. My wife had the Turos Csusza pasta. It was good. A little light on the bacon though. That turned out not to be a big deal, as I had more than enough to share. I ordered the Chef's wooden platter for 1. That is a lie right there. With our appetizer, this could easily have fed us both. It starts with a great big cabbage roll with a side of warm sauerkraut. So warm rich and tasty. Best I've ever had. My wife and I split it. The board they brought my meal out on had a dish each of pickled beets, cucumbers in vinegar and pickled cabbage. Fresh and fantastic. It was also loaded with delicious, perfectly roasted potatoes. On top of the spuds was layered a fantastic schnitzel, a piece of grilled chicken, a piece of grilled beef tenderloin, a half debriziner sausage and finally a thick slice of homestyle bacon. Are you kidding me? One of the few times I've thought that $25 for an entree was a steal. Top that off with a cold Creemore lager and you have on of life's perfect meals. Will definitely be back soon. With friends. Cheers."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh amazing! This is a must eat at place. Great service, great food portions and the flavour was brilliant.   It's a Jem!   Try calling during non-peak dinner times to make reservations, as they are typically unable to answer the phones and provide the great service during dinner rushes.    I'll be back time and again!"}
{"text":"Went here the first time, nice and cute restaurant on Main St. Newmarket.  It was pretty busy as we did not have renovations, waited about 30 min for a table.  However, after the service was very slow.  15 minutes before anyone came to our table to ask about drinks.  Knowing it was very slow service, we put our order in right away.  Food took about 20+ minutes to come, not bad as it was busy.   We got the platter/goulash soup and some other friends got the platter for two as well.  Cabbage rolls were good, could've used a bit more sauce, little dry.  After eating the meal, we had to wait a long time again to get the bill.  No one came to our table to ask about drinks.  Waited over 30minutes with empty plates on our table to get the bill.  We were going to order desserts, but at this point we were fed up with the wait.  I would go here again, but it's a little disconcerting having to wait for so long.  Will try some other places on Main St next time."}
{"text":"We were in the neighbor hood, find this restaurant thru Yelp.    We ordered cabbage roll and chicken schnitzel.    Cabbage roll was good, better than the ones I have by High Park.  Huge portion!     Chicken Schnitzel - I am bias, my hubby made better ones I think - but still good food.    Food:  3/5  Service:  3/5 Quick - not too friendly, he was impatient when I ask about their soup choices, as they only serve Hungarian goulash soup.    OH gotta order Hungarian goulash soup  - very hearty  Atmosphere:  3/5 Quiet, feels like Europe.  There were 2 tables with birthday boy/girls, blasted happy birthday song for the entire restaurant, it was cute.    Score:  60%"}
{"text":"I went here with a date for my birthday after our original plans fell through and it turned out to be an amazing evening.  The schnitzel was phenomenal, tender and seasoned perfectly.  My date had the bratwurst which was also delicious and we split the apple strudel.  Our server was awesome and attentive and the atmosphere was perfect for an intimate dinner for 2. Great little find in the heart of Newmarket!"}
{"text":"If you are craving some goulash, look no more. This place had the best goulash I have had outside Hungary. It is right on main street and a good location to walk around. The service and other food items were great as well."}
{"text":"First of all, I am a true hungarian and cook authentic hungarian food, like my grandmother and mother made it from scratch!  I was excited about a hungarian restaurant opening in Newmarket, was really disappointed when I had dinner there with my adult son shortly after they opened.  We were seated in the window area at the front of the restaurant, the waiter had no clue as to the questions I asked as to the menu, like becsi, which is schnitzel, he knew nothing and after bringing us our soup, part of the main course, we didn't have spoons to eat with, it took forever to get his attention to get cutlery, by that time we lost our appetite waiting so long.  Then the main course of schnitzel arrived with dumplings.  The schnitzel was small, not cooked on high enough heat and the dumplings tasted like paper, there was no egg in the nokedli, altho, the cucumber salad was great, the portions were small, I was really disappointed.  So after spending almost 100 dollars, I can truly say this is not really an authentic hungarian meal and very expensive and poor service.  I mean if you want real authentic hungarian food, with large portions that are truly satisfying to the culture, take an extra 10 minutes and drive to the Rhapsody in Richmond Hill, there you will come out feeling satisfied and well worth your money.  I will not go back to this establishment on Main St., disgrace to my culture which is Hungarian."}
{"text":"Very impressed by the service and food. Our party of three ate an early dinner around 3:00pm and we were seated in the bay window table. We ordered the most popular dishes (according to our waiter) of jäger schnitzel and chicken paprikash, along with  the Turos Csusza. We all agreed the food was very tasty, and quite large portions. I loved every bite of the schnitzel and will probably find myself craving it soon. As previously mentioned in the reviews, the Turos Csusza could've used a bit more substance like more bacon or larger bacon pieces. All in all, a touch on the expensive side for an every day meal, $74 for three people after tax and tip, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Our party of four had a great evening, even though the kitchen set off the fire alarm and two fire trucks arrived to check it out. The alarms work really well! The chicken paprikash was seasoned perfectly. The dessert crepes were flambéed at the table and were not overly sweet. The place was full with patrons waiting at the door by 7 pm on a Saturday night. Perhaps another server or two would be helpful for busy times."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place to go for that special occasion. We had a reservation for a weekday evening but didn't really need one as there was several tables available. Their Szekely Ghoulash is excellent and the world famous Tokaji Dessert wine makes for a perfect ending. Not only was the food excellent but the service was also very friendly and provided for perfect hospitality. A little bright inside as dimming the lights would allow for the table lanterns to be put to better use but the overall experience was amazing."}
{"text":"bit pricey for my taste but the food was great. I had the Beef Goulash and it was suprinsingly good. Meat and dumplings were cooked well and just right."}
{"text":"This place is amazing in its authenticity and overall atmosphere.  Before the Goulash House I had only ever had Hungarian food in Hungary and I loved it! So when I discovered the Goulash House a few years ago I was blown away. The staff is wonderful and I especially love coming here in the winter because its always warm and the combination of the music and scenery on the TV's.... I absolutely love it. Highly recommend. The perogies and the goulash are my fav's."}
{"text":"I went to the Goulash House on Valentine's day with my love and it was a beautiful experience. We sat down and there was a quartet singing acapella! It was very sweet for the occasion and the performers were very talented.  I found it unfortunate that every time someone walked in, there would be a terrible burst off cold air through the front door that couldn't have been avoided by anyone. It made me very chilly during the meal but I could tell that the staff was hyper-aware of it.  I ordered the Chicken Schnitzel and was disappointed when it didn't come with any dipping sauce. It was delicious, but very dry. And it was only served with potatoes. I would have liked it if it came with some vegetables.   The Soup that accompanied our meal didn't arrive first and so we were left with a 40 minute wait between our appetizer and main. They eventually brought the soup, thank goodness my partner and I make for really good conversation.  The Decor and ambiance was really lovely and I recommend this place for locals."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Server spoke 7/10 English which provided for an authentic experience. Reasonable wine prices. FANTASTIC chef platter for $24.99 oh my lord. Great place!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend The Goulash House! I have been 4 times in the last year and each time they've surpassed expectations. Great service, atmosphere and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"We tried this fantastic little gem in the heart of Newmarket recently and found the food to be spectacular, well presented and full of flavor.  Service was also very good and the place definitely has its own special vibe.  Be sure to make reservations, it was a full house on a recent Friday night."}
{"text":"An out of town medical appointment prompted me to head over to charming Main Street where you will find a concentration of great restaurants including the deservingly well regarded Goulash House.  The restaurant itself was bright, airy and very comfortable.  The service was excellent and very personable (waitress and owner were lovely) and the food was delicious and plentiful.  We ordered the chicken crepe and cabbage roll appetizers, and the beef goulash and chicken breast entree with the melted cheese, ham and mushrooms.  Both entrees came with a vegetable soup of the day-comforting and perfectly seasoned.  The beef goulash in particular was outstanding and the chicken crepe a very authentic treat! The homemade apple struedel a la mode (all desserts are homemade) was a very sweet (but not too sweet owing to the granny smith apples) ending.  Just perfect."}
{"text":"Delicious food , great ambience, excellent menu choices. First time there but will return."}
{"text":"Been here couple times and was not overly impress, the price is fine dinning but the food is not. They mess up the orders on both occasions, will not be back."}
{"text":"Really excellent restaurant and I'm glad that they're still serving quality food.  It's a great representation of central European food that has moderated the flavours only slightly to fit a more sensitive palate (i.e. don't worry, nothing is too spicy) but have not compromised on the complexities of their dishes (the paprikash tastes like it should!).  The atmosphere is very cozy and suitable for quite family dining.  I believe they are kid-friendly but the size of the dining room is such that rambunctious toddlers will make few friends among fellow diners so you may want to consider it for an adult's night out."}
{"text":"Great interior, traditional Hungarian food that was really good. Ordered the tasting platter as the appetizer and then the Mini House Platter as my main. Came with Weiner Schnitzel, Cabbage Rolls, Dumplings, Pork Sausage and something else im forgetting. The Hungarian wines were good too and ended up picking up a couple at the LCBO after the meal. Great spot for Newmarket and a couple doors down from Made in Mexico. Both great new restaurants and were packed on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Really loved this place i felt like i was in Hungary the food was delightful especially their chicken schnitzel and their garlic bread, that dish was amazing and the cucumbers with vinegar tasted amazing i have visited many hungarian restaurants and the ones before that i went to were excellent and so was this. I cant really tell you which one i liked better but this was very excellent food and i would definitely  come again. the service was great and it was quiet and had a relaxed ambience loved it and especially that there was a soft sound of euro music which made eating my dinner feel like i was not rushed and that i was able to talk to the people eating dinner with me and not have to yell."}
{"text":"Hold the phone, do you mean to tell me that Main St Newmarket has not only one but TWO unbelievably unique and amazingly delicious ethnic restaurants within steps of one another? Well tickle my chin and feed me something because after visiting The Goulash House recently for some traditional Hungarian cuisine it's settled - Main St Newmarket is most up and coming neighbourhood in the GTA!  I stopped in because I'd heard (and read) great things about this place as an alternative to the already popular Made In Mexico just a few doors down. I will clarify, this is NOT an alternative, this is a spot all on it's own and worth trekking up to Newmarket for, and here is why...  I arrived shortly after lunch on a weekday to an empty restaurant, was seated promptly. After viewing the lunch menu I settled on the Lunch sized goulash, which was brought out in literally mere minutes. It was delicious! Great color, tasty sauce, and piping hot! The shaved German style dumplings were a lovely Compliment to the dish and the beef was tender and juicy! They don't skimp on meat either here - a carnivores dream!  I was feeling totally content with my goulash choice until my server offered me dessert (damn him!) I asked what he recommended and without hesitation he insisted I go for the Crepe Gundel - chocolate and walnut crepe served with rum poured on top and then set en flambe right in front of you. Gasp! Nothing turns my crank more than chocolate, alcohol and fire! EeeeGad!!!  Leaving after dessert, shamefully full, I found a bench to sleep on for a few minutes near by.   This is a sweet spot for food anytime of the year BUT I am gonna be a winter Goulash regular come colder temps, because it made my insides all gooey and warm!!!   Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at the place, so I asked the server to help me out by suggesting some popular options. To be honest I do not think I have gotten the right course, because the pictures on Yelp all look absolutely amazing. The beef I got was very steel and dry. I have no say about the amount of food being served, in fact I think they really do serve in big portions, I am not a heavy eater, so I have to share my meal with one other person, and we still did not manage to finished the entire thing. As of the price, it is a little higher than other dinners on Main Street, three people, two main costed us about $60. It is a place that I would go back for a second time though, just to try out some of their other choices hoping that it really is as good as it is described to be."}
{"text":"Just like grandma's cooking, except I don't get yelled at when I don't finish.  the perogies are wonderful, and the cabbage roll dinner is yummy and filling."}
{"text":"We visited our Ukrainian friends in Newmarket and they invited us to Goulash House. What a nice surprise! I love East European food but never before tried Hungarian cuisine. The food was excellent, the service was friendly and quick even though it was quite busy on Fri night. We had mini-goulash for appetizer, for the main dish I had jager schnitzel and my husband had cabbage rolls. They were well prepared and delicious. We finished with apple strudels - yummy! I will certainly be back to this place - too bad it's in Newmarket..."}
{"text":"I love the Goulash House!  The schnitzel with paprikash sauce is very good.  The new bar area at the back is really cozy.  We showed up tonight just for some delicious dessert and coffee.  We've been many times."}
{"text":"Excellent. Handmade perogies and the weiner schnitzel was perfect. Have been wanting to try this place for a long time and glad I finally did.   It's these little gems in Newmarket that make up for all the bad restaurants around here.   Really good, Hungarian fare. Love it"}
{"text":"Loved it! Food was absolutely delicious and hearty.   You must try the goulash... I SAID MUST! Schnitzel was great too!  Service was pleasant. I will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"When we arrived last night the place was almost empty so the service was quick and efficient.  The meals came out from the back in quick order after out server  brought us  some steaming delicious soup. At our table  was ordered a vegetarian dish 2 pork schnitzels and a mini wooden platter. For the most part everything was enjoyed by all so I will concentrate on the small issues or shortcomings as I see them. For myself that ordered the schnitzel it was perfect, probably the best I ever had, the potatoes let down the meal. The roasted potatoes were not as they should be. Instead of crisp potatoes dusted with a hint of paprika I got boiled potatoes that might have seen the fry pan for 2 minutes so the side was a major letdown. The guest that had the wooden platter was generally pleased with the exception of the smoked bacon that consisted of a 2 inch cylinder of fat and  3 pinches of actual meat. By the time we were finished the restaurant was over half full and our waitress was run off her feet. There was another one there but she served only 2 tables while ours waited on eight or so. Needless to say it was a bit of a wait to get our check. The meal was quite pricey for my standards and I can't say I will be back again at this time."}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie. I get out a lot so I'm always looking for something local and different this hit both. I was blown away. The potion sizes was crazy but good cause I had breakfast for in the morning. if you are not sure about what you want and want it all try the mini platter (nothing mini about this). Try to save room for dessert you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for cabbage rolls and then lo and behold! The Goulash House suddenly appeared out of nowhere on Main Street Newmarket. It's homey, with a bit of the upper crust with its high ceiling and dark decor. The service was fairly fast.   We had the aforementioned cabbage rolls - the dinner came with two along with mashed potatoes and soup. The cabbage rolls were quite meaty and tasty. The soup was really good if a bit salty. Chock full of vegetables, it makes me feel like I'm full of fibre-y goodness just thinking about it."}
{"text":"You don't find many places that serve traditional Hungarian food so I always enjoy this place.   They have a variety of lunch options and it's nice to also get an appetizer and side salad.  I opted for the sausages and sauerkraut on a bun with fries for $12. You can either get it with salad, soup or fries. The waiter also brings you mustard and ketchup on the side.  I really enjoyed my sandwich. The sausage was very taste and flavourful. The fries were soo crispy and had another coating on the outside for extra crispy-ness!   The sandwich was huge and very filling.   The only downside is the fact that service can be slow because they get busy and there's usually only one waiter. But be patient and try this gem in Newmarket!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was almost empty on Saturday noon and the food was not very fresh. Our food got ready in less than 15 minutes. I feel that they warmed the pre cooked food. I did not like the taste of food."}
{"text":"Disclaimer - first time eating Hungarian food, but if this is what it tastes like, call me a fan.   Came here for lunch with coworkers on a Friday afternoon, around 12 pm. It is located at a corner spot along Main St Newmarket, with plenty of parking on either side of the street behind the first row of buildings. There was only one group when we arrived and a couple more trickled in as we ate, but there was not a problem with seating. The server was very nice and made an effort to explain the menu after I had asked for some recommendations. Taking his recommendations, we (3) each ordered a langos (fried potato bread), with a beef goulash (stew) on the side. When the langos arrived first, I thought there was no way I could have the goulash on top of that. The portion was surprisingly big, and tasted very good (and filling!) with the outside being crunchy and mixed with tomato, lettuce and pork schnitzel. The goulash was the highlight for me - it was definitely not short of toppings and was very hearty. The beef was tender and was nice and warm when served. Regretted not eating more of the goulash in between my langos but that's my own fault!   Service is good, and the lunch specials are quite reasonable in price. Will be back after exploring the other options in the area as well!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night.  Heard great reviews about this place from locals. Green P Parking right behind the restaurant.  Restaurant is cozy; decor is very European.  Since it was our first time having Hungarian food, asked the server for recommendations.  Ordered a Mini Goulash and a Wooden Platter for 1 (comes with: Cabbage Roll Appetizer, Grilled Pork and Beef Tenderloin, Wiener Snitzel, Debreziner Sausage, Crispy Smoked bacon, 3 kinds of small tangy salads, house potatotes).   Very generous portions, very flavourful, very filling.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Great Ambiance and service... the Goulash soup, and the beef stroganof was amazing.. The crepe apricot very delicious.. Overall, a great experience but you need to get a reservation, especially on weekend nights"}
{"text":"Another absolute gem in the heart of Main St. Newmarket. This is absolutely the most ideal place to eat in the winter month's. A warm bowl of goulash really does the trick.  I had the Szekely goulash which is with beef and sauerkraut. Wow was I impressed. Very vibrant flavor and extremely hearty. The portion size here was fantastic and the price is more than reasonable for the quantity of food.  Interior is a little drab and the service was average. But I always place the importance on the food and the flavor. This place won't let you down where it counts.  This isn't a place I could eat all the time, but it sure is wonderful every once and a while. Like I said before, you can't beat this place to warm you up on a cold winter's night and leave you satisfied.  I also had the apple strudel which had good flavor but was a tad dry for my taste. Definitely get your with ice cream to help it out in the texture and consistency department.  This is a MUST EAT for anyone in the Newmarket area."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic Hungarian cuisine. The titular goulash is amazing--they really nail the dumplings. The Chicken Paprikash is another standout. Perogies are amazing, as is the Smoked Mozzarella Garlic Bread. Desserts are great. Good service and prices, reasonably fast.  Only downside is the awful location--it's a beautiful part of down but terrible traffic and virtually no parking. The adjacent lot is almost always full as are all of the street parking spaces; even the massive lot on the opposite side of Main (a good walk) is sometimes full, and if not you have to park way on the far corner and walk quite a long way. Can't imagine any way for them to fix that, it's just an unfortunate reality. It's bad at all times of all days of the week, lunch and dinner, weekday and weekend. Don't let it dissuade you from visiting, just pack your patience and good walking shoes."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how nice it was inside compared to the outside of the building. The waitress was very knowledgable and friendly as we had never tried this type of food before. The food was amazing, a little pricey but the portions were large."}
{"text":"Fantastic and authentic Hungarian restaurant. My daughter and I had the Wooden Platter for two and it came with pork snitzel, sausage, steak, roast potatoes, smoked bacon, cabbage rolls and 3 side tangy salads. The cabbage roll appetizers were amazing! Highly recommend this place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"It took us a long time to finally try this restaurant but I'm so glad we did. My regret is that we've missed out on this goodness for almost 7 years.  I have had the wooden platter for 1 so as to try a little bit of everything. The portions are so generous that I am always happy to have leftovers for lunch the next day (if hubby doesn't find it late in the night and devour it, lol). I especially love the garlic bread with smoked mozzarella. We also tried the strudel but I really love the crepe Gundel. Service is always excellent and friendly and helpful. It is packed during the dinner hour but empties around 8-9 p.m. I am planning to return soon to actually try the goulash or the stroganoff.  I also want to try their Unika Lounge at the side of the building."}
{"text":"Mouthwatering Authentic Goulash Yummy Accommodating Relaxed  Good and pleasant environment and service, all done with pride."}
{"text":"Delicious food. We went on a weekday for lunch but chose beef goulash from the main menu. Totally delicious, huge portions. The service was good, waiter friendly. One of our party spilled something on her shirt and the waiter brought a damp cloth and napkins. There seemed to be a lot of regulars. Great atmosphere. I recommend it. Huge public parking lot across the street."}
{"text":"So I arrived at the restaurant about 15 minutes before my reservation and I figured I would enjoy a beer before my company arrived.   When I entered the building there was no one around and another older couple came in just behind me. we waited for about 10 minutes before someone finally appeared out of the back they then took each of us to our seats at the windows. The waiter approached the older couples table first and ask them where they heard about the restaurant and they responded they heard it from a friend and that it better be good they ordered a bottle of wine and then the server left to go get their bottle when he returned with their glasses and a bottle of wine.  I would have assumed that he would have asked me if I needed a drink but that never happened no one approached me at all until about 10 minutes later when my guest arrived and about 5 minutes after that finally the server came and asked us if we wanted drinks and also if we knew what we wanted to order. My guest already had checked the menu online and knew what she wanted it looks good on the menu so I ordered the same thing I believe it was called the mini house platter which consisted of one slice of bacon one half of a sausage that's all two types of cabbage and we switched the potatoes to the spetzle. We also ordered a side of the papprikash sauce for the spetzle.  I had my hopes up because I heard a few good things about the restaurant but honestly I was quite underwhelmed with the food, the taste was ok but nothing special the one slice of bacon seemed like it has been cooked much earlier in the day and just heated up, it was extremely dry and the sauce that we got for our spaetzle wasn't very flavorful   Its a nice restaurant especially the seats in the front by appearance, but honestly after the extremely slow service I can't say that I'll be going back the food wasn't good enough to make up for the mistakes of service.  Oh well you win some you lose some."}
{"text":"A truckload of Eurofood on every plate!  I have been wanting to try the Goulash House for a long time, when a business associate suggested it for a lunch meeting.  I knew that the portions would be large, but wow!  I had the Mini House Platter so I could have a representative sampling of the cuisine.  Plus, I could not decide what to have from the massive menu, hence the default platter approach.  My well stacked plate arrived very hot and fresh.  On the bottom was a big fat cabbage roll, stuffed with rice, meat and garlic.  Lots of garlic!  Layered on top was a mound of sauerkraut, a debreziner sausage, and some golden roasted baby potatoes.  Also, there was some \"crispy smoked bacon\" as it is listed on the menu, but lets be clear--these were massive chunks of lardon, or pork belly!  Finally for the quilt on top, there was a schnitzel the size of a small frisbee.  Needless to say, a serious professional eater like me could not finish the meal without serious pain.  It was all extremely good, and full of flavour.  I always worry about European food, as I often encounter rather bland flavours, but not here.  So big a menu, so little time..."}
{"text":"Blech!!!  No idea how this place is getting so many winning reviews. We waited 45 minutes for our table despite having a reservation. They let two other couple go ahead of us who were walk-ins. Service is slooow. We are never in a hurry when we eat out, but the whole experience took over three hours from the time we arrived to the time we got our bill.  The soup starter is tasty...the only thing that was. The cabbage roll was inedible. Freezing cold and grossly over-seasoned. The couple next to us also couldn't get through theirs and sent theirs back. We didn't say anything but agreed it was gross. The beef stroganoff was very overpowered by too much mustard in the sauce. After years of enjoying great Hungarian food at a couple spots in Toronto, the food here was a shock.  Is it possible we caught them on a terrible day? Won't be spending time or money trying again."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentines day (lunch)... Unless you're a big eater, their \"platter for one\" is actually enough for 2 people!  The waitress was really nice - she actually made recommendations when we asked for them and checked on us frequently.  Overall, it is a clean, cozy place that's a good stop for trying something new!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner, friendly staff great prices. Came here tonight for the first time. We tried the wood platter for 2. It can feed 4 people, a great sampling of different meat options served at the restaurant with potatoes, pickles and beats and cabbage.  The platter comes with cabbage rolls as an appetiser, to be honest I wasn't a huge fan. I prefer my cabbage rolls with tomato sauce but these don't have any sauce. It's just a different kind of cabbage roll, good just not my cup of tea.   I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit, really want to try the pork hock.   Very intimate restaurant, be sure to make reservations they fill up very quickly.  No parking, but there is public parking across the road behind the buildings. Short 2 minute walk away.   When I get a craving for Hungarian/German food I found my place!"}
{"text":"Has a meal at the Goulash House this Sunday. The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere and everyone was very friendly and professional.  The food was excellent, very authentic with very generous portions.  The sampler deli plate was a very nice starter.  Overall I was very impressed, definitely exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"I lived in Russia for a couple years in the past, so I had the opportunity of tasting many eastern european dishes while I was there. I can safely say that the ones I tasted at The Goulash House are as good as the real deal.  I had the soup of the day with a plate of Chicken Schnitzel and that was made to perfection. I would serve it with mashed potatoes instead of roasted potatoes but that's just personal taste. Everything was well seasoned, well cooked and portions are quite big. I also ordered an Apple Strudel, which was quite good as well. Not outstanding as the food, but good enough.  Service was bad at the beginning (they took about 5 minutes to sit me, my husband and a couple of friends), but considering it was a busy late Saturday dinner, I'd say it is fine. We were the last ones to leave the restaurant and we didn't feel rushed. I would definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant. The place has a nice ambience, servers are very friendly and attentive and most importantly the food is delicious.  My partner and I really enjoyed our meals. I had a very fresh garden salad to start followed by  the Chicken Overi. Both used fresh ingredients and properly prepared to excellence.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Best pork schnitzel in Newmarket. I happened upon this place as Newmarket-has a number of places to eat at in the old downtown area.  Should book ahead as it can be busy at times. Lots of options on the menu and the beer selection is good."}
{"text":"This place deserves the hype! I'm not an expert on Hungarian food so I can't vouch for its authenticity, but I can vouch for its deliciousness. Being new to Hungarian cuisine, I went with the \"chef's special\" and got the Wooden Platter for 1 - basically a whole bunch of meat with cabbage rolls for an appetizer. The cabbage rolls were an experience (not sure I loved them, but glad I tried them) but what I can't get past is the pork tenderloin. (Maybe it's because I'm from Indiana.) The breading was light and perfect and the whole thing seemed to melt in my mouth. Not to take away from the other great food, but the tenderloin was the highlight for me. Somehow I managed to squeeze in the apple strudel a la mode as well -- the ice cream fits in the cracks, right? -- which was wonderful as well. Service was okay, I could tell they were training a new waitress on my visit so I was passed over quite a few times even though the place wasn't exactly busy. But I came in during the pre-dinner rush so I'll let it slide. Definitely recommended if you're in the area and up for something a little different!"}
{"text":"Everything about this Hungarian restaurant was awesome.  The waitress was really knowledgeable in telling us what to eat and she was really nice to talk to. Made the dining experience fun and memorable.  Food was delicious. We ordered the platter for one and a mini goulash soup for lunch. There was so much food and we were super stuffed.  The goulash soup was very flavourful, not too salty, and the beef was soft and tender. A+   The cabbage roll with sauerkraut was nice and light. I don't usually like sour foods, but this had just the right amount of sour. Really good! A  The bacon and Schnitzel was amazing! The beef was nice and tender. The pork wasn't bad. The platter was an A.  My fave was the goulash soup, bacon and schnitzel!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Goulash house a few times now. So I think its safe to say I would give them a 3.5 overall.  Don't bother calling them for reservations since they will never pick up the phone. After trying numerous times to make a reservation, we just decided to try our luck. I have seen them turn people away towards 9pm even though they close at 10pm. So we came earlier to improve our chances of getting in. We were standing at the door for about 5 mins to get seated. I was positive the waiters saw us but none of them approached us. After a few minutes they said we would have to wait for their manager. So we waited and I had half a mind to leave and go next door to hungry brew hops or the bucket co.  Thankfully we got seated in the next couple of minutes and the experience improved quite a bit from there since the food was fantastic! Although I don't know if it is really authentic but I sure can say they serve some delicious fare here. Their portion sizes for the mains are huge. My dinner entree was good for lunch the next day. I had the jager schnitzel. It was wonderful with a creamy mushroom sauce on top. I also got a bite of the beef goulash and chicken schnitzel which my friends had ordered. Everything was perfect. If you like your schnitzel crunchy order the ones without sauce as it makes them a bit soggy.  The ambiance was nice both for a date and a family dinner. 4.5 stars for the food and ambiance but I do have to take one star off for the service. After all it is as important as a good meal!"}
{"text":"We were looking for new places to eat around Newmarket and thought we'd try out some authentic Hungarian food. We made reservations for 4 for and they had a table ready for us. There is free parking around the area.  Portions were really big. We struggled finishing the platter for a bit. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I love the Goulash house...don't know if it's because of the old school Eastern European decor or I was craving for a good hearty goulash.  But this restaurant is such a little gem in the hood-and for good reasons.  Service is attentive.  Food portions are very good size.  Everything taste fresh and delicious.  Even for the deep fried items, they seem to keep the food quality in good control.  The amount of seasoning for the goulash soup is just right, and I'm very satisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"This is a great Hungarian restaurant with great service. It gets busy on weekends as they have live music sometimes, so make sure you make reservations ahead of time. The restaurant is quite small and the atmosphere is very \"homey.\" They have a video on a screen near the front of the restaurant that shows various parts of Hungary and other Eastern European decor around the restaurant.  Both times I came, I ordered the giant platter (for two, to share with my partner) that included a bit of everything, including cabbage roll, steak, bacon, sausage, pickled vegetables, potatoes, and schnitzel. Very very filling for one person, so if you're not a big eater, get the smaller version of it!  The staff are very good at explaining their dishes and the dishes seem to be homemade and authentic. The people I went with were Hungarian and this restaurant got the stamp of approval from them as well!"}
{"text":"Visited on a quiet Tuesday night.  We loved it so much that we returned with friends 30 minutes after we left to catch the dessert.  The food is amazing, flavorful and my husband and I were able to share a beef goulash between the two of us.  This is the real thing for the most part and very filling.  Our server was able to recommend a good wine to accompany the meal.    The location is cozy and the ambiance reminded us of our days in Europe.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My very first time trying out Hungarian food. Very nice place and service is great. A good place for family and friends to have dinner together.  Serving size is really huge which the host honestly informed us. For a group of 6 adults and 4 kids we ordered the Platter 2, 2 chicken snitzel and the beef goulash. The platter comes with cabbage roll, pork snitzel, bacon, beef, pork, 3 salad and soup. We enjoyed this dish very much. I love the bacon!"}
{"text":"Where do I start with this one?  Service is perfect. Food is amazingness. Parking isn't a hassle (non-newmarketeers may have issues...sorry!) The young male server isn't hard on the eyes.   I've had their schnitzel, perogies, warm cabbage salad, and the robbers plate.   The schnitzel is huge! My uncle and I love going traditional with the sunny side up egg atop the meat and jager sauce on the side with lemon. If you ask nicely, sometimes they accommodate you with the egg; sometimes they cannot. Schnitzel is crispy and never saugy. The warm cabbage salad is where it's at!  The perogies are pretty sweet, too. My only suggestion would be to ask for the sour cream on the side as it kind of mutes the flavours and makes things a touch saugy.   If you're on the fence, I say just do it. And if you're having a miserable time for some odd reason, take a shot of their house plum schnapps. That will put you in a better mood."}
{"text":"My family is Hungarian, so I'm picky about restaurants...but this place is the real thing.  You won't find better in downtown Budapest.  Everything is good and we've tried a good chunk of the menu over our visits.  The Jokai Bean Soup is a must try and the chicken crepe app is heavenly.  The signature beef goulash could feed a family on its own and the beef is so tender it barely stays together.  The cabbage rolls are fantastic and unique...they taste almost like they pickle the cabbage for the wraps.  Adds a nice vinegar bite to cut the richness.  Make a reservation ....they're always busy!  Service deserves a mention too..family run and it shows!  Friendly and welcoming...just try it already!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and ambience. Everything's amazing but they're called the goulash house for a reason! GET THE GOULASH! Giant portions though. I don't mind because I have have a good appetite, but my mother was struggling to finish everything."}
{"text":"A great place in the north - really authentic and well done. Warms the soul on a cold day.  Gundel for dessert is pretty much a must. Save room, though it is hard to do with their portions."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch! The options were traditional Hungarian with some other European options. Really cute decor and good service!"}
{"text":"Thank you yelp for recommending me this place! Came here for dinner with my coworker on a Friday. It was already busy at 6:30 so I'm glad we made reservations.   As a first timer here, the waitress was very sweet. She took the time to explain the menu and made recommendations. She came to check up on us a few times and refilled our water.   After a difficult decision of wanting to try everything, I've decided to get the beef goulash, their signature dish.   For starter, we got the smoked salmon with capers. It was delicious with the perfect pairing of capers. It's however a bit too salty for me.  At first I thought it was a bit small compared to my coworkers dish. However it's really filling because of the amount of beef in the stew. It was rich, hearty, and warming - perfect for a cold day!  For dessert, we got the flaming crepe. The highlight is the walnuts soaked in rum. It is very subtle but brings out the flavour of the nuts and chocolate. Before serving the crepe, they lit the whole crepe on fire which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I have been to this place more than once and we have definitely travelled the menu. I am never disappointed. The atmosphere is great and you never feel rushed.  My only comment to the restaurant owner is about customer service. The last two times I have been. I have had the same waitress. A young blond woman. She's amazing. We love her personality and service. What a great staff. However last night what I saw was so frustrating!!!!!!  It took forever to get some things to our table because she was positively run off her feet. From what I saw the owner and another waiter were very minimally involved in fact he looked like he was covering only three tables and she had the rest.  If the owner is just strolling around it would be great to refill coffee and water glasses and clear plates so our waitress can do her job.  I also saw the waiter come out of the kitchen holding our plates and simply stand there!!!! He should've brought them over as she was taking an order and simultaneously helping a customer pay their bill.  More team work would have made last night absolutely perfect"}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious Hungarian food on heritage street in new market!  A bite of the beef goulash bought me back to Budapest.    Our group of 6 ordered the perogies, beef stroganoff, beef goulash, chicken schnitzel and cabbage roll dinner.  The star of the meal for me was the super moist Perogies with just the right amount of fillings.  The beef goulash and stroganoff were close seconds. The stewed beef was tender and flavourful served on top of home made dumplings (similar to a gnocchi). I didn't get to try the chicken schnitzel as it was all gone before I can dig my folks in it but everyone that had a piece said it was delicious.   I really don't think you can go wrong with any of items on the menu. You can literally throw a dart at the menu and end up having a great meal. The prices are inexpensive with big portions. We were all stuffed with takes out. Oh and did I mention it's located on the charming main st of new market?"}
{"text":"The schnitzels are fine, but the desserts left more to be desired. Especially the moist cake with whip cream and a cherry on top--the menu said it came with walnuts and we found ZERO walnuts in it and 50% whip cream and not much of a cake.  Because most of their menu requires frying, it takes them a long time to prepare the food, so expect a 30 minute wait after ordering."}
{"text":"I loved it when I came here. Originally we wanted to go to Made in Mexico, which was down the street and completely full, but I'm so happy we came here instead. The schnitzel was really good, I'd definitely come back again with my parents next time. Would recommend if you're looking for something to eat that isn't Italian, Mexican, or Sushi around New Market/Aurora."}
{"text":"First time checking this place out.  Experience was good, glad we tried it but will not be back.  The good was ok but greasy.  The sausage was not good however good value.  I had the perogies with beef goulash soup.  Soup was oily as greasy film could be seen and tasted."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great, location is great. Will definitely be back!  Located on main Street newmarket. Right where all the action is.  On street parking and green P parking behind the building and a huge lot behind the buildings across the street.  It's pretty. They have big windows and if you sit in them you can see all the action happening on Main Street.  We came at lunch. There's a lunch menu. Prices run from 8-13 not too bad. Portions were pretty good for lunch sized.  I had the lacso. It's soft green peppers in a red sauce with dumplings. I'm not sure why I got it, but I'm glad I did. It was delicious. I'd get it again. Everyone liked their food. The goulash looked and smelled amaZING. The person who got it liked it a lot so I think it's another item to try!  Service was great. Our server was attentive, made sure we had everything we needed and made great food recommendations.  I'll definitely be back!"}
