{"text":"We have frequented this restaurant for several years, we have tried other Chinese restaurants in the area but none compare. It is largely a takeout restaurant and the service is always attentive and friendly. The salt and pepper seafood is excellent; crisp, perfectly spiced and very more-ish! 
The ginger beef is crispy and you can taste the ginger. The basics are all really good. The stir- fry veggies are crisp, the sweet and sour tasty and the wor wonton is excellent. The great thing is the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Pretty awful. Worst eggrolls I've ever tasted, and lets be honest...there's a LOT of bad Chinese food out there! The rest is starchy, gelatinous and just gross. They're close, but not worth it."}
{"text":"We usually frequent another chinese restaraunts in our area, but after receiving a flyer in the mail with a coupon we decided to try Oakridge Phoenix....horrible idea.

We ordered spring rolls and pork gyozas/dumpling.  Both were very fried to a dark brown making them quite dry.  The dumpling filling was an odd flavor unlike any I've had before.  The spring roll was hideously sweet, from what I don't know.  Neither had a fresh vegetable taste, they were more like they had been mixed with the meat ages ago and became muddy.  

We ordered Pork Egg Foo Young  which was literally just egg, carrots, peas and sprouts.  Though the veggies were at least fresh the whole thing was devoid of any seasoning or flavor.  Also most places serve it with some kind of sauce, there was none.  Just a huge hunk of egg and veggies, that's it.  

We also ordered almond soo gai.  Again this was fried within a shade of being black.  The chicken inside was so dry it was not edible.  I would guess they were frozen for far too long and acquired freezer burn.  

Finally the coupon was for a free order of Chicken fried  rice.  It was literally rice and chicken with a few peas sprinkled on top.  Again no flavor, no seasoning and the chicken was dry as dry can be.  The rice was oddly plump and hard.  

Needless to say we will not try this place again.  Clearly they are cutting corners by over freezing food that doesn't get rotated frequently enough.  And I've never had such bland or oddly flavored food, especially chinese food."}
