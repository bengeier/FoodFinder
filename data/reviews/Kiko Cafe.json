{"text":"Service is the culprit, it's worse than average Chinese restaurant.  All the waitresses have attitude issues.  Food quality has slightly slipped but still ok."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday and braced for a subpar experience due to the bad reviews but I was pleasantly surprised!   We ordered:  - Chicken curry with rice: The curry was creamy and the flavour was all there with the perfect amount of spiciness. Aside from chicken, the curry was filled with squash, carrots, mushrooms and onions. Small surcharge if you want roti instead of rice.  - Baked fish on rice with tom yum sauce: We ordered this because we were curious about the use of tom yum sauce in an unconventional way and it was actually not bad. Tastes just as you would expect - tom yum in a creamy consistency.  - Milk tea: Came with both entrees, was not bad.  The restaurant is small so you'll have to wait during busy hours. Service was quick but curt, not unexpected from this kind of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times for lunch.  The food is decent. Service is kind of in your face. What I can't tolerate is the acoustics of this place!  The sound bounces around...arrrr!   Too loud during lunch time when it's busy!   Need to get out!  3 stars for food but 2 stars for service and venue (acoustics)."}
{"text":"Quick spoiler: above average HK cafe  Order & atmosphere: modern style quick eatery decor. Small wooden tables with no booths. Actual cafe is relatively small, this seems to help maintain a higher quality food product. Rest of my group complimented the utensils as cute.  Food & service: fast service typical of hk cafes. They have enough staff to ensure clients get served and food gets out quick (you won't find smiles though lol). My wife got the bolognese pasta which was flavorful, cheesy and meaty. My friend got a steak which was way too raw but they gladly rezapped it. I ordered a free range pork chop. My order took the longest but it got the highest praise from the table. Seasoned just right and juicy with simple vegetables and a small order if fries. Portions are average size for all dishes.   For dessert we got the French toast cubes which were perfect fit sharing. Small yummy bites that came drizzled with sweet evaporated milk rather than the traditional sweet/honey syrup.   Deserving of 3.5 but due to the Yelp rating system, it gets the 4 stars. I would recommend and would come back for more."}
{"text":"Can't figure out why such a low rating for this place. I came here for lunch with my family on a Saturday and had a fairly good experience.  The place is small, about 15 tables, so expect to wait a bit before being seated. As with many HK cafes, there are usually shortage of servers, so we weren't greeted right away. And because of that, some lady behind me walked up and just ask to be seated and totally ignore me who was standing near the front. I hate people with no manners..  Let's talk about the food. I ordered the special roasted chicken on veggie rice, and my husband had the curry lamb. I would say the dishes are above average. The chicken was tender, juicy with plenty of veggie rice underneath. My husband's curry was done right, slightly on the sweeter side but was yummy. My kids had a spaghetti with cheese sauce and they seemed to love it.    I thought prices were fair. A $8.95 meal usually include a soup and a hot drink. Service can be better, but the staff was friendly and were generally attentive to our needs. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, was really good the first time. Ordered a laksa with chicken and fish, Tom yum gong chicken spaghetti, and baked pork chop rice. Second time ordered a Tom yum gong soup noodle wasn't that great was just spicy without much taste. And most recent time I ordered the laksa again, was very horrible I took a few taste and didn't even finish it. It was water down and taste less. I think this place is not bad but just that the consistency is very good."}
{"text":"A Hong Kong style Cafe (\"cha chan tang\") with a few more dishes inspired by other Asian cuisines. As recommended by other Yelpers, I tried their laksa (I chose the one with beef), a corned beef and egg sandwich, and their French toast cubes.  Laksa with beef - 3.5/5 Obviously you can't expect an authentic laksa dish, but it is a fairly tasty curry noodle soup. It was a bit strange how they mixed vermicelli and another kind of thick noodle. The curry soup was flavourful and I found it to have a bit of a spicy kick but still fairly mild. It also came with a few fried tofu puffs. Overall, a satisfying dish if you're craving a more flavourful soup noodle.  Corned beef and egg sandwich - 4/5 This is a pretty standard menu item at a cha Chan tang and they did a good job, but there's nothing outstanding about it. There was a good amount of egg and corned beef.  French toast cubes - 3/5 I was less impressed by this dish than other Yelpers. While it's a nice shareable dish, I thought there could have been a bit more condensed milk. I also like peanut butter in my Chinese style French, which these don't have.   I also had their cold milk tea, which again was pretty standard, although I thought there was a bit too much ice. 4/5"}
{"text":"Food was good.   Laska with chicken and fish cake: it was good with right amount of spiciness; I was able to drink their soup.  But for the portion, it was the right amount for a lady but too small for a teen   I paid an extra $1 for their premium coffee, nothing special; saved $ and get their regular.  I will go back and try other items. Service was not bad actually compared to other HK style cafes."}
{"text":"Overall, poor service with mediocre to bad food and candidate for The Saddest Laksa In The World.  Ordered a laksa with shrimp and chicken. Incredibly bland and undersalted broth and toppings. This is basically laksa for people watching their cholesterol and blood pressure or those with sensitive stomachs as it had no coconut milk, salt, or spices. Fairly certain it's just their basic, watery chicken noodle broth with some chili oil and fried shallots. Hilariously, they put two thumbs up next to it on their menu as a recommended item. Singaporean hawkers would probably politely ask the owners not to call their dish laksa as it has little resemblance to authentic laksa.  Got a taste of the curry beef brisket. Acceptable portion size and the beef tendon was tender and the sauce was decent. Another DC (who ordinarily eats fairly bland food) ordered the pork cutlet noodle soup and said the broth was absolutely flavourless and needed some soy sauce.  Dishes: when I drank my hot water from the plastic cup, I detected a faint bleach smell from the cup. I believe this is another Chinese restaurant which bleaches plastic utensils/dishes.  Service: when I raised my concern about the laksa having no flavour and pointed to my 80% full bowl of laksa, the waiter just said, \"People have been ordering it a lot.\" I'm used to brusque service from Chinese waitstaff (have eaten in HK and China), but this response was illogical.  Based on the food and the service, I wouldn't return. I would rather get my HK diner food from more reliable restaurants like New City or Phoenix."}
{"text":"My friend has heard about the french toast cubes from this place for a while now and it definitely did not disappoint!! It was served warm and just crunchy enough, with syrup drizzled on it and butter on the side. Definitely a must! My friend and I also ordered the roti and vegetable curry, it's a good snack. The savory flavor is a good compliment to the french toast. I like to eat savory and sweet for balance lol. The roti was the right amount of crunchy on the outside and airy on the inside, served with just enough of the curry for dipping. Definitely would go back"}
{"text":"This restaurant has terrible service.  The waitresses are extremely unhappy and rude. When we got our table, we had to wait to get our menu. Food is not very tastey either. Then, when the bill came, I didn't finish my food and had asked for a takeout box. The waitress said very rudely that I had to pay 25cents for a takeout box. I have never once had to pay for a takeout box in my entire life of eating in restaurants. This restaurant is extremely cheap. I will not be coming to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"At first glance this appears as any regular HK style cafes. The majority of the menu does include the usual stuff. However, the chef's menu is what adds an extra sparkle to the standard everyday pork chop noodles.   Someone in our party had been to here before and recommended the chef's special (first page). To be fair, I may never have tried it unless it was recommended (since the specials are a bit pricier). I'm glad I did, because it's well worth it!   Our party had a chance to try the sea bass, the steak, the cow cheeks (!!). The portions are pretty generous, and we are told the soups and sides may change daily as the chef sees fit. This is especially impressive because the soup of the day was much better than what is usually served at HK style cafes (usual borsch or cream soup).    For dessert, we had a chance to try their cubed French toast and soufflé, both of which were really good. The cubed French toast is especially crispy, and the soufflé was incredibly fluffy in texture.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"?? cafe cute little cafe inside Michael Angelo plaza.   They have a variety of specialty Hong Kong style cafe items and more.  They had newspaper coupon offers for free ????? (which is so crispy)? ????? (mouth watering) which if it is free you CANNOT take away if you don't finish it (it's in the fine prints). If you bring in a coupon make sure you read the fine prints because some are weekday lunches only etc. Lots of specialty drinks and good items which you must try.   Their ??????? chicken rice is pretty good. Rice is always hot and the chicken is always juicy, crispy and steamy. A lot of their recommended items are good to try.  Clean bright interior design. Service sometimes lacks quality but food comes at a decent time and temperature.   Their bathroom is a single stall at the back. Check out the pictures uploaded.   Oh they have liquor license and a patio but I haven't seem them use the patio before."}
{"text":"I used to eat there at least once or twice a week since they opened.  Always have their famous dishes such as Salty chicken on the rice, Berkshire pork chop or beef cheek on their special board,  beef tongue in black pepper sauce, cube toast...etc.  And I think they are the best or one of the best in GTA for Hong Kong Style restaurant.  However, few months ago these dishes taste are totally different in a bad way.  I decide to give them another chances for benefit of doubt.  I believe that there might be a settle period for them if the chef was changed.   Last week, went there again and cross my fingers.  OMG not only the food quality and quantity are getting worst,  their services turning from Hong Kong style to mainland China style too.  So disappointed to a restaurant used to be one of the best..........SIGH !!!!!  I think I will wait to see some 5 stars reviews before my return or never ever !!!"}
{"text":"Performance is definitely going downhill.  I've been ordering together with my husband and he got his order within 10 mins, then my order came and one of the waitress just delivered to another table who came much later than me...   Their famous French toast cubes are going downhill as well, way too oily which you can taste the bread soaked with oil and turn into a greasy gummy paste... Very disappointing...."}
{"text":"Passed by Kiko a few times and finally had a chance to visit them.  They are a decent HK diner.  Had the Chicken steak with pasta.  The combo came with soup an a drink as well.  The place was packed when we went and had to stand in line.  They didn't take down anyone name or gave out number so it was pretty hectic.  I will be back next time to try the fresh toast cubes as I heard good things about that."}
{"text":"I was having late dinner here with a friend.  I first wanted to go somewhere else, but it was kind of late so this was one of very few options.  Well, I was served actually more than 10 minutes after I sat down for the menu.  There were two servers, so I felt a little annoyed.  Since my friend was late, it was okay.  The food came quite fast after we ordered.  I guess that's because they are clsoing soon.   I ordered the teriyaki chicken which was quite good, and the portion was just right.  It came with a cream of corn soup and a drink also.  Overall, a so so experience.  Since the flavour was good, I might come back if I am having late dinner again.  lol!  Need to hit the gym today to burn off some calories."}
{"text":"Came here today, came here plenty of times last year.   It seems different from before, waitresses here are not very friendly or bright.  Food has raised in price, quality lowered and quantity.     Today I came here here for some afternoon tea specials. I ordered tom yum fish cake vermecelli which was around $4.50 for 4 thin slices of fish cake that are over cooked to the point it doesn't even have a chew to it.... ( wtf.. )   Then I also ordered deep fried fish cutlet w/potato salad for $5.65 ... Instead of ordering the potato salad I asked to switch to fries thinking it was $1 extra.. But that's not the case they charged me $1.50 extra for such a small amount of fries that are  broken in half to make it seem like there's a large amount. (That is ridiculous and dissapointing.. ) for afternoon tea.. There are many other Chinese restaurants that serve afternoon tea  that don't even charge to switch..   Also ordered French toast which was decent.. But unfortunately filled with sooo much oil..  that one single bite is like eating a mouthfull of oil..    Sigh... service is also bad ( waitresses were not attentive and seem to have no knowledge of their menu also not to mention they have rude attitude).   Food is going down hill and for the price you are better going else where for afternoon tea."}
{"text":"Terrible service and subpar food at best. I wouldn't return. The salad..... Is the worst haha. A joke, few pieces of lettuce with some drips of thousand island sauce....  Why would you pay even average price for very below average food and service...   Will not repeat."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Somehow this little cafe has eluded me. I had seen it multiple times, tried going a couple times, but never made it in. A nice little Hong Kong style cafe with a variety of choices, but has the usual dishes you would expect.  Very brightly lit as the cafe has many windows, which makes the ambiance quite refreshing on a sunny day. Natural light is always the best in my opinion. Quick service with friendly servers overall. Menu is quite extensive, but each section comes with fine print regarding what comes with each meal you choose. A bit confusing as all the fine print seems quite similar, but there are slight differences. Some come with soup while others don't. Some come with beverages, while some only during specific hours. Honestly makes things way too confusing.  However, the food was really good. I'm the worst person with decision making, so the choices had me deciding for a while. I ended up getting the Katsudon as I had a hankering for it. It was a quite good. Flavourful rice with onions and the pork cutlet was nicely done without it getting soggy, despite how wet the rice seemed. A decent sized portion for a reasonable price.  There was quite an extensive menu, so I'll definitely be back as it is a nice alternative when I get bored of some of the other Hone Kong style cafes in my area... which there are a ton of."}
{"text":"I was recommended to come here for the French toast cube - foods and drinks are okay. The workers here has a very poor attitudes and are so incredibly RUDE!!! With the sucky food and poor attitudes of the workers, I do NOT recommend coming here at all! If I can give them -5 stars, I would!"}
{"text":"So I've been trying many hk styled cafes and can now conclude that the smaller cafes usually have very low quality ingredients all the time. The waitresses are surprisingly decent but at the end of the day it really is all about the food and since the prices at these small cafes are basically the same you might as well go to like firefly or city Hollywood for better seating and quality."}
{"text":"Yesterday I came here with a group of 6 .. My hubby had the free range pork and I had the red wine ox tail... My hubby didn't like the pork cause of the stronge pork flavor... I actually enjoyed it and so I took over his plate ... He enjoyed the ox tail as it was made very tender! I order the Horlick slush !and he order the ice red bean drinks.. The pork came with a dessert which was mango pudding... After having three spoon full, got a sore throat and I thought it might of been an allergic reaction but now I think it might of been the cleanness of the spoon. Usually with allergies and think my lips would swell up too... For some reason my husband wanted to come again today... We order a salted chicken and a sirloin steak medium rare. Both came out with problems the chicken tasted blend which the baby likes and the steak tasted salty.... Overall, let's put it as baby liking it isn't enough for us the come back!!!! But at least one of us enjoyed our meals... I didn't get to take photos with my group as I was too embarrassed to be the only one to take photos of my food... So at the second time around I did!! Ps... The drinks weren't bad at all!!"}
{"text":"2.5/5  Been here a few times and I've never been impressed with the experience.  The menu options are limited compared to most other HK style cafes I've seen, though the prices were alright.  I decided to order the pan-fried pork chops with rice vermicelli noodles in soup, swayed by the promise of two \"thumbs up\" signs beside the dish on the menu.  I was hoping for a party in my mouth, fueled by a delectable dish that would make my palate beg for more.  Sadly, no.  Out came the waitress with a hammer to shatter my dreams, in the form of my noodles in a bowl and the pork chop served on the side.  There was no sauce in the noodles and barely any toppings, which led for the blandest vermicelli and soup I've ever had.  The pork chop itself was a tiny little thing, cut into even smaller pieces.  And why is it served on the side?  Do I eat the noodles and pork separate?  Do I put them together?  I can't make these complicated decisions on an empty stomach.  The meal was saved a little by the cubed french toast that I ordered to share.  I'm not sure if there are other restaurants that serve it cubed, but I really enjoyed that.  Such a simple twist on a classic item that makes eating it so much better.  I did like the french toast, though it looked ridiculously unhealthy.  Definitely not my favourite place to go."}
{"text":"This is a slightly outdated review (came here on May 13 for afternoon tea). I've heard from many other people that this place served delicious food and since I was in the area with a friend, we decided to give it a shot. Sadly, it did not meet our already low expectations... We did not have to wait in line as most people seemed like they were just eating and leaving rather than chatting. I had a feeling this place spoke Cantonese (which they did) but because I am not that fluent, I spoke English. I understand that this is an Asian based area however, it is close to LA fitness and other non-Asian stores. Therefore, I feel like the waitresses should at least TRY to speak English and start a conversation and/or respond to our questions about the dishes.  We ended up ordering a chicken dish, a latka (I believe that was the name), and their French toast cubes. The chicken was flavourful and I liked how their rice was fused with bok choy. For my friend, she ordered latka but stated that this was not how latka was made. It was in soup with noodles rather than rice and there was no indication of that in the menu. In addition, there was close to no flavouring so my friend added a lot of hot sauce to compensate . The French toast came later on with a side of butter and syrup. This dish was hard to mess up. Some cubes were more soggy than others but it is difficult to give every cube the same texture. I wasn't a fan of this but my friend was.  The only positive thing that I remembered as of now was how one of the waitresses brought over a sample of soup when I was asking what soup it was. Luckily, we didn't get charged for this as we didn't like it (or she probably just forgot or didn't care).  For the 3 dishes, we ordered 1 HK style milk tea and 2 lemon tea.  This is your typical HK style cafe in Markham. There is more variety compared to other restaurants but some dishes do need improvements or clarifications.  Also, some servers need a change in attitude, which seemed apparent towards anyone who wasn't a regular or fluent in Cantonese."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place! Good deals for afternoon tea. My favourite is their laksa and they make really good Hong Kong style milk tea (totally addicted)! While there is definitely room for improvement with their service, the prices are great so I really can't complain. The level of service is comparable to a lot of other similar type cafés. This place is cash only which can be an inconvenience - usually other cafés would at least take debit cards. Overall, this place is still one of my favourites and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Kiko cafe seems to be a fancier version of a hk style Cafe (similar to Fav Cafe) but the food was only average. We ordered the foie gras (Chef's Table offers tastier foie gras at a similar price), spaghetti vongole in white wine sauce (which was mediocre), and shrimp and chicken laksa (which was lacking in flavour).  My main issue with this restaurant was the service. My friends have warned me of their poor customer service but my standards for customer service at Chinese restaurants is very low so I thought I'd still give the place a try... Needless to say, I definitely won't be coming back.  Waitresses were somewhat friendly and served us at the beginning while the waiter was on what appeared to be his lunch break. I wished the waitresses could have continued serving us for the rest of our meal because the waiter was incredibly rude. When we politely asked him for a takeout container and the bill he glared at us and walked away. He came back with a container and no plastic bag to go with it although the table next to us received both. He then saw that we put $100 down for our ~$54 meal (we even made eye contact as I tried to get his attention) but he kept walking by without acknowledging it so we had to ask the waitress to bring us the change and a plastic bag when she came over to clean the table beside ours. When the waitress placed the ~$46 of change down on the table, he IMMEDIATELY walked by to pick it up and mumbled a thank you as he walked away. We called after him saying that that was our change and INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING he became defensive and rude. The first thing he said (in Chinese) was \"hey, there's no need to get mad. I didn't know.\" Yea. Right. As if anyone would ever leave a $46 tip at this place.  His attitude was unacceptable and made us leave the restaurant feeling angry and unwelcomed."}
{"text":"I have only been to this place a few times based on a friend's recommendation. The decor is simple and clean, not like some other HK style cafes that belongs to the sub-par when it comes to being clean. Onto the service, not much can be said about this. The ladies will quickly get you seated and checks on you when you need to place order. Onto the food. I ordered the Nasi gareng (sp), it's a Malaysian style fried rice. This dish has a bit of a kick that I wasn't used to. But after the heat has subsided, I find the taste to be good and not overpowering. My friends ordered a baked fish fillet with white sauce on rice casserole and a curry fried pork on rice. Those are their go to dishes. Overall, this place isn't bad. Service wise, can improve? But I am probably spoiled by Western restaurants' service. So I can't use that here."}
{"text":"I like Kiko Cafe because they have a variety of drinks - the drink is always key in each of these cafes! While the Tom Yum soup base lacks flavour, the other items I've tried on the menu has got me going back for more.  http://www.theroadtripgirl.com/under-10-meals-my-top-hk-cafes-for-afternoon-tea/"}
{"text":"Today since not that many people I came to try it out. Have a a la king on rice and it was very average. Last time I came it was a line up so I left thinking must be a very good restaurant. Service was good but no salt and pepper in table."}
{"text":"Used to enjoy this place a lot before. But recently I've came here three times and was super disappointed at the quality of service and food and milk tea.  They are downgrading A LOT in their quality of food. The meat sauce cheese spaghetti is run down with water and it tastes very dull and the sauce isn't enough to cover the noodles.  The size of the cups for milk tea is a lot smaller and the milk tea lacks sugar and milk. Had to ask for extra milk a couple of times. It doesn't even taste like milk tea at all.  The service is unfriendly and the women here are always rude and no smiles. Not that I expected much from a cafe like this but it sure does not feel welcoming especially when you are young they disrespect you the most.   The overall quality of this cafe is disappointing. I will definitely not come back again. With the service, food, milk tea being so unbearable."}
{"text":"We wanted some HK Style cuisine so we decided to go to Kiko as it was close by. Their menu has quite a good selection with good choices of set meals. We decided to try their \"free-range\" pork chop which we were told would take a bit longer than our curry fish cutlet with rice. It did take quite a bit longer as we were almost done our curry before the pork chop came out. The wait was worth it as the pork chop itself was quite delicious. However the spaghetti that came with it was so bland that even our preschooler wouldn't eat it. The curry fish was average though (the curry fish at Phoenix) is better. It had little pieces of pumpkin in there too. The soup that came with the meal resembled Campbell's tomato soup with flour added so it was quite unpalatable to say the least. I ordered a honey lemon and I've had better. All that being said, there were quite a few patrons and the service was friendly. We just wish that the food tasted better."}
{"text":"French Toast Cubes (~$4.75) - My friend had a bigger plate than mine heh. -v-;; Aside from that, it tastes amazing. They're freshly made; crunchy and melt in your mouth along with the butter you dip it in.  They have wifi here!"}
{"text":"use to like this place, my third time ordering sirloin steak with rice and this time yuck the steak is super salty, texture of the meat feels like its been marinated for at least 10 days. The colour is road kill red. One of the most awful steak I've ever had in my life. I took a picture I wish I know how to upload it with this review. Business is tough but serving food like this isn't acceptable even in north korea. All in all I took 3 bites and decided to tell the waitress about it and she said I should have told her on my first bite so she could show it to the chef, not sure why that matters but I told her thats ok im not planning to finish it so you can still show it to the chef, she took it back and came out said she can give me a french toast for free. so at the end i ate 3 bites of nasty meat, some toast and paid the full bill, and i can feel the steak in my stomach as im typing. the table next to me also complained about their food (not sure if it's the steak). waitress attitude is also bad, the soup is basically tasteless so i asked her for salt and pepper and she gave me this look like im crazy, and this is before the steak incident."}
{"text":"Now that I went to this place for a few times already, I have to just say this cafe is just an OK.  Came here for afternoon tea, lunch and dinner and I think their lunch and dinner is a little too expensive for HK Cafe standards.  I am perfectly fine if the food quality justifies the price tag, but this place clearly does not meet the price tag.  The baked rice are just an okay, sauce is not that flavorful and I thought more sauce would be better, but they do use fried rice.  Lunch is also pretty similar, nothing too special with the soup beef noodles.  Afternoon tea on the other hand, I was pretty impressed. Price tags seem reasonable to me and their signature cube french toast is pretty decent!  Great texture and fried to perfection.  If only they offer the peanut better stuffing version, that would of been perfect.  Overall, a place to go for afternoon tea, otherwise, there are a lot of other options."}
{"text":"Been here quite a lot when they first opened, but stopped coming because they have terrible service. Way to go to ruin their reputation.."}
{"text":"This little HK style cafe won me over with their cubed style french toast (didn't hurt it was free with coupon either!), classic meat sauce spaghetti and their decent cup of milk tea! Most of their meals come with a drink so for $7.95 spaghetti and milk tea is decently priced, I think.  They have a few specialty items on the menu that I wouldn't expect at HK style places...foie gras on toast, porterhouse steak?! It has intrigued me to go again and try their dinner one day. Service was mediocre but for HK style places, it's really the norm.  They are still giving out coupons for their unique twist on french toast, good til Oct 15, 2015 (weekdays only)."}
{"text":"HK style cafe serving Japanese, western, Malaysian, and Korean style dishes. Perhaps they are biting off more than they can chew. While their Korean rice dish and laksa noodles seemed average, their other dishes such as the baked rice/ spaghetti leaves little to be desired.   While one dish was way way too salty, another would lack completely in flavor. The inconsistencies make dining here a bit of a gamble. There is no denying that their platings look fantastic and the dishes look appealing, but I think this is a case of \"looks better than it tastes\".   If you come just for the afternoon tea snacks, I think you might be a bit better satisfied. The brick toast is a bit of a hit and miss, but when it's good, is really good. Haha. Like I said, it's a bit of a gamble.  Service is terrible but that's what you get at a small hk cafe with few staff and lots of people. No big deal. Atleast they aren't rude. They are just very busy. The decor keeps the room looking fresh and bright. It's a small space but I think they did their best with it and they are flexible with moving tables to accommodate larger groups. That being said, I would not recommends you come in large groups. :)   It's not a bad cafe, it's just not a fantastic one either."}
{"text":"Came here for afternoon tea and it was disappointing.   French Toast Cubes - looks better than it tastes. At first bite, a mouthful of oil - at least that's how you know it's freshly deep fried! Crispy outside, soggy inside from the combination of half toast and half milk custard pudding? (Not sure if it is really milk custard, just something mushy) Topped with condensed milk, I think it could be improved with some PB inside or topped with some syrup/honey too for dipping.   Pork Chop Cutlet with Cheese Instant Noodle - instant noodle with a white \"cheese\" sauce, no soup. Only tried one bite, meh. Pork chop was ok though - thin and crispy.   Cold milk tea was better than hot milk tea."}
{"text":"3rd visit: We finally gotta tried the French toast cubes but it was totally disappointing. The toast was so oily and greasy and soggy.... For the soup, it was onion soup that night and it was so salty as if salt is free. Onto the main course, we both had Japanese style pork cutlet don and.... Right away u can tell that it's not crispy because it's light colored rather than golden brown like we first tried it. And the rice part, so watery it's like eating ??... In terms of service this time was much nicer. FYI it was a Monday so maybe the mean lady wasn't in on Mondays :p  Conclusion for the three visits: hit or miss. Given the fact that there are so many restaurants out there and the inflation, I'll probably visit somewhere else and come here less often.   Second time here got an Indonesian style fried rice. The flavor was too strong to my liking.  And got the free deep fried mushroom which was ok. But the service wasn't that good. The waitress tried to drop off a dish that we didn't order. And when we said its not ours she still wanna put it down and question us as if we made a wrong order.  I definitely saw apparent differences in service offered to a frequent patron vs an ordinary customer. More smile, food came out quicker.   1st visit: This is actually not bad. To me the menu isn't as extensive (because I skipped the parts about the combo for 2 and combo for four), but it does offer dishes that aren't like typical hk style restaurant? Anyway..... Came here Friday night at around 615, seated right away.  Ordered a pork cutlet (Japanese style) and a chicken thigh with veggie rice. Idk..... It somehow gave me some homey feeling..... Lol The combo comes with a borscht soup and a drink. We upgraded to a cold milk tea and one of the kiko specialty drinks - a hot almond egg white which I really like! Each for a dollar more.  I really want to try The French toast that other yelpers talked about!  When we got our bill we were given a coupon for the fresh toast... And they also have a Vicinity loyalty card program which you can collect points."}
{"text":"??????Kiko??????????????????????Portion ?????????????????????dressing ??? over pour the duck breast made the duck taste funny? Waitress serving ???????????????????. Honestly when you out for lunch or dinner, the idea is to enjoy the food and atmosphere of the restaurant environment....but this restaurant is fail on both....so disappointed."}
{"text":"This business is suppose to be a HongKong cafe. I enjoy most HK cafés, but this one is an exception and I will explain why. So I'm sitting here waiting for my food and it's been over 30 minutes. I ordered Sausage and Fried Egg w/ Vermicelli. First of all if u take a look at my photo those were hotdogs, not sausages. Secondly, I don't think I got vermicelli in my order. Lastly, how long does it take to fry an egg, heat up some hotdogs and put it together with noodles and soup? The soup was quite flavourless I might add. I completely regret my decision in ordering that dish and possibly regret even stepping foot in that cafe. First experiences matter and I don't think a second chance is an option. That being said I will not return and I don't suggest anyone else visiting this place either."}
{"text":"Is an average cafe.  I came here because I saw couple postings from my friends.  I ordered the shrimp chicken laksa.  The shrimp was great, however you can taste the chicken came out from the freezer :( overall most dishes are on the salty side.  Prob will not come back for awhile."}
{"text":"I was in the area, and I heard of this restaurant from the Chinese radio commercial, so I thought, \"Hey why don't I give them a try?\" BUT, I WARN YOU NOW: DO NOT FALL FOR THE COMMERCIAL and DO NOT COME HERE. My first time here, and they will not see my return. Even if an epidemic causes all restaurants nearby to all shut down, I would still much rather scour my fridge for leftovers than to come back to Kiko.  First impression: welcoming clean outdoor image, decor inside is new and minimal. But once you meet the people operating the restaurant you see the real side of it.   A couple waitresses were available as my party stood by the door waiting to be seated.  I remember our eyes locking. I really thought we had a mutual feeling. But this must've all only been imaginative. All these seconds we stood there with our eyes locked, we were returned with only blank stares. The weirdest thing is thinking... I MUST have the power of invisibility. I looked at my hands, I am normal. It was not me, it was them.  The menu. Things looked plain and overpriced. Yet we ordered a Thick toast (plain and overpriced), some sort of spicy Tom Yum soup with fish (plain and overpriced), and lastly Satay vermicelli with beef (yes, you guessed it- plain and overpriced!).  Took the waitresses 10 minutes AFTER ordering before bringing us drinks-- which turned out to be hot water. Not hot tea... but water. WHO IN THE WORLD (of chinese style restaurants), serves HOT WATER!?   If washrooms are a clear indication of the organization and quality of the restaurant...This restaurant is probably ran by lazy people who are dirty and messy.   The waitresses were also RUDE. Heck I have never served time. But i would think that is how an inmate gets served food, with food thrown onto your table like you're unworthy.  I know what you're thinking, there must be SOME positives? I will give them this, their milk tea was decent, and the two TVs in there were big and HD. That is it and ONLY it.  I dont think I emphasized how rude the waitresses were. If I didn't feel guilty not tipping, and If i wasn't afraid of the c-lai waitresses chasing me out to the parking lot for not tipping, I probably wouldn't have.   Man, I really should've just scoured my fridge for food today..."}
{"text":"What a wonderful convenient location.  We came here this evening looking forward to trying the french toast cubes which Jennifer K. pointed out, but was disappointed to find we couldn't order any of the lunch/breakfast items (other HK style places offer it whole day).  Not even noodle in soup could be ordered.  Only dinner menu items, drinks, and snacks.  Was not overly impressed with the menu selection, as the evening menu items were quite pricey ($18 and up) including the specials highlighted on the wall.   We ended ordering the following from snack section :  Stir Fried Mixed Vegetables with Butter  $4.95 Sweet Potato Fries  $5.50  **note it was $3.50 on menu and they honored the typo**  For the small portion that we got, we felt $5.50 would have been a rip off for the sweet potato fries.  Thankfully we only paid $3.50 for it.  The staff was friendly though, nice new and clean decor.  They also serve alcohol.  Overall a nice place for snacks and drinks."}
{"text":"Came here not for actual food but just for some snacks/desserts and milk tea.   Got what they call a creme brule on the menu for $3.25 but its really egg pudding with some caramelized sugar on top. Not too bad but definately not a creme brule.   Also got the cubed French toast with condensed milk $4.75. OMG!!! Heaven in my mouth. Fluffy and light on the inside and crispy on the outside. Drizzled with a nice amount of condensed milk and a side of butter which was not really needed but I used it anyway just to make it taste even better. I wish they had honey on the side because that would have just put it over the edge. Mental note to self: bring honey from home the next time I get these amazing little French toast cubes.   To wash things down got a HK style milk tea $1.90. Nice and smooth and on par with other HK style milk teas in the area.  Seating is very close and akward just like others have mentioned. Service is fastpaced but friendly at the same time."}
{"text":"With the encouragement of a promotional coupon, I am back.  Is the second time around better?  Amazingly, yes.  The dishes and bowls are still cold (I failed to mention this last time around), but the service is much better.  With more people actually on the floor to serve the people, Friday night dinner actually went relatively smoothly.  Steak was the order this time around, and while I had ordered \"Medium\", I couldn't help but notice my steak was closer to \"Medium-Well\".  However, it's not bad, and won't make you disgusted, but it's a far better choice than the Nasi Goreng I ordered last time around.    It's not perfect, but I think it's now a bit more enticing to return."}
{"text":"I've come here on several occasions and I must say that this is a decent Hong Kong cafe.  Good HK style cafes are extremely hard to come by these days because you run into a dilemma of the food being too salty or food lacks flavour; and then you also run into the problem of HK style tea being either too full of tannins or too creamy.    I'm happy to say that Kiko Cafe has nailed it almost spot on.  One of my favourite dishes there is the free range pork chop they have.  The portion is definitely HUGE and can be shared but the pork is delicious.  I'm usually very picky about my pork but they seem to have the seasoning just right there and cooked to perfection, which I'm so surprised with.  Usually, these meals come with a soup - either cream soup or Russian borscht.  Their borscht is actually pretty well made - unlike the watered down version in many HK cafe counterparts.    They do have a dessert at the end, which I'm never a fan of.  It's usually some egg/creme brûlée pudding.  I wouldn't take my word for the review of the dessert because any sort of creme brûlée grosses me out to no end because I have texture issues with it.  I always look around and it appears as though all the other patrons are happily eating away at it.  :)   Ambiance wise - don't expect to come here for a candlelight dinner or a quiet dinner date because you aren't going to get one.  It's an HK style cafe - it's going to be noisy for sure.  It can also be quite crowded at times and when there's a lot of people, your food can take forever to come.  Otherwise, it's pretty smooth running.  Their drinks are also brewed quite nicely!  Cost wise, everything is very reasonable and on the \"low cost\" side of things :)."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Not sure what's going on lately here, but service has gone downhill in my past two visits.  I've come here enough times for the employees to recognize me and if the place isn't too busy, stop by my table and chat for a bit. However lately I've noticed the employees not only stopped acknowledging me, but also they're not as happy-go-lucky as before, as in they get agitated quite easily. It could be a sign the boss is being a little greedy and not giving the employees a share of the tips.  I still haven't noticed a decrease in food quality for lunch or afternoon tea compared to some of the more recent reviews, but I haven't been here for dinner in a while now. I'll probably update my review once I have a dinner meal here in the future."}
{"text":"Your typical HK modern style cafe, selection is limited to mainly curry, baked stuff, and western style dishes like pork chop and steak...decently priced and kind of crammed...they serve liquor btw by I wouldn't want to come here for a beer or something, would only come back if I was craving curry as it was pretty good"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Hong Kong cafes style restaurants, and this place is definitely a neighbourhood gem. Love their braised oxtail dish. Also, their chicken curry stews come with roasted pumpkins and mushrooms vs the standard carrots and potatoes."}
{"text":"Kiko is a small HK style café located in the Michael Angelo's plaza on Woodbine & Hwy7. I had seen it around for many years but never stopped in to try it.  Their menu offers an extensive variety of foods from sandwiches to French toast to noodle soups to baked rice/spaghettis!   Malaysian fried rice: This was delicious but a little too salty for my liking, comes with a handful of generous sized shrimps, topped with a fried egg and shrimp chip!  Laksa noodles: This was really good, the broth was slightly spicy and very flavourful, with a combination of egg noodles and rice noodles (we got the shrimp and chicken one).  Almond milk with egg whites: For an extra $1 (with combo) we upgraded to this beverage..it's rare to find a place in the GTA that makes this beverage with the egg whites.. it was steamy hot and had very thin slithers of egg whites in it.  Overall, I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu...including the reasonably priced afternoon tea menu, the French toast cubes.  PS. They have a vincity rewards points program!"}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow, but they have good food. The nasi goreng was a massive portion, the rice had lots of flavour and yes it's spicy! The spaghetti with bolognese sauce was well done - the bolognese sauce was not oily but had lots of meat and cheese. We used a promotion providing a free sizzling pork hock for purchases over $45 and it was good - very soft and tender and the gravy was good too. We also ordered a french toast dessert which was great - deep fried cubes of bread - crunchy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside and drizzled with condensed milk with a nicely presented butter flower.  I found the soup to be watery. The hot milo was good. It gets pretty loud in the restaurant and they seem to be quite busy.  They use Vicinity Rewards and their rewards rate is about 10% (on paper) but in practice, I think there is some sort of tiered system meaning you get less than what you paid. If you have an unbranded card, they will stick a Kiko Cafe sticker on it (which I didn't like).  They have free WiFi, no password necessary."}
{"text":"Foods are fine but it definitely went down hill. Same as the service. For the same price, I ll prefer somewhere else. If you expect more than just food. I won't suggest this place.   I ordered a rice with curry pork. It only came with so little curry sauce. It was too plain without the curry sauce. I talked to the waiter. He said I didn't tell them to add more sauce when I ordered (omg, who knows it doesn't come with enough sauce) he said they made the sauce per order. If I want, I can wait until someone order and then he can ask chef to make some sauce for me. I said ok. I will wait as it really too dry without the sauce. After more than 20 mins, the sauce arrived. I assumed it ll will be hot enough as the waiter said they made it per order. It's not hot or anything. Seems like he just pour it from a pot. So why did he made me waited all the time... I was so hungry before I ordered and I lost my appetite after the whole thing.  Bad experience from last time and this time. I don't think I will go again."}
{"text":"Decent HK diner/cafe in Markham. Solid quality and price for the food. Not one of my favourites though for afternoon tea due to the limited selection  of healthier noodles.. They offer many fried foods for their afternoon tea... hence the 3 star. But if I am craving the fried foods (pork cutlet, chicken wings, pineapple buns, shrimp toast etc), I recommend coming here!  My favourite is the HK french toast cubes!! So delicious! I think I prefer the cube version over the toast version just because there's more fried parts haha. The insides are very soft..mmm. It's $4.75 for this and a drink."}
{"text":"The food was yummy, but the service was horrible. I felt like we were rushed and sometimes waited for our drink order. The wait staff is understaffed maybe inexperienced. Rude management. Will not come again."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time today...  I live down the street from here but never came because a couple friends had negative reviews of this place.  But ended up trying this place out for afternoon tea last week and turns out I actually like this place!  It's a bit squishy inside because it's a small restaurant with quite a few tables.  Service is average, but the food by far is pretty good.  I haven't gotten around to try a lot of dishes yet, but il definitely come back for more!  I'm very picky with vermicelli, and this place makes it pretty good!  But I definitely agree with the other reviews, they do charge little extra fees here and there for takeout and such, but with the economy now, it's not surprising.  Cant really blame them, they're not the only restaurant charging those fees!"}
{"text":"Located right across L.A Fitness! They have pretty good food and I like coming here for tea!  Service is just decent, but sometimes there's that really rude lady that looks like she hates the world, so it really just depends on who's working that day.  Some of their dishes are super yummy and unique (mini french toast cubes) but some are just mediocre. My personal favourite is their mini french toast cubes, SUPER YUM!~  Other than that, I can't really think of anything else to say. Their food isn't bad but pretty average stuff that you can get anywhere. Try some foods from their specials menu, some are quite yummy~"}
{"text":"The good: this place has amazing pictures from the reviews from people. When I searched this place up, I was very excited to try this. The milk tea was decent.   The bad: the food is really mediocre. I ordered the roti with curry, potato waffles and my boyfriend ordered the ox tongue with Portuguese sauce on rice. All of this didn't leave me wanting for more...instead I only finished half. The curry, roti and the potato waffle was a variation of what it normally tastes like. It was edible but not appetizing.   I would still be interested in trying the French toast but wouldn't want to be disappointed again."}
{"text":"Went there half hr before they close, the service was horrible, the lady had so much attitude. Food wasn't great either, I asked my steak MR, but it came out with half part MR (thick part)and half well done(thin part). My husband enjoyed his chicken. The place is clean. Won't come back..."}
{"text":"Solid four stars, and maybe even a 5 star. This Hong Kong style cafe almost transported me back to childhood with simple menus of baked rice and spaghetti dishes drenched in yummy black pepper sauce. My friend said she knew I would love this place and she was right!  She ordered the baked spaghetti bolognaise and I ordered the porkchop baked rice baked in blackpepper sauce. It was ridiculously declicious, especially the spaghetti. At first I was hesitant about the idea of eating pasta in HK syle cafe, but it really blew me away! It's honestly a must try here.  The prices here are really good too. about $7 per dish, plus a free coffee or tea. Service is spectacular. The only snag in the entire experience is that they are CASH ONLY. No cards whatsoever, which really sucked since the nearest ATM is in a cash station a bit far down.   Great place!"}
{"text":"Kiko Cafe is a Hong Kong Style cafe that just opens up in the same plaza as Michael-Angelos.   Typical as the tables are so close together that's not much privacy as I can almost hear everything everyone in the restaurant are talking about. Noise level here is unbelievable high even with the place is not even half full.   Two TVs showing sport channels.. And is licensed.. Maybe it can be a sport bar but it closes early at 10 pm. At least I know I won't be watching the Leafs here tonight.  Afternoon Tea Set starting at 2:30 pm and with All Day Specials offers plus Daily Specials on the wall.   French Toast Cube with Milk Tea ($4.50) is really tasty. All these deep fried goodness drizzled with condensed milk on top.   Not too many healthy options but it is after all not really a healthy choice to eat at Hong Kong Style Cafe after all.   I will definitely give Kiko Cafe another try for lunch.. Cannot resist a lunch Special."}
{"text":"This is a typical HK diner so I didn't walk in with much expectation.   Ordered:   Laksa with shrimp and chicken: I didn't personally eat it but it seemed very watery. Also, theres 2 different types of noodles in the dish. I haven't seen that before so don't know if thats the \"correct\" Laska or not (I don't think it is though).  Ox tail with rice: Very SALTY and very FATTY.  There was a whole layer of fat with little meat in each piece. I've definitely had better ox tail before.   All combos came with a drink, specialty drinks were a minimum of 0.50 extra depending on which drink you order. I ordered Ribena soda with lemon and it was okay. But recommend you to ask for less ice as the ice made it very difficult to poke the lemon. Drink was eh. Nothing special and not worth the extra 1.75.  Overall: I don't think I will be coming back. I would rather eat at Phoenix than here."}
{"text":"I would give it a 3.5 stars as the food quality and service has gone down the past year but since my boyfriend loves their deep fried chicken leg (as such, I do frequent quite often), I'll bump up my rating.   This is a great place to go for their afternoon tea (11:00am - 5:30pm) as their food is quite reasonably priced especially for the quality you get. I would recommend you try: Baked Salted Chicken with Vegetable Rice in Bowl, Fish Cutlet Potato Salad, Tom Yum Noodle, Kiko Club Sandwich, and the Deep Fried Chicken Leg on Rice with Peppercorn Sauce.   The downside is that it's a cash only place so it makes it more difficult for those who rely heavily on their credit/debit cards."}
{"text":"For me this is more of a lunch spot as I wouldn't consider it for dinner. My absolute favourite menu item is the chicken curry with rice which I find to be consistently good, Tom yum beef noodle is good most of the time but sometimes it feels like they are trying to stretch the broth, same with the laksa soup. Their milk tea coffee is amazing. I've also had their French toast squares which are pretty good if your in the mood for sweets. Over all it's a good value for the food you get.   That being said some of the menu items are really good and worth it but some are not so much. You kind of need to use your head when ordering. That being said you can't really go wrong for the price."}
{"text":"This is my first time come but for sure this will be my last time...Very bad service, food taste bad and very pricey"}
