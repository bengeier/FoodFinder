{"text":"Yeah Bert's is good! Very good! popped in many times as it is very close to home and easy to run in and out of...

Try it when your in my neck of the woods and don't forget the soup!!!"}
{"text":"I forgot this place was even still open; it's easy to miss from the street and never saw anyone parked by there. 

But never fear: alternatives to fast food in Old Brooklyn are here ! 

An actual sandwich deli in Old Brooklyn, all right ! Besides Gentile's and Goodman's, this is the only one and I'm glad to know this is also here. 
There are soups of the day, 12oz for ~$4 [the tomato bisque sounded tempting !] Instead, I opted for one of their hot sandwiches, BBQ roast beef and cheese. 
The sandwiches are served on your choice of rye, kaiser roll, white or wheat. The BBQRB (less than $7) was all right. A nice amount of meat [although the sauce is put on as the sandwich is made, not as the meat is cooked] , tangy BBQ sauce, and American cheese; the sandwich filled me up although some of the meat was not very warm. The sandwiches come with a pickle and were made in front of me [less than 5 minutes] and people behind the counter were really nice. There was also potato salads and deli meats as well. 

Just note, there isn't any seating here (that I saw at least), so it's takeout only. 

I'll be willing to make another visit (it's just down the road from the sausage shoppe too)."}
{"text":"Bert's is a great Deli if your looking for an alternative to fast food that's still fast and cheap. Though their corned beef doesn't quite have the slow-cooked tenderness of Goodman's (nor do they have the short hours and lines half-way around the block) they do offer a giant version of the standard (already huge) corned beef that is at least 6 inches high. As another reviewer noted, there is no seating as the deli is carry out only."}
