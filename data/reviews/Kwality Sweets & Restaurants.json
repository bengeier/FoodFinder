{"text":"The curried goat had too much oil, and was not tender the way goat kharai should be. The daal, chana, and rass malai were average. You would expect better quality food for the price you're paying.

The one time I bought samosas from them , they turned out to be stale. 

It would seem like they just want to get a quick turnover rather than focus on quality food now, they were a reputable establishment a few years back."}
{"text":"Great Chana batura, nice service. Would definitely want to go back here again next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"I know Toronto is a fair spell from LA. And it has a million Indo-Paki places. In fact I claim that Brampton is being re-named Brownsville! And Niagara Falls should be called New Delhi Falls. But the main problem may be to sort among all these places. I was taken here for lunch by my brother who had that 'tah-dah' look about him.
Considering our own family kitchens turn out killer food, it had to be extra special. This was several cuts (are puns now my keynote?)above the various other offerings in town, and more expensive as well (tho by no means unreasonable) That it was pretty full when we got there at 1 pm, and bursting when we left, shows that discerning palates are willing to so the extra mile for the good stuff!  And good it was! We had the Karahi Ghost as well as my main reason for going to 'desi' restaurants anywhere....hot naans direct from the tandoor!
Tho I confess to not trying enough dishes at this place to stake my life on it, the stuff i stuffed down makes me confident that anything from their menu would be worth ordering. My brother Don vouches for it, and I'd love to add the extra star...maybe when they finally get a liquor licence so I can quaff a cold one with my curry and naan!"}
{"text":"Been getting take out from here for a while and finally ate here last weekend. Tried couple of weeks ago as well and the place was packed. Overall the food was fantastic. Had the chana bhatura, palak paneer, shahi paneer, karhi, and a thali which was a lot of food but we ended up finishing it all. 

They have the best karhi so I will continue to return unless I can figure out how to make it"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Kwality! it reminds me of Haldirams'. me and my husband eats brunch here almost every Saturday morning. Our favorites here are - 
Chhole Bhature; baingan masala; masala chai, masal dosa; mango lassi; mango shake etc.
They are run by punjabi's however their sambhar is much better than teh south indian restaurants we've been to so far in the toronto area.
The stuffed paranthas were not that good.

Their service is super fast. I absolutely love our server. He the guy with moustache. You will know him by his service. Other servers are alright too."}
{"text":"Great food, staff are extremely rude, but the foods good. I call this place the \"Indian food Nazis\". Its great, but be ready for some good ol' fashioned bitchy staff."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food - I've been here dozens of times and the fresh, soft nans, the perfectly spiced curries with tender meat morsels, delicious vegetarian dishes, tandoori dishes (especially the minced goat kebabs), vegetarian thalis, and delicious desserts keep me coming back for more.  The food is not only delicious, but the prices are great.  In fact, a vegetarian thali is only $7.50 and is impossible to finish because of the quantity of food.  This is among the best Indian food in the GTA - in fact, I can't think of an Indian restaurant I'd rather eat at.  

Simply amazing."}
{"text":"I had there sweets and tbh it was delicious..I went there on a friend's recommendation and it was worth it."}
{"text":"So I used to go here for weekend breakfast.

I have eaten their Chana Bhatura, Pao bhaji, Thaali, Chai, Pakoras, Tikkas etc.

Every time I go, their servers have a very disappointing look on their faces. They don't appear friendly and professional.

One time (my last time) I asked for server to take my order for Chai, he told me that he would return in a minute to take my order and then he never came back.

I wanted 15 min. looking around in a hope to see him and order for some more food. But they lost the business.

Since then, I haven't gone to this place again.

Pros: Tasty food!! No doubts
Cons: Pathetic service. No care for customer

Would I recommend this place? No Way!!"}
{"text":"Steer clear, bad service, food was ok. I was turned off from the cleanliness. The staff wiped the table clean after he picked up the rag from the floor. Never go back there...."}
{"text":"worst food in entire Brampton with worst service and rude staff.. the waiters are very harsh.... typical desi style... had a very bad experience twice... and when u say plz call your manager.. they just say.. \"do whatever you can\".
Try other restaurants in the are.. 100% better food and very friendly staff...
This is the worst restaurant i have ever tried in my entire life... too much oily and stale food served.. they think they have monopoly.. but not now.. will just say never step in at this place"}
{"text":"Every nice family restaurant. I had sweet lassi,  muttar paneer and chicken tikka kabab. The lassi was good, the muttar paneer was okay and the chicken tikka could have been better. The service was really good and efficient. The sweet were over priced and no guarantee how old they are."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places for South Asian food in the city. Prices are great and service is nice as well. Great for take out."}
{"text":"Excellent! Very authentic and amazing in flavor. Butter chicken is outstanding. Very good non bread. It is not a fancy restaurant where you can have a romantic dinner, but if you are looking for a good ethnic food and do not mind to drive to Brampton, this is a place to go. It will totally redefine your experience and attitude to Indian cuisines. There is no  restaurant in downtown Toronto, North York, Richmond Hill or Scarborough that has such a good food and fair value. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was OK and expensive. We have had better here in California for less.
Servers were nice and prompt. If you pay in US$ be very carefull about how much change you get back. It seems the staff will tell you one rate when you ask them prior to paying your bill and the Owner will charge you a much higher exchange rate when he gets your money. When I brought it up to their attention, they could not care less! Not going back to this crooked place!"}
{"text":"The promotion they advertised online is hoax.. The servers and cashiers are not aligned with each other. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Since this place is always so packed and busy, I always do take out. Being one of the best Indian restaurants, constantly expanding their menu and restaurant space I have a lot more to try. They have the best chat papri, chole bhatura's and chicken kebabs along with their sweets of course. However, I do not recommend the pastries or brownies as they were stale and stiff the time I bought them for a trial (see picture). Give this place a try if you're looking for good \"quality\" food and especially if you are trying an Indian cuisine for the very first time."}
{"text":"Good stuff .. I went here to get sweets for the engagement celebration. Restaurant had good food we tried chole bhature, dosa and it was delicious. Will go back soon."}
{"text":"Ate their channa batura and was not very impressed. The batura was way too oily for my liking."}
{"text":"Food - we ordered the butter chicken, chicken tikka, naan and rice.  Nothing special, the naan was ok, not hot and crispy.  The rice was room temperature.  Sweet Palace is way better.  This is our first time and will be our last.

Ambiance - don't expect much. Run of the mill Indian restaurant.  Decor and setting is not a priority,

Service - subpar

Cleanliness - we didn't dare to drink the glasses of water as the glasses were dirty.  If you don't mind seeing food morsels on the floor and crumbs on the chairs, then you are good to go."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!! Went with a massive crowd with lot of little ones to have brunch at this place and I was quite surprised in a good way that is. 

As you enter the restaurant; after parking your car (plenty of parking), there are two sections to the place. Right side is for the restaurant and sweets (methai) where as the left side is for ice- cream and paan (which consists of fillings wrapped in a triangular package using leaves of the Betel pepper, and could be sweet or bitter depending on what you prefer)

The restaurant itself was very clean and up kept, they had plenty of staff to take care of the crowd. As we were a big group they gave us a closed big section at the back, which was kind of nice to seat all of us. The cooking area and where the place where the food was kept was clean. 

The service was splendid. The server was present at all times and took our order properly. They came fast to clean the glass of water which fell on the ground. Then there was a lady walking around checking if everything was ok. They also turned the TVs on in that section which was nice. 

Now the food. My cousin was on about how their Chana Bhatura was awesome, so we all went to try that. As soon as we looked at the menu we knew we need to try more things as the menu had a lot of AWESOME selection. Hence, we ordered:

1. Parantha -  A whole wheat bread stuffed with spices and choice of Muli (dikon,) Aloo (potatoes,) or Gobi (cauliflower). We ordered Aloo Parantha, It was decent but I wanted the Aloo to be spicy. The bread came with a sauce to dip. 

2. Onion Rava Masala Dosa - Rava shell stuffed wtih potatoes, onions, green chilli, ginger, black pepper and spices. Stuffing was to the full and quite filling. Watch out for the watery sauce it is exceptionally spicy.  

3. Masala Dosa - Stuffed with potatoes.

4. Pizza Utthapam - Mixed vegetables, tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese

5. Channa Bhatura / Puri - Chick peas cooked in authentic spices & served with fried bread. Enough to feed 2 people just order an extra Bhatura. 

6. Thali - Three vegetables with rice, raita, salad, achar, dessert & naan or roti or extra rice. We have a lot of vegetables to choose from.

7. On the side/ Dessert we ordered Sweet Lassi, Salty Lassi, Mango Shake, Mango Lassi and a cake. 

Pizza Utthapam was not a hit with adults as well as kids but everything else passed the flying colours. Overall, the quality, quantity, and taste of the food was very good. The service was great! and the menu is easy on the pockets."}
{"text":"Mr. H and I went to Kwality since I was craving Chole Bhature and that turned out to be the only thing we liked.

Although I made reservations we never needed them since the place was not too packed. We ordered the Tandoori Platter with Seekh Kabab (goat)(good), Paneer Tikka (better than good), Chicken Tikka (so average) and Chicken Hariyali (uh..).

We also tried the Pani Puri which was so average and don't even get me started on the Kulfi Faluda... let's just say I never finished it.... and it's still lying in my fridge... I should probably toss it out."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite. The food tasted good but the reason why it's two stars is cause I saw a waiter walking with a plate of food and he touched the food with his hand to straighten it as he was walking to the guests table. 
So not sure if I'd want to come back because of that. It has a lot of potential because the food and sweets taste good. They just need to figure out service."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved their Chana batura!! So delicious. I ordered the mango milk shake, pain puri, dosa, and veggi thalli, and everything was SO GREAT!! The only thing is the restaurant isn't super clean and it's not fine dining! Defiantly would be going back when I am in Brampton next"}
{"text":"I read a lot about how the Batura Chole was great at this place, so I went to try it out. I also ordered a mango lassi to accompany it. It took around 20 minutes for the order to be delivered.  Unfortunately the dish was not what it was cracked up to be. The Batura was very oily and soggy. I can understand the oil part as it is fried, but not the soggy part. An authentic Batura should be puffed up slightly crispy on the outside.  The mango lassi was ok, but not outstanding. 

Will I try this restaurant again?  I don't know. There seem to be a lot of punjabi restaurants in Brampton. Maybe I will give one of those other restaurants a shot."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!
I honestly thing it has the best indian food in town! 
Im happy with what I order every time, and we always have left overs to enjoy at home.

The staffing can get confusing since you dont have 1 set waiter, random people come up to you. 

I take all my friends there when they ask to \"try something different\", so the staff is starting to recognize my face. 

Just thinking about the place makes me want some good indian cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is always packed ! Had delicious chole bhature, though they were a bit oily. The mango lassi was super. But the golgappe (paani-puri) were quite small in size and the salty-sweet water lacked much taste. Overall, worth a visit."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Went here as a group with my family and really enjoyed the food and kulfis. The customer service could improve though."}
{"text":"Butter chicken, butter chicken, butter chicken. That is all i'm going to say. I thought it was great! Definitely one of the best. My only pet peeve? Ginger. There were a few pieces that I really didn't like. And one more thing that I didn't like was the service. We spoke to 3 different people and we didn't get our change from our bill? We had to ask for it? Hmmm. That was quite a big tip for someone that didn't do anything except bring us the food?"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE AUDITED BY HEALTH  DEPARTMENT! DISGUSTING!!

Although the food is not too bad. This place is disgusting. They don't even care how dirty it is. I don't even wanna know how the food is prepared behind closed doors. Saw a clean spoon fall on the dirty floor and a waiter picks it up and chucks it back along with all the other \"clean\" utensils. I will never come here ever again. Service is not very welcoming either. Floors were dirty and stinky. When they wipe the tables they let everything fall on the floor. 
I would like someone from health department to audit this place. I guarantee they will not meet the standard qualifications and will be shut down immediately!"}
{"text":"Prices are decent, thali is good. Channa bhatura is always a winner. Veg items taste better than meat items here."}
{"text":"An Indian friend of mine told me about this place, so, I decided to make a luncheon visit to check it out. Having dined around Kolkata, and elsewhere in West Bengal, I know a thing or two about authentic East Indian cuisine.

More than a little out of the way in the G.T.A., nowhere near the downtown. The place is run like a no nonsense canteen, where one orders their dishes at the counter, it is plonked onto a tray for you, a little bit of this or that, take your tray and find an available table. Nothing fancy here, just, good everyday home-cooked East Indian food. Waitstaff were pretty much nonexistent during our meal, not too friendly, just like restaurants of this kind in India. Authentic all around!

P.S.: I seem to remember there's no beer or wine available; not sure if you can B.Y.O.W. or not. Best to call and ask."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Never going back!! $32 for two veg thali and 4 besan laddoos is too much. Moreover the taste of food is really worst! I don't know for what they are charging this much? Had so much expectations after seeing the reviews and photos. There are so many places where the veg thali is yummy and is not expensive like disgusting place!

Why are they selling sweets? Gajar halwa and gulab jamun is yuck! I was expecting that they'll have some exceptional curries because they're \"famous\" but it turns out that the vegetarian options are very common which you can get somewhere else which will definitely be tasty and is reasonable! Anyways I took Chola, Methi malai matar and brinjal curry as options in my veg thali and I ordered this as takeout... when I came home and started eating, turns out all the curry is not eatable because of the taste. Now I've tried worlds worst Chola, Methi malai matar and brinjal curry! 

Seriously people if you are making money then at least learn how to cook!

I was thinking to go there on our special day but Thank god I didn't otherwise they'd definitely ruin our day!"}
{"text":"Samosa Chole is delicious - DEFINITE A MUST! I guess all kinds of chat will be great.
Chole batura was good too( obviously oily because batura is deep fried)
Other than that we tried chicken biryani and chicken  afghani. Both were disappointing. Biryani had only chicken breast which made it very dry. Chicken Afghani had no flavor. 
It was more like tomato puree with lots of garam masala.
Staff is decent."}
{"text":"We had a family coming in from Vegas and wanted a good indian restaurant so we decided to go to Kwality since it was closer to the airport, about 5-10mins away. So once our family arrived we decided to grab their chaat papri which is crunchy chips with chutney yogurt and chickpeas, it was devoured quickly. Then we grabbed their chana bhatura which is \"their thing\" and grabbed 4 taali's ( you choose any 3 veggie with your choice of traditional indian dessert) it comes with rice and small salad. You order your naan bread or roti on the side. Also, we grabbed butterchicken on the side. Everything was exceptional and we were all so full with leftovers. The atmosphere is friendly and spacious. Need a good indian food place, check this place out in Brampton."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Ontario. Do yourself a favour and give this place a try. Highly recommend it.

My favourite dish is the butter chicken. If I get it as a take out, I usually also order a medium rice. If I eat it, I usually get a rice and a naan. I love to drench the rice in the sauce of the butter chicken - there's nothing better. 

All the food is fresh and the service is very professional. The ambiance better represent the sweets than it does the restaurant side. The prices are reasonable ($15 for butter chicken and rice for takeout and approximately $50 for a dinner for two). 

I work very close to this place and I'm usually there a couple of times a week for lunch. 

9.5 overall food rating."}
{"text":"This is my Indian husbands go to place for channa bhatura. I enjoy all their dishes. Yes the service from the middle aged Indian men is not stellar but your order is always right and quickly brought to your table.  Very large thali and serving sizes. Tandoori rôtis are just as awesome as their naan and we always leave STUFFED. No calorie or carb counting here!!"}
{"text":"I was hosting a family gathering over the weekend and my family and I were deciding to get catering done. We were told about this restaurant through friends. 

So we decided that we were going to get 3 plates which comes with 3 Sabzis'(veggies), 1 Rice, 1 Sweet & Salad. We ordered one of each veggie option. As we got home with the order, the food was terrible. It was so bland and the naan seemed like it was plastic wasn't even able to rip it apart. My parents complained about the fact we just spent $50 and didn't even get some decent food.

The dessert was the only thing from the plate that tasted good. I would go back for the dessert but never for the food. They need to get another cook or something..."}
{"text":"I can only review their take out option as I've never had a sit down experience here. 
They have a very large collection of very authentic indian dishes (both hot and cold options) and it should be your first option if you're thinking of bringing something like samosa's or pakora's to a dinner party/potluck etc.

I made an order for 60 samosas and it only came out to a final cost of $33 (including 2 different dipping sauces!) ! So most definitely worth your money. In previous occasions where I've walked in to get some stuff, they've provided a complimentary box of gulab jamun. 

This is a place that I see a lot of Indians come for take out as well, so it must be a big hit in their community as well which says a lot about authenticity. 

Check out their menu online it's got everything there with prices."}
{"text":"Of course I ended up here on a whim all over again today while in B-Town to run errands. Only to explore my taste buds outside the channa bathure realm, I gave the chicken sheekh kebab a try (they also have goat sheekh kebab as an alternative). It was juicy, and very moist with well marinated spices GOOD STUFF. 

In other news, my adventurism (is that a word?) made me try the mango kulfi all on its own, compared to my last visit when I had the kulfi falooda. IMHO, get the kulfi on it's own without the falooda part. On a beautiful Spring day, this was the perfect accompaniment to ending my meal. GOOD STUFF."}
{"text":"Food tasted good, but the prices are too high.  naan is sold seaprately at $2.50 for 2 pieces.

I've been to other Indian places with the same quality but lower prices.  Hence 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Called this morning to get the timing and the lady told me 10:30. We come at 9:30 and the extremely rude waitress gives us attitude about ordering immediately if we want to be served (literally before we could open the menu we were asked what we wanted). Half the menu items were unavailable and they apparently can't count because there wasn't enough water or spoons brought out. We quite literally only stayed because nothing else was open and it was a holiday. Complained to the manager which clearly landed on deaf ears. I told him his staff member told me they were open until 10:30 and his response was that 45 people work there so he can't make sure everyone is doing their job well. Knowing hours of operation seems pretty basic and not doing your job well. I don't typically wrote negative reviews but this horrible service compelled me. My family and my boyfriend family have been coming here for years because the food is pretty good (although there's much better available now) but this is my last time. Not worth eating somewhere where you are treated like they're doing you a favour by serving you - it's a business. Train your staff on basic manners and at least make sure people answering your phones know hours of operation."}
{"text":"This is the one and only place I will go to for authentic Indian food! I started off with the traditional \"safe\" stuff, such as the Samosa's and Butter Chicken, and eventually began diving into the rest of the menu. But no matter what I have tried, I have not been disappointed.

The samosas are gigantic, for starters. I always thought samosas to be small little things that fit in the palm of your hand, and consist of more dough than filling... but not at Kwality. For under a dollar each, you get a massive softball-sized samosa that is just packed full with incredible tasting ingredients. Even just two of these would be enough to fill your stomach.

Their Channa is also second to none! They recently had a contest for customers for a chance to win Free Channa Bhatura for a YEAR, and I tried so desperately hard to win it! Unfortunately, I did not, which is cool because you never mind paying for something that tastes so good!

Their Dosa selection is something that separates Kwality from most other Indian restaurants. Their Amritsari Dosa and Masala Dosa are my two go-to dishes, and it simply does not get any better than this.

The sweets counter is something that gives me trouble walking by without buying 2 pounds of treats. I usually grab a box of 5 or 6 of my favourites before walking out.

They also have an impressive display of cakes and pastries, and although I haven't tried any myself, my son absolutely loves their cupcakes."}
{"text":"This place initially started to be well known in our group for its mithai (sweets) that the people of Indian subcontinent would either have it on occasions or would take a pack of sweets for the host. 

Initially the food here was spicy to the Indian level and as many in the family couldn't handle the dishes, we stopped. 

We were on our way home from an event and thought of giving it a try. Ordered a Veggie Thali and an order of Chole Bature (chickpea curry with two deep fried bread (batures) and Vegetarian Fried Rice and this was the only dish the server said I can assure will not have dairy (butter, mainly). The order was prompt and service by the server was quick. He was very knowledgeable about the dishes. We requested the Fried Rice to be made with minimal of oil. 

The curries were noticeably less spicy than before and were to the mark. The quantity was more than plenty. The cost ($12) for Veggie Thali although noticeably higher than perhaps anywhere in Brampton. The Chole perfect and bature were perfectly fried. 

The Fried Rice was ordered with less oil and did come as requested. The quantity of vegetables in rice was less to our liking."}
{"text":"Happen to come to this place with a friend and I was happy that we came here. It was a weekend evening, pretty packed and busy but the co-ordinater handled the customers and seating situation really well. Even though it was pretty busy, but not even once were we made aware that the customer service part was being side lined. Enjoyed the food, nice authentic Indian food, good quantity and fast service. The paan store adjacent to the main eating area is pretty good as well. Very clean,offers Good sized paan and other hot and cold beverages. Overall a nice experience. Will surely visit again"}
{"text":"Its alright... Definitely gets crowded...and server did forget about my drink.... I would rather do buffets.."}
{"text":"I have never ordered food at Kwality, but today I bought about 3 lbs of their premium quality sweets. Priced at $12/lb, one would expect the best in Toronto because no other places sell sweet at this rate. And coming from Calcutta, India, sweets are almost in my genes so my taste buds are damn effective. I tried individual pieces of all their offerings.
There was nothing in there that justified the price. I will never go back to Kwality to buy sweets. Good that I did not end up losing more than the $36 I spent today. Easily other restaurants in Brampton, Etobicoke and Mississauga make sweets that are ten times better than Kwality.

Please avoid when buying sweets"}
{"text":"It's good wholesome food time after another. Veg or non veg. Can't go wrong with kwality. Whenever I don't want to take a chance and try something new kwality is my first choice. 

It used to be Brar's but they are no more the same Brar's they used to be."}
{"text":"Love there breakfast. Food is fresh and amazing. Staff friendly. Sweet both Indian and Continental are good."}
{"text":"I have a bit of a mixed review as I stopped in her to get lunch after all the ads on the radio.  I did not mind the 2 things I got which was the Chana Batista and eggplant curry.  The spice was something tolerable as most others in Brampton make food to hot.  The one thing I did not like was that there were no prices posted.  So I ended up paying $9.50 for Chana Batura. Which according to Zomato is $4.50.  I don't like deception and really think prices should be posted. I knew $9.50 was expensive so I thought the portion size to XL."}
{"text":"Great take-out option. Nan was chewy goodness. Way too much salt. Location is sketchy as Brampton is very industrial around there."}
{"text":"I really enjoy good Indian food, ands at this place there is a nice selection. Every time I am in the area I eat here and I have never gotten the same thing. 

The food is very authentic and quite tasty. They have a nice variety from the different regions of India. The prices and curly is great, not overly spice just right for the Canadian palate. There is a nice variety of fruit drinks that I have come to enjoy. The one thing I always get time I am here is the garlic naan, which is so tasty! Everything seemed to be very reasonably priced so we can get several dishes to try and not break the bank. 

The staff are friendly and courteous as they take your order plus they are willing to translate and explain the menu. Our last server offered us some suggestions which turned out to be a great deal! 

The baked treats are my favourite I am determined to try them all! I have not yet but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The interior of the shop gave a grand impression. The dramatic recessed ceiling had cornices decadently embellished matching the wallpaper and built out indirect lighting. Unfortunately the surrounding ceiling was T-bar and lit with fluorescent lights. Fans were hung regularly along the interior glazing. A few TVs mounted around the restaurant with Indian programming.

There was a restaurant seating area At the front and dessert display/fast food like serving area at the back. 
There were many beautiful dessert to buy and the wall behind showed all of the beautiful boxes to put them in. The banquettes in the seating area weren't very sturdy and the seats were easily movable. 

Service was not impressive. There was only one other pair of customers dining in when my sister and I entered but closer to lunch a few more groups arrived but the restaurant wasn't packed. The host/server was inattentive but met minimal needs. The time it took to get the food to the table was not bad although considering that most items were ready to serve in hot wells, I would have expected better. The dessert; meant to be served after the main dishes, did not come until we had to ask about it long after finishing. 

My sister and I ordered the following:

Thali $9.00 
3 vegetarian dishes with rice, raita, salad, achar, dessert & choice of naan rice or roti.
I chose Spinach & cheese, channa masala, malai kofta, gulab jaamun.
The well worn menu was pretty vague and didn't specify the choices of vegetarian dishes. The take out menu however did. I was surprised I needed to go to the fast food serving area to choose the vegetarian sides and dessert. Not really knowing any of the dishes, I chose familiar things like spinach & cheese and chickpeas.
The channa masala was spicy with a nice texture but not very vibrant.The malai kofta balanced the spiciness of the chickpeas. It was dissappointing that there was only sauce and 1 ball. Spinach and cheese was pretty heavy and dull in flavour. The dhai was slightly sour with crunchy pieces in it. I really liked the gulab Jamun. Made me think of donut soaked in syrup. The syrup itself is pretty sweet though.
Butter Chicken $12.50
Boneless pieces of chicken in creamy butter tomato sauce. This only came with a dish of this item. I am surprised it didn't come with anything like Naan bread to dip. There were a few pieces of meat too.  
Naan $3.00
This was the best part of the meal. It looked really fresh; the skin was glistening, it was hot & crunchy.  
Rusmalai $3.50
Cottage cheese balls soaked in sweetened cream. At this point, my sister and I were too full to eat this in one sitting. Tasting it at home, I love the cottage cheese with the syrup. The syrup itself though was pretty sweet.

 In the end the food was pretty good. I ended up leaving leftovers on the tray because I was so full. Compared to other places, I don't think this place is the best.

We also took some desserts home with us. The most notable detail was that all of the sweets were too sweet for my liking. The Jalebi had this mechanical after taste. I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"The first impression of the restaurant and the staff was poor. Tried asking a waitor where is the waiting line or whom should I ask for table for 2 and he dint bother replyong because he was busy looking for tip in the bills... and one of the bills was thrown over the food counter, fell in one of the currys n nobody cared! 

Foodwise it was ok not that great. ($8 bhatura was not worth the price seeing how clean they are!)

If you are somebody keen on cleanliness, wouldn't recommend it, and if you are somebody who likes food and can close eyes towards cleanliness, go ahead give it a try (not sure how overall it would taste)!"}
{"text":"My BF's family wanted to take me out for my 30th birthday. They all are from India and live in Brampton - I wanted an authentic experience with my peeps!!

We decided on Kwality Sweets as they are very familiar with this place. I really enjoyed having all of the dishes on the menu explained to my by my extended family, I defer to them as they are the experts on this type of cuisine ;)

I ordered paneer pakora as my starter. The best way to describe this is like deep fried mild cheese, served with a spicy sweet sauce. This is one of my very favourite Indian fast foods, I just love it and could eat this all of the time!

We also enjoyed gol cuppe, which are little fried puffs that you stuff with a mixture of chick peas and potatoes, dunk into very spicy water, then pop into your mouth for a flavour explosion! So so so yummy!!!

We ordered a tandoor mixed grill for the table with Afghan and Haralyi chicken, and a goat kabob. The meats were super flavourful and tender.

For my main I selected a thali, which is a platter of veggie dishes that you select yourself which comes with rice, salad, dhai (yogurt) and a sweet of your choosing. I chose the aloo gobi (potato cauliflower curry), mutter paneer (cheese and peas in gravy), and the galab jamun (round little sweet ball). It was all very tasty and fresh, I just loved it!

My BF ordered an amazing dosa, which comes with various dips, including an amazing coconut chutney - very tasty! I liked how you can actually watch the dosa chef making the dishes in the restaurant, lots of talent that man had!

To wash it all down, I ordered a special Indian coffee which my BF's mom recommended (not sure of the name but try to order it when you are here - so good!).

You can even order sweets by the pound or ice cream on your way out!

Overall, a very busy place but great to try if you are new to Indian food or have been enjoying it for years!"}
{"text":"I tried almost all the Indian restaurant in GTA Toronto, but the place's food is so good, economical, and service is also nice. So 4 stars for all."}
{"text":"Kwality seems like an entirely random experience in Toronto. Every time I'm back here it feels like I'm actually somewhere in Punjab, India. This place is riddled with Fobs. So much so that it's a pretty fun experience. Actually, scratch that, come here in preparation for a trip to India. You'll see what I mean when you're back from your flight. 

This restaurant has been renovated in the last two years, and although they lost the personal touch, since they're busier than ever, I believe the food is pretty much the same. Don't expect much in terms of service because the wait staff is always thin, but it's a clean, large space for a group of people. 

I won't recommend the thali, but I'm pretty indifferent to it if you're starving, just beware that it's probably not the healthiest. If you're a meat-eater I recommend the Tandoori Thali and a couple of naan. It's good enough for 2-3 people."}
{"text":"Pricing has jumped a lot in last 1 year may be due to LCBO license .
Good is good though but not worth the price .
Chanda Bhatura rocks here !"}
{"text":"Best place to have indian food in brampton. There is no comparison to this place . If u wanna have real authentic indian food with proper species grease and taste, your search is over. Dont forget to order their garlic masala dosa , Amazing.."}
{"text":"i go here for one thing and one thing only - channa bhatura. Its THE BEST you will find in all of North America hands down! I've actually taken my out of town guests here from India and even they attested to it - this is pretty much as good as it gets even in Delhi.

That being said, a couple of pointers
* do not bother sitting down for table service, its pretty much non existent. One time we tried, waited for 10 minutes, and eventually ended up getting take out instead.
* rush past the initial crowd thats mostly in awe staring at the sweets in the glass display cases - head straight for the cashier and place your order ASAP

oh, and bring it home and enjoy every bite...mmmmm..yes..its that good."}
{"text":"Update on my review now that I've tried the table service side. We came in late on a Tuesday and the scene was much calmer than our last visit. Service was good and fast, and food was delicious. We got a thali, mixed paratha (served with pickle and butter and we got a small raita on the side), pista kulfi, and a masala chai. All were very good and tasty. I wish there was a Kwality downtown, I think they'd do very well."}
{"text":"It use to be really good. But this time the food and services was terrible. We ordered few items from the menu, and all of them tasted bad. I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for about 15 years or more. Always fantastic food, good fair prices. The cleanliness is top notch incl the bathrooms. The presentation of the restaurant itself is clean cut. 

The food itself has remained consistent over the years. That's fantastic. The breakfast channa bhatura is a trend with my brother to have each time we bring our car to get serviced down the street. 

The mango lassi wasn't as great as I'd like it to be but the food in general is fresh and delicious. The ice cream extension that open now has a absolute delicious selection of Indian frozen treats. I esp love the multi layered kulfi!! 

I've yet to find a better Indian restaurant around town anywhere. Votes up!"}
{"text":"The last time I went to this place was close to 10 years ago (and after my most recent visit, I remembered why). I had the Chicken Tikka Masala; one of my go-to's wherever I go. Having said that, I know what to expect when I have this dish and having it here was far from what I expected. The dish lacked any sort of resemblance  to a traditional Chicken Tikka Masala dish, and instead boasted a heavy tomato purée taste, something more along the lines of a cheap cop out way of making it.

Food aside the restaurant is relatively clean inside, which ill admit is a nice chance from other Indian restaurants I've been to. Service too is good, I couldn't really find anything to complain about our server. One thing I can say though is that they don't acknowledge the Yelp check-in coupon for a free drink (please, ask me how I know)."}
{"text":"Go for the Channa Bhatura and must try the rahra Gosht ( Goat).  Really good. Gajar Halwa was really goood"}
{"text":"Great food, but poor service. Also, would recommend they hire more people to help clean. Would definitely order the chili chicken, grilled meat platter and fish tikka."}
{"text":"The prices have gone up recently being a regular here.
The chana bhatura is really good here.
The service is pretty decent as the staff is very prompt with the orders.
Their BBQ items are not the best because there is always some redness in their meat.
Their Mango Lassi is totally out of this world as it's something that tastes so different than any other place I may have tried before.
They have expanded and now focus on snack foods and sweets as well as it attracts another genre of people."}
{"text":"My friend in Canada kept raving about this place and the Channa Bhatura here.  So much so that I couldn't wait to try it out.

We reached here at 9:30 PM and were told to order quickly as they were closing the kitchen in 30 minutes.

We ordered the following:
- Channa Bhatura: DELICIOUS!!! They don't give enough Chana with the two huge Bhaturas.  Simply delish.

- Chaat Papri: average, nothing great.
- Paani Puri: spicy  and flavorful.
- Malai Kulfi: Perfect way to end the night.  This kulfi reminded me of the kulfi I used to have in Punjab during my summer vacation when I was a kid.  It totally took me back to my childhood.  They have the kulfi in different flavors, but I always go for the Malai Kufi.

I would recommend wearing something comfortable as you will definitely over-eat and loose-clothing will help :)

The ambiance is not that great, more of a dhaba experience.  The service was decent.  Overall, great food that resulted in food coma.  Definitely worth dining here."}
{"text":"In order for me to give a good review, I look for the following things:  freshness/taste, cleanliness, and of course, good price point.  With their most expensive items on the menu being ~$10/$11, Kwality meets all of those qualifications!

Hostess, lady behind the sweets counter were both patient and nice when our order took longer than someone who's a regular.  During the meal, hostess even checked up on us, asking how everything was, etc.

We ordered 2 \"lighter\", app/veg items for dinner:  Channa Batura ($5.50) and Chaat Papri ($4.50). Turns out that both weren't very light at all, but quite filling, enough for dinner serving, that's for sure!  

(I love Indian food, but in general, I find it quite heavy, so I don't eat it often.)

Batura, fried bread, was delicious, and even though dish came with 2 pieces, 1 was more than enough for me.  Channa (chickpeas) were nicely seasoned.  With the exception of the pickled/salted mango, the other pickles were nice.

Chaat Papri was quite saucy, a bit on the sweeter side, but tasty.  Not sure if I'd be able to eat it on my own.  Good value though.

The only minus points was for the setting.  Seating was \"closed off\" from ordering counter and another dining area.  Kitchen was closed off as well as station that stated it was for Masala Tea.  I like open spaces more.  Actual restaurant looks larger from the outside.

I also ordered a Chai that never came, but I was charged for.  I told the staff and they were prompt to remove it from the bill."}
{"text":"Great place for a quickie meal. Be it a meat kebab wrap, a full-out multiple casserole tray or dessert. Service was quite prompt and very curteous."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place.  Food is consistent - I have always loved Punjabi food.  The service - just remember not to take anything personally!

However, the lady who was keeping an eye on things and the man at the cash register were polite.

The masala dosa was thin, crispy, hardly any visible oil to speak of any very tasty.  The accompanying coconut sauce, eggplant curry and rasam soup were very good.  Not dripping in oil.

I had the fish tikka.  FABULOUS.  Dry (which I like) and well-marinated.

Now, the piece de resistance:  THE SWEET COUNTER IS OUT OF BOUNDS!  Lots of different barfi (coconut, caju, pista, and of course gulab jamuns) ... and jalebis ...

Have not been there for a long time.  Service is the same (not with a  smile but the food very consistent)."}
{"text":"Great for take out.  Good price hearty food.

Kebabs were a bit dry, vindaloo was honest and true to tradition, saag is just like naani-ma used to make."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I'm no stranger to Indian food. Despite not having a trace of South-Asian DNA in me, I love their food. I've tried Indian food in almost every city I've visited and know good stuff when I taste it. After leaving work near the airport I saw my drive home was going to take an hour instead of the usual 25 minutes. I decided I had to find a way to kill an hour. That's when I started driving north on Airport Road and figured I'd try to find Kwality Sweets as I had heard lots about them. 

Upon arriving I wasn't sure if I had to order at the counter or not. Nobody acknowledged me for almost 5 minutes while I looked over the offerings. Finally, I took a seat and at last a waiter came over to see if I needed something....yeah I'm looking to eat? Strange concept eh. As usual for a new Indian place I decided to try their vegetarian thali platter. Kwality does the standard thali including three curries, rice, salad, carrot pickle (achar), raita, dessert and your choice of bread. I went with the eggplant (bhangan), malai kofta (veggie ball in a creamy tomato curry), and palak paneer (spinach with cubed Indian cheese). I also choice the roti as I find naan to be too thick for a large meal. While I waited, I observed the dining area. It was probably 40% full with only South Asian customers. I noticed the floors were dirty with dropped food/naan crumbs which was very obvious. No attempt was made to clean it up despite the staff not being overly busy with tables. Once my food arrived I noticed the portion was quite good for the $11 price tag. They gave me two pieces of plain roti which were slightly larger and thicker than I have had elsewhere. Starting with the eggplant, I found it be tasty but a bit on the salty side. The malai kofta gravy was mild and creamy with the veggie ball being rather sweet. It had a slight \"gulab jamun\" type of taste. For those unaware, a gulab jamun is an Indian sweet consisting of a milk-based dough-ball soaked in sugary syrup. It's very rich and sweet. Lastly, the palak paneer was probably my least favorite. It had a very odd taste to it. I suspect the spinach was previously frozen if I had to guess. The accompanying salad/raita/rice/carrot pickle and my choice of a gulab jamun for dessert were pretty standard, no complaints there. None of my choices were that spicy which was surprising but I guess they're trying to cater to a varied spice-tolerance. 

While I can't say the food was horrible, it wasn't anything special and certainly not as good as I expected considering Kwality is seen as one of the better take-out places based on what I've heard. Unfortunately, I have to agree with many reviews about the service being sub-par. While it may have been because I was the only non-Indian person in the restaurant I felt like the staff were not very attentive. Even small things like keeping the floor clean seemed to be missed and making the eating area look sloppy."}
{"text":"Stopped into Kwality today to grab some samosas for a work event. Having never been there, and with no prices on the digital menu, I asked about the cost of samosa. A steep 0.75$ each. Back in my area they are 3 for $1. I balked at the price, but was committed to bringing samosas, so just accepted it.

Honestly, I snuck a few just now and they are so delish! Very fresh, not overly greasy and totally massive! They are easily 1.5 times the size of a normal samosa. If not double some places. While I am not excited about the cost, I would say they seem worth it. Just get your cheaper samosas for work luncheons somewhere else and enjoy these babies for yourself."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic Chole Bature!!! Had this serious craving and looked up on Yelp for places that serves this dish. This is by the best I have found in the entire North American region where the taste comes close to home (Delhi)."}
{"text":"One thing that brought us here was Channa Bhatura (was recommended by a local).  It is located on a shopping plaza in Brampton.  The ambiance does have a sweet shop look to it with quick dining experience.

Food does come out very quick and most of it is very fresh.
* Channa Bhatura was a HIT and we ended up ordering an extra.  The bhatura (bread) is huge and one can definitely be shared among two people.
* Paani Puri - the water that came with it was spicy.  Recommend putting some tamrind chutney to neutralize the spicy level.
* Chaat Papri - was average but did have home made masala feel to it.
* Shahi Paneer - the gravy was good and paneer average.
* Onion Kulcha - was fresh and well prepared with not a lot of ghee (oil).
* Malai Kulfi - comes on a stick and delicious desert to end the night.

The menu is large and you would want to try a lot of things.  I would recommend pacing your self and ordering as you need.

Customer Service was splendid. Even though we came in late and the place was about to shut down, they catered to us and never hurried us to leave."}
{"text":"I had to come in here earlier today, just for those samosas! They are so good. The vegetable ones by the way. I tried the butter chicken.. it wasn't bad, but I've had better.. I wouldn't order the chicken but the chili fish, I know is amazing. I'm sure the lamb, or other stuff here is probably good. I gave it 3 stars today simply because of the butter chicken not being that great. I will keep coming here, I really like the samosas, lol"}
{"text":"Kwality has become my favourite Indian restaurant right now. The quality and quantity for the price is definitely worth it. My staple has now become the idli (they serve 3 huge idlli's) which are perfectly cooked and are the best I've had, and also their tandoori chicken which are cooked fresh per order. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I never been to Punjab, India. I don't know what is authentic Punjabi cuisine supposed to taste like. But I can tell you after eating here at Kwality Sweets & Restaurants.. I am in love with

Bhatura!! Of course now I know they are deep fried made with ghee. They are just so good and I love how they puffed up when they were served as I know they were just so fresh!

We shared Channa Masala ($4.50), Karahi Goat ($10), Samosa ($3.50), Garlic Naan ($3.50) and washed them down with Salt/Mango Lassi. They were all delicious and well spiced.

Stuffed and Happy. But I can still eat more Deep Fried Bread!

Service here is A-OK. Our waitress was patience and helpful, She even dropped off extra napkins for us without me asking...maybe I just look like a messy eater!"}
{"text":"Food is really good but service was weird. Could tell some of the waiters were new as they didn't know what they were doing. Honestly felt kinda bad for them. But I think eventually they will hang of it. Chaana butra was amazing (but you don't get raitha with it) and the curry for the shai paneer and malai kofta were good but the paneer itself was not that great. Brampton has a load of awful indian restaurants but this is one of the best ones."}
{"text":"Another awesome Indian food place in Toronto. Very reasonable prices, excellent selection of snacks, food, sweets and desserts. Good seating space, fast enough service. The batura which every one keeps raving about was actually too oily for my taste. Chole was good and so was the Indian chai."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The food portions are really good and more than enough. I enjoyed my veggie thali. The naan was very fresh and a generous portion size. The palak paneer, shahi paneer and raita were just perfect. I also very much enjoyed the gajar ka halwa. Very tasty. My fiancé enjoyed his kulcha as well. (Its a nice place inside but the floors had so many dirty tissues and straws on the ground leading to the table and under the table we sat at which was a turn off). But overall great food!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice to eat in and did take out once. The food is amazing, but the service is not that great. They are pretty slow, servers take too long to answer your questions as if they don't really know the answer or have to check a lot. But I keep going because the food is great. Try the Cheese Masala Dosa. It is HUGE and filling and super yummy!"}
{"text":"One recommendation....come here hungry!!  This place is like heaven on earth for Punjabis!!  Everything and I mean everything was muy delicioso.  Oh wait, another recommendation; come here with a large group and share!!  You get to sample a variety of dishes which is great because they offer such a wide selection. 

When I walked in my eyes were immediately fixed on the mithai(sweets) and homemade  kulfi(Indian ice cream).  Mithai in the shapes of apples and pineapple upside down cake...yumm!  We ordered quite a few items from their vegetarian menu; starting off with pani puri, aloo tikki, and chaat papdi.  For our main dishes we ordered chana bhatura and thali plate which included bhindi masala, kadhi, and matar paneer.  We also had gobi parantha(cauliflower stuffed flatbread), aloo parantha (potato stuffed flatbread), and roti.  The paranthas were accompanied by achar(pickle) and way way too much butter than one can handle.

We packed kachoris and mithai to go so I could savor them at home in the Bay!  I was disappointed to find out they were out of kulfi.  They should definitely stock up on kulfi especially for those hot days in Ontario.  Oh well, that just gives me another reason to make another trip here! :-)"}
{"text":"excellent samosas 
never tried anything else"}
{"text":"Was totally impressed with the decor. The servers I found out to be pretty decent, not grumpy faced as had been commented by some yelpers. The chana batura that we ordered were awesome. I would certainly be back there to try the kulfi faluda and the kababs... Amritsari kulchas are equally tasty"}
{"text":"Coming here from years now. It's greasy but is delicious. prices as fair, service is fast."}
{"text":"I am a foodie & have stayed in Punjab for over 4 years with some fantastic eating experiences - sannewaal ka dhaba, amritsari phirni etc.

The good things first: clean, relatively less waiting time & brisk, bordering on indifference, service.

Many good reviews mainly from non Indians but also Indians had raised my expectations about this place in Brampton. 

We ordered less but everything was bad to just about average.

1) Amritsari kulcha & channa

Channa was above average to good - spicy & thick gravy with good quality channa but kulcha left a lot to be desired- not enough stuffing & lacking the aahh! thing.

2)Kheema naan - goat was ATROCIOUS, artificial red colored over spiced tasteless meat. 

3)Tandoor platter - fish, goat meat kabab & paneer tikka.

Fish tikka was average but kebabs were pathetic - colored granular meat that was tasteless.

The last nail in the coffin was paneer tikka . A supposedly trademark dish was screwed up so badly - bad quality paneer over-grilled, dry & tasteless.

Lastly the sweet paan although customized by excluding some ingredients again was botched up & not at all like a paan.

Most of what we ordered was not eaten & left- please see snaps. Maybe I should not be so harsh from only one  visit but I am not going back to this place again.

Banjaara & Trimurti are 2 Indian restaurants that serve quite a decent goat preparations."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise.

Great \"kwality\" for the price.

Good family atmosphere ... even a good place to have marsala tea, chat and watch the latest Bollywood on a big screen. 

Servers were very good and patient at explaining the menu and food options.

Love the gift boxes that Kwality uses to pack your sweets - something I would have expected in Swizterland, Japan or Korea but not here."}
