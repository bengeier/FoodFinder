{"text":"Big Mouth Kee is awesome! They serve up traditional Cantonese foods that come in large portions that can be shared among many people. Everything is made soooo very delicious, especially the whole lobster (they are HUGE and meaty - sooo good!!) picked fresh and saut√©ed in ginger and green onion (way better than the ones in Chinatown!). My family was quite impressed with both the authenticity and quality of the food, as well as the fact that it was pretty cheap. I will most certainly be back here during the winter time as they are very famous for their Winter Melon Soup (served only during the winter season) which is actually cooked and handed out in the melon itself so it's quite interesting! It's both tasty and healthy for you and will warm you up during the coldest time of year!  Big Mouth Kee is consistently the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to - if only it wasn't such a far and long drive......"}
{"text":"4 out of 5 times, this place makes one of the best sweet and sour pork dish.  Unfortunately, tonight  was not one of the 4.  A good sweet and sour pork dish is when the sauce does not coat the plate.  It is bit hard to explain, but if you watch a lot of those Chinese cooking adventure shows, you will understand what i am trying to describe.  

They also make very good lobsters as well.  Is about $16 per pound and unlike other places, when you order a 5lb one, you actually do get all of the pieces.

The fried rice dishes are fried very well cooked too.  I like them dry and if the rice are individually separated,  you know it is good stuff. 

They usually start you off with a complimentary soup with a side of the meat that was cooked in the brooth (yummy) and end the meal with a warm bowl of tofu fa.  

Price wise, not bad at all.  

Will i come back... yes.  Have been coming here for the last 10 years i think.  This restaurant has been very consistent thought out."}
{"text":"In a city that has TONS of Chinese restaurants with talented chefs, how does one stand out? Simply being authentic isn't enough to compete, the food must be outstanding...and this place has outstanding food indeed! Now outstanding food does not just mean the food tasting great, it also goes beyond taste. With their retro, authentic decor and traditional dishes, this places elicits childhood memories I thought were long gone. This place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple times over the past few months - the food is pretty decent. Service is OK - typical Chinese. The place is a bit worn and can use a renovation, but I did not find it dirty.

Food was quite good - authentic Chinese. Quality of the dishes were all on par with more upscale restaurants.

Prices are reasonable too.

Worth a visit, it's one of the better places in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"It was ok. It was very late night and it served its purpose but it would not be place I would drive to to eat.  The food was ok had shrimp and eggplant in black bean sauce. Chicken fries rice was greasy.  Lemon chicken very boring. No eggs rolls but had spring rolls which tasted Burnt. Overall was not a place I would go again."}
{"text":"\"The one where we didn't know we were actually in a restaurant.\"

The Good:
Good portions; not that greasy; lunch menus are pretty good values (if you're not sharing); slightly above average quality

The Bad:
The decor made you feel like you were sitting in some outdoor side restaurant in China; gives you this \"dirty impression\"

Overview:
Big Mouth Kee. What does it mean? Well, it's literally a translation of the Chinese name \"Dai How Kee\". At first stepping inside you wouldn't know you might think twice that you were actually in a restaurant, if it weren't for the Street Fighter 2 arcade right by the door. The decor is definitely something that you'll remember: it's decorated such that it resembles an outdoor side restaurant from China, which didn't give the best impression...it actually looked somewhat dirty? We went for lunch and they gave us a lunch menu which had typical Richmond Hill business set lunches. I ended up getting a Shanghai Noodle (Shanghai Cho Chow) and my friends got Rice with Garoupa over rice and Sweet and Sour Pork. We decided to share. Overall, we really liked the Shanghai Noodles the most and found that to disappear the first. The others were OK, but the Shanghai noodles were probably the best out of the three. It was somewhat oily though, but not overly oily to the point where the bottom of bowl's drenched in a puddle. Each of the business lunches came with a drink which is pretty standard. Nothing special about the drinks, just your typical HK Style drinks (i.e. Hong Kong Style Milk Tea, Ice Lemon Tea, etc.). Service was pretty standard with one waiter serving the entire restaurant during the lunch hours.

Not much to say really...it's your typical Chinese food restaurant with slightly above average quality. Lunch came out to about $8 tax in. Haven't been back again since then though, probably because there wasn't really anything that \"drew\" me to go back. In fact, it's probably the decor which really doesn't put it on my list of considerations when we're sitting in the car thinking about where to go. Also, it's probably because for $8 tax in there are better places to get Chinese food in the Richmond Hill location (see my other reviews, more to come!). But if you don't mind the somewhat \"unique\" decorations, go ahead and give it a shot...it's a safe bet.

{"text":"Et tu BMK? Sad. Very sad state to find my beloved BMK - the penultimate late night North GTA dining destination - in such a state of neglect that I could barely believe that it was indeed the same place.  At the height of BMK's glory it was a sort of Disney-fied representation of Hong Kong street food; twice the clean - twice the price - 75% of the flavour. 

Today it has fallen so far its former glory that I actually walked outside and checked to make sure we were at BMK.  What it lacks in hygiene it makes up for in indifference.  

The food was never inspired, but it was a really nice classic Cantonese menu - mostly street food, but definitely fresh and tasty.  Now? Blech!  Little better than foodcourt Chinese.

So, why not 1 star?  Honestly, one of them is a pity star for so many great stories that start out with \"Remember that time at BMK when....\""}
{"text":"I often frequent this place with my family and consider it as \"comfort\" food. Here are the few things I love about this place:

- Their soup is truly a homestyle chinese soup with the remnants of the soup served in a separate plate for you to savour. 
- The wintermelon soup is hearty and filled with seafood and vegetables. It sells out quickly so it's best to call and reserve one in advance. 
- Their seafood prices are extremely reasonable. I once had an epic 7lb lobster with my family (!!!!!) It was only $9.99/lb.
- Free desserts! The good kinds too (I know, you're probably thinking *sigh not red bean soup again =P) They usually have \"tofu fa\", mung bean sago or coconut black glutinous rice dessert. 

The decor restaurant is filled with old school Hong Kong billboards, fish tanks and wooden chairs to mimic the outdoor street dining experience in HK. 

In all, this restaurant has been consistent with their quality of food and service for many years. It's nothing fancy but definitely a good place to visit for a laid back meal without breaking your wallet - that's unless you decide to order a 7lb lobster. =)"}
{"text":"Big Mouth Kee been here for ages but it is no longer the same place I remember it to be.  The decor is the same but that is about it.  The food is not the same as before and the place is super dirty now.  The unique decoration of the place is still cool making it look like we eating on the street. Sitting is uncomfortable but that is the style they are going for.  I still love the sizzling plate chow mein with chicken and the steamed oyster with black bean.  They have lots of seafood but it is hard to order cause they have a lot of specials written in Chinese all around the place.  The place is good if you want to eat after parties and club as it opens till 5am.  Big Mouth Kee is a shell of itself these days but it does bring back the fond memories.

{"text":"The food is average here. Nothing special or notable to mention. I ordered lobster from here and big mistake. I didn't like it. Not worth the $$$$. The only thing that's good is that you can have Chinese food in the wee hours of the morning. That's always fun. That's why this restaurant has been in business for all these years."}
{"text":"Access
Don't tell me you want to come here by public transportation? Even though VIVA has upgraded, your best bet is to drive but then parking will be another problem. For those who are depending on google to take you here, please note it's on the lower level. A bit difficult to find but surely it shouldn't take too long.

Service
Not the best, took like 5 minutes for someone to even greet us. Anyhow you aren't looking to tip them a lot here, it is standard Asian service.

Food 
I am pretty sure they were better back in the days. The food is so-so but you really can't complain about its price. If you aren't really sure what to order, definitely go for the combos! We ordered the 6-person combo, where you can choose 4 entrees of your choice and you will get soup, chicken, steamed fish, and dessert as extras. This is honestly quite good, we had 7 people and each of us paid less than $15. Let me just say that everything is average, none of them stood out and to me the fish was their best dish. I really wish they had prepped the fish for us - for example cutting it open with sides separated (usually restaurants do that for you).

You really get what you paid for. It's great for those who want to come late at night because it opens until 2-3am."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I don't really remember coming here much as a kid, but definitely get that old vibe for this restaurant...

Came here for a large gathering of friends and family, but was definitely underwhelmed by most of the food. The decor is definitely interesting though. As a homage to old Hong Kong, they have street stalls and different elements of the culture from the 70s/80s on the walls and throughout the restaurant on display. Definitely a blast to the past, or what you'd see in movies or TV shows. 

Other than that, the food wasn't all that great. The soup and veggies were quite bland, with not much flavour at all. Could be a good sign in that they don't use a lot of MSG in their cooking? But the steamed fish was a bit off, and their fried rice was extremely fishy! I wouldn't even try it after catching a whiff of it. Fortunately, their chicken was decent flavour and quite tender despite the abundance of white meat, and the tofu dessert was pretty good. 

Service was also good, with attentive servers and quick service. Came to change our plates and check on our drinks often. However, this restaurant isn't exactly my cup of tea, so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere gives you the impression that you're eating at a outdoor food stand in Hong Kong but with air conditioning.  I thought the food was great, even though I didn't understand a lick of chinese from the menu.  FYI -  The Chinese and English menus are different.  I asked the waiter for some seafood suggestions - had an assortment of seafood and a fried noodle.  Damn good!"}
{"text":"The only times I've gone to this restaurant, and that's over a dozen times, are in the middle of night. The place stays open until 4AM (5AM on weekends). 

It is decorated to look like a Hong Kong Dai Pai Dong (open-air food stall), of which genre this restaurant belongs to. Over the years the wall murals and decor started looking more dirty than stylish, luckily food quality is maintained more or less. 

The bilingual menu is uninspiring - typical Cantonese dishes and congee/rice noodle/noodle/rice categories, with odd and \"funny\" English translation. But don't let that discourage you, ask the waiter to explain what's on the Chinese-only menu or ask for his recommendation, or simply look around at other tables and point. If you like seafood, check out what's in live tanks as they usually have a good selection of fish and shellfish. 

Some of the dishes I've tried:
+ stir fried Vancouver crabs in curry sauce (HK version curry i.e. mild) 
+ stir fried clam (or whatever shellfish) in black bean sauce 
+ Tong choy (Thai morning glory) in fermented bean sauce or shrimp-paste sauce 
+ Teow Chew style omelet with chopped up fresh oyster (English translation says \"Fried Oyster Cakes\", I wouldn't know) 
+ Jellyfish appetizer if you like Jellyfish (English menu says \"Preserved Sea Weeds\") 

The food deserves 3.5 stars; for being there at any oddly hours, I am bumping up to 4 stars.

Oh, don't go there if you are looking for spring roll, chicken balls, egg foo yong type of Chinese food.  You'd be disappointed there.  As a general rule, stay away from Chinese restaurants in Markham-Richmond Hill area becuase you'd be disappointed in most of these restaurants that cater to ethnic Chinese taste."}
{"text":"Late night eats and late night treats are always a plus in my books!  If you are craving some Fresh Lobster, Crab, or Eel after the bar has shut down then this is your go to place!  The service is quick, attentive, and personable.

The food is all fresh and tasty! I always order the sweet and sour pork, lobster, special fried rice, and chow mein and they are all super tasty especially after you finish a bottle or six of vodka with your friends a few hours before!

Make sure you park in the lower level so you can have easy access to the door.  Enjoy your late night eats and treats!"}
{"text":"Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking 
When I said I'd like to smash every tooth 
In your head

Now I know how Jennifer K felt

And her Wonton Soup started to melt

Bigmouth, la ... bigmouth, la ... 
Bigmouth strikes again 
And you've got no right to take place 
In the great Yelp race.

I'm a little saddened to see this once happening and super trendy restaurant du jours take a few steps back from it's glory days.  This was a place I automatically recommended to anyone in the area looking for affordable simulated street food.  But next thing you know, I realized I haven't been back in probably 5 years.  

There's just more options now.  More places.  Better Service.  More creative food.  This place isn't \"bad\" per se, just a little tired.  Kinda like a good wife after 30 years of marriage.  You still love her.. but dang.. it's been 30 years!"}
{"text":"Again I'm out later at night and one of the few places that are open.  From the exterior the place looks decent but the moment i walked in, i felt like i have been tricked.  The signs are all written on what seems to be wrinkled paper with a black marker.  I felt like i was in a dirty old school china town restaurant.  We waited for a little before we got steated.  What blew my mind was the waiter that came out with a purple uniform.   I think money spent in cleaning up and renos would be more worth while.

To my surprise the food is pretty decent.  I got Cantonese chow mien. Good portions.  Large pieces of squid.

I would give this place a better score if i didn't feel like i might get jumped by Chinese triads for doing a review while eating."}
{"text":"used to hit this place up all the time when i lived up town... HK style diner with a big selection of dishes.... open till 5am on the weekends! 

not sure if i would come here during regular dinning hours though.... lots of other good chinese restos around... i reserve this place for post 2am!"}
{"text":"You definitely get that old school HK vibe at Big Mouth Kee. For me though, I just wasn't feeling that ambiance. The food was all right but it was definitely on the greasy side. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"This use to be my go to place for eel but as of late its been getting worse in quality. The first time I came here I was blown away and I would throw out a 5 star. Decor is really cool. They have created a theme where it feels like you are eating out doors on the streets of an Asian county but its indoors of course. Fresh sea food and its evident with the large display of tanks in the back. Price is a bit high but it was good back then when they were serving quality seafood. The honey flavored fried eel was to die for. 

My latest visit was horrendous though. The eel was old and tough and the skin of the eel was like rubber. And on another occasion they ran out of the eel which I usually order so they recommended a different type which was smaller and steamed with black beans. Mental note: Never order this eel. It was so nasty. Even with these bad experiences I will still return hoping the eel with honey sauce will come back from the dead. 

PS I'm addicted to eating eel, just love the taste and texture. And if you look up on google the benefits of eating eel then you men out there would definitely be eating eel like no tomorrow."}
{"text":"I like this place!  It's open till 5 am, what's not to like?  the food is decent and the prices are reasonable.  Steamed oysters were huge and not overcooked which can get rubbery~  A-ok! See my pics!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One word to describe this place FILTHY!!!!!
I know they are trying to imitidate the HK style streets but common, the tables and chairs are sticky and dont get me started on the restrooms...Its your typical average chinese restaurant, nothing special about this place, only that it opens to the wee hours like 4 or 5am...prices arent too cheap and it seems like the portions are getting smaller"}
{"text":"Great Hong Kong style dishes, tasty and flavourful - especially fried food! Opens till 4am, never a rush to eat here. Staff are friendly. 
Complimentary soup and dessert, feel comfy every time I finished meals here.
I brought my relatives from UK there and they love it!
I keep going back after I tried it once."}
{"text":"Great late night hk style dishes.  I loved their clams with black bean sauce.   Tough to find a place opened late night in Richmond Hill so big mouth kee is one of my go to places."}
{"text":"This place has been around for more than 20 years, and has been a consistent place to visit for decently priced HK style dishes.  If you are looking for fancy presentation or great service, look else where, because this place really is just about good consistent (and cheap) food.  The interior is reminiscent of the restaurants you'll find in Hong Kong, with hand written items taped to the wall and a large fish tank at the back that holds all sorts of yummy seafood options.  In terms of the their dishes, I would say that their seafood is what they are really known for and I can attest that their lobster is indeed very good.  The rest of the menu is decent although nothing too stand out, and at times can be very oily (but that's really not that different from any other Chinese restaurant)."}
{"text":"I have been going to Big Mouth Kee for years! It used to be one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in the area because you can get decent food with good prices.

However, I have not been going there as often because with the better restaurants that has been popping up in the Richmond Hill area, Big Mouth Kee has not improved at all, in fact it is going downhill...

We went there for dinner on a Sunday evening. The place was not packed at all. We got seated quickly. Though the seats are not the comfy one, as  it tried to imitate the feel of food stalls back in Hong Kong.

There are so much choices in their menu! We decided on the Wonton Chicken Soup, Garlic with Beef and shredded duck with lettuce wrap.

I found everything so salty, so oily and full of MSG! The soup has so much oil floating on top and the beef was deep fried then stired fried! The lettuce that provide a few of them when turning colour!

The only thing I really enjoy was the free dessert: tofu pudding! Yes the tofu pudding saved the meals! At least it was not salty or oily and has no MSG!

There were a lot of tables ordering the fresh seafood from the water tank... BTW, a pound of Vancouver red shrimp cost $26! And all they did was steamed them and give you some chilli soy sauce!

I have to agreed with Reuben Z that this place is not really clean... is it how the street stalls suppose to be? :)

If I come back again, I will make sure I request less salt and less oil when I order my dishes.

They accepts Visa and Mastercard! No Debit!"}
{"text":"Came with friends who've been here before, albeit none of us are regulars.  Big Mouth Kee is located in Jubilee Square, under the Ambassador Chinese restaurant.  My first impression, looking through the windows, was that of a food court (its not).  After a better look inside, it seems they've decorated the place to resemble an outdoor food court with vendor stands on one wall, tables clustered beside them, big seafood tanks along another side, posters and food signs plastered or hanging everywhere.  While the tables and seats were clean enough, the rest does a good job making you feel like you're eating on the street (ie, not so clean).  Interesting look, even if I cynically think it makes cleaning easier.

We decided to ask our waiter for suggestions rather than pick through the extensive menu.  The real menu is also only in Chinese; the English one probably isn't going to get you to the foods worth eating.  Wait staff can be aggressive in pushing dishes, then MIA during the meal, but nothing I didn't expect.

Everything we ordered was per suggestion.
- Wintermelon soup: seems to be a house specialty.  We get part of a wintermelon shell propped up in a container, filled with wintermelon soup, seafood, duck skin and meat.  Its quite delicious, and plenty of seconds to be had, scooping out the melon from the shell to eat also.  Expensive too, at $48, but it served both dish and soup functions.

- Steamed fresh shrimps: $26/pound.  Not the routine stuff, these were big, brightly colored shrimps with healthy hard shells.  After peeling them out, the meat was super fresh with rich shrimp flavor.  Head meat was fantastic.

- Stewed oxtail: falling off the bone tender, in a casserole that was rich, very tasty, and not too salty, with bean curd skins.

- Tung choi: very fresh, in a preserved shrimp sauce.

- \"Pigeon\": the least impressive item, I've had better in many other places.  Overall, from meat and skin, the bird was overcooked and dry.

- ... and the bonus dessert was a small bowl of soy bean pudding, very smooth with just the right amount of sugar syrup added.

Overall, the food impressed me (except the \"pigeon\").  The dining environment would actually be a minus, depending on how you view their choice of decorating it like a street market.  I can ignore it.  Would return here again.  Not sure of prices, as everything we ordered was relatively expensive but may be justifiable if they are house specialties and based on ingredients (ie, fresh shrimp, oxtail)."}
