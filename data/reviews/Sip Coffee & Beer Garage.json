{"text":"This is definitely my favorite spot to grab a beer in town. They always have a great selection of rotating beers, and the food is amazing as well. If you're looking for coffee, they have a nice selection, and live music most nights. It's never had anything but a nice atmosphere, with a friendly staff and friendly regulars frequenting this place. Check it out."}
{"text":"I didn't really get to experience the real atmosphere of this place, so this is more of a drive thru review. I love to support and going to local business and I like the originality. The reason for the 3 stars is mainly the price point and bakery/snacks in drive tru. So the menu online is not what I encountered there. I ordered a small mocha and it said to pull to the window for food items. My small mocha came to $5, so I was hoping it was going to be worth it. The bakery items sounded interesting like an oreo or nutella  handmade scone. However I wasn't going to spend another $5 to try it. Most other items were $4.50 or more. So I just got the drink. It was filled to the very brim. Yes I want every sweet drop I can get, I did pay $5, but I'm driving so spillage was gonna happen. I was hoping the flavor would be above average, but it really wasn't. I thought the cream or milk ratio was a little high and over took the coffee taste. I will give it another try cause it is my closest local coffee joint. Next time I will just go for a coffee. I would also love to chill inside and order a good meal off the menu it all sounds pretty good and the prices don't seem too expensive, unlike my mocha. I do expect to maybe pay more from a local place, but I just can't see paying $5 for a small too often. Call me cheap, but if it was more delicious I wouldn't have as big an issue."}
{"text":"Sip has beer, coffee and live music. Its a great place to get some work done or just chill. It's become my go to place every weekend."}
{"text":"I work close by and I really like this place. The atmosphere is nice, the music isn't too loud, the crowd is diverse, and dogs are allowed so you see quite a few furry friends while there. I didn't have coffee but my Arnold Palmer was delish!"}
{"text":"I love this place. In a sea of Scottsdale fancy drinking establishments (not that anything is wrong with fancy...) this place is as laid back and comfortable as they come! The menu is very simple, but my choices to date have been really good. Their Bloody Mary's are AWESOME! The service is efficient and attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of coffee and beer. The interiors is spacious and relaxing. Awesome spot!"}
{"text":"A few of my friends and I, after having a relatively underwhelming experience at their Scottsdale location, decided to try and give the Indian school locale a shot. We arrived on a Saturday night, around nine, so that a few of us could have a beer and the others a coffee. We saw a decent looking crowd inside, but as we approached we discovered a sign that notified us that Sip was closed for a private party. We came back a few weeks later, and watched as the owner sat at the bar, hanging out and taking loudly like a frat boy, and found his demeanor to be fairly annoying. At first we thought he was just an loud customer, but only later realized he and his wife are in fact the owners. I can't say that the coffee was anything special, but I can say that I won't be returning, because the odds are either that the place will be closed when they should be open to the public or you'll be sitting around listening to the owner as if he's in his own living room."}
{"text":"One of the coolest spots I've been too with its own uniqueness and comfortable layout. Giant bay doors that let a nice breeze through. The coffee is perfect and they have a great bar selection. The staff was super helpful and friendly to chat with. They even have a drive thru at this location which is a cool touch. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"We came for french toast sticks and bagel sandwich, both were no longer on the menu.  The new items didn't impress!  The ambiance and friendly staff keeps this rating in the three slot.  But, if you're looking for a real breakfast - head elsewhere.  My wife and I are heading for our second breakfast.  Easy like Sunday morning."}
{"text":"This is Sips second location and it exceeds the standard set by the first establishment in old town.  The building is an old auto garage, maybe a Jiffy-lube or something of the sort which is very creative. This results to a very unique atmosphere which is open, inviting, and comfortable. During my breakfast the bay doors were open letting in the fresh air while enjoying the modern and urban ambiance.  The coffee was of course delicious, and the breakfast was surprisingly tasty.   The drive through is the cherry on top for those on the go!"}
{"text":"What a fun place! The staff is great, the outdoor seating is perfect on a spring day. The coffee is just right, not too weak, not too strong. Parking is a bit tight, though."}
{"text":"Food and drink selections are awesome !! Will definitely be back when I'm Phoenix! Highly suggest the mac and cheese with broccoli !"}
{"text":"I live in the area and I've given this place a very fair chance. Nice ambience but the service has been consistently terrible and today when I stood in a half empty place and waited 10 minutes for a beer and learned that the guy standing in front of me washing dishes was actually capable of getting me the beer BUT DIDNT I left. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Poor service, no one really paying attention, bunch of kids being hip-I guess, might be good for a beer I guess, my prediction  is this place will be gone in a year."}
{"text":"Cute and sad  The first time I went there the latte was really bitter, burnt tasting, but it's such an adorable place.   I went back last week as I was close by and it's so cute and cool ( I love the building and the quirkiness).  Well, I am sad to say, this time the latte was bitter and had a burnt taste.  I'm so sorry to say cannot go back. Quite a shame because I know they can make it work,  before they lose  too many customers.  Btw: my friend had iced tea and said it was fine."}
{"text":"Being so new, Sip's service and operations are certainly not yet polished. But considering the drive-thru, larger bar, larger food menu, great parking, and larger seating area, there is no doubt that, with time, Sip Beer Garage will be as good or better than its sister location in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Probably the best place I've been in the past year to have a beer and actually hear the people next to me. The owners are amazing and this place has really great customer service"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is a great place to work at. The reason why I gave it a 3 instead of a 5 is because the service is a hit or miss. One of the guys (beard with hat) has such bad body language when taking an order (multiple occurances)"}
{"text":"Great coffee here and very friendly service! Visited Phoenix and was so good the first time (the back patio/awesome weather helps!) we stopped in again before our flight home. I live in the land of coffee hipsters (East Nashville) some of whom fall all over themselves to posture and 'be seen' at places like Barista Parlour and Crema. They make me want to avoid those establishments. I appreciate Sip for being a 0 on the pretentiousness scale. There is no massive sign to take 10 shots in front of for that one perfect IG moment. They keep the overalls and wax handlebar mustache at home, thank God. We felt comfortable in our surroundings, weren't inundated with ridiculous kitchy decor. We went hoping for great coffee in a comfortable setting and that's exactly what we got. Thanks, Sip!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe here at this location. You can definitely sit and do work or decide to get a drink by the bar. They have great coffee too and are open late than most coffee shops in the area :)   Great baristas as well which is a big plus!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee spots in the valley. Great coffee, friendly people, cool environment. This guy Brian made the shit out of my coffee today"}
{"text":"Cool little place, staff seemed pretty friendly. I'd love to come back for beers or cocktails or even food. We went for coffee.   The cappuccinos we had were pretty good. We also got a black coffee to go.   The only thing I didn't really care much for was the pricing.   I could see how the cappuccinos were more but when I saw her pour the black coffee from a normal carafe that had been sitting there I didn't think it would be so expensive for black coffee I want to say it was like $4-$6 for a medium size I can't remember the price exactly.   Anyways this place is pretty hipster and memorable but I may just go some where else for coffee cause of the price point."}
{"text":"So my friends and I happened upon this super chill spot after leaving a nearby bar.  Art and Hailey were amazing!  They were super friendly and made excellent drink recommendations.  I had a delightful,  not overly sweet caramel flavored iced coffee.  Other members of my group tried craft beers and inventive cocktails. If I lived closer, this would definitely be a regular hangout.  Bring a location to the East Valley please!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out :) loved it. The people are great. They're friendly and easy to talk to. The environment is very laid back and relaxed. It's very open since I used to be a garage, which is awesome. :)   Also, for the meme. Take a fuckin sip babes"}
{"text":"Cool place and concept.  Enjoyed their coffee and breakfast-burrito, but I cannot say they were extraordinary.  Still, I'd rather go here than Starbucks and I can appreciate how they've sought to gentrify and reuse an old building.  That's a huge plus and I like supporting local businesses.  In fact, I was going to buy a Sip t-shirt to help spread the word but they wanted $25 for the t-shirt!  C'mon Sip, charging $25 for t-shirt that advertises for you is stupid."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The coffee is good, the limited food items I've tried tasty. The inside has a great vibe. I love the covered, dog friendly patio with misters. They offer a full bar, to include a nice draft beer selection and small but decent wine list. The staff have always been very friendly. Just a great place to meet up or hang."}
{"text":"Built by white millennials for white millennials. If you're in some other demo, they will make your visit unpleasant enough to ensure you don't return. That was my experience, this Sunday morning at 10:45AM. I sat at the bar for 10 minutes and was ignored while the Brunette behind the bar cheerfully poured drinks for the pretty millennials while trying desperately to ignore my presence."}
{"text":"I had my meet up there. They accommodated us by reserving a table for us and directing people on where to go. They also provided us menus. The singer was very lovely. I discovered ginger beer. Very nice place. I am glad I discovered it."}
{"text":"They don't seem to fully have their gas dialed in and I tried 3 different beers and they were near flat. I saw one guy at another table and his beer looked carbonated but his friends was flat and I asked him and he confirmed.  The bartender was nice enough but  told me (in his own words) its because it's micro brew and Im used to \"Coors Light\".  I tend to steer clear of the large and light shitty beers.  This is the 2nd newish bar Ive been to and the beer tap operation hasn't been sorted out. So I think its a new bar thing, I'm sure in a few months they'll figure it out.  Please don't scapegoat the customer by assuming everyone but you drinks microbrew.  This wasn't cask ale they were serving up, this was ales, lagers I tried.  atmosphere is nice and staff are friendly.  I don't think the guy was trying to insult me but its rude to be like,  our beer isn't flat you're just used to shitty beer."}
{"text":"I love the fact that a conscious thought was put towards repurposing architecture, to creating an arena where people can gather and visit--meet Old friends and strangers\", and that is fostered by no TV and by several work/ dining tables done more family style. Clearly word is out for having a friendly place to gather, to work, to share a dog friendly patio, to hear music--the place was full this morning with people doing all of the above. That being said, it is not readily clear where or how to order, and delivery of food from time of order was quite slow--not an issue if you can easily converse with your companions. In such a small venue a loud band is not needed and seriously detracted from the overall experience, made worse by no action taken by management when we pointed out that we could not hear each other across the table. Moving outside was not an option with all tables out front without relief from the sun, and the small patio in back full. As for the food, our omelette a were cooked to perfection, not dry and veggies not over cooked.  Bacon, a rare treat, but desired today, was a combined \"ahhhh\" from all three of us--crisp, flavorful, fairly lean. Breakfast potatoes were a collective disappointment, barely touched by any of us as they were cold and bland. We were impressed, looking around, at Bloody Marys with stalks of celery, wedges of lemon and slices of bacon; and by plates with French toast which would warrant a try another time. Menu selections are limited, which will ideally allow for consistency and excellence in food prep and flavor!"}
{"text":"Ordered food only here before going to Undertow. Based solely on my spinach salad it was so bad so so bad. I don't know why it had -scrambled- eggs on top of cold balsamic drizzled spinach...the hot eggs/bacon/mushrooms made me sick with the salad mix but i didn't want to say that in-front of my friend having her pita...Cold items on top of cold salad would be fine but it was otherwise so gross to have hot eggs on a cold salad and not how it was mentioned on menu. Beer only please, thanks."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to hang and get some work/studying done or listen to some live music (Thursday-Sunday). Love the beer selection. Definitely recommend checking it out if you enjoy great coffee and beer!"}
{"text":"The mood here is calm and relaxed. Definitely a good vibe. The drinks are worth the visit, but I would say the food was sub par.  I would recommend having a couple drinks here with friends instead of something like a dinner date."}
{"text":"I moved to a place that is too far to regularly visit the original Sip Coffee and Beer in Scottsdale, but luckily, they opened up another, bigger, better location in the Arcadia area of Phoenix on Indian School Road. Great craft beer, good quality coffee, wi-wi, live music that is often very good and also not overbearing, outdoor seating, and a drive-thru.  It is quiet enough to study or have a conversation even if there is someone playing music.  They also have great food."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my boyfriends coworker. Went today to check it out. They have a really nice menu for food, and the coffee is amazing. Upstairs looks like a bar/ coffee shop in one. But then you walk downstairs and it's like a boat tiki room bar!! This was the coolest thing I have ever seen, you have to check it out for yourself! And while the drinks may be $11-13 they are STRONG (no need to pre game at home people) highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I visited Sip when I was on a recent vacation in Arizona. Had a great breakfast with coffee there on a Sunday. Food was great and the coffee was well prepared. I also really enjoyed that they had awesome live music on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"What a fun spot!  The atmosphere comfortable and inviting...  The drinks were great and the love music was upbeat.  Unfortunately we arrived took late to eat, but we will be back for dinner another time.  I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Bravo sip! Welcome to the neighborhood! I couldn't be more excited to have a place for awesome coffee available by drive through in the neighborhood. This place is a great spot to work or grab coffee or drinks with friends. The atmosphere is relaxed and there's plenty of space at the tables to bring your laptop and post up for a bit. When I was under the weather they even made me delicious hot toddys ! Impressive- couldn't be more happy this spot has come to our 'hood'"}
{"text":"Such a great place! Happy hour specials too! The cold brew is the best. We had great service and enjoyed talking to the staff. This is a unique coffee and cafe for sure! We have told lots of friends to go there! It was a little tricky getting into if you're heading east on Indian School just be careful making that left turn!"}
{"text":"This place has a lovely atmosphere and friendly service, but the coffee itself is not great. I had a cold-brewed coffee and a vanilla latte, and both tasted like the coffee was burnt."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for over 10 minutes completely ignored by the 3 employees working in that area.  My favorite was the one who was so busy looking at his phone and texting right next to me at the end of the bar.  Return I will not"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to drink coffee with the Mrs. She loves the latte. She is one of those types that doesn't like an overly sweet latte. Sips makes the best latte for that. I've tried the Chemex and the taste is very deep and rich. I also love the breeze that blows through the garage doors."}
{"text":"Love coming here for my morning coffee. The drinks are always tasty & the barista's are so friendly. I love the openness here, especially, when they open all the doors. The music selection is always on point too. I usually come here just for their almond milk lattes, but I've had their bagel and some other pastries before, which were okay. Also, I love that they have all local beers! I've been meaning to come back later in the day to sample some of those beers."}
{"text":"I can only speak about mornings at Sip Coffee & Beer Garage but I'll have to check it out in the evenings some time too. I enjoyed my first visit here about a year ago with a friend. I really liked the concept of the converted service station ( like another favorite of mine: Copper Star ). Yesterday I was riding around on the motorcycle, trying to decide on a coffee spot to read and relax and Sip popped into my head, so I made my way down there. I was a bit apprehensive that it would be too crowded on a Saturday morning around 8:30 ( I typically prefer an earlier start ) but I was really pleased that there was plenty of room to grab a nice table and settle in.   You order your stuff at the bar area, which looks like a good spot on those upcoming beer night excursions to come. I ordered an Americano and decided on the breakfast burrito to go along with. The staff was friendly and my coffee was made quickly. The folks behind the counter seemed cheerful and efficient. Settling in with my book it was just a short time before my breakfast showed up. As breakfast burritos go, it definitely hit the spot but didn't jump out in any particular area. That said, I'd definitely try it again. Salsa on the side was tasty and had just enough of a kick. The tortilla wrap was nice and tight with just enough crispness.   Sip has a nice open feeling inside. Tables are of various sizes and spaced far enough apart so you never really feel crowded. There's a spacious outdoor patio area as well, along with some seating out front. The music overhead was not too loud and wasn't overbearing. Overall, I really like the vibe of Sip and I'll be returning again pretty soon. It's definitely worth the trip down from North Phoenix. Recommended."}
{"text":"Ask the owner anything. No seriously, he's amazing and loves his work. It's like watching to see someone in their zone. Sports psychologists and trainers call it, \"Flow.\" That's what this guy does. He's excited to open yet another location.   This one on Indian School is the craziest because suddenly some weird earthquake music timed stuff happens and the locals don't even flinch.   Turns out there's a Tiki Bar down in the area the garage mechanics used to hang out and overcharge on oil changes back in the day.   And something about a pirate ship, which I can neither confirm, nor deny, was there prior to this outrageously cool renovation and scenester mecca for anyone networking in marketing, public service, legal, finance, NY/LA/SF types who smell money and know Sip Coffee & Beer Garage is a business model coming up!   All my love for your spirited enthusiasm. Too bad I never got any free drinks before this review but I'm not like that. And my accountant hates me for it...  ...stay tuned for my next review RE: FOMO Recovery Centers. I'm not missing out because I've met so many cool people at SIP while hiding away and meeting deadlines, it's kept my sanity in check. Much love to the people from here...  However, you guys are super connected within the biz community so... ha!   Anyways, in the words of Ali G:  \"Ay yo! Maximum Respek.\""}
{"text":"It's my go to spot! Delicious cold brew, friendly staff, and the food is great!  I'm usually here to study in the mornings so I like a coffee and breakfast burrito (add potato and avocado).  Staff is really good at remembering their customers and are always in a good mood! Everyone seems to love their job which is why I like coming back!  Drinks at night are great! And they have a cocktail spot downstairs that you should definitely get your name put on the list for!"}
{"text":"So much LOVE for SIP!  Ahhh where do I even begin! Home away from home! Not only are you able to COMFORTABLY work remotely in this establishment...it is perfect to just hang out and relax or meet for a first date....  I met the love of my life on our first date here so I may be a bit biased!   All in all the staff is AMAZING AT SIP! Super accommodating and always in good spirits! It is definitely a place to go if you are looking to shift your mood or just hang with kind people!   There beer  selection is THE BEST!   Alex makes THE BEST old fashions in town! They understand craft cocktail and the value of presentation!   My children LOVE SIP as they are always so kind to them and we should also  that per my children ALEX ALSO MAKES THE BEST CHOCOLATE MILK IN TOWN!   So much love for Sip! Do yourself a favor and pop in there...thank them while you are at it!"}
{"text":"Visited Sip for the first time. Before entering, the parking lot is full of rough spots, not quite potholes but on their way there. The entrance is around the front which I wouldn't have known but there was another customer in the parking lot that I followed into the entrance. I went inside because I wanted to see what it looked like but I got my order to go. I waited for about 7 full minutes before I was waited upon. One woman was managing the drive thru and the other was tending to the patrons at the counter. I noticed several others seated around the restaurant, all with numbers for orders but none with food. I wonder how long they were waiting. I ordered a mocha and an almond croissant. Pretty simple for a coffee shop but the mocha wasnt even on the list. Once I ordered, it was only about 5 minutes before my order was ready. The mocha was fine, nothing special but did the job. The croissant was giant and I wanted so badly for it to be wonderful but on the first bite, it was crunchy like I was eating a potato chip. The next bites were better, getting to the softer flakey layers but the first bite indicated that it may have been sitting for a little while. Employees were friendly but not so much so that it makes me want to return. I might give it another try. Was disappointed on my first visit because I like to see unique, local businesses not only succeed but to blow me away and inspire me to return. Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Just a great little spot for a coffee.   Always seems to have a cool musician playing music that isn't too loud that you can't have a conversation. Coffee is great and the food options are solid as well.   Have a drive through but if you are trying to park parking can be tough during peak hours.   Also who doesn't love a place that has a tiki bar in the basement!"}
{"text":"I'm seated comfortably on a long couch in the corner of a converted garage space. The room is spacious and well-lit. There is the music of a live duo (guitar & vocals), the clinking of silverware on plates, the expected sounds of a coffee bar. Wooden tables and orange chairs ordain the floor space while unique signage and artwork color the walls.  This is Sip's second location, and it does a wonderful job of maintaining their aesthetic without feeling like a carbon copy. There's plenty of room for larger groups and plenty of comfy furniture if you're here to relax on your own, too.  Expect delicious coffee options, regular live music events, a diverse-yet-unassuming menu of tasty food options and outstanding service from a team of staff that obviously takes great pride in their work.  The wall behind the bar is decorated by an impressive line of probably a dozen different craft beers on draft and wooden shelves set with neatly organized bottles of all your favorite spirits. There's also plenty of good seating at the bar.  If you haven't been to this new Sip location, I can't recommend it highly enough. It's the perfect addition to the area and well worth the drive even if you're not an immediate neighbor. Sunday mornings are relatively quiet and typically feature live music.  Well done, Sip Team, for pulling off another easy favorite. And thank you, Brian, for the deliciously-crafted Chemex coffee - I couldn't have been happier hogging that whole brew for myself!  ;)"}
{"text":"A great day for lunch on a patio so we stopped at Sip and had a chicken salad sandwich with Potato salad and pulled pork tacos. All was quite tasty and the live background music was a nice touch. I'm not a fan of dogs because most are out of control, but to my surprise, all that were there stayed under their tables and were behaved. Best of all, employees didn't pet the dogs then handle food or drinks."}
{"text":"Great coffee and breakfast sandwiches. In the evening they have great live music, great wine and a variety of cocktails. Check out the hidden bar downstairs. This whole place has a cool vibe and is very clean!"}
{"text":"You really don't find very many places that serve coffee AND beer.  It has the environment of a coffee shop where you can just grab a seat, read a book or get something done on your computer. Now I can't guarantee that you'll be as productive after a couple beers in, but it does make the errands a little more enjoyable! The place is a refurbished garage so its very open and they turned the downstairs (where people used to work on cars) into a tiki bar! Outdoor seating available too."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best coffee in the valley! I love the service here too. I even have a drink named after me now.  If you like light ice half caf Almond milk lattes with a splash of cream ask barista Bulat for a \"Cristiana\". I recently tried their breakfast burrito and it's completely mouthwatering! Super fresh eggs!"}
{"text":"I love the tea, the staff is always super friendly, and they always have a great atmosphere. I would probably come more often if they had a loyalty program like Starbucks and D'Lish. I've asked how they do it and they say by memory. That's almost like favoritism. So if you don't go when the same employee is working they won't know how many you've ordered. Only thing missing is a loyalty drink card or app. Only reason I rarely get my coffee or tea here."}
{"text":"Sip Garage is a great bar/coffee shop and I frequent it a few times a week. A great variety of beers and the Mac and cheese is AWESOME. Staff are always friendly and fun."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast here. I stopped on my way to the airport. The avocado toast with bacon and an iced almond milk latte were perfect and tasty! Such a cute spot too, loved sitting in the sun on the patio."}
{"text":"I love a place like this where you can sit and have a coffee while you work, meet up with friends for drinks, or have a relaxing meal. The atmosphere is very chill, there's a good beer selection, the coffee is good, and the food is simple and delicious. Live music on weekend mornings is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Poor attention to service ruined the short experience. The place has a great atmosphere as you walk in, but where do you go from there? There is no host, sign, or bartender guiding you to either seat yourself or stand around like an idiot, so after a minute we sat. We sat for about ten more minutes as we watched others with menus (assuming table service) either sit empty handed or with products from the yet unseen waitstaff. Being short on time and with no room at the bar, we weren't really available to learn the Sip language which evidently bucked the norms of traditional service. The bartenders didn't look stressed, while they were chatting with a full bar, they were in no rush. The beer list is written above the bar in what may as well be invisible ink. These observations didn't bode well for an efficient trip. So we skipped the unusual service management arrogance/carelessness and left after ten minutes. I hope we can try again at another time. The place has a great comfortable initial atmosphere, live music, and unfortunately a cold shoulder."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great ambience, great staff, food is good but could be improved.  Got the chorizo breakfast burrito and it was a bit dry.. not sure what it's meeting but it needs something.  Overall the best coffee spot in downtown scottsdale, just hope they bump up the food up a bit!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee I have had in PHX . My business won't be taking me there for a couple months but when I return in December... look out I'll be heading there every day in town!!  They have a drive thru!! I'm normally anti drive thru but when I'm on a conference call.. and can get my coffee simultaneously... I'm happy !!!  They brew coffee perfectly and the lattes are phenomenal.. hands down best coffee in Phoenix area. I'm looking forward to going back!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to take the pup to! Plenty of outdoor space for dogs and the staff is always super friendly to her. The beer selection is great with a lot of interesting choices. The only disappointment has been the pastries. They're tasty, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Cool beer and coffee bar in a once auto repair garage. It has an OHSO vibe to it with dog friendly patio. Tons of beers on tap including several local AZ breweries. A bit more expensive than other places but a lot of variety. Came on a Friday night and it was somewhat busy but easy and quick access to the bar. They had live music too which was nice to be able to sit and listen and drink to. Sip also has a rum bar speak easy located underneath it which is why we came here. We had to wait about an hour before we could get in, so we listened to music and had some drinks before we could get in to UnderTow. Other than beers being expensive, it was a really cool place and vibe. I'd come back and try their coffee next time and they have a brunch that offers super cheap mimosas and bloodys though."}
{"text":"I always get great service, great coffee, and great food here :) parking is a hassle based on their busy times, but it's not their fault! I always enjoy coming here"}
{"text":"Great open air and patio.  Great selection of beers. Might be stuffy in July. Love it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in mid afternoon for a quick snack..veggie pita with hummus, cappuccino, and a grilled cheese for Picky Child. Food came out quickly. Veggies in pita were delicious, a little more hummus inside would have made it perfect.  Picky Child ate the whole grilled cheese..so, I guess it was good.  Place is a fun place! Cool drive thru..nice & open. Roll up doors..nice breeze..lots of people working on their laptops. Def will stop by on an evening & check it out."}
{"text":"Fun place with a great atmosphere. Great happy your apps for $5 and nice selection of beer. I was happy to find they even have cider on tap! On Wednesday nights this place is taken over by a yoga class so be sure to get your order in early and move as far back as possible to make room for the yogis!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food and beer I would highly recommend it for a fast and casual lunch."}
{"text":"The service was horrible at the downstairs bar. Went there for drinks with some friends & couldn't have been more turned off with the treatment. I could look past it if 1 person was rude but they continued the rudeness by talking to each other in front of you where you can clearly hear.  The concept is neat and wish we had a better experience because the place was really cool."}
{"text":"Love the way they converted a jiffy Lube into a coffee bar; sooooo disorganized at the take out area. They need to take a lesson from Starbucks! Twice I have been there and both times they weren't that busy but just almost seemed they were confused... Coffee was pretty good and the pastries were not very professional or appealing to look at so didn't order anything but coffee. Loved what the architect did to make the place so striking! That was my favorite part of me going there!"}
{"text":"Kaitlyn took care of me this time and the last time I came here, and OMG the service is awesome! Ordered a delicious glass of rose with a strawberry spinach salad. This place is legit. Thank you! I'll be back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Really cool spot to grab some coffee...or beer. Open concept, love the garage doors, delicious old brew, friendly staff. If this were in LA i would be here all the time. Free WiFi and easy parking is also a huge bonus."}
{"text":"Had the cubano which is espresso with sugar filtered in through the process, a style that originated from Cuba. I really appreciated the different types of coffee, (mostly espresso styles) on their menu. Also, the service was great! I had plenty of questions and they answered them with patience.  I also ordered their Garden Scramble which was eggs, Sweet Potato, Zucchini, Kale, among other vegetables not commonly used in egg scrambles, it was very delicious!   They had live music on a Sunday afternoon too which was nice."}
{"text":"I am a regular at SIP. The beer menu is really good and the vibe is fun. I use SIP as second office so I am a fan. However, I had a pretty negative experience today. I ordered an iced coffee with an extra shot. The cost was $7.50 with tax and a 15% tip. I think that price is RIDICULOUS and out of step with the market. I don't know what management or the owner are thinking, but when your coffee is substantially more than your beer you have a problem. I will go back, but not for coffee."}
{"text":"I'm torn. I like this place for atmosphere. It's really cool. Indoor/outdoor. Lots of beers on tap. Etc. my bad rating is mostly based on their menu. I feel like their food is grossly over-prices for what you get. $10 for Mac n cheese...and it's a really small small of mac n cheese. $13 for a turnkey club. Come for coffee and drinks but don't buy food here...they'll gouge you."}
{"text":"Super cool concept turning an old jiffy lube into a coffee shop. Definitely unique and super cool. I had the Kevlar coffee and the peanut butter cookie which were both delicious. Will be back for more again."}
{"text":"Very charming little establishment converted from a jiffy lube into a coffe/craft beer bar. They also have fantastic cocktails  (which I'd say I'm a small time connoisseur of) I got the Scuttle Butt which is a fruity passion fruit based rum drink that in my opinion should be named after something to do with pirates because it tastes like a tropical island in a glass. Art and Hailey were professional, friendly and knowledgeable while showing enthusiasm and excitement for the work they do. The coffee is also fantastic and the beer is great according to a friend who likes beer. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Nice space. Food was meh; could have made better at home. Portions are small for the price. Service is unfriendly."}
{"text":"Great place!!!  If you're looking for a nice, comfortable place with excellent draft beer options, SIP is for you. They have about 20 beers on tap - almost all local -- and they rotate on a regular basis. And they have coffee/espresso drinks to keep you caffeinated. Live music keeps you entertained and the bartenders are, knowledgeable, super social and lots of fun. Stop by this local gem and enjoy a beer!  Open til midnight."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome and unique. The food is great with a variety on tap and a full bar. They often have live music and they open up to a patio during nice weather. It is often busy and it is hard to park, but worth going and possibly parking across the street in the shopping center. Great place if you like to study in a coffee shop - then you can congratulate yourself with a drink when you're done :)"}
{"text":"Good selection of beer. Coffee and teas are good, too. The biggest issue is that parking is usually jam packed, so it's hard to want to go here because we can rarely find a spot."}
{"text":"A real dope place to chill and get some work done or have a beer. I killed 2 birds with one stone at sip coffee and beer garage. Had a cold one and the mac and cheese with brocolli. It was on point. I prefer this location to the Scottsdale location. There are plenty of seating options available here. Def coming back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and coffee. Definitely a go to neighborhood spot. Drive thru option is a plus as is the outdoor back patio.   They get 5 stars for having an underground tiki bar as well."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee house hybrid!  I love the idea and the atmosphere inside is super laid back and casual.  The garage doors on each side really bring in a light and I can imagine it brings a great vibe during the cooler months when they're able to open them up.  The patio does have misters and quite a bit of seating which was being used since the inside was pretty packed.  Great if you have a group of people and everyone's looking for something different."}
{"text":"One of the nicer more eclectic beer spots.  I imagine this will be a packed local!  Pup friendly and the great staff will hit the Yelp pages.  I'm glad I dropped by the former, now converted, jiffy lube....  The bay stations house a kitchen and tiki bar.  Very cool.  I doubt they'll have seats available, hit it as long as you can get in.  By fall you'll be hard pressed ....."}
{"text":"I've been to Sip twice and both experiences have been great. My first time was through the drive-thru to pick up a latte on my way to work, and the second was to have lunch with my husband. So far I've tried the vanilla latte with almond milk, an Americano, Caesar salad and the veggie pita.  Pros: - They offer almond milk - My Caesar salad had a delicious anchovy dressing with homemade croutons (pretty impressive for a coffee shop) - The veggie pita was delicious and full of flavor - They had great live music on Sunday - Dog friendly patio - Friendly service - Modern and comfortable space  Cons: I can't think of any except for maybe the slightly hipster vibe similar to Lux, it might be a turnoff for people (lots of MacBooks), but it personally doesn't bother me at all."}
{"text":"Great place..seating inside can be a challenge..but super friendly staff...great beer list...you can take a casual meeting w/out having to compete w/music (think Starbucks)...food is good...some would think a little on the pricey side. Can't speak to the coffee..only the adult beverages =)   I wouldn't add this to the 'away office' location; but it can be a place to spend an hour or two."}
{"text":"So new place seemed cool!!!!' NOT. Walked in. Sat down. WAit wait no one acknowledged us at all. Finally walked up to the bar. The guy didn't Wat so ever even give me the time of day.  Was thinking at this point it was a self serve place. Needless to say. We packed up and left. And will not!!!! B returning. Tell your friends. Not a good experience. I'm I. The business unacceptable !!!!   It wouldn't even give it a one star. But u have no choice.  Good luck"}
{"text":"Coffee house and bar with a somewhat hidden/secret pirate boat in the basement. What?? Totally cool.  I would have never known there was a little tiki type, boat downstairs from what looks like a pretty hip coffee shop.   The downstairs bar is small only fits maybe 30 ppl so try and go on a weekday maybe? I hear it closes randomly so maybe call.   Definitely a hidden treasure"}
{"text":"I instantly fell in love with Sip because of their wide open space, amazing patio, and fabulous decor. It makes you feel so warm and cozy inside! I came here for a quick bite and coffee with a girlfriend and we got exactly what we came for! :) My breakfast wasn't anything over-the-top special but lets be honest, they're known for their coffee and beverages! The coffee was delish and it really was just what the doctor ordered for us on this sunny Sunday morning. We sat and talked on their patio for a few hours. I saw a delicious looking bloody mary fly by and will most definitely be back to try one of those! I would also love to come back and work from here soon!"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in after dinner. Place was packed.  Beer or coffee we went coffee.  Live music and comfortable setting.  There was 2 patios several dogs and a tiki bar downstairs.  We will be back."}
{"text":"What a beautiful place! I'm a huge fan of all coffee shops, but Sip is especially wonderful! Their outdoor patio is quite lovely, especially during a cool, summer evening.  I love all the lights they've got because they create such a lovely ambiance. I haven't been here during the daytime.  When I was there, they had a live band.  Definitely the perfect place to sit back and relax... Their interior is very homey and cozy. I love the green walls!  I definitely wouldn't study here, though (I tried and failed miserably).  What I really love about Sip is their support for other local businesses.  When I was there, they were giving out free business cards and earrings on behalf of a local jewelry artist.  Parking can be a little tricky, but if you make a few laps, you should be able to score a spot."}
{"text":"Bottom line: this place is awesome. I came in just to drink coffee and get some work done on my computer and I was so surprised. It is a coffee house environment unlike any other I've frequented. Being repurposed from an old auto garage, the natural lighting that pours in and gives you the outdoor feeling without the summer heat. I enjoyed the cold brew and the bustle of the patrons making conversation, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Sip hit the spot. I have heard of Sip but just happened to stumble upon this location over the weekend. I was drawn in by the open lay out and that every window/door was open that gorgeous AZ day. Parking is in the back and as you pull around you can see that this use to be a carwash and that the drive through to this place takes you right through the old carwash area. I think that is pretty cool. We walked through the back patio area and decided to sit up at the bar top. We had the sweetest waitress. She suggested a beer for my husband and I got a black coffee with cream and sugar. The Beer was on Nitro. Nice and smooth. The coffee was perfectly smooth with a touch of sweetness and cream. She kept our glasses full and also manned the bar and coffee station very well.   The bar area is right next to the coffee set-up. So you get to watch the barista's craft their beverages, cocktails, and craft brews. Because of the garage like doors you get to feel the breeze roll through. Or you can go sit on one of their cozy couches, or maybe the cute, modern tables and chairs all around to catch up with a friend or even your emails. They have a wide selection of coffee's. You have your Americano's to your French Press. Nice little selection of beers. Pretty small selection of hard alcohol but every thing you need is there.   I really hope to keep seeing these pop up around the Valley. I very much enjoyed this atmosphere and beverages. Next time I'm coming for brunch and the 5 dollar Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"Well this is my third review for this Sip location....it continues to be me and my wife's favorite Friday after work drink stop. Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and happy to give suggestions. So happy we stuck it out."}
{"text":"horrible breakfast in an otherwise very cool space.   Eggs were scrambled with a little cheddar cheese added, but it looked like something out of an easy bake oven, very strange, small oval casting. Smallest 2 eggs you'll find.  I asked for the bacon crisp, and of course it was not.  good flavor but needed another hot minute on the griddle.  The wheat toast was not buttered, and no butter was offered (I had to ask, and wait). Jelly? all they had was some stupid prepackaged  jelly time capsules. somebody needs to go on a field trip to Matts Big Breakfast and learn how it's properly done.   The potatoes were warm, flavorless, starchy and under cooked. Where do these kitchen people come from?  sure as heck not from culinary school.    The lady who dropped off my food was a very strange and unfriendly person, no eye contact, no words, just plopping down my food in front of me as if she were some kind of a machine - - what a waste of $11... wtf!"}
{"text":"Spending my Sunday afternoon doing homework at this great coffee shop. This is my first time here but this will likely be a regular spot for me now. Sip has lots of tables and I love how much natural light there is in the cafe. Their staff is friendly and they serve tasty cold brew. I also got a little snack of locally made Noble bread for $2. This is a spot that needs to be checked out if you haven't already! Like I said, I will be back."}
{"text":"This place has a super cool vibe.. imagine coffee shop - with great artisan coffee - that also serves craft beers & fresh food. We need one of these in LA! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy chic trend over quality then this place is for you! I ordered an ice coffee with a double shot and the girl behind the counter looked lost and had no idea how to meet my request, my buddy ordered a hot coffee light and sweet which came out not only black but very bitter. The environment tries desperately to be upscale and hip but it's very California-ish where the boys have pretty beards to compliment their skin tight jeans and you knew at any given moment someone was going to be offended by something. It felt more like a safe space for precious millennial snowflakes rather than a coffee shop."}
{"text":"I have been here more than 5x tonight was off, friend ordered a Moscow mule was not that I order wine with ice and sprite yep, she did not add ice. My comment is don't have inexperience staff behind the bar on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"Love this place. I usually meet friends here --- always order the same thing, a mug of coffee with room for cream. Coffee is always tasty and hot regardless of the time I stop in. Only drawback is that I love my coffee with a packet of Sweet N Low. They do not offer the pink packets so I always make shure to have a few in my car / laptop bag. I did try one of their tasty muffins last week -- tasty tasty! This is the perfect indie choice for a sit down & enjoy a cup of coffee. Cheers***"}
{"text":"It's a little chilly today at 37 degrees (ok ok it was a gorgeous morning so far & doesn't really feel that cold-yay for AZ) but a nicely warmed cup of Chemex coffee does warm the soul!!  Now let me repeat how sweet the staff was:  she actually WARMED my coffee cup!!!  Wow!!!  Nice surprise!  Now that's taking the extra mile in service!!  She was also very warm in her greeting & checking on me to see how I liked everything!! It's the little things that make me happy!   First time trying Chemex brewed coffee: very smooth, strong & flavorful.  Bagel sandwich hit the spot (there seemed to be a hint of lemony flavor to it which made it taste more flavorful than dull boring bagel egg sandwich)."}
{"text":"Great place! I love how they converted an old auto garage into a super cool spot for delicious comfort food and drinks. The service is top notch and this includes whether you're using the convenient drive through, sitting at the bar or enjoying a table inside or outside. Outside, by the way, is doggie friendly. Now how do we cut down the miles between this fabulous place and Chandler? Anyhow, pop by and give them a try. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not a beer drinker but they have a lot of craft beers on tap. The tall cocktail I got was good, and served in a pint glass. We were able to go out on the patio at night because it's heavily misted. Dogs allowed on the patio. Live music was good, they played 90s songs."}
{"text":"Best iced Chai Latte! Definitely gets you into the fall mood. The back balcony is great, very chill ambiance. Drive thru is a plus when I can't stop to relax."}
{"text":"I love to sip... at Sip! I was introduced to the sips at Sip on a Friday night when hanging out recently with my lovelies in Biltmore. Ahhh Biltmore/Arcadia... oh how I miss thee! This used to be Jiffy Lube garage now serves up local craft brews, mixology cocktails , coffee and wines! Since I was the DD.. I opted for a strong Java from Cartel Coffee Lab.. One of my personal favorites .. a cold brew, please! You order at the counter upon entering and find your cozy spot.. or sit at the bar! Joanna Joy, a very up and coming local musical sensation was was crooning on her guitar and it added such a nice ambience to this perfect misty , not habooby, Friday night. Yes! There is live music on the weekends here! There are cozy couches and tables to mix and mingle; a dog friendly patio with misters , if you want to brave this heat , but then you may miss the great tunes! A great bar with a lively, engaging bartender! Small plates with local ingredients too, such as tamales or paninis or desserts or breakfast type nibbles. I'm such a fan of places that have a niche for all... Sip is the place to get your Sip! They have a drive thru if you are in a hurry... probably just for the Java , I suspect! Being open til midnight is cool too! Sip is just lovely .. Whether it's a sip with or without :) OH .. now you can go 'under' the garage below to Under Tow... if rum and tiki are the thing you need to wet your whistle... :)"}
{"text":"So the drive through needs a little work but here we go. I called because I was waiting a wile at the window, and let them know I was here waiting. I expected them to be like \"this guy sucks\" but I was given the nicest guy to help me and he even gave me a shot of espresso for the wait. Holy crap what a good guy. Besides the point I was pleased with them and my dirty chai was baller"}
{"text":"Such a cool place to hang out on a Saturday afternoon with a coffee or beer and listen to some live, acoustic music!  I love that the patio is dog friendly too...bonus!"}
{"text":"Churro rum chata  donut  delish!!!! It's a cute drive thru.  Next time I'll have to go in"}
{"text":"From Dallas. Trying some local spots. Super cool vibe. Very friendly and fast service. Great beer selection. All around great experience."}
{"text":"My go to spot for espresso drinks. Coming from Portland it's hard to find great coffee in the valley but Sip is the place. Happy to see they're expanding too, tells me that Phoenicians are starting to notice great coffee too."}
{"text":"Like everyone else in Arcadia, I have been waiting for this joint to open too. When the OT location first opened, a girlfriend and I accidently got drunk on the patio during one of it's first weekends open and the owner and one of the workers stayed late with us and threw a few back. I knew I was going to like this place.   Great atmosphere. I'm a sucker for an adaptive resuse story and the way they turned this old Jiffy Lube into a coffee shop and bar is outstanding. Still very new and working out the kinks but that's to be expected.   SUPPORT LOCAL!"}
{"text":"First of all...it's really misleading to call this a coffee shop.    The espresso machine is a tiny little thing off on the side....but the BAR and taps run for miles.    So just know it's a bar.    The tables were all dirty.   The latte I got was too hot and very bitter - either over roasted Starbucks-like bad beans or unclean espresso machine...or both.    Coffee/espresso drinks are in the higher prices for Phoenix.  The cold/brew toddy was good though.    Ordered a few bites...mac n cheese and artichoke dip.   Both came out way too fast: too hot & the artichoke dip had maybe one choke in it.  Decent flavor after it cooked but...the long blonde hair at the bottom ended the appeal   The mac n cheese.    It wasn't creamy.  Just a thin coating of good tasting cheese sauce but lacking   Ordered two glasses of wine - wow.  Very expensive and short pours.  Pretty sure the bottle of Charles& Charles at Costco costs the same as one glass here!    We never saw another staff person after we got started and they didn't seem to care if we were happy.    If you need alcohol (beers for miles) and have slot of money...this is your place."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check this place out on a late Thursday afternoon during happy hour. There is plenty of seating inside and out. Being an old garage, they are able to open big doors to the outside. It is spacious and the ambiance is pretty laid back. They have an excellent beer selection, but a bit on the pricey side. No table service, so you have to go to the bar to order. Never had to wait long, but could see it might be a problem on a busy night. My biggest complaint on the beer side is that they did not have a beer list with prices and beer descriptions. e.g. IPA abv pint or snifter etc. Just names on a chalkboard above the bar. The bartenders were not familiar with all the beers either. They were quick to offer a sampling, however which was great. Happy hour is one dollar off beers, so still in the $5 to $7 dollar range for what we had. The happy hour food looked to be a better deal with $5 apps, but we ordered burgers. They were excellent. We had the potatoes as a side, and they were just ok. I would give 3 1/2 stars due to the lack of information, particularly pricing, on the beer, but it is a pretty fun space and I will be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to kill some time and I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the coffee and the conversation with the bartender/baristas.  I will def. be back."}
{"text":"Great place. I love the atmosphere and the coffee is very good. The beer selection looks good, I'll be back at later hours of the day. The back patio looks nice too, even in the summer. Looks like pretty good shade and plenty of misters."}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly, and knowledgeable bartender. Great selection of draft beer. Outdoor seating was very nice too!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and have had a good time each time.  Very laid back atmosphere and nice staff.  Recommend checking out down stairs as well - it has awesome custom drinks and feels like you in the bottom of a ship.  Very cool!!"}
{"text":"Great casual vibe. There was a live musician when we arrived who sang some good tunes. Good beer selection. Avocado toast and Mushroom toast were tasty, but a bit pricey at $8."}
{"text":"This is a nice coffee shop if you need to fuel yourself up on some java and bust out some work. The coffee here is good, as well as the treats. I've never came here and ordered a beer, but the selection is pretty good- mainly craft beers."}
{"text":"So stinking cute!!!! Amazing service and amazing food!! If you like mimosas they have those too!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and super friendly staff! The atmosphere was great as well. Definitely going to enjoy the outdoor patio before it gets too hot!"}
{"text":"Came to Sip for the first time but sadly left my debit card at home! Kaitlyn, barista/bartender was an absolute doll and gave me the drink anyway! Definitely coming back here to check out their food, since their chai was so delicious and the live music was great!"}
{"text":"This cute little coffee house makes the BEST iced soy chai tea! Not too sweet but still plenty of flavor and the soy milk isn't sweetened like some places. A wonderful place to do some work, read, or just meet friends. Often has live music and very yummy food should you need a snack! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"In the past we've had a nice experience at Sip. Good coffee, and a great atmosphere.  Last night the staff was incredibly rude. Inattentive and spoke to us unprofessionally. When I ordered an Orange Blossom beer, one server said that it's a shitty beer and not for beer drinkers. I happen to love Orange blossom and it was awkward as I told him I disagree. The staff were bickering with each other. It was a just pretty uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"So glad to have this drive thru coffee spot in my neighborhood. The boys that are there every morning are so wonderful! Thank you for saving me from gross Starbucks coffee. You guys are the best!"}
{"text":"The first time so came here, it was because I wanted coffee,  while a friend wanted a beer. This was the perfect combination of awesome coffee and great selection of Craft brews! The second time I came, I had the warm quinoa salad with mushrooms, and kale topped with a lemon vinaigrette- now I'm addicted. The food here is awesome and the bartenders are always friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place been here twice once for a beer and once for an iced tea. Both times the bartenders were fast and friendly. The atmosphere is amazing. Great to come with a group or by yourself. They have a patio with mysters and plenty of seating inside. I will have to make it an effort to come back more often."}
{"text":"Fantastic Vibe, Coffee, Patio, Food, and charging stations. Ok, so fantastic coffee, but first let me tell you about your power consumption needs. Seriously, portable giant battery charging stations for you to use. They're by the counter lined up like books and you can just pull one off \"the shelf\" and take it to your table with all the USB cords and connections for whatever you might need to charge.    Now back to charging your body. CAFFEINE... in many different configurations.  I had a delightful cup of Aero-Press coffee.  Don't forget a pastry and after recharging your body with delicious caffeine and working for a few hours on their WiFi, reward yourself with a beer.  YES, thats right! A full selection of craft brews and hand crafted spirits to finish your day.  Start your day here with breakfast and caffeine in your chosen delivery method, work for a while, pop over to Gino's (true Chicago style pizza) next door for lunch, come back to Sip, another little caffeine pick me up, and finish working.  Then just close your computer and let happy hour begin with some appetizers and cool beverages.  Hey!..Did I mention your pooch can hang out with you all day on the dog friendly patio? Pretty Awesome!    Lastly, enjoy this place well into the night as the Tiki Bar Undertow is literally in the basement of this place!!! Man, you can almost live here."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place. We visited on a Saturday night, there's a great band playing and the outside patio was a wonderful place to sit. The bartender let me sample several of the beers on tap until we found one that I liked! The beers rotate every week or so so there's a good chance you'll find one you love, but if you don't come back the next week and it will be there then!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great coffee. The baristas here a pull a beautifully sweet espresso shot without a hint of bitterness. I usually need to add some sweetener to my espresso based drinks except for at a few exceptional coffee joints and this is one of them. I have not tried the food but suspect they do that well too.   The back patio is dog friendly. Sometimes parking can get a bit tight."}
{"text":"Always quick, always friendly, and always a good way to start my day. Night time has a different vibe but just make sure you visit on a Thursday, open mic is packed but worth it."}
{"text":"I'm sad to write a bad review, but not completely turned off to this place. I think I'll wait until they work the kinks out and go back for another try.  My friend and I went on Small Business Saturday for coffee. I figured it'd be the perfect day to give them a shot. We opted to sit at the bar, not quite understanding if you seat yourself and get a server, or if you order at the bar. I saw some table numbers floating around, but wasn't sure where to go. The bar seemed easiest. I let our server know that we just wanted some coffee and she quickly handed us menus. I saw French Press and was sold. I really wanted to hang and sip some great coffee. We were sitting at an angle where I could just get a glimpse of the coffee station. I saw our FP's getting prepared and then set aside to steep. Problem is... they immediately plunged the coffee into the water and then let it sit for about 5 minutes. It was terrible. I probably should have said something, but they were busy and I just hoped for the best.  Aside from that, the staff was friendly. I saw a small amount of food coming out. Seemed to look OK. The live music was nice, although quite loud. I'll wait to see if they get it together and try again."}
{"text":"What a little gem of a coffee shop! The first time I came here was for Undertow but I recently have been calling Sip my new study sanctuary. It's perfect to be able to come in and get a breakfast sandwich and latte and post up with my computer and write endless research papers. Once it's happy hour though it's time to grab a beer to keep the creative juices flowing. The atmosphere is typical Arcadia hipster with an eclectic music selection and crowd. My only complaint is they seem to frequently be out of some ingredients for what I want to order. Otherwise if you're in the mood for good coffee, good food, and a bustling environment this is your spot!"}
{"text":"This place had a decent cup of coffee, but I've had a lot better when it comes to espresso. The reason I didn't give a lower rating was my partner had the most amazing chai tea I think I've had in a long time. It was absolutely tasty and delicious. One comment I will make to the staff as they need to keep on top of the tables, just like a competitor across the street, the tables tend to be trashed and not kept clean for customers. This makes pricey drinks a little less enjoyable for me. My big question is why can't they have more comfy chairs to relax and enjoy ones treats? I'm still on the hunt for my favorite coffee shop... And I'm afraid this place might be able to-go cup for me next time on the tea and skip the coffee\latte."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this spot to open, as any independent coffee drive thru is important to this mama!   I ordered my standard hazelnut latte, by which I measure all new coffee shops. It was decent, with a little more milk than I'm used to.   I'll obviously give this place a second try."}
{"text":"Spacey, not too noisy, mostly hard tables and chairs, but there's also some more comfy seating. They have a drive through and dog friendly patio, so those are both wins. Nice, open, natural lighting. You can get sun or shade in the morning. A full pot of French press is a good deal. $3 is a bit pricey for a bagel and cream cheese, but they offer service, so it's slightly upscale. Not yet too trendy to be nauseating. I'll have to check this place out in the evening."}
{"text":"This is a nice place but I like the Scottsdale location a little bit better.  Parking can be really tough here.  You might be better off going through their drive thru window.  The service was good and my small drip coffee was piping hot and priced fairly.  The decor isn't quite as eclectic as their other location but overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hangout with friends or a book. The staff is wonderful, always very nice and helpful. Not to mention the sweet beer selection and great coffee."}
{"text":"Love the vibes of this place. Cold brew coffee was excellent; lots of art and open space. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Lots of natural lighting. Noise level a little loud. Limited indoor seating, but outdoor  seating has misters and shade. Good work environment and hangout location.  Good menu selection - quality food and drinks. Friendly service. Love being able to transition from coffee to beer.   Caught the live music. Overall very pleasant afternoon."}
{"text":"I went there for coffee around 10:30 am on a weekday.  The Good: Good coffee, great concept, lots of people there for conversation to see and be seen. FAST internet.  The Bad: lackluster service, no lids for to go coffee cups, as they were \"waiting on an order\". I tried to get sugar or simple syrup for my latte, and they were \"completely out'.  The Ugly: the bathrooms are DISGUSTING. The Toilet seats aren't screwed in, so they flop around, there is paper and pubic hairs everywhere. Not somewhere I want to be.  There are far better options for coffee in this town than this place."}
{"text":"Walk into a garage to get 7 dollar. Off the wall beer. Then go down to a bedroom size tiki bar. I go to hawaii alot and that mai tai was missing something and cost more then any place on the islands. Wont see me there ever again."}
{"text":"Coffee lovers from around this world. Sip is NOT a real coffee haus. They have one option on brew, which they describe as \"BLACK\".  Sip Is a cute store front that offers coffee, beer,  pastries, food items, free wifi and a place to hang out.   Their decor is cool and there is plenty of indoor seating. The climate is nice. Not too cold and they have a great outdoor patio w misting and several empty dog watering bowls scattered about.   Be careful when coming around Scottsdale Road. The shop is located right on the curve without notice - if you stop short to make it into their tiny parking lot, someone could crash into the back of your vehicle.   The folks working  behind the counter are NOT friendly at all and know nothing about the coffee. I asked what was on brew and they said BLACK. Hum... were they actually describing the  coffee or my shirt?!  Maybe my hair??? Hum...   Their coffee is over priced. They charge $3.00 for 16oz. You get free refills, but are not told this unless you question the price.   The parking situation is horrible maybe 6 slips and a couple of handicapped spots.  So plan on parking around the corner and walking, which isn't so bad.   They serve Cartel brand coffee. My thoughts are: go directly to Cartel, which is less than 1 minute away where you'll be greeted with friendliness, won't be over charged and can find lots of available parking.   Now to their benefit. They also serve beer. I am not a beer drinker so we didn't talk beer at all. For all I know they could be the bomb in this area.   So why not give them a try and form your own opinion.   Also, if you're not a coffee snob, you might enjoy this spot alone or with friends."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out for their craft beer selection. When you walk in it has a cool feel however, I stood at the counter on a Sunday afternoon when it wasn't even that busy for at least 10 minutes not ever once getting any eye contact or service so I walked out.  Clueless wait staff."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been here a handful of times and it always feels like its still my first time. Attended a community yoga session here. IT WAS PACKED! Love the whole concept of this place. The drinks are excellent. They have some good music here on the weekends too. Glad to have this gem in my neighborhood :-)"}
{"text":"Came here on the suggestion of a friend and am a big fan! I'm always on the look out for nice spots to study or get some work done.  This is definitely a good place for that.  They play great music and have good food from what I've tried so far.  I think this is definitely gonna become a regular spot for me!"}
{"text":"So I came through the drive thru the other morning and ordered the bacon breakfast burrito and a coffee. There was no wait and the guy at the window was very friendly. I think the only downfall of this place was the prices. $10 for a breakfast burrito is a little crazy. Especially when there was nothing special about it just bacon, potatoes, and eggs with some hot sauce on the side. Don't get me wrong, it was good but not at that price.  This is on my way to work so I would probably come back, but just for the coffee. (Coffee was great!)"}
{"text":"Best drive thru guy that's ever existed anywhere. The coffee is good but that dude is just awesome."}
{"text":"Sip was like a first date... I had high expectations and when I got to the spot, I thought the concept and ambiance was cool! I could totally hang out here! We ordered our food: two vanilla lattes (one with almond milk), double stacked pancakes and the chorizo burrito. The employees were friendly and they tell us they've been open for two weeks. We sit down and I started looking out the window, picturing myself sitting at the patio (on a nice day) with my vanilla latte and chorizo burrito loving the idea (at this point, I did not receive our coffee or food yet).   So after ten minutes or so, we get our coffee and food. The vanilla latte seemed a little bland so we asked for a little more vanilla. The chorizo burrito was good, but it was the spiciest burrito I've ever eaten and trust me, I like spicy food. Even the hubs said it was really spicy and he loves spicier food than me. It was so hot, that I could only take two bites. My mouth was on fire and I was moving on to the pancakes. The problem was that my mouth was numb from the spice, that I couldn't even taste the pancakes or the syrup so I can't even tell you if I liked it. We leave...and I was at a lost for words because I have no idea if I like Sip or not.   Should I give Sip a second date? I noticed they have happy hour and live music on certain days so I'm keeping an open mind to come back to see if there could be something more than a cool concept and ambiance for me.   Who knows? Maybe I'll fall in love with Sip some day...."}
{"text":"Have you ever heard of \"don't fix what ain't broke\"? They broke this place a little. It's still good, but no longer great.  They changed their menu and got rid of my favorite egg bowl. They offered me the burrito without the wrap but it was not even a close substitute. No more yummy herbs and veggies. My boyfriend's over easy eggs weren't. So bummed. Will be moving down the street to another breakfast place from now on. Luckily coffee is still really good and patio is cute. Sadly, no longer my favorite place for breakfast in the neighborhood anymore. It seems to have lost its casual hippie vibe and turned into just another average Arcadia breakfast place."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and a drink on Sunday. Live music was a pleasant surprise. Female singer whose vibe was chill and perfect for a Sunday morning.  $5 Bloody Mary's and screwdrivers. And they were worth it. Strong pours, excellent spice to the Mary. It was great to watch the bartender take such care with his drinks.  Split the BYO omelet. Bacon and Tomato. They forgot the cheese, but it didn't need it. The bacon was thick cut and the omelet was tasty. The potatoes are cut huge and are quite salty, so if you're sensitive you might want to ask for no/less salt.  We will definitely be coming back here. Got a latte to go and it was delicious. Fresh roasts, perfect temperature and good price. There's outdoor seating, WiFi and lots of space. This is a great place for the start of a Sunday Funday or to recover after a fun Saturday night."}
{"text":"Best Ambience in Phoenix! Amazing coffee,vibe,staff, and live music! The drive thru is an added plus! My new favorite hangout"}
{"text":"Not acknowledged   It is hard to ever think of going back to this place after we went about of our way to go there only to stand at the counter, no other customers,  for over 4 minutes and watched six staffers walk past us. Not one person said a word.   Don't waste your time going here. We won't."}
{"text":"While parking can be a problem here, the coffee is worth the visit. Very cool vibe and a wonderful pet friendly patio.  We also decided to eat here and the sandwiches were huge. Lack of seating and very slow service is an issue. Counter at the bar which seems to have better service. Not enough plugs for those wanting to charge phone or use laptop. Worth visiting overall."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite coffee shop by day and a fun and unique bar by night. I come here to study, celebrate, and sip. I pass probably 10 closer coffee shops to get to Sip--well worth it. Looking forward to spending another year here in good ol AZ with this coffee shop as my go-to. The people are friendly, the weekend music excellent, food great (gluten free banana nut muffins are to die for) and drinks delicious both caffeinated and brewed"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting from out of state and decided to try this coffee shop.   I got an iced mocha and it wasn't great, wasn't bad.  He got a black coffee with cream and sugar and said he could've probably gotten better tasting coffee out of a Keurig ( his words, not mine).  The service was okay, not especially friendly.  I probably wouldn't recommend it for its coffee, unless it's conveniently located for you."}
{"text":"Sip is by far my favorite coffee shop in Arcadia, the food and service is impeccable. The breakfast burritos are quick and amazing. The set up of the coffee shop is also inviting and refreshing with the fresh air from the opened garage doors."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time this week and I really liked the place (the look of it). I was a little disappointed with the pulled pork sliders. If you look through the photo gallery you can find them and imagine how delicious they must be. When I got mine, the sliders looked bleh. It was bun, pulled pork, bbq sauce, 1 slice of pickle, and bun. Nothing compared to the picture on Yelp, if fact it was missing the coleslaw. I ate it anyway and didn't say anything because I hadn't realized the mistake until having eaten 1 1/2 sliders .   The staff (the one employee who took my order and asked about my day) was nice so I like that about the place and I will be back to try other coffee items but I don't think I'll be trying any of the food."}
{"text":"My new favorite coffee place! Easy menu, very quick service, never stupid crowded, staff is always super nice, lots of trendy people inside, could be a great place to work from as well!"}
{"text":"Love this coffee cafe; good coffee and the food is good too.  Nice size patio; great place work when you want to get away from the office."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Sip! We went there on a Sunday night to grab a few drinks for my birthday and we had an awesome time! The bartender, Joey, had great drink recommendations and was really friendly and easy to talk to! Can't wait to go back and try their coffee and food."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a quick drink. We didn't have time for lunch but needed a quick \"something \". Grabbed ice chai & a cookie. Delicious! Sweet & prompt service & they have live music in the evenings."}
{"text":"This would totally get 4-5 stars if they closed the garage door when it's so cold outside! Everyone inside is wearing jackets :("}
{"text":"First time here. Had a great time and enjoyed the beer selections. Live music in the afternoon was a plus. Great entertainment. Hope to come back soon and sit on the patio. Didn't eat but might next time."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio  good coffee, tons of beer options. They have drinks and wine! The staff is very friendly, Kendra was very personable and had great drink suggestions:) the music was just right to where I can still have a conversation with my friends!"}
{"text":"So this is the much hyped (trendy) coffee shop? I don't get it. My latte was marginal at best and I sensed nothing cool here.  Lux has nothing to worry about."}
{"text":"Amazing service, pleasant atmosphere, yummy food...appreciate their hospitality and the selection of fantastic beer!"}
{"text":"You had one job! Everything bagel, that's it. No butter, no cream cheese. What do I get, a plain bagel globbed with Cow teet curds spread on top. Not only that but it took 10 minutes for this disaster of an order to come out which already stressed me for time. This is not the first time either. Last time we ordered a vegan burrito and there was bacon in it. When I called to get my money refunded the kid on the phone blamed it on the kitchen which I call BS. I 'sipped' but I spit that ish back out."}
{"text":"The space is cool! The food is a horrible waste of money. You'd be better to go to Taco Bell. The chai is a cheap powder mix- way too sweet. The coffee... Well. I'm a snob I guess. I think this place is a wasted opportunity..."}
{"text":"PERFECT LATTE!!! I've paid more and gotten less; NOT HERE! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I was driving by because I needed to make a deposit into my bank account and the only bank that was opened was down the street. This was my first time dropping by. It's a pretty cool converted garage space and there's a downstairs room (I didn't go downstairs). I stayed on ground level and had the veggie sammich with chips and drank prickly pear ice tea. Very delicious! The coolness of the space reminds me of a coffee shop I used to frequent back home in Los Angeles. There were outlets and got to do my homework, so that was nice. I noticed there's not a lot of \"cool\" places in Phoenix being that it's not an urban city, but this would be something cool that belongs in an urban backdrop."}
{"text":"My morning routine, great coffee great staff. I get the almond milk latte, they have a Nutella and Banana croissant. Always a solid experience and a good value... brining the craft back to coffee making."}
{"text":"Found this chill spot to sip a coffee or cold beer through attending Stone Brewing's 21st Anniversary celebration. I really enjoyed the setup and outdoor area with the garage pull-up doors. There's also some tiki bar downstairs which I have yet to check out. The beer selection was pretty decent (approx. 24 taps) and the coffee area looked pretty sophisticated--not much of a coffee guy so that's as much as I can say. They have a pretty awesome happy hour which includes $5 off growler fills and $1 off pints of beer.  The only gripe I have is with parking. The lot behind the building is small and fills up fast especially during Happy Hour. There aren't many other options outside of valet parking next store or street parking in the neighboring residential areas."}
{"text":"First visit and we enjoyed delicious lattes while listening to live music. Nice atmosphere and recommend they add trees to the back patio so the parking lot is not so visible. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excited to see their basement addition.  Totally a different feel as the Old Town Scottsdale one, but the concept is intact.  Love this place!  I will be back..."}
{"text":"Food is average.  Great place to hang out though .  Coffee is the best in the hood.   I have to admit the 4th star is more in potential.  I want it to succeed in our hood.  We need more cool places like this."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Lattes are delicious and the pastries are amazing. Ashley always greets with a smile and has my coffee ready ! We've tied coming for happy hour but I wasn't blown away by the appetizers just meh. The atmosphere and amazing service in the mornings deserves  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a large coffee with grass fed butter and MCT oil for a bulletproof coffee to help prevent the crash and keep you fueled throughout the day! A absolute YES and so much Yes at that!"}
{"text":"This location is brand new....so we gotta wait a little longer to get the kinks out. The concept is fun and cool and we did have a good time hanging at the bar while there was live music.  The bartender was this cute rugby player so he and I hit it off immediately. He was awesome! The bar itself is laid back and nothing super fancy. The kitchen is behind the bar and it just kinda smelled like eggs the whole time...which kinda sucked but then they opened more of the doors and it was great.  I was about to give this place 3 stars and didn't want to - so gave it 4. The reason being is that when we walked in, there were 4 people behind the bar and the food checkout area and we had to wait about 10 minutes to get a drink and it wasn't busy. The only reason I think that happened is maybe a couple of the kids weren't allowed to serve alcohol? No idea, but it started to put a bad taste in my mouth about the bar until I met my rugby bud.   I would for sure come back again and hang and maybe even try the food and coffee. I like that there is a cool drive through with awesome graffiti art and their patio is really cute. Like I said, the concept is cool, but ebing new they just gotta work through the bits of kinks they have - don't let you stop this from getting a drink though!"}
{"text":"Speedy hot quality almond milk lattes thru the drive thru are about $2 less than nearby places.  The employees are always really nice & efficient.  I like it here!  Plus, If you're on your way to work, come here - the \"other place\" won't have you to work on time at all."}
{"text":"This is a cool coffee shop that also serves drinks. They serve Chemex coffee, chai, and gigantic cookies and have live music, too. My only complaint is how hard it can be to find parking."}
{"text":"Been here a few times to study.  I have been happy with my Americanos and the staff has been very friendly."}
{"text":"Food was good....only three stars because the service was slow and there's no direction on who's actually helping you....wasn't crowded when we got there and the employees didn't check up on folks...they weren't rude or anything - just not attentive. I have to go back for their coffee as I hear it's great...but until then, we'll keep it at 3 stars."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday for a drink with some friends and was pleasantly surprised by the place. It was busy and full of people enjoying themselves. I love the concept of the specializing in both beer and coffee, the best of both worlds. I wasn't in the mood for either of those on the night that I went, but I did appreciate their beer selection and was happy with the Joel Gott Sauv Blanc instead.   I didn't expect the live music that was performing, but I did enjoy it. Although a bit loud, considering the acoustics of this place (think: gutted auto repair shop with metal and wood tables) I can still appreciate some live acoustic covers. Make sure to dress semi-warmly if you go at night during this time of year, since it is pretty much completely open.  Bonus: I think we were the only people that realized that there are 2 parking spots right in front of Sip (the lot in the back was full)."}
{"text":"Giving it up to the Sips on Indian School. Good food served without a lot fuss on time, place is clean, music not too loud, and atmosphere is upbeat, the mgr is a team player, Brian: takes orders, cleans glasses, while answering the phone. Free wifi, password is beergarage, lots of counter space to eat and type."}
{"text":"What a cute little coffee shop!   I met a friend here for coffee one morning and we sat outside (no misters, at least not that 110-degree day) sweating our bodies off because the indoor seating was super crowded. The place is super hipster, cute as a freaking button and packed. Lots of people on laptops \"working remotely\" and doing what people do during the day at coffee shops. That also meant we were stuck outside, but anyway.   The iced coffee and my friend's chai tea latte were pretty good, but the nutella croissant wasn't super amazing or anything.   The atmosphere was awesome, but misters outside would've made the good experience GREAT.   Way cooler than S-Bux across the street. Great vibe and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this in hopes that they will correct a couple things and make this a five star experience.  Ambiance - 5 stars Coffee - 5 stars   Food - 2.5. I'm hoping they are just working out some first week jitters but I ordered the egg & toast breakfast. Eggs were perfect but my toast wasn't toasted and didn't have butter. The potatoes were seasoned way to much (black from pepper, salt and other seasoning) it was as if the chef hadn't tasted what he prepared - I couldn't eat it.   I've had their food at the Scottsdale location and it's really good, I know they will work out these kinks."}
{"text":"Sip on Indian School has everything I look for in a coffee/food joint...and more! I need places to plug in my laptop, get some work done in a creative environment and have a good mocha with my breakfast. I love the food at the Scottsdale location so am pleased this new location lives up to that standard. I highly recommend the biscuits and gravy! It's sausage based I think, just the right amount of spice and pepper. It comes with your choice of eggs any way you like them. So good I tend to wake up in the morning thinking about their biscuits and gravy. Dang...I want them now! Sip is literally in a garage. An old Jiffy Lube. It's so nice to have the doors open on a nice day. After a few visits you will wonder why all Jiffy Lubes are not turned into a Sip Coffee and Beer Garage. Took my wife on Sunday and we enjoyed the live music.  Sip has something for everyone. I've been there and have noticed hipsters to my right at the bar. A mom and her 4 year old across from me. To my left students working on their laptops. And next to them two elderly ladies stopping by for a good breakfast.  Beer drinkers will also love the choices. There's a board on the wall with a list of beers and some look quite interesting. I wonder what Big Sky Moose Drool is? I'm not a beer guy so I cannot review that aspect of Sip. What I can review is the excellent concept of Sip and their tasteful interior decor, pleasant staff, and tasty biscuits and gravy with side of eggs and choice of bacon or sausage.  I'd love to write another four paragraphs about the house burger as well! So good! I'll post a pic and let you decide for yourself.   Here is my update on March 17th. Sip no longer serves biscuits and gravy. What! I guess not enough people read my review and just had to have biscuits and gravy. So now it's gone. Way to go people. I guess you're all going there for the beer. So now I have no interest in a breakfast sandwich, even though it is pretty good. Breakfast potatoes are good too. What I am interested in is the chicken avacado sandwich. It's my new favorite! And while I am doing an update, I think Sip use to be something similar to a Jiffy Lube but not actually that particular company. You can just ask them, which I obviously have not done."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast!  Fantastic breakfast burritos. Really good espresso. A little chaotic at night, but I love having this little gem close by."}
{"text":"Great coffee (free refills!) and a  friendly patio with water dishes for your 4 legged friends makes for the perfect post hike hangout. And with a killer menu and beer options you're going to fair we'll coming most anytime of the day."}
{"text":"This garage type coffee and danish place turns into a bar at night serving mixed drinks downstairs and representing the ocean!!  The coffee is great and inexpensive and the beer is yummy with all types along with their self made cocktails!!  Its a great place to go and even has a drive thru!!  Im on my way there now!"}
{"text":"An old jiffy lube that was re-purposed into a coffee shop! This is one of my favorite coffee shops to go to in Phoenix! Their cold brews are always amazing and I love coming in on Mondays to get my coffee growler filled! Also their salmon bagels on their breakfast menu is the best, I loved the quality of the seafood and the sesame bagel was the perfect compliment!  The atmosphere is really quiet and relaxing which makes it a great place to get some work done! Also they have a secret pirate boat bar downstairs which has a cool atmosphere, it is really small space so prepare for tight moving quarters!   Also they have a really good beer menu from local microbrews all over the country, so you can probably find your favorite microbrew and get a beer from them!  All in all I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the use of an old garage--just genius! Plus, what's not to love--a lot of beer on draft AND real coffee equals the best of all worlds or for all members of your party.  I'll admit to having to look up what a Kevlar coffee was and then phoning a friend for additional help, which resulted in more Google searches after this text from Mark H. \"Supposed to get good shit through the blood brain barrier or some shit\" and \"is that the one with butter?\" from Nicole H. Plus \"it's tasty.\"   I wish now that I would have tried it, but that gives me at least one to come back.   I did have a cappuccino and will definitely order a Kevlar next time."}
{"text":"Went early to get a spot on a Tuesday morning. The parking here fills up quickly and is then becomes a free for all of double parking in driveway lanes etc etc. The space is very open and the music playlist is what you'd expect, hip and trendy,  so it's easy to see why this spot is busy. Service with a smile is served at the counter. However, expect wobbly tables if you sit at a 2 top. If you're trying to write, type, or anything of that nature, look for napkins to make a shim. Yes, they still haven't figured this out. The customer is left to  deal with it. Avocado Toast was just ONE slice of bread with some mashed avocado, cherry tomatoes, pine nites, and a dash of micro greens. I was unimpressed at the portion size for $8.  Flavor was just so so, IMO first watch has a better version. Cold brew was fine, small is pricey at $3, but average I suppose.  I might try Sip again for happy hour, but won't be exploring their breakfast menu again any time soon."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends for a drink. They have a great outdoor patio and are also dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Nice vibe. Service was helpful and friendly. I had the kale salad which was fresh and yummy, but could use a tad more dressing. Seating inside is a little awkward with large shared tables"}
{"text":"Hip and happening yet inviting and comfortable!  We came here today to check this place out and grab a drink, and we immediately loved the vibe walking in. Sip has a trendy atmosphere that is chill and relaxing. It is laid out to provide space for those who want to mix and mingle, or for people who want to work and just hang out alone in the corner; there is room for everyone. This coffee bar attracts all kinds from all of characters from different walks of life; we saw the computer guy, business man, the cowboy, the hot topic girl, the athlete...it appeals to everyone!   We were greeted right away by the friendly bartender, and got to ordering. We got a beer and a coffee with baileys. The drinks were whipped up in a jiffy and we grabbed a seat at a high top table with cool barstools. The drinks were spot on, and it was a great time relaxing in the \"beer garage\"; a perfect Tuesday afternoon! The food menu looked appetizing, so next time ill come hungry and ready to eat. The prices are reasonable as well. Sip has live music and various coffee shop events that look like a good time, and if a tiki bar is up you alley they have a sweet bar downstairs that is open at night.   This is the place to come to work, play, chill, and grab great drink!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a negative star I could give. The food is alway off the order is alway wrong. If you have food allergies then DO NOT go there. They will apologize but each time there is an issue. Also not a fan of hair in my food and food poisoning.  Note for owner, stop serving food before you kill someone."}
{"text":"Cool interior with fun mix of draft beer, coffees, and I believe - full bar. Servers we're engaged and efficient. Loved option to eat/drink at the bar. Tho too hot to enjoy on this visit, looks like cute and accommodating outdoor dining available. Will return for the entertainment offerings!"}
{"text":"Nice little bar. Management doesn't seem to be very professional. Don't book a private party with them."}
{"text":"Travis did it right at his new location! Awesome vibe, killer food menu and a huge parking lot that means killer group parties. Nothing like it in Arcadia!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome food and atmosphere. Lovin how chill the environment is. Got the Mac n cheese w/bacon and itbwas to die for best I've had yet!. Ceaser salad was very fresh and tasty. Cider was delicious too"}
{"text":"They've done amazing things to this place!! A great place to study, hangout, or get a few drinks (new tiki bar on the bottom floor!). Super friendly staff and great coffee!! And did I mention this place has a beautiful view???"}
{"text":"If you want to get some work done while drinking either coffee or beer, this is a great place to do so. It's a relaxing environment and very open (this place used to be a garage). There's inside and outside seating, but the cool thing is there's also a drive-thru.  There's a parking lot in the back but if people are coming here to do work, there's a good chance they might not leave for a while so parking can get tough at certain times.  They have happy hour from 4-7pm on Monday through Friday. They have select breakfast items that are served all day, including some that have discounts during happy hour! I ordered the breakfast burrito ($6 during happy hour) which was pretty good.  Underneath this place is a tiki bar called Undertow, which is probably one of the best bars I've ever been to. You should check it out if you haven't been. What I ended up doing was drink at Undertow, leave and then order a breakfast burrito at Sip which satisfied my munchies."}
{"text":"Super cute little spot! So glad this is just down the street from me. I think the feel of the place is fantastic. Great vibes. Love the live music for sure. My iced almond milk Americano was delicious with some Splenda. My date loved his French press coffee too. I definitely want to come back here again soon! Wish parking was easier and better though. Maybe next time I'll just ride my bike."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service! The bartenders made great drink suggestions and the band was definitely a compliment to the atmosphere !!!"}
{"text":"I love to read! And I'm always looking for somewhere to sit, read and have an adult beverage. But most coffee shops do not sell alcohol. So I was excited to find this gem of a place.   I love the garage theme going on inside. Kudos to whoever came up with it. The service was mpeccable and beer tasty and cold. This place has \"trendy\" oozing all over it. So ofocurse I loved it!   Also people kept coming in and asking where 'Under Tow' was. Apparently there is another hidden gem located down the peculiar stairs located in the middle of the shop. Next time I come, I'll bring friends and check that place out too."}
{"text":"From St Louis area needed a drink while the wife shopped. Was a great little find. Bartender was awesome.  Great beer selection. Most definitely will be a regular stop on yearly visits."}
{"text":"Place is really cool. Came here to order a iced Carmel latte. There coffee here is below average and probably would never come here for coffee. Other then that i can't comment to much."}
{"text":"An awesome place to chill out. Variety of beers and live music. Friendly bartenders like Arturo, Tim and Luis. Definitely a fun place. I'm considering to celebrate my bday here."}
{"text":"Number 1 Coffee and Beer Bar in all of Arcadia. Great brews, good food, and smooth tunes. A great rotating selection of awesome craft beers from all across the nation, what's better then that?, PBR? Hell no. Also there's an awesome tiki bar in the basement. Come here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I really want to give the place five stars because the food is very good, but the bartenders were such jerks I can't give it 3 stars.  The food was amazing and the place was very cool.  As a car guy, I Loved the idea that the location used to be a garage.  But, the attitude.....  what a crock of bull. It seems like you can only get the bartenders' attention if you were a hipster covered in facial hair and tattoos.  I am extremely disappointed that after having a great experience at the undertow, these jerks ruined it. Again, to be fair to the place, the food was very good, service sucked!"}
{"text":"The last two years, my friends and I have stayed at an Air BnB down the street during Spring Training. Sip is our favorite local haunt. Great food, great coffee, and the live music is always enjoyable. Can't wait to come back in 2018!"}
{"text":"Strong cocktails. Expensive cocktails. Nice atmosphere but not hoping on a Saturday night. Gotta check out the secret bar downstairs though."}
{"text":"So, why do we have one avocado colored wall? I'm not sure that this green color evokes a desire to order more coffee or food or even another beer. Most of the decor is painted light blue which is definitely soothing.  I digress. I'm here for the coffee. That's much more important than the wall color. I ordered a cappuccino in a ceramic cup (an essential element if you wish to enjoy the real flavor). It was smooth and didn't tempt me to add some sugar to temper the flavor.  They do have quite an eclectic menu so you don't have to come here just for coffee. Morning beer is also quite popular for the patrons who were already sitting at the bar at 9 am on a Saturday.  The drive through is cool and utilizes the garage concept perfectly.  The concept of putting a coffee shop in a defunct garage reduces the number of empty car shops  and improves the ambiance of the neighborhood.   This coffee shop is easy to find on Indian School and the only tricky part of parking is if you are driving east and need to cross the traffic that may be backed up from the light. You'll probably need to make a u-turn and approach the store from the east.  There is a large parking lot behind the coffee shop. You should be able to find a parking space most of the time.  I have now been to two Sip coffee houses and I have enjoyed both. Go, do it!!"}
{"text":"The bartender wasn't thrilled about having to double as a barista. How can you be a coffee shop with your grinder not available after you charged me $6 for a chemex. If it wasn't for the bomb artichoke dip and the tiki bar I would not come back again. :("}
{"text":"Four stars for location and ambience, 1 star for their prices. $5.50 for a latte with honey is absurd. Not when there are so many other coffee shops in the neighborhood. I wanted to like this place but not at that price."}
{"text":"With so many great coffee places in Phoenix, each coffee joint increasingly must have an angle in order to stand or for the rest, and I personally like Sip's. Came here during brunch hours on Saturday. With gorgeous weather, the converted garage had a wonderful breeze flowing through the venue so it felt as if we were sitting outside without being outside, and with a live artist singing and strumming acoustic it was hard not to enjoy a perfect weekend afternoon. Boasting $5 drink specials during brunch hours, including Bloody Mary's and selected beers, the craft beer menu includes a number of IPA's and light fruity ales to enjoy, and their coffee menu has reliable coffee you can count on (average strength with nice flavor, I specifically ordered an iced Macchiato with soy). I didn't get a chance to try the food menu, but will come here if I need a place to hang out with friends. I felt comfortable working on my laptop but wouldn't recommend coming here during a weekend to work solo if that's what you're seeking, during busy hours the parking gets filled pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Good coffee, Latte little to strong. Staff usually very nice, no hipster vibe which is refreshing. Great breakfast burrito and there's a guitar they keep in the corner if you feel like playing."}
{"text":"Love this place, but their happy hour could be better.. Good beer, music, nice patio that is dog friendly and decent food. Plus it's only a block from us!"}
{"text":"Interesting place. Coming from the hospital On a super busy night all over the area and this place was abandoned. We got one fufu drink that turned out to be amazing. Sandwich was big but not particularly special or remarkable but certainly served quickly. The name of the place, well, all 5 of us had trouble remembering. The tequila is some rot gut stuff, hOuse wine worse than 2 buck chuck. All in all, wouldn't go back unless everything else was packed. Regarding the coffee, couldn't say."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and each time is just great! The customer service is always great here, the employees are always smiling and helpful when needed. I've gone mostly at night and have sat outside just because the times that I have gone there has been a live band so it can get kind of loud inside but outside is pretty nice. There's always a good amount of seats outside and inside which is always a good thing. I've had their iced chai latte a few times and it's really good and also a good price! I've had their homemade brownies which are delicious and also their mac and cheese and both are amazing! I will definitely be returning to this location in the future!"}
{"text":"Rad little spot. Actually little isn't the right word, it's actually a pretty big place. Very hipster but in a good way for sure. Alex was really cool. He made my daughter the best chocolate milk we've ever had (shaken not stirred). Mushrooms had really good flavor and the beer selection was on point. They had live music so that added to the good vibes. We will definitely be back and are excited to try our more food and cocktails."}
{"text":"Sip Coffee & Beer is right off Indian School and used to be an quick lube and oil change place. They took the concept and made it their own. The bays were turned into seating with tables and high tops with a coffee bar and liquor bar combined. The bay windows roll up to additional outside seating for the cool evenings. On this day they had a gentleman playing guitar and signing that added to the cuteness of the establishment.   Today our visit was for a quick stop to enjoy a Bloody Mary - on Saturday and Sundays Tito Bloody Mary's are posted for $5 and they were delicious. The gentleman taking our order was kind enough to ask the preferred spice level of drink. They were delicious.   The barista / bartender was super friendly and outgoing - he noticed my excitement and trying a new place and even commented how cute it was. Definitely will go back for Menu items."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for the first time. Unfortunately while the barista made my macchiato...she let the milk boil over & then after burning her own fingers, served it to me in a shot glass. She didn't even pour it, another barista had to come do it for her. We decided to try the drip - another disappointment. Watery, under extracted...and just blah. This is a bar first and a coffee shop....whenever they think about it."}
{"text":"I heard this place opened,  And I wanted to try it out. Of course I take my family here for breakfast. Counter order and then sit down. I like the vibe. Love the whole atmosphere and how this place is set up. And what? Bar? Super cute.   We sat outside. Beautiful day to sit out and enjoy a good breakfast. I ordered the egg whites with avocado on a bagel. It was so good, especially with the hot sauce. I asked the guy about it,  he said the hot sauce was homemade.. *TWO THUMBS UP*  I ordered a hot chai tea latte... I seriously think it tastes like Starbucks chai tea latte. Lolz. Maybe that's why I like it so much. Haha.  I'll be back for the hot sauce. Haha."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly here! They make a great Kevlar coffee (bulletproof) and their drinks are consistent every time I go ...unlike Starbucks."}
{"text":"Coffee is delicious!! But I urge do not, never ever, don't even think about it, order food. The breakfast is blahgggagh because no words describe how bad it was."}
{"text":"Great coffee.. BUT the service is soooo slow!!! Why would you only have 2 people working at the busiest time of the day??? (The morning!!) I waited 25min for a small cappuccino. Never again, not worth it. And on top of that they have a drive through. So the wait is never ending. You need to hire or staff more people, because the coffee tastes great but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This cute spot is just around the corner from my place so I'm glad I stopped in to finally try it out. It's trendy, modern, and has great coffee.   We stopped in on a beautiful morning to try it out so they had the garage doors opened up to let in the sunlight. It was cozy and welcoming. They have a general dining area and tucked back in the corner they have some couches and lounge chairs to hang out in for a more relaxed feel. There's also a back patio and front patio for outdoor dining when the weather permits.   The staff is a bunch of young males so ladies, head on in there for some coffee, beer, and beard gazing. They were friendly and quick, my coffee was ready within minutes!   I ordered a sugar-free vanilla latte that came complete with a pretty design in the foam. Check out my pics to take a peek! They also have hazelnut as a sugar-free flavor in addition to several regular flavors. Zach got the cold brew coffee with caramel and it was super yummy. I love a good cold brew and they do it right. Then I ordered their breakfast sandwich with sausage and Zach got their Homestyle Breakfast (name check?) which included eggs, potatoes, and toast. We both devoured our food. The breakfast sandwich comes on a plain bagel which is great because the flavors come from the contents of the sandwich. The eggs was left just a little runny which is how I like it! It's exactly what you'd hope for in terms of a standard breakfast sandwich.   Their beer list had a great variety and the other food looked appetizing. Also, a few people were working on their computers so I'm assuming they have free wi-fi. It seems like a nice relaxing spot to do some work. I will have to head back to try out the rest!"}
{"text":"The manager is very friendly, the staff is knowledgeable about coffee and beer. The food is delicious and there is an underground tiki bar. Live music on the weekends, drink and draw nights, they cater your event and it's in a great neighborhood."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops in the Valley.  If you're driving around lost looking for this place and you see a coffee shop that looks and feels like it could be set up in an old Jiffy Lube location, then pull into the parking lot because you found it!  Sip has a super cool and chill vibe... and expertly prepared espresso drinks!  And for a caffeine addict like myself, I love that their large espresso drinks come with four shots of espresso (a \"quad\" as they say)!  No need to pay extra $$ for those shots that I would have added anyway!  Free, fast wi-fi that I have never had an issue with and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating so you will always find somewhere to plop down and be productive.  And hey, if being productive is not your thing, then wait until you see their beer board!    You can be as unproductive as you want at Sip... just order some of the brews, veg out listening to the live music that can occasionally be found here, or just get in some good people watching at this spot that never lacks a nice crowd!  *****FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"My favorite nearby coffee spot! Such a great concept. I love to grab a latte and read a book or sit out on the patio and enjoy the weather. They have good food options, friendly staff, constantly rotating beer options. I love supporting local businesses and this is one that I find myself visiting at least once a week. They have live music throughout the week, other periodic events or guest taps, and happy hour! Plus, you'll find the downstairs tiki bar if you're there in the afternoon or evening for a fun, seriously crafted cocktail."}
{"text":"I can't yet comment on this location of Sip's coffee, as I only visited for drinks. The husband and I went to Sip in hopes of going to Undertow (didn't get in). We ended up at Sip's bar enjoying a couple of beers. Their beer list is a decent size with a range of beer varieties. For some reason, it took us a very long time to get the bartender's attention to order our beers. The bar wasn't overly crowded and we were sitting at the bar, so you wouldn't think this would be an issue. Anyway, the bar itself was fine, but nothing worth writing home about."}
{"text":"Cool concept but they got it all wrong. I ordered an iced latte with half and half and a chocolate milk in the drive thru. At the window had to repeat order and still wait for them to make. Coffee tasted horrible and very bitter . Extreme stomach pains 15 minutes later I knew that they had given me milk and not half and half like I had ordered.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"This second location for Sip is an awesome addition to this cool section of Indian School. With Pig's Meow, the Attic, Little Woody around here, there is a plethora of awesome hangout options with great craft beer and cocktails/wines as well.   The best part about this spot though is that they have a drive-thru for coffees and morning treats. I've enjoyed several options off their menu, and have found the service in the morning fast, friendly and of course the make great coffee!   Met a girlfriend here for happy hour on Friday, I love how this used to be a garage/oil change joint so the roll-up garage doors and intact and offer awesome light and air to the joint. The decor is cozy with antique pieces thrown in, very much like the Pig's Meow new expansion. Great craft beer options along with some cool cocktails. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Well obviously automotive themes and alcohol always mix. Last time I was at this location I got a terrible oil change so I'm glad the space is now being properly used. Cool little spot I guess other than a few hipsters. Lots of beers and not a lot of alcohol options. I know it's a beer garage but it's still a garage, who doesn't have jaeger in their garage?? I really did like it but am not cool enough to go back. I think they have food cause I saw silverware but really have no idea?"}
{"text":"When you go to the same place two times in a weekend and get the same meal it must mean something. Friday it had a great night scene with acoustic music. Sunday I sat on the patio and enjoyed the sun as I did work. The cool thing about the venue is there is a tiki bar in the basement. This means I will be coming back again to try this out. The wait on a Friday night was a little long as only about 20 people can fit downstairs. I am told you can make reservations.   The atmosphere is great and I love that they turned an old car repair shop into a café/bar.   Both times I got the side salad with the vegetable pita. Service was better on Sunday than on Friday but both times the servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"Came in right before close and Mickey was awesome! Great recommendations on a stout and IPA, overall very chill experience."}
{"text":"This is a cute place with good coffee that you don't have to wait in a monstrous line to get. I tried the overnight oats a few fats ago sand they were delicious.  The only complaint I have had so far is that I wish my lattes were a tad bit hotter. I was a barista for many years and I doubt they used a thermometer. The temperature of a latte is important. Fix that issue and you've got a five star place for sure.   I will be back to try the beer barn aspect of the place some evening"}
{"text":"This place was ridiculous. We walked in (6 of us) and because there were 6 plus a baby, a friend called to make a reservation. They told her they'd save us a spot. We get there and the entire staff was confused on what was going on. We mentioned the reso,  they looked at us like we were purple. I mean, 4 or 5 people just walked by us while we stood there and offered no sort of help. A kind lady moved her stuff from a picnic table so we could sit together and then we never saw a server again. Nobody came out to give us a menu, tell us how this place works, bring us water....nothing. So, we sat there for 10 minutes while we found another place to eat. If I owned this place, I'd verse my staff on how to say...\"hello\" or \"have you been here before\" or basically anything to 6 people willing to spend $. It's cool though, someone DID get our money. Have fun with this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Their rotating tap list is super fun and I'm always excited to try something new every time I come here. The bartenders are incredibly sweet and friendly as are the people who come to eat/drink here. Overall the atmosphere is so welcoming and it's a great place to get work done or to hang out with your friends."}
{"text":"...best Chai I've ever had and I'm having dreams about this yummy pastry called a \"Man Bar\" ...Bacon, Chocolate Chips, Bourbon ...concoction."}
{"text":"This is a cool spot. An old garage converted into a hip restaurant. It was comfortable coming here for just coffee or for food as well. The drive through is even fun. Service was good and free refills on coffee is appreciated. I ended up having the avocado toast- small for the price but they had pine nuts in it so it really was extra special.  I want to try this place in the evening sometime."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good coffee. I love to support the mom and pop establishments over the big box guys any day of the week. I definitely recommend checking it out."}
