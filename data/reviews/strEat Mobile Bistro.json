{"text":"I had their Four Cheese Mac & Cheese at the Solon fireworks. Tasted awesome! The service was very friendly too.   I hope to try them again sometime."}
{"text":"Best food truck I've had so far at Walnut Wednesday this summer.  I got the burrito with pulled pork and Tijuana Taxi toppings and it was great.  Everything tasted fresh and despite the long line, it moved quickly.  Highly recommend adding one of the many hot sauces they have at their window- don't be afraid to venture out of the household names.  It elevated it to the next level.  Small complaint is that I wish the burrito was a little larger for the price, but still enough for most people as a lunch portion."}
{"text":"I recently had an intimate birthday party catered by streat and it was fabulous. The food was so decadent and both Izzy and Jay made sure to provide me with a meal that I could not have had in any restaurant setting. I mean, how else can I have gourmet mac and cheese and duck confit tacos in one sitting? The guests absolutely loved the food. I cannot imagine having an event of any size catered by any other business. This food is so *expletive* good. I am almost at the point of irritation that I do not have any more of the food left to eat, it was THAT good."}
{"text":"Surf and turf at the science center party was the greatest mix of flavors my taste buds have ever been privileged to encounter. Great guys and great food!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love. Tried this at the Yelp Science Fair and then sought it out twice after that. Consistently delicious and on top of that the service is great!  Try the Potato Reuben for sure!"}
{"text":"It's a shame there are only 5 stars to give. Jay and Izzy brought the truck and their crew and catered our wedding. Nothing short of fantastic! The least positive feedback I've heard from our 200+ guests was 'amazing'. No kidding. Our crowd ranged in age from 21 to 85 and was very diverse, culturally as well as economically. Not an easy task to make all of them happy at the same time. And I mean ALL of them. There's always those people that complain about something or other, right? The ones you can never make happy, or the ones that tell you it was ok, but would have been better if you'd only done something different. You know who I mean. Not at our wedding. What makes it even better was the guests were telling us as we walked around how much they were enjoying the food! We didn't ask them. They told us, unsolicited and have continued to do so the entire week after the event. The conversations went pretty much like this...'Congratulations you guys. We're so happy for you. Oh my god the food is incredible!'.  Again...not kidding. The food was unique, plentiful, delicious, and beautifully presented and maintained throughout the entire course of the evening and the staff was almost invisible but everything was always perfect. I've worked in food for 35 and a few years, and spent a good number of those catering large venue and off premise sites with one of the largest and most reputable catering companies in Northeast Ohio.  I understand what they did and appreciate the logistics and obstacles they were faced with and I can't give high enough praise to the execution and presentation. The site our reception actually happened at was the 4th site we'd moved to. Our original venue was shut down 4 months prior to our wedding and then we had 3 more site changes in the month prior to our date. Where we landed was not an easy place for a caterer to work. They had a 6 ft wide access corridor behind the space that was a 30 yard walk to where they were able to park the truck. So they could set up one small prep table, a third of a football field from their kitchen and that's how they serviced a party for 215 people, and it was flawless. I also want to mention that all along the way, as we were constantly having to change sites for one reason or another and going through unimaginable stress as we were got closer and closer to our date, Izzy was consistently calming and reassuring and made us feel like our wedding would be perfect. Nothing takes the place of dealing with pros.  Both Izzy, and Jay never made us feel like we had anything but the best working for us, and when it came down to walking the walk, they did a job that made us proud and would have made kings and presidents proud as well. We can't thank them enough, or recommend them highly enough."}
{"text":"Yum diggity!  I could eat the pulled pork and buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese everyday.  Unfortunately, I think my arteries would have an aversion to that.  Seriously good food.  Even the, \"truck made chips\" kick ass.  Look for a Yelp check-in deal for a complimentary soft drink or bottle water with the purchase of any entree sandwich.  Good stuff.  If you absolutely need to know where strEat and the other food trucks are, cruise over to www.ohiofoodtruckfinder.com and stalk, er, follow them."}
{"text":"Great food!  I have been to several owner events at Porsche of Beachwood that strEat Mobile Bistro has catered. Let me just tell you their food is amazing! I have tried just about everything on their menu and trust me, you can't go wrong with any of it!  The Pulled Pork Ciabatta has pulled pork, Radish slaw and Sriracha Agave Aioli and is delicious. The Four Cheese Mac & Cheese features Swiss, Cheddar, Provolone, and Parmesan Cheese topped with your choice of toppings candy cola bacon, pretzel crumbs, broccoli, buffalo sauce is a winner also. Even the Truck Made Chips are great. The staff is always friendly and get you your food fast!   I'm glad to see that the food truck phenomenon has hit Cleveland too. Each mobile food truck is so completely different from the next so it's a cool adventure tracking down a truck to sample their unique food.   They also accept debit/ credit cards."}
{"text":"got food at the orchestra july 4th event. mac and cheese was delish. smothered it with bbq sauce. also got the pulled pork sandwich. a bit dry. decent."}
{"text":"Had the veggie naan-wich here on a Walnut Wednesday and wow. It was amazing. That naan bread... Need to try it out again sometime."}
{"text":"Just used Izzy and his awesome crew to Cater my daughters wedding. Great food. Super caring, happy professional staff. Went above and beyond the whole night. Yes they should be your caterers"}
{"text":"Today in the 30 degree beautious weather I thought why not venture out to grab a bite from a food truck and check out the lunch concert in the Ameritrust Rotunda. After scanning the trucks, the mac n cheese sounded perfect...on second look got the Mesquite Chicken Chili mixed with the Mac & Cheese with an avocado sauce on top. OH MY I think I found a new favorite! Portion was enough to save some for tomorrow and I'm surprised I could even stop. The guys were great-helpful-friendly and funny. I'll be back again soon! Keep truckin'!!!"}
{"text":"After sampling several brews at the International Beer Fest yesterday afternoon, I was left heavily intoxicated and ridiculously hungry.  Thankfully for me, the perfect comfort food awaited at strEat Mobile Bistro.  Blurry-eyed, I still managed to make out the words \"Mac & Cheese\" for a price of $6 on their menu and ordered immediately. Service was super friendly and fast - plus, they take credit card.   As for that Mac & Cheese. . .it was absolutely everything I ever wanted at that very moment.  Ooh, and the panko was a very nice touch. Basically, I devoured within minutes, maybe seconds even."}
{"text":"To be fair, I can only review a tiny bit of their actual food, because - as of yet - I've only tasted two little morsels. But not only were those morsels utterly delish, these guys are primo gentlemen.   At the Yelp Science Fair last evening there were many amazing vendors and lots of yummy food to be sampled. The guys at strEat Mobile Bistro had a Surf and Turf combo to try: a tasty little shrimp and polenta bite, and a beef bite. I wish I could recall more details on the actual bits and pieces - I remember cilantro I think, and a tasty little pastry shell, and a melt in your mouth little bit of beef, but the one thing I remember is the yummy factor.   What put them over the top for me - I approached their table and lamented that I'd have to skip the offering because of an allergy to mushrooms, a component of the beef snack. Without skipping a beat, they offered to make me one without. Not only did they follow through with that and made a special little plate just for me, but one of the guys actually came and found me as I'd wandered away from their table to get another glass of wine while waiting. Well above and beyond the call of duty - it's not often you get service like that in a restaurant, much less from a food truck vendor at a sampling party - and when I tasted my custom creation, I was even more in love.   I am very much looking forward to finding their truck out in full action one day to sample more, and thank them once again for being super awesome."}
{"text":"Had a chance to try out StrEat Mobile Bistro when they made a stop on the east side. They've been in my neck of the woods before, but...it's hard to choose between Dim and Den Sum and anything else.   I'd have to say that the actual food truck seems nicer than some of the others I've seen around town. Perhaps more like something you'd see out west? The menu is fairly limited, but there were a few vegetarian options - Buffalo mac & cheese, butternut squash soup, and the fun-guy mushroom sandwich.   I went with the fun guy sammie and soup and my co-worker dining companion had the pulled pork sandwich. Or, as he called it, \"the best pork sandwich of his life.\" My sandwich was ok - literally nothing to write home about, but the soup! Wow! I've never had such a flavorful butternut squash soup. It was creamy with a hint of spice. I could have eaten a gallon if it, I'm sure.   I'm glad to see that the food truck movement is expanding in Cleveland. Each mobile food truck that I've seen around town is so completely different from the next that it's a neat experience to track down a truck and try their unique food.   P.S. This truck accepts credit cards! Hooray!"}
{"text":"There's rarely a big line at this truck, and the reason is not what you think. It's because they crank out their orders quickly. I like that kind of speed when I'm standing on the sidewalk in the sun/rain/heat. Like the other trucks, they change their menu a good bit, but their vegetarian fare always seems to please me. Their house-made chips are excellent too. Their standby pulled pork is consistently good, but not quite at the level of a well-made PBLT from their rival. The thing is, I've never been let down here. Whatever I try is good, full of interesting and often healthy ingredients, priced well and served fast."}
{"text":"Delicious! Sandwich had lovely flavors. I only wish for maybe something a little spicy and more of that delicious molasses sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Streat Mobile brought their food truck to our wedding and IT WAS AMAZING!! Sage and Izzy were so wonderful and so great to work with. The food was so delicious and our guests loved loved loved it. 100% recommend this business for lunch or to cater any event. :)"}
{"text":"This specific review in in regards to their catering services & not the truck or the owner (Izzy) himself but his rude a** assistant.   I am having a wedding reception at a local park shelter house where there is no kitchen & thought a food truck would be a fun & smart alternative. So I contacted StrEat Bistro to discuss their catering services. I'll admit, the owner , Izzy) responded quickly & was incredibly enthusiastic about his menu. But since they were opening a restaurant that same night, he didn't have time to go over details & was going to have his assistant contact me.   Well, to put this simply- she's a greedy, arrogant, rushed A**!  Jamie (I think was her name?) was abrupt from the get go. I clearly stated that my fiance & I were not looking for anything special to be made but had gone over the menu they provide on their site & had picked selected items we would like to taste.  Since neither of us have ever visited their food truck, would it be possible to do so. She never answered that question but skipped right over it & instantly tried to push items that were not on their main menu ( & I'm assuming more costly) on me.  Now, I'm pretty open to suggestions & understand the process of up-saling, etc but the way in which she conducted herself was very rushed & pushy. .. Once we got to talking about ME for a change & not what SHE felt should be done, the subject quickly changed to budget.  Through out this entire process, their were too many long & awkward pauses. She then became a bit snippy as if our conversation was a huge inconvenience to her & she had better things to do. I felt unwelcome and stupid :/ When I was finally explaining  that my budget per person was roughly $10.95 to $14.00 (which I don't think is bad. After all it's a food truck where most of their items are under $10.00) she got even weirder on me. Again with the long silence, her response was very similar to this \" Eeeeerrrrr....uuuummmm....yeah. *enter long pause*  I don't know, um..... you're budgets too small... *enter another long pause*I can come up with another menu and call you on Monday or Tues of next week\". Of course, I knew she was NEVER going to call back just by her attitude & I was right!   On what planet does not putting yourself in debt over catering a sin? I don't think my budget was too difficult to work with (again, most items under $10.00 off of their menu). especially because they majority of guest are small children & are not going to be eating $14.00 plus in food. Seriously- a complete b**ch!  I will never seek out their truck nor their restaurant unless it's to punch her in the face!"}
{"text":"I hired Izzy and his team to cater my wedding food truck style. They did an AMAZING job!   It started out being a dreadful 100% chance of rain with a low of 52 degrees. Not exactly my dream summer wedding.  After talking to Izzy about it he made me feel so much better and that we would get through this.  He assured me it would all be okay.    Cut two, day of wedding, still rainy, not as cold.  Then five o'clock rolls around and the sun starts shining!  That's what time my ceremony began.   He had the Mac n cheese bar setup inside along with a summer salad and Mexican street corn on two tables.  It was beautiful!  We had a grazing bar as well.  He served pulled pork sliders and mahi mahi tacos from the truck.  It was perfect!!  It had such a nice flow of things.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Everyone was and is still raving about the food.    Not only is it great quality and well put together, it's affordable too.   Thanks Erica (the chef) and Izzy for making my dream wedding come true!"}
