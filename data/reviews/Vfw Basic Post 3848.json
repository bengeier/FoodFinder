{"text":"My gf and I have been on a mission to find a great hand battered fish fry. I am from Buffalo and enjoy a  Friday fish fry which I haven't been able to find in Las Vegas. Many places offer fish fry's but none have impressed me yet. My search is over!!!!!!!!!!!    The VFW POST 3848 has the best fish fry in Las Vegas!!!!!  It was our first time here and when we walked in, we ordered 2 fish fry's. We then proceeded to the bar for some beers before dinner. We were greeted by Doris, the bartender. She was super friendly and made us feel right at home. Our fish fry's were delivered to our bar seats by Dan, who is the food manager/chef. He was also super friendly and told us how he developed his amazing beer batter for the fish. We also chit chatted at the bar with Chuck, who makes the  homemade cole slaw. This place really is a team effort.   We met several other customers who were super nice and we had a fun time.    You should put VFW POST 3848 on your list of places to try as the food and people are great and everyone that works here is a volunteer!!!!!!!     WE WILL BE BACK SOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim the other night. There were a totally of six of us in the place, including the bartender. Usually we get stared down by the people in VFW's, but the people in here were so friendly and welcoming.  Ended up playing pool with them and buying each other drinks back and forth.  Great drink prices and good for shooting pool and hanging out with locals."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming in to hang out with friends, and several of the bartenders are friends as well.  They have evenings designated for different dinners, a fish fry on Fridays, and even a breakfast buffet! I've been hanging out at this place for a couple of years and the food element is a big step up!    The atmosphere has improved with the addition of a touch tunes jukebox, as well as other ambiance touches.  The BEST fish fry I've had was at the \"W\".  The fish was fresh, good quality, and cooked to perfection.  Fun place to check out!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Very friendly staff and patrons! Excellent prices on drinks and food! Fish fry was great!!"}
