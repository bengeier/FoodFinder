{"text":"Awful food, slow service.  Bread was dry, meat was fatty, skimpy on cheese... Save yourself the disappointment and eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Elevated Mall prices aside.  This place made a decent sandwich that hit the spot... not too much and not too little.  They cook your cheese steak to order so it does require a wait.... luckily it was a weekday and the mall wasn't too terribly busy.  I can't imagine what it would be like on the weekend since there was one person at the register (also doubling at the fry station) and one cook at the griddle.

I got some fries with my cheese steak and doused them with seasoned salt (there's a shaker at the counter so you control your own destiny).  There was also malt vinegar for use as well.

Don't get me wrong, cheese steak Connoisseurs would probably laugh at my idea of what a cheese steak should be.  But this place makes a decent one in Northlake Mall thousands and thousands of miles away from Philly."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a bite to eat before a movie at North Lake AMC 14, so we went to the food court in the mall. I had never eaten here and had been wanting a cheesesteak so I thought I would give it a try.
The steak was thin, piled high and cooked just right. I go the provolone cheese route rather than the cheese whiz. The bread was good, but not toasted or grilled as I prefer.
The thick cut natural fries were crispy and not greasy and were very good covered in malt vinegar.
Their slogan is \"The Premier Cheesesteak\". Was it that good?  No, but it was a good solid, filling sandwich.
A cheesesteak with fries and a drink was $8.55, which I thought was a little pricey for mall food court food.
Overall, not bad, to me it was just missing something to qualify it as a premier cheesesteak."}
