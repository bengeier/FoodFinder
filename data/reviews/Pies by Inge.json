{"text":"I live down the street from Pies by Inge so the smells always tempt me when they bake on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

On Friday mornings they have cinnamon rolls --- you can choose buttercream or cream cheese icing.

I always pick up an assortment of goodies for family gatherings. I wish I could claim them as my own. For Christmas I picked up chocolate chip cookies, a slice of white cake, iced sugar cookies, and a slice of lemon meringue pie. All were consumed with much satisfaction!

You can pick up treats from Pies by Inge at the Brown Bag every day but Sunday. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pies by Inge starts baking in the morning and the smells waft into the parking lot behind the restaurant, enticing, beckoning, and demanding to be sniffed out. You can enter the shop from the back or just go into The Brown Bag and purchase Inge's treats from their restaurant. I've had every kind of cookie, a couple slices of pie, and the cinnamon rolls; I've never been disappointed. Their Facebook page really has more information than Yelp. I highly recommend going to Brown Bag, getting a delicious sandwich, picking out a few treats from Inge, and calling it a day."}
{"text":"YUMMY YUM YUM!!  So good!  I came based on the reviews on Yelp and was not disappointed!  Peanut butter and chocolate brownie and PB cookie like pie!  I wish I lived closer! Definitely go and enjoy!  Just realize it is inside of the Brown Bag Deli - we drove around and around trying to figure out where it was!"}
{"text":"The pies here are amazing! You can find them inside the Brown Bag Deli. So many delicious pies! Literally any pie you can imagine!"}
