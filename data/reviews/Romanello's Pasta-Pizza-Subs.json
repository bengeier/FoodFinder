{"text":"A bit of a dive but good food and reasonably priced.  I had the Italian Cheese Steak.  The two women running the lunch hour are hard working and very nice.  It is great supporting local busness."}
{"text":"Dated look. Pretty good pizza crust and toppings. Pasta is microwaved but not bad.  Bread was moldy. People were nice but food was not.... don't think ill come back.  Oh by the way over priced for the food you get."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good,although the place seems to be going down hill. Prices continue to rise every time I am in there and the place gets dirtier by the day. I would say it's just okay."}
{"text":"Lived in Huntersville since 94 and have had pizza from here 100s of times. Always loved the pizza crust and sauce but not so much with the canned mushrooms etc. Muncher Crucher every time. Big shock the last time we ate there to find the crust and sauce has changed. It was so bad I don't think I could take a chance it was a one time deal. Going to miss the usual pie here. This place must have changed ownership ;(  Please tell me some rookie was making pies that day!"}
{"text":"Fairly new to the area and was hoping to find my go to for a good cheesesteak sub. Well I'm still looking.  I placed my order for provolone cheese, mayo, and tomato.  I got peppers , onions,  steak um type meat, provolone,  and a glob of mayo on top of it all. FAIL! Too hungry to wait another 50 mins to get the replacement."}
{"text":"Romanellos is a good huntersville classic, been here for years and has really good sweet tea and ranch dressing and while there try the cinabites they are very good!"}
{"text":"Terrible food run fast!!! Ordered the chicken parm sub. It was the most terrible sub I've had in my life!! The chicken was just like rubber I can hear it as I chewed. I called the restaurant back and spoke to the older gentleman that took my order and he was going to resend a different sandwich but then he told me to dig out the unassembled sandwich out the trash and give it to the driver!!!! I started to question the restaurant sanitation standards and started to read their reviews . All I was reading was how terrible the food is and how dirty the restaurant was with mold and moth balls all over the place. $17 dollars  for a 5 inch sub and tiny tiny side salad! Stay away!! Order jimmy johns if u want a good sub or use grub hub and order real Italian food from a restaurant. Not to mention there is a $2.50 delivery charge!! If you order from her you might get sick!! I hope I don't get food poisson from the few bites I took. Not to mention forwards the middle of the sand which it was cold. I'm here on a business trip and work in the restaurant business this place is a joke. Will dispute with my credit card company. Extremely disappointed and disgusted"}
{"text":"Not as good as it use to be two years ago. They have changed their sauce and put less toppings on the pizza. Twenty years ago when they were Huntersville's only Pizza place in town they use to know how to make a pie. Too many better choices now."}
{"text":"Live 7 minutes away.  Ordered a pizza @ 6:15 PM.  Received a room temperature pizza @ 7:55 PM.  Need I say more.  If you're hungry and like your pizza hot, order from anywhere else"}
{"text":"I posted a negative review of the pizza, wings, and drink, mistakenly under my wife's account. The owner responded, no offer to make it right, just \"I'm sorry you didn't like our food\" and the he proceeded to defend bad food, slow delivery, a cup of ice(that they called a drink). If your gonna get a bad review offer to make it right for the unhappy customer to try to retain there business, rather than make excuses and say the customer is wrong. I read other reviews as well, and any responses to the bad reviews  were the same, excuses, saying there was nothing wrong, saying how they've been in business for 30 years, blah blah blah. Own it dude, your pizza sucks, your so called jumbo boneless wings that would satisfy a cat, and poor delivery time, and a cup 3/4 full of ice when finished, do not make for \"good food\"! and when I said I have had caffeteria pizza better, I mean it, my school pizza was better than this tasteless, soggy, no topping, cardboard pizza. I moved here from Mi. and I have been looking for a \"good pizza\", so far Pizza Hut is the best I've found in Charlotte. Romanello's is worse than Domino's, at least when I had an issue at Dominos' they gave me my order remade another day for free, and a free item of my choice. So while they messed up initially, they made it right, that is why I will go back to Domino's, but never to Romanello's."}
{"text":"I've forgotten how great Romanello's is. I live close and went to high school even closer, which means we hit Romanello's many times before practice and some games. Not too healthy for the lady's basketball team. Lol I can't remember how old I was the first time I had the pizza, but I know it's still just as good. Perfectly cheesy, good sauce, crisp pepperoni, what more can you ask for in a good pie? Oh, it cooks fast too! Granted no one was there when I took my little cousin to try the Huntersville classic (After working out. Shame on us ;) We waited no more than 10mins. If your in the Huntersville area looking for good pizza, definitely check out Romanello's. They don't have the best d√©cor on the inside but the pizza makes up for it."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. My mom and I decided on Italian food tonight for dinner and ended up here. We prefer to try out smaller/ mom&pop restaurants instead of a chain, and tonight we hit it out of the park. She had the chicken parmesan sub and I had the Tuscan Shrimp Alfredo. The chicken parm sub was so yummy. The sub roll tasted like it was made fresh today and the chicken parmesan was so flavorful. My meal was incredibly delicious. Everything within the dish was spot on. The pasta was cooked perfectly, sauce mixed with veggies and shrimp was to die for. We also ordered the tiramisu, which was the icing on the cake, absolutely no disappointments there. The owners were super friendly and chatted with us for a bit. We are so happy that we stumbled upon this place and will most definitely be back. Thank you for an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"A huntersville staple.  Good lunch specials, great calzones and pizza."}
{"text":"One of the best regular pepperoni pizzas ever, also my husband requires Gluten Free and felt his was the best he has ever had in the 30 years since his diagnosis  So grateful we are only 2 miles down the road."}
{"text":"Romanello's, I love you.    When I moved to Huntersville 16 years ago it looked completely different than it does today.  There was no Target, no Cook Out (!) and nobody had even dreamed of Birkdale (well, maybe.  I don't know how long it takes to plan something like that)  But Romanello's has always been there.  Before there was a Pizza Hut or a Domino's in the area to order from we ordered from there.  And even after they came, we continued to order from there.    The pizza and calzones are great, but don't sleep on the subs and my favorite, the cheeseburger!  It's not the best cheeseburger I've EVER had, but it's amazing for something you can have delivered to your house.    If you live in Huntersville and haven't eaten here yet, you're doing it wrong!"}
{"text":"Looking for a good whole in the wall pizza and pasta joint? Look no further. The staff and owner couldn't have been nicer. Restaurant was very clean, good ambiance. I ordered the chicken parm with pasta. It was not breaded! Yummy! Chicken was juicy and flavorful. Pasta cooked al Dente. Sauce tasted homemade. Even the garlic bread was fresh. Chicken parm came to the table hot, cheese nicely melted.  They have tv for those who want a basketball game.  If everything around seems corporate and breaded,fried; check out Romanello's  You will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"First ordering from here. Pasta dish was ok . Pasta a little over cooked. My real gripe was about the tiny slice of cheesecake I got. For 4.99 a slice ..I expected more and also NO STRAWBERRYS . One and done for me !!"}
{"text":"I came here with my fiance while we were getting our car worked on. This place is a local family owned and operated restaurant. We ordered a pizza and garlic knots and were not disappointed! They were both very good and very well priced! I will totally come back again! I love the food and I love supporting local business!"}
{"text":"Cutest decor and environment, great place to eat in at. My fettucine Alfredo wasn't that great, but the owner was helpful with my order and my partner LOVED his sub:) Would recommend. Local business support is important, so eat here!"}
{"text":"If I could give them a worse score I would, ordered delivery first time eating here. NEVER again. Pizza was worse than school cafeteria food, soggy crust, barely any toppings and just not good. I ate entire 12in minus a piece my wife ate, and I wasn't full. Then I went and got her Chipotle . The menu said \"Jumbo boneless wings\" 5 piece $4.99 they were chicken nuggets like you'd find in a frozen foods isle at market, smaller than MCDonalds nuggets. The drink, I finished it in about 7 sips, and had 3/4 cup of ice left over. The salad looks good I haven't eaten it yet. I had to go get my wife something else to eat. The Online app for ordering was confusing and difficult, cannot edit have to delete item and start over. No way to check on your order, delivery was over and hour and food was barely warm. I paid $34 and $5 tip for this! Never again!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering on and off from Romanello's for the past 10+ years.  The consistency is sketchy at best and prefer to support the small business owner rather than big box.  We continue to order from them as they usually have a good product. Don't get me wrong, we've complained about all of the issues we have had and only once have received a free pizza.  This weekend was the straw that broke the camel's back..... we called for a pizza only to be put on hold for 5-minutes.  When we finally called back, we were asked our address - the owner got on the telephone and indicated that we've complained about having the pizza stuck to the top of the box and all of the cheese and toppings looked like it took a ride on the track at Charlotte Motor Speed - he refused the business. Glad to know that a local business owner thinks he can serve a inferior product and continue to get business. It brings new meaning to the pizza bars at Harris Teeter and Whole Foods.......  so much for supporting the small business owner."}
{"text":"Owners are super nice! Family run business. Best chicken parm sub ive had in all of the area! Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, first time for this place. Took an hour, which was ok, they told us. My husband ordered a specialty pizza that came extra cheesy. He liked it a lot, but wasn't extra cheesy as described. I get a basic pepperoni and it is triple cheese and missing sauce. Doesn't fit the description. Not sure how they forget sauce but it tastes like unseasoned cheese on cardboard."}
{"text":"Lackluster service to be frank. A co-worker ordered food to pick up Tuesday, I called on Wednesday and tried to order the exact same thing. Only to be told that they couldn't do special orders because they had a meeting earlier in the day about how they needed to stop taking special orders. I was trying to order a Buffalo Chicken calzone, remember the same one my co-worker had the previous day. Girl on the phone told me if I wanted to call back in 15 min I could talk to her manager \"Pam\". NEVER HAVE I EVER HEARD OF A RESTAURANT NOT MAKING FOOD THE CUSTOMER WANTS ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY EXTRA!!!!!! What happened to the customer is always right? Anyways, I didn't write this review the day of but obviously felt strongly enough days later to do so."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative score I would.  The delivery was 30 minutes late.  The food was cold and gross.  The pizza was like card board and I actually threw my chicken parm sub in the garbage after one bite."}
{"text":"Wow. Excellent little spot. Meatball sub is phenomenal. Great bread, excellent sauce and oh, my, the meatball! Really friendly staff. My new go to for meatball subs. I'll cant wait to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"AWFUL! If you're not familiar with high quality Italian food, this is NOT the place to discover it! We had a meatball sub and a sausage sub. Both were peppery hot. I can shake on my own red pepper or tabasco sauce if I choose. Hot pepper is what you use when you need to hide lousy food. Both meats were over-cooked leftovers from days ago. Same for the dark marinara sauce (if that's what it was.) The bread was steamed to restore it from its staleness. We threw away most of two inedible sandwiches, then I made peanut butter and jellies. BTW, the next morning on the toilet was an adventure!"}
{"text":"Romanello's is very close to my clients office so I popped in to try a sub (my choice was between Romanello's and Jersey Mikes and to be 100% honest I'm more of a JM gal in the sub dept. ). I will say they had a many lunch combo deals - I did the half sub and fries but paid $1 extra and went with the salad. The salad dressing was really good and homemade though the salad was your standard iceburg with a couple tomatoes...stick with fries. There was plenty of meat on my sub and it was just fine, though next time I may try a different Italian specialty."}
{"text":"Best place ever. Wings lasagna burgers they have it all! Sam and Payal are awesome. Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I ordered carry out and upon arrival I smelled that \"bathroom smell\" and not a clean bathroom smell. HUGE TURN OFF! Ok it's not the end of the world, but then I heard the sound of a vacuum or shop vac running behind in the kitchen. I'm guessing it could've been a grease trap being emptied. Either way find a new time to do that or light a few candles for your guests. The interior of this place is very wore down with chairs covered with colored tape and old looking carpet, it's not appealing especially since I'm about to eat. The saving grace was the pizza which was pretty good. Nothing too special but the only reason it didn't get one star. Also I suggest letting your staff smoke out back not right next to your front entrance. So basically it's good pizza while you have to smell poop and cigarettes? Cmon man!"}
{"text":"Excellent fast delivery nice family people the food is. Great they know my boss by name they deliver on time Everytime with that great food of theirs"}
{"text":"Great food nice people way better than jersey mikes next door!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I love that it is always buy one, get one half off. Their subs and salads are not excellent, but average. The delivery service I wish was a little faster, considering I live 5 minutes away. For this 2 reasons I give 4 stars, but again the pizza is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Wonderful service. This place made my stomach happy . Definitely will visit again  Thank you to romanello's macaroni team"}
