{"text":"After being disappointed with the Chinese food restaurant near my house that I was a regular at after it changed owners, I looked around for somewhere else that offered simple Chinese takeout at a reasonable price. I got everything I wanted with Yang Chow, and I'll gladly keep coming back here again and again. 
This time, both my girlfriend and I got lunch combos (she, chicken cashew nut, and me shrimp cashew nut). They were both great, and neither of us left hungry. And I was pretty impressed by the amount of chicken and shrimp they included. And all for under $15, including drinks!
The owners were very friendly, and seemed to sincerely appreciate our business. 
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I missed having items like broccoli and cauliflower in the veggie mix. It wasn't bad or anything of the sort - but a simple mix mostly of carrot, celery, onion, green pepper, and baby corn. 
If you like your Chinese food simple, quick, well prepared, and inexpensive, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to visit this place and finally dropped by today and ordered the combination plate C2 for lunch. Let's go by the menu step by step. First the egg roll had no meat only cabbage, I don't like cabbage ,strike 1. Second was the beef chop suey it was tasteless probably the worst I've ever had, strike 2. The sweet and sour ribs were inedible as I couldn't even bite into them but the sauce was OK, strike 3. The chicken fried rice was lacking any flavour as I was hard pressed to find any chicken, they are out. The only reason I gave them 1 star was because the complimentary fortune cookie was tasty. I threw out 90% of the meal and will not be returning ever."}
