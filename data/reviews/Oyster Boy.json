{"text":"Only oysters I've had in Toronto were from Rodney's and these are definitely par for the course.
The fries are crazy good with their lime aioli, the steamed clams were killer with the broth, and of course all the oysters were fantastic.
We had to try their deep fried panko crust oysters, the Cascumpec Bay oysters from PEI, Beach Angel oysters from BC,Wiley Point oysters from Maine, La St.simon oysters from New Brunswick and Copps Island oysters from Conneticut.
They're all great but the Beach Angels were my favorite for sure.
All oysters come with a side of horseradish of course and a choice of a red wine vinegar base sauce, a traditional seafood sauce and a chipotle base sauce.

I would say Oyster boy has better service than Rodney's, but I would say Rodney's has the better food. May just have to eat at both places back to back to properly compare, which I wouldnt mind at all."}
{"text":"Fresh oysters, tasty other seafood dishes, friendly staff. What more can one ask for?"}
{"text":"I would say, only come here if you're planning to eat oysters because it is the best in town!
Great little place so you might need to make a reservation in advance.
Server knew a lot of things about oysters and gave good suggestions...(*hint hint: PEI, Peacock and Kunomoto are the best!), good prices & great service. 
Fresh oysters cracked open on the spot with alot of good selection! 
Only one small criticism, and that is that they need to work on their main dishes a bit more. The Sturgeon tasted old and salty while the Mussel sauce could have been less salty."}
{"text":"A friend and I came in tonight and they took us in without reservation. 
The waitress/hostess was nice at first, but when we asked to be moved to a booth she started giving us attitude. (We made sure it was okay with her, but she didn't respond). After mentioning it was our first time, she still didn't make us more comfortable by giving us lousy advice on what to order. Her answers were wishy-washy. She said \"If you ask people here, some would say they like it and some would say they don't,\" which doesn't really help me decide what I want to eat. She was really knowledgable with the oysters though. It also took a while to get extra sauce when we asked, which didn't come until we were almost done (we refused because there was no point anymore). 
I was a bit shocked at the attire of other guests (more dressy than casual), but maybe Queen West hipsters don't like oysters or seafood.
Oysters = great, but on the expensive side.
Service = lousy, could be better
Environment = quiet
Overall food = good"}
{"text":"I love oysters -- raw, baked, deep-fried, and even in congee! It only made sense I give Oyster Boy a try since I was in the area last night.

Considering it was a Wednesday night, my friend and I were quickly seated without a reservation. My initial thoughts: mellow atmosphere with rustic, oyster-themed decor and great service.

I checked Oyster Boy's menu on their website ahead of time, but when I sat down, I noticed the Bouillabaisse is no longer offered (as with a couple other items). The server told us that mussels are not in season and they are a part of this dish, so they temporarily removed it from the menu. Ah, I was really looking forward to it! I am not sure if all seafood restaurants do this, but it is nice to know that this restaurant does not offer something they know may not be good. 

We started off with half a dozen of Cascumpec Bay oysters, as recommended by our server. I do not dress my raw oysters any more than a squeeze of lemon and a little bit of cocktail sauce, but I did try a bit of the horseradish with the vinaigrette and the gingery sauce, which were not bad.

We also ordered half a dozen of baked oysters, and we got to try Rockefeller, Rustico, and Royale. My favourite, by far, is the Royale because of the tasty crab meat and the creamy BÃ©chamel sauce. Mmm... Next would be the Rustico, then the Rockefeller because it only reminded me of McCain's thin crust spinach and provolone pizza. =P

Next up, we tried the Crispy Crab Cakes. These were deep-fried to perfection. I'm not a big fan of lemongrass, and the flavour of lemongrass was strong in these crab cakes, but they tasted all right. The slaw was nothing special, but their house-made relish, known as \"chow chow\", was great.

I definitely do want to return to try their Bouillabaisse when mussels are back in season, and perhaps I'll give their deep-fried oysters a try too! Their Fish Tacos and BC Dungeness Crab & Bay Scallop Pasta sound delicious, too."}
{"text":"In Toronto for two nights & ate here both nights..pretty darn good.

Our server was so sweet and charming.

Oysters were so fresh..so good..opt for both raw and cooked..can't go wrong.

Forget the mignonette..the banana pepper & ginger sauce was killer good.

The clams in their awesome broth & the fish tacos were standouts!"}
{"text":"Great oysters! Stopped in for a few drinks and oysters to tide us over before a late dinner. Love that they serve it with freshly grated horseradish and nice big wedges of lemon. Good service, helpful staff, fresh oysters, reasonable prices - need I say more?"}
{"text":"I went with my another guy friend, and had  a great time eating oysters.
They only had 4 different oysters the day we went but seems like they have more variation usually. However, four was enough for us to taste one each and order an another Dozen of it. 

I think I will just come here to have a nice wine and oyster. other food was ok. Maybe the oyster was soo good that the other food didnt taste as good as oyster did... LOL 

Wish they had happy hour or something but its worth it to go =)"}
{"text":"I love Oyster Boy! Not only is the food wonderful but the staff is fantastic! Jen is always smiling and great and Luke always makes us feel welcome - Sometimes he shucks and sometimes he serves, our last visit he did both! He's great.

I haven't been there in a couple of weeks, I think I need to call and make a reservation now!!!"}
{"text":"It's my favourite place for Oysters in the city. Fish tacos are excellent."}
{"text":"Update: July 19th 2013 
I had to update my review, after writing this review Adam the owner of Oyster Boy contacted me personally. What surprised me the most was that he actually took the effort to find out what the issue was and what happened according to my review, indicating that he really cares about his business being well and finding issues that comes up. He offered us a change and improvement to the issues the next time we return to the restaurant. 
 
I told my friends who who vowed not to return after the previous disappointing service and persuaded them to return with me again. We had a BRILLIANT time on a Thursday night  and they saw a few of the servers that they knew from regularly going to oyster boy before. 

Oysters that we had were amazing, very knowledgable sever whom served us. She kept answering our questions about the oysters when the  free of us were confused with the different choices. 
The shucker name Tyler was really friendly, made us amazing oyster shots and kept checking on us when we ordered the raw clams (they were amazingly sweet and flavourful btw!)  

The shellfish salad is my favourite, really worth it for the price! It comes with a bit of everything. 
Sturgeon ceviche was a little too citrusy, veryyyy appetizing.
Steam calms were amazing, every time I order it the taste and flavour is consistent. None of the clams had anyyy sand in it, which makes me a very happy eater!!!

Really want to thank Adam and his team for how they dealt with the whole situation. And also for the wonderful meal.

My friends will definitely return again and I am very happy for that!!



-----------------------------
Busy night. Horrible service by  both our server and the guy that shucked the oysters. 
Amazing service by a guy that was not our server, he was polite and very caring. Great mains too. 

My friend tried to talk to the guy that shucked the oysters for recommendation (Our server barely gave us any answers to the taste profile of the oysters, besides saying everything is amazing).  The guy that shucks the oysters was talking to two ladies sitting at the bar, he kept telling my friend to order from our waiter when my friend told him we were just asking for recommendations.  

This is the first time at oyster boy or any seafood restaurant, but the server actually served our mains before the oysters and told us our oysters are coming soon. We waited a while for the oyster and was a little surprised so we didn't say anything. 

The mains were amazing, the pasta was very flavourful and just the right amount of sauce. The steak fritz were very marinated well, but tough to chew. Bouillabaisse was really delicious, clams and mussels were cooked just right!

In the middle of our main the server dropped our oysters. 
The oysters were badly shucked, they were all a bit sandy and almost every one of them had flakes of shell in it. 

I guess the server noticed we weren't very happy and barely came to our table, another server took over our table instead. He was our server previous times we were there (apparently he works Tuesdays a lot). He asked us how our food was when he noticed we didn't finished our oysters and recognized my friends as regulars. We told them about our situation with the oysters and how it came after the main. He was very nice and instead of our server, he apologized to us of what happened. 
Our server never came back to our table, so we asked the nicer server for the bill. 

Lesson learned....
-don't go there durning weekends
-don't go there when they look busy...
-basically go there only when they are dead or weekday. 
-sit at the bar the guy that shucks the oysters will be nicer
-only have the skinny server with dirty blonde hair (sorry I forgot his name)
-have the mains, maybe except the steak"}
{"text":"As you'd expect from a place named Oyster Boy, they have a really great offering. Their price list breaks it down by region (PEI, New Brunswick, BC, Nova Scotia, Pacific US) but make sure you take a look at their blackboard for their specials. 

What went in my belly:

Kumamoto Oysters ($3.50 each/$21 for 6/$40 for a dozen) - These oysters are similar to Kusshi in size and texture and have a really clean flavour to them.

Black Point Oysters ($2.75 each/$16 for 6/$30 for a dozen) from Nova Scotia - They don't have the same tenderness as the smaller Kumamoto's but were still quite tasty. 

Sustainable Seafood Chowder - shell and fin-fish, New England style ($10) - It had just the right amount of creaminess and overall it was a decent chowder but probably not something I'd order again. Over the weekend, I tried their ridiculously good corn chowder at Soupstock. Perhaps they should add that to their restaurant menu..

Steamed Clams - garlic, white wine and parsley ($13 small/$17 large). The clams were well cooked - not too chewy, and while the broth was a touch saltier than I would've liked, it was a classic clam dish done well.

Oyster Boy Fries ($4.50) - I was surprised by how large the portion was. It came in a large bowl which was overflowing with addictive thin-cut fries. The fries here come with a choice of chipotle, lime jalapeno aioli or curry sauce. I went with the chipotle and had no regrets.

So... Oyster Boy or Rodney's? I think Oyster Boy is my winner."}
{"text":"My gf decided to surprise me on our 10th year together going to this place...Since I am a big seafood LOVER!!! We came just after 9PM where the restaurant was about half full... We were seated quickly and started off with two beverages.

I had the Dark & Stormy which is spiced rum with ginger beer. Its quite tasty i'd say. We were trying to try lots of food, so we went big by going 4 apps and 2 mains...

Chowder ($11)- Light, creamy, not salty, and had a bit of fish, mussels. Nice chowder. Portion is right.

Deep Fried Oysters ($12)- 5 pieces of panko crusted oysters (kushii or some small oysters) with pickled veggie and slaw. I like how the slaw and pickled veggie accompanied the oysters. I didn't feel the oyster bite as much as compared to the panko crust...A bit too much crust in my opinion...

Brussels w/ bacon ($7)- This is their featured special for veggies. Its glazed with Maple Syrup and double smoked bacon. Its tasty as well, and well seasoned i'd say.

Crab Cakes ($12)- Served with some aioli mayo sauce and some veggies. This comes two thick hockey sized crab cakes. I thought the portion of the crab was very nice, and breading is just right for this cake. Definitely one of the better crab cakes; however, there are one or two restaurants I've been that serves better!

After eating all this, we were getting quite full, but our mains were coming about 10-15 mins after.

BC Dungeness Crab & bay scallop pasta papardelle, lemon butter & arugula - $24
- I actually like this papardelle pasta, but it would be nice to have it cut, instead of a long flat hanging noodle like spaghetti. It tasted nice and light, but the bay scallops showed more than the crab meat.. I maybe noticed two decent size crab meat and some were mushed...

Grilled halibut with seasonally inspired succotash - $29 (Girlfriend's)
- This was grilled nice and looked very moist and juicy. And it definitely tasted fresh for shizzle...

Now where the food really stood out, we definitely felt the service was a bit lacking. I believe only one girl asked us once 'how was everything, and if we required any pepper on our food', but besides that, no more coming to us, unless they drop off food or cleared it all when we were done. Maybe they all tip pool, so not every server wants to try as hard. When taking our order, they were not that informative about dishes so we can visualize. 

Food is a solid 4/5
Service is a 2.5/5
Atmosphere Seating is a 2/5

I thought the seating is not very comfortable, and definitely not good for big size group to join in on this restaurant capacity seating of 40 possibly.
I would come back again for the food in the future, and if the service improved more that would possibly entice me to come more often.
(btw- even with the lacklustre service we still gave 18% gratuity of our $120+ bill)

I know possibly most people won't do that, but this is our 10 year anni, so I'm being quite nice today. =p"}
{"text":"Went here for my bf's birthday on a very busy Saturday night. We were late for our reservation by 30 minutes. They had given our table away (understandable), but was quick to find a new spot for us at the bar area instead. 

Even though it was so busy, their service is fast (especially with the oysters) and the staff maintained their friendliness throughout the night. 

The oysters were fresh, and they had a good selection to choose from. 

Ordered a grill red snapper ($45) and didn't expect a whole fish to come out. Takes 2-4 people to finish depending on appetite. 

Will definitely return for those oysters again though!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with two friends, prompt and friendly service, very accommodating, and the food was very good. Worth the wait and the price."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for good seafood, and Oyster Boy is definitely the best around. I've been here for every special occassion, from christmas to graduation, over the past year and I've never been disappointed. Not only are the oysters always fantastic, the staff is very knowledgable about the oysters, as well as wine pairings. The oysters are served with an awesome mignonette, fresh horseradish, a bomb cocktail sauce, and a really awesome mango salsa. There is a good selection without being too much to choose from, so you'll always be able to try all the oysters within a dozen or so.

The entrees are also amazing! Especially the fresh pasta and the fish tacos. And for desert, I always order more oysters!"}
{"text":"Oysters so fresh its like they just came straight out of the ocean!  Not for people looking for a cheap meal as the bill adds up rather quickly but if that is not a concern it doesn't get any better than this in Toronto!"}

This is the best oyster place I know, bar none.

Can't comment on the food"}
{"text":"I love Oyster Boy, which should be clear from the five star rating I give it. I love the service because the staff strike the right balance between courteous and friendly, remaining professional and knowing when to interject and when to leave you be. In addition, they know their oysters! I learned a few things just by dining here, despite being brought up eating oysters fresh from the beach.
Go. Now."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch yesterday, we were happy to get a seat.
The caesars were on point, and hit the spot.
Big fan of their oysters, and we had the raw ones as well as some of the hot ones which were great- next time i look forward to the deep fried ones.
We also had the seafood platter, it was pretty good but we felt it was missing something, perhaps a sauce?
Overall I had a good experience and I am looking forward to coming back and trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent. And the owner is extremely knowledgeable and taught us quite a bit about oysters. Always loved eating them, but knowing more about them is cool."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp accommodated .5 scores as I'd give Oyster Boy a 3.5 out of 5.

My partner took me here for my birthday last week. Being a fairly recent convert to the delicacies of oysters, we've been trying out a few places. Not sure why I avoided them my whole life but what a revelation.

As far as our visit to Oyster Boy, the highlights were definitely the oysters we had as appetizers. After some solid explaining by our server, we settled on a couple varieties. Delicious! Fresh, flavourful, meaty and tender. 

Second highlight was the bouillabaisse my partner had. Other than the over cooked and rubbery clams, the broth was delicious and the shrimp and trout were outstanding. Also some of the tastiest mussels we've eaten. I had the halibut and chips which was solid. Beautiful, flaky, large piece of fish. Nice crispy batter. The fries were soggy and over salted but the side order of onion rings made up for the disappointing fries. Incredible crispy thick onion rings with chipotle aioli. Yum!

Over all solid service, including the odd gentleman who presented our oysters.

The few negatives that pulled down this rating were the very mediocre and disappointing beer selection, the uncomfortable stools we sat on, the soggy greasy fries and the over cooked clams. 

We'll come back, but next time we're eating oysters at the bar and ordering wine."}
{"text":"Oyster Boy is my favourite oyster bar in Toronto...it's actually one of favourite restaurants in Toronto. If you're a true oyster lover, this is the place to be. Really cozy, friendly environment. Everyone's super nice and really knowledgable. Not only are their oysters great, the rest of their menu is delicious too. Great chowder, clams, mussels, fish tacos, fish and chips (their fries are delish). I just posted a full review on my blog today. Check it out! :)

{"text":"We \"walked-in\" to this tiny resturant and asked to be seated.  The bartender asked if we had a reservation - no.  They offered us a seat at the bar which we didn't mind.  Our server was anyone behind the bar which we were cool with.  We ordered 1 dozen oysters quickly cause we were rushed into it.  The oysters came and they were ever so fresh.  The sauce were good too.  We waited 15 minutes to order another dozen again - yes they were that good.  Then we wanted to order other food, but we were not getting the attention of anyone.  The service is really slow and no one really cared about serving us.  I'm not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"I had eaten a few oysters here and there, but never had I sat down for a full meal of the raw seafood delicacy that everyone loves so much. I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday since she is an oyster-lover and I have to say that, although squeamish at first, I was a full convert by the end of the night.

The service was incredible. Our waiter recommended a range of oysters since we had no idea what we were doing and he was able to explain the taste notes of each type as if he was describing a fine wine. We ended up trying 5 different types (from both the Atlantic and Pacific) and enjoyed them all to varying degrees. We also had the deep fried oysters (loved them!) and the smoked fish and cheese plate. The flavours were a bit bold for me, but my girlfriend enjoyed everything. I've heard the fish cakes are a must...I'll have to try them next time.

The place is extremely small so I recommend making a reservation if you don't want to have a long wait.

And if you loved it so much you keep blowing your paycheck (oysters can be pretty pricey), they also wholesale their fresh oysters so you can eat them at home!

Highly Recommended. A++++"}
{"text":"We love Oyster Boy. I visited my boyfriend who lives in Toronto a few months ago and we came here for some oysters before dinner and we loved sitting at the bar. I visited again this weekend and saw online they do an oyster shucking class so I called for more information. They're reworking the class and didnt have a class scheduled for this weekend but Chris, the main shucker, was so nice and made a few calls and put a class together for us for Saturday. 

The class itself was so informational and a ton of fun. Chris has such a passion for his job and it shows while he was teaching us about oysters. We learned a lot and can now shuck oysters! Thank you so much to Chris and Oyster Boy. We will definitely be returning the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The thyme out drink was, clean and summery.  The oysters were nice, the best being the caraquette.  Yummy with lots of flavor but not too fishy."}
{"text":"Great oysters here! We tried the 3 varieties of baked oysters and a bunch of the raw ones.  I really loved the baked cheese and creamy sauces on the baked oysters but my fiance was not as much a fan of the baked ones.
We also ordered the spinach dip w/ bay scallops - it was really good and a generous portion size as well. I couldn't get enough of the crostini it came with for dipping.
The halibut entree was bleh, we were regretful of that decision and next time will probably only come back to munch on oysters and have a few drinks!
The service was a bit slow - we actually waited for half an hour for our bill only to end up taking it to the cash register at the bar to pay anyway."}
{"text":"I am impressed with their wide selection of oysters. We started with a dozen raw and the waitress suggested we do a variety. We had three different kinds, four of each ( obviously). They we magnificent! We sat at the bar, the place was packed. It was great because we could watch the oysters being shucked. We then enjoyed their deep fried oysters! Delicious! This was followed up with an order of fish and chips which is very generous in it's portions. Definitely one order is substantial enough to share. 

I will be going back.

The place has a great energy. I totally relaxed after a hectic week and we enjoyed our food and our conversation. And as I looked around I could see it was the same for everyone in there. 

The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and want to ensure you are enjoying the experience."}
{"text":"Brilliant from start to finish! 

Silly me forgot to make reservations for my birthday, but they had plenty of space to accommodate my party of 3 at the bar. Turned out that's the best place to sit, because we met Chris aka OG (Oyster Guy) extraordinaire! Not knowing much about Oysters, he  was amazing at breaking down the flavour profiles of the different varieties. I'm not an Oyster aficionado, so I resigned myself to his expertise and was so glad that I did!

I started with some Caraquettes and transitioned into some Honeysuckles, and  beauties from BC. A mild home brewed hot sauce, Mignonette, and Cocktail Sauce accompanied the platters along with a lovely mound of FRESH grated Horseradish. Holy heck does fresh make a difference! Soooo good! 

They were incredibly accommodating of my gluten free diet, and were quick to point out the things they could modify. 

My mom had the Seafood Chowder, and the smell was intoxicating. She said that she wished I could eat gluten, because this was the best chowder she'd had anywhere! For a split second, I was considering it! They also enjoyed the baked Oysters which came topped with cheese, white sauce, and breadcrumbs.

The Bouillabaise was phenomenal. Deep, rich seafoody flavour accompanied by a plethora of shellfish, mollusks, and a filet of seared salmon. Just beautifully done!

My dad had the Halibut Fish and Chips and he was a happy camper. 

The winner of the night was the Halibut accompanied by a Sweet Potato and Bacon hash. Lord have mercy, that hash was to die for. They had these cubes of bacon that were perfectly crisped, and just melted in your mouth #NOM! The fish was beautifully grilled, and succulent. One of the best dishes I've had in Toronto within the last year hands down!

I am so glad to have discovered Oyster Boy on my birthday. It easily tops my list as one of my favourite restaurants in the city, and I can't wait to return over and over and over again! 

Oh, and did I mention that they presented me with an Oyster Girl shirt at the end of our meal because it was my birthday? Ya, see that, it's the little things that count, and they were totally owning it!

Special shout out to Kendall and Chris aka OG for making this such a special evening :D"}
{"text":"What a cool place!

I can't even say I'm a huge fan oysters.... Lets be honest, despite being fairly tasty they look kind of gross and I end up tasting more of what I put on it (including a salsa, hot sauce and a mango chutney-ish thing as well as grated horse radish!) then the actual oyster. However, I'd say this is one of those places that is about the dining experiences as well as the actual food.

Servers are knowledgeable and oysters are definitely fresh and tasty. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something a bit different to do for a light dinner. However, I would caution anyone looking for a big meal - while delicious, the oysters are fairly pricey and with a bottle of wine or two the bill was definitely on the expensive side."}
{"text":"My favourite place for oysters in Toronto hands down!

Great selection of oysters from both the east and west coast. The oyster shucker comes over to the table and in great detail explains all the different sizes and flavours.
Service is always friendly and never overwhelming so if it is your first time having oysters you will comfortable ordering.

The place is small but a very cozy atmosphere. Make sure to make reservations!

Will continue to return :)"}

Amazing staff
Fresh seafood  
One of the best restaurant I did
The bouillabaisse  was awesome and the rouille was perfect .
The rockfeller oysters were succulent"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and we both had a great time. I called minutes before we arrived to make sure they had a table and they were able to accommodate us even though the place was jumping. Pretty lucky for a Friday night!

Our oysters were nice and fresh and came with the usual toppings. They offer many different types of oysters and will take the time to explain them all. My chowder was good and creamy with plenty of seafood chunks and flavour. The mussel entree was also very good and I made sure to order some frites on the side to mop up the delicious broth.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Whenever I have an intense craving for oysters, this is the place. 

I always start with oysters+beer and finish with oysters so hardly get a chance to try their main dishes. Maybe I tried once, but it was not very impressive, I guess. So I always have oysters all the way.

Oysters are super fresh and I love their skinny fries too. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here with my fiance on a Friday night, we arrived without a reservation and had to wait ~20 minutes for a table. It was no biggie since Nadege is 1 minute away (a delicious bakery you HAVE to try). They also took my phone number down so that they could call when the table was ready.

Ambience: We sat at the bar and saw all the oyster shucking in action. The place has dim lighting, was on noisy side and definitely crowded (I could easily hear the conversations beside me). 

There's a map showing the locations of all the oysters which was fun to learn. There are lots of interesting posters on the walls. 

Food: Oysters were fresh and shucked well, there was a good variety. I like mine with a bit of lemon and horseradish. We got 2 of 7 different types, some raw clams and reordered a half dozen of our favourite (kumamoto). We also ordered fish and chips - nothing memorable.

Service: Before the meal: great. During the meal: average.

Oyster Boy was A-ok. Perhaps if I had better seating at a table instead of the bar I would of had a better experience."}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try last week, after passing by many times! Our server was fantastic at helping us pick a variety of oysters to try. 

I had the watermelon crab salad, which was delicious. A little small for the price but beautifully plated. My boyfriend had the fish and chips and said it was delicious, as well. 

Overall a little pricey, but great service and atmosphere. I would come back here to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Worst.  Service. Ever.

Went there with friends and had the worst service of my life.  I have been a big fan of rodneys in toronto and joe beef in montreal so I appreciate that an oyster bar is a far more relaxed service environment but this was offensive.  Our server acted too busy to help us from the beginning.  When we asked what kind of beer they had, she responded \"can no one here read?\"  pointed to the menu and said she would come back in a minute.  she then repeated her statement to someone who came five minutes late.  the service went downhill from there.

She  rushed us through our oyster selection and main courses.  Told us we were taking a really long time and that we should hurry up if we want to be able to order dessert. We encountered a few bad oysters that were spit out and no one wanted to discuss it with our server because of how rude she was being.  It was incredible!  

I was extremely embarrassed to have suggested this place to my friends and will not make the mistake again.  I strongly suggest Rodneys on King instead.  The prices are almost identical and was worlds apart in terms of service and oyster knowledge."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of oysters.  In fact, this was my last official non-vegetarian meal before going full vegan.  So why this place?  I didn't feel like eating meat, this is my sister's favourite restaurant, and if I'm gonna have seafood for my 'last meal' I'm gonna enjoy it at the Best seafood joint in town.  

As a former server, I have to say, the service was impeccable.  Our server was attentive, genuine, and very willing to answer my questions ... and I had a LOT of 'em.
Even the chef stopped by our table to answer a question I had about the chow chow (see below).

I was in a celebratory mood so we ordered a lot more than I normally would and my sis and I shared.

BEVY
It was our luck that they just added sake to their menu.  I'm not a big drinker but it was recommended that we try the sake and I have to say this was the best sake I've ever had - Kimoto Junmai Sake.

APPIES
2 types of oysters: St Simone from Shippagan, NB and Beach Angels from Quadra Island, BC.  Both super fresh and quite tasty considering I generally don't eat oysters (it has more to do with the way they look than the way they taste).  My sis eats them without the sauces and I tried all 3, which were all yummy.

Ceviche with sturgeon - a wonderful texture, crisp flavour and I enjoyed the presentation.

Crab cakes - I've tried a lot of crab cakes in the past couple years and these are hands down the freshest and tastiest ones I've ever had.  The blend of flavours and accompanying chow chow (housemade relish) & slaw could have made this almost a mini-meal in itself... if i wasn't so hungry.

After all those appies, we decided to go with one main to share so that we could have room for their perfectly crispy shoestring fries with chipotle mayo.

The Bouillabaisse came with the freshest halibut, clams, mussels and juicy jumbo shrimp. The broth was so tasty we had to order more bread for dipping.

We were fortunate to get there right at opening (5pm) cuz as we were leaving, the place started to fill up very quickly.  I'd highly recommend making a reservation - it's no wonder this place gets packed.  

Definitely a memorable visit and since I'm no longer eating seafood I'll have to live vicariously through all the other Oyster Boy lovers out there."}
{"text":"I'm a big oyster fan. And really, in Toronto, there are only 2 places to get Oysters in the city, here and Rodney's. I'd have to say the oysters and service are right on par with each other. Both are fresh, both are served by fun waiters and waitresses who are, or look, somewhat overworked, but manage to get the job done. 
What I like about Oyster Boy is the other menu, which is a little less expensive and a little more 'roadhouse' than the more upscale Rodney's, which has a broader more diverse menu. 
Tonight I had a couple dozen oysters, which were as good as oysters get, as well as a nice caesar salad, with some fragrant smoked trout and onion rings, which probably were the best onion rings I've had in a long time, if ever. 
Only two staff on tonight, but they managed to keep a busy place sane and comfortable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tried the oysters Rockafeller ($18 for 6), chowder ($11), seafood pasta with a white sauce ($25), and a side of Brussel sprouts with bacon ($9) . Overall, it's was quite an expensive meal for a fairly \"meh\" reaction to all the food (especially the undercooked Brussel sprouts). 

Not sure I'd go back unless just for a glass of wine and some raw oysters as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Love OB. My son (he's nine) have enjoyed going here for years. Great food and service. Very friendly always, my son lives it there., as do I!"}
{"text":"Consistently some of the worst service in the city. We went in tonight as a party of 5, and had one more friend drop by for a beer. We ordered 100 bucks worth of wine and 100+ bucks worth of oysters. The server was rude right from the get go, showing obvious frustration when she got to the table and we weren't ready to order. She rolled her eyes at us multiple times throughout the night. When I asked her what the best thing on the menu was, she said one word, everything. She forgot to bring waters to the table. She brought all the food out at the same time, apart from one persons main which came out 25 mins after they had already cleared the table, with no apology or explanation. There was no mention on the menu re: grat, but when she brought the bill, she informed the table that she tacked on 20% as that's the policy for \"large groups\". Wtf, since when was 5 considered a large group? Since when did restaurants charge auto grat without putting it in writing on the menu? Screw this place and their terrible staff.  I've gotten better customer service from a hot dog vendor. The sad part is the food is always good, but front of house is always too good for their customers."}
{"text":"Called and called and called never got an call back to let me know if
my reservation had been booked.......thanks guys....usually this signals the end of an era
glad to see it go bankrupt sometime in the future......time to move on....so we went to 
\"The one that got away\" at King and Portland.   Thx Oyster boy!... never would have found this great place if it wasn't for your shitty service!"}
{"text":"A delicious meal and wonderful night! We tried multiple things off the menu and were fans of it all. Standouts are the baked oysters, fish tacos, and ceviche. Lovely, friendly service and excellent food, I have already been recommending it to others."}
{"text":"Make a reservation or you might wait 45 minutes, which I didn't mind at first while drinking a Mill St. Organic while watching the crowd, inside and out. But after 4 tables sat open for 15 minutes, ostensibly waiting for reservations, I was a little peeved at the attitude of the host. He was a little snippy when we sat down too, he alone cost a star or it would have been 5 because our food and server were both excellent.

The oysters are great, fresh, not too pricey, with many options.

For dinner, my mate devoured the fish and chips and I was very happy with mussels in a beer and spices broth.

We started with a fresh salad made with field greens, goat cheese, and beets, a standard dish but done really well."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Oyster Boy, the service is terrible but the food is amazing.

One time they spilled my drink on me and never offered me an apology, let along think to bring me a replacement.

Another time they served the people after my group before us, and when we asked them when our meal was, they said there was a big group that came in before us and the couple that came in after us ordered something that was faster to make. Even if they were right, the server by no means tried to make us feel at ease.

The food on the other hand as I mentioned, has always been amazing. I love their oysters as well as their clam chowder, and every time I've gone there I've ordered them. I just stopped going there as I got tired of the terrible service."}
{"text":"As a native from the west coast, Oyster Boy is the only place that can satisfy my need for fresh oysters.  On top of the perfect selection of oysters they offer, everything else was delicious too.   I've been a few times with small and large groups of people, and never has there been one person who said their meal was less than fantastic.  

Their menu isn't pages long, or intimidating, yet has enough to choose from so that everyone can find something they want to try.  

Presentation of the food was beautiful, and it came out in a timely fashion. Attention from staff was just enough that we didn't feel neglected, and we weren't bothered every 5 minutes.  That's something I always appreciate.   

If you want something intimate, lively and unpretentious, give this place a go.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've never been mad for mollusks and so when I was dragged here kicking and screaming like an infant, I didn't think I'd enjoy myself (or eat anything!). I was wrong as per usual. Oyster Boy is a lil hole in the wall, but it has huge personality and it knows its oysters. In fact, it's THE go-to place for oysters in Toronto...as I had been told (but had previously ignored) and soon discovered for myself.

I've always had an aversion to these slimy suckers, but the staff does the shucking for you, while offering up explanations and tossing away the bad boys. Their knowledge of oysters is truly legit. Their assistance also makes the situation a little more comfortable if you're new this sort of dining experience. Luckily for me, I caught on quick and started to develop a palate for the raw kind. Or, perhaps I had just tricked myself into believing I loved it all because oysters are known as aphrodisiacs (dot dot dot).

To sum it up, this place is aces and I'll definitely go back to try out some other fan favourites, like clams, marinated calamari, and beer battered fish oh my!- or shall I say, oh Oyster Boy!"}
{"text":"I really need to call in and make sure restaurants that serve my favorite oysters actually have them available on the night of my visit! Oyster Boy sadly only had few choices left when I came here for dinner last week... I missed out on the kunamotos again! 

We were seated by the bar since we had no reservation, which was fine because we received fast service... Or so I thought.. 

Our oyster came pretty fast however it took forever for our entrees to arrive. The bartender probably noticed my stomach grumbling so he offered us complimentary oysters. My tummy was making a racket.. 

The entrees (when they finally arrived) were delicious! The halibut was so fresh and tender and complemented very well with the bacon mash. The fish and chips were also delicious but the fish was a little tough. 

Don't be confused by the dark ambience - we thought they weren't even open! It's just another one of those dark restaurants, so don't be fooled!"}
{"text":"i love oyster boy i go at least once a month with my friends...it is so good all the time and we always have so much fun :)
mmm -lobster, fish tacos, the ceasar! and this incredible pasta i had the last time i was there ...and the oysters are always good  
it can end up being a tad expensive but its totally worth it"}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff really do know their Oysters and were really helpful in helping us understand the difference between each type of Oyster. We went there for Shucking Class and Chris was absolutely amazing! He taught us everything we needed to know about Oysters and now we are shucking experts! Will definitely be back for dinners and all our other Oyster needs."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, and both times were wonderful!  It's a small restaurant, and you are welcomed by a nice fishy smell, friendly staff and interesting seafood themed decor!

Lots of oyster options to choose from, and if you don't know what you want, ask the oyster shucker or server and they will guide you through it and even offer a sample plate!  The seafood chowder and deep fried oysters are also super yummy and in good sized portions!  Tonight they had honey glazed Brussels sprouts on their special menu and they were to die for!

I wish the place was a bit bigger though, because I do feel squished sometimes, especially when you need some space to eat shellfish!  Even between tables, it's very narrow and two people can't walk through side by side at the same time.

Come here early or make reservations as this place gets packed!"}
{"text":"Been back several more times and I'm sticking to my initial review about the size of this place cause unfortunately got hit with another overly perfumed neighbor. I must say though, if you want to try some of the most delicious smaller oysters- aka Shigoku's then you must head over here during the fall. There seems to be a varying selection here each time I come unlike other popular oyster bars which have opted for a fixed selection which does not include many truly large oysters. I decided to try something other than oysters last week and fell in love with their duck breast w. Mushroom risotto and blueberry sauce...I'm an oyster lover, but their breast was good enough that I passed on oysters after I tried one bite. They had a salad with greens, thick cut bacon pieces, eggs, blue cheese, cranberries and smoked fish which was lightly dressed. The salad made my top 10 salad list. One warning though-if you are short (I'm short at less than 5'3\") you should get a booth. Their other chairs are not comfy for shorties"}
{"text":"We were going to an art show just down the street so Oyster Boy seemed like a logical dinner choice.  Also, the large smiling oyster wearing a hat was calling my name.  (I just checked out the website.  The \"boy\" himself does not have an oyster-shaped head.  Same smile though.)

We could barely fit in the door.  Not because we were too big or the door was too small, but because the place was packed.  I was ready to give up even before asking for a table when we were offered two spots at the bar, right away.  We'll take it!

It turns out I like the side-by-side seating at a bar for conversation.  It only works when you're a party of 2, but it sure beats sitting across a table gazing awkwardly into each other's eyes and it's much easier to exchange words.  Oyster Boy was fairly noisy so I'm not sure I would have bothered to make conversation had we been sitting elsewhere.

Not an extensive menu.  They do what they do well (seafood) and don't mess with anything else.  I had trouble deciding what to order and I think the waiter was getting impatient so he recommended the fish and chips.  I couldn't NOT order oysters... we're at Oyster Boy!  Luckily, my date offered to share his oysters with me.  (I hear they're an aphrodisiac...)

I was extremely satisfied with both the oysters and my fish and chips.  The fish and chips portion was huge.  I was very impressed with the level of service, especially considering how busy they were.  Being at the bar it's hard for the waiter to not be in your face, but we weren't bothered too often and had no trouble getting his attention when required.

If you can snag a seat here, I highly recommend you take it."}
{"text":"Having eaten oysters from Bordeaux to Brisbane, I think there is nothing like a tasty little malpeque or one of its friends from PEI, and Oyster Boy shucks 'n' serves 'em like they were just washed up to your table on a nice chilly wave.   After many visits over many years, I find that Oyster Boy just keeps on getting better.   The rest of the menu aint bad either, and although the place is almost always a little too cosy, for the world's best oysters'n' onion rings washed down with a deliciously crisp bottle of plonk de blanc, Oyster Boy is impossible to beat."}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago just for the oysters on a packed Saturday evening and although it was really busy, and didn't have a reservation we were seated in reasonable time. The seats we got were right in front of the shucker who was really friendly and recommended some fantastic oysters. 

The oysters and the made-from-scratch condiments to go with them were fresh and delectable.

{"text":"This place never fails to satisfy! They have a new menu item, the soft shell crab, where somehow the breading manages to taste like fish roe, amazinggg. The oysters came fast, and expertly shucked. Paired with steam whistle, what's not to love! Rockefellers are always a satisfying one, and the seafood risotto had the best charred baby tomatoes I ever had."}
{"text":"Officially my favourite oyster bar in Toronto! Love the quick and friendly service and the decor - felt like I was eating at a seafood place by the ocean.  They have a great selection of fresh oysters - definitely ask your server for recommendations depending how you like your oysters.  We had a dozen of oysters, ceviche, seafood chowder and steamed lobster.  The chowder was tasty, but filled our stomachs quickly, so we felt quite full.  The steamed lobster was just DELICIOUS! So sweet and juicy, I would definitely recommend, especially for the price! The one thing I regret is not ordering more oysters!!"}
{"text":"If I could I'd come and eat raw oysters on the half shell here all day every day.  Heaven.  Even their condiments they make to accompany the oysters are superior to any other restaurants I've had oysters in.  I've tried several different places now, and that does not by any account make me an expert, but I am a diehard fan thanks to Oyster Boy.  I've also eaten off the kitchen menu and it's pretty fantastic as well, but I'd rather save up my appetite for eating all the oysters.  If only they were cheaper, this would be my favourite place in all the world, it still might be."}
{"text":"We came here to feast - and boy did we feast.

First off - I'm not a fan of oysters or clams or mussels. So I didn't really try those, and won't even comment.

With that said, we got pretty much everything else on the menu. The pasta was delicious. The lobster mac n cheese was solid. The crab was delicious. The deep fried oysters were pretty damn delicious. Hell, even the fries were solid.

It's a reliable and delicious place to get a ton of seafood done right. I may give it more of a 3.5/5, but if I had to hedge, I'd give it a 4."}
{"text":"THE best place for oysters I've ever found. It's simply incredible. Get there early on the weekends because it is small and they fill up quick."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to visit Oyster Boy for a long time because I love oysters and I finally had an opportunity. 

The atmosphere was good and I was also satisfied with the service we received. To start with, I ordered some oysters (black point) which were not really the best in town. Then I got mussels which were fresh but did not have a lot of flavour in them. After some time I ordered shrimps on a skewer which were cold when they reached the table (the presentation also was not the best). 

Finally, my friends ordered fish and chips which I obviously tried as well. Now, the fries did not taste bad, but they were really really tiny - the question is why? The worst part was the fish. Even though it had a very tasty coating (batter) with a beautiful texture I still cannot get over the fact that they use frozen fish. It lost all its natural flavour and was so hard to chew. Please, please, please, ask you chef to try it. You have a lot of potential but this time I was truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place. Very engaged and attentive staff who really know their product and really want you to enjoy the experience.
Funky small friendly younger crowd place.
The best tastiest (did I say tastiest?) oysters fresh fresh fresh and great condiments.
To the person who complained about slow service, you didn't have a reservation so maybe you should do so next time :)
Reasonable, 18 oysters, two seafood burgers coffee tea with tax and a good tip $100 for two!
I'll be back!
I wish they still had Teeshirts with the old logo though :("}
{"text":"I love this places love for their product - Oysters! The staff seems pumped to tell you about what oysters they have in and like to help you figure out what one would be the best for you. There's a good atomosphere, the prices are great, and everything I've had off the menu that wasn't oysters was also made with love. My go-to in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My fiancÃ© and I went to Oyster Boy last night (Sunday Feb 15th 2015) and we had an amazing time. We got there around 7pm and luckily managed to secure two seat at the bar. It was our first time there, and the restaurant was packed! We were very happy to be at the bar though, and enjoyed watching the man that shucks the oysters. He was so funny, nice, and super informative. As soon as we were ordering, we explained we had never had raw oysters, only baked Rockefeller oysters once. And our server, was super sweet & also informative lady with short blonde hair. She brought us two smaller St simon oysters to start, while our Rockefeller, Rustico, & Royale oysters we're baking. They were all delicious!!! So we kept doing six raw, then six baked, a few times, and the oyster shucker guy kept coming over and telling us all about the oysters, what they fed on, What breeds they were etc. it was such a good time! We tried many varieties of raw,  
Valentine's 
Black pearls
Kusshi 
St simon 
Caraquette
Wiley point 
Our favorites were absolutely the Valentine's, St Simon, & Wiley Point. 
We also ordered the crab cakes, the cakes themselves are really nice, loads of crab & not a lot of filler like most, good crispy coating. However I like a creamy sauce, not so much the sweet onion chutney. But that wouldn't stop me from going again! Next time we want to try the crab dip that everyone seemed to rave about as well. The owner, (I'm guessing) was who seated us, & greater everyone at the door, was also super nice and friendly. By the end of our visit he had overheard we had just gotten engaged Friday the 13th of February & he gave us both a free toque with the logo on it! And on a -24c night, we were so grateful! 

We can not wait to go back for an ice cold Sapporo & a ton of raw & baked oysters. Looking forward to trying the fried oysters & crab dip."}
{"text":"I find the service to be horrendous. The gentleman behind the bar didn't know price and WAS IMPATIENT AND ...TO MY STANDARDS RUDE.

whether the venue is packed or not ....service is on the menu.

...oh and answer your phone!!! We called and couldn't get through ...we're now sitting here and the phone is ringing off the hook...

Hello ....

Ok...just finished eating ....I truly enjoyed the oysters and rhetoric muscles ....phenomenal ...makes up for the grumpy service I had earlier ...keep the old guy behind the bar and preferably NOT talking ...everyone else was super friendly !!!!"}
{"text":"Nice, pleasant experience but probably wouldn't go back.  I had way more delicious oysters at Geraldine just a week prior, and the oysters that the waitress suggested for me fell flat compared to what I described (I like a big, meaty oyster).  The slider trio was pretty pedestrian, which was sad -- the bun was all wrong, the sauces boring.  

I almost want to give it two stars, just because it really wasn't anything at all special or unique, but it does have a certain \"je ne sais pas\" that I can't deny."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. First I suggest you try the raw oysters. ..The variety of sauces are tasty and allows each oyster to have a new flavor.  Second,  enjoy the great variety of drinks.  Third, well the fish and chips and every single appetizer is great."}
{"text":"Sweet god in heaven I love this place. I was here a few weeks ago and shut down the Oyster Boy one night with some friends who live in Toronto and go there pretty regularly.  First off, the people working there are the best -- incredibly friendly, knowledgable about food and wine, and very tolerant of our drunken group that wouldn't leave the restaurant until very late.  Great crab cakes, great fish tacos, and I presume great oysters (my pals ate them, I did not) and, yes, even a great steak."}
{"text":"I suggest you definitely check out Oyster Boy if you haven't already. Drinks, food, ambiance, staff were AMAZING! I thought we were only going for a few drinks but ended up staying for 50 oysters mac and cheese, and fried oysters because of the friendly staff. I can't  talk enough about how much Murphy really stole our heart and the other girl with the cute short blonde hair... didn't get her name though! Such a nice and attentive staff. I would 100% recommend this place to everyone I know! Thanks Guys for a memorable night! You guys are the best xo"}
{"text":"Great dining experience! Oysters were fresh,  and server did a great job explaining the different types.  Ceviche was delicious,  and seafood grill plate was awsome but a little pricey for what you get.  Overall a good casual spot for great seafood!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner last night at Oyster Boy. Probably some of the nicest oysters I've had in a long time. Our awesome server recommended the St. Simon which were meaty and had a nice savoury and sweet flavour profile. She also recommended the Valentine, which were from the west coast and really really delicious. Overall, they oysters were the highlight of the meal. The wine list has some perfect pairings, too.

The rest of the food was good, but we found most of it to be under seasoned.

The Onion rings were thick cut, huge and super crispy, but they needed some more flavour. The fish tacos were also a good size, but the only identifiable flavour was chipotle until I got to a bit of cilantro. The fish was fresh and tender, but again, the seasoning wasn't there.

Crab cakes were much the same.

Don't get me wrong-- everything was fresh, which is what you want when you're having seafood, but definitely missing some zip.

The beet marinated scallop ceviche was wonderful. Great presentation and the subtle flavour of beet and lime shone through.

I would absolutely come back to Oyster Boy for the raw stuff. They did an excellent job. If I was watching my sodium, I may have given them five stars, but for now, I'll leave it at a solid 4 and look forward to some more tasty oysters and white wine from the Loire Valley in the near future."}
{"text":"A nice place to grab a meal (good fi'n'chi) but I mostly come here for takeout oysters. Always great selection and reasonable service with fair prices. Would be very sad to ever see this place go - a rational criteria for a 4-star rating.

I also appreciate that they are active in the community. Also - great graphic design choices!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here but it's gone down recently and it made me really anxious the last 3 times I've been. Three times I caught the waitress re-using other customers sauces. That is disgusting. Really? Why so frugal when Oyster Boy is clearly printing money from this place. I couldn't believe it. It's just simply not sanitary to re-use the Oyster sauce (I would understand if I had asked for more -- but this was a case of the waitress taking dishes back and keeping the sauces behind and adding more and then handing it out. Just - disgusting. Also, the stuck up customer service - priceless. Rude -"}
{"text":"The oysters here are incredible, 100% worth the price. The atmosphere and interior design are great and the serve staff is very knowledgeable and attentive. I had oysters, a Cesar salad, mussels and flan - every course was fantastic. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After trying to find a place to eat in Queen West on a Saturday night, during prime time, my friend and I finally settled on Oyster Boy and it was definitely a great decision. 

The place was pretty packed at about 8:30pm, but there were two empty spots left at the bar. Servers were super friendly and let us know when a table was free, although we were pretty comfy at the bar, so we just decided to stay put. We ordered a couple rounds of wine, raw oysters, and baked oysters that night. 

I don't completely recall all of the raw oysters we had that night, but our server was super helpful and let us know which ones tasted like what and what size they were, and how meaty they were, and how they were in terms of texture. My favorites were the beach angels from BC, but I don't remember any of the others ones that we had.

As for the baked oysters, they were AWESOME. The Royale was my favorite since it had crab on the top, but the Rustico followed closely behind. The Gruyere on the top was a great touch. I also liked the Rockerfeller- the fennel in it didn't have that licorice flavor so I ate a bunch of them. We also had the frites with curry sauce. The curry sauce was sooo good! 

I will definitely be back. I loved the food and the staff at Oyster Boy and the place was super cute."}
{"text":"my very favourite oyster place.  it's a small place, but they have a great selection.  Go only with a small group- it's hard to get a comfortable reservation ofr a large party.  Ther servers are super friendly and I highly reccommend you order cases if you are having a party.  they are super affordable and if you sit down at the oyster bar they will go through the different types and help you decide on which one to pick.  I'm a huge fan of this place, and just outside of bellwoods trinity park its a great location to go for a stroll after supper."}
{"text":"Who ever thought that oysters and gazpacho for brekkie wasn't good had better make it over to Oyster Boy!!

Had the MOST fantastic brunch ever. Really good. Great friendly attentive servers."}
{"text":"Overall: 4.5/5 
Best oysters in town! Mains also hold up and customer service is top notch. A solid place to visit if you're in the area and feeling up for seafood. 

Taste: 4/5
Came here for the oysters - we ended up getting 2 dozen and asked the staff to surprise us with the selection. Everything he chose was AWESOME! Top quality, fresh oysters...who can say no to that? Oysters are served alongside 3 different sauces and I enjoyed the wine flavour one the most. We also ordered a few other items off the menu - crab and scallop pasta, lobster mac and cheese, fish tacos, fries with jalapeÃ±o lime mayo, and a seafood chowder. I was initially really skeptical about the menu items at first and honestly thought that everything would be super basic but WHAM! I was wrong. I love when I'm pleasantly surprised by things :) Mains definitely hold up - I really enjoyed my fish tacos! Lobster mac and cheese had a good portion of lobster in it, worth the $$. 

Service: 4.5/5
Oyster Boy embodies what excellent service looks like! Staff were extremely personable, taking the time to chat and joke with our group. Service was quick and efficient. My friend liked the oyster crackers that the soup came with and the server gave us a couple more packets of these to-go. 

Tips
- I heard it gets packed quite quickly so be sure to call and RSVP
- You can order oysters (shucked!) to go. I overheard someone call in for 5 dozen oysters! 
- Their Caesar is pretty bomb"}
{"text":"Excellent service, all staff was engaged and pleasant. They made it a memorable experience for my husband and I (first time visitors to Toronto). Food was fresh - we got a mix of raw and baked oyster platters. The lobster mac-n-cheese was delicious! Will definitely come back to Oyster Boy!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for my last night in Toronto.  It was great and the food was fresh and exactly what I expected.  Nothing too over-the-top or spectacular but I was satisfied."}
{"text":"A visit to Toronto isn't complete without a delicious feast at Oyster Boy!

We made reservations for 9 people but it ended up only being 6. The staff were amazing, knowledgeable and totally cool with the last minute changes. Being a bigger group we were able to order a good selection and share (too many yummy dishes to choose just one). My personal faves were the fish tacos and of course the oysters. Oh and this killer salad with fish, forget the name. We were talking about it for days..."}
{"text":"Until recently I was an oyster virgin, so once I had plucked up the courage to pop that cherry I needed to dine at Oyster Boy.

Friday night and this place was busy! It is bright, clean and fresh. My only complaint is that the tables are tight together and I imagine it could get pretty loud in here!

Our group had oysters to start, I loved the accompaniments which included horseradish, lemon, red wine and shallot, ginger hot sauce (house made and was my favourite) and seafood sauce. Each table is set with the obligatory hot sauce. We did get carried away and ordered alot!

I had the grilled char which was fantastic and cooked to perfection. My friends had the fish tacos which I want to try at some point. 

All the main courses looked lovely. 

Our bill was expensive which left me thinking it was pricey, but then in context we got so carried away that we ordered about 2 dozen oysters and then some!

I will definitely return, loved the experience and the food!"}
{"text":"Back to Oyster Boy again last night for oysters and beer. All three varieties they have in stock at the moment are great. Quick squeeze of lemon and you're good to go. 

Service has always been good for us, so no complaints. 

Reservations on a weekend are essential."}
{"text":"I truly appreciate fresh seafood. Nothing can be fresher than a raw, uncooked oyster. It should taste like the sea, salty and briney. 

This was my experience at Oyster Boy. Strolling in after a dinner at the County General, I craved oysters! I made the mistake of ordering 6 fried oysters- forgot which kind. The coating was too thick, corn mealy and took away from the fresh oyster inside. 85% coating, 15% oyster. I will order raw oysters next time.
My buddy had baked oysters with cheese and spinach, they tasted much better than the fried. 

Service was good, nice people that had the passion for serving fresh seafood.
I wasn't able to try more of the menu since full, but everything looked and sounded appetizing.

Overall, a tavern feeling restaurant. Good seafood, best served non-fried and with a bit of lemon! Prices are O.K. a bit more expensive than other places but cheaper than other more popular stops."}
{"text":"Oyster Boy has - you guessed it - great oysters. Also, great fries, and really hospitable, friendly service.

I like oysters a lot, so I don't personally have a lot to say about the non- oyster dishes (I'm pretty easy to please at this place - I go in, order a bunch of oysters and some wine, and leave very, very happy), but I've gone there with people who don't like or are indifferent to oysters, and they've been really happy with their meals. The fish and chips are particularly good. 

This is one of my favourite places in Toronto. I ordered oysters here for my wedding. Reservations aren't strictly necessary - they're happy to seat you at the bar if they're full - but are  helpful especially on weekends because it's a small restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband was excited to eat at Oyster Boys after reading that they had great seafood. We got one dozen oysters, their seafood chowder, crab cakes, and honey roasted brussel sprouts. 

Oysters arrived shortly after they were ordered and was served with a red wine sauce, spicy sauce, cocktail sauce, lemon, and fresh horseradish. I was hoping for more creative sauces for a place that specializes in oysters, but they did the job. Oysters were fresh and the husband enjoyed them. There were a few pieces of shell in our oysters.

The other dishes was so incredibly underwhelming that it was almost unpleasant to eat. The seafood chowder was thick, but it wasn't creamy like a traditional chowder. The flavour also wasn't quite right; like they added something that didn't belong. We thought Red Lobster clam chowder was way better. The crab cakes weren't good at all. Served with coleslaw, pickled red onion, and mayo. I can't tell if the crab cakes were fried or baked because the texture was mushy throughout. The battered outside didn't add any crunch to them and the flavour was bland and uninspiring. The brussel sprouts were actually my favourite part of our meal and they didn't taste like they were honey roasted at all. Just cooked nicely. 

Service, while friendly and casual, wasn't really existent. We weren't offered water because we ordered drinks, but shouldn't water come by default? We were never checked upon at any point of our meal, otherwise we would have been honest with them. We begrudgingly ate our food and left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I liked the service, it was friendly, fast, checking on us constantly, and the waitress changed our plates and cutlery after our first courses.

I liked the set up and decoration: casual, cozy, with delicate open sea accents, and enough space in between the tables.

If you attend during weekend try to make a reservation. We reached the last table, but I would like to seat on the bar, have a glass of wine while contemplating how they open, serve, and organize the oysters and seafood (free show).

We started our late lunch/early dinner with some mussels, onion rings, and Rockefeller oysters.

Those mussels were the best ones I've tried in Canada. Really meaty, fresh, with excellent seasoning and preparation. They gave us some bread to soak on their juices, and trust me, it was worth to do it.

The onion rings were crunchy, perfectly shaped, but an unnecessary guilty pleasure when your main dish comes with fries...

I liked the Rockefeller oysters as well; they had enough garlic and greens which helped to balance the cheesy-heavy flavor of the sauce.

The only thing I think wasn't good in terms of price-quality-amount, was the seafood platter. Half of the platter was made of fries. It had 3 shrimps; 4 scallops with the shell that tasted kind of raw; 2 clams; one squid that was delicious and has the highlights of the whole meal, and a frozen leg of king crab which shell was bland and meat dry.

Next time I'll follow the name's suggestion and ask for oysters. Ok, and mussels. Well I also hope with all my hearth that they start selling the grilled squid by itself."}
{"text":"This place is not like your typical oyster place where it reeks of fish and seafood. It's definitely more hipster than those joints, but still fresh. It's a charming place for a date! 

The mussels also have a great sauce/soup fit for dipping your fries! 

I believe you can also learn how to shuck here!"}
{"text":"Starting off by saying this place serves lots of varieties of oysters! Well yeah, the name speaks for itself...duh. Lol OK so this is a real casual restaurant with a nice small menu catering to the seafood lovers outthere.  

My boyfriend and I started off by having a dozen oysters, we chose 6 from New Brunswick ( think called French kiss or something like that) and 6 from the USA; I can't remember the name except they were large! Both varieties were fresh and delicious. The accompanying comdiments of 3 were: in house hot sauce ( yum !!), red vinegar, and cocktail sauce. We wish we ordered 2 dozen of more varieties these oysters were so fresh and good. 
Next our mains we had were the seafood bouillabaisse and lobster mac n cheese. Both dishes super yummy. They were both about $30 each.  I didn't taste much saffron in the broth as one of the listed ingredients but the broth had a mild balanced flavor of more tomato base. The seafood was cooked perfectly with the scallops had a nice sear as well as the fish. The lobster mac n cheese was creamy, with little bits of lobster. 
Overall, I would go back to have more oysters of course, and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"4.5

service 5 stars.
i was lucky enough to be serviced ny taylor.  great service and great food goes a long way.  so happy with the food a and service will definately come back.  super satisfied."}
{"text":"Went here this weekend and they had a pretty good selection of oysters. I had several different types, most from PEI or NB. St. Simon's were really good, as well as the beach angels, which have a distinctive finish (almost metallic -- but delicious).

Prices are average and the oysters were fresh. I didn't sample any other menu items except for the oysters."}
{"text":"I wanted to treat my dad for dinner and he felt like seafood so to Oyster Boy we went. 

Whatever time you go, phone OB for a reservation... even if you plan to eat really late. Reservation-less at nine o'clock, we had to wait for a good half hour before we could even sit at the bar, which was like 2 feet away from the door. Having a regular table was double the wait. The star count has not changed since my last visit though. I'm still a fan of this place.

The seafood here is great, but the ceasar salad was a definite bust. For almost $7, the quality of the salad was not great. My dad noted that the lettuce was brown and thus not fresh. We both ordered the fish and chips and a draft beer and we were quite satisfied with our main dish. 

I'll be back ..... with a reservation, of course."}
{"text":"Amazing 2 hour oyster shucking course: \"Shuck U.\" Chris, the main oyster shucker at OB, provided this course. He gave us an in-depth history lesson on oysters, answered all our group's questions \"Are oysters really aphrodisiacs? How many do we have to eat until it works?\" and provided us 18 oysters to shuck on our own after he gave us step by step instructions!!! 

Shucking oysters is actually really easy if you learn from a pro! (No longer afraid to stab myself in the hand). Plus we each got to eat 18 oysters which was very pleasant. 

$55, one of the best courses I've attended :)

Yay to my new skill!"}
{"text":"this is hard one for me..
I LOVED their selection of oysters, fantastic, fresh and well picked and mixed by Meagan, our server.. so that was five stars for me...
but...
when i had my ceviche, i was so disappointed, it was soooooo sour i couldnt stomach it.. and the beer battered fish and chips was good but not great..
only oysters at this place.."}
{"text":"Great experience. Great food and a warm atmosphere to go with friendly service. No complaints here."}
{"text":"This was stop 4 of our 7 for our restaurant hopping adventure. It wasn't too busy and yet the service was slow. The owner (i think) greeted us but after that went and sat down at the bar with a friend and chatted for the rest of the time we were there. 

We ordered oysters, raw and fried, and a beer. The later never came and as I asked for the bill our server asked if we still wanted it... didn't make sense at that point. 

The fried oysters were delicious, the coating was crispy and was flavored well and it came with a nice horseradish dip. The raw ones came with 3 sauces including red wine vinegar, banana peppers and cocktail sauce. 

Overall the good food didn't over ride the meh service, except the gentleman responsible for the oysters. He was friendly and informative and stopped by to pick up our dishes and told us some cool information on oyster shells. 

I probably wouldn't go back unless i was craving seafood and in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"absolutely love this place, all oysters are amazing with great recommendations from the staffs."}
{"text":"This place is always good. I have to confess, everytime I come, it's for oysters only. Sometimes I get something else in addition to the oysters, and that's always been good, but it's about the oysters. What else have I had? Salad with smoked fish, I think. Fries, definitely. Other stuff? I don't really remember. But I do remember the oysters. Always good, always fresh, always served by knowledgeable and friendly staff. They usually have a nice variety from PEI, Eastern, Western Canada and the U.S. and the servers make good recommendations.

Extra tip - they will sell you boxes or bags of oysters to bring home and shuck yourself. Or, for a little more cashola, they'll shuck and ice them for you to take home. We've bought a box once in a while for a party and shucked them at the party and they've been really great. As long as you keep 'em cold, they'll last.

Oyster Boy is a great place, with good food and service, and a laid back vibe. I am glad to live nearby."}
{"text":"Oyster Boy...oh boy!
Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Oysters
Menu items: Oysters, Beer Battered Fish and Chips and Ceviche

In the heart of downtown Toronto lays a place that offers one of the best food aphrodisiacs ever! Oysters is the specialty of this niche restaurant that came to my knowledge through a friend who swears by it. Not being a fan of oysters, I decided I needed to try them at least once to give this food group a chance. Little did I know I will become one the biggest fans of the little suckers (pun intended) and will become a regular here.

The way the boy itself, Adam Colquhoun, treats this delicacy is what makes them good. To my enjoyment, and hopefully yours, oysters at Oyster Boy can be eaten raw, cooked, steamed or fried. My favourite kind are always and forever PEI's Malpeques. I usually order about a dozen of them and stick with my choice. Malpeques are actually recognized as one of the world's finest oysters with an unequalled taste, superior appearance and excellent keeping quality. So when I come to Oyster Boy, I know I am definitely in for a treat.

Besides oysters, the boy offers a variety and limited amount of seafood dishes that will compliment your oyster-eating experience very nicely. Oyster Boy's Beer Battered Fish and Chips are no exception.

Accompanied with the Oyster Boy tartar sauce and slaw, this dish is truly mouth-watering and one to check out when visiting the boy. I am not much of a heavy batter person, so I find the light texture of the deep-fried batter actually good. The fries are nothing special, but then again this is a seafood place.

Other great choices at Oyster Boy include their \"special of the day\", which are usually menu items the chef wants to test and introduce. The Ceviche, was a great choice that night. Unlike traditional Peruvian Ceviche (which is the most popular kind), this Ceviche was fused with what tasted like Mote. Mote is husked white corn kernels that have been boiled with charcoal or firewood. The kernels tend to be big and have rather chewy texture with bland taste, however when combined with lime and salt, becomes quite the dish. The Ceviche topped with some fried octopus, gave it a nice crunchy feel, which brought the whole dish together.

When visiting Oyster Boy, I would recommend you plan in advance and make a reservation. On weekends it tends to get quite busy and at times the place does not even take a walk-in given that all of its 25-30 spots might be booked for the night.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Oyster Boy catered the cocktail hour of my wedding day. The service was great and the staff was friendly. Thanks for contributing to our day!"}
{"text":"Came here with a date and the atmosphere was perfect. We sat by the bar and the staffs are super friendly. We ordered a dozen mixed oyster and loved all of it. We also got the fish and chips and the tuna dish as our main. I would highly recommend to call ahead of time for a reservation if you have more than 2 people because they do get quite busy and we were there on a Thursday. Must try ! Great place for casual dining."}
{"text":"Been here dozens of times, and it's my favourite oyster restaurant in town, bar none. The staff is ridiculously nice, and their oyster and seafood selection is incredible. If you haven't tried oysters before, sit at the bar and ask the bartender what they'd recommend based on what you're after (large & meaty, salty, sweet, etc.).

Staff is very accommodating, and when I wanted to share fish 'n' chips with my friend, they brought out an extra plate of fries for free. 

Amazing Lobster and Crab too."}
{"text":"If you LOVE fresh oysters, this is as good as it gets.

This is my favourite place in the city for fresh oysters. Large selection at great prices. They are well prepared too. No shell residue or dirt in my oysters.

If you decide to host a party, you can order a crate from them at great prices too. The shells are cleaned ahead of time, but there's no harm rinsing them a bit more before when you get home.

I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

We walked in on a sat without reservations at 7:30pm and got a seat at the bar after 30 mins of waiting. People that came after us got turned away so reservations are recommended.

I liked sitting at the bar. I was right in front of the shucker. He was very helpful in recommending types of oysters to us. He even gave us a lesson in shucking and how to tell healthy oysters from unhealthy ones based on the shell. Very informative. He was also the only shucker and worked really quickly to shuck orders. 

We ordered:

1.5 dozen of raw oysters. Cuscumpec oysters were my fave! Fresh and sweet! Second were the St. simon. It's salty to taste, but ends with a sweetness after taste. Coville bay were my least fave, but my partner really liked that one. It had a meatier texture. 

1/2 dozen of baked oysters. My fave were the royale and rockerfeller. I didn't like the rustico because it was spicy and the flavours didn't mix well in my opinion. 

PEI clams: these were ok. A bit overcooked so it tasted rubbery. The garlic and wine sauce was a bit too salty for my liking. They gave bread to dip in the sauce. 

Brussel sprout were in honey sauce. I loved it!

In speaking to the shucker, he actually offers classes to teach how to shuck oysters.  Oyster boy also sells oysters to the public! I'll definitely be back to get me some cuscumpecs for our shucking parties! 

Service was good. It was a bit slow at the end as we ordered a second plate of oysters and had to wait. The shucker was working really fast, but there were a lot of orders. In my opinion, I think it would be good to have two shuckers on busy weekends. The shucker mentioned someone didn't show up to work. The servers were all really friendly. 

The cost is comparable to other oyster joints, but there were some oysters that you can only get at oyster boy."}
{"text":"Firstly, don't think that you won't enjoy Oyster Boy if you don't dig on oysters.  Myself, I feel that if you have to eat cold, slimy naturally-occurring-grey meat, oysters are the way to go.  I think they're tasty but I can completely understand why some put them in the \"Fear Factor\" cuisine category.  Cool.  Oyster Boy has way more to offer.

A smaller-sized restaurant and well decorated in non-cheesy maritime-based decorations, the staff are keen to greet you as soon as you enter.  You can make reservations, but it's far from necessary.  If you are left stranded waiting for a table, the bar is right there with a decent wine list and local small brew company drafts that pair nicely with most-to-all of the menu options.

The seafood is truly good and reasonably priced for the amount and quality that you get.  It's all seafood with a daily special that is usually so good it doesn't require the regular menu.  Which is a shame because the regular menu rocks.  This was my first trip there:

Server:  How's the fish and chips?
Me:  Fantastic.
Server:  Yeah, the fish is tilapia, eh?

The signature obviously is the oysters and they have between three and six different varieties to choose from, every single one of them fresh.  If you ask, they'll bring you a sample plate of a dozen across all the types they have available.  One of the best vehicles for freshly shaved horseradish I've ever had."}
{"text":"Go for the oysters, but not much else.

Got 36 raw oysters, 24 baked oysters, 1 appetizer and 5 mains.

Raw oysters were decent. Fresh, but not inexpensive.

Baked oysters had a decent sauce on them.

Mains were mediocre. Too much butter. Nothing that stood out for the price."}
{"text":"Really fresh and delicious seafood. We often pick up oysters to shuck at home - such a deal - and everything we have tried in the restaurant has been great. My only issue is that their online menu is wildly incorrect... lobster Mac & cheese says $19, and then you get to the restaurant and it's $30. Actually, it shows several items as being under $20, when most are closer to $30."}
{"text":"Great food! 
Terrific oysters. We had a variety but my favourite was definitely the XL fanny bays. Lobster mac n cheese had generous portions of lobster, fish tacos were awesome. We had a side of fries... Shoestring, my fave! Coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Beyond the best place I've ever been to in Toronto. And I live here. Been coming here for years. I'm just over due. Service staff is tenured, honest, and lovely.
And, the best oysters you could ever ask for."}
{"text":"Shared a whole bunch of oysters with some friends here last night.  
They do have great selection, also a variety of sizes in their oysters.  Price range for a dozen was approx $25-40 depending on size, and they even have sizes like cocktail or choice (which are smaller than small.

They serve them with lemon, fresh grated horseradish and some other nice accompaniments like red wine shallot vinegar (my personal fav!).

The place was hopping and it is small so it gets really loud, really fast.
Our table also had:
- their house french fries (really good - comes with aioli mayo)
- fish tacos (looked great and comes with avocado)
- their special was a whitefish with crispy skin on lobster and corn chowder (this was tres fab!)
- good wine list -- lots of local options and reasonably priced -- all picked to go well with oysters

What to love about the place?
- the food - the food - the food

Downsides?
- when it gets busy it is so loud that at a table for 7 I could not even hear people at my own table speaking, even someone next to me if they were turned away from me talking
- servers are hopping so you will wait a bit to get their attention
- do they have air/con -- sure didn't feel like it last night -- ugghhhh was hot-hot-hot!

Otherwise -- I do like the place and we'll be back.  Just maybe not in the summer."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  Great portions.  I recommend sharing. I was stuffed.  Not great if you have a group.  It's small. My only gripe was the poor service.  Our server seemed over stressed. We had to hail him all the time for drinks...bill. It took forever for the food. 20 minutes between courses for just two people? We ordered fish and chips. The oysters were super fresh. I would go back for sure on a less busy night."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great fish and chip, chowder, French fries(with sauce), and amazing oysters!  Best in the city, the place my wife and I go to celebrate or treat ourselves."}
{"text":"4/5:

Oyster boy had a great vibe to it, like a modern fishermans pub. The restaurant owners were great, very friendly and they have some good recommendations as to which oysters to choose from.

I went in for a quick snack so I ordered half-dozen B.C. oysters (I cant remember the name) on ice and an order of the onion rings. The oysters were very large and fresh, a great recommendation. The onion rings were absolutely memorable. They were the largest onion rings I have had in my entire life. And some might ask, was it quantity or quality? It was both. Best onion rings I've had in my life.

I would definitely come again, I would love to try the Po' Boy.

Recommendations: trust your server and ask for a recommendation for the oysters, and definitely try the onion rings."}
{"text":"Servers are knowledgeable on oysters, which I'm especially thankful for because I'm not. Sampled quite a few, and fell in love with the Cascumpec Bay oysters from PEI. Also had the pasta, which was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst dining experience at Oyster Boy that I wanted to share particularly with women who don't want to be patronized, bullied, berated and degraded.

I was there this evening and sat at the bar with a friend. Bartender/ shucker was talking to an older couple of men beside us about whiskies. Unsolicited, pointing at my friend, he goes \"yeah, he's the type that like shitty whiskies like Maker's Mark.\" To which my friend shrugged and told him it's fine. Weird, rude but whatever- people have their \"off\" days.

Then, maybe two minutes into my meal, I told my server there was a long piece of blond hair in my food. At this point, I had only taken two bites. The hair was blond- I made sure of it because in the past when it happened, I would always be paranoid that it's my own so I wouldn't say anything. The shucker, again unsolicited, yells \"you sent the food back? oh man I'm always so embarrassed to send food back because it's probably my own!\" At this point I've been really annoyed with his comments. I told him \"The hair is blond. My hair is black.\" He scoffed and shook his head and laughed to himself. He implied I'm cheap and wanted to have another dish. My server sent back the dish and offered to bring another plate.

So I'm pretty shook at this point, people sitting at the bar are a bit baffled at this shucker and gave me a sympathetic, understanding look.

While we're waiting, my friend asked if he could sample a different beer from which he was drinking. The shucker immediately roared in laughter and wagged his finger saying \"I know your type man, I know your type! You just wanna sample all the fucking beer and get drunk without paying! I know you man!\"

At this point I'm fuming. I didn't ask to be berated and patronized at dinner. The food came and I asked my friend if we can leave. My friend was cool with it so I asked the food to be packed up- calmly, nicely. I made sure of that. Just \"may I please pack this up to go?\" To which he looked over, alarmingly agitated, slowly and rising in volume said \"what... the... FUCK\" to me. I told him that I'd just like to leave. He said \"is there a problem with the food THIS TIME AGAIN?\" with his head bobbing side to side patronizingly. 

I took a deep breath. How dare him! I was trying to go without making a scene. I told him the food has been excellent, so has been our server. I told him the problem I have is with him degrading, berating and patronizing us the whole time. None of it was solicited and I listed out the three things that I had a problem with.

He gave the classic \"oh my god calm down... what the fuck... I'm sorry YOU feel that way. That I RUINED your night.\" All while scoffing and glaring at me.

The server shooed him away while he's still heard cussing us out and throwing his hands up in the air. I took out my card to pay, visibly upset but quiet. The server told us we won't need to pay for this given his service but I insisted. She insisted back and he's heard going \"WHY! We already talked about it it's fine! CHARGE THEM!\" The server gave him a look and we left.

The server and food were great. But nothing positive from that experience will never make it OK for me to go through that humiliation again.

Needless to say my friends and I will never return to this establishment. 

Bullying is never okay."}
{"text":"Ate here on a whim walking by. My GF had a bunch of diet concerns and they were very accommodating right of the bat. Our female server was top notch. The oysters were of course the bomb but top to bottom everything we ordered was fresh as ever tasting. Lobster rolls, clams, scallops and shrimp were all very flavourful and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"WaS fine and dandy until the manager of my last visit was way too power tripping.  When it's slow she gave me all drinks no problem but when just she became controlling freak with my drinks!  She OK on staff shots and me having 7 glasses of wine when slow day but started controlling when I was offered drinks and started to act like she cared? If you want a parent to attend then this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"I went to Oyster Boy, and all I got was shitty service and mild food poisoning.
 The Service was pretty slow, pacing was staggered between appetizers and mains.
 The Mussels really did a number on me. Unfortunately, it only takes one to really mess you up, and I won that Lottery. In fairness - it could happen just about anywhere...if the shell is open just a couple of millimeters, and it's not caught by the prep/cook - you're in for a long drive on the big porcelain bus.
  A Day and 4 liters of Gatorade later, I'm convinced I won't go back. The Fish and Chips was great though...really filling, cooked perfectly. The Mollusk poisoning is why I'm giving it one star. It kind of over-shadowed the terrible service."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of fresh and yummy oysters. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. I had oysters and the Artic(sp?) Char with beets and quinoa. I ate every.last.bite. My toddler and husband loved their meals, as well. Definitely worth it if you love good seafood:)"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and have never been met without a smile. And bringing clients is a perfect pay to intro them to the Toronto restaurant scene 
Food: phenomenal 
Ambiance: So Canadian 
Ppl: always welcoming 
Cost: worth it"}
{"text":"Had dinner at oyster boy on a Saturday night. As others have said, make sure to call ahead for a reservation. Tried a few types of oysters - fresh, good selection, nice accompaniments. For the main, I had the mixed grill and they've definitely added more to it than I saw in past yelp photos and it is ALOT of food. 3-4 large shrimps, 3-4 nice size scallops, grilled calamari, mussels, crab leg, parmesan fries Plus a whole grilled sea bream. It was enough food for 2 (if you got 2 apps and that as a main - more than enough food for 2 people). My dining partner had the artic char, which was very nice too but he definitely had room to help me finish off the mixed grill platter. Service was very nice too. I'd def come back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an oyster joint in Toronto than this place is for you.
When I went, I was hardly an expert on oysters, so I relied on the knowledge of my server. I mentioned how we knew Malbec oysters were supposed to be good, but he suggested a different east coast oyster from New Bruinswick that they had just gotten in. He stated that in his opinion it tasted better AND it was cheaper. Sold! I really appreciate places that do not try to oversell the clientele. Our server totally hooked us up as they were quite good, and all of the three sauce accompaniments were great. We also got a plate of fries, and I would put them up at some of the best fries in the city. They are very thin and crispy, and come with your choice of mayo (curry, chipotle, etc). We also got some coleslaw which was loaded with dill and was a good pairing with the seafood fair that they offer."}
{"text":"Was in town for a concert at the Ricoh Coliseum. We found this great seafood place just a couple of minutes away. 

Tasty beers on tap. Had a lager and a nice hoppy ale. I enjoy hoppy beers, IPA's and such. 

I have never eaten Oysters before last night. One of my general rules when it comes to eating, the visual aesthetics is very important to me. Oysters do not look visually appetizing, at least to me. My dinner mate convinced me to try them. Normally having a few beers before hand normally will loosen up my inhibitions, not today, no time.  I believe it was one of the owners who brought over a sampler dozen. The plate presentation was nicely prepared with lemons separating the different types, with freshly shaved horseradish in the middle on a bed of ice. He took the time to inform us of each of the different species, and what was the approiate topping to apply.  i was amazed with the different flavor of each one. They slid down my gullet, no problem.  My dinner companion explained to me that i was lucky to experience a fine quality product for the first time. Apparently if they are gamey, your throat might lock up in rejection. I loved the fresh briny taste that lingered on my pallet. 

The main entree that i ordered the fish tacos. Once again, i was not disappointed.  The fish was prepared with a nice breading. The fish had a crispy outside with a nice moist and flaky inside. The sauce that was drizzled over the fish was amazing, had a zingy flavor to it.  My buddy had the lobster roll, it looked very tasty even though i didn't try it. That came with a generous portion of french fries. 

All in all, I really enjoyed every aspect of the Oyster Boy. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the Toronto area.  The next time I am in the Toronto area, I live about an hour away in Buffalo, NY, I look forward to eating here again. Great location also, plenty of local shops right in the area."}
{"text":"Dear Oyster Boy: I love you. 

I've frequented this place numerous times already and it surely does not disappoint. But the last time I went, it exceeded every expectation. A few friends and I had decided that we were going to grab a bite at our beloved Oyster Boy just before a wine tasting event. Typical Toronto traffic held us up, so I gave them a call to inform them that we were going to be late for our reservation. Since we had an earlier seating on a Tuesday night, I asked if we could place our orders over the phone so we wouldn't be late for our next event. This was no problem to them. Since we love this place so much and practically have the menu memorized, we ordered a dozen of the medium sizes PEI Malpeques oysters, sturgeon ceviche, and an order of fish tacos. When we arrived 15 min after our reservation time, we were greeted with our oysters on our reserved table. At this point, my love for this restaurant exploded even more. Our server (who also took our order on the phone) was amazing-- unfortunately I can't remember his name. In any event, the oysters here (I find) are the freshest in Toronto, the fish tacos (the best I've ever had) and their ceviche...sublime. This place is cozy, warm, inviting and simply charming."}
{"text":"This is a perfect setting for an intimate gathering. They've got a short, but comprehensive wine list and their selection of oysters is perfect. They usually have East and West coast oysters and their sauces (most are made in house) are a perfect compliment to their fare. The service is relatively prompt, the bathrooms are clean and the restaurant itself is typically chic for Queen street. I do wish the chairs were more comfortable since I'd like to stay longer. Their food can get a little pricey, so you might want to keep a running tab on your cell phone so you don't break the bank."}
{"text":"By far the best oyster place in Toronto and beyond.  They take pride in what they serve you.  I love oysters, but the other menu items are great.  Great atmosphere and super service.  I love going to this spot.  In fact you would have to travel far across the globe to find a better spot."}
{"text":"Best friend brought me here for my birthday, and I am totally in love with this place! 

They have high quality oysters, and also a variety of dishes that are made with meat, seafood, or vegetables. I really appreciate an oyster place that also serves non oyster, Seafood dishes. 

She made a reservation and our server greeted us nicely. She was super attentive and nice. We had a great time here due to the amazing quality of food, and the reasonable wait time for food. 

It's tucked in a corner ish place on Queen Street. Will definitely come back to try more of their stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  We stopped for a quick app and beer and there were no tables available.  The bartender/shucker/server offered to seat us right up front at the bar and we happily obliged.  

My fiancee and I ordered raw oysters (they had a dozen varieties that night) and baked oysters (5 types).  The raw came out with 3 special sauces and a freshly grated horseradish (I saw them grate it right before serving) and they were as fresh as you could ask for.  The baked unfortunately were forgotten by the server but he admitted that and served us 2 sets of 3 raws on the house because of the delay.  What service!  Every party that came in while we sat there (without reze) was asked to wait a sec and tables were checked to see if they could be fit in.  Again, great service by all 4 people that night.  Definitely a regular spot for us as we stop into TO monthly."}
{"text":"Looks like I've officially got a new favourite oyster spot in Toronto. Brought the parentals down from the 'burbs for a little celebratory dinner, and Oyster Boy delivered. Everyone was very happy with their meal. The oyster selection is remarkable, the crab cakes were fresh and meaty, and the steamed mussels were rich and sweet. Pops had nothing but good news about their pasta, and the fish and chips was the best I've had in a long time. Strangely enough, my favourite aspect of the meal was the veggie side orders. Caramelized Brussels sprouts with double smoked bacon and mushrooms in garlic butter? Make sure you order both. I was pleasantly surprised with the wine list, great beer selection and I think I saw some interesting single malts on the shelf behind the bar."}
{"text":"Went to nth a good friend there for dinner last night. He lives across the street from Oyster Boy. It did not disappoint. Nice size space for what it is. Just enough space for people to enjoy great food and drink, with the noise level at average, which was great. Sometimes these little places can get too loud. Our oyster girl took our order, we both had a full trout, which was perfect and delish! Good starters, entrees, wine and beer. Staff is attentive and fun. Highly recommend this place if you ha e a hankering for fish and fun"}
{"text":"I enjoy Oyster Boy for its casual atmosphere, fresh oysters and delicious specials. Service is friendly and obliging. It's always busy so reservations needed. Shellfish dishes are the strong menu items. Close to TTC. I generally go to Rodney's but OB is a good alternative and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Last night ( 6th August), we went to have some oysters and beers at Oyster boys. Oysters were really good but staff was very bad and rude..
I am from the industry and I know what customer service should be. And at oyster boys, didn't felt like they wanted us to be there. No smile on the face and all staff looked miserable. And staff eating at the bar when your customers are also sitting next to you??? Seriously??
We spend around $300 (4 of us).. we knew they close at 11 but normally when it's closing time means kitchen will be closing but not drinks and Friday night who closes at 11 and specially on queen st? 
The staff didn't have us last call and just came and smashed the bill on our table ( we haven't asked for the bill that time).. and when asked about it, the server as well as manager were very rude about it.
Just a suggestion for Oyster Boys, to keep the customer coming again, at least have a smile on your face and greet them, and be more friendly with customers. Don't make your customers feel like you don't need them in the restaurant which we felt and may be others did too. 

It was my First visit to Oyster boys and I think will be the last one.."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh seafood, oyster boy is definitely the place to do it!

Other than being know for the major (if not the only) supplier for oysters for restaurants in Toronto, they also serve fresh fish and other seafoods at their small yet charming restaurant.

Hands down my favourite is their mixed grilled seafood platter, which comes in a huge scallop shell metal plate and filled to the brim with scallops, king crab, shrimp, mussels, grilled fishing calamari and tasty fries. Yum!

They also do a half shot vodka and caviar special for $5, a steal if you ask me."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to satisfy our oyster craving and oyster boy fulfilled! & then some! We tried their suggestions of raw oysters - a dozen btwn the both of us and we loved em all! The baked oysters were also delicious, the crab cakes were good but not great, the Brussels sprouts - omg! we refrained from doing so but were tempted to ask for the recipe! They were divine! Great drinks and the service was wonderful too! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overall, this place was pretty good. The sauces for the oysters are nice, and the staff was friendly.

However, there were a few things. First of all, my friend specifically told the waitress that she was allergic to many fruits and vegetables and asked what was in the salad. After deciding she could eat it, she ordered it, and I got the crab cakes. Our food took a really long time to get to our table, and people that ordered and came in after us got their food first. When we finally got it, there were things in the salad (cucumbers and tomatoes) that hadn't been mentioned so my friend had to get hers remade. The crab cakes were okay, I ate all of it but started to feel sick by the end. They're heavy, but they were pretty good. 

We also ordered the buffalo fried calamari which was awesome. 

Later, it started to get really busy and it took me an hour to get three oysters. Then, I asked for the sauces and the waitress forgot about them so I had to ask again about 5-10 minutes later. 

The food was good but I don't recommend going if you're in a rush. Also, it's very pricey - which is understandable - but don't go if you're looking to eat somewhere cheap."}
{"text":"Favourite place for Oysters! Fresh amazing quality oysters. Amazing. That's all I can say. Every other oyster place has not levelled up to this place yet. It's great. Only thing is reservations! Keep in mind this place does get packed! I recommend the baked oysters!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars... the oysters were so good.  Come for those oysters!  Just choose the other dishes than what we picked and perhaps you'll have a great dinner.

For oysters, you only have a few spots that specialize it and I've heard how Oyster Boy is able to get a lot of fresh varieties around the world.  This spot next to Trinity Bellwoods is not very big ... maybe 12 tables at most with a few bar seating.  Definitely call for seating and don't expect to get a table for more than 4 people on the weekends.  It's a rustic space... kinda like a shack by the bay somewhere.  Lots of wood accents and tons of interesting nautical knick knacks.  It's clean but sparse.  

After being seated quickly, I have to say service here is attentive and polite.  We were constantly being checked on till we got our order straight.  I have to say their menu is pretty extensive with a lot of variety.  They also have a daily specials menu PLUS their oyster menu.  I have to admit that I was impressed to see 2 European oysters in addition to the West Coast and East Coast varieties.  They had at least 12 different oyster types for you to try.   

With both oysters, we were given 3 sauces to add to the oysters.  You have a red wine vinaigrette that has a strong sour taste to it.  A cocktail sauce that is sweet and mild.  Then you had a spicy one that had a good medium kick to it... the only problem with this one was that it could overwhelm the flavour of the oyster because it's so strong.

Cascumpec Bay oysters - I liked these ones.  They're meaty for their medium sized shells.  It's a clean flavour that was balanced... not too mineral or metallic or salty.  It's a great one to start off.  These were shucked beautifully.  No broken shells and the meat just sitting pretty.  4/5

Beach Angel oysters - These are a bit smaller than the Cascumpec but I found these to be a bolder flavour.  More briney with a touch of a light vegetable creamy finish. I kinda like these more more than the Cascumpec.  I'm a bit partial to West coast and these helped confirm that.  Like the Cascumpec, these were shucked very well... the oysters were just gorgeous in the shells.  No broken parts or shells.  4.5/5

Seafood chowder - A large bowl arrived to the table and it was very hot.   Though it had the traditional creamy texture and chunks of potatoes, I was kinda disappointed I didnt see any seafood in it.  Perhaps it was blended into it but there was no mussels, clams, fish, or shrimp... all I found was carrot and potato pieces.  It wasn't bad but certainly not a chowder worth $13.  2/5

Tuna tostada - A special we grabbed and it was a nice light dish.  Impressive looking as we got a fair bit of tuna on the crispy corn tortilla on the bottom.  It had a lot of creamy avocado with a bit of chillis thrown in.  I would have loved to have more of a flavour other than the occasional chilli.  Some lemon or something... it was quite mild in flavour with avocado being the prominent mild taste.  Still a generous portion ... maybe not the easiest to share though!  3.5/5

Buffalo fried calamari - These were not the sauced up versions I was expecting.  Fried crispy but the buffalo sauce was incorporated into the breading so it was just crispy and not as flavourful as I would have expected.  A touch more salt would have been helpful.  Also, the breading fell apart quite a bit and was a bit heavy ... in the sense that it absorbed a lot of oily.  Though served hot, it wasn't a bad starter.  Just one that I wouldn't grab again.  3.5/5

I think we ordered wrong here... we didnt have enough to go after the large seafood mix grill and I think the large dish of mussels would have been better.  We saw a few tables down order this and it looked really good.  I think it's safe to say stick with the oysters and mussels... things with a shell really and you'll be better off."}
{"text":"If you sit by the bar you get to hear some pretty interesting conversations between the charming, well informed staff and shy, \"I'm not sure I actually like oysters\" friend of someone that LOVES oysters and dragged shellfish newbie out to this charming restaurant. If you arrive early (before 7) it is easy to get a seat. After that reservations recommended. You can even walk in off the street and order a platter for take-away. But I'd call ahead during peak hours. 

Oysters. Lots of them. They have three house made sauces. But these oysters are so fresh they barely need a dash of lemon. 

I had 6 Black Point large and and 6 St. Simon choice. Just amazing. And if they have them available, get some Barnstable. You won't be disappointed.

Also good chowder."}
{"text":"A little hard to find... but well worth it once you do.

We got to sit at the bar, and just had raws.  Great suggestions for the shucker dude- was fun to watch him open, clean and present.  He checks each oyster for smell and freshness and isn't shy about ditching ones that don't pass snuff.

Fresh ground horseradish, plus a few sauces if you fancy.  Kitchen menu looked pretty good too.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Oyster Boy lives up to it's rep. Best Oyster bar in Toronto. I used to think Rodney's was the best but Oyster Boy is more intimate and the staff is super friendly. Superb oysters. Good selection and great advice and knowledge of oysters. Cooked food: perfect clam chowder, sweet succulent clams and deep fried oysters are fried light and fluffy with panko coating.

We were with a newborn and called ahead for a reservation letting them know we'd have a baby with us.  They gave us a booth and were very welcoming.  Service by all the wait staff and servers was attentive and friendly.  We were there for two hours and didn't feel rushed despite it being decently busy."}
{"text":"It's totally fucked that this place even exists. It's like Legal Seafood came from Massachusetts met someone with a subtle Scotian vibe, they got nasty  in Trinity Bellwoods park and their baby was so hot they had to birth it right beside the park at Oyster Boy. Oysters and accoutrement are sublime (obviously). Brussel sprout appy is next level delicious, chowder was OK (pretty potato heavy, gotta be profitable right?). Great place to be, happening."}
{"text":"Best sea food restaurant! 
Starters are delicious ( def. try spinach crab dip and crab cakes)
Lobster excellent !
Halibut with veggies and fried onion latest item on the menu I tried and I was not disappointed
As for oysters, great variety with different sizes. All tasty and fresh! But kusshi are my personal favourite with a dash of lemon.
Atmosphere is upbeat and service was prompt! 
They do get busy - would suggest making a reservation if you are going with a group."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were the best in North America . Service was slow. Had 24 oysters and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh oysters and the fish tacos were delicious- tons of flavour and not overwhelmingly greasy. Servers weren't that attentive and were slow on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"I have never been to Oyster Boy. 

But I have been eating dozen and dozen of oysters that were supplied by Oyster Boy in various locations: bars and events around the City.

The most recent encounter was an Yelp Elite Event where they were so kind of bring in a whole cooler of oysters and shucked those fresh for us.

I wish I can shuck like the shucker at Oyster Boy. He shucked the whole cooler of oysters with grace, checked and make sure every single one were fresh, while we all crowded around like hungry wolves looking at our prey.

The oysters were so good, fresh and has a buttery mouth feel.... 

Now I really want to go to Oyster Boy and have more of those amazing oysters!!"}
{"text":"If you are lucky enough to grab a table in this spot, celebrate!  Food is fresh and delicious and the vibe is buzzing.
Check what's delivered for oysters - the servers seem very well informed and happy to help."}
{"text":"Limited oyster selection (for a place that has the word \"oyster\" in its name) and sub-par service. We walked in around 10:45 on a Saturday night and were immediately informed by the bartender that (1) there was no space (despite seeing 2 open seats at the bar) and (2) the kitchen would be closing soon. When we informed her that we only wanted to share some oysters and have a beer, she offered to seat us in front of the door/next to the cash register. The oysters themselves were fine but the person taking our order was not very friendly (heads up: \"CK\" is apparently widely known to indicate small \"cocktail\" oysters). Overall a blah experience - one that I would not want to repeat any time soon."}
{"text":"Be careful when making reservations. Called them 2 days in a row, no answer. The voice machine said leave a voice mail with your details to reserve a table. So I did. Showed up for my time, the restaurant said they do not have a table for me"}
{"text":"Fresh, constantly-changing selection of oysters, knowledgeable, friendly staff, kick-ass fries, did I mention fresh oysters?

Came to Toronto on business, was in an oyster mood.  Found this place due to Yelp.  Pretty expensive for oysters IMO, ~$22-$30/dzn, but they were excellent.  They had 6 different varieties to choose from at the time, 4 east-coast and 2 west-coast.  The shucker(my apologies if he reads this, I forget his name right now) said the owner takes the staff on tour every year to try oysters in different locations, and only stock their place with the best.  

Here's the thing about this place that I loved.  Their sauces are some of the best I've ever had.  Seriously.  Oysters come with fresh-ground horseradish, house-made cocktail, house-made mignonette, and house-made pepper/hot sauce.  They're all incredible, but I've been trying to train myself on oysters w/a squeeze of lemon only.  Couldn't resist with these ones, though.

I also ordered fries, on account of the sauces.  They had a house-made curry sauce that was like curry crack, I'd steal the recipe if I could.  They also had two other sauces available, and I'm sure they were just as amazing.

Also, they have beers the size of your head for $6, and you can order take-out oysters for a hell of a lot cheaper.  

I am planning another trip to Toronto over memorial day, and you can bet your sweet a$$ that I'm coming back her to get more oysters & fries."}
{"text":"came here. got 100 oysters to share. diff types. all wonderful. the staff were SO nice. but of course, the oysters were the star. would def return. i prefer to Rodneys b/c the prices seem better, and the service is nicer"}
{"text":"I've got a weak spot for oysters and this is my go to place. There's a variety of oysters that come in fresh from different regions available to you. It's a simple joint that focuses on one thing and they do it well. The restaurant is small and fills up quick so make sure to nab a reservation."}
{"text":"My go to oyster place ! Been visiting this restaurant over the years. I only come here for oysters. Their oysters are always fresh. But i've also tried their desserts before. Their desserts are okay but nothing special. 

My average spending per night is about $200. That's how much I love oysters. Oysters are always a hit. The service is a hit or a miss. The owners not particularly friendly though. 

Nice place for oysters. There's parking conveniently located along the road sides in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is sooo amazing! The absolute best place to go for oysters! 

Wonderful atmosphere, the high top tables and fun music give this place a nice homey/beach front vibe. It was very comfortable and welcoming. 

Friendly servers, very attentive to all the customers. But the best was how knowledgeable they all were with the menu. Recommendations were spot on for both oysters and drinks. I didn't order anything else but the lobster and oysters, but the fish tacos looked delicious and several tables had empty mac n' cheese bowls. 

I had an incredible evening there and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oysters oysters oysters. Between the two of us we shared 2 dozen mix of Kumamoto's, PEI's, and honeysuckles. The textures and flavors were so complex and delicious. They obviously know their oyster-stuff.  For mains, we had the fish and chips (crispiest, yummiest I've had) and I had the mussels (which were small, which is why I took one star off)...but it was just probably seasonal

The place itself is small and quaint...actually perfectly sized. The shucker really knew what she was doing and smelled each one she shucked as to assure freshness. Servers were attentive even if it was a full house on a Tuesday night. Solid oyster place for sure. I'd be a regular if we'd live in T.O."}
{"text":"I'm mixed on Oyster Boy.  I came here once for dinner, and ended up having to wait for about an hour for a table.  Then wait staff were rude, the food was not too good, and the night ended up with me having food poisoning.  

Yet another time, I took the Shuck U class with Adam Coloqhun (sp?) and it was great, he is super knowledgeable on bivalves and a great teacher.  Oysters were amazing too, it really makes a difference when a restaurant knows how to handle its oysters!  

So all in all I'd say, come here for the oysters, but otherwise dinner could be hit or miss."}
{"text":"4.5 
I've been here 3 times so I may as well write a review. 
Pretty tasty and good oysters. I hear they supply other restaurants with the oysters...not sure. 
It all depends on what is your favorite and if they are in season. They shuck em right in front of you. I like the light malpeque and my bf the colville bay. Both are great. They are pretty knowledgeable about them as well, though, what do I know? Friendly staff, one in particular is pretty abrupt but I guess that is just his personality. 
Too bad they don't have buck a shuck nights because it can get pretty pricey. So when you order a bunch of large vs small make sure there arent any small that snuck on to the platter ha. 
Their food is pretty darned good too...
Helloo fish tacos! So delicious (reflected in the price though) 
And their extra gigantic crunchy onion rigs! 
All very yum. A good go to!"}
{"text":"A GREAT oyster feast. 24 raw and a platter of baked oysters. Yum!  Mains were also delicious. The dungeness crab and scallop pasta was nice. Dessert, a lemon tart, hit my standard for tartness. Friendly server was completely relaxed about letting us wait quite a long time before ordering while the last member of our party battled rush hour traffic. An enjoyable evening on all fronts!"}
{"text":"Just had a very nice experience here today. 

I'd been craving lobster and decided to come here based on the reviews. 

Unfortunately, they only had 2 pound lobsters, which were too big for me, especially since I was planning to have me some baked oysters. When I have a lobster all to myself, my sweet spot is 1.5-1.75 pounds. So I ended up having the grilled halibut instead. 

I came in about an hour or so after they opened and was greeted by (who I think was) the Oyster Boy himself. The service was kind and attentive without being too chatty. He gave me some good recommendations - he helped me choose the halibut over the pasta because I was already having half a dozen oysters. That was a good call because otherwise I would have been uncomfortably full!

Now, about those oysters! To be honest - and I may get my Asian card revoked because of this - I prefer my oysters cooked. So I ordered half a dozen, two each of the flavours available.

When they came they smelled diviiine - cheesy and baked and rich. They were also beautifully presented on a bed of salt, I think. They were super delicious though the oysters were slightly smaller than I expected. The Rockefeller were probably my favourite - tho spinach had soaked all the delicious juices, and the tiny bit of fennel really enhanced the dish, and made the flavour profile more complex. The Royale was good too - nice flakes of crab meat soaked in their delicious bechamel, which was gorgeous. I think it had white wine or something - it was savoury and seasoned perfectly. My last favourite was the Rustico, which was actually quite good too. The gruyere was delicious but there was a kick to it and I don't usually gravitate towards spicy seafood.

The halibut took a while but it was worth the wait! It was thick and flaky and smoky from the grill. I liked how they let the flavour speak for itself and didn't mess with too much herbs and stuff. The bed of hash it came on was one of the most delicious things I've had recently! Everything was uniformly diced, the thick sticks of bacon were crispy and juicy, and the spinach soaked all the flavours up. This was also flavoured perfectly - I wouldn't add or take anything away.

Can't wait to come back, with friends next time!"}
{"text":"The place doesn't have the proper name. It should be \"Fish'n chips boy\".
They seem to be doing this quite well.
As far as the oysters they were fresh (that's pretty much the minimum you can ask for) but it felt like they went ashore to open them considering the time it took to reach our table in between orders.
Now the worse part: a simple dish like oysters is enjoyable by the attention given to what surrounds and supports it. Here the bread was plain bad, the butter blah, and in the vinegar/shallots sauce the shallots were...symbolic.
I come from an oyster culture. My 85 year old grandma use to bycicle to the fish market once a week to get her dozen... so my judgement might be altered. Say if I was italian it felt pretty much to me as if a restaurant calling itself \"The Spaguetti guy\" took hours to bring you the pasta, and brought you scarce and bad grated cheddar at a luxury price!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come here. So when we saved up for our next dose of pricey seafood, we made sure this was the place!

Crispy friend onion rings $3.95, giant onion rings that are bigger than your palm. Love them! (and I usually don't like onion rings)

The oysters were so amazing, so fresh. No idea what we had... but we had fun! There were no more tables so we sat at the bar, where the waiter opened the oysters in front of us. It's a very small place, cottage-like. Cozy and loved that we came here on a winter night. 

Glad we came!"}
