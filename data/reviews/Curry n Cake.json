{"text":"Really good food. Try cheese dosa. I felt the cashier was pretty bored to stand behind the counter. She kept running inside every other minute. Next time I will just order out coz the food indeed is good."}
{"text":"We had the following: - Starter: Chilly Paneer - Entree: Kodi Vepudu and Chicken Shahi Korma - Desert: Pistachio cake and Passion fruit parfait - Other: Mango lassi, jeera rice, garlic naan  Pros - The lassis and chilly paneer were just superb! - The Kodi Vepudu was very flavourful. - Portions are large and are very well suited to be shared.  Cons - Western pallets will struggle with the level of heat used. - The deserts were good but could be better.  In Conclusion Curry 'n Cake presents a really interesting fusion of food which is far from being ordinary. We will definitely return but may need to ask about the level of heat in the future until our taste buds toughen up. Service was prompt and friendly and the dishes come with rice which was not clear from the menu."}
{"text":"It was very badly smelled, staff was very rude. I have ordered food for to-go and initially I was told to wait 25 minutes and then another 10 minutes. I have waited for 45 minutes, and guess what food is still not ready. I lost my appetite and  when asked to cancel the order, to my surprise he cancelled my order and didn't refund my money. The guy goes next time when you come in just tell my name and you will be served food. I lost $25. What a rip off!!!!"}
{"text":"Till date the food was great.. But today got the horror of tastes.. The food was extremely spicy.. (Coming from am Indian used to eat spicy food).. When I called.. All they were thinking was about the refund.. No customer courtesy no apathy... Was totally disappointed with the treatment."}
{"text":"I have tried the masala dosa and sambhar vada here and they have been really good ,specially the sambhar vada which was too good."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Especially Chicken 65, Biriyani, Dosa, Naan and Curry. They make crab masala and Chettinaad style curry which is awesome. Cakes are also very good. We order cakes very often. Service is also fast and good.   Very good restaurant for mixed type of food: typical south Indian, Indo-Chinese, Chat and other Indian food."}
{"text":"The quality of food has deteriorated so much recently that I have to write this review. Burnt naan , extremely spicy curry, paneer curries have less paneer. The price is very high for such food. The menu has very few items listed. Naan is around $3. There are better alternatives for Indian food around. I am not going to return to this place."}
{"text":"Food is really good.  No doubt about it.. they should still give priority to cleanliness ..."}
{"text":"it's okay, i mean it's probably the dirtiest place ever, but it's good to go once in a while. the food is always warm."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive.  The food is very, very good.  I am a vegetarian and eat at Indian establishment often.  The clientele was entirely Indian with the exception of my party.  I mention this because I prefer going to various ethnic restaurants that people of that ethnicity go to because in my experience, the food at those places are usually very good and authentic.  I ordered a curry and the Samosa Chat, both of which were delicious.  Their Samosa Chat is covered with a gravy/sauce which is the fist time I have every had it this way.  It was great.  My companion order a chicken curry which she enjoyed.  The food was prepared fairly quickly.  The food itself would be rated at 4 stars.  We did not try any dessert so I cannot comment or rate any of the desserts.  Now the bad.  The restaurant is very, very small.  It is more of a take out place in that there is not much seating.  There is no host.  There are no wait staff.  You go to the counter and order.  You have to fend for yourself to find seating.  We ordered the food for eat in and when the food was cooked, there was no place for us to eat.  So changed the order to go.  But then the a table left and we were able to eat in.   Then we forgot we did not order anything to drink.  They have a station for water and we had that.  So If you enjoy good Indian food, eat there but if it is in prime eating times get it to go. If a seat  opens as you wait grab it quick or you will be out of luck.  That is why the rating went down from 4 stars to three.  4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service therefore it averages out to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered indo Chinese , tasted good .. But less quantity.. Reduced one star for cleanliness.. But will come back again."}
{"text":"Worst bhel puri I had yesterday here. Full of groundnut and roasted channa dhal. Could not find any taste rather than the nut"}
{"text":"Are you missing indian pastries? Then visit this place you can satisfy your tastebuds. We often keep visiting this place and like paneer dosa, chicken fried rice. You can get pre ordered cakes; eggless cakes are also worth enough."}
{"text":"The place isn't very welcoming but I came in here because I heard their little cakes were good. I order one of each of their flavor and honestly it's nothing special. It's actually kind of boring and they all kind of taste the same but it's just different color frosting."}
{"text":"Updated review as of 7/26/17: The sanitation and health score is in the mid-80s - unacceptable. The restaurant smells so strongly of perfume that I can't even stand in there and wait for my food. The lady taking orders over the phone is disinterested at best and rude at worst. And to top it all off, my food has been consistently bad the last three times I've ordered. The flavor is still good, but the execution is so bad. Gobi Manchurian should be crispy with a sauce. Not soggy like it's been sitting for hours. I've given multiple chances for redemption and I keep getting disappointed. I'm done."}
{"text":"You're killin' me, Curry n Cake.   I'll start with the positive: The food here is really, really, really good. The Chicken 65 is a fantastic mix of spicy and crunchy  with just enough sauce to make it moist, but you can still (and you'll want to) eat it with your fingers. There's a nice mix of \"old standards\" of Indian cuisine - Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, Goat Roganjos, Malai Kofta - and dishes I've never seen before - Chicken (or Gobi) 65, Hakka noodles, and Bhel Puri. Be warned, the spice level tends to be medium-high. That said, the food is delicious and fresh; the flavors are well-balanced; the breads are nicely cooked. I have not been disappointed with their savory food. I've only had a couple of their pastries, but those were great, too. On food alone, I'd give this place five stars without hesitation.  Now for the not-so-great: Even after being open for several months, they don't quite seem to have caught their stride. If it's busy and I'm ordering takeout, I have to call three or four times (and sometimes more!) before someone picks up the phone. They generally say \"20 minutes\" for the food; it's sometimes taken 40 or more. On one day, they ran out of rice. How do you run out of rice? (They did have biryani, which they gave away instead of plain rice, but it was really simply too hot for me - I like to use the rice to cut the heat of the curry a little) There is frequently an air of \"WE'RE GOING AS FAST AS WE CAN!\" in this place, especially during the lunch rush. It has the feel of a place that could use a lot of help with efficiency.  Here's the thing, though: These are growing pains, and they're minor headaches. In any case, the food is ABSOLUTELY worth it. I'd recommend going there in person if you can - you won't have to worry about waiting for a phone order, and they have counter service there, with about eight tables."}
{"text":"We ordered Mirchi bajji they gave Jalape√±o bajji - Worst sambar Vada that We ever had"}
{"text":"I bought the cake in curry and cake and asked them to write on the cake they used some paper to write it and the person who wrote is whipped the remaining on her dress and no glouse used while writing when I asked the guy who charged me is not responding he is not even sharing number to call. He is saying do what ever you want. And attending others with out even responding I was standing for a long time and gave a number saying owner who also didn't respond call and more over the guy who take the cake out of the freezer scratched nose 10 times and he didn't even wash hands or no gloves before taking it out and made me wait 10 mins before event talking to me"}
{"text":"Good place for street food in charlotte, though taste varies often. I personally like Gobi manchurian and indian pastries here."}
{"text":"Good pastries, awesome gobi machurian noodles, Hakka noodles, chicken 65..small space but good."}
{"text":"I  got the paneer panini here - it was very cheap and very delicious. The lady brought out our food promptly, but nothing else particularly special about the service."}
{"text":"I went here today after seeing that the management and name had changed.  It took a while for someone to come greet me, but I was ok with that because I wanted some time to look around to see what had changed. The no longer had those awesome Samosas out for sell like the last time I went but I still had hope for the rest of the menu.   Every dessert item had an extensive list of all the ingredients used to make each one. I choose the fig and honey chocolate cup and the Mango Cheesecake. The Fig and Honey was great but, nothing outstanding. I wish I could have tasted more of the fresh fig flavor as it is one of my favorite fruits. I even keep fig jam in my frig at all times. The Mango Cheesecake was AMAZING it tasted like I bit into mango by way of Cheesecake Factory. It had a large piece of chocolate on it for the garnish which was a little flimsy from being in a humidified case before it was package for me.   The only reason I'm giving this place a three is because of my overall experience which was really kind of MEH. Next time I would like to try some of the food options when I'm feeling a bit more adventurous. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I bought 2 boxes of biryani's, but it wasn't fresh. Seemed like it was cooked 2 days back. Rice was stale n didn't seem fresh, lacked taste. Expected better. Will avoid this place in future."}
{"text":"I would rather eat fast food before enduring through this experience again. I ordered a masala dosa and what came was a soggy crust with watery masala and a poor attempt with serving store bought chatni. As soon as you enter the place on the left is a pile of trash with happy flies scavenging while the area smells like spices. Between all of that they are trying to sell pastries so even though the cake was edible the environment takes all the joy out for me. Only redeeming factor may be perhaps that they do not overcharge on most items on menu.  I doubt even kitchen nightmares would be able to help. No thanks, moving right along."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food but 2 stars for the management/service. My experience on a given Friday evening was terrible. 7.30 pm and they would not pick up the phone for me to place an order for a pick up. I live 20 mins away. I arrived there and found a line of 8 people ahead of me. The phone was ringing off the hook and they did not pick it up the entire time I was there. It took 45 minutes to get to the counter and another 45 mins to get the food. It's a very small place so I was standing throughout. The ventilation is poor. I like to eat curry, not smell like curry. Their food is quite good but not worth the time and the trouble I went through to pick it up. The management seems nice but a \"sorry sir, this is how it is on Friday evenings\" does not win you a repeat customer. It is frequented by a lot of Indians and they have expanded their menu. The food is fresh, tasty, spicy and reasonably priced. The pastries are delicious. They are obviously doing well but cannot handle the traffic. Bottom line - pick up works best and avoid peak hours."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place plenty of times and I finally got a chance to try them out. I got the chicken tikka masala and a mango laser and it cost $15. Then when the meal arrives I find out the Naan is 2.71 extra.. I would have been better off ordering 1/1 chicken for the same price as I only got 4 small morsels. I'm very disappointed in the price for value. The food is good but they think way too much of themselves."}
{"text":"I'm suprised to see a low rating for this place. Atleast my experience was far better.   I've was at this place for NYE to get a cake. They have a small dine in place, cozy enough to have pastries or coffee but def not for dining.  The only cake that was avaliable was black forest and it was so perfect. The cake was fresh, not to sweet and reminded me of the pastries in india. The service was quick. Also tried their pound cake which was very good. I was suprised at the food here.   Didnt get a chance to eat anything but they do have limited menu with few indian items like dosa, vada, biryani and few other chat items.  I would recommend this place for pastries. Cannot comment on other food, as i didnt try it."}
{"text":"The place is dirty. They don't keep it clean. When I went the tables were really filthy. Their sanitation score is low too. The food isn't good either. The only thing I liked was their cake. I wouldn't go there next time for the food."}
{"text":"I  like the food here but customer service is horrible and they rip you off. For example I ordered chicken kutthu paratha , veg biryani, and chicken 65 all this to go. When I get there I was told they were out of chicken 65 OK that's fine . The girl adjusts my bill by taking chicken 65 off the ticket but keeps the tax on for that dish. Then got home open my food the curry with the kuthu paratha is half literally half a cup with 1 piece of chicken. They charge you $3 extra with chicken.I tried to call them 5 times to complain but the phone is going straight to VM. I'm very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Chole Batura and Jalapeno/Mirchi Bajji always taste good here! But expected more from the Black Forest Cake. Looks like they are renovating which is long over due!"}
{"text":"Love this place....don't miss the gobi manchurian and any type of hakka noodles....tastes heavenly!!!...been to this place twice in a week already"}
{"text":"Please don't ever order cakes at this location as the weight and theme of the cake we ordered and the final product they gave is totally out of sync because the chef said the full sheet serves 70-80 people which is 8kgs in weight but when we went to pick it up on the day of the event was very different in size like almost 4kgs and the design was different of what they showed us and as we didn't had any other option we had that and half of the guests left the event without having it.  Don't recommend having a cake for events here."}
{"text":"Chicken sukka was really good! Definitely coming back for that again! Biryani could have been a little better but it was still better than most so called Indian places out there!"}
{"text":"I usually eat here before shopping at the Trader Joe's nearby. The lunch special is an excellent value. For under $10, you get a curry, an appetizer, rice, sambar, dal, bread, and dessert, and on my latest visit there was also curd rice and a drink. In general the food is very good, though it's sometimes either too bland or too hot (temperature-wise) for me, and I've had a couple unsatisfactory meals here. The only other thing I've had is the rava dosa, which is also excellent. I have not tried the cakes."}
{"text":"This place has changed so much since early 2015. This used to be a favorite Indian take out for hubby and me esp for their naans, biriyanis, chaats, kothu roti and gobi manchurian. Unfortunately, the food did not taste half as good and the potion size has reduced considerably during our last 4 visits. I think the prices have gone up too. When I called to let them know about the food quality and potion size, I was simply told that the chef has changed. Their cakes are quite decent though. But then we are never going back to this place esp when you have so many other good Indian food choices around the same area."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place for cakes and pastries. I love their butterscotch pastry. It just melts in your mouth. They also provide amazing mirchi bajji, Hakka noodles and my favorite - the szechuan fried rice. This is a one stop for snacks, main course and deserts. Love these guys!!!"}
{"text":"[I wrote this review under \"Cakes n Flakes\" -- I dunno why yelp couldn't just change the name of the establish., instead of creating a whole new, empty entry]  After a brief closing for renovation, and a change in management, the caf√© formerly known as \"Cakes N Flakes\"  has now re-opened as \"Curry n Cake\".  There's still a refrigerated case; the samosas are gone, but cakes are still there (a few whole ones, and about 10 flavors by the slice: black forest, pineapple, pistachio, mango, etc).    The clientele looked the same as before, Indians in their +/- 30s (I was the only anglo in the place).  The door still says panini and wraps, but the menu doesn't have those, sticking with Indian foods like dosa, uttapam, and curries.  Today (a Saturday), veg. and non-veg. lunch specials were posted on the counter; I had the veg. for $6.99, which came with bowls of lentils and eggplant, rice, thin bread (rota), and crispy fritters -- very yummy.  I got a piece of butterscotch cake to go (I'm eating it right now; also yummy)."}
