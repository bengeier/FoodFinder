{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE sushi place. We have been going here for 6 years. They are so friendly, make amazing sushi and they don't put gross mayo in the sushi like some places. They deliver and the chef comes in his chef outfit and is the cutest! Good prices, great quality and delicious fresh sushi!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, one of the best sushi restaurants in Toronto. I am usually very picky about sushi. Everyone can make sushi, but not everyone can make good sushi. Prices were good and love the decor inside, which brings out a hint of Japan when dinning in. Great service, very attentive servers.

Their black dragon roll (unagi and avacado on a dynamite roll) and legend dragon roll (unagi, shrimp, avacado and tempura lobster) were AMAZING! Unlike other inferior sushi restaurant that compensate their lack of quality with quantity, Roncy's special Roll is just about the right size. And did I mentioned the chef's attention to details of presentation?  All the rolls were well presented with colorful vegetables (thinly sliced beets and carrots), meticulously arranged. Very appealing.

Highly recommended it, and will definately go back again"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible food and service. I had the sushi pizza, dynamite roll, salmon and toro sushimi. Honestly it was some of the worst I have ever had, the pizza was covered in mayo and the sushimi was frozen. Don't come here."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in the city and certainly best in the neighbourhood. Staff is friendly, remembers your face, if not your name. Great for takeout and delivery too."}
{"text":"Finally i'm writing the review of Sushi on Roncy :-)
My favorite roll and sushi store in Toronto!
I usually take out rolls for myself and friends or dine in with my family, and we love all the foods here! My family is big fan of Sushi & Sashimi and they said the Sushi & Sashimi here is really fresh and flavourful. My preference of the food here is ROLLS!!! The rolls here, is amazing.... I mean.. Really! Thin rice layer lots of ingredients. You've got to try the rolls here. Pretty patio, pretty plating! 
Also lots of veggie choices."}
{"text":"I hate to hate on something like a sushi bar in my new hood, but it has to be said: please, please don't drown spicy maki in gross chipotle mayo.

Now that the above statement is out of the way, this place seems otherwise alright. Fish was fresh, service was great and it even had decent atmosphere. Also, their lunch specials are pretty huge for the price... $10 for three 6-piece rolls is awesome.

I'll have to try the sashimi next time. Stay away from anything 'spicy'."}
{"text":"Thought the restaurant is visually 'Japanese' on the outside with the floating bubble machine and all. But once entering the place, things went from good to bad. We were seated right away which was a good sign, but quickly found out that they were tragically short handed on staff. The customers were waiting to order or to even get their menus. There is only one waiter for the whole place. Two Sushi chefs who were slow in food preparation, and the hostess/female owner was not pitching in to help with the inexperienced waiter at all. We had to ask for everything twice in order to get the requests.
The Sashimi dinner was good, the salmon skin hand roll was passable, but the special cut rolls are the same roll with the same sauce with different 'inserts'. ie. Fake crab meat and little to no soft shell crab in the Spyder Roll.
The experience did not improve after our dinner as we saw the patrons from the next table had to go up with their bill to pay at the counter? 
They need to be more efficient in running the restaurant and get more help. Need improvement with the quality of food for the money."}
{"text":"2 stars because our sashimi came still frozen, including the tuna  which was partially grilled. The Black Dragon description said it would have unagi and avocado but it also came with tempura shrimp inside - my partner eats Gluten-free so we were a little disappointed.

3 stars because the service was excellent (immediate choice of water or tea, complimentary noodle soup and salad, timely drink refills). The menu did have LOTS of choices and it took a while to decide - the waitress gave us plenty of time to think about it."}
{"text":"My go-to for sushi. The quality is spectacular - really nice, thick cut sashimi and perfectly composed rolls. Their salmon and butterfish are definitely stars. It doesn't seem like they carry a huge variety of less common types of fish, but it's great for the basics. Huge variety of maki rolls. The prices are very fair and the lunch specials are fantastic. Spacious interior and an awesome back patio. And super friendly service! Still the best place in Toronto for everyday sushi for me."}
{"text":"Average place. We've been here once. Great miso soup. Sashimi was ok - lacked flavour and texture. The lightly seared white tuna was exception. They did provide complimentary rice with the sashimi dinner. Complimentary dessert was two slices of oranges."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place when it first opened and it was so so, but I decided to give another try few years later, dine in. 

There were about 5 tables in the restaurant and the service was so slow. it took about 10 minutes before the server took our drink and another 10 before she brought it.  Ask for a refill and never got it. 

Service really needs to improve. Would I try it again? probably not with so many better sushi restaurant in the area, this one is a miss."}
{"text":"I go here fairly often, and while I'm absolutely wild about the place, it does the trick when I want some decent sushi. Staff are friendly, service is fast enough, and the cuts are good. Yesterday I ordered the black dragon maki, salmon & avocado maki, and salmon sushi a la carte. All were delicious, and the salmon on the a la carte sushi was excellent in both flavour and texture. The place is Korean-owned, which in my experience, more often than not, means great sushi, interesting additional menu items, and very friendly service. The after-dinner candies are also really good!

I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"We used to like Sushi on Roncy but now that is under new management we REALLY like it! The new owners are lovely and very appreciative of return customers! The food is even better and they now have some Korean options too, which is kind of nice since there are no Korean restaurants anywhere near here. Solidly good sushi. Love the chirashi! I'm giving in 3 stars but I would give it 4 for service!"}
{"text":"Staff are friendly but they had run out of Tuna belly and everything else was not tasty at all. enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef were crumbed and deep fried and tasted disgusting. Have had the same dish executed much better elsewhere. I know it is a chain but I much prefer Sushi Time on Queen West. I like to eat locally but doubt I will return here."}
{"text":"I love the sushi here and stop by all the time. Usually for takeout. The staff there is incredibly friendly and \"The Chef's Special\" is delicious. So glad it's in my hood and hope it's there for a long time."}
{"text":"If I could leave no stars I would. NEVER order from them on uber eats. EVERY single order gets cancelled 25mn after they say there's making the food. The problem is not uber eats it's them. I spent 40mn on the phone with uber trying to figure it out and this restaurant is THE RUDEST. SHITTY SERVICE."}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon covered in mayo?!!?  not very appetizing.
If you live in the neigborhood sure drop by, for below average sushi.  If you actually make the trek to the Roncys from somewhere else, look for other options."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a sushi restaurant in my life!

I tried to book a reservation on a Sunday evening. Called 6 times and a man very rude answered the phone on the 6th call. I asked him why the restaurant leaves a phone number but doesn't answer their phone, he said he's busy making sushi and cannot answer the phone. Crazy !

0 star for service 
1 star for food

I would not recommend this place to anyone. They don't even have employees inside. It's run by an old couple and they're extremely rude. The service was awful and slow. The sushi made me sick. The interior is poorly renovated and tiny like a rat cage.

Definitely won't be coming back anymore !!"}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi with odd flavour combinations that are made by seemingly amateur sushi chefs. No thanks!"}
{"text":"Loved the patio! The food was good too.
It was great for a romantic dinner  not too crowded with love songs playing in the background."}
{"text":"Hi well, we just dropped our usual 50 $  on sushi, but I have never tasted anything like this before, it's fast food taken to the ugly side of the street. this place covers everything in really salty sauce from who knows where . The beautiful subtle taste of good sushi is something the chefs at this restaurant have never tried, It takes an hour to drive 3 blocks and then delivers food no one in my family would eat. If you really like good sushi,  let alone great sushi avoid this place. The ship was dry the rise was stale and the seasoning sad, even the wasabi wasn't hot, very :("}
{"text":"Really nice place.  Good service, good food.  I used to love going here for quick good food when I lived on Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"The reviews are great of this place, but it's really not that bad. I wouldn't say it's the most amazing sushi, but also might have been because of what we got. It's definitely fresh, and this is sheeny was really delicious. We also got the spicy sushi platter, which all was pretty legit spicy.  Something about spicy sushi rolls being actually really hot isn't totally cool with me. It's not like an Indian restaurant where you ask for spicy and they serve up what you deserved sucka. It's sushi...  But other than that, probably some bad picks, the food was good and the staff were really sweet."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience from this place. I ordered sushi from them and it was totally delayed by an hour.  Our order never arrived. The driver was there but the food was never ready. Bad service. I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"The sushi isn't bad from Sushi on Roncy! The rolls didn't hold together super well and there was something lacking. It was still pretty yummy. But compared to my favourite sushi place on Roncesvalles, this was a miss. I'll stick to Sushi Nomi, at the corner of Marion and Roncesvalles!!"}
{"text":"I walked here with some friends since we didn't have a car. I begged them to go here because the pictures looked so nice from previous reviews. Two kilometres later, we made it. We walked inside and were kindly greeted. As soon as we were seated, my hopes of having an awesome dining experience were crushed. 

The server buzzers I saw in one of the photos looked so cool, and was one of the main reasons I wanted to go to this location. When we sat down, however, they were not on the table, but I just guessed since it wasn't very busy they wouldn't need them. I am a huge fan of sashimi, but after looking at the price and making sure with the waitress that the prices are correct on the menu, I was a bit shocked that 3 slices of salmon would be $5. Hesitant, I decided to buy it anyways since sashimi is a must-have whenever I go out for sushi. When it came, the slices were super thick, so then I understood the high price. The waitress was kind and was dressed in a lovely silk kimono top. When looking around, the tables were clean, but everything looked stained and dirty (walls, ceiling, decor, etc.) The ceiling vent was altered so it would blow air in a certain direction, but the thing was that they cut a sushi platter lid in half and duck taped it to the air vent. Innovative, but not an eye pleasing sight for a restaurant. 

There was a little corner for colouring books, Barbies, and other toys for kids to play with. I thought it was so cute, until I realized that it was placed right next to the entrance of the top of a stairway. Not the best placement for a kid's corner. 

When the food arrived, it looked appetizing. The sashimi was worth the price, but the California roll wasn't very crunchy, it was mushy, but my friend noted that it could have been because we were eating at 9pm, and the ingredients could have been old since it was the end of the day. 

I probably won't come back to this place due to price, freshness of ingredients and cleanliness of the place. The staff is very kind though, always serving with a smile."}
{"text":"Staff super friendly, fish a bit dodgy....eaten  twice here ( as we love the patio) and both times felt sick after . Sashimi should not taste fishy...and a little hard on outside . Bathrooms filthy ."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Miso soup, pure salt. Veggie Deluxe roll was supposed to be Avocado, Cucumber and Yam (in that order) and it came with 90%yam. The Bi Bim Bap had an awful sauce added to it. When we asked about the veggie roll, they said it was how it came and even though we returned it, it still appeared on our bill and charged us for it. What a disappointment, Roncey needs a good Sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Decent food (although a limited menu)
VERY bad service. They usually don't have anybody in the restaurant that speaks English well so ordering over the phone is usually painful. Regularly quite late with food. Also they seem to not deliver on random days. Inconsistent service."}
{"text":"So fresh we ordered sashimi the cuts were thick and beyond our expectations. We ordered for our company dinner party from Sushi on Roncy ,

We actually forgot to put our order in and ended up ordering late we asked the lady on the phone if she could rush our order and she said no problem,  our order arrived early at the office and all of us were super pleased at the quality and amount of food that was delivered:)

The driver who delivered our food was super gracious and friendly. But better than the service was the food everyone in the office who worked there enjoyed the sushi from sushi on Roncy and that's an amazing feat as we have some picky eaters and sushi buffs ,

Thank you once  again for accommodating our management offices dinner party and going above and beyond for us. sushi on Roncy you rock!!!"}
{"text":"A good sushi place on Roncies is very welcome and Sushi On Roncy doesn't disappoint.

The variety and presentation of the food is excellent. The crunch rolls in particular are unbelievable, so much so that I may just begin replacing side dishes with a second serving.

There are some design issues and morgue like lighting hurt the atmosphere but in general its a neat and tidy place run by a very friendly staff.


Sushi On Roncy has been designated our official pickup for sushi."}
{"text":"For just over $20, I got a mixed tempura (about five pieces), 8 pieces of sushi and 6 mini assorted roll pieces.  That's kind of a rip off.

 At Sushi on Bloor, for just over $14, I can get a salad, soup, huge bento box - with the option of salmon, chicken or beef, a big california roll and a large roll of my choice. 

Sushi on Roncy needs to offer better deals, Toronto has tons of sushi places to choose from, why would I pay so much for so little?  Their staff is friendly and the sushi is okay but I'd rather go out of my way to pick up from Sushi on Bloor.  Including subway fair both ways, it still costs less."}
{"text":"AWESOME! I love their Chef Special rolls. This place has huge sushi rolls and fast delivery, what more can you ask for. They are also kid friendly, really nice, and have good service. Definitely my favorite sushi place in all of Toronto, with Mazz Sushi on Bloor as a close second."}
{"text":"My friend had to drag me to this place because I was reluctant to eat sushi on Roncy. Let's be real: If a restaurant in Roncesvalles in not selling pierogies and red beat soup, my general assumption is that the food is a flop. Roncy is where Polish cuisine comes to shine, so I thought, \"Why would I come here to eat mediocre sushi, if North York's delicious sushi buffets are only a short TTC trip away?\" 

Well, once again my uneducated assumptions were proven wrong. The second I put that creamy piece of salmon sashimi in my mouth, my judgments were silenced. I'm by no means a sushi connoisseur, but I've been around. Sushi on Roncy is my favourite sushi joint in the city.

Most importantly, the sushi is divine. It's fresher than a newborn. The sashimi's texture is smooth and practically melts in your mouth. Yesterday I ordered the Philadelphia Roll, which features cream cheese, avocado and smoked salmon, the three greatest ingredients of life. I also had a small order of smoked salmon and a raw seaweed salad. Since I already praised the sashimi, let's talk about the seaweed salad. The portion was pretty big compared to other sushi restaurants. It was also delicious. In some places, the seaweed salad tastes soggy, but this one was amazing and gone in a split second. I literally swallowed it like a human hoover. My friend got the chicken teriyaki, which I thought was a lame choice. But when I put that chicken breast in my mouth, I fell in love. This is the only place where I would ever consider ordering chicken teriyaki. They actually put a large portion of perfectly cooked chicken on your plate. 

Prices are decent. They're not cheap, but they're fair. My bill came to $21 and I had a fresh seaweed salad, salmon sashimi and a Philadelphia roll. Since Toronto is busting with all-you-can-eat sushi buffets, a lot of people might think that 21 bucks is a lot, but my meal was filling. Plus, I prefer ordering fewer dishes and enjoying my food, rather than stuffing my face with whatever comes at me to get my money's worth.

The quality of the service matches the quality of the food. It is fantastic. Even the chefs smile at you, as you walk in. My server was a sweet girl, whose kindness was sincere, rather than fake or pushy.  

Overall, this place is amazing and will be my go-to place whenever I'm craving sushi.

Ps. They also do delivery!"}
{"text":"Went here randomly for dinner the other day. The atmosphere ni the restaurant is very cute and quaint. It is very Japanese style. We were instantly greeted by very friendly people, and they got us a seat very quickly.

There are so many different special sushi rolls here that it was overwhelming but amazing. It took a long time for us to figure out which one we wanted. We ended up getting the caterpillar and lion king. When the rolls came, we couldn't wait anymore. The rolls were presented so well, and best of all, the rolls actually tasted really great. The rice was so soft and the fish tasted so fresh. 

Overall, I would definitely go back to have sushi if I'm ever in the neighbourhood. The price for the rolls weren't ridiculously overpriced, which made it even better."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, standard stuff. i got tempura udon broth which had a nice flavor and the tempura was very well done. the menu is large and it is quite a nice resto for a date or a family. the service was good as well, she came by and refilled by water and asked how things were a couple of times. the washrooms were clean.  i took off 1 point b/c it's slighty more expensive than i'm used too (maybe by $2-4 more) and it's nothing extraordinary. traditional sushi, exactly what you would expect in a sushi resto so no complaints there.  i haven't tired the sashimi there so i can't comment on the fish."}
{"text":"For dinner, friends invited us to meet them at a sushi place on Roncevalles called Sushi on Roncy. The place is a small Japanese restaurant with a larger patio off the back of the restaurant. There were a few local families who were comfortable in the place so we had a choice of tables. There is a sushi bar at the front of the restaurant and a few indoor tables separated from each other by Japanese screens. We opted for a table inside because the humidity and heat of the day had still to cool off. The menu features items expected in any Toronto sushi restaurant and it was nice not to see mayonnaise as a featured item. There was also an Ikayaza menu that was intriguing featuring grilled fish and vegetables. I decided to try the nasudengaku, some grilled tuna and the grilled eel. Everyone else opted for sushi rolls and everything arrived in a pleasant and well thought out manner. The food was good for the price paid and the service was quick and attentive making it an enjoyable place popular with local families."}
{"text":"A decent sushi place in an increasingly diverse neighbourhood. Very very family friendly (there are toys available) and fairly priced. The food is quite good- comparable to most mid-range sushi restaurants-and the wait time was reasonable. Will definitely check them out again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of this place, but I need to update my review for two very important reasons. Brown rice and pickled radish rolls. 

I am trying to eat healthier where possible (going on six whole days now;), and I was pleasantly surprised that this place has a whole grain/brown/purple rice option for their rolls. It didn't quite hold together as well as the white rice rolls do, but it was beautiful to look at and made me feel good about myself. 

Lastly, neither my husband nor I had ever heard of a pickled radish roll before. We had not lived. Get it, get it."}
