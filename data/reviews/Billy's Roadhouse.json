{"text":"Best weekend breakfast in the North Hills.  It does not hurt that Billy's starts pouring drinks at 9am on the weekend.  Since I started going to Billy's breakfast, I have brought several friends all of whom have loved it."}
{"text":"Great little hidden spot.  Large menu,  above average bar food. Terrific burgers!  Could use a few more craft beers.  Go early to avoid the crowds and loud drunks."}
{"text":"Fair. Nothing outstanding. The service was prompt and friendly, but the food was just average. We had pierogies as an appetizer which were fairly tasty for potatoes and cheese. Then my husband and I split a Rueben sandwich that contained some gristley meat. Our son had a pretzel that was fair, along with a \"just fair\" cheeseburger and fries. Overall impression: Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is the best bar in the North Hills.  Cozy and not too loud. Douchers generally don't come here, thankfully.

Their wings are great. Tons of flavors. Just stay away from the bourbon wings.  Spotting a buck is tantamount to winning the drunk lottery. $1 beers all night if you're the first to call it.

Negatives, beer selection kind of small and yokels will occasionally put country music on the jukebox.

My advise, don't go here. I say that selfishly because I'd hate for it to become another loud and crowded bar filled with douche bags and rednecks.

But if you do come here, Chelsea and Jess are the best. Tip them well."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was terrible. Bar tender stood in the corner the whole time talking to her friend..."}
{"text":"From the start I had doubts. The place looks like a mediocre bar. The menu had TONS of food. I got wings and buffalo fries. The wings were the best wings I've ever had, and the fries were amazing also. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible!  I've been going there for 20 yrs and it has fallen off a ledge. Waited 45 min for wings and a sandwich, once I finally got it ...the wings had human hairs wrapped around them, sandwich bread was soggy and they didn't remember anything I asked for. Service didn't apologize or anything. Stay away!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time because we were looking for something new where we could watch a game or sit and b.s. with friends and we found a pretty damn good spot. 

Burgers were good, wings were good and beer was cheap. Got the half order or bacon cheese fries to start, hoping they would be fresh cut but I'm guessing they're from the bag. Not bad but probably won't get them again. 

All and all though, it's a great spot and now that I know volleyball is an option I'm pumped to check that out."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic visit and I cannot wait to go back.  It was pleasure to go somewhere different .. and especially a place bursting with personality.    Walking in from the parking lot. .view of the beautiful green lawn and sand volleyball court.. makes you feel like you are on vacation.. in a sense.   Walking into the Roadhouse..  plenty of bar stools open AND great service at the bar . Jukebox in the bar too!!! YES !!    The majority of the patrons were in the outside dining area..  and there were volleyball games commencing.    I loved the wing selections on menu..  definatey large menu of various items.. loved seeing asparagus etc.    I wished I hadn't had dinner.  We got the honey sirchia  wings and the Billy vs. Blast Furance wings.  Both were equally delicious.     Stella on tap too!!

The bar had these little signs (see picture) you can put on your drink when you use the loo.  I loved that!! Cracked us up.    I cannot wait to go back. 

Thanks Billy's Roadhouse..   no doubt one of my new favorite pubs.."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  My husband and I went there for dinner last night and I ordered a house salad.  It was disgraceful.  For $6.49, all I got was barely a cup of lettuce, 3 slices of cucumber and 2 cherry tomatoes.  It should have been described as a side salad -- in fact, I've gotten bigger side salads at Wendy's by far.  When I expressed my displeasure to the waitress, her reply was, \"I only work here; I don't make the prices,\" and then she walked away.  The restaurant should be ashamed of themselves.  It was pathetic.  My husband ordered a reuben, and while he thought it was merely okay, he said the mystery meat was tough.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was just average (had the Parmesan garlic wings and chili cheese fries). Music was great! Service was really good too!"}
{"text":"The food is usually good but the service here stinks - our waitress was rude and it always takes FOREVER for them to serve you"}
{"text":"Cool spot to watch some sand volleyball during the summer.  It would be nice if Happy Hour was until 7p.  Servers are nice and the food is really good.  Try the buffalo chicken dip with chips!  They have game day specials for all of the Pittsburgh teams, karaoke nights, live music regularly."}
{"text":"We met some friends from out of town over the holidays here.  After reading some of the reviews prior to going I was prepared for poor service.  So I was not all that surprised that the service was less than stellar.

The two bartenders spent more time talking to each other and sometimes took the time to interrupt their conversation to take an order.  That was when they where both behind the bar.  Most of the time one of the bartenders was on the phone and the other bartender disappeared.  More often than not it getting service required getting the bar back's attention for him to walk a few feet to get one of the bartenders  attention from their conversation to come over and take an order 5 feet from where they where gabbing.

It also turns out that they have a \"Drinks for a Buck Program\" if you see a Deer in the back of the place you are supposed to bring it to the bartender's attention and you get $1 drafts the remainder of your stay.  Not even knowing about the program I took a picture of a Buck and the next time we caught one of the bartenders attention (about 5 minutes) I showed it to the bartender who promptly told me that I couldn't get the \"Buck a Beer\" because she did not know when I took the picture.  \"What Buck a Beer\" program? I asked.  It was then that I found out about the promotion. I explained I didn't know about the promotion and this was my first time here.  \"There's no way I CAN know THAT\" was her response. I wasn't so much concerned about the promotion but more about the attitude.

The wings are very good though."}
{"text":"Tried the place based on a friend's recommendation...so glad I did!  The food was excellent.  It's been a long time since I had wings that good.  It's a small place, and it was a bit loud, so not the ideal place for a romantic dinner.  I saw other reviews that had difficulty with their service, but that was not the case for me.  My waitress was very sweet and never let my glass sit empty for long."}
{"text":"This could be a great local bar and used to be... In the past few years it has gone down hill swiftly.   Being from this area, have watched this place decline with each visit.  They have great wings but the service is the worst I have ever experienced in my life.  And each time I have been there they have run out of the liquor that I was drinking after two drinks were purchased.  What bar doesn't have ample inventory when liquor sales is where you make your money.  And I would like to add, I drink a very common liquor.  I felt as if I was bothering the bartender when asking for a drink and/or my bill.  There is never more than 2 or 3 people at the bar and you still get horrible service.  I left the place without leaving a tip.  This is the first time I have ever done this in my life.
Love to patronize the local non chain establishments, but Billy's Roadhouse will be crossed off of our list."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Saturday and the place was practically empty. We sat at a booth at the end of the bar. it took the waitress at least 5 minutes to even bring us menus and take our drink order and another 10 minutes to bring our drinks. Twenty-five minutes later I hear the bell ring from the kitchen and see our food sitting in the window but our waitress is so busy typing stuff into this antiquated POS system that she just ignored the bell. Our food sat under some heat lamp for another 5 minutes before she brought it to us. Just to get another drink took 5 minutes and she only had to walk literally 8 feet. I would hate to see how bad the service would be if they were busy. The beer faucets looked like they haven't been cleaned in years. They were green at the end. I would never order a draft beer here. I'm sure the soda gun was just as dirty but I couldn't see it. The food was average but definitely not enough to make up for the bad service."}
{"text":"///Adding a 20140622 note to the original review.  Now that we've found the Wexford Ale House as well as the word getting out about Whole Foods beer and dining area, Billy's will need to pay attention to the beer and tap line.  Billy's Roadhouse Burger remains excellent -- but the competition for the customer's interested in local beers is increasing.//////


This is a composite review that covers January to March 2014 -- 5 visits.  

Access -- easy access off of rt 19 N in Wexford.  Great parking.  Lighted and safe.  ATM on site.  Established business.

Food -- bar food but very well done/presented.  The kitchen is prompt and the service to the tables and bar is fast.  Food is hot on arrival.  The burger (Billy's Roadhouse) is old style classic with LOTS of fries.  The fried/breaded zucchini excellent -- do not order both of them... just too too much.

Clean, well maintained, and friendly service from all we've encountered thus far.  Restroom tidy.

They have different bands play there -- Mark Pipas is a well know Pittsburgh guy who has a wide range of music.  We haven't seen the other performers as of yet.  

Beers -- well, as an established bar, the tap is pathetic -- few if anything that resembles craft beer.  A few IPA's in bottles that do not represent the local brewery venue.  On this issue, the Roadhouse appears to be missing a market segment that knows/understands/ and appreciates interesting craft brews.  

Bocktown (both locations) knows this well and reaps the customer rewards of serving this audience.  Hint.  Hint.  

Just down the road Whole Foods Market has an excellent beer selection that Billy's should pay attention  to.  Whole Foods is now, actually, a food and craft beer venue and thus in competition with the Roadhouse.  Hint Hint.

Lots of TV screens for sports fans -- some might say the Roadhouse in a sportbars.  I leave this to others to determine.  But lots of TV's....

Billy's Roadhouse is a nice, local, community venue.  Relaxed, easy, expected service and food venues.  But perhaps not watching the competition as much as it should/could.

{"text":"Billy's is located just right off of 19 but it's easy to forget about. Not because of the food and ambiance, but because of the location. This is fine with me because when we went last Saturday night, it wasn't packed. We got a great seat, great food, and great service!

Billy's wings are delicious and made to order...not pre-sauced! The burgers are big and juicy and there are lots of different toppings to choose from. 

Great pub food and comfortable pub atmosphere. We hung out after dinner and watched the Pens game."}
