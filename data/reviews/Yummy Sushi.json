{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch while running errands in the plaza and notice this new place and so decided to check out if they have an a la carte menu. They did. The server gave me their folded printed menu (same as their take out menu).   And while I looked thru one of the servers pointed out to me that the daily and lunch specials on the back of the menu.  And on that same page I notice they also put \"15% off. For any purchase with us! Cash only. Expiry date will be informed in advance\".   The food was okay, not great. And so when they gave me the bill I asked for the 15% off as I will pay cash.  The server then told me that the discount special does not apply to the daily and lunch specials. I asked if it is expired they did not say so before \"in advance\". She said \"no\" it does not apply to the specials. WHAT!!! The same specials that is printed on the same page just above the 15% off notice does not apply.  I pointed out to them that it does not say that on the menu. So I just paid my bill and walked out. Not worth arguing over the stupidness of how they plan their printing as I do not plan to return to this place.   How do I add a picture to this review so you can see their menu."}
{"text":"I dropped in for lunch today,  and have been going to sushi restaurants for years, so ...  Miso,  watered down, flavorless,  bland  Sushi Maki,  unbelievable,  I ordered an assortment,  and they came covered in a sauce, the kiss of death to any true food lover.  This is a way to hide freshness, bad move on their part.  At this point I ordered one white tuna sushi just out of curiosity.  It was less than average so I moved on to the easiest part,  dessert.  Green Tea, and Red Bean ice cream with mango pudding. Both ice cream flavors came in the same bowl, economy for them, flavor clash for me. Taste was run of the mill, mango pudding was nothing special.  Service, rushed, never asked how the food was, lucky for them. Bill came close to $20.  Recommendations: Terrible sushi, run in the opposite direction unless you have no other option"}
{"text":"Nice small ayce sushi restaurant in Richmond Hill. I'd say it's one of the better ones in the uptown area. Have been here a couple times for the ayce dinner and have yet to be dissapointed with the food and service.  Menu is good, has pretty much most items that you see at an ayce sushi place. One of the more unique items that I have only seen here is the Golden Shrimp Tempura, where the tempura is crispy fried sweet potato and it's delicious! The short beef ribs are always made perfectly. Nice and juicy and not too chewy. Also love the mango sago dessert which is a huge plus. Sashimi has always been fresh and the waiters have never missed any of my orders.   Definately a must try sushi place and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Gave it a try since it is a newer place. We stuck with the ala carte menu as opposed to the AYCE option.  We knew we couldn't eat that much for lunch, and the lunch specials applied to the weekends too, so it was better value and healthier for us to eat and spend less.  Got that at 11am right when it opened on Sunday.  We were first customers.  Very clean and quiet.  Servers were nice and attentive.  Only thing was that since restaurant had just opened for business, the air con didn't really kick in yet and it was a bit warm.  It got cooler towards the end of our meal.  Ordered the fish katsu bento lunch special for 8.95.  Came with miso soup (not salty!  A plus for us!), salad, gyoza, pineapples, vegetable tempura, rice, and a side of California rolls.  Salmon Teriyaki entree 9.95 came as 4 thinly sliced salmon steaks on bed of shredded cabbage, carrots and bean sprouts. Miso soup, salad, and a bowl of rice were complimentary.  Tasted ok.  Ordered (grilled) salmon wrapped asparagus appetizer 6.50 as a child's meal.  Very cute dish.  Accompanied it with an avocado & cucumber roll 4.25.  Would've been cheaper to order the salmon teriyaki bento lunch special 9.95, but didn't want all the other fried stuff like tempura and gyoza.  Would come back here for cleanliness, quaintness, and service.  Food is ok, not the most spectacular Japanese food we had, but ok for this price point for entrees."}
{"text":"The food was good,not the servers. The servers were really rude! I wish the owner from this location could read this review. They really have to understand that customers not only paid for the food, but also paid for the service. I am 100% sure not to go back again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've ate here three times since they've opened, everything is just ok, I've ordered take out most of the time.  There is really nothing else that is that close to us which makes Yummy a default as it's close and on the way home from work.  Their 3 rolls for 9.99 is a good deal, and is usually what I get.  Nothing spectacular, but good and decently priced sushi."}
{"text":"This place has mediocre sushi with horrible service. They don't understand the concept of \"all you can eat\" it's more like all you can order at once since they kick you out after half an hour by giving you the bill. The waiter is horribly rude and demands tip. They sit in the back and ignore their customers. The only reason why I might consider coming here again is because there's no other sushi place in Richmond hill. Go to Kiku! Go to Wasabi! Yummy sushi more like crappy sushi."}
{"text":"I'm allergic to fish so unfortunately I can't review the sushi here, but my coworkers and I come here at least once a month. For $15 any day and any time, this place is great! Their fried rice, chicken skewers, dunplings, and shrimp tempura are delicious and the list goes on. Typically not busy, is clean and is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"We went to Yummy Sushi on a Friday night and it wasn't busy which caused us some concern at first.  When we looked at the menu, we were impressed with the selection of items.  We were hungry so we ordered a lot right from the get go. Our food came in no time.  It might have been due to the fact that it wasn't busy but the service was excellent.  The food was \"yummy\" and fresh. They don't use too much rice like some other places.   Although it is a bit pricier than some of the other AYCE sushi joints in the area,  it was well worth it.   Ambiance is a bit cold since everything is grey and black but it looks clean.   I will be going back again."}
{"text":"I love that they deliver. The order took some time (more than 45 mins) to arrive the second time, which was around dinner time, but the first time we ordered it came very fast (it was much later at night).   Food is good, nothing overly special - but we still enjoyed it. Prices are amazing! Their hand rolls are very good!"}
{"text":"This place is decent for all you can eat sushi but the take out is also pretty good also if you like maki rolls."}
{"text":"This is a review strictly on their takeout, I've never dined in.  We only go for the daily special for takeout which is 8.95 for 2 rolls or 10.95 for 3 rolls. Each roll comes out to 6 pieces. You have a decent selection to choose from and the rolls are tasty. Today I ordered the salmon avocado, spicy salmon and the salmon skin roll and my wife and I were happy with what we got.   Combo also includes miso soup and a salad.   Service didn't take too long, about 5-10 minutes for it to be ready but keep in mind I ordered take out on a Thursday afternoon.   3.5-4 stars"}
{"text":"AYCE here is at a pretty good price! The food isn't amazing but it's fairly good. The worst part about this restaurant, is the service. I would have given 4 stars if it weren't for the slow and inattentive service. There were only two waitresses for a room full of guests so they looked very frazzled and were quite rude. It was evident that they hated their jobs and really weren't courteous at all. When I asked questions about the food, one of them rolled their eyes and gave very dry answers.   Would come again for the food though! But, they need to get more waiters."}
{"text":"A year ago I would have given this place 4 stars. Times have changed in A those 12 months. The owners are now more \"greedier\". Firstly, they have removed items from the menu (example pan fried mackerel). Secondly the service is horrible. No smiles, no greetings, very brusque. Thirdly now they automatically charge you 10% service charge - this never happened before. And lastly in an obvious attempt to be greedy, they charge weekend price of $17.99 for lunch on a weekday (example today). Normal price on website is $14.99 but on the menu crossed off to read $15.99. Today is a Wednesday - they charge $17.99 per person. When I asked why I was told today is a holiday - apparently Valentine Day counts as a holiday! You just feel cheated. There was no need to charge weekend prices on a weekday. This leaves a sour after taste. I shall certainly no longer go there anymore for these four reasons. The 2 stars is for the food."}
{"text":"* Food is average * Place looks clean * Average priced * Average service and can get very busy at times"}
{"text":"This place is legit.  It's not the best sushi, but way above average sushi for the price.  Hungry and want the job done while satisfying your sushi craving?  This is your place.    As a person that hates AYCE, this place surprised me especially since Richmond Hill doesn't have many decent places."}
{"text":"Please avoid this place. 3 of our family members developed food poisoning after visiting this restaurant. I have contacted Public Health and they are investigating. As well, they charge a mandatory 10% tip. This is ridiculous considering they give their clients food poisoning."}
{"text":"I tried this ayce sushi place after reading some positive reviews. It become my favourite sushi place that night. It's a small restaurant but I've never had to wait. The staff are quick, friendly and smiling. The food was amazing and I'm pretty fussy with my sushi places. It was fresh, tasty and perfect temperatures. A few favourites are the salmon crunchy roll in rice paper, lemon chicken, fruit roll, red bean ice cream and the mango sago dessert. Only thing I wish they had is the dark green wakame salad and that their fresh mango in the dishes were more ripe."}
{"text":"AYCE was at a fair price and the food is decently yummy... that is, if it ever gets to you. The service is by far the worst I have ever encountered in a restaurant, almost to the point where we had to remind the servers how to do their jobs."}
{"text":"Ended up here by chance, as we came to the area for lunch, but the other restaurant was super busy. Just so happened this restaurant had quite a few open tables and we were in a rush.   Decided to go for a platter of sushi and sashimi, and another lunch bento between 4 people. The fish was pretty good, and quite fairly priced. We had about 45 pieces and everything was quite good. Also, the bento box was nice as well. Had the Pork Katsu, which was nice and crispy, just the way I like it. Overall quite average on the food.   Service seemed a bit on the rude side though, as they didn't say very much to us, had to ask multiple times for anything, and didn't see a smile cracked even once. Not the most welcoming and friendly staff.   A decent place, but a little out of the way as there are Japanese restaurants all over this area. Also prefer to visit a restaurant that has staff that are happy you're providing them with business."}
{"text":"It was random, I drove by and decided to give this place a try.    I'm s vegan now, so menu items can be scarced and lack luster in variety within the selections - however I saw their vegetarian bento box and decided it was worth the shot.    I sat in a very clean restaurant, the staff was friendly and the wait was under 10 min which wasn't horrible.  I was surprised when the young lady handed me with 5 containers packed into a plastic bag.    One container had 6 nice-sized avo-cucumber rolls with wasabi that I asked for, lots of ginger and it's own little container of soya sauce which was great because you can mix the wasabi directly inside the soya sauce and dip.  The next large container had about 7 fresh pieces of assorted vegetable tempura along with its own container of soya dipping sauce once again - perfect.  The 3rd container had a split portion of steamed rice along with 3 very big pieces of freshly made tempura tofu, and 3 fresh veggie gyoza (fried dumplings).    Then lastly there was 2 round containers of one each of miso soup and their house Japanese green salad.  I asked for hot sauce on the side $.50 extra.  Overall, for a meal under $12 tax in.. I was super impressed by the freshness, quality & portion sizes of everything.    Unfortunately no pictures this time though I'll definitely make a second trip to see if this is their consistent quality at Yummy Sushi.  So far so good!! A lil gem on Major Mackenzie just West of Leslie St. Between Bayview in Richmond Hill.  For a vegan I was actually quite happy!"}
{"text":"First time customer and by far one of the worst restaurant I have ever been. We went with a friend to celebrate my son's birthday. I didn't expect good service because I was warned in advance. We order a party tray, the first piece of tuna roll tasted funny, tried another piece and I was certain it was spoiled. I asked my friend to smell it and she also said it smelled spoiled.   We told the waitress and she kept saying \"it can't be because no one has complained today\". I told her to take it to the chef and have have him taste. She came back with the plate of tuna rolls and said the sushi chef said it was fine, nothing's wrong with it. They didn't even taste it because she brought back all 4 pieces. She continued to try to argue with me. At this point I was boiling, I told her to  exchange it to California roll. Then the other waitress came over and said rudely \"what's the problem?\".   After we paid the bill, I asked to speak to a manager or the owner. The waitress said the owner was not there. I took the business card and said I will call. I asked for the name of the owner and she appears to be clueless, turn to the other staffs and they told me to call tomorrow and just ask for the \"owner\". I was speechless...unbelievable!!!! Totally irresponsible, felt like they just want to cover up this whole instance. There's so many Japanese restaurants around, don't bother coming to this one!"}
{"text":"Yummy Sushi unfortunately did not have yummy sushi.  I came for dinner on a Sunday evening but I was let down by the food.  Upon entering I was impressed by the decor of the restaurant.  It was very modern, clean, and had a great feel!  This was the high point of my visit...  The sushi (my favorite part of most Japanese restaurant visits) was not good.  The salmon was old and on its last legs.  It was slimy and tasted old.  The sushi also had too much rice and the fish was cut too thin.  I had the spicy salmon crunch roll and while it tasted ok it was full of breading, which took away from the main ingredients.  The dynamite roll was quite good.  The rest of the food was hit and miss.  Their black pepper shrimp, coconut shrimp, cheese wontons, and squid dishes were good but I didn't like anything else we ordered.  The chicken karage, chicken cutlet, and lemon chicken were all horribly overcooked and bland.  We ordered a few other dishes that I didn't enjoy either.  The service was quick and our main waitress was pleasant and professional.  However the others that brought out our food clearly didn't want to be there.  Overall, I felt that this restaurant had a lot of potential but fell short.  Fresh fish, careful cooking, and a proper wait staff would turn this place around quickly."}
{"text":"My go to sushi place, best quality of all the places neighborhood that I've been to.  Most things are the menu are awesome with a few exceptions, not a fan of the beef teriyaki, miso soup isn't as good as most places. But literally everything else I've eaten on the menu has been awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends have been here and the food has always great! But they mixed up our orders with two other tables and we recieved food that we hardly touched. Overall, great service, friendly staff but I would like to recieve what I ordered next time."}
{"text":"$25.99 for AYCE and no sashimi?! That's a first for me. I always order sashimi when I go for all you can eat sushi, so right off the bat I'm not coming here again.   They have iPads to order from which seems to be becoming the standard lately, however I felt like options were limited. We kept ordering the same things repeatedly because the menu was smaller.   However the kitchen did do a good job making the food (except the things they forgot.. see below). Most of the things we ordered were delicious. Especially the beef teriyaki (see photo). The seaweed on the handrolls was nice and crispy.   On our first order, we probably ordered 12-14 different items. And about a quarter of those never came out. We waited without food on our table for about ten minutes before we flagged down a server to ask what happened. He went to the chefs and came back to say they're not sure and that things were busy and to just order it again. I'm talking four different items that we ordered which never came. And during the time that we waited, we got less hungry. You could say that's a good thing but I like to eat all I can (haaa) and try as many things as possible.   Finally the bill came and I didn't notice that they automatically added 10% gratuity. I gave them an extra 15% before realizing that the total seemed off. I hated to do it, but I asked for most of the extra tip back. Remember to pay attention to the receipt. They should advise us and not sneak it on like that. Because now they're getting a less than amazing review."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 2.5 stars I would but this place is just below average. We stumbled across this place because we were super hungry and needed to fill our stomachs asap. This was the first time that I walked into a restaurant with many Caucasians especially in Richmond Hill. It's your typical AYCE sushi restaurant, quick, no customer service and mediocre food. The sushi was alright a little bit weird tasting and didn't like how some of the rolls would fall apart as you pick them up. Most of the cooked stuff was alright, the udon soup tasted like just noodles with tons of random veggies in chicken broth and the teriyaki beef wasn't even real sliced beef but rather the hot pot beef that you buy at the Chinese store. The only thing that I actually liked was the Green Tea and Red Bean ice cream. I don't think I will come back here considering the quality of food."}
{"text":"First time here. I was looking for a nearby sushi restaurant. I am glad to find this one.  This is one of the few AYCE sushi restaurants that serves shiitake mushrooms. And overall has the best selection of veggie options. Clean place. Comfy booths. Friendly service. Reasonable price."}
{"text":"They used to be good, and now they are just terrible. After our last incident with Yummy Sushi where we specifically asked for NO MAYO on our sushi rolls (we are allergic to dairy) and the rolls came drenched in mayo and then the restaurant had the nerve to say \"you can just throw out the ones with mayo on them\" (seriously? We paid for those rolls and you were so cheap you weren't even going to refund us or resolve the issue?) we decided to give them ONE last chance. Worst decision ever. Once more, we asked for NO MAYO, NO FISH EGGS, and what happened? The rolls arrived with fish egg and mayo on them. We called the restaurant, and they didn't believe us. The manager actually came to our condo to see whether or not we were telling the truth. When he saw the evidence for himself, he was apologetic and refunded us for the rolls. I wish I could say this was the end of this review, but it's not. This time around, we got food poisoning from them. Sick for days. We know it was Yummy Sushi too because we hadn't eaten anything else that day. I have a mind not to call the Ministry of Health on this disgusting, filthy institution. IF YOU WANT GOOD SUSHI AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SICK, PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND EAT ELSEWHERE. THIS RESTAURANT DOESN'T CARE IF CUSTOMERS GET SICK FROM THEIR FOOD!"}
{"text":"still good food but most of the servers are such punks   highly recommend the mussels, crabmeat salad, and enoki beef rolls"}
{"text":"Great place for ayce lunch special for an affordable price but not including their sashimi. Only during dinner they offer sashimi. Their mussel is my favourite. Came here with my Husband a couple of times now. The parking is never full."}
{"text":"Worst sushi restaurant I have had the displeasure of eating at. The quality of every dish I ordered was very poor. Sashimi was of the worst quality I've had. Not one dish was satisfactory. Walked out feeling robbed."}
{"text":"All you can, sushi = never a valuable meal. Taste suitable mainly for teenagers and western folks who wants quantity over quality. Fish freshness is meh, acceptable. Service is not bad. Environment is enjoyable also.   No, I doubt I'll come back for a second round."}
{"text":"Horrendous service. My coworker and I have been twice- once for dine in and once for take out. Can't decide which experience was worse. They throw the menu at you and roll their eyes when you ask them a question.   Food is mediocre.   It's cheap, but I'd rather give my business to a sushi joint that wants it. Never going back again."}
{"text":"This new restaurant is clean and has great food and a modern atmosphere. I ate all you can eat and was pleasantly surprised because this place has the biggest menus out of all the AYCE sushi restaurants I've been to, as well as a lot of dessert options (which is awesome because I LIVE FOR DESSERTS). The green dragon roll was phenomenal and I also loved the fresh salmon sashimi and terra cotta. The staff are polite and friendly, the food comes out of the kitchen very quickly, and I also received a 15% off VIP card which was a nice touch. I am a happy (and full) camper. Definitely returning again!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time to have all you can eat sushi for dinner. The place was nice with good sushi. The place is well priced and the taste of the food was good for the price as it is low priced sushi but the food was good. The place is light and the height LED lighting inside which I found cool. The decor was caching as well. The service was slower than I expected."}
{"text":"We went to this place in the summer, we just needed a quick lunch on the run and decided to try it. The food was pretty good, but I was blown away by the server who came and went soundlessly, like a ninja, but was fully aware of everything that was going on and brought our salads (which we had checked off on the order sheet) before we even put our order in! He was FAST! So that earns the restaurant another star. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated in a modern style. I would go back."}
{"text":"This review is for an a la carte dinner, not all you can eat.  We ordered a bento box C, a teriyaki salmon main entrée, a Yummy sushi maki roll, and a beef roll appetizer.  Breakdown of review as follows:  The beef roll appetizer tasted pretty good.  There were 8 rolls.  For $6.95, it was decent food and good value.  I don't mind ordering it again.  The bento box came with a lot of food: tempura, teriyaki salmon, fried tofu, 3 pieces of salmon sushi, rice, soup and salad.  All the cooked food tasted average/okay.  I can't comment on the salmon sushi as I didn't try it.  For $12.95, it was average food and big portion.  If you are not picky and are a big eater, go for a bento box.  The teriyaki salmon main entree came with a bowl of rice, a starter salad and a miso soup.  The salmon was pretty good.  For $9.99, the portion was huge.  It was an outstanding value.  The Yummy Sushi maki roll was moist, soft and tasty.  I didn't find it necessary to add soy sauce for flavouring.  The rice to protein ratio was good.  The rolls didn't fall apart when picked up.  The overall portion was average only, however.  At $11.95, it was decent food and average value.  Food 3 stars.  +0.5 star for the value and portion.  If you order take out, there is an additional 15% discount when pay in cash, making the meal a very good value."}
{"text":"Very good selection of sushi sashimi and rolls. Yammy indeed! Money worth. Loved their appetizers, especially scallops and enjoyed the rolls a lot"}
{"text":"Since it's a buffet and cheap, I would say it's worth it if you can stomach a lot of mediocre food. The mango sushi roll was terrible, but otherwise the California and avocado tasted average (rice was definitely frozen though), but I'm not very picky (just hungry). The waitress was really nice though!"}
{"text":"Overall its a pretty good place for AYCE sushi. The only thing missing from the lunch menu is sashimi. But I ordered sushi either way (sashimi with rice).   We didn't get all the items ordered, so we had to tell them that were missing a few dishes. We asked 3 times about shrimp tempura.. They finally brought it. The shrimp tempura was really big and delicious though   But it was pretty busy (we waited 5 mins for a free table), so I guess its expected.  Meat here is the BOMB! Its fresh and yummy. If you like beef teriyaki, definitely order it. Incredible roll is pretty incredible as well"}
{"text":"Tasty, clean.. presentation of delivered sushi platter could have been a bit more refined. But the flavor was very good.  Everything delivered and the hungry folk were fed.  The teriyaki salmon are three salmon steaks on a bed of vegetables with a LOT of sauce.  Was surprised but flavors were good.  For the price, and presentation - could have done better. I'm rating their takeout."}
{"text":"Usually I get my money's worth at hear AYCE... The salmon sashimi is where that happens.. for a table of 3, we ordered 20 pieces and didn't even re-order... on type of sashimi re-ordered was tako.  Overall, none of us would never return to this AYCE."}
{"text":"Yummy Sushi has a la carte sushi and all you can eat. We had all you can eat sushi lunch for 2 ($15.99 each) on a weekend.  They have an extensive menu - there are lots of choices (and lots of typo's!). The rolls were decent in terms of filling to sushi, and I was glad that they weren't filled with excessive amounts of cucumbers (particularly for the eel roll which came with avocado instead). Presentation was meh for the rolls, but the salmon roses were decently well done for an AYCE place.   The BBQ beef ribs and the deep fried cheese wonton were good. I was surprised that they brought out the avocado salad so late after a number of kitchen and rolls had arrived (normally these come out first thing).  Good dessert options - ice cream in 5 flavours, mango pudding, strawberry jelly and deep fried banana.  I was annoyed at the number of flies that were flying around our table near the preparation area. And I think I killed a mosquito. Service was good and quick, but it wasn't that busy when we came to begin with. They gave us a beef fried rice that we didn't order, but they took it back without complaint - I like how they give you back a copy of the original order sheet.  They take credit card, but they don't take tap, so no Android Pay. :("}
{"text":"I've had Yummy sushi a few times. Their take out is good value for your money but it isn't the best. I've gotten the 3 roll combo which is around $11 and for the price, it was really good. The all you can eat is good as well, however I found it to be overpriced in comparison to other all you can eat sushi restaurants in the area. The service was good but I found that not all the front end staff were able to effectively communicate in English. Overall, it's a good restaurant but would recommend it more for takeout than for sit down."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend pretty late because we were craving sushi. The customer service was still great 20 mins before closing lol! It's a great AYCE restaurant. Must try: The incredible roll! It's so great."}
{"text":"2.5 Star   I just wish that Yummy Sushi is yummier.  A newly opened Japanese restaurant that serves both a la carte and all you can eat.   When you have a friend that is always hungry like mine who has cravings for hot pot for lunch at 11 am on nice summer day.... AYCE seems to be the only thing that can calm him down.  Service is excellent! We were even given a 15% off VIP card which is good till Sept.   Food though was so so. Most of the cooked food was a miss especially the chicken ramen that not using ramen noodles. Sushi, handrolls and maki rolls were quite standard. Dessert though was A-OK with more than 6 choices to choose from.   Price is good. $13.99 for lunch Mon-Fri plus 15% off for VIP. Gratuity is not included in the final bill as most other AYCE Japanese restaurants, so tip accordingly."}
{"text":"Great for all you can eat compared to any other place in York region BUT staff aren't friendly. They always act like they are annoyed you are coming to eat here. Other than that it is a great place for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"This is literally 10 minutes walk from my place, so needless to say, I'm a regular at the restaurant. Although it is a little bit more expensive than the usual sushi AYCE place, I'm willing to pay the premium for good location, selection and service.   The extensive AYCE menu is definitely a plus. It's really rare to see seaweed salad and shrimp tempura on a lunch AYCE menu. My favourite menu items are the mussel w/ sauce, beef enoki roll and crab meat tempura (sounds boring, but it really is terrific!).  I went for dinner once or twice, and I noticed that some of the sashimi slices were still frozen. When I bit down, there was a little bit of a frozen texture to the fish which wasn't that pleasant.    Other than that, the decor was on point, the atmosphere was relaxing (excellent, nostalgic soundtrack is always playing in the bg) and the restaurant is really clean. I recommend this place to my friends all the time and I will continue to dine here over and over again. :)"}
{"text":"Quality of food was quite good, selection of meat for the beef ribs was great relative to some of the other places I've been to. Service was top notch and food came out at a good pace.  The selection of deserts was not lacking in any way though mostly limited to ice cream, no complaints there though. In terms of the entrées the quality was decent and there was a good selection, (though the fried rice could do with a little more flavour)  Sushi was pretty much average, no issues there"}
