{"text":"Nice vegetarian choices. I've been looking for a decent downtown Roti shop since the Roti Lady of Dunn Avenue moved. Good options for how spicy you want them cooked."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 10 years and it's the best trini roti in the city, wide variety of drinks, amazing doubles, vegetarian and meat curry are both excellent. Ask for squash in your roti and they don't charge you anything extra. The roti is always fresh, and the prices are great. You don't go here for ambiance (unless you dig the retro 80's feel and uneven tables) and their customer service can have it's weak days, but the food is prepared lightning fast, and  it is always delicious."}
{"text":"NOOOOOOO!!! Are you gone for good?? Did you move somewhere (please say yes)??? Your doubles were the best I have ever had. I used to love blowing people's minds by sending them here. Please say it ain't over!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian spot.  I brought one of each veg option to a party and they were all excellent.  I've been back twice in the past two weeks.  A real gem."}
{"text":"3.5 stars to be accurate. The chicken roti is pretty good. The goat roti is even better, especially with the hot sauce. The decor and ambiance in the place are poor at best so I always take out. The service leaves ALOT to be desired, although it comes fairly quick and it's not too expensive, so for what it is I would say try it and see what you think."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 15 times over the past 3 years and I like it better than Pam's Rotis and One Love Vegetarian, but I haven't tried any other places. Nothing really wrong about the place, it's definitely the best roti in the area. I always get a spicy chickpea roti with random additional veggies (spinach/squash). Not really sure what to expect from the doubles, had them twice and they seemed good. If you get a chickpea roti there's no point, and they can be super messy. The place is nothing to look at but they have a lot of seating and lots of unusual imported drinks in the fridge, but I stick to take-out. You can call ahead and do that to streamline the process, but it's really not necessary."}
{"text":"Love this place. Rotis and curries are delicious. One of my two fav carribean spots in the city. If you're interested the other is Cool Runnings located at Main and Gerrard."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the simple atmosphere and mediocre service (rarely with a smile): I believe this to be the BEST Caribbean roti in the city, especially for vegetarians. The eggplant, pumpkin and spinach combo is a taste of heaven (chick peas and potatoes are always complimentary fillings here). Considering their central location, it would be great if this place was open later."}
{"text":"This is not 5 Star Fine Dining so I am puzzled as to why people are complaining about kindness.   Get yourself a HOT chicken roti with mango juice and take a couple of doubles to go.... THE BEST."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I've had the ability to form memories. Imo hands down the best place to get roti in Toronto if not, Canada? Need more data. Highly recommend the boneless chicken roti. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"TASTY FOOD, SO-SO SERVICE  I have been going to this place for over 15 years!  Moreso many years ago, because sadly, it has gone downhill.  Pros: Rotis have good, distinct flavour Cons: Portions seem to get smaller all the time; Service is usually poor  15 Years ago I would have given this place a 4 or even a 5.  Now it gets a 3.  Here is a short anecdote from the last time I went.  There was some sort of mixup with the customer in front of me, and he left in a huff.  When I got my order (to go), I had a sneaking suspicion that it wasn't what I had ordered, and the surly woman behind the cash knew it, but figured I wouldn't complain.  I didn't want to be too anal, and figured I was wrong, so I got on my bike and went home.    When I got home and opened the paper bag, I found a goat roti (with extra bones, if that's possible!) instead of the boneless chicken I had asked for.   Blech.  I had KD that night, and though I am sure I will give them another chance sometime, I haven't been back in months."}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to find good West Indian food and it's been surprisingly difficult in this city.   Maybe it's because the food is too spicy for some in it's original style so many places make their food mild so as not to offend delicate constitutions. Maybe there are just a lot of places that make average to good food but I haven't found many GREAT places.   I had the pleasure of checking out Caribbean Roti Palace earlier this week with Kat F. and Susan C. and our opinions were rather divided. I'm hoping they'll do reviews too so I can hear what they thought of the place.  I thought the food was quite good. There was heat but not so much that it overpowered the food. The roti itself was a little powdery but good and held together well. I've had many a roti fall apart from sogginess over the years. I'm going to have to go back and try a few more things to get a better idea of what's what.  The Palace itself is a nice little place. There might be seating for about twenty to thirty people and I like that my order was written on my napkin. Kat was quick to point out how odd it was that our napkins had writing on them when there was a brand spankin' new computer at the front to process the order in the first place. Oh, and I love the little cafeteria trays that your food is served on. Priceless.   There was a nice young man just waiting for his order that fell victim to our loud conversation. He said that he liked seeing new people come in so I'm guessing that he's a regular. It's always good to see regulars and talk to them because it's the only way to get the inside dirt without spending years figuring it out for yourself.  All and all I've got to say that Caribbean Roti Palace is right near the top of a short list of good eats. I'm still on the look out though so if you know about a great place send me a note."}
{"text":"Closest thing I will get from the West Indian ladies from my moms church. These are the best rotis you will get in the Annex. No offence to One Love Vegeterian. It's not just the roti that is delicious. You can get peanut punch, pink ting's and sorel! Oh and the phoulorie and doubles are out of control! I tried everything on the menu last summer. The staff is wonderful too! Always have a smile on their face."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this place. The roti us mostly a load of roti wrap with very little filling. It's not a healthy food and not delicious at all."}
{"text":"The roti was amazing but I had a really difficult time cutting it with plastic cutlery while dining inside. I have problems with my left hand so plastic cutlery is really difficult for me to use. I asked politely for proper silverware/aluminium ware but was rudely told to use the plastic and that they did not have anything else. So the food is good but the attitude and the service is nothing to write home about. I will only do take out here - but probably will go to a place that has respect for customers as this place does not."}
{"text":"I really do like the curry goat roti here. In fact that's all I've purchased and I've been back a number of times.  They've been in business a long time and I do sometimes wonder why they don't renovate the place to make it look a bit better because I think this IS the original decor. They MUST have the funds for it after being in business so long. That's my only 'complaint'. The curry goat roti is great."}
{"text":"Here used to be pretty good for a trini style roti but the portions have gotten smaller while prices have gone up. There are better options around."}
{"text":"You don't come here for the decor (though I do love the faded beach photographs that are a roti shop staple), you come here for the doubles! Super fresh, warm and wondrously pliable baras (the fried bread) stuffed with flavourful curried chickpea filling. Don't forget the hot sauce! You will inevitably scamper back to the counter for another double after you inhale the first, so you best order two off the hop.   Nice variety of vegetable roti options to boot."}
{"text":"Another negative experience for me at The Roti Palace!!! :(    The last time I was in the roti palace was a year and a half ago after finding a long black hair wrapped around a piece of meat in my beef roti. Yuck! I actually went to the bathroom and threw up!! As I was chewing on the meat I felt something and pulled a hair out of my mouth which was like a mile long...... it was the grossest thing I've ever experienced!!  .  So today I found myself in the area and decided to give the Roti  Palace another shot, before the long black hair experience  I've been coming here for years and really enjoyed there roti. As I ordered my beef and chicken roti to go-$17.65-I did mention the long hair experience to the guy behind the counter he was either the owner or a relative-he didn't even blink an eye and was to busy playing some kind of number game on a Piece of paper. He Never Acknowledged what I said to him and never apologized. He just looked at me stone-faced. Wow!!! If  he would  have apologized  to me I would never have written this negative review because I didn't write a negative review last year when i found the long nasty hair... because like I said I really enjoyed this place   but I won't be back and I won't recommend this place to friends or family he really needs to work on his Customer service.  And  God for bid if I find another hair in my Roti..... I will just die!!!"}
{"text":"My husband (who is from Trinidad) and I visited the restaurant on our recent trip to Toronto and we both loved it. The doubles were as good as the doubles we got in Trini and much better than any doubles we have found in the DC area where we live. The Roti as well as the boneless chicken were also delicious. Prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"The rudest experience I've ever had. Twice. Good food, horrible people.   Don't get me wrong, the food is good. You can't deny it. BUT, to go in a restaurant and drop $20 on a roti and a drink - I added extra filling - and then be scolded, lambasted and insulted for requesting an extra thimble sized plastic cup of hot sauce is just not right. Truth be told, this happened to me before, but I thought I'd be nice and give them the benefit of the doubt. Everyone has a bad day no doubt. Well, first it was the wife - I assume - and the second time, the husband. I politely ask for a thimble of hot sauce and without hesitation, he shakes his head and absolutely loses on me ranting about the price of hot peppers and so on. It was surreal and quite honestly, had I not been so embarrassed, I was tempted to throw my roti at him. Yes, it was that bad. The worst part was seeing the $20 bucks I just gave to to a man that was yelling at me like he caught me fooling around with his wife. I've never felt this angry in a restaurant in my life.  My two cents? Go to Ali's. The food's good and so are the people."}
{"text":"The food was good, I have never had Roti before, though the establishment itself, and the atmosphere, etc. is not what you would call High-End. Feels like it's meant to be really quick, maybe just take out. There are chairs and tables, but not the kind you'd take a date if you were trying to impress them.  Great for friends wanting to try something new though!"}
{"text":"I like this place because it has the best doubles in the city. The roti is okay, I like the goat definitely more than the chicken. Also, the pholourie is to tie for with the Tamarind sauce. Ordering ahead is nice too."}
{"text":"Very good prices, and very yummy!"}
{"text":"One of the better Trini curries I've tried in Toronto.  The curry had a nicely spiced gravy and the food was piping hot.  But the staff there look almost miserable at times and so eating there was not the happiest of occasions!"}
{"text":"Roti Palace has the best roti flavour in town in my opinion.  The restaurant appears to be a bit squalid from the outside and the inside is not much better.  Dated pictures of the Caribbean hang haphazardly on the wall and the floors seem to have a fine layer of perma-dirt.  However, it seems to be very authentic West Indian food and delicious to boot!  I am not sure what spices or ingredients are that they use in the roti sauce, but it is what I would imagine crack to be to a crack head, extremely addictive!  The boneless chicken roti is my personal favourite which has a delicious potato filling; however, the goat is also very tasty and you may feel pretty exotic eating goat.  The rice and peas are also scrumptious. Again I am not able to discern what flavour makes it so mouth-watering.  The service is usually speedy for take out and they are pleasant enough, although at times they may appear disgruntled.   I recommend the Caribbean Roti Palace."}
{"text":"My go-to place when I'm homesick and need my doubles & banana solo fix!   The doubles and phoulorie are delicious! They make their food very comparable to food back in the Caribbean. They have great beverage selections just like back home in good ole Trinidad.   Ambience isn't 5 star but it's exactly what you get when going into roti shops in Trinidad. No complaints from me though, the owner is very pleasant to me and my friends. The food is delicious. The tamarind sauce is my favorite!!! I recommend this place to all my fellow Trinis and friends who want food as authentic as it gets in Toronto.   Trust me, I've scouted all over the GTA for good doubles and roti, this place is hands down the most authentic and the best."}
{"text":"As a Trinidadian child, you're taught 2 valuable lessons: - DO NOT trust curry from just anyone - DO NOT trust people when they say they can make roti  Roti Palace was the only place my dad trusted to make Trinidadian roti. I was taught not to trust any other place for \"real\" roti...except my aunt. And she lives in Ajax. Roti Palace is closer.  Sometimes the roti is made a little thin. Other than that, it's just like being in Trinidad. The pepper is perfectly hot and the boneless chicken roti usually has my mouth watering before the first bite. One bite and I start talking like my parents.  I usually wait until I'm in Trinidad to have roti because (as with most cultures), the roti back home doesn't compare to the roti made locally. But when the trips to Trinidad are few and far between, Roti Palace is the next best thing for me."}
{"text":"I had walked by this place many times on my way to Bloor St. but until a friend recommended it to me I never went inside. Squeezed in just south of Honest Eds, Caribbean Roti Palace opens up to be a surprisingly large restaurant. The decor inside is fine but rather plain and unedifying which can make dining in less pleasant than it should be. You can get your order to go though.  What really matters at a place like this though is the roti and it's fantastic. The rotis here are large, and very flavorful. I'm not the most experienced roti eater but I can tell the ones at Caribbean Roti Palace are well made. The boneless chicken roti with hot sauce is my personal favorite.  For less than ten dollars you can get a really filling and delicious meal. If the atmosphere inside was a little nicer I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"One does not go to Caribbean Roti Palace for service or ambiance. Despite these two very lackluster areas, it still gets four stars due to the tasty roti.  I have had a consistently positive experience with the food. I always have a 2 veg roti or shrimp roti - never been disappointed.  This place is a dive and the service is cold at best, but it is one of my favourite places to get a roti-fix!"}
{"text":"Whoever has tried their food, agree that it is very authentic and tastes amazing. It is a small run down place, not the prettiest, but once you see the ladies working the kitchen, you know you will get amazing home made soul food. The doubles are to die for, the roti is the best, the curry potatoes are like no potatoes I've ever had! The best!!!"}
{"text":"How come this place gets no love? The boneless goat roti and veg roti are the best I\"ve had in Toronto.   Granted, roti preference is a fickle beast. I'm not a fan of the Real Jerk bone-in style, where others swear by it. The rotis here are superb. They are made quickly but with care and lots of love.   The location is amazing but the decor is food court sad. Get it to go and you'll be one happy camper.   And YES, I'm saying it's miles better than Bacchus."}
{"text":"Scrumptious curry goat with rice! The taste was delicious and it was served hot. The staff was also very nice and courteous. Don't forget to ask for their hot sauce, as that is what enhances the flavor of the goat. I would've given them 5 stars but the only reason for the 4 stars is because they only have boneless curry goat. Bones and marrow really add to the flavor but unfortunately they don't have the goat with bones. Nevertheless, the dinner was delicious. Will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Old decor and vintage feel, I like the staff, the food is the reason it's lasted so long. Terrific roti, rice. Definitely worth trying.  I like the fact they write your order down on your napkin, who does that?"}
{"text":"This place is probably the best roti in toronto, I've tried them all and nothing is even close. Roti is delicious shrimp roti my favorite with some pepper sauce real pepper sauce, the doubles is really good which is hard to find in toronto. The doubles is similar to the ones back home."}
{"text":"I finally checked out this place tonight. To be honest I was a little disappointed, from the other reviews here I was expecting better.  My friend and I shared a boneless chicken roti and we also shared a plate of 1 of each of the veggie side dishes (squash, eggplant and spinach)  Everything we had was BLAND. The roti wasn't very flavourful. It was wrapped very nicely and had great texture, didn't fall apart easily. But the chicken inside just didn't have much flavour.  The veggie side dishes were all \"meh\" too.   It was cheap ($13 for the whole lot) and I have only had roti from a few other places, but this was pretty mediocre food in my opinion.  Service was decent, lady taking our order was friendly enough and the food came out really fast...like...30 seconds? When I've had roti at other places it was made fresh, this must have been ready to go because it was served to us pretty much immediately after we ordered and wasn't very hot."}
{"text":"The chicken roti tastes good.   But the portion size is tiny, and there is a high ratio of roti to chicken.  Again, it's a good Roti, but I'd have to order two to even consider being full at lunch."}
{"text":"Found out months ago that this hole/dive was closed..... GOOD ! It seemed to me that to be employed there required you to have NO customer service skills whatsoever as you were never greeted with a \"Hello, take care, see you again\" or even a smile.Whenever you ordered a Roti you had to open it up and search it first to see if you found any foreign substances inside. My sister found a hair in her Roti and immediately lost her appetite. The \"restaurant\" always had an  air of uncleanliness about it anyway and I'm glad I only went there around 5 times. Should've never went back after the FIRST visit. I'd like to rate this place -5 but seeing as how you are not permitted to give the subject 0 stars I'll give it a 1..... but I don't mean it. Won't miss this place either."}
{"text":"God, I love this place. Every week, I come here and get a boneless chicken roti, a doubles and a bottle of Ginger beer.  Some weeks, I love it, some weeks, I love it but my body, she no love it so much.    Either way, it's great.  My vegan friend enjoys their spinach roti, so that pretty much has someething for everyone.  The menu is narrow, but delicious. You must go here."}
{"text":"A Trinidadian friend considers the doubles here better than what she grew up on in her youth back in Trinidad. I can picture her now explaining how they evoke her childhood and almost bring tears to her eyes, and insisting that I must go. Now they almost make me mist up too, although I don't have the same emotional connection she does to this gem of a restaurant. Their doubles, for me, are a culinary touchstone of Toronto (right up there with Mother India's East Indian-style roti) and I tell everyone who will listen how much they need them in their life. At $1.50 a pop, I can eat about three before I almost pop, although I still want more. They are wet, ungainly, incredibly fragrant pockets of fried bready wrapper with warmly spiced chickpea curry inside. I hope that they remain a Bathurst institution for years to come. The roti is good, too."}
{"text":"Had the chickpea roti, it wasn't wrapped tightly enough so it started falling apart as I was eating it, but it tasted great. The roti was really soft."}
{"text":"Best roti I have found in town.  The shrimp are plump and juicy.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"When you need something authentic and spicy, go here during the day.   Doubles, rotis, tings, you can't go wrong. This place literally fed me for 2 years and always did it with a smile. Feels like home going in there even though i'm not Caribbean."}
{"text":"I love the roti here, especially the chicken roti, the potato roti and the chickpea roti.  It's full of curry flavours and is very satisfying.  You can get it with a nice flavourful spicy sauce.  The prices are very reasonable.  I would get take out instead of stay in.  If I had a Trinidadian mom, I'd expect her to make a tasty, homey roti such as this."}
{"text":"This food is delicious and healthy. I like to get the squash and spinach roti and I love the doubles too, my favourite that I have had. There's not really much else to say but I am a big fan of this place, it's just really simply made and delicious food. Really unassuming atmosphere and quick service. I usually just take it home cause it's by my house."}
{"text":"Caribbean Roti Palace is a hit-or-miss.  I'll start with the obvious. Caribbean Roti Palace is ridiculously cheap. You can get a full meal for less than $10 dollars. You won't believe the amount of food you get for the price. Be warned---these are usually the prices at most Roti places in Toronto so cheap prices shouldn't be a deciding factor when deciding where to get your Roti fix.  Is Caribbean Roti Palace is worth it?   On a good day, at lunch hour, I'd say maybe. The roti is a little bit too \"doughy\" for my taste and it falls apart way, way too easily. I took two bites before I had to start using a fork.  On a bad day, at supper time when the food has been sitting there all day, I'd say avoid it like the plague. Caribbean Roti Palace's \"hit\" factor is completely dependent on the freshness of the food.  Take my nightmare experience as an example.   Last time I went to Carribbean Roti Palace, I went there at around 6pm. I ordered the usual: Boneless Chicken Roti and Curry Goat and rice. The meal was disgusting. The rice tasted like it was at least two days old. The curry goat was bland and cold. To be honest, the meal was probably one of the worst I've had in Toronto. I had a few bites, and then threw everything out.   I am sure there are better Roti restaurants out there."}
