{"text":"We have never eaten in the restaurant, but our family has ordered pizza from Odyssey many times.  It's traditional pizza with a fairly thick (and delicious!) crust, tangy sauce and ample toppings.  The pizza in my mind is up there with Spiros, Volos and other similar restaurants.  I can't comment on service but delivery has always been prompt and accurate, and our pizza has arrived hot.  One of our faves, time and time again!"}
{"text":"I was here to pick up an order for take-out was not impressed with the attitude from one of the servers here.  At the entrance you either go left for the lounge or right for the dining room (if you can even call it that).  Since no one greeted me and I saw employees in the lounge I decided to go there.  With five or six VLT's, jerseys hung with clothes hangers and a bunch of flat screen TV's it was reminiscent of basement from the 80's that's trying to be a sports bar.  When I finally go the attention of a server and let her know I was there to pick up an order she didn't really say anything coherent, just turned around and walked away.  I assumed I'd just wait by the washroom wall.  After waiting patiently for approximately 10 minutes I decided to ask the same server for an update on my order.  You see, she was acting very busy (training one other employee) but the place wasn't very busy (probably only 30-40% full).  I could tell other guests in the place were getting frustrated, wanting to order more drinks.  I stopped her and politely asked, \"Hi, I'm just wondering on the status of my order? I just wanted to check.\" She rolled her eyes at me and said, \"It's still not ready.\"  There was no mention of her double checking my order or even being sorry it was taking so long.  I walked back to where I was standing and waiting a few more minutes.  By this time I was getting tired standing so I sat at one of the empty tables.  A few more minutes go by and then she comes out with my order, drops the pizza on the table, \"there's your pizza\", drops a bag \"there's your hot items\", drops another bag \"there's your cold items\" then turns around and walks away.  I was appalled at this level indignation.  I have never encountered any employee working in a service related business that was this rude for no apparent reason.  For this I will never go back here again."}
