{"text":"Brilliant place to eat real greek food in the heart of downtown Toronto. I was surprised at the prices as I was expecting sky high prices, but the restaurant is very reasonable. The food seems very authentic and there is a quite a mix of meats, seafood etc. Definitely worth a try if you like Greek Food. We had the Lamb Shank, Zuccini Tower and the Philo Pastry thing in the mains and everything tastes delicious, good quantity and fresh !"}
{"text":"Thanks for a great meal and excellent service with Addy! We had a fun time and truly enjoyed the food especially the avolegmo soup!"}
{"text":"Tried three apps, scallops, octopus and salad.  Apps are a bit on the small side but I guess given the location (right by the Bay street area) it's to be expected.  Octopus was a bit overdone but the scallops were quite good.  Our main was the lamb exohico which I highly recommend.  Will definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food, great service although our waiter was a little rude with us. But all around a great place to have some good Greek food"}
{"text":"I love Greek food and this is definitely somewhere I will go again! We shared a few apps - watermelon and feta salad, calamari and cucumber soup which were all great. The soup was really good, cold and refreshing and I think it might have actually been good after the entree too - not as dessert but more a palette cleanser. 
The moussaka was incredible! Huge portion though. My friend had the seafood salad and said it was quite good as well."}
{"text":"Best Greek Restaurant in Toronto

I have found that Greek restaurants in Toronto are not 100% authentic but have changed somehow their taste and dishes to be closer to NA standards.
e.g. what is well known as Greek salad you will never find it in Greece.
However Volos offers a good balance between traditional and fusion Greek cuisine as well as including chef's elements and ideas. 
All plates are very well prepared and give you certainty that ingredients are carefully chosen.

The place is very nice, well decorated and gives off a Mediterranean scent.

Service is very good and friendly.

Overall pricy but taking into account the area it is located and the quality provided could be justified.

Hint: Try a tsipouro or ouzo (if you are having seafood) as your starting drink. Loved the variety of Greek wines, if you like wine you will be surprised tasting the underestimated Greek wines - some being unique varieties. (minus - prices for some labels are off the roof) 

Must try: Ntolamdes, soutzoukakia, saganaki (you won't get away from the \"opa\" cliche), frikasse, moussaka, exohiko (great but not suggested for those who would like to taste something light), being a saffron fan I loved the ice cream.

Overall you might disagree on the prices or service or even the decoration but it is almost impossible not to enjoy the food, even if you just returned from Greece."}
{"text":"Great Greek food, have been here several times for corporate and social events and always a great experience. The seafood is great, particular favourites are the fish, octopus and scallops.

Volos also has a great wine list to match! 

Location is great as is the ambience of the place."}
{"text":"Got to say from start to finish, this was an awesome experience.  We ended up getting a late dinner spot and table near the bar due to the winterlicious crowds but with a few smiles and some pleading faces we were moved to better seating at the centre of the restaurant.  Felt much more lively and less dark than the front.

For the vino-lovers who are hesitant about Greek reds, this place has some decent offerings.  They were even kind enough to provide us with not one but THREE different samples before we found one we liked.  I didn't even know sampling was an option!  I was nearly won over by that alone.

I ordered off the Winterlicious menu and got the Tiger Prawn Saganaki, Braised Lamb Shank and Saffron Pistachio Ice Cream.  Every thing was well prepared, beautifully presented and completely devoured!  The dessert was certainly a standout.  I'm not a big ice cream fan but it was recommended and totally worth it.

Overall great service, good ambiance and lovely food. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We decided to do early dinner on a Saturday. Suprisingly the place was busy with the pre-show crowd. We go seated next to the window. The ambiance of the place was really nice. Our server was a tad on the cold side, no smile or pleasantary, which was off putting. 

For our meals, we shared the exochio, a nice lamb spinach pastry. The meat was well cooked and delicious. The seafood kritharoto dish was a large portion of risotto, with ample amount of shrimp, squid and salmon.

For dessert, we tried the baklava which was fairly standard fare and the pressed greek yogurt with morroccan figs. This was my first time having pressed greek yogurt, definitely liked the taste and texture."}
{"text":"Ambiance was mid-range fine dining, and service was excellent and unintrusive.  The strange thing was the ceiling.  It looked like they forgot to build something to cover up the exposed ceiling with black wires.

The food:
Psarosoup - too fishy tasting (not in a good way).  It's a sign that the seafood isn't the freshest.

Tiger Prawn Saganaki - way toosalty.  The salt overpowered the natural flavour of the prawns.  What is the point of eating prawns if you can't taste the sweet natural flavour? 

Wild pacific salmon - very fishy tasting, albeit good texture.  I'm from the west coast and I love salmon, but I cannot stand salmon that's not fresh.  I've actually never had pacific salmon that tasted this bad before, and I eat salmon all the time.

Ouzo Chocolate Mousse - This was very rich and really good.

Traditional Baklava - my dining partner liked it, but it was too sweet for me.

Overall, the seafood here is quite terrible by my standards, but perhaps I'm a west coast seafood snob haha."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  So much good about this place.  I loved the room itself.  It was upscale but still had some nice Greek details."}
{"text":"We went on a Sat. night at a very busy time of year based on Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed.  The restaurant is very large and the decor is modern, not to mention the great location.  The wait staff is very knowledgable and professional.  Our server Phil suggested a mix of apps and we loved them all.  Our group ordered the rack of lamb, two different fish and cornish hen and we enjoyed them all.  We had deserts and Volos surprised us with a small taste of greek desert wine, lovely way to thank us and cap off a perfect evening.  We were satisfied with the portion sizes but  if you have a big appetite you may need to get into the bread basket. We will go again."}
{"text":"This was my first Greek cuisine experience in a while and Volos did not disappoint. In fact, I may never be able to go a different Greek restaurant. We had two apps - the sesame crusted feta and the saganaki, and I highly recommend both. They didn't come out at the same time, but it did not affect our experience whatsoever. For entr√©es we ordered the moussaka and stuffed Cornish hen. Again, both were simply fantastic and we paired them with a simple red wine. Finally, we finished off our unforgettable dinner with baklava. I really wanted to order more, but I could not eat even one more bite. Our server, Christos, made the experience even better; he was knowledgeable, helpful, kind and always knew when we needed more wine. I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Great decor. 

We got the saganaki with the Yelp check in. It wasn't something I would eat again. But that's personal preference. 

The grilled octopus was delicious. But the server took our plate away before we were finished. Would have liked to finish our appetizer since we are paying to eat all of it. 

I ordered the sea bass with potatoes and asparagus. It was just amazing. It was perfectly cooked. And yes it has bones in it that can get in the way. But it definitely didn't take away from the experience. Bf got the lamb shank with the feta mashed potatoes which he finished pretty quick. He liked it and i tried his as well ( so good!).  

Good atmosphere. Decent wine. And very tasty food. We would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I have long waited for the chance to go to a proper Fine Dining Greek contemporary restaurant in Toronto.  The new Volos Estiatorio finally fits the bill. I am a happy woman. After two visits the new restaurant meets all of my expectations. Terrific service, fantastic food and comfort.

Andreas the owner, who is generous with his time, is also extremely charming (he **should** be part of the menu LOL). He has combined culinary originality, fresh quality ingredients and mediterranean and middle eastern ideas to craft an interesting and expressive menu. 

The appetizers surprise us with their modern plating, unique flavor profiles, and an evident traditional foundation. A natural born Greek like me can definetely appreciate the effort that went into this. The sesame crusted feta, soutzoukakia meatballs and mediterranean octopus are to die for.

There are some interesting Greek varietals from small-run Greek wineries and you should take the opportunity to taste some Greek wine you are not likely to find on the Danforth.

The mains....do yourself a favour and order like a Greek not like a tourist. The signature dish, exohiko, is a phyllo-wrapped lamb pastry that not only melts in your mouth but also in your dinner companion's...it's that good.
 
Leave enough room for the Saffron pistachio ice cream."}
{"text":"We were looking for a restaurant near to the opera house, so we tried Volos--3 minute walk.  Nice modern-Greek style interior. (We were able to get a 5:30 pm reservation so we could get to our performance.) I ordered a delicious arugula salad and seared scallops--so good. Husband had a tomato-feta salad and salmon--he said it was great. We shared a Metaxa-macerated fig and yogurt dessert which was really good--that, alone, is worth the trip! Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly staffs and nice dinning environment. The food is not pricy but fresh and delicious. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I love that I don't have to go to the Danforth and I love that their menu has plenty of small sharing plates/appetizers.

Unfortunately I booked dinner at 10:00 pm, we were post Mary Poppins and starving!  Since their website took late reservations I thought it would still be a fun place to have a late dinner.  We were the only ones there, bummer.  They were really trying to rush us to order and get us out so they could close up and leave.  After a few minutes with the menu the waiter asked us to quickly order as the kitchen was about to close.  

We ordered alot of food, since there would be no chance to order more. The waiter told us it was to much for us and to get rid of one item, so we did.  I wasn't to much, we were pretty hungry, oh well.  The food we had was delicious and I would definitely go back for dinner again.  The octopus was amazing!

The server was pleasant, I just think that if they take reservations late, the kitchen should stay open long enough for us to have dessert."}
{"text":"Our first time.....Brittany was an awesome server! Answered all our questions and did it so we understood and didn't make us feel stupid for asking. The Greek wine that she recommended was right on! The food for a first timer....amazing! Grilled octopus for an appetizer, very good!  The main meal of lamb shank and veal was amazing!  The baklava was the best! Also we decided to try the Greek brandie, so smooth! Thank you so much! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Great glasses of wine, and a wonderful mousakka. It was just the right portion and tasted very bright and fresh. I ordered the grape leaves as a starter, and they were served with some fresh tzatziki, that really made these different and memorable. I will be back!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but the veal is delicious and the moussakka is quite outstanding. Meal seemed like it was cared for, the drinks were awesome too."}
{"text":"Hands down VOLOS served up some of the best greek food I've had in the GTA.  Service was attentive and atmosphere was intimate.  Would return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"More like a 2.5.  We were disappointed with the exohico. The dishes were over-salted. When we brought it to the attention of our server, she said feta cheese is salty & didn't offer to make things right. Great mojitos. Would return for drinks, but not to eat."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a late dinner after the opera.  Our server was pretty bad, he lacked any personality, didn't smile and one of our party finally had to ask another waiter for lemons after ours forgot twice. 

The food though was excellent which is why it didn't get 1 or 2 stars.  The appetizer octopus was some of the best I've had anywhere. 

The other waiters who came to our table were fantastic so perhaps another visit to Volos might be in order as most of the bad experience we had was centred around 1 person."}
{"text":"Volos is one of my favourite restaurants in the city! The service is always spectacular, the saganaki blows my mind, the exochico couldn't be more amazing and the chocolate mousse is mouth watering delicious. To finish this post let me give everyone some advice, go to Volos, I promise you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We must have gone to Estiatorio Volos on a really bad night. The first sign of trouble was when we arrived and were seated in the bar area because the dining room was supposedly booked up. But, it was less than half full, and was never more than 2/3 full throughout the course of our meal in the bar.

What we later realized is that we were probably seated in the bar because the restaurant was terribly understaffed that night: The bartender was serving all 4 tables in the bar, plus the bar itself. She mentioned something about 3 people not showing up for work that night. This was likely the cause of the disaster that unfolded.

Things went well enough at first: the grilled calamari was tender and the egg lemon soup was unusually tasty. Based on the success of the calamari appetizer, I considered ordering the Seafood Kritharoto, which was supposed to have salmon, shrimp, black cod, calamari, and mussels. I'm usually suspicious of mixed seafood dishes like this, because they often consist of just one little bite of each thing, supplemented by a mound of starch (in this case, saffron orzo). Our waitress/bartender assured me, though, that this dish bucked that trend and came with a pile of seafood.

After quite a wait--our entrees definitely sat in the kitchen for a while before they were delivered to us--the Kritharoto arrived as I feared it would: a small quantity of seafood and a large pile of orzo. Compounding the small quantity was the fact that the variety was lacking: the cod and mussels were missing. There were just two shrimp; three tiny, rubbery calamari tails (none of the tender calamari body that had been served in the appetizer), and a small (3 cm) chunk of salmon.

When the waitress returned, I asked what was up with the missing cod and mussels. She disappeared to check, and the manager or owner returned. He apologized, and said that their fishmonger had not delivered quality cod or mussels, so they substituted extra of the other seafood. (If what I got was extra quantities, I would hate to see the normal.)  He said he would comp the dish, and hurried off before I could protest further. I was not happy, because I should have been told this when I ordered--I would have changed my order. I felt I had probably been delivered a dish of some seafood scraps the kitchen felt lucky to get rid of, which is why they gladly served it to me instead of saying something.

Things continued to go downhill. We had to ask two or three times to have our water refilled and have a salt shaker delivered to the table (for the disappointing cornish hen, which looked more like a regular chicken breast than a portion of a cornish hen).

At this point, the manager/owner could tell we were really not happy and came back to the table. He agreed it was unacceptable that I was not told about the substitution when I ordered, and also agreed that the rubbery calamari tails were lame. He brought another order of the calamari appetizer to compensate, but it seemed to little, too late. The whole experience had been thoroughly unpleasant.

In the end, he thankfully comped all our entrees. The bill was still $100 for three, for a drink (a pretty short martini for $12), a bottle of wine, and appetizers."}
{"text":"Was there for lunch on a Friday - atmosphere professional, friendly, upbeat. Server David was great - very high spirits which is contagious. Shared the Saganaki and the grilled octopus amongst four of us. Both were excellent, flaming presentation of the saganaki is fun - it's clearly a specialty as it was being served over and over throughout the time we were there. We had moussaka, the veal dish and braised lamb - all of which were delicious. Would certainly return again & again!"}
{"text":"Went here for winterlicious with my guy just last week. The ambience was pretty interesting. The restaurant's adorned with various urns, pottery, columns, arches, and some kind of hanging light fixture that look like giant green bulbs. Gives it an era-gone-by fishery kinda feel. 

Service was spot on. Our waiter came to check up on us at least once during each part of our 3 course meal. Couldn't have asked for better. 

For apps, I got the calamari and he had the vegetarian option. Mine was really nicely done. The tenderness was amazing and the little veggies on top complimented it pretty well. What I really liked was the balsamic vinegar paste thing that they decorated the bottom of the plate with. 

We had the salmon and lamb shank for main. Only complaint on my part was that the salmon could use a pinch more salt, but in light of everything else, no biggie. I had a bit of his lamb, and it was literally falling off the bone. 

Dessert was the pressed yogurt and saffron & pistachio ice cream. My ice cream was just delicious. Not too much and not to little, with nice little berries as decorations on top. And the yogurt was really good too. Thick and creamy, definitely not something you could ever find in a store. 

Definitely a place I would come back to. Wished their menu was little bigger, and had like a whole page of seafood to peruse, but otherwise, I hope they never change."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. Perfect for a nice, classy business lunch. Always a positive experience here."}
{"text":"We had an incredible dinner experience here on a Saturday night before the opera at Four Seasons. We booked an early dinner at 5:30pn in order to make it to our 7:30pm opera. We were seated on time upon arrival and were able to get out at 7pm, just in time for the show. We did let our hostess know that we had to catch the show and were offered an option to have their Four Seasons Prix Fixe menu (available to those going to see the show across the street). Their Four Seasons menu proved to be a really good value: we basically paid the equivalent of a main course while also enjoying an appetizer and a scrumptious dessert. The price for the three courses was $36!!!
¬†
FOOD
Appetizers: we had their calamari and dolmades. Both were outstanding.
The calamari was grilled and was served in one giant piece. Grilled to perfection, not chewy, just perfect. Served with capers, olives and some grilled tomatoes.
Doldmades were good too, I believe this is their specialty (I was blown away by that calamari though!). Dolmades is basically flavoured rice rolled in grape leaves. I liked the flavour of pine nuts: it was noticeable yet not overpowering.
Mains: we had salmon and lamb shank. Once again, both courses were a hit. 5 stars!
Salmon was grilled to perfection as well, so moist and flavourful. It was served with a side of delicious spanakorizo with feta and greek herbs, drizzled with lemon. It was very unique and it was such a perfect accompaniment for the fish.
My partner's lamb shank was done perfectly as well, he said it was very flavourful as well and probably the best lamb shank he has ever had!
Dessert: We shared greek yoghurt with honey and chocolate mousse. I was eoed by the chocolate mousse, it totally hit the spot. However, their yoghurt was as good as greek yoghurt can get. I would probably recommend choosing a more traditional dessert option like chocolate mousse.
¬†
WINE
Their wine list is mostly greek wines which I know nothing about. We trusted their sommelier with our wine choices and were not disappointed. I asked for something similar to sauvignon blanc and what he offered totally hit the spot.
¬†
AMBIANCE
This place feels airly and fresh. It instantaneously transports you to Mediterranean with all its greek design elements such as ancient-style vases and statues, as well as sea-inspired d√©cor. I felt it was perfectly suitable for a romantic date as well as business dinner.
¬†
OVERALL EXPERIENCE
Five-star service, five-star food and five-star decor. If I could give this place six stars I totally would!
Bonus: their $36 Four Seasons Prix Fixe menu is a must-try and probably the best deal in town!"}
{"text":"4/5! Highly recommend for winterlicious. Try the prawn saganaki, braised lamb shank and flourless cake."}
{"text":"I liked it. The ambience is very nice and the Martini was well made. Service was slow.

Didn't care much for the Greek wine (by the bottle) but that is not their fault. As part of a group, I dutifully drank what was ordered.

My veal chops were good. 

A little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"I must admit that we stopped into this restaurant because it was close to our hotel and it was decently rated, not because we researched it really.

What a great surprise!

We started with the octopus and the spicy sausage with peppers - both were delicious. My friend had a Greek wine, which I usually don't care for, but this one recommended by our server (who was great!) was delicious. We then had the lamb shank and the moussaka. They were excellent examples of top-notch comfort food! I would go back to this place in a minute if I were back in Toronto. Loved it."}
{"text":"The food here is just amazing. The moussaka is almost as good as my Nanny Yaya's. The seafood is always fresh and cooked to perfection. 

The bar is very well stocked, although I've never ventured past the Athenian Mojito- it's just too good!

Service is always quick and friendly, without being pretentious. 

Always call and make a booking for dinner. Even one person on a Monday night will be seated at the bar without a reservation. 

Props on Volos accepting Diners Club/Discover, a rarity in Canada."}
{"text":"Volos was excellent, with a great date night atmosphere. My husband and I walked in on a Wednesday evening and were seated immediately. I redeemed my Yelp check in for the complimentary saganaki, which was delicious and had a nice hint of licorice from the ouzo. I ordered the fig stuffed Cornish hen, and my husband had the grilled Mediterranean sea bass filet (although he originally ordered the snapped, but they were out). He raved about the freshness of the sea bass, which was served with sides of saut√©ed greens, asparagus, and sliced potatoes. My Cornish hen entree was excellent as well - the fig stuffing had just the right amount of sweetness, and the feta mashed potatoes were a good, tangy complement. We passed on dessert, although we each ordered a glass of wine based on our waiter's suggestion (the Agiorgitiko and the Assyrtiko). I would definitely visit again if I lived closer, but alas, the five hour drive between Toronto and Pittsburgh makes it difficult."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday with my girlfriend for her birthday. Food was great, service was great, and the decor was top notch. Glad to see TO finally get a Greek restaurant in the heart of downtown. 

Unlike most Greek restaurants which look like they've been decorated by The Cartoon Network in an atrocious blue and white 'hut' theme, Volos is a classy looking joint that sets high expectations from the moment you walk in...and it delivers.  The owner came to our table shortly after we sat down and walked us through the wine menu and gave us his suggestions for food. My gf and I wanted to do more of a tapas style, which was easily done even when including a main dish. I was also impressed by our server's knowledge of the menu and the ingredients of each dish. We had the Spetzofai (spice sausage in a delicious tomato and pepper sauce), grilled octopus, saganaki (flaming cheese), Greek salad and the main salmon course. What makes Volos one of the best Greek food experiences out there is the attention to detail: the octopus was grilled to perfection and served in a balsamic vinegar-based sauce that was delicious; the salmon was crisp on the outside but melted like butter in your mouth and was serviced on top of what seemed to be a dill-based risotto. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients and the uniqueness of the chef's recipes. 

As for price, Volos is in-line with top restaurants in Toronto. It's not the cheapest game in town, but it was good value for what we got. We didn't get any drinks besides the wine, so would be curious to know how much cocktails run for. 

This place will become one of Toronto's premier restaurants for sure and if they can keep up the quality then it will stay on the map for a long time."}
{"text":"I grew up in Toronto and I've been fortunate to have eaten at many of the city's best restaurants.   I now live in NYC, (and I have developed a true New Yorkers pallet) so when I dine out I expect a lot...no matter the geographic location. Volos is a sensational restaurant...on par with any top NYC restaurant and in my opinion the best restaurant I have been to in Toronto.  Scallops (melt in your mouth), Spetzofai (signature dish...lamb sausage was incredible), Exohico, Octopus, Hen and Halibut are all amazing.  

Trust me...if you go to Volos the quality of food and ambiance will leave you very impressed. Service was impeccable and I look forward to heading back next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal in a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Waitress was charming and service was excellent. When dessert order was overlooked, it was provided \"on the house.\" Salmon and scallops were excellent."}
{"text":"I first have to disclaim that I am not cultured in Greek food at all. I am reviewing this restaurant as a general restaurant, rather than as a Greek restaurant. I also have no idea how authentic the food is.

I came here on a Saturday night with a group of 7. The place was busy, definitely call ahead and make a reservation. I tried the saganaki for app and moussaka for main. The busboy torched the saganaki in front of our table, making it a pretty neat experience. That was the only cool thing about it though. To me, the saganaki was just a piece of warm cheese soaked in oil. Even the cheese lovers at my table was not too impressed with it. If you want to try it, definitely share one with a few others! We had 4 people sharing one piece, and it was plenty. The moussaka was also not my cup of tea. It resembled a lasagna, but instead of tomatoes, it was eggplants. There was barely any beef in the pie. It felt heavy in my stomach afterwards too. 

Aside from food, the ambiance of the restaurant was nice - your standard upscale restaurant feel. The service was slow. I think we waited close to an hour for our mains to come out. We also had a few different waitresses serving us. They should probably streamline their waiting process. 

Overall, I would not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I only ordered two appetizers so maybe not the most extensive tasting.  Both were very good.  The Moroccan Octopus looked amazing and tasted good too.  Everything on the dish compliments the octopus well, the puree of eggplant, bits of dried figs, bit of arugula salad, one olive and one cherry tomato.  The cherry tomato was really fresh, something so simple but a rarity.  The arugula salad had an olive oil dressing that was done just right.  The goat cheese was really good and not too rich.  It was spread on the side with a vinaigrette drizzled on it which was a good touch.  Nothing was over done here, the ingredients were just the right amount to make the food delicious and keeping it light."}
{"text":"Great Greek food - outside of a food court in the financial district! 

The ambience is great for friends and a business dinner as well and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.

For starters:
1) Saganaki - hot shee's' milk cheese - must have it right away. Once it cools down it toughens.  Its great when its hot!

2) Grilled Calamari - perfectly grilled.

3)Soutzokakia: meatballs in tomato sauce. They were okay - not quite memorable. There was something missing in the flavours - i just can't point my finger on it.

For Main:
Exohico which the waiter described as a Greek burrito. It was the classiest burrito i have had. It was braised lamb, veggies and cheese in a Phyllo Pastry. The  braised lam was perfect with great flavours. I'm not a big fan of the pastry shell around the beef - not really sure if that was necessary. I understand the pastry is probably the substitute for the traditional tortilla wrap on the burrito but it just did not do justice to the braised lamb inside. I could've had the lamb on its own.

For a step up on traditional Greek food we get in the city, i would definitely return here. it'll be a great evening with good food and excellent service."}
{"text":"While the food is good and the wine list has a good number of good Greek wines, i cannot rate the food here as high as others have primarily as i am not a big fan of the sauces they use on the choices i had. I started with the grilled octopus which is one large tentacle, cooked properly but which is served with a somewhat sweet sauce. I really enjoyed the octopus but could have done without the sauce although there was only a small amount present. I then had the exohico while good again in my opinion was weakened by the slightly sweet sauce. The baklava was the biggest disappointment for me as its good taste was more than offset by its dryness. I enjoyed the glass of 2011 assyrtiko santorini boutari wine i had with the octopus as it was very well balanced, crisp and refreshing. The glass of red that i had (2010 xinomavre paranga was less impressive as it lacked structure and any really pronounced flavor but then i am a really serious wine drinker and realize there are normally big sacrifices to be made when ordering by the glass. Overall, a good greek restaurant with good ambiance but food not quite as highly reviewed on yelp."}
{"text":"Volos is definitely a hidden gem that every Torontonian should go to!

Having been here for 2 times, I can only say that they have amazing seafood cuisine and service! It might be hard to see how the restaurant looks like from the outside, but the interior is so beautiful and make sure you order Saganaki!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance and even better food. Highly recommend this place for seafood. Only negative was the saganaki. Wasn't the best, would not order it again."}
{"text":"Came here last night for Winterlicious and was not disappointed. The food was so amazing, that we actually felt bad for paying so little.

We started with the saganaki, and both had the octopus starter, and braised lamb shank. Both were cooked perfectly and were impeccably flavourful - the octupus was tender, and the lamb forked apart and fell off the bone clean. Heavenly.

Our waiter was amazing as well, providing honest wine suggestions (not the typical suggesting the most expensive bottle move) that complemented our food and our palettes. Servers and busboys came around frequently enough to refill water and wine glasses without being intrusive. Ambience is fantastic for a night out.

I may have just found my new favourite restaurant in Toronto, and I'm sad it took me this long. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I enjoyed every bite.

The appetizer Saganyaki (goat cheese on fire) was to die for.
The Scallops quite tasty.
The white wine a nice complement. 

Environment is welcoming, calm and relaxing.

I will be back."}
{"text":"came here for winterlicious. A good-try Greek food"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this spot since it first opened.  It's not everyday you come across a Greek restaurant that doesn't fall into the cheap takeout souvlaki or home-y mid-range resto with tacky decor (at least in Canada).  So Estiatorio VOLOS was a welcome change that promised higher-end service, drinks and wine list, as well as ingredient-focused food.

I finally had an excuse to go when I needed to pick a place for a visitor and friend.  My requirements were that it had to be a nice restaurant, easy to get to via TTC, with many seafood options.  VOLOS fit the bill for us, so that's what I recommended.

It's conveniently located just a couple metres from Osgoode Stn (the COC exit).  I arrived a tad earlier, but was shown to my table right away.  The hostess also served double duty by handling the complimentary coat check, which is always handy on rainy/fall/wintry days.

We arrived on a dark and rainy night for dinner, and the restaurant was dimly lit (but enough for reading) which I enjoyed, and afforded us a clear view out their restaurant which is wrapped around with large windows.  I'm sure it gets lots of natural light on nice days.

Our server was friendly and attentive.  He introduced himself to the table when we were ready, and double-checked our orders with the kitchen when I told him I was lactose-intolerant.

They have Canadian, International, as well as Greek wines. Standard Greek beers (which I would avoid if you trust the RateBeer ratings), Greek spirits (not just ouzo), and a Greek-spin on cocktails rounded out the drink list.

Our table ordered the Avgolemono soup, Horiatiki Salad, and the Grilled Calamari to start.  Entrees were the fisherman's stew, the roast leg of lamb, and the fig-stuffed cornish hen.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes, and portion sizes were very good for the price, which is a welcome change when eating at \"fancier\" places.

The grilled calamari was bigger than I was expecting for an appetizer, with 3 whole calamari pieces (no tentacles), topped with tomatoes, olives, capers, and drizzled with a vinaigrette. The calamari was tender, with delicious grills marks that provided nice chargrilling flavours and aromas.

The roast leg of lamb was flavourful, fall-of-the-bone, and served on a bed of swiss chard (a bit salty for me), roasted vegetables, and topped with crispy leeks.  Definitely took that home for seconds.

My companion finished every last bit of the cornish hen, which was tender and moist, and deliciously stuffed with figs and pecans, served with braised greens and whipped potato with feta.

The fisherman's stew was a delight.  It had an abundance of seafood (pacific salmon, mussels, calamari, and prawns) in a tomato-based broth, and was served with two large slices of baguette to sop up the remaining stew at the end of the fish.

We had no room for dessert, unfortunately, but many of them sounded great.  We all left full and satisfied, and I imagine VOLOS will remain on my list of finer-dining restaurants with good service and value for some time to come."}
{"text":"In from out of town and ate here two nights in a row. Excellent fresh food done perfectly. The grilled calamari is a great starter and the scallop dinner is fabulous."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I had seen, I had pretty high expectations for this place. When I first walked in, I instantly loved the atmosphere. I also liked the service and open concept kitchen. The saganaki as an appetizer was good.  However, our mains is what left me unimpressed with this restaurant.  It's possible we just had some bad luck. :( I got the beef tenderloin cutlets with feta mash and grilled vegetables ($34). The beef was tasty but nothing special, the feta mash was cold and pretty bland (where was the feta?) and the veggies were fine. My friend got the sea bass special which was okay tasting but quite a small piece of fish for $39. He was still hungry after dinner. 

I might give this restaurant another shot but I'll order the moussaka instead."}
{"text":"Wicked resto 
Excellent food 
Reasonable prices and a great server in Chris 
His suggestions and guidance from Greek wine to Greek dishes was excellent

{"text":"This was probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant. 

I had a reservation for my birthday (14th Feb) well in advance, had taken a look at their menu and was really excited for the dinner. They even called me to confirm the day before but not once was I informed (neither by the person who called me, nor via their website) that the menu for Valentine's Day is Prix Fixe. I only found out about 20 mins before the reservation time because my boyfriend had called them to arrange a little surprise for me and they told him they were unable to arrange anything because the menu was fixed. When I called to confirm this, they said it was indeed prix fixe and that it would be $68/person for a 4 course meal. I was absolutely not okay with being blind-sighted like that but since everyone was almost there already, we didn't cancel.

We liked the ambiance of the restaurant and ordered our food. I got the Seafood Chowder, Pan Seared Scallops, Grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass and a Chocolate Cake. The portions were large and definitely filling and the Chowder tasted quite good. The Scallops were nothing special, the cake was way too dense and not much to my liking and I got the Sea Bass to go. On trying the fish at home, it turned out to have scales on it as well as a few bones, the latter didn't bother me a lot. As for the former, there was not just 1 but several scales and I found that quite unappetising.

In terms of just eating food to be full, sure the dinner worked, but otherwise it was absolutely not worth the money.

Extremely disappointed overall."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday last night and had a pretty good experience in general. 

For appetizers, we got the calamari, octopus, and Saganyaki. The Saganyaki was goat cheese lit on fire, which looked cool and tasted pretty damn amazing. The bread here was really soft and yummy btw. For entr√©e,  I ordered the braised lamb which was to die for -  so tender! 

Service here, however, was why I gave it a four star instead of five. Our server seemed very impatient with us, since we were a larger ish party. He was definitely not happy when we requested the bill to be paid separately."}
{"text":"We ordered:

Saganaki,
Sesame crusted feta

Catch of the day,
Braised lamb shank,
white wine from Santorini

Everything was savoury and delicious. 

The crusted feta was very unique in flavour.  Sometimes feta can over power because of its saltiness -- this was perfect and e sesame and cheeses blended well. 

Saganaki was your typical but a little over done in the frypan - hard to mess that up.

The fish was fresh and light.  It was perfectly poached and the meat easily fell off the bone when picked at.  It came with steamed veggies.

I had a bit of her lamb as well.  It was amazingly tender and very delicious.  I regret not ordering this because it was definitely one of the best prepped lamb dishes I've ever tried.

5 stars on the food.

The service was awesome as well.  Very informed and attentive and also  wasn't over-serviced.

It's a little more on the pricy side.  Average of each appetizer is about $13, $28 for main and our wine was about $80.

With gratuity your night can easily cost almost $100 per guest.  Was it worth it?  Every penny of it!"}
{"text":"Went two nights ago on a Tuesday, the restaurant was still pretty full but nothing crazy. If you're like me, that makes a difference in the judging criteria (e.g. Food/service may be different from a Saturday night and definitely different from fixed menu events like winterlicious)

Mostly the focus was really on the great food. Everything else was fine but not excellent (eg service was a bit slow but not ridiculously long)

There were five of us, we ordered the grilled octopus by the servers reco (excellent), and the saganaki (pretty standard but always delicious)

Of our meals, foodies would think that the best were the seafood kleftiko and the braised lamb shank. Those that seek out more typical fare will appreciate the moussaka  (the other two ordered the scallops and the orzo which were ok but definitely nothing special)

For dessert we shared the figs and yogurt and the saffron pistachio ice cream. Both weren't very sweet desserts and the ice cream took some time to get used to as its more earthy tasting and a bit grainy. Not great if you want something decadent but good as top offs"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! If you love seafood, enjoy great wine and have a gluten allergy this place is for you. 

This restaurant is great if you want to have a nice evening out with a special someone, or with a group of friends. It also caters to the theatre crowd if you happen to be going to the Four Seasons, which is located across the street. 

My favourite items on the menu is the Grilled Calamari, Seafood Kritharoto, and Braised Lamb Shank. My partner also swears by the Exohico 
(Phyllo Pastry, Braised Lamb, Vegetables, Feta & Kefalotyri Cheeses with Lamb Jus). For desert I try to always make room for the Flourless Chocolate Cake (gluten-free) and the Mocha Raspberry Coffee. 

I can't wait to go back! 

Bon Appetite :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, service, and food were all on point. I had the salmon and the kritharoto. The flavors were great and well worth the money. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Best meal I had during my 5 day stay in Toronto!!  The fish was cooked to perfection...the staff were very attentive (I was dining alone)...and they even got me a sumptuous cheese plate for dessert from their sister restaurant across the street.  A fine dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Great valentines dinner.

Brings back memories of our trip to Santorini, loved the squid starter.  Extremely tender pork shank, great for meat lovers.  The scallops were of high quality and they were tender and fresh! 

Reasonably priced, not a fine dinning place but fine enough for occasions like valentines.  Waitresses were friendly, reservation worked as expected.  Atmosphere was great!  Also this is an open kitchen restaurant.

Would recommend anyone who would like to try Greek food, of course not chicken souvlaki.

Located in the heart of downtown Toronto, if you're staying nearby hotels or visiting Toronto, give it a try."}
{"text":"A great fusion of traditional and nouvelle Greek food.
Everything is perfectly executed with great finesse and attention to the flavors.
Very nice restaurant with impeccable service.
Truly a treasure in Toronto.
Highly suggested the Greek yogurt and figs for dessert."}
{"text":"Have had a great meal every time I've been here. Working your way through very appetizer is a must do and the wine list is refreshingly different than anything else in the city. I've missed it since moving away, but go back when I can!"}
{"text":"We decided to check out volos because of all the positive reviews. I have to say after eating there I couldn't help but feel that this restaurant is over hyped. The service was pretty excellent, but the food was mediocre. We had the scallops which were a bit on the salty side and halibut which was overcooked. The rest of the meal was fine. One thing that I found pretty ridiculous was that because my party doesn't drink alcohol, the waiter asked would you like water instead? I said yes. At the end of the meal I was charged $12  for WATER. The waiter never mentioned that the water cost 6$ a bottle. I was pretty displeased with that. I probably will not revisit."}
{"text":"love this restaurant! the food was excellent! I think it was the best seafood stew i have ever  tasted.. The room is pretty, and the service was perfect! Katie took great care of us and i look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and fantastic food. Friendly and knowledgeable service. I can highly recommend the octopus and the exohico. There's also a broad selection of delicious Greek wines. Some of the best Greek dishes I've ever had outside of Greece!"}
{"text":"The server mentioned in the review messaged me. His name is Adam G. and he is a fellow Yelper. Thanks Adam!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and sat at the bar, Great friendly service from greeter to manager.
I had the lamb sausage once and then the daily fresh fish. Fantastic food with a nice wine selection.
I can't wait for the next visit"}
{"text":"(4.5 Stars)

My first time dining here and I decided to go during Winterlicious. To my surprise, they also offered their regular menu during this time too, which was nice. My fiance and I decided to stick to the winterlicious menu since it was more bang for your buck. 

We started with the Saganaki which was delicious! We both ordered the Grilled Calamari to start. It was really nice and flavourful with a balsamic dressing lightly drizzled over it. For our entree, I ordered the Cornish hen and my fiance ordered the Salmon. Both entrees were excellent, offering a decent portion for the price. For dessert I ordered the Flourless chocolate cake and my fiance ordered the Saffron and pistachio ice cream. The cake was just OK, nothing special. The ice cream was absolutely delicious though! I wish I ordered that instead. Very unique flavour.

I had a glass of Greek red wine with my meal and my fiance tried a Greek beer. I enjoyed my experience here and would love to return in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.
The lamb shanks fell off the bone and the moussaka was flavorful.
The wine list could use some additional varieties of wines ."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for Volos, which promises high-end nouveau Greek cuisine, with a menu designed by Greek-cuisine maven Diane Kochilas.

Our verdict - meh. Yes, the room is beautiful and the service was excellent. But the food was just OK. In order to try more dishes, we decided to stick to appetizers, and none of the five we ordered hit it out of the park. The sesame-crusted feta was very good, but the octopus was kind of dry, the soutzoukakia (meatballs) had way too much of something (cumin?), the fried zucchini were heavier than they should be, and the horiatiki salad lacked flavour (OK, it's only March, and they're serving greenhouse tomatoes, but still - they're charging for it). 

Dessert was better: house-made baklava with saffron ice cream, and a decadent chocolate mousse. 

But overall, disappointing. So many better options in town, including one or two Greek joints on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I have been remiss in reviewing the many restaurants I have visited over the past several months.  I am making an exception here however.  WHAT A MEAL!  Andreas - you are the best.  The short primer on Greek wine was exceptional and I really enjoyed the wine pairing you recommended with dinner.  Now the food.  The highlight of my meal was the meatballs and the octopus.  I highly recommend these two dishes.

I will be back (Toronto rocks)."}
{"text":"A few of my gal pals and I met for dinner at Volos last night after I heard such rave reviews about the place.  When I arrived, they were able to accomodate my early arrival and were prepping my table.

Service was great; they wanted till all my friends arrived and proceed to get the drinks and appetizer flowing.  We order saganaki aka flaming cheese to share and it was delicious; who does not like their cheese lit on fire!

They had an extensive seafood menu so I have to order something seafood as an entree.  I got the Seafood Kritharoto - a seafood medley in orzo pasta.  It was yummy, a bit under-seasoned but it balanced well with the seafood.

After our entrees, we decided to order the chocolate mousse to share.  It was light and decadent.  I want to try the flourless chocolate cake my next visit.

I loved the atmosphere, it was chic yet casual. I would highly recommend Volos for those looking for a great night out or date night."}
{"text":"I love great Greek restaurants that do food well.  I was lucky enough to get there just in time for Winerlicious 2015 - the menu was perfect and the prices were amazing. M'mmmm Moroccan Octopus. Even in the middle of February we order \"summery\" cocktails at the bar which were delicious.  The staff and atmosphere are lovely  - my husband and I were celebrating our 2nd anniversary and I wanted an intimate but comfortable & urban setting.  

So many great options on the regular menu - I can't wait to go back!  And don't miss dessert.  If you're a fan of chocolate go with the Ouzo Chocolate Mousse...we paired it with the Baklava to create one amazing dessert.  We ended up with a Greek red wine on the recommendation of our waiter based on our entrees -- really good."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant if you are looking for an upscale Greek restaurant for dinner.

Located in the entertainment district, this place is super convenient if you are going to catch a movie, hit up a Richmond street bar, or if you are just wandering on Queen street.   You may want to consider dressing up a bit for dinner here.

I love Saganaki!  It's cheese... doused in Brandy... that is set on fire.
Do it again! Do it again!

The Kefalotyri Cheese Saganaki ($11) was my favourite eatable of the evening.  Salty, fatty, oh-so-cheesy good with fresh bread.

The moussaka ($19) was fantastic and the perfect sized portion.  Layers or veggies, potatoes, eggplant, ground beef, and more cheese!  It was warm, creamy, and heavy with bechamel sauce and hit the spot!

The server recommended wines for our entrees.  We were pleased with the suggestions.

For dessert, we shared the flourless chocolate cake with mint and orange compote ($9).  The cake was chocolately and moist.  I'm not a huge fan of orange and mint together.  The dessert reminded me of those smashable chocolate-oranges that get given away at Christmas..but with mint and less smashing.  Not bad, but I would try another dessert next time.

I hope that the concierge at the Sheraton is sending guests over here!  
I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday with his parents. It's a beautiful space, the service was top-notch and the food was amazing. We had saganaki and grilled octopus for starters, and veal tenderloin, lamb shank and halibut for mains (one of their specials for the night). Everything was perfect and as requested when I made the reservation, they brought out a slice of cake with a candle in it for my husband at the end. Highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I particularly loved the appetizers here. They did a really good job with the grilled calamari and the soup (avgolemono). Also - the olive oil that comes with the bread is among the best I have had. Don't miss out on trying the olive oil with their bread!

Bonus tip: A check in on Yelp gets you a free saganaki appetizer"}
{"text":"Good service, delicious saganaki.  Although waitstaff forgot to punch in the appetizer for free, after checking in on Yelp, it was so tasty I would've been willing to just order it on regular anyway.  Seafood seems fresh, and I have yet to come across a bad piece of shellfish (they must be checking them before serving - whew!).  Only down side is that the seafood dishes all seem to taste pretty much the same:  whether you choose salmon, swordfish, or some other fish of the day, they all seem to come out in the same tomato broth / soupy bowl as the Fisherman's Stew.  Good thing that Fisherman's Stew is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"GOOD LOOKING EVERYTHING! From the venue, to the decor, to the food, and... the servers. 

I'm glad I joined the group of Yelpers to attend Volos as part of Yelp Eats! event. This place ranks pretty high in my books in terms of having the best food and service in town. 

THE VENUE:
I loved the look of the place.  Interestingly, they somehow managed to make the place feel open, yet intimate at the same time.  Also, the washrooms were nice, too. (I have a weird thing about washrooms - if I don't like the washroom, I find that it kind of ruins the overall experience.)  So I liked the look and feel of the place altogether - including the washrooms.

FOOD: 
All the food was amazing in taste and presentation.

For starters, I had the Octopus. It was perfectly cooked and very tasty. Usually Octopus is a little stringy, but this one wasn't in the least bit stringy or tough, rather it was perfectly tender. I also tried a couple pieces of the Zucchini Tower. As someone else has already said, it's basically like zucchini tempura. It's a huge dish an great for sharing! The zucchini is lightly breaded so that you can still taste the natural goodness of the zucchini. 

I ordered the Exohico as suggested by many. It was really tasty and I was really happy with the perfect balance of all the flavours! Usually the lamb flavour overpowers the entire dish, but not this one. I liked that there were just enough veggies inside and the phyllo pastry is simply deliciously crispy! Definitely worth trying. 

My husband wanted to order the rabbit, but unfortunately it is no longer offered. However, when I asked our server why they no longer serve it, he explained that they can't make the dish consistently because they have to prepare it differently if it's male or female. And I believe it when he said that they only want to prepare food that they can make consistently good. So my husband ordered the Black Angus New York Strip Loin (he was in the mood for meat). The strip loin was cooked to perfection! I would say it's comparable to The Keg (but without the excess butter). Thank goodness he was willing to share! Each piece was so savoury and obviously delicious. 

By the time dessert came around, I was too full to try anything. I think next time I may have to make sure I save some room for dessert! 

SERVICE: 
To sum it up in one word: IMPECCABLE!
As Melanie C. already said, the staff was attentive and friendly without being intrusive or annoying.  I also felt that they were personable; as in, I felt like I was talking to a friend when I spoke with them - you really feel like they care. And I have to say that they're easy on the eyes as well.  Thank you Phil for delivering such amazing service to each and every one of us.

Also, closer to the end of the night, it was great to have Andreas sit down with us and talk about his restaurant.  He seems very passionate about this restaurant and I think that he's done a really great job with the restaurant.  I also appreciated the fact that he wanted to make sure that all the food went out to the other tables before he joined our party.

AND to top it off, after we had left, one of the staff noticed that someone had left their packed up leftovers on the table so he ran out to bring it to us.  Great service indeed!

OVERALL:
I would definitely go back.  I don't think it gets any better than great food and even better service. You can't beat that!

So what are you waiting for?  Get going already to Volos Estiatorio!!!"}
{"text":"Walking up to the restaurant, I already knew I would love the ambience of it. The decor and set up of the place is amazing, I especially enjoyed the fact you could see the chefs at work from our table. 

Came here with friends for Summerlicious 2015 and tried everything on the menu save for the grilled octopus appetizer. 

APPETIZERS

Arugula & Fennel Salad: It's a very light and very .. green (for a lack of a better word) salad. If you like arugula, cottage cheese, and your salads with no dressing whatsoever, then this would be perfect for you. 

Grilled Calamari: I am a big fan of calamari. This was probably the dish I was most looking forward to trying. The calamari was a bit undercooked for my taste (AKA chewy/squishy) but overall still enjoyable. This filled me up quite a bit and I didn't even finish the whole plate. 

ENTREES

Grilled Wild Pacific Salmon: The salmon was SO tender, I was jealous I didn't order it myself. I personally enjoyed the dill rice that came with it. However, the greens that came with it were too bitter for our taste. 

Roasted Lemon Chicken: As my friend said, chicken is either perfectly juicy or too dry, and unfortunately the chicken in this dish fell in the latter group. The couscous was also undercooked, there were hard bits in there but the flavouring was spot on. 

Braised Lamb Shank: I absolutely loved the crispy leeks, that was the highlight of the dish. 25% of the shank was fat/skin which was kind of disappointing but cool at the same time. The mashed potatoes were alright, I'm not sure if it was the lamb shank sauce or the feta in the potatoes that made it sour tasting though. 

DESSERTS

Traditional Baklava: Very sweet, flaky at the top, and well, very sweet. 

Ouzo Chocolate Mousse: This was a delight. Heavy as expected for mousse and perfectly bittersweet. 

Honey Yogurt Cheesecake: I prefer my cheesecakes cheesier than this but it wasn't all that bad. 

Service was great. The restaurant actually called me a few hours before our reservation regarding a special request I had when I booked online. We were celebrating my friends birthday so either she could have chosen a dessert from their menu and get it for free OR they could do a surprise dessert and surprise her at the table. We opted for the latter and got a chocolate brownie. However, we waited FOREVER before we could flag down a waiter to get our bill. 

Overall, I don't think the food was worth the $35 price tag per person. Most likely won't be returning to VOLOS anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"This place has the best lamb shank, sea bass and grilled octopus!!  Was here for dinner with my family - and the food was delicious!  If you check in via yelp, you get the cheese appetizer for free!  All the dishes reminded me of when I was in Greece - very authentic and tasty!  The portions were decent, wine selection was broad, and ambiance was very fancy yet comfortable.  Service was quick and efficient too!  Price is on the higher end - but that was expected given the location and setting.  Would definitely come back for another special night out!"}
{"text":"Amazing service.  Delicious food.  Great cocktails and wine.  Fantastic company.  Nice ambience.

I was ecstatic to learn that Volos was participating in the Yelp Eats promotion.  It was a great excuse to treat myself to a nice dinner and donate to charity at the same time.  The staff at Volos are very attentive and friendly.  Nothing was overlooked.  Our server, Phil, individually addressed each one of us and checked up on us at just the right times (but not too much).

They have an extensive Greek wine list, as well as some creative cocktails.  I enjoyed my randomly ordered glass of wine, but noticed Phil was very helpful with helping some sommeliers at our table choose a wine to match their meal.  There were also many cocktails that looked appealing.  I would love try the Med next time - skinos, lime juice and soda.

The menu is an interesting modern twist on Greek food.  Lots of seafood options.  We were informed that Volos tries to source locally to ensure the freshest ingredients.  They are so particular on consistency and quality that they only introduce items on their menu once they've perfected it.

I was lucky to be part of a large party and we shared several appetizers.  My favourites were the zucchini tower (served with tzatziki!) and the grilled octopus.  The saganaki is always fun (flames and all) and delicious too.  The sesame crusted feta was an interesting choice.  It was good, but I loved the zucchini.  We also enjoyed complimentary olive bread.

When I found out their fish was as fresh as could be, I ordered one of the specials of the day - the red snapper.  They serve you a whole fish and you have a choice of bone-in, deboned, or filleted before cooking.  Phil explained that the bone-in option kept the most juices and flavours in the fish, so I had to choose it.  I thought it might be tricky to eat, but once you track down the main bone, you can easily work around it.  It was definitely juicy and full of flavour.  I was pleased that it wasn't too greasy or overcooked either.  For those who don't eat fish regularly, prepare yourselves: the whole fish comes with head and tail!

My market price fish rang in at just over $30 for a huge portion.  There are also several menu options that are very affordable, such as the moussaka ($19).  I tried the eggplant dish on my last visit.  Definitely the best moussaka I've ever had.

Sadly, I didn't have room for dessert.  I tried a spoonful of the saffron ice cream.  It was refreshing and strong in flavour.  I don't think I could eat an entire serving, but I enjoyed the unique taste.  I would love to try the baklava.  (TOP SECRET: I heard rumours that they might introduce a baklava ice cream sandwich!!!)

Thanks to Andreas, the owner, who took the time to tell us a bit about the restaurant and their preparation methods.  Volos definitely strives for excellence in all areas of the dining experience.  This would be the perfect place to take someone to impress them!  I'll be back soon to try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"Went to Volos for a birthday dinner earlier this month and was unfortunately not impressed. We had the flaming cheese (Saganki), which was not as impressive as lead on to be and a very small portion which I found interested as I am not sure why this dish would be ordered not to share. I had the seared cape cod scallops with brown lentils, quinoas, and apple cider reduction - for $29 it was not worth it, there was nothing special about this dish and could be made at home for a fraction of that price easily. Overall I was expecting more from VOLOS, there was nothing special about this night or the food unfortunately."}
{"text":"I've forgotten that I've even came here.  
I was clearing my desk and found a ridiculous receipt says that I ordered one very, very, very expensive drink. 
Then it all came rushing back to me....the plain d√©cor, the minimal exchange between me and the bartender...oh yeah, Estiatorio VOLOS!

I don't know what the name means and I can't be bothered to look it up. 
I was never into Greek atmospheric interior design..if that's what it's called.
I won't say that it's bad. It's actually pretty good.  
The bar faced North, into the streets.  I much rather preferred if the bar faced into the restaurant, allowing for more privacy from non-patrons.  

Sometimes I come to a restaurant just to drink, and why not?  Restaurants offer the best atmosphere for drinking.  So I ordered a ridiculously priced drink that I still don't recognize despite having the receipt. 
I do remember my experience quite well, as my memory is emotion based (as I recently discovered). 

The service was forced, I didn't have a moment of genuine conversation with my waitress. But I had little to talk about anyway. I was there to drink.
I am a man of little words when in the company of good wine.  At least in this case, very expensive wine. I guess the wine failed to resonate with me, as I remember things emotionally, and even wine is capable of imprinting into memory. 

I did not order any food.  I am open to Greek cusine, but more on a Philistine level where the street food is much more enjoyable for me than the fancy stuff. 

I would come back, or I would need someone whom I was to engage in intense and deep conversation.  the venue feels appropriate. Maybe it's romantic even?
Maybe I just want to flaunt my cash.

I forgot about the place for God sakes!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! 
I would recommend to try the soup as it so tasty! 
I tried calamari, vine leaves, fish and pastry filled with lamb meat as well. They all amazing !"}
{"text":"Avegolemeno soup-thin broth, no lemon taste. One small piece of chicken.

Spinakorizo-rice was undercooked,(crunchy) heavy on dill, creamy texture."}
{"text":"So I finally made it to Volos after hearing so many great things about it (mostly from the Yelp Charity Week in September with one of the events being held here). Moreover, I have just come back from a very special place in Greece (any one heard of Mount Athos were no women are allowed...not even female animals?) and I knew I had to find a place that captured that essence of fresh and warm Greek food.

Intro. Reservations were for 7:30pm and I was originally brought to a table of people that were clearly not my friends. Apologetic faces were aplenty and the manager even came to help straighten things out. I was told that the table was not yet ready and was invited to have a seat by the bar and to enjoy some drinks. I had a glass of the Cuvee Prestige (white) $12/glass and it was recommended by the hostess as a very popular glass with citrus notes. I really enjoyed it. FYI. The hostess also mentioned that I could taste sampler's of different wines before committing which I thought was excellent.
 
Our table was ready and was originally for four, but we actually had 5 guests. I have to say that the restaurant was very accommodating and gave us a round table for 5 which the waitress had originally said was one of the most popular and booked tables/place. Very gracious.

Food. To my utter disappointment, the Mousaka was all sold out. That only attested to the popularity of the dish and I vowed I would return to have it. My second choice was the Cornish Hen which surprisingly was very tender and juicy. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and in no time, I had devoured the whole hen. I am not usually a white meat gal, but even that was so delish. For appetizers, I had the Dolmades (4 pieces) and it came with the most heavenly yoghurt sauce (Taziki) ever: thick, tasty, and cold as Greek Yoghurt should be. 

Other dishes worth mentioning are the Exohico (lamb in Phyllo Pastry) which both my friends raved and ate in a flash and Saganaki as an app (the signature flamed cheese). For dessert, my boyfriend and I shared the very typical dessert Baklava which will satisfy any sweet tooth.

Service. Gracious. And very accommodating. Everyone was so nice and nothing was ever a problem. The owner of the restaurant (I believe Andreas) who looks like a real-life version of Fairy Godmother's son Prince Charming from Shrek...but minus the gold-Pantene-Pro-V-commericial-hairtoss-in-slow-mo-locks periodically would check up on our table. At the end of the evening, he asked how we heard of the restaurant and was very obliging in listing out all the events that could take place in Volos. 

Our waitress handled our request for 5 individual bills with no smirk, eye-roll or sigh so don't be afraid to ask. At the end, she even told our table that she had to do 16 individual bills for a party beside us so clearly not an issue.

Conclusion. I think this restaurant is an absolute gem: food, service, and ambiance (earthy, rustic tones). There is absolutely no pretentious-ness here which makes the shining star, Greek Food, come out."}
{"text":"Wow! - What great ambiance, great service, and great food.  The decor in this restaurant is elegant and welcoming but not overbearing.  It is easy to feel comfortable.  There is a real team spirit among all of the staff from the hostess, bartenders, and waitstaff.  

I sat in the bar for dinner since I was dining alone.  The bartenders were both engaging and knowledgeable.  Knowledgeable not only about wine and drink offerings - but also about the menu and with recommendations about menu items.  

While sitting at the bar - some others from the conference I was attending sat next to me.  We all moved to a table in the bar - and the bar staff was helpful in moving us quickly in spite of the very busy setting.  

For dinner I had the Seafood Kritharoto - a dish with salmon, halibut, tiger prawns, calamari, mussels, clams, and kefalotyri (sheep) cheese, on saffron orzo.  This dish was exquisite - just great and I paired my meal with with a spirited Greek version of a sauvingon blanc. 

For dessert I had the ouzo chocolate mousse - again - just fabulous. I think that there was enough ouzo that I was feeling it - so you may want to check with your server about this.  

I was going to give a four star rating - but reading my review, I think I have to go with five stars.  

In sum - a great place to eat if you are in Toronto and walkable distance from many downtown hotels including the Sheraton Centre, Hilton, and Fairmont Royal York."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the staff are always so friendly! Especially the manager Ellen. What a warm smile that lady has. I recommend the whole fish and the octopus. Even if you are weary of the tentacled dish, go for it. It is done properly so it is tender every time."}

{"text":"My wife and I went there for the new years eve dinner. We ordered grilled octopus for appetizers. It was tender, with delicious flavors and the walnut/eggplant dip was great (5 out of 5). We ordered the lamb shank and seafood main dish. The lamb shank was good, but not as tender and juicy as I expect in a higher end Greek restaurant (3.5/5). My wife's dish was rich in flavors, with generous amount of seafood (4/5). Overall I would give 3.5, but that's not an option here, and it didn't meet my expectations for 4/5. Perhaps next time we will stick to appetizers... They all looked quite good;"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner. Great and efficient service, and friendly staff. The exohico was quite splendid, just the right size, and... well... delicious. The seared halibut was brilliant as well (or so my spouse testifies). Overall, ambiance, noise level, and cleanliness were stellar. No complaints - high recommendations."}
{"text":"Definitely make a reservation. Packed house on a Saturday evening

Baby Arugula & Shaved Fennel Salad - Loved the pear and walnut combination
Saganaki - salty, but loved how they lit up the frying pan right in front of you
Sea bass - we all agreed this was the best dish
Braised Lamb Shank - not as flavorful

Ouzo Chocolate Mousse - couldn't stop nibbling on this
Saffron & Pistachio Ice Cream - not a fan of the saffron, a bit on the sour side

Great service!"}
{"text":"Their Seafood Kritharoto is very nice, I get it every time and it never disappoints. They were out of the Spetzofai though, which was suprising since it was only 6 pm."}
{"text":"Went there for winterliciois and had a great time! The food was fantastic and the staff were great! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Tried Estiatorio Volos for lunch during winterlicious, and they hit all of the right notes. Delicious food, attentive service AND the perfect quick-but-not-rushed turn around, so appreciated by those of us who have to dine and run back to the office (why is this so hard to find?)"}
{"text":"I have to say that I had one of the best Lamb in 2016. The braised lamb shank was literally melting in my mouth. The Spanakorizo was outstanding. Excellent service, relaxing and roomy place."}
{"text":"Now, I love Greek food so I consider myself somewhat of an expert when it comes to Greek cuisine. Estiatorio VOLOS did not disappoint! Authentic Greek food in an atmosphere that brings you to the middle of Athens. Estiatorio VOLOS is located at York and Richmond, near the Hilton and Sheraton hotels. Estiatorio VOLOS is a great spot for those traveling for business and this place is a sure hit for out-of-towners as well as locals.

Reservations are recommended for dinner and may be for lunch, as well. I have heard that the place gets quite busy after shows and during peak periods. However, we were seated right away when we checked in with the hostess. The restaurant seemed to be well-staffed and we did not feel rushed or unattended at all during our visit.

The sesame-crusted feta was awesome and our grilled halibut flaked onto the plate when touched by the fork. Other individuals in our party tried some more adventurous appetizers and entrees, such as the soutzoukakia and the horiatiki salad, accompanied by the Moussaka. They were pleased with their meal.

We enjoyed a nice bottle of white wine, though my partner placed the order, so I am not sure what kind it was. But it was the perfect complement to our meal. I am admittedly not a wine connoisseur, but that night, the wine was extremely good and really added a special something to the meal.

For dessert, we enjoyed baklava all the way around. The baklava was so flaky and delicious, probably the absolute best I have ever had.

The atmosphere is a bit upscale so dress accordingly. No coat is required, but you will want to be dressed appropriately. No sneakers or sports attire. Though not as formal as many upscale restaurants, all patrons were presentable, most in business attire.

The waitstaff was attentive and made sure that we never had to wait for water refills or extras that we requested. The evening we visited the restaurant, they were not extremely busy. I have read other reviews that the service may suffer on busy nights, but we sure did not experience any of that. Services was great and our waiter was pleasant and engaging.

Great atmosphere and wonderful Greek food make this place a hit with us. We will definitely return to try a few of the more exotic Greek treats. For something other than standard Shish Kabobs or souvlaki, try some of the more elaborate dishes. 

I'd give this 4 and a half stars if that was possible. On another note, why does Yelp not have HALF stars???"}
{"text":"Not amazing I am Greek got a bunch of plates it was ok, don't care to return. Prefer places on the danforth"}
{"text":"Had dinner with a party of ten at Volos this past week.  Everything from wine to dessert was wonderful, fun, delicious.  

Our server saved us the effort of choosing appetizers, suggesting that he bring us some platters.  We had a huge salad, a couple of plates of calamari and octopus, lamb meat balls.  I don't eat meat but the rest of the party reported as loving the lamb.  For my part, the calamari was top drawer, the octopus a close second.  

We had a variety of entrees.  I had my favourite, a whole grilled fish, my wife had a serving of the biggest scallops I may ever have seen.  Again, everyone reported having great dishes.  

the ambiance was just boisterous enough to be fun, yet still very confortable, and never so loud that we couldn't have great conversations.  We were so comfortable that our dinner for 10 took is more than 2-1/2 hours all told.

A wonderful dinner celebrating a big event, the restaurant provided two trays of delicious dessert samples as a gift.

I really liked this restaurant.  As well as good food, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I am not even home yet and I am already writing my review. If I could give this place 6 stars I would. Amazing service/food from beginning to end.

{"text":"The service is of a high calibre, unfortunately the food options amongst the non-seafood dishes is average. Admittedly, I didn't try the seafood options and I have heard they are good."}
{"text":"We went there as a family of five and we all loved it. It's rather on the pricey side but it's justified. If you are looking for excellent Greek food, you are at the right spot. 
Nice ambiance and very nice and attentive service. They don't try to sell you the most expensive thing on the menu but the one they like. 
This is another beautiful gourmet discovery in Toronto. The chocolate mousse is out of this world."}
{"text":"Just went for their winterlicious menu here and it was delicious! The decor is very beautiful and would be a nice date restaurant. Both my friend and I ordered the calamari appetizer and it was perfectly cooked. For our mains, I got the lamb shank while my friend got the salmon.  For dessert we both got the flourless chocolate cake. Everything was perfect. 

Service was a little lacking.  Waiter put the bill on the table while we were still eating dessert and we had been there under an hour. But other than that it was a great experience for $35 per person. Will definitely be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"The Saganaki (free from check-in offer) was amazing. It was a big piece so good to share between 2-3 people. And they didn't scrimp on the brandy!

The Grilled Calamari was unremarkable. I'm a big fan of calamari so this didn't impress me. Small portions and the squid flavour just wasn't there - not sure if it's the sauce/herbs or the squid itself.

I had the Braised Lamb Shank - Feta Mash, Swiss Chard, Crispy Leeks.
One of the best lamb shank I've had. Fall of the bone tender. The feta mash was very good.


Service was a mix of good and bad. It started off really well. We made reservations and was seated right away, and were offered menu and the server was very helpful with the menu.
During the appetizers, there was one piece of squid left and the server tried to take the plate away instead of asking if we're done with the dish. I find this a no-no since it feels like we're being rushed.
After finishing our mains, the server asked if we wanted dessert which we opted out of.
What we found weird was she didn't appear anymore until 30 minutes after (in which case, we  were waiting impatiently already so we can pay the bill and get back to work)"}
{"text":"A July trip to Toronto with friends was kicked off by our visit here.  

Things you should eat while here:  Flaming cheese, need I say more? We had a crisp and fresh salad and cucumber soup to start. The main courses where all delicious- one from the specials- a fish dish was a big hit. The roast chicken was juicy with crispy skin. Good wine list. 

The pace of the courses was good. Even when our server darted over to another table to sing opera to a guest.  It seemed there where a lot of regulars there as well, which is always a good sign. Would go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Decorated and presented in an upscale style, I looked forward to a tasty Greek meal with a group of friends. The location was one of few that stood out to the one of us picking restaurants, and allowed us to make a reservation at the advertised Summerlicious price. (A number of places we called would not take a party of 12 without a special group menu.) The decor did not disappoint and at first all was well. Our server was friendly and patient, and we were comfortably seated. Even Monday night, there was a fairly full round of tables right at 7:30pm dinner time - a promising sign.

I hate to say it but I felt their location near the hotels made them accustomed to one-time visiting tourists that didn't care for much and had no expectations, making it easy for them to be trapped into a sub-par quality-for-money kind of meal. Perhaps my table also got profiled quickly as a group of young adults that probably couldn't otherwise afford to be there, so our simple menu choices and lack of drink orders convinced the waiter we weren't worth the effort. Things started out great but as the night went on the meal just didn't stand up to the upscale restaurant experience I expected.

The Summerlicious menu made decision-making much simpler which was very ideal for my group. I went with the octopus appetizer, lobster kritharoto pasta main, and chocolate mousse dessert. I would have ordered a cocktail or glass of wine to go with my drink, however there was no drinks menu readily available.

The appetizers came out after a short wait and we were all delighted to dig in. The octopus was tender and juicy, and the accompanying olives and greens added texture and dimension to the flavours. The portion was just right to stave off the initial hunger due to the late dinner for me.

Things only went downhill from here, as mains came out a full hour after the appetizers. We watched through the window as the restaurant across the street filled up and emptied, and all the tables around us went through all their three courses and paid their bills. There was no particular reason to keep us waiting save for the fact we were a large party, but keeping us for so long was unacceptable. During the hour wait there was minimal service as our waiter went off to attend to many different tables and sometimes just disappeared somewhere completely. It would've been an opportunity to refill some glasses or put in an extra drink order, but none of that took place as we were left to entertaining ourselves completely. 

When the food finally came we were all overly hungry and not very interested in taste anymore. My lobster kritharoto pasta was a rice-shaped pasta tossed in lobster sauce with shrimp. Mostly it tasted like shrimp on pasta with lobster bisque as sauce. The more popular Summerlicious option was the lamb shank, which looked quite appealing, it was very tender and many were very happy with it - unfortunately I do not enjoy lamb. The portions for mains was just right - no leftovers, but still sufficiently filling. If only it had come sooner I wouldn't have felt as unsatisfied. 

Finally it was dessert time - by now we'd mostly lost our patience and we're looking anxiously at the time. Desserts came out after another fifteen minute wait after mains were cleared away. The chocolate mousse looked like two scoops of ice cream that were halfway to melting into a puddle, and the presentation of two brown melty orbs in a white curvy oval bowl reminded me of something very opposite of food...the dollop of whip sitting in the middle didn't erase that imagery. The flavour profile was flat - it was all one commercialized chocolate flavour throughout as if a box of Baker's semi-sweet chocolate was casually blended into the mixture of cream before it was scooped and served. The other popular choice for dessert was baklava - pastry with syrup and nuts. I could see the composition of the three main ingredients but I was uncertain about the proportion of them. There was a lot of puff pastry sitting on top, and the syrup and nut base was a smaller bottom half of the piece. There seemed to be a lack of syrup on top to put the pastry and nuts together, and it tasted the way it looked too from the sample I got from my friend. I don't know my baklava well, but the particular piece I got at Volos did not make me crave more at all.

Overall my impression of Volos was poor - for the $48 (highest price point on the Summerlicious menus) I paid I did not feel like I was getting the expected quality of food or restaurant experience. Nothing about the menu presented Volos as an option worth revisiting in the future to see what the chef has in store, and that negative impression was only aggravated by the slow, inattentive service. The atmosphere suggested to me I would not have to flag for service but I was proven wrong."}
{"text":"I'm surprised how much I enjoyed the food at Volos considering that I'm not a big fan of Mediterranean food. I was reluctant to come here when one of my coworkers suggested it for team lunch, but the food was so good that I want to come back again! I usually stay away from Mediterranean food because I don't like the sauces they use. (I also can't stand goat cheese and greek yogurt) I had the warm seafood salad and the grilled calamari and they were both amazing! It still doesn't change my overall view of Mediterranean or Greek food but I'll definitely come back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"The restaurant is tastefully decorated, and I was quite happy to try a more modern and sophisticated Greek dining experience.   Some great finds on the wine list as well, including a copious selection of fairly priced Greek wines.  And we selected a delicious Assyrtiko.   And I was happy not to breathe garlic over everyone afterwards (often the consequence of meals in many Greek restaurants in Toronto).

But the compliments stop there.  

First of all, it is overpriced for what it is.  There is simply no reason to charge $17.00 for a meagre portion of octopus that was not even perfectly grilled. The balsamic vinegar (obviously they are using the cheap supermarket stuff) leaves an unpleasantly sweet aftertaste.  I also find it hard to believe that the dolmades received any attention at all; they were filled with an unpleasantly sweet and gooey porridge that was supposedly made from Arborio rice.  And only four for the price charged?  3 dollars each for that? I don't mind paying for good food, but I make better ones at home.  The spetzofai (spicy lamb sausage) was tasty but one only gets a few rings drowning in lots of sauce, buried under barely saut√©ed peppers.  The only copious appetizer was the fried zucchini, but one can eat only so much of it.  

The mains were lackluster to downright bad.  The \"special fish\" was a mediocre (and woefully overcooked and mealy-tasting) branzino.  The braised lamb pie was ok but plated like a giant spring roll.  Distressing, though, was the \"riganato beef tenderloin cutlets\".  Awful.  Looked like an executive-class meal on an airline.  Tough, stringy beef that managed to be overcooked and yet have no grilled or saut√©ed taste, and pedestrian vegetable accompaniments.

We shared the figs and yogurt (ok) and the pistachio ice cream.  I agree with one of the reviews on here that the ice cream took some time to get used to (I make saffron and pistachio ice cream at home).  This one was indeed grainy, with an unpleasant aftertaste, and had no discernible pistachio flavour, nor the lovely warm kiss of saffron.  

I wish to point out that on several occasions here a most unpleasant odour wafts over from the kitchen (I presume).  I'm fine with most food smells, but this one was gross.  Perhaps the ventilation system needs to be addressed.

Also, a very long lag in service between the appetizer and the main course, and another lag (even longer) between the main course and dessert.  And yet another lag between the dessert and the coffee.  I'm all for the slow food movement and dislike feeling rushed in a restaurant, but this was simply too much.

We will not return."}

Service: 4/5

This review is for the Winterlicious 2017 menu. We called in a few days in advanced for a table of 4 for dinner and they informed us that the only table left was a table for 12 in which we would get a section of. This was fine with us, I appreciated the heads up and the table ended up being nicely separated. When we arrived,  we were impressed at how nicely decorated it was as we had no idea what to expect from an upscale Greek restaurant.

I ordered the Tiger Prawn Saganaki,  the Lamb Shank and the Baklava. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the menu was $35 instead of the $38 that was stated on the Winterlicious site. 

We were kicking ourselves the next day when a friend informed us that we could have gotten a free Saganaki if we checked in on Yelp. Oh well. Everything we ordered was good and came out quickly, but it didn't overly impress us. The lamb was really tender and a decent size. I got to try a bit of the hen which was something new, and although the taste was decent,  I felt it was a little dry. After my meal,  I was surprised that I didn't feel full after. 

Overall, we thought the food was average, though I can't speak for the menu off winterlicious."}
{"text":"Amazing from appies, main, dessert n the wine. Great location n ambience. Superb service and clean  pretty washrooms."}
{"text":"This was such a great experience! We went here on Saturday night for out first date night since having our son. The atmosphere is extremely cozy and pleasant and I loved the decor, very unique. We ordered a bottle of a delicious Greek wine and started off with a salad and the delicious flaming cheese (sorry I don't remember the Greek terms to what we ordered :)) I had the scallops as my main and they were delicious, cooked to perfection and a wonderful healthy choice for a health nut like myself. My husband had a lamb and spinach stuffed pastry (again sorry don't remember the actual name) and it was unbelievable, so good!!!
For dessert we shared the chocolate mousse, it was amazing and a very generous portion. Overall, the level of service, food and experience are on par with fine dining while I wouldn't say that the prices are too outrageous. 
It was a great experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Octopus tasted frozen.  Chewy.  \"Tiger Prawns\" were definitely not tiger prawns, but jumbo shrimp.  Entrees just meh.  Overpriced
  Would never go back."}
{"text":"Grilled octopus, whole red snapper. Friendly front staff Meg was very very courteous as was waiter David. Greek wine. Chocolate mousse. I waited a bit for my freshly brewed coffee."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this a 4 because I didn't try a ton of dishes here. I'll be back and will update this review. But for now I can only comment on 1 entree and some apps. 

My husband and I were here early on a Saturday. (6:15) it was only half full. The ambience is lovely. Lots of open space and interesting decorative elements. A bunch of empty picture frames on one wall, green glass balls hanging in intricate netting from the ceiling. The service was excellent. My server was not only friendly and polite but extremely enthusiastic about the food. I think his name was Jacob. 

We had:

Dolmades- 5/5 yes! Well seasoned with raisins and pine nuts. So much better than the typical rice stuffed leaves at most places. The tzaziki 
Sauce was incredible! 

Lamb sausages - 3/5 these are made in house. They were tasty but I would have liked a bit of a bolder flavour. My husband loved them. 

Greek salad - 5/5 this had a different name on the menu but it's the 4th salad option. Wow. Fresh tomatoes, delicious feta, and the best olives I've ever had. Seriously, these olives were like grapes! 

Cornish hen - 4/5 very nice blend of flavours. 

Desert : baklava 3/5 I liked that there was cinnamon to offset how sweet it was. The phyllo pastry was a bit soggy.

I can't wait to come back and try the fish and braised lamb. Also the octopus looked incredible! 

I recommend this restaurant if you're a lover of Greek and Mediterranean flavours."}
{"text":"pretty decent food right next to our office. Went here for dinner and took advantage of the free appetizer in checking in on Yelp."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service and the ambience / decor of the place is pretty nice (on the upscale side). We had an all seafood meal, grilled octopus appetizer was delicious as was the main dish; grilled fish of the day. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and really nice staff.  I was in town on a work trip and sat by myself at the bar.  The bartender was extremely attentive and the food was good. I had the scallops which were delicious and a glass of rose.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite downtown spots for a great lunch. The food is fresh, delicious and healthy for the most part. I think I've only ordered seafood here but that's a large chunk of their menu. The atmosphere is upper scale without being pretentious or snotty."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The servers are very experienced and give their all to service. It's a great place for career servers to shine. Just beautiful work and management is spectacular. Just a great place for people to spend the rest of their lives. SAGANAKI for all!"}
{"text":"Estiatorio VOLOS is an excellent restaurant. Superb food, service, and atmosphere - in all respects I am always very pleased with my experiences here. Dining companions always say the same thing too: great meal, great service etc. I think for Toronto one always tends to think Greek town/Danforth as the best place to get Greek food, but if you haven't been here, check it out. Even though it is downtown, it is perhaps a bit \"hidden away\" if you don't happen to be in this area (Richmond/York) regularly. Reservations recommended, often busy and booked."}
{"text":"I was looking for a decent spot in the area for a double date and it was a good option in a pinch as Byblos, Buca etc., were booked up.

Our table was an appetizing feast of dishes like grilled Morocan octopus, calamari, saganaki, fisherman's stew, and seafood kritharoto. I'm a big fan of the orzo seafood dish, but found it a bit rich/heavy this time. 

As an exciting aside, did you know that there is a free saganaki if you check-in on Yelp???

I've been to VOLOS a handful of times in the past, but somehow only discovered the saganaki bonus on my last visit. It is obviously delicious, sharable and priced on the menu at $13. Cheese score!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has nice decor and quiet relaxed atmosphere. The service was excellent. The food was not anything I would come back for. I tried traditional greek dish moussaka and it was not bad but nothing special, if the dish price was about $15 bucks it would be worth it but for $24 it is overpriced. My partner had snapper for $43 and it was very bland with no taste at all, I could honestly say I do cook fish better at home, and for this price I would expect better quality. If I were the one ordering this dish, I would immidiately send it back to the kitchen, it was just tasteless. The appetizer Saganaki we got was in flames and looked very intersting, it wasn't bad. I saw many people ordering baby back lamb ribs, maybe this is a good dish but I don't know as I haven't tried it. 
The 3 starts only for the service and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here for a normal dinner and for Winterlicious and I'd say to opt for the former to get the real experience. The food was a lot better on a regular night. They have a lot of seafood on the menu, but this place isn't authentically Greek. I'd call it more Greek-inspired. Their calamari and fish specials are really cooked to perfection. The ambience and lighting inside is a bit dark but very calming. The place has a pretty fancy vibe to it and that's probably reflected in the prices too. It's a great place in the financial district for a special dinner especially if you love seafoo"}
{"text":"Location: B+. It is located in a busy area of Toronto, Parking is available at nearby ramps and they are all expensive. However, it is very close to a subway stop and within walking distance from several of the hotels in this part of town.

Decor: A-. Clean and well-kept. Tables are reasonably comfortable.

Service: A. This restaurant is quite busy as it is overall well-written up. We were at this restaurant twice and both times without reservations, but the personnel was nice and worked with us so that on both instances we were able to sit at the bar's tables which happened to be not bad at all. Service was courteous and reasonably prompt. Not particularly fast, but that could be a consequence that they are almost fully booked all the time.

Menu: A- Good selection of wines. I was surprised to realize that there are so many Greek wines. Bear selection less appealing. As far as the food is concerned, the dishes are somewhat comprehensive, but the variety is limited. I have patronized other Greek restaurants, in the US mostly, were the menu was quite a bit more extensive. I am also a big fan of combination platters that offer a chance to sample a variety of dishes, but this is not doable here. In two sittings my wife and I were able to sample a good amount of the short menu and, overall, the execution of each dish was quite good. So, quality of menu is fine, it is just the length of it that puts me a little off. 

While there are alternatives to Estiatorio Volos when it comes to Greek food in Toronto, the majority of them are located in Greektown (Danforth Street) which requires a little commute (it is also served by the subway system, luckily) those establishment do not offer the same quality of fine dining settings and, while their menu is occasionally more extensive, we found that the quality of their dishes did not match the quality at Volos. They are also less expensive, truth be told. 
Hence Volos is indeed one of the best bet for someone who wants to experience Greek cuisine while in Toronto in a fine dining setting.

Reservation must be strongly encouraged as this restaurant is currently very popular and it is not particularly big."}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious some weeks ago. App was shrimp saganaki, lamb shank for main, chocolate mousse for dessert. Shrimp was best of the three but did not come flaming as name suggested. Shrimp was fresh and cooked to perfection. Lamb shank was dry in some parts, moist in others. Mash and spinach were flavourful. Flavour of the main dish was good but not special. Dessert was too thick to be called a mousse. It was really a ganache like you get in a chocolate truffle. The thick consistency made the dessert too rich. A few more berries would have helped cut the richness. Liked free saganaki with check in but you only get one per table. Overall: good flavours but nothing outstanding. Service was attentive and seating comfortable."}
{"text":"Came for the winterlicious 2018 menu. Was a nice catchup with friends/date place with a nice ambience and open kitchen concept. Almost all the tables order a flaming cheese dish, don't remember what it's called since I'm lactose intolerant. The food definitely had a Mediterranean feel to it with all the seafood - my fave! Seafood and lamb was good quality, would definitely come again"}
{"text":"Check in and get the free saganaki!! That may have been the highlight of our meal. Delicious triangle of flaming cheese doused with lemon juice, the perfect blend of sour and salty.

After eating an entire saganaki to myself (with baguette slices), I was already quite full. But the mains came and my appetite was back! We had the whole grilled sea bass and the lamb shank.

I preferred the fish but my counterpart preferred the lamb! Both were very tasty - I think it was just a matter of which dish we started off with first (cause it was hotter when we ate it). By the time we switched plates with each other, they had cooled down significantly.

Lamb shank was fall-off-the bone, but I wouldn't say it stood out to me flavour-wise. The whole fish was really nice, and was paired with nice sides."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Greek food however this place has changed that. The set meal option was absolutely delicious with generous portions. Totally worth every penny from delicious flavours to fabulous service and flaming saganaki to die for. I had the Calamari, Lamb Shank, Chocolate Mousse. I'll definitely be back with more friends! Thank you"}
{"text":"I attributed not having a fondness for Greek food to the fact that I had not gone to enough Greek restaurants, so rather than doing a Greek food crawl or what have you at the Danforth I decided to check Volos out and see what dining in a fancier Greek restaurant in the Entertainment District would be like. 

On first impression there is little to dislike about Volos, a modern restaurant that's got the ambiance for a nice night out, very friendly and professional staff to go along with a convenient location close to a lot of other venues that could make up a complete night's experience in the city. They even have a $36/person \"Theatre\" menu that consits of 4 or 5 courses you can order, and I would assume they probably don't make you wait too long if you're catching a show. 

Over the two times I've been here, I've loved both recommended Greek wines, particularly a red wine that could possibly be one of the better reds I've had. Mental note to spend more time in the Greek wine aisle at the LCBO next time. 
All my dishes here were excellent, although one of the times the server ran the wrong starter but he did rectify his mistake and brought along the right order eventually. It was a sort of win for us as we got to sample both aps. 
I'm not big on Moussaka, but my dining partner who ordered it loved it, so for all you Moussaka fans this place apparently does it well. The calamari starter and beef cutlet would have to be the favourite items from what I tried and although I remember really enjoying it, I can't quite recall what we ordered for dessert. 

The prices here are not surprising considering the whole set up, for a reasonable amount you can definitely have a top notch meal here. I'm definitely a big fan of Volos, after trying it out I did venture to more restaurants in the Danforth area and while not every experience has been amazing, I can say that I no longer shun away from Greek dining experiences :)"}
{"text":"What a lovely place!  We were looking for a central location to meet someone for dinner and the reviews spoke very highly of this place...plus, I love Greek food.  The atmosphere is beautiful, the service was impeccable and the food was amazing.  I started with the traditional soup, enjoyed the moussaka as my entree per the recommendation of the server and my coworker, and finished with the chocolate mousse - absolutely a divine meal!"}
{"text":"Second time at this restaurant. Very nice ambience for dinner and is located right behind the Sheraton centre. Parking lot is right underneath the Hilton hotel for $10."}
{"text":"Although the food was very good, it wasn't unique enough to pique my interest and feel like I got value for money.  Since discovering Yelp, I tend to frequent places with character, that have something different to offer, with a fun comfortable environment. 

Located in the financial district,and on a weeknight, I felt like it was too pretentious and stuffy in terms of the vibe. Not to mention that my chair was too tall for the table and my DP who was lower on the couch. It's a small thing, but takes away from the comfort I like when I'm dining. 

I feel like the vibe is much more different on a Fri or Sat night, as the clientele would be different as well. Nonetheless, I would recommend this place as a great pre-ballet or opera venue, especially if you take your older family members. 

Food wise, it's greek food, but finely prepared - still a little overpriced for portion size and preparation effort. The phyllo pastry is something that is usually  made in mass quantities and cut up, as is the baklava. I'm not undermining the preparation as I\"m not an expert, but $30 for a small plate with a salad that had barely any dressing or effort, isn't something I want to spend my money on. 

HOWEVER, they do offer a great $36 prix-fixe menu that made it all seem a little bit more worth it. I did like my Calamari (which would have normally cost $10+, for two small pieces), and got the Exohico Lamb with cheese in Phyllo as well as a choice of dessert (greek yogurt and honey, I can make this at home!) or Bakalva (very tasty). 

Despite all this, I'm reading other reviews and seems like the portion sizes have been cut down on the prix fixe menu. 

If I had a choice, I'd prefer the Gabardines down the street, except it was all booked up!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Friday night for dinner. I like the atmosphere, it's simple and elegant. Servers are very friendly too. 

My friend has been here for a couple times and she really loves the grilled fish, and that's also the reason she brought me here. So I'll start with the grilled fish. I think it's pretty good - very crispy on the skin and tender inside, nice blend of sides of veggies, and it was a large fish (maybe it'll less so if you order the de-boned fillet). I def did not disappoint. 

Other dishes we got:
- Watermelon and Feta Salad: I really loved this; gave me a perfect start of the night
- Grilled Calamari: my friend ordered this and I tried a bite, it's not bad. I'm not a fan of calamari but this one is full of flavor and not as chewy as the calamaris i had before. And the portion is big for an appetizer.
- Chocolate mousse - not a fan of chocolate dessert, but my friend liked it, very silky but very sweet too. 
- Figs and Greek Yogurt: OMG this is heavenly!!! My friend brought me here for the fish but I know I will definitely come back for the yogurt!!I It's the THICKEST and most creamy yogurt i've never tasted. If you are a fan of greek yogurt, you absolutely don't want to miss this!! 

Thant said, this place is still a bit over-priced. Our total bill was $198 (inc. tax and tips)  and it surprised me a bit. Things were good,  but just as another yelper said, it's just failed to make me feel it worth every penny."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, simply cooked food. The service was great and accomodating. The octopus and saganki apps were cooked perfectly and beautifully presented. Our fish entre√©s were also tender and flavorful! Wish we lived here to enjoy it again! So good!"}
{"text":"We came here for the Summerlicious. This restaurant was initially one of my options for my bachelorette party dinner in August. That is the reason why I wanted to try the Summerlicious menu out. Was I ever glad I didn't select this restaurant for the party.

I've ordered the Shrimp Saganaki
Ouzo, Feta, Tomato sauce

There were 4-5 decent sized shrimp but the shrimp doesn't taste marinated enough. 


Grilled Whole Mediterranean Seabass
Roasted Potatoes, Seasonal Vegetables

The fish just tasted warm. When a fish is served as a whole and just warm, no matter how fresh the fish is won't taste good. 


Chocolate Mousse
The consistency and flavour was nice.

I l've ordered a glass of wine. But I felt invisible throughout the meal. I've reminded myself an hour ago, when I was at the restaurant beside Ritz Carlton enjoying a buck a shuck oysters with excellent service, hence I am still alive and not invisible! At Volos, the table on the right did not order off the Summerlicious menu and ordered two bottles of wine and the table on the left ordered a few bottles of wine. My boyfriend didn't order any drink at all. 

The server didn't even ask me how my food was, did not refill my water. We ended up having to pour the water ourselves as we luckily got access to this water on top of the decor barrel.  In essence, if they decide to treat Winterlicious clients as invisible second class citizen, I suggest they do not participate in Winterlicious or Sunmerlicious in the future. As Summerlicious is supposed to promote the restaurant. Not to turn customers away. Very disappointing experience and just ruined my evening!"}
{"text":"Good food BUT the service left a lot to be desired and hence the overall value we received did not justify their high prices.

When we received our main courses we mentioned that we wanted to cancel the one appetizer we were going to share and were informed by our waiter that \"he is not our slave\" and went on to lecture us why we were wrong.   Bottom line, if you must eat there, make sure you get a \"courteous\" waiter!

M.S."}
{"text":"Volos continues to stand out as the number one high end Greek restaurant in the city. Atmosphere and service are impeccable.  Appetizers such as dolmades and saganaki are so good you'll order seconds.  Not your typical Greek mains.  I had the lamb shank which fell off the bone."}
{"text":"Volos, Volos, Volos.... I'm not sure what it really means but I'm going to go and say that it is synonymous to amazing, awesome and thumbs...

Went for dinner Monday night with mom and my cousin. Not everything is 110% but here is what I am suggesting.

1. Octopus! Don't like octopus? Doesn't matter. You will love this dish with its Moroccan spices and perfectly cooked consistency. It also comes with a little bit of salad, figs and olives... Winner.

2. Lamb rack or shank. There is no wrong answer. Not saucy but full of flavour.

The seafood is solid too. The halibut gets better with every bite and the giant scallops are giant... Slightly blackened for that smokey flavour. 

Also, one tip... Santorini wine is mind blowing. Try a glass of the white. You will love it or send me hate mail...

OPA!!!!!!

PS. Shout out to our server Brianna. You. Were. Fab-tastic. And cute as a button!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant. I went with my daughter, my niece. We all enjoyed the food and service. Our waiter had a charming personality and made great recommendations, Everything that we had was delicious. My niece had the sesame crusted salmon and it was perfect (a nice crunch on the outside). I had a dish that begins with an X (I can't remember the name nor could I pronounce it). The dish had lamb rib meat inside of phyllo dough it was delicious. My daughter had a seafood dish with rice. We loved that too. We all tried each other's dishes and enjoyed them all. I can't remember the waiter's name, but he was the best. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is warm and cozy in a Greek and contemporary way. If I ever go back to Toronto, I will definitely make it a point to go to Volos...."}
{"text":"The reviews had me expecting much better fare. The place is really nice with an excellent ambiance and good service but the dishes were all mediocre to weak.
The tzatziki was tasteless, the octopus a bit tough (and a tiny portion), and the zucchini chips covered in too much batter.
The sea bass was very good, though also very small for the price. They also pour very small drinks, even my doubles were tiny.
Oh well, nothing ventured..."}
{"text":"Love coming here pre-theatre. For appetizers, I've tried the saganaki (pan fried Greek cheese), soutzoukakia (meatballs) and the dolmades ( stuffed grape leaves) All were so well prepared - no complaints and the saganaki (melty and salty goodness) is my favorite. For mains, I've tried the slow roasted lemon chicken (meh, it's chicken), exohico (phyllo pastry, lamb, feta) was outstanding, and seafood kritharoto (orzo with seafood) was amazing. I would recommend the latter two. Service is friendly and attentive.  And efficient - got us to the ballet on time!"}
{"text":"This is a 41/2 star restaurant. This food is excellent and the service is really good. You should try this Greek restaurant if you haven't yet. My wife had a whole fish and I had a salmon dinner the fish is very tasty and sweet. The rice is also very tasty."}
{"text":"A return visit - a restaurant where I have always enjoyed the food. 

It is impressive how the whole reservation system works...you call, and an SMS and email soon arrive...such good affirmation.

We were pleasantly welcomed on arrival about our return albeit we are irregular visitors a long way from home. We were attended to by three servers all helpful however some of the conversations were repeating themselves.

We shared a starter of grilled octopus...tasty and well presented. The seabass was excellent - it was as good as fish can be. The seafood kritharoto was good however on this occasion it has to be said that we have tried  better.

Wine was good and well described by the server.

This is a good restaurant - however there are little aspects that do not allow it to be great like the one dish just not as good as it could be....and also the duplication of server activity.

All said I love coming and naturally will be back - I would like to see the full potential reached for when it does it will be very hard to get into."}
{"text":"It may sound wierd, but I judge a restaurant pretty hard by its complimentary bread. This place gave me a great first impression with its fresh bread and accompanying olive oil. As for the rest of the meal, a little disappointing:

What we ordered:
- Saganyaki: I was super excited for my first flaming-piece-of-cheese experience. Unfortunately, after the excitement and flames (Literally. Ha. ) died down, I found the dish to be too salty. If you also find this to be true? Ask for more bread and eat them together for a tasty, less salty, grilled cheese. 
- Salmon: Great flavour but texture ran a little on the dry side
- Moussaka: Better than the fast food places but also not sure it is worth the $19

The restaurant does offer good service and atmosphere though, making it a perfect rounded, A-OK, 3 star establishment."}
{"text":"Just amazing. This is by far the best Greek restaurant I have been to, and probably among the best in the city.   The menu is apparently inspired by the home-cooked meals of the owners' roots in Greece.  Although I did have a usually generic dish, Mousaka, this was the best I've ever had. 

The server was top notch. Our waiter had a good knowledge of the wine selection and which wines go with which entrees and seemed very passionate each dish on the menu.

The place is great for groups, we were 10 and there was still a few big tables left over for other parties.

Appetizer, Entree, 1 bar rail, 1 glass of wine = $65, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"I'm rarely disappointed by Yelp but this was a major disappointment. Four stars? Are they padding? If they are padding the padders are not voting with their feet - the restaurant was less than half full at 8pm on a Friday. It takes real performance to fill a restaurant every night, not just padded Yelp reviews.

I ordered the special Volos sausage appetizer after the server refused my request to sell me some tastes of a variety of appetizers. This was despite the invitation on the menu to make special combination requests. He delivered a massive plate of sausage with some bell peppers thrown on. The plate would have satisfied a large hungry dog and had about as much art as one would employ to make a dish for a dog. The appearance might have passed for the dog's stool, but I'm being excessive. I enjoyed several tasty bites and threw away most of the dish to save room for the Moussaka I ordered as my main.

The Moussaka was fine but I could have microwaved the same at home from the Wal Mart freezer shelf. It was just not particularly interesting.

Had this place been a cheap oooopa yelling cheese burning Greek family restaurant or at a food court I would have been satisfied, but the pomp, pricing, and rating of Volos set me up for a major letdown. 

I found the service intrusive and the d√©cor weird. What is up with the rows of empty picture frames?"}
{"text":"I came here for biz. Sat at the bar. Asked what I should definitely have. Bartender was awesome. Suggested the octopus app and halibut. Octopus was amazing. Not chewy and the pur√©e on the side was delicious. Also got the lamb app \"signature dish\" which was good but was trumped by the delicacy of the octopus, so I could've done without it.  Halibut fell apart-also excellent. 

Drinks were awesome-I had a Modroni (see pic) for pre-dinner drink which was fantastic! and then some nice Greek white wine with dinner. Would totally recommend this place to all! Really a 4.5 star outing for me! I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant and food! Definitely get the flaming cheese! The service was excellent and the food was great. I asked them to change up my dish a little bit and they accommodated."}
{"text":"HEY PRETTY PARTY PEOPLE!

It's party time! In high style! With fun friends and foodilicious eats in a fabulous space! 

For those who want to plan a little dinner soiree for yourself or a special event for that special someone, Estiatorio VOLOS is where it's at!

TIP: Make reservations well in advance as this place is always hip & happening. 

For our table of 18, they reserved the BEST SEAT in the HOUSE for our party! Centre stage, under the massive funky lighting, and a single long table with the spotlight on us. Not too shabby!

We ordered and we ate and we loved! 

SAGANAKI
Kefalotyri Sheep's Milk Cheese, with Metaxa Brandy & Lemon
(Deep-fried gooey cheese sticks)

BEEF MOUSSAKA
Thin layer of Eggplant, Zucchini, Yukon Gold Potato with a Kasseri & Kefalotyri
Cheese (Lasagne-like)

BECHAMEL EXOHICO
Phyllo Pastry, Braised Lamb, Vegetables, Feta & Kefalotyri Cheeses with Lamb Jus
(Not too filling if you want a lighter meal) ***

SEAFOOD KLEFTIKO
Phyllo Pastry, Salmon, Shrimp, Whitefish, Spinach, Leeks & Feta Cheese with a Dill Beurre Blanc
(Another dish on the lighter side) ***

SEAFOOD KRITHAROTO
Orzo with Wild Salmon, Tiger Prawn, Calamari, Mussels & Kefalotyri Cheese
(Risotto lovers will love this one) ***

VOLOS FARFALLE PASTA
Cherry Tomatoes, Swiss Chard, Kalamata Olives, Feta & Goat Cheeses in a Garlic, Olive Oil Sauce (Excellent pasta dish)

ROASTED SUPREME CHICKEN ***
Julienned Pear, Almond & Quinoa Salad
This was MY dish. I spotted various people ordering this one and due to popular demand, WHY NOT?!?!?! 

VERDICT? 
I have to say, it is the best roasted chicken I have had in the T-Dot thus far! Succulent, juicy, with the skin a bit on the crispy toasty side. I ate this in blissful silence! ... mmmmmMMMMM ...

FOR DESSERT

TRADITIONAL BAKLAVA
Phyllo Pastry, Honey, Walnuts & Pistachios 
(Much.Too.Sweet)

SAFFRON AND PISTACHIO ICE CREAM
It wasn't that it tasted bad, it was one of those Foodie Adventure moments where one surprisingly discovers one is NOT a fan of flowery tasting ice cream! And the pistachio ice-cream? Creamy and smooth but also too sweet for my liking.

JUST RIGHT
The spot our table was located in the restaurant was not too noisy (so we can hear each other talk) NOR was it too quiet (we didn't feel like we were being rude or obnoxious). It felt like a private dinner party in one of the poshest restaurants in town. And everything was simply FABULOUS! 

WHAT SERVICE!
The service was really outstanding! Felt very high-end without being snobbish. Drinks always full, food served at a reasonable timing, not super friendly, but not rude, just simply professional. With 18 people, we got separate bills with no confusion in the charges. 

It was a special evening for a special event and the food and ambiance and service just made it THAT much more memorable! 

Va-va-va-voooom! Get yourself to Estiatorio VOLOS!"}
{"text":"I was at Volos for a work dinner on a Monday evening. Its hard to say how busy the place usually as, as the group I was with was a part over 100 people...

1. Atmosphere: modern but with a touch of warmth. Cool lighting! The 'foyer'/bar area was a bit crowded for a group our size, we felt like we were in a club yelling to have a conversation with each other. But once we got to our tables, the ambience was terrific with candles at the table and a great view outside through large windows.

2. Food. AMAZING. For appetizer I had the grilled Calamari, done to perfection, not chewy served with  delicious tomato based dressing. Dinner was Moussaka. My mouth is just watering writing about it! I would describe it as Mediterranean style lasagna with melt in your mouth (literally) creamy topping, and layers of flavour. For dessert I had ice cream for which the life of me cannot recall the flavour, but it was tasty. Other people at my table enjoyed the baklava for dessert-a very generous helping! (you could easily split it between two people). 

3. Service: our waiter was polite and attentive. The bar staff was also very helpful.

Overall a surprisingly excellent restaurant in the financial district. I would definitely go back there for more Moussaka! I would recommend dressing 'up' for this place, you might feel a little out of place in your Sunday jeans and tshirt."}
{"text":"O M G.

Dining at VOLOS was the perfect way to end the week. The atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxing; there are a lot of candles and cultured ornaments (ie. vases on stands, engravings on the wall) displayed all over. Even the door frames and textiles added liveliness to the Greek restaurant's culture. The service was also very delightful, we were well catered to with respect to the timing of food served, as well as water refilled. Additionally, the staff was well-humoured, sociable, and extremely courteous (way beyond expectations). 

Summerlicious dinner ~$35
Grilled Moroccan Octopus (VOLOS Organic Olive Oil & Balsamic Dressing) - octopus was juicy and succulent and topped with a minimalistic amount of balsamic glaze; I've also never tried arugula this grassy which was delish; it was served with a side of green coloured puree which I couldn't quite figure out

Braised Lamb Shank (Feta Mashed Potatoes, Swiss Chard & Crispy Leeks) - the lamb was extremely tender and literally fell off the bone once my knife touched it! the crispy leek garnishing was a very interesting touch of something-something; the chard has a dry chewy texture but went extremely well with the richly flavoured and delicious mashed potatoes (I'm drooling just thinking of it)

Traditional Baklava (Phyllo Pastry, Honey, Walnuts & Pistachios) - the phyllo layers were separated with the top being flakier and crispy, and the bottom had crushed nuts sitting on a honey-drenched layer, which was reminiscent of a granola bar; served with a dash of strawberries and blueberries 

Lastly, I was intrigued by these flaming dishes that were served around our tables, and they turned out to be the flaming cheese appetizer~$13
Saganaki (Kefalotyri Cheese, Ouzo & Lemon) - the server would come out to flame the cheese and put it out with lemon juice immediately before putting it on our table. It was quite a unique sight that happened to be extremely tasty as well. The cheese was like a saltier version of Parmesan (which happens to be one of my fave), and it was well savoured. I could barely taste the sweetness from the Ouzo but that was completely okay! The outside of the cheese was crispy and the inside was really chewy and just a tad stringy. This dish has heightened my standards for cheese.

 Hands down the most pleasant summerlicious experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"This has quickly become the go-to place when my mom wants to take me out for a nice dinner after work (our offices are both close to here downtown).

We usually order the saganaki (aka flaming cheese doused in liquor, trust me its amazing) thanks to the check in offer from Yelp - too awesome!

I have tried a couple of their seafood dishes (mainly the salmon or swordfish) - each time was delicious. Their spanikapita is also quite yummy as well.

We usually order the chocolate mousse for dessert, its so so dreamy. Highly recommend trying this if you are a chocolate lover."}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2017 Lunch ($23)

We were a large party (8 people) for the Winterlicious lunch special. We were promptly seated upon arrival in the very back of the restaurant and given abundant amount of bread (they will refill the bread when you finish it). We did have a hard time to get our bills at the very end of the meal (we had to wait for 20 minutes and call the server twice) but other than that, service was great. 

I had the octopus salad, the youvetsi chicken and the greek yogurt. The octopus salad was quite good, chopped up octopus on a bed of arugula with some feta and olives. The chicken breast was nice and juicy with a tiny bit of youvetsi sauce on top of it. I would have liked a bit more sauce. The marinate on the chicken was also a bit on the salty side and there were two whole pepper corn in my chicken, making those two bites quite unpleasant. The yogurt was nice and refreshing, a great tartness and creaminess. 

The whole experience felt as a whole  bit like a generic \"higher end\" chain restaurant (e.g. joey) with standard dishes but nothing exciting or new."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great. Group ordered the Spetzofia VOLVOS which is a lamb sausage. Delicious.  Flabeed Saganaki  (they set some cheese on fire,  nice and salty), and the Grilled Moroccan Octopus. All were delicious. The octopus was even better with a squeeze of lemon,  so try and taste it both ways. Excellent. 

I had the Seafood Krotharoto.  Salmon, prawns, calamari and mussels in a delicious tomato sauce. Great with their bread. 

Others liked their Cornish Game Hen, Pan Seared Halibut, and Fishermans Stew (salmon, prawns, calamari, mussels in a saffron sauce).

Friends shared the baklava, some had coffee. I tried the Greek Merlot wine. Xinomavro, Syrah, Merlot blend called \"Paranga\" Kir Yianni Naoussa. I had low expectations because I thought that Greek wines were rated poorly. This was terrific. Complex, with a long finish. 

Our server was very helpful. Real classy place. Will visit again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for winterlicious and walked out the door satisfied.
I was afraid with a winterlicious experience it would fall short but it didn't.

What stole the show was the grilled octopus. Perfectly grilled, seasoned, still tender and juicy. The garlic dip that accompanied it was garlicky but mellow (in a good way).

The lobster orzo (that was like risotto) was okay at best. The lamb shank with the crispy fried leeks and feta mashed potatoes was pretty f**king good.

The dessert was okay, I hate to say it, but I've had better baklava.

So if you're ever there don't miss out on the octopus!"}
{"text":"I went for a winterlicious lunch and this was definitely a pleasantly nice alternative to the usual financial district staple (along the likes of jump, bymark, canoe)!

I had the meatballs for apps and it was tasty with a hint of cinnamon. The exohico for main was yummy, crispy and filling and baklava was nutty and not too sweet.

Definitely a great place to consider for a nice restaurant in the area and I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service Great food. R.A Dickey was in the spot with his family. Choclate moose for dessert. EPIC !! :)"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Greek
Menu items: Kefalotyri Cheese, Giant Sea Scallops and Moussaka paired with a lovely Kastropolitia white wine

Greek food to me has always been about shish kebabs and Greek salads sprinkled with enormous amounts of feta cheese. Nothing wrong with that, until you try real authentic and well prepared Greek food. Visiting Volos, in a non-Greek location such as Toronto's financial district, gave me a new appreciation for the \"Gods'\" food.

Before I start off with the mains, let me open up your appetites with the greatest discovery I had at Volos...Kastropolitia white wine. Being a little bit reserved with my wine selection, and having never tried Greek wine, I admit I was not really holding my breath for it. I was very happy to realize I was wrong. This fantastic wine not only brought me joy, but also expanded my horizons that much more!

Dry with a pale golden colour and a fresh fruity flavour, the Kastropolitia reserve was tasty on the palate and smooth as you sipped through it. Needless to say, half a bottle later I was still enjoying this wine.

And what goes better with wine than cheese? The answer is, Greek cheese!
Kefalotyri cheese was the selection that night. And in case you are wondering, yes it did come with the flames entertainment followed by our waiter politely saying out loud \"Opa!\". It does not get more Greek than that.
The cheese was simply tasty. Mostly made from sheep's milk, bathed in some brandy and sprinkled with a bit of lemon, its texture was crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. My food exercise that night consisted of sipping wine, then having some cheese, sipping wine, then more cheese, and so on and so forth.

As I was obviously just starting my meal, I decided on a small appie, the Gigantic Sea Scallops!  You know what they say, go big or go home! And so we decided not to go home that night. These scallops, quite honestly, were the best thing I had at Volos. Only the Greeks would mix the Mediterranean way of eating eggplant (aka, grilled then pureed) with seafood. It looked like these huge scallops were Zeus and the pureed eggplant beneath them were the clouds representing the skies. OK, maybe too much wine drinking on my end, but you get the point. They were delicious, perfectly seasoned and cooked just right.

After indulging in quite the selection of wine, cheese and appetizers, I finally got to try, and for the first time I should say, the famous Moussaka.
The one ingredient that stood out - Kefalotyri Cheese B√©chamel sauce. Throughout the entire dish, you tasted this delicious white sauce. Not too overpowering or bland, just done right.  
Moussaka is an eggplant based dish from the Mediterranean. The Greeks have actually \"own\" this dish for quite some time and have made a delicacy of it. The Volos Moussaka is a layered dish containing thinly sliced pieces of eggplant, zucchini and Yukon gold potatoes, seasoned ground beef, Kasseri cheese and the very beautiful Kefalotyri B√©chamel sauce I just described. Another one of Volos' hits. Opa!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Came here for valentine's day and it was great. They serve up delicious Saganaki (flaming greek cheese) where they flambeau it at your table, thats an awesome touch! We split a bottle of greek white wine as well. For our mains, we ordered the fisherman's stew and lamb shank, both delicious but the fisherman's stew was the ultimate winner. A must try if you are looking for a satisfying seafood dish! Finished it off with a chocolate cake... great date spot!"}
{"text":"I recently came here with my girlfriend and was very impressed with the food. We ordered the l grilled calamari and sagnaki to start. I ordered the lamb shank and my girlfriend ordered the scallops. We were both impressed with our meals. The lamb was cooked perfectly and the scallops were fresh. We ended the meal with the baklava and flourless chocolate cake, and both were delicious. 

The service was a bit slow and we had to repeatedly flag the waiter down for drink refills and for the bill. 

Overall, great food and great atmosphere. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"It's a great Greek dining!

I've been to Greece...once...years ago...I mostly ate pasta there I think (that's right, what the hell?!) So from experiences at Souvlaki Express and such I assumed Greek cuisine is summed up to souvlaki, gyros and tzatziki. Who knew Greeks are so creative (just kidding. The residents of Olympus had to be eating better than that).

Ive been to Volos on a few occasions. Now, it's a fine dining restaurant that uses high quality produce, has great service and is priced accordingly BUT portions are quite big which makes the value worthy. And there are many healthy options for those who are watching their diet (yep, that would be me)

DO EAT:

*Healthy and Delicious: 
Organic Baby Kale Salad, Horiatiki Salad - so fresh and amazing
Grilled Calamari (whole not rings), Grilled Moroccan Octopus
Giant Sea Scallops, Grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass

*Simply Delicious:          
Saganaki- sheep's milk salty cheese that they set on Ouzo fire right at ur table (!) goes very well with the bread
Sesame crusted feta cheese in orange infused honey (do I need to say more?)
Spetzofai - roasted lamb sausage in tomato sauce that is very flavorful
Braised lamb shank - just melts in your mouth
Black Sesame Wild Pacific Salmon
Exohico and Kleftiko were enjoyed much by my friends.

*A Bite of Heaven:          
Ouzo Chocolate Mousse, Flourless Chocolate cake - JUST HAVE THOSE!

The place has a very nice classy atmosphere, mature clientele and staff, not noisy so you can hold a proper conversation. 

PS: I think I saw Apollo himself (or blame it on delicious Greek wine). All I know is that he's tall and gorgeous (I think he's a manager or an owner or something like that)"}
{"text":"It's as if a Greek family invited me over to their house  for some home-cooked food. As a plus, the family has a classy place. It's in the financial district with easy access from the downtown hotels. Reminds me of that trip years ago to Santorini or Mykanos sans the big Pelican, without the windmills, without the rocky beaches, without backpackers and in fact without the whole country of Greece. I just like my Greek meal simple: Moussaka and ouzo. Maybe meatballs and ouzo. Maybe keftedakia me ouzo. Maybe kataifi, baklava and amygdalopita....OK, I'd give it that extra star only if this place was in the Aegean with me lying on some beach looking up at the *****."}
{"text":"yummy!!

Tucked away in the financial district Volos is a mediterranean restaurant that is participating in this years summerlicious 2013.  The ambience, decor, and overall atmosphere is chic, with a twist of mediterranean  comtemporary design with its pottery, and green glass lamps that hang.  Not to mention the greek writting paved on the walls of this place really gives you a cultural sense of where you are. 

The food is very intriguing from a culinary perspective, especially their watermelon feta salad drizzled with a light raspberry vinegarette...its fresh, and refreshing flavors gives this dish a perfecto 5/5!!

For their entree we had their Exohico : Phyllo Pastry, Braised Lamb & Vegetables, Feta & Kefalotyri Cheeses with Lamb Jus. Think of it as your much bigger SPANAKOPITA! decisiously hands down, the infused flavors of the pulled lamb, greens, feta to only be craddled in their flakey filo dough was an absolute sexy time in your mouth!!

For dessert their Ouzo Chocolate Mousse Semi-sweet Dark Chocolate Mousse & Ouzo Chantilly was a nice way to conclude our lunch.  Perfect balance of dark chocolate and smooth mousse really helped was key, as it would have been too bitter. Nonetheless a treat!! 4/5"}
{"text":"Very nice establishment with an excellent menu. All the food I seen walk past me, looked stunning and from judging by other patrons, it seemed to taste phenomenal as well. Sadly I only had drinks here tonight as dinner was already committed to with a group elsewhere. 
I've never come across this place before and only walked into it by accident when I was looking to have a couple of beers with some colleagues. I will be back at this place for sure and will sample their menu. 
My rating above  as based on the ambiance, service, menu and judging by the enjoyment of others :)"}
{"text":"Great service, food, ambiance, and wine selection. I had a nice time and felt like a high end experience in a fairly casual place. Lighting was romantic but light enough to see your company."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars for food  service, ambience and price. Everything went very well. Brett, our server was exceptional. 

We decided to try this place for the first time after our spa session, gotta pamper ourselves as women, at least sometimes. We Yelp and found this place so we decided to give it a try. We were seated promptly upon arrival. The ambience was nice and quiet. Great for date nite and/or gathering with a few close friends.

Upon checking in with Yelp, there was a free appetizer, the saganaki ($13 value) and it was delicious..I guess I don't know Greek/Mediterranean food too well..didn't know cheese could be pan friend/baked. It was very interesting add to our mains. We ordered the grilled octopus, moussaka and the seafood kritharoto. Portions and taste, everything worked well in harmony. 

We also ordered a bottle of white wine to pair with our menu. Some interesting wine menu with Greek wines. 

All in all, a place I will come back without any doubts."}
{"text":"This place was good, but given the reviews I've seen, I expected better. I ventured to Estiatorio for dinner during Winterlicious and got the dolmades, Cornish hen, and pistachio and saffron ice cream. Both the dolmades and ice cream were delicious. The Cornish hen was good, but not fantastic. The ice cream bowl was ice cold, which made me think that much of the food was done ahead of time for the Winterlicious menu, which is probably part of the reason I wasn't floored by the food. The glass of wine I got was quite good. 

The host was exceptionally friendly and attentive. Our server didn't have the inexplicable ability to gauge timing that I usually see at highly rated restaurants. 

Anyway, I enjoyed myself, but it seemed as though some corners were cut for Winterlicious."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we found this Greek gem in Toronto.  And, thanks to the reviews, we tried the Saganaki, which was so delicious, as well as the Sea Bass.  We also had the arugula salad.  Everything was so delicious!  The ambiance of the restaurant was very classy and was definitely a good date place.  The service was impeccable as well.  We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Came to celebrate nye 2013 with family. The menu was awesome, Food was great and the waiters are very friendly."}
{"text":"Nice decor and great service, although the food wasn't as great as I thought I would be-more like ok. This place is not cheap as usually it is with other Greek restaurant I've been to, and the portions are not as big either. We've had a good time though celebrating my birthday, but I most likely will not go back. Overall 3 stars is more than enough"}
{"text":"What a GEM - charming decor and fantastic cuisine.  

I was in town for a quick business trip and was delighted to find this place by chance.  Menu has diverse range, substantial to lighter options, something extremely important to me when dining clients.  

Highly recommend, will be coming back next time I'm up here."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner at the beginning of the year during winter, we went to see Shenyun at the Four Seasons, so we wanted something fast since we were on a tight schedule.  We came upon this place due to its proximity to four seasons and it looked interesting. We had tasty food(as I can't remember what we had now), atmosphere was great as I really liked the high bar styled tables and wall sofas, I found it romantic and comfortable. The clientele was cool as well. Most of all, the service was amazing!! The server was not only attentive but was extremely accommodating with our tight schedule, she tried to deliver food quickly to help us get to our show on time. Would definitely go again! It's a perfect pairing with a show nearby."}
{"text":"Spent the July 4th weekend in Toronto and this place was just down the road from my hotel. As someone who truly appreciates mediterranean cuisine I was looking forward to this place. I ordered the Greek salad which had some of the freshest veggies I have ever had at a Greek restaurant and high quality feta The main was their fresh fish offering and since they were touting it I decided to go for it. It was the branzino grilled over an open flame. While the fish itself was not bad the prep was rather dull. They could've and should've done a lot more with it. Priced at $48 this was a major hit on the rating along with the complacent lackadaisical service..but this may be a Canadian thing as we saw that type of service at other restaurants. I generally try a place twice before rating but I don't see going to this place again so this is it."}
{"text":"One of the greatest Greek restaurant i've been in Toronto. Myself and Randi Zuckerberg had a meeting there and had the best experience. The food is delicious."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with food and the service. We wanted a nice meal and atmosphere to celebrate our 25 anniversary and this was like a take our restaurant, cheap and unfriendly.  The beef tenderloin was drenched in lemon juice and extremely turf and the chicken breast was overwhelming with mint -disgusting. Not edible. Given that we did not want to upset our day we simply paid and left the establishment. This was the worst restaurant that I have ever eaten at. The services at the table was also not very good, cold, impersonal and generally unfriendly.  We had desert at LA next door.
We will never return nor recommend this to our friends."}
{"text":"I came here for some pre-symphony food.  It was incredibly lively at the restaurant, but not too loud that you had to show at people across from you.  The main dining area is large, and bright; great for groups or a date.  

The menu has all of the traditional Greek staples you all crave.  Portion sizes were reasonable and the food was full of flavour.  A nice spot for some upscale Greek food in the heart of the financial district, close to a lot of show spots."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious. It wasn't too busy at lunch time and service was quick. The staff were very friendly. The restaurant is very white, very clean looking and gets a lot of sunshine. I ordered the moussaka as a main and I loved it. It was so creamy and soft. Had the baklava for dessert. It was a little too sweet for my liking and I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Great food and great environment.  Great place for a date.
Finish the night with chocolate moose for desert. 
Service was excellent.
I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good Greek cuisine located in the Entertainment District. We went after a performance of Tristan und Isolde. We didn't have a reservation, but there were many tables available. They asked if we wanted to sit by the door, but I requested something farther away. The manager was happy to oblige, but told us we could have the table until 9:30pm. It was reserved at that time. The food was good. We ordered the prix fixe menu and the portions were just right! Fabulous wine list, with an excellent collection of Greek wines. At 9:45, the manager kindly asked us to leave, saying that the people were waiting for their table for 15 minutes. Upon exiting, we noticed that no one was waiting for a table. There were also at least 5 tables still open. Good food, strange service."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, particularly the lamb, of which, between us, we had both variants.

Only downside was that we were moved through a little too quickly.  It was clear that, if we didn't take too long, then they'd be able to use the table again that evening and so it felt a little like we were on a conveyor belt.

That apart, it was a good evening and we'd go there again."}
{"text":"Review for Winterlicious 2017 Lunch $23

Bread w/ olive oil to start 

Starter: Marinated Octopus Salad ~ I liked the vinaigrette, arugula and olives. Octopus was cooked \"soft\"; I prefer more of a springy/hard bite. Portion is pretty good, lots of octopus pieces. 

Main: Seafood Youvetsi w. Salmon, Tiger Prawn, Mussels, Tomato, Orzo, Feta ~ I really like the sauce! Tomato with a bit of spicy creaminess. Salmon was soft, not dry; prawns had a springy bite. Orzo is very soft so this dish is easy to eat; I think it'd work well as a risotto too.

Dessert: Greek Yogurt w. blueberries, strawberries & honey 

Got a free Saganyaki with Yelp check-in! Flaming cheese... pretty good with the bread. Eat it while it's hot before it hardens!"}
{"text":"Went there for birthday celebration. Exceptional food and service, staffs are friendly and courteous. Definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"Upscale Greek cuisine with attentive staff and superior food worth the visit"}
{"text":"My perspective on Toronto Greek food has changed after dining at Volos, and for the better. In fact, I would not really group this place with other Greek establishments, like found on the Danforth, for there is not a Souvlaki to be seen. In its place are lamb shanks, sumptuous seafood dishes and Cornish hens. 

It's a bit more upscale, but not in a trendy, pretentious way. It's just straight-up good food in an elegant setting. I went with a large group and after indulgently sharing bites off each others' plates, we were all impressed with the consistent quality of all the dishes. It was one of the best meals I had in Toronto in 2012, and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Checked winterlicious tonight! Good food but felt like the same sauce was used for the shrimp saganaki and the seafood kritharoto! Their dark chocolate mousse and flourless chocolate cake was yummyyy"}
{"text":"My stomach hurt after eating here. 

Also, they split the bill incorrectly(I only noticed the next day, dunderhead)
On they phone they told me they will refund me the extra amount they charged me,
but after I walked there they changed the tune (and made me wait 15min first).
Not the way you treat your customers!

UPDATE: Came here for Winterlicious with my coworkers.  The appertizer was alright, the dessert was fine too (hard to screw up icecream), but the main dish was horrid. They clearly do not have a proper chef, like, say, Byblos."}
{"text":"Amazing! I came here with the Yelp crew for Yelp Eats and had a fantastic time.

First I'll get my one complaint out of the way. They've recently changed their menu and a couple old ones are still floating around. The wine I ordered was no longer available. However, Andreas the owner, personally came over to apologize and offer some suggestions based on what I liked. He was even willing to open a bottle of something they don't normally pour by the glass. No need though as he brought over a sample of one which I liked. Overall, a great wine list here. After that it was smooth sailing.

Before taking our order our waiter got our attention and explained a little bit of the history of the restaurant and then followed with the specials for the day.

The table ordered a bunch of different appetizers which we all shared. We almost didn't need dinner the apps were so good. For around $11-15 a plate you get a solid potion and great quality for the price.

For dinner I ordered the Moussaka. The waiter must have done a good job of selling it in as half the table ordered it as well. It melted in my mouth. It was so good I'm at a loss for words, you just need to go here and try it.

Thanks to Andreas for the round of shots of Skita (I think that's what it was called). First time trying it and it was awesome."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a business lunch. We had a party of three and the staff were delightful and helpful. The food was fantastic. I had the Exohico, phyllo pastry stuffed with braised lam and feg with feta and kefalotyri cheeses and lamb au jus. Delicious, tender and done perfectly. My guests had the whole fish dinner (seabass) deboned and the other had the warm seafood salad with Pacific salmon, halibut, scallop, tiger prawn, quinoa and wild arugula. Both guys really enjoyed. We chose not to have wine but rather spring water. Very good."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try out Volos since I love Greek and love seafood. I went for dinner on a Monday night so it was pretty empty. I ordered a tonne of fun to try a little of everything. Horiatiki was fine. Octopus was overcooked and bland. Beans and sauce tasted like from a can. Whole seabass was perfectly cooked yet without sauce of any kind. Meatballs were overcooked and also very poorly flavoured in spaghettios sauce. Wines were lame and overpriced. I really enjoy Greektown and Volos can't compare in food or frankly in ambiance. To charge 4X the cost you gotta do 4X better and you're not even running at par. I won't return and would encourage people seeking Greek to avoid this place and head to Greektown's champions."}
{"text":"I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars- but this was amazing.

What we ate:
- Arugula salad with goat cheese (4/5): Not very complex, but fresh and light.
- Seafood stew with orzo (5/5): I have never had such a great dish. Various types of seafood ( shrimp, halibut, calamari ect.) in a delicious tomato dill sauce and orzo. Perfectly seasoned.Drool.
- Chillean Seabass with roasted veggies (5/5): Not your typical grilled fish. Amazing spice rub and veggies to go with it. 

Although, the food was phenomenal and I will be back again..you are looking at a pretty hefty bill. All together ( 2 apps, 2 mains, 2 glasses of wine) we paid close to $200.

BUT, please go. You will not regret it. Very nice ambiance, perfect for a date or a special family affair."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service. We came here to celebrate our anniversary and the romantic ambience was just right. Chris, our server, was very attentive and checked in on us several times. He also made great recommendations on the meal and explained the food very well. We had the free saganaki, Moroccan octopus, braised lamb shank, and seafood krithroto( not sure how it's spelled). The lamb shank was super tender and fall off the bone. The seafood krithroto was very flavourful. Both dishes were very filling. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is truly special. You are first greeted with a smile and offered to have your coat checked. The food was authentic and simply wonderful. Highly recommend this place. Will be back and bring friends here for sure."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place a lot. From our amazing server to the free appetizer and amazing entrees we couldn't get enough. 
Starting from the wine selection, it was great with some definite unique ones to choose from. A mixture of Ontario wines for those more conservative with their choices to some Greek varieties that I've never seen before for those willing to take a risk. 
Secondly, the fact that you get a free saganaki when checking in!! I love cheese and then it was free and it was a cool instagram story! Win win win. 
We also got the octopus which tasted amazing but personally I needed more for the price. Amazing taste just pleaseeeeee gimme more. 
Lastly, the lamb was the entree for both of us. We loved it and it was just so rich and luxurious on the tongue. 

Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Volos has more of a dim and formal dining setting, so it's not the most cozy and casual but I absolutely love it. Would take visitors here, business guests or come with a large group. Their olive oil is the best I've had in the city, all their dishes are cooked so well, the food quality is very high. Their salmon is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"We had a work lunch here today... The service was excellent, attentive and friendly. The Saganaki was divine and delivered to the table on a flaming cast iron dish, literally! The Italian red wine we had with lunch wasn't amazing. I had the braised lamb shank with feta potato mash. The flavors and textures in this dish were spot on however the shank itself was a little on the grizzle side(I know some people wouldn't mind this at all however i 'm pretty picky when it comes to meat). Baklava for dessert was delicious, ever though I probably didn't need it after all the appetizers and my lamb shank (which was a large serving)"}
{"text":"I frequently stay at the Sheraton across the street and enjoy Volos. The Saganaki is great as well as the Octopus for starters. Whole grilled fish is a winner with the entrees as well as the Seafood Kritharoto. Not super cheap but always enjoyable."}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service.  Ambience was nice and most importantly,  the food was fantastic.  We were a party of two and glad we found this restaurant.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious - absolutely incredible, I could see why it was listed in the top 10 restaurants to check out for Winterlicious 2013!

Started off with the Saganaki, which was very good (though it's hard to do a good Saganaki wrong ;-)), moved on to the Tiger Prawn Saganaki, which had some incredible flavours in the \"saganaki sauce\". I had the Cornish Hen which was extremely flavourful and done to perfection. It came with feta mashed potatoes and spinach - when you ate them together it sort of gave you the taste of a spanakopita. My sister had the lamb which was just falling off of the bone. I'm normally not a big lamb fan but it was pretty amazing. 

For desert I had the flourless chocolate cake, which was great, but not a standout compared to the rest of the meals. My sister had the pressed greek yogurt and raved about it.

The service was really good, and the hostess was very friendly. The atmosphere is really gorgeous - definitely would reccomend to all my friends! Looking forward to coming back for Summerlicious :)"}
{"text":"Being of Greek descent, I am used to & accustomed to Greek cuisine. BIG FAN! You know what to expect when you go into a Greek restaurant. Awesome food! Dining in at Estiatorio Volos, was an in love type of experience, brought on by a modern twist to Greek cuisine. The drink menu was cleaver & delish... The authenticity of a dish remains, while incorporating new flavor & style. My fianc√© & I were at a loss for words with each bite. Just exquisite!!!! I know my boundaries, although I did not want to stop eating. The flavor in each bite was enticing & we were trapped... We needed to finish our meals! A def important destination for your next dining experience in Toronto. Love, love, LOVE Estiatorio Volos!"}
{"text":"Went for Summerlicious lunch at Estiatorio VOLOS and it was awesome.  Had the cucumber salad to start, followed by the lemon chicken and sorbet for dessert.  I think I could have eaten double the chicken - not because the portion was small - but because it was SOOOO GOOD.  The waitress was very accommodating to my lactose issue and ensured my main dish was cheese-free (after I picked around the cheese in the cucumber salad)  I should have asked ahead of time if there was cheese in things or it would have been good if they mentioned the cheese in the description on the menu.  Overall, a great experience at a restaurant that I would not normally eat at.  The only thing is I found it a little noisy and the acoustics are echo-ey (but then again, our group of 10 was noisy but it could have been us!)."}
{"text":"TLDR version - Service was so poor that nobody even bothered to say anything to us after paying - no \"good night\", no token fake smile and certainly no \"thank-you\". Had to get up out of my seat after 15 minutes of failed waving, in order to get the cutlery for my main course.

Firstly, the food here is good - not great, but pretty good! Also, the interior is nice - in the expected, downtown Toronto kind of way. However, no iron chef or interior designer could save this place with it's level of service. 

Also, some of you may read this as me being an asshole to the staff, but I assure you this wasn't the case. I've worked at restaurants growing up. My father even owns a restaurant to this day. I'm the kind of guy that tips 15 - 20% at the very minimum because I've experienced the crap that goes on with working at a restaurant. Nevertheless, I ended up tipping less than 10% at Volos - should have tipped even (see last paragraph). It's almost like they tried to make the experience terrible - I've had better service from the disgruntled middle-aged man at the Tim Horton's I frequent.

Perhaps I got a bad waiter, or perhaps he had bigger fish to fry (in all honesty, there was a table that came in half way through dinner which looked to have spent more on wine within the first 10 minutes of sitting down than we did in total). Nevertheless, there is no excuse for forgetting our cutlery after bringing the main course and leaving us unattended for another 15 minutes afterward. I had to flag the waiter down personally - yes, I had to get up - in order to ask for a fork and knife. Same with water.

You know when they ask you, rhetorically, whether \"everything is alright\"? It's not like anybody ever tells you if something is than perfect anyway, but I should have saw it coming when our waiter began the evening by not asking us, but telling us that everything is alright.  \"Everything IS ALRIGHT! (OK?)\" 

To cap off the evening, we paid and, while I could tell he didn't like his tip, I couldn't have imagined what was about to happen. He ripped the receipt from the machine with disgust, throws it on the table and walks away without saying a damn thing.

Much better service at cheap Chinese restaurants. Again, this may be an isolated case. I'm hoping that's the case."}
{"text":"Went with my husband for a date night after finding other places packed with reservations. I am glad we ended up here! 
We started off with the free saganaki from the yelp check, it makes for a nice entertainment and the cheese is quite nice (very Mediterranean flavour with a kick of lemon to it). On to the apps, I was a bit reluctant to try the calamari because of a few reviews but hubby and I decided to go for it anyway. Luckily we did!! espectacularly cooked octopus and calamari, not squishy at all and the flavor was a bit bbq-ish for the calamari and extraordinary for the octopus. Definitely two must tries! We shared the braised lamb shank for entree and while it was good I wouldn't order it again, I'd rather stick to the apps and try different stuff. The desserts were amazing (baklava and chocolate mousse) but the mousse was definitely the standout! 

Great food, great service and great ambience! Loved it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there on a cold raining night for the winterlicious menu because we heard good reviews about it. It was actually pretty good! The environment is really nice. I love the Greek fusion decor and the light. But I think the music could be a little bit louder since we can hear what the people sat beside us were talking about. 
We were offered the free saganaki after checked in on yelp. The cheese cake with a hot pan with fire which is visually amazing! It's a little bit on the savory side, but as a cheese lover, I think it goes very well with the bread and the wine. The server was really nice, she gave excellent suggestion on the wine which went with the meal perfectly. Btw, there is a wide collection of Greek wine. Really satisfying. 
We had the grilled octopus and the prawn saganaki as the starter. The octopus is super tasty with lemon and arugula salad. And the tiger prawn also tastes really fresh and tender. We finished them so quickly even forgot to take pictures. For entree, I had the salmon and my bf had the lamb shank. The lamb dish is pretty big in portion, with feta mash. The lamb is really tender, the meat fell off the bone immediately. The seasoning is okay, I think it's slightly bland. The salmon is super fresh, and seared perfectly. The seasoning is really nice too. But I don't really like the fragrance of the risotto. I think there's fennel or cumin inside. The desserts are really nice!!!!!!!! I love the taste of cinnamon in the baklava, and the chocolate mousse tastes super balanced! I got to finished both desserts at the end thanks to my boyfriend hahahaha! 
Overall, food 3.5/5, service 4/5, decor 4/5. Maybe next time when I visit, I'll order a few appetizers, and enjoy some other nice Greek wine."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This restaurant is amazing! I was so impressed overall, by the ambience, the service and the food! I dined here as a part of a large group dinner in the private room. I was greeted by a very pleasant hostess in the midst of a busy evening in the restaurant, and I appreciated her attention to each arriving customer. 

Our group dinner was held in the private room which does have doors which close to block out the rest of the restaurant, although you can still hear the noise.

We were greeted with a selection of Septima wines, both white and red, which are amazing, with appetizers including sesame crusted feta, chicken skewers, and spanakopita. Everyone raved about the sesame crusted feta!!

Our set dinner menu included shared appetizers of the horiatiki salad, the grilled octopus, and the saganaki, all of which were amazing!! My main dish was the lobster kritharoto, which I was so excited to try! I have to say though, that I let the restaurant know in advance that I would have to leave early, and unfortunately, the mains came out later than expected, so I really didn't have much time to try this much-anticipated dish. What I was able to try was great! I just wish that I could've finished it, and have experienced the ouzo chocolate mousse I had ordered, but again was not able to experience given the timing of the meal.

Overall, I'm so impressed by this restaurant, and in particular,  the staff and the food. We had an excellent server, Moni, who was very attentive and provided great service!! I will definitely be dining again and would highly recommend this place! This is some of the best Greek food I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"wow, this was an amazing restaurant.  I am uber picky and live in NYC.  I was in Toronto in order to find an Indian wedding dress... and we searched for restaurants .  OMG, our server, Ellen, was divine (a server should be an experience).  The food was SO good... not just good... and the DETAILS.  From every cup, plate, napkin in the bathroom.  

I will for sure come again...  you must check this place out if you can."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner with 4 co-workers. Seated promptly we ordered the prawn saganaki, thinking it was the flaming cheese dish. It wasn't, but it was very tasty and 4 shrimp to share.  

All of us really enjoyed our meals - moussaka, lamb in filo pastry and a seafood dish. The baklava and Greek yogurt desserts were also very good. 

Service was attentive and because we were there early it was nice and quiet. 
Would definitely consider this place for another visit."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have been for braised fall-off-the-bone lamb.  Excellent ambiance as well.  Alert and charming staff (Tim) who took the time to explain all of the items and make appropriate suggestions."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for Summerlicious since there were so many great reviews on Yelp. I made a reservation for 5:30 on a weekday. They were packed by 6! I checked in on Yelp to get the Saganaki however I had to remind my waitress since our apps came out. So we had to have it with our mains. 

We started with some bread which was nice and warm. For the apps I had the grilled octopus and my friend had the trio of dips. We had to ask for more bread at this point. Because the dips were just a bunch of dips. There was hummus and tzatziki which were really good but the smoked salmon dip was mediocre for me. The grilled octopus was good. It wasn't chewy and had good flavour. 

I had the Lobster Kritharoto for my main, and my friend had the lamb shank. The lobster Kritharoto was good but did not exceed my expectations. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious but it didn't wow me like I expected. My friends lamb shank was fall off the bone and he said it was good but again, didn't exceed expectations based on reviews. 

Our desserts were amazing. Definitely best baklava and chocolate mousse I've ever had. The mousse was more dense than expected and didn't taste too sweet. We both enjoyed our desserts. 

Overall it was a solid 4. I think I would have given this a 4.5-5 stars if the service was better. It was good but the forgotten saganaki and the fact that our waitress didn't check up on our empty wine glasses when it was busy, it was a little disappointing. But overall, still a good experience."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! The decor is very cozy and inviting (especially after trekking through the freezing cold). My coworkers and I were sat at a large long table in the middle of the restaurant. We had the flaming cheese to start, which was so delicious and the presentation is pretty cool. This place is big on seafood, so we all tried a different variation. I had the halibut, which was tasty and flaky, and came with vegetables that had been cooked in lemon vinaigrette and paired well with the fish. My coworkers really like the exohico and the seafood kleftiko. Definitely recommend the Santorini white wine. Our waitress was also lovely. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant represents Greek food at its finest.
Dined here last week and was immediately impressed with the ambience.
It was spacious but at the same time, had a cozy atmosphere. I could see the open kitchen from afar.
For starters, I ordered the Saganaki, which was a Sheep's milk cheese prepared with lemon and Brandy and then lit in the pan as it was about to be served. It was simply to die for.
For main, I ordered the Seafood Kleftiko which was a medley of seafood wrapped in a phyllo pastry with leeks, feta cheese and spinach served with a Dill Beurre Blanc. It came with a side of coleslaw. It resembled more of a sandwich but was extremely tasty and filling. I devoured every bite and enjoyed my very delicious meal."}
{"text":"Exceptional food, good service even though we were a large group. Will go here again."}
{"text":"Great choice for summerlicious, love their octopus appetizer, Lamb Shank is well cooked, and the portion is generous.:)"}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal. Had the calamari, & the seafood pie. Plenty of great wine with a fantastic atmosphere. Our server was very well informed on the wine list and menu pairings and extremely attentive. Everyone at our table enjoyed their dishes, right down to the dessert.

Will definitely go back when I'm in Toronto next."}
{"text":"Our server, David, made the entire experience worth a 5-star rating! He was very charming and funny, and attentive to our needs. Came here for Summerlicious lunch with a few coworkers, and the food was absolutely delicious. Everything was cooked beautifully, and like David recommended, we all got the chocolate mousse for dessert and it was as delicious as he said it to be. Very classy atmosphere, and was an excellent lunch experience."}
{"text":"Best lamb shank I've had! Can't go wrong with huge pieces of tender meat that melts in your mouth and fills up your stomach! 

It's a really nice environment, pretty upscale, and you definitely won't get away with sweats or hoodie. Everyone is dressed up, in suits and dresses. Love the elegant decor, did not expect it from the outside.

Service is a bit on the slower side.

The flaming cheese looks cool, I NEED to try it next time when Im here!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here few times since it opened and always found it pretty good until my last visit. Wow what a difference food was way below expectations. Shared 5 times and everything but one was good. Service was pretty bad as well. Clearly our waiter didn't want to be there. He's attitude Kind of reminded me of the old school waiters you find on the danforth."}
{"text":"Located where it is , i didn't expect to enjoy Volos. I went in for a dinner meeting, and wasn't thinking much about the dining experience. 

Instead i found it hard to focus with such good flavours, such good services and such a nice ambience. They even feature the up and coming Tabl'eau water which i was pleasantly surprised by. 

I have to say, i haven't had seafood and octopus cooked so perfectly in a while - and Byblos did a great job. It's definitely a restaurant i can see myself regular at in the future."}
{"text":"We were here for Summerlicious Lunch and had the dolmades for appetizer, my friend had the lemon chicken and I had the seafood salad for main, and for dessert we both had the baklava.  It was our first time trying dolmades and while they were good, it was a bit too sour for our taste so we couldn't finish it.  When our waiter (who was awesome by the way) asked why we had so much left over, we explained why and he went back to ask the manager and comped us for the appetizer! It was so nice of him even though that wasn't our intention.  My friend had the chicken and it was a huge portion, and the chicken was very moist and flavorful. I'm going to have to try that when I come back next time!  I had the seafood salad with squid, octopus, calamari and shrimp, it was refreshing and light but very filling.  We then both had the baklava, I was expecting it to be very sweet, but it wasn't, just enough sweetness and the topping was nice an crunchy.
Service was excellent too, our waiter came by every so often to top up our waters and asked how our other dishes were."}
{"text":"Great Greek restaurant that I would highly recommend if you can afford the dishes.  I started with the fennel salad which was very good...the cheese was perfect.  My main course was sesame crusted salmon which was very nice but the star of the plate was the veggies which had beautiful flavours."}
{"text":"Great evening.  Walking distance to the Fairmont and my Greek fix is satisfied.  Super food. Great atmosphere.  Enjoyed talking to Andreas the owner and Jenna behind the bar was a real treat.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant few times and extremely happy with service and food. Highly recommend saganaki and seafood."}
{"text":"VIBE 
I came back here with a few friends because it had been a while and we were going to Yuk Yuk's down the street. So it was the perfect after-work dine and indulge session. 

This time, I got to meet Andreas, who is a lovely host. He suggested our group sample the appetizers since the mains are a bit heavy. Good choice! Our waitress was great as well. 

WE ATE/DRANK
No Mythos here but we had Alpha instead which was light and refreshing (and new to me, anyways). We had a vegetarian in our group and she loved the options on the menu.  So let's get started: 

Bread - it was a really light olive bread and paired with olive oil was delicious. We finished the basket! 

Fried Zucchini Tower - I found myself eating this appetizer the most. It went perfectly with the tzatziki and wasn't as fried as I thought it would be. 

Horiatiki Salad or village salad - the traditional greek salad. It was super fresh and the feta was soft and creamy. A great app to share. 

Grilled Calamari - this was split into three medium to large sections of fish so three of us each got one. I think I would have liked more capers but this one was fresh. 

Smyrna style meatballs - these got gobbled up quickly! Perfect for dipping bread. 
 
Wild arugula and shaved fennel salad - it was a nice salad but probably my least favourite because I could make this at home and I don't feel like it's worth $12 for an arugula appetizer. 

Then there was dessert. The desserts here are fantastic! 

The traditional baklava is a hefty size and as sweet as it should be. Sinful and Greek. Perfect for two. 

Fresh Cantaloupe ice cream - it was fresh and light. But definitely not worth $9. 

Ouzo Chocolate Mousse - Wow. Again, the desserts should be priced at about $7 for their worth, not $9. That said, I'd get this again. It was delicious! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
We were definitely VOLO (s) (read: full for those who don't understand puns). Warm, friendly service; comfortable settings and great food to share. That's what it's all about! I'll be back."}
{"text":"I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance and I was so excited for the food every single day leading up to my reservation and I had every right to be excited. This dinner could not have gone any better, straight from the service to the ambience and the food. Our server was so lovely and friendly, making sure we had everything we needed and wanted. 

HERE IS WHAT WE ORDERED:
Saganaki: Not only is the presentation spectacular, the cheese is delicious as well. Not too salty, and pairs well with the bread basket. 

Seafood Krithoroto: Wow... can the seafood here get any better? There's a good balance of seafood to orzo, so you're sure to get a good mix of seafood and orzo in every bite. The calamari is so soft and tender, salmon is flaky and melts in your mouth, and the prawns and mussels are cooked to perfection. 

Lamb Shank: Probably one of the best lamb dishes i've ever had - the lamb is so tender and juicy, falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. The flavours aren't too over powerful and they do provide a good balance of sides to complement the lamb which is really the star of the dish. 

Braised Greens: You really do get a lot of greens (asparagus and swiss chard) for $7. It's a great addition especially if your dish is seafood and pasta heavy. 

Chocolate Mousse: The mousse was so chocolately rich and velvety but very light at the same time. Even if you're super full from dinner, it's light enough to add on and complete your meal. 

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a place in the financial district. The portions are huge and well prepared, making them a bargain for the price. (Might even be better than some restaurants in greek town and that's saying a lot...)"}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Best meal we had during a short visit to Toronto.  We had the Greek salad, grilled octopus app, prawn app, and the scallops entree.  Wow, everything was so fresh and perfectly cooked.  If you're in a hurry, you may not want to come here during peak hours. It did take a bit of time to order and get our meals, but an incredible meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing service!! Our server adi was the best!
The drinks were incredible-- try the Greek gimlet!
Food was delicious and hot and fresh, even during restaurant week (which generally dissapoints, but not Volos!)
Loved it, will def be back and recommend!"}
{"text":"We had come here many years ago for a special occasion where we had a great time so we suggested since it was nearby for our friend's special occasion and it was still great! Service from beginning to end was great attentive. I was surprised that they actually had a high chair for the kid. We ordered the vegetarian pasta which was decent. For dessert we tried the chocolate mousse and the flourless chocolate cake. Both were excellent but the winner was the cake. Great time!"}
{"text":"After reading everyone else's reviews, I feel sad that I only had a 3.5 star experience! 

My boyfriend chose this restaurant for our anniversary, and even checked it out on Yelp first (I'm so proud!). And it COULD be a five star place, but there were a few things that prevented me from giving it that rating!

First of all, I love the ambiance of the place. Perfect for a special occassion. Also, the service was amazing. The hostess was so friendly, and wished me a happy anniversary *aw* she told our server as well, who was very friendly and recommended tons of good food, as well as told us the history of the restaurant. 

So, now for why this is a three star review - it comes down to the food. My food really was just mediocre! To start, I had the zuchini tower, which was fried in tempura-type batter. At first it was delicious, but after a few slices, and especially when it started to cool down, it became sort of greasy and unappealing. If you go for this app, I'd definitely split it. For my main, I had the giant grilled shrimp with quinoa (which had rasins in it! Bleh! Put a warning on your menu!) but really, it was just ok. The shrimp were kind of bland (could have used some seasoning) and the quinoa was nothing special. I did have the delicious greek yogurt dessert though - it was absolutely devine. 

I'm definitely going to check this place out again (expect an update) because I can't believe that everyone else had a way better experience than me!! I would definitely recommend checking this place out either way - it's definitely a great spot for a date, AND I'm convinced the food must be amazing (the chef must have been having an off night)."}
{"text":"One day in Toronto, must set up a business dinner location.  What to do, what to do.  

I wanted to find a place that was classy, quiet, suitable for business, but also not too stuffy and overly impressed with itself.  I wanted food that was interesting but had safe choices for possibly unadventurous diners.  I wanted a place that took reservations!  And with one day only in Toronto, I wanted to treat myself to a nice dinner experience.

Estiatorio Volos definitely hit all the criteria.  The ambience can be romantic, but it was also muted and classy for a business dinner.  There was a lot of activity and atmosphere, but it was quiet enough to allow for conversation.  

Food was excellent.  We started with a bottle of wine (my colleague chose, so I'm not sure which wine we had, but it was a good one - ha) and, upon the server's recommendation, the octopus appetizer.  Oh my goodness.  Please order this dish.  SUCH a beautifully seasoned and cooked dish.  The octopus was tender and flavorful, the balsamic glaze was perfect and the small salad on the side had some acidity too.  So wonderful.

Entrees were the Wild Salmon and she had the Scallops.  Delicious.  Then we had the baklava dessert.  Also very good.

The service was very good - perfect timing with everything, and very pleasantly helpful throughout the evening.  

I really couldn't have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday. I was very very disappointed. We got two starters (grilled calamari and baby arugula and shaved fennel salad) and two meals (seafood  kritharoto and VOLOS Farfalle Pasta). The waiter did not even check up on our food, our water glasses were empty, I had to wave him over and ask for water. When he picked up our empty dishes he asked how everything was. I was shocked as this is a fancy place and we got such horrible service. He then walked over and put the bill on the table. I had not requested it, I think he just wanted us to leave. 

The food was average, the service was horrible. I definitely wont go back to this place"}
{"text":"Best Greek food I have had in Toronto. 

This is a really great place for a romantic date night. The dim-lit lights, flickering candles, soft-set jazz, and black elegant furnishing: so comfortable, intimate and cozy. 

I highly recommend the following: Seafood Kritharoto with salmon, tiger prawns, calamari, mussels, kefalotyri and orzo. Orecchiette with wild greens, cherry tomatoes, roasted peppers, goast cheese and garlic. 
The orecchiette was such a great take on a Greek classic and the Kritharoto just melts in your mouth with so much goodness. 

Thanks to a Yelp promo, we also got the saganaki for free! Started to feel a little pyro there. Excellent food with great complimentary bread. By the time we were done with the saganaki I already felt full. The entrees were equally filling but so delicious that you really just want to savour every single bite. 

There was a bit of an inebriated mishap at the table next to mine, resulting in a lady falling down the stairs and another vomiting all over the washroom. I had the misfortune of walking into the vomit volcano in the washroom. 

However, the manager was an absolute darling and decided to foot my $70 bill because of the vomit mess, though it was completely unnecessary. 

I am definitely coming back soon with more friends."}
{"text":"What else can I say? Reserving online was painless ( I reserved literally last minute because Boil on King Street cancelled my reservation without notice), the restaurant itself has a chic modern decor, the food (seafood and Greek) were cooked to perfection (the best grilled Calamari I ever had in my life) A great wine list with some spectacular wines from Greece, and last but not least amazing servers (And here is where I have to give a shout out to Brett, who is one of the BEST Servers in the 6ix) If you are craving fresg seafood or Authentic Greek cuisine, you will find it here. One the best dining experiences I ever had from start to finish :). Thanks again Brett for your amazing and attentive service :) If this guy ran for Premier he would have my vote. People want what they pay for and Estiatoro Volos delivered on this :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really nice here. Romantic, trendy. Service was great start to finish. Really attentive, great recommendations. What fell flat was the food. Had the octopus for a starter which was horribly overcooked. It's not easy to cook it well and they didn't. Saganaki was OK; nothing special. 

The mains were fantastic. Took our waiters recommendation and had the rack of lamb with pistachio crust. Cooked medium rare, it was tender and delicious. My husband had the Exohico pie (lamb in phyllo) and he also raved about it. Portions were small though and for $46 and $23 respectively we would expect more.

Overall stick with the mains and enjoy. Perhaps other dishes are better, but given how pricey it is I won't chance it again."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this restaurant today with a friend.  This restaurant was formerly named Mediterra but has been rebranded and refurbished inside such that it is much more elegant than before but still had the charm of the open kitchen.  The menu is far more interesting than before and the food presentation is also much better.  The owner, Andreas, came to our table to welcome us which was nice.  His wait staff was very knowledgeable and attentive.  All of that was great - but the standout was the food.  

We shared the Tiger Shrimp Saganaki.  It came with four large tiger shrimp in a fresh broth and without the typical firely cheese saganaki presentation.  It was light and delicious.  

We each ordered the warm seafood salad which comes with some arugula on top of warm quinoa surrounded by a piece of warm grilled salmon and a piece of halibut, as well as a large scallop and a large tiger shrimp.  It doesn't sound like a lot but it was very filling (healthy and delicious too).  I am not a big quinoa fan and I usually find it to be tough and tasteless but it was very flavourful.  I ate every last bite.  

The waiter recommended the Santorini wine which was a perfect accompaniment to our seafood feast.  

I was going to avoid dessert but as soon as our watier said the words \"dark chocolate mousse\" it was over for me.  It came in a martini glass and was just the right amount - topped with fresh cream and berries - I wish I could have licked the glass clean.  It was very light and the perfect end to a very enjoyable lunch.  

The only thing I would say is that the prices should really put the put the price range to $$$ instead of $$.  

I will be back."}
{"text":"As you enter this beautifully  and sophisticated looking restaurant, you begin to easily realize  why people have such  amazing reviews  about it!! Not only is it beautiful  at first sight, but the People that work there are so welcoming, so humble, and so proud to work there, as u sit down you too will find out why that is, and your taste buds, don't know what they're in for. Everything  that we ordered, from our Saganaki- fried cheese appetizer, to our martinis. To the olive oil that is placed on each table. Every mouthful  is a piece of Greek god Heaven. My Lamb shank was Amazing, and served  with the most deliciouse Feta cheese Mashed  potatoes,  and my partner had the Moussakka  which was To die for!!!!! The dark chocolate mousse  was deliciouse and the fresh whip cream with a splash of ouzo  gave it a nice Greek twist ;)  OPA!!!!"}
{"text":"(3.5 star) A Greek restaurant outside of the Danforth? Sure, why not. 

I took a VIP client for a holiday luncheon here. The place was hopping at 1pm on a Wednesday. Interior is quite spacious with lots of seating. Decor seemed very functionary - I would say great spot for business lunches, but not so good for a romantic dinner date.

The wine list is not too big, but I was pleased to see it consisted of mostly Greek wines (hard to find these in Canada!) Having recently traveled around Greece, we immediately spotted a wine on the menu from a winery we actually visited in Santorini. 

The lunch menu consisted of about 10 appetizers ($10-$14 range) and maybe 10 mains ($18-$30). Thank God they did not have souvlaki on the menu, but they did have some of the regular boring options (moussaka, sigh)

I tend to gravitate towards seafood, so we ordered the grilled kalamari appetizer to share, and a seafood salad and the sea scallops for our mains.

The food was all absolutely delicious. Kalamari was perfectly grilled (not overcooked), served with tomatoes and capers and a balsamic reduction. DC's seafood salad looked beautiful. My sea scallops were served with melizanosalata (grilled eggplant dip, similar to baba ganouj) and sauteed wild mushrooms. Superb! 

The service was a bit over the top. There was someone standing at the table every 90 seconds, removing plates, setting cutlery, asking how our meal was, etc etc. It was quite disruptive of our conversation and I kind of wish they would have backed off! Plus, our waitress was Asian. I wanted a Greek Dimitris! 

Although food was completely 5 star, I thought the pricing on the lunch menu was quite exorbitant  - 1 appetizer, 2 mains and 2 glasses of wine coming in at $120. Fine for dinner, but for lunch? Ahem.

If you are looking for a fine dining experience and really great food, you will love Volos. If you are looking for a more traditional Greek dining experience, find an ouzeri or taverna on the Danforth with real Greek waitstaff and more rustic fare (Pantheon, Mezes, Athens Restaurant)."}
{"text":"The short version: 
Tasteful drinks, good looking food, elegant service, delicious ambiance, scrumptious people....I might have mixed up the adjectives for the nouns, but no matter how you unscramble this, you can't go wrong here. No wonder all the suits hang out here.

______

The long version:
How befitting that my 300th review is for Volos--I'm glad it's a five-star review. Admittedly, I came here with a Yelp group, but any restaurant owner who takes as much care as Andreas does of his restaurant deserves a five-star.

As soon as I walked in, the \"tall handsome man\" in a crisp white shirt welcomed me and seated me at the bar with the rest of my group. At this point, I had no idea he was an owner. When we were ready to be seated at  our table, he personally took us to the table and pulled the chair for me--I still thought he was the host at the front. It wasn't until half way through the meal was I told that the tall handsome man was a captain of the ship. During the meal, I noticed him in and out of the kitchen, around the restaurant talking to various tables, introducing and discussing the wine list, menu, and his restaurant philosophy, and talking to the servers. How can a restaurant not be \"as good as it gets\" when you have someone like him to ensure every aspect of his restaurant is up to standard?

The menu, as Andreas explained to us, is primarily Greek food with a modern twist and they try to introduce as much traditional Greek style seafood as they can, as Greece is a nation surrounded by seas. Since it is still quite a baby in the restaurant scene in Toronto, the restaurant is still experimenting with available local, fresh ingredient and the menu can still change. It does help though that this restaurant comes from a family that have been in the business for years, so not much can go wrong. I love the fact that I'm seeing all types of Greek food that I have never seen from the Danforth.

Our group ordered some appetizers and I tried the zucchini tower, which was a lot like tempura zucchinis, but more flavourful, and came with a garlic tzatziki on the side. Delicious. It was, however, not stacked like a tower. For entree, I ordered a moussaka, an eggplant based dish with a spiced beef filling, reminiscent of lasagna, that our server highly recommended. Unfortunately I have never had a moussaka before so I can't make a fair comparison, but I was told by others that it was one of the best ones they've had. I thought it was good and quite heavy, and definitely regretted that I couldn't finish it.  For dessert, I had a taste of the saffron ice cream. Very saffron heavy and most aromatic dessert I've ever had. 

Volos is also nicely stacked with all types of liquor and wine, as well as original and distinctive cocktails. I started with a a cocktail called Eros Passion, then a shot of greek (?) liquor, and was paired a sweet and smooth sauvignon blanc with my meal, again recommended by our server.

Speaking of our server, he was extremely knowledgeable w/ regard to all the dishes and all the wine on the list. Though not Greek, he has been drilled with everything you need to know as a server. Personable, charming, and informed--characteristics you generally wouldn't expect from an attractive guy--Andreas certainly knows how to cast them.  In fact, a look around the restaurant and you'll find that all the servers on the floor look like models--where was I again?. 

At approximately $20-$30 per entree, it's not unaffordable, and make for a perfect date night restaurant, or a night out after a hard day's work.  I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a Friday night dinner. It is an upscale Greek restaurant with a posh but comfortable vibe. 

Saganaki, $14. Unique presentation (flaming), but much too salty - I found myself having to constantly drink water throughout the night  

Grilled Moroccan Octopus, $19. Enjoyed this, never had octopus with this texture (entirely non-rubbery). It was served with a Walnut Eggplant Mousse which complimented the dish well.

Seared Cape Cod Scallops, $33. Fresh, large scallop medallions that were cooked perfectly. 

Moussaka, $24. Resembled a fancy and expensive lasagna, was not memorable. 

Lemon Roasted Potatoes, $7. A solid side dish.

Not a bad dinner spot but nothing particularly note-worthy."}
{"text":"Great place, very good food, and friendly staff, I highly recommend this place, the grilled Octopus is a must to try."}
{"text":"I highly recommend getting the shrimp appetizers and the octopus. The staff was friendly and the service was very fast. Great little spot with a trendy atmosphere. The prices are reasonable and I will be coming back next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"went for dinner at valentines day with my husband, service was excellent, food was delicious, atmosphere was gr8 :)"}
{"text":"Tried out their winterlicious menu. Highlight were the apps, octopus &a prawns. Both were great, the octopus being my favourite. I'm not personally a huge lamb fan but I gave the lamb shank a try based on a friends recommendation... turns out I really don't like lamb. For desert, I had the baklava which had the perfect amount of sweetness for a pastry desert . 

I'll come back to try another main next time. 

Our server was awesome. He helped us decide at the beginning of the night and was helping clear the tables for our next course. Surprisingly, he never came around to ask how the food was, we were left to enjoy and be on our own. It was quite nice."}
{"text":"Octopus app was great. Cornish hen dish was great. Left satisfied. Service was fine. I would return."}
{"text":"These guys are FANTASTIC! This review is specific to large groups (which they happily accommodate). We were celebrating a dual birthday of my mom and aunt and we were eight in total. They gave us their \"celebration table\" which is this huge table in the center of the dining room. The first thing we ordered were the saganakis. They have a traditional one, a tiger prawn one, and a lobster one. All were fabulous! The traditional one is the one with the most fanfare (flambeed and all) and its great fun in large groups. 

The entrees were delicious! The rack of lamb with pistachios is brilliant. Very juicy, flavorful, and the tangy side potatoes make for perfect accompaniment. The lamb exohico is also excellent. Layered, baked, and crisped to perfection. The meat is not dry as well. Google exohico and volos shows up, its that good! The cornish hen stuffed with figs is a delight. You do full justice to this dish if you bite into all the layers at once. People also got the moussaka and salmon and they loved it (can't describe it since I didn't pick from their plates!).

The desserts were good, not great (lost half a star there, sadly). I expected more traditional ones (like galaktoboureko and rizolago) so that was a bit disappointing. But, here is where the great service kicks in. They got us not one, but two complimentary desserts with candles and all for the birthday women! That was quite a nice touch. The baklava is quite yummy. The chocolate mousse and chocolate flourless cakes are quite good.

Overall: great food, great experience, excellent for groups, amazing service."}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful, trendy, but not too fussy room, excellent service. 
We are used to eating Greek on the Danforth, but wanted something a bit classier, and this place was really nice. Lots of business people, and some trendier looking groups, but our family felt very welcome and comfortable. Menu is different then Danforth places, portions smaller, but the food was carefully prepared and delicious. Service was attentive and unobtrusive. Prices were high but for a nice evening out (or pre-opera/theatre) this is a great choice. Parking was underground and around the corner for us, but this is Downtown!
Convenient to many hotels as well. Delicious and well mixed cocktails!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our Wedding Anniversary here and we absolutely loved the food, music and service! 

We tried the Saganaki, and grilled Octopus based on other reviews that we read and for the mains we had the Lamb shank and the Cornish hen.

The lamb shank was so tender and the Cornish hen was so juicy! 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent upscale Greek food, but I think more importantly, unimpeachable treatment of seafood for any of you voracious for all things under the sea.  A friend hosted his birthday dinner here and the experience was great.

Appetizers: Saganaki had a satisfying chewy taste, the dolmades were delicious, but the calamari and octopus were out of sight.  We also had the deep-fried zucchini, which was fine but didn't measure up to the other starters.

Entrees: I ordered the mixed seafood orzo, and it was delicious.  Well-seasoned, with melt-in-mouth scallops and pieces of fish, mussels, and prawns.  

I tried some friend's moussaka, which was as elegant and rich as other reviewers described.  

I also tried a friend's fish of the day--sea bass--and it was incredible!  Perfectly seasoned with a delicious crust that kept moist and flavorful the meat of the fish, this dish truly illustrates just how good EV is at seafood.

Ambience, service--it's all there.  Go for the moussaka and gooooooo for the seafood."}
{"text":"Amazing. Greek in fashionable way. All taste very good and wine selection are nice too."}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant  due to it proximity to the Canadian Opera Company and we were not disappointed. Had an early reservation which allowed for full attention from the waitress. 

Had a very nice greek red wine as suggested and this complimented our Saganaki and grilled calamari both of which were fantastic. Rack of lamb was delicious (often use this to decide what a restaurant is like and this did not disappoint). Seafood stew and veal dish was also excellent. Deserts were very nice (I have had better baklava). Overall a very nice evening before a evening at the opera."}
{"text":"Until Volos Estiatorio, Richmond and York was a pretty sad intersection. There are the rear ends of the Four Seasons Centre and Sheraton Hotel and Little Anthony's, a mostly tourist-oriented Italian spot. The arrival of this new Greek resto, however, will have you smashing their plates with glee. (Please don't actually do this.)

Though I was shamefully underdressed [1] and reservationless to boot, our hostess was kind enough to seat us at the bar while they prepared our table. In the meantime we helped ourselves to some Greek drinks. The cocktail and wine menu takes care to feature Greek spirits and vintages. I am ignorant about Greek wine (I thought only Satyrs drank the stuff), so I ordered a gin cocktail called Eros' Passion, and it was good. Erotically so.

As we sat at the bar a Very Handsome Man (I assume the owner) came over and told us a bit about the the restaurant. Volos is a port city in Greece and Estiatorio means \"restaurant that leans more to the upscale.\" The VHM explained their aim of serving Greek food in a dignified way (read: no souvlaki on a bun) while also offering contemporary dishes that allow them to feature local meats and fish.

We started with the Kefalotyri Cheese Saganaki ($11), which was brought to our table and promptly set on fire with brandy. The sheep's milk was soft and creamy, and a bit tart too. Great on olive bread. I liked it a lot. My DC got the moussaka ($19), which I didn't try since I don't eat eggplant, but it got a thumbs up. I ordered the Exohico ($22) which is lamb, spices and vegetables wrapped in phyllo pastry. There is a bit of a story with this one... so sit back weary travelers, and sup at the generous teat of Grecian-food-intake-related tale-telling:

In short: when it was served there was a hole in the side. The waiter told me it was \"banged up a bit\" on delivery but from my eyes it looked edible. They offered to make me another one, but as someone not prone to waste (and let's face it, I'm impatient), I took the damaged portion and they were kind enough to take it off my bill.

But if the kind gesture didn't leave a great taste in my mouth, the exohico certainly did. So full of flavour and the feta and kefalotyri cheese were seriously drool-inducing. And what isn't better wrapped in phyllo? What? What! I ask you?

We shared two scoops of Greek yogurt for dessert. Be warned, it's very tart and way more filling than it looks, but if you spare the room in your stomach it's worth ordering.

All in all I had an excellent experience there. I think it's a perfect spot for theatre-goers or visitors to the nearby hotels. That is to say: please skip The Keg.

Obligatory Title Pun: They aren't friVOLOus about Greek cuisine.

Menu Readability: The same words a woman uses to describe her ideal wedding: elegant, classic, tasteful.

Need to mention: My date mentioned the VHM no less than five times. I'm not joking.

What this place teaches me about myself: It could be equal parts bleach and bongwater -- if it's called Eros' Passion I'm slurping it up.

{"text":"Great upscale Greek restaurant, perfect for a nice sit down lunch. You must try the saganaki: kefalotiri cheese flamb√© with ouzo and spritzed with fresh lemon juice. 
The seared scallops on a bed of black lentils and quinoa was pretty decent, but nothing to rave about. Nice and light option for lunch."}
{"text":"I ordered the braised lamb shank and my friend had the exohico (with a substitute). We checked in on Yelp and got a free saganaki (flaming cheese), which was a nice starter. 

The lamb was amazing, tender and came right off the bone! The mashed potato with spinach below it was kind of cold, as if it was left out for 10 minutes before being served. I really want to try the octopus next time!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Volos last night, at the recommendation of our hotel concierge (must stop listening to him). 

Ambiance is great, the restaurant is beautiful, and open. 

Service is terrible. I had to flag down our waitress for everything and she was less than pleasant and completely unapologetic.

Food is just okay:
-- Meatball appetizer - my husband and daughter agreed these were terrible. They left most of this dish.
-- Grilled calamari was a bit bland, definitely don't recommend this dish.
-- Gigantes was delicious! Finally a good dish.
-- Horiatiki salad with added salmon. The salmon came with sesame seeds, despite my request to NOT have the seeds. So we sent the salmon back and just ate the salad. The tomatoes were mushy and there were far too many of them as compared to the cucumbers and peppers. I've had far better salads at half the cost.
-- Bread basket was FANTASTIC. Not sure why but we couldn't stop eating this bread. Definitely the highlight of our evening.

Overall: I have no problem paying for good food and service. But when both are severely lacking there's obviously a problem. We definitely wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Great stuff and great service. Salmon portion was a bit small to give 5 stars. Will def go back!"}
{"text":"You've got a friend in VOLOS. 

The huge interior is white, airy and sweeps your mind away to Greece. This sort of pleasant atmosphere lends itself to tranquility, shared plates, and drinks with lunch... and there ain't nothing wrong with that. 

I have never had Greek wine before, so when the server recommended a glass of Greek sparkling ros√© I was hesitant, but quickly won over. What a crisp glass of bubbly! Beyond the wine, favourites include: flaming cheese, the unmatched-in-freshness Greek salad and the octopus. 

Opa!"}
{"text":"The ambience is very nice. For starters, try their Saganaki - milk cheese -; then the Grilled Calamari--ok it's squid. Then you must have the Soutzokakia: meatballs in tomato sauce wanting attention. I like Meheeecan food, so they say Exohico is as exotico as a Greek burrito."}
{"text":"This place has amazing octopus. That's absolutely an appetizer you should get. It's flavored differently than typical Greek octopus- it's called Moroccan octopus and has some spice rub on it or something. It's soft (not rubbery) and so delicious.

The moussaka is also just excellent.

It's a bit more expensive than a typical Greek restaurant, but also fancier and frankly has better service than a lot of other Greek restaurants that I've been to. And with food being as consistently tasty as it is, it's worth it.

You should go!"}
{"text":"I'm so sorry... I didn't have too great of an experience here like all the other reviewers. The food definitely was excellent. The service that day... not so much.

I booked a Winterlicious lunch for a Friday 11:45. The first time I called to book, I waited on the phone for SO long before somebody picked up. And when he did, I had to hold for another 10 minutes.

VOLOS is a beautiful restaurant. Hardwood floors, elegant lighting and decorations, the chairs and tables are dark wood, and we sat deep into the restaurant where the kitchen was just a glass window away. It was nice watching the chefs prepare our foods with so much attention to details.

Vibe: 5 stars.

Now we sat down and asked what we'd like to drink. We said water.
- Would you like sparkling water, iced water, or distilled water?
- Distilled is fine.
- Okay, you'll like this. It's from Greece.

So our water came in a very nice glass bottle. Apparently from Greece? Turns out on our bill, water was $12!!!!! Seriously????

The Winterlicious lunch ($20) was great. The Grilled Moroccan Octopus turned out to be lots of pieces of a giant octopus tentacle, it was very very soft and the tomato sauce was nice. The Vegetarian Orzo is also extremely amazing and definitely filling. I loved how they made orzo here (even in the Avgolemono Soup).

The food deserves 5 stars.

Our waitress was a little snobby-looking. She had very few smiles, she also seemed disinterested because we were not ordering from their main menu. Also the $12 water is definitely super unfair (and unexpected). We were in a hurry (coworkers and I had to run back to the office to work -long day) so we didn't bother."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Greek food we have ever had, including the times we've spent in Greece! We had the flaming saganaki which was unbelievably delicious and moreish. The grilled octopus was delicate and perfectly accompanied. And moussaka - oh my, the moussaka was absolutely incredible!
Service was outstanding, wine was fantastic."}
{"text":"Nice ambience although a bit noisy if you are looking for a quite romantic dinner. Exquisite sea food - the sea bass & giant scallops were delicious, super fresh & flavorful. A nice selection of Greek & international wines.  Courteous & attentive staff. Desserts .....were  average- pressed yoghurt was paired with honey, figs & berries which made it an interesting fusion if tastes  & chocolate mousse was ok.

Will definitely come here again to check out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Three of us were trying out Estiatorio Volos all for the first time. I had read so many glowing reviews and glad to say I wasn't disappointed! I had made res  but came early anyway so we ordered drinks at the bar first. There's also a complimentary coatcheck which is nice when it gets to be winter and you have a big burdensome jacket.

We ordered 4 appetizers : grilled calamari, scallops, salad, and the flaming cheese.
The calamari and scallops were cooked perfectly - so tender! There were three pieces of each, which was great since we had three people. The flaming cheese was great when it was first brought out. I recommend digging into it right away instead of letting it cool off and turn into a solid brick like we did. 

For mains, I had the pacific salmon and the two guys got the lamb shank. I'm usually really wary about ordering salmon just cuz I've had so many overcooked and dry salmon dishes served to me in restos. I went for it anyway; just asked the server if they could cook it a medium and he said no problems! 

My salmon was juicy and it's served w skin on just fyi for those who don't like fish skin. I love it (and would've loved it even more if it was served crispy skin side up *yum*).  The guys were happy with their fall-off-the-bone lamb shanks and mashed potatoes. Good portion sizes ... were all too full for dessert though I would've wanted to try the baklava!!

Pretty solid 4-stars from me. I'd definitely come here again for a nice meal."}
