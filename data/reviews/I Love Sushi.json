{"text":"Definitely my fave sushi restaurant in Henderson.  Ambiance is relaxed and friendly, service is efficient, price range is reasonable, sushi is delicious."}
{"text":"Johnny roll, Kiss of Fire, Sun devil, Garlic Butter Special, and Yellowtail nagiri are amazing! See Randy if you sit at the bar he is awesome."}
{"text":"Service used to be incredibly slooooooow...we stopped going since we cant afford two hours dinners. But improved since. My  favorite neighborhood sushi restaurant, its my daughter & I's special place where we get to spend some quality time over food we both enjoy most! She's ten, her favorite is California Roll, Deep Fried Gyoza, Edamame and mine are Salmon Skin Roll, Agedashi Tofu, Cucumber Salad and we both love the Spider Roll (soft shell crab). And she also loves the Japanese Sprite which was introduced to her since Osaka Restaurant's days. For a good sushi in henderson, this is Z place..."}
{"text":"We have eaten at I Love Sushi several times over the last four years. They are amazing! The screaming orgasm is the best. Over the weekend it is better to make a reservation if you don't want to wait for a table. They are not cheap but the food is well worth the money! James, the owner, is fun and works hard to make this place the best to have sushi in town. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My sister and I had a great lunch today. Miso soup, two big Japanese beers and two specialty rolls. Great service too."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for sushi last night. Had the Candy roll, jackpot roll, and crunch roll and all were yummy.  Loved the ambience with kimonos and Japanese music. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Usually order the same dishes. Their Spicy Edamame is yum! The Springmountain Roll is a must try...it has just enough spice and has no rice. The Spicy Sashimi Salad I think it's called. The Large comes with choice of 3 different kinds of fish on top of Daikon (Winter Radish) with a spicy ponzu sauce. Amazing! The Grand Canyon Roll is a roll I order for my 5 year old niece. No raw fish in the roll. It's a California Roll topped with saut√©ed mushrooms, shrimp, and scallops in a creamy sauce. She also loves their Krab Hand Roll.   The service is usually great. Definitely not one of the All You Can Eat joints in Vegas, but totally worth it if you're not trying to dine on a budget."}
{"text":"I award this the absolute best sushi, and service in the state of NEVADA... no competition. nicely priced for the portions of food served. Very clean, only request is that open more locations. :)"}
{"text":"Great sushi. We were recommended I love Sushi by chance. Met a couple at Egg Works (another great restaurant for breakfast). They told us about I Love Sushi and we tried it later that night.  Really fresh fish , which is as anyone knows is hard to come across in the desert. Service was quick and very attentive. Drinks never went empty and sushi chef couldn't wait to fix us something else.  Try it out if you are in the area. It's a bit pricey but worth the $$."}
{"text":"I  love sushi,  xcelente  sushi, my favorite Japanese lasagna. Double D' Great Place!!! Great service."}
{"text":"OHHHH EMMMM GEEEE !!!!!!!!!!!!! ahahahahaha I LOVE, I LOVE SUSHI!  and so do my family from Hawaii that come to visit.  I love sushi is a MUST when they're here.    The sushi chef's are a crack -up- very lively and funny, and the servers are very friendly and adorable!  Ask for Eun-soo, she's the best =]  My favorites: * taste like my ex-girlfriend * grand canyon * bok-bun-ja"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place! Loved everything about this place - especially their food and service! As soon as we were seated we were given warm towels to clean our hands with, which is a nice bonus you don't get at many sushi restaurants. Even though there were many customers at the restaurant and more kept coming in, I was surprised at how fast our food came out after we ordered. Hubby and I ordered the chicken teriyaki entree, and 2 rolls (Happy Ending and Alligator). Everything tasted so fresh and just right; the rolls are also a good portion.  I was also surprised at how spacious this restaurant was; from the outside it doesn't look very big, but this place can definitely accommodate large groups! Will definitely be coming back here :)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I think it is great. I Love Sushi has a wide assortment of rolls and fish. The quality is good and the menu is creative.   The truly great aspect of this restaurant is the attentive sushi bar staff and their relationship with customers. They are fast and like to chat with the patrons and suggest new things based on the types of sushi you like. We were sat at the sushi bar surrounded by regulars who knew the sushi chefs by name.   A satisfying meal of only rolls, sashimi, and nigiri was about $50 for 2 people. I was expecting it to be more in the $65 range considering the quality of the meal. I Love Sushi is a solid value for sushi enthusiasts.  http://www.merchantcircle.com/business/I.Love.Sushi.702-990-4055"}
{"text":"I eat here often and the food and service is always great.  My favorite rolls are the Jackpot and Ryan's Special.  I never have to wait to be seated even when it's real busy."}
{"text":"We live in Sun Anthem and I Love Sushi is our favorite sushi restaurant not because they are close to us but because of the quality of food they serve 7 days a week.  We have tried several other sushi restaurants in the area but we find that I Love Sushi seafood freshness, quality, service and pricing is unbeatable. We normally have all the sashimi selections but definitely try the \" kitchen sink\" without rice and request a little spicy Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for 5 years and though it is a little bit pricey for some things on the menu, you get what you pay for and what you pay for is the best Sushi and service in Nevada!  The staff is amazing and friendly- they know us by name and give my 5 year old hugs and high fives when we come in! I love the entire menu but if I had to eat one only one thing every day for the rest of my life it would be Salmon Lover no Rice! Best thing I have every eaten! (Close runner up is the scallop hand roll and salmon skin hand roll)  We look forward to our weekly visits and when we have actually ventured out to try other Sushi places we are always disappointed as nothing ever has come close in quality, service and atmosphere as I Love Sushi!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars  Maybe it was becuz I order take out? but not after reading similar reviews  The sushi I order was okay, except \"the I love sushi roll\", it was chopped of tomatoes and salmon chunks mixed in sum tangy sauce, not glazed over the sushi, but more like dumped on.  Visually not pleasing.  Rice with Beef Teriyaki was super dry. Same as the salmon teriyaki I got for my mother.  My brother order the Spicy Salmon Bowl, which was the same concept as \"i love sushi roll\" but the stuff was dumped over your lettuce.   I eat a lot of sushi, I don't think this place will make it in my rotation."}
{"text":"I could eat at I love Sushi every day of the week.  Seriously.  Everything I've tried has been fresh and so delicious.  My faves are the Double D roll, yellowtail/scallion roll, and the grilled salmon collar.  The sashimi salad and tuna tataki salad are also really good (and huge!).  The place is in a random shopping center with a dry cleaners and a Taco Bell, but don't let that throw you off.  This is one really great sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service is always consistently top notch. We have dined here consistently over the past 4 years and they always rock. Fast service, delicious flavors, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Everything is delicious and taste fresh. Very good prices and the quality is superb."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant. All the rolls are very well made and the salmon sushi is very generous. Always cut thick and not stringy with a bunch of connective tissue.   Weekends are easier to get a table then weekdays for some reason.  They have a full kitchen in case you go with someone who doesn't like sushi but I can't comment on the quality as I've never ordered off the regular menu.   As far as drinks goes if you're feeling adventurous, get a tall Kirin or Sapparro and mix it with Raspberry Wine. Makes for a nicely balanced drink that won't overpower the raw fish."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Fantastic service and food. We went about 7:30 on a Friday and told it would be about 15-20 minutes. It only took 10 min to get seated and they had 2 very large parties.  Our waitress was good, she had a great personality. Our food came out very quickly for how busy they were. My daughter (6 yrs old) liked it so much that she wants to go there for her birthday in couple months. No problem, we would happy to bring you here!  The downside, we have lived here almost a year and just discovered this place. ;) We will be back!! There is lots of stuff I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"I luv this place, the Wait staff is very friendly, the sushi is fresh and the nigori saki is cold and served in chilled saki glasses.   Yummy."}
{"text":"I come here al the time it is always fresh and delicious. It does get busy here so make sure you come early before it fills up on the weekends."}
{"text":"While this place was certainly great, there's just something about it that keeps it from being 5 stars. The food is delicious, the fish is fresh, and the service is fast and friendly. But there just isn't anything about this place that makes it \"a great deal\" or \"worth the high price.\" But the food, for the price, is just average. It's basically, exactly what you expect to get for the price you pay.  The options here are neverending. Seriously, the roll menu is HUGE. With so many different rolls, there's going to be something you like, no matter what your tastes are.  If you're a lover of fresh fish, definitely try the screaming orgasm, it is so yummy.   This place would be 5 stars if it was just slightly cheaper. While the fish is definitely good, I've also had a ton that's better quality for the same prices. And I guess that is I Love Sushi's fatal flaw: it has, ever so slightly, over-priced itself.  The prices are about average for a sushi place, but definitely not on the cheap side. If you're the kind of person who has sushi multiple times per week, you're better off finding a slightly less expensive place. For the occaisional sushi night, though, this place is perfect and you will leave happy."}
{"text":"It was amazing!  One roll that is a sleeper is the Last Call.  This what I would a nontraditional roll, but really good.  You have to save room for desert, tempura cheesecake, I could have the whole cake."}
{"text":"First off, our server came with our drinks and when my friend said we were ready to order (which our server didn't even ask) she gave us a dirty look like \"uh ok I guess.\" My friend ordered a California roll with crunch and eel sauce. Our server took her order and even asked her a second time what it was to be sure. My friends roll came out and it had no crunch or eel sauce on it... Also, our server was not friendly or very good. Never have had a super good experience here."}
{"text":"Still the best Sushi in Vegas, or Henderson. Fresh Fish, Creative Rolls.. Great Sushi Chefs..."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night for dinner, and by the time we were eating, it became very busy. -1 star for the service: it seemed like the servers were very overworked. Not once during our meal were we asked how things were. And good luck getting your water refilled during a rush. -1 star for the owner/manager screaming everywhere. At one point, bussers were clearing out an area of the bar and the owner yelled at them from across multiple tables to stop and clean a table instead....yelling right into my ear. I watched him yell across big distances multiple times, most of those times screaming right into customers' ears. While all customers are important, he was definitely focusing on getting all the parties waiting for tables seated and not at all focused on his customers already seated and trying to enjoy a meal.   The rolls themselves were very good, imo. But it seems like the majority of rolls offered are drenched in some kind of sauce, which makes it absolutely delicious. But as my friend pointed out, the quality of the fish could be bad and you would never know because all you taste is sauce."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend who lives nearby. We decided to check it out and i am glad we did The sushi was spectacular. Many different sushi rollls to pick from We ordered alot of different items and they where all all GREAT! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, costumer service is excellent. Every worker is very kind, and the atmosphere was so fun and cool."}
{"text":"We ate here based on a recommendation. Bad choice. The staff was very rushing it was overcrowded. The food was not very good either. If you like sushi that is  completely American inspired and fried then drenched in a mayonnaise based sauce you might actually enjoy this place. Almost every sushi roll has mayo. They mostly do sushi rolls. There fish is not fresh either. We will not be eating here again. Very disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"I Love Sushi *  I had the Spicy Salmon and Spicy Scallop  Simply Awful  Poor quality which resembles convenience store quality sushi Feels like they used Jasmine rice for the Maki roll based on the color and texture Sesame seeds were not integrated well into the rolls Spicy level was decent but not clear which sauce product they used.  Certainly was packaged and not made fresh in house Scallop & Salmon portion was and size of the roll was based on rice volume Would not order again For a high quality Maki roll, refer to Yuzu Sushi!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at this place their roles are very good, and fresh"}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place. Try the John Holmes Roll, the Who's Your Daddy Roll, and the I Love Sushi Roll and this will become your favorite as well."}
{"text":"I heard bout this place from my friend so I decided to make that 30-40 minute drive from my house to try I love sushi. When I first entered I was so impressed. I was greeted right away, and seated. There were so many servers. I was truly impressed. They had got towels on the table to wipe your hands which I have never seen before, loved it. I ordered the Monkey roll and the salmon roll it took them 5 minutes. I was so pleasantly surprised at how quickly it came. It was fresh and delish! Wow . I also ordered the Japanese lasagna to go! I was deff very happy and will be retuning soon!"}
{"text":"Yep, I've done a boat load of sushi places all over the States. This place will continue to hold a slot in the top three, easily. I don't care if it's in the desert! The sushi is fresh. The portions are generous. The staff is friendly and attentive. On top of that, you'll eat some rolls that you've never seen or heard of before, that have names right on key with Sin City style. You can keep your Nobu and your Roku. If you LOVE sushi, then you'll get this place. It's in the back of a strip mall, so watch for the little sign with the heart just past the Walgreen's. They do a killing on the weekends, so call in to make a reservation! If you're staying in LV, it's worth the drive to Henderson. Trust me. There is no all-you-can eat here. It's not that kind of fresh dead fish place. You'll get plenty full off a couple of rolls a lil cucumber salad and complimentary edamame. Don't forget to try the cold sake or the Korean soju (careful! Kick your butt that stuff!) Kampai!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of I Love Sushi for the past 10 years now. The sushi is really fresh and service has always been great. They have my vote for best sushi in town! Love this place!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. Ordered delivery while I was at work, worse experience of my life. I gave them one star because they did come on time. Whe to begin.... Well, first off, after placing the order the lady on the phone could not even tell me how much the total was. Her exact words were \"it's $113 or $130 not sure.\" Then hung up. The food was disgusting, everything had WAY too much sugar in it. The order was missing food. I called back telling them and to bring more spicey mayo and soy sauce since they didnt give us much to begin with. The lady tells us she will bring the food but there is an extra charge for the spicey mayo. This place also refused to give me the receipt for the order when I asked for it twice!!!   NEVER AGAIN Am I going anywhere near this place."}
{"text":"Je cherchais un bon restaurant √† Las Vegas. J'ai lu les critiques sur Yelp de ce resto. Je pensais avoir trouv√© un bon restaurant, aux prix de Montr√©al.   Mais non, c'√©tait pas le cas. On a command√© 6 sp√©cialit√©s du chef, et y'en a seulement une que j'ai aim√©, mais rien pour me jeter √† terre. Les makis √©taient trop 'mouill√©', trop 'juteux', l'exp√©rience en bouche √©tait vraiment pas agr√©able.   La qualit√© n'√©tait pas l√†, la pr√©sentation non plus, mais le go√ªt y √©tait - parfois. Pour moi, manger du sushi c'est une exp√©rience √† plusieurs sens, pas juste pour le go√ªt, mais aussi pour le visuel, la qualit√©, l'ambiance.   Et √† tous ces points de vue, j'ai vu mieux √† Montr√©al, beaucoup mieux."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for Sushi! Service is always great, food is always amazing! Some of the best Sushi in town!"}
{"text":"Went there on Sun, June 20 with 5 adults, 2 young kids and a baby-not a long wait, 15 minutes, very busy place, probably because it turns out the sushi was excellent. I was a little wary of  place with a name like this, but a relative who lives in the area swore by it. I cannot remember what we had but we went through about 9 rolls (all very well made by about 8 sushi guys behind the counter), also had a couple of other things like a nice lobster dish with mushrooms. Kids had teriyaki chicken, wife had tempura and teriyaki chicken entree. We will definitely go back next time in the area-we loved it. Fast service, attentive staff, great food, great prices!"}
{"text":"The best food I have ever eaten!!! We got the fat ass roll and the tastes like my ex girlfriend roll. Seriously, so good."}
{"text":"The best place in Henderson for sushi.  My parents live there and they've tried them all.  We always get a boat.  It's fresh, delicious and so much fun.  I LOVE SUSHI!"}
{"text":"Love love this place! Screaming O is the best in town! And also the bom boms special roll! A must have. The game tonight was awesome! Thank you for letting us hang out after we paid our check to watch the overtime!"}
{"text":"Funky name and even funkier (and funny!) names for rolls. They don't offer AYCE but the rolls are comparably priced.  Like almost all great Vegas restaurants, the place is in a strip mall, tucked in a corner spot. Although unassuming, the restaurant itself is actually kinda big.  I didn't look too closely but I believe they have the sushi boats in the center bar.   The service was excellent. The food came out quick and when we ordered some lasagna roll, the waitress advised that it would take 10-15 minutes to bake and come out.     There is an extensive menu of sushi to choose from -- we had several rolls, including the Screaming Orgasm, XXX, Monkey Roll, and something with mango and creme cheese (two things I love).  All the rolls were delicious and the fish was very fresh.  Once again, I'm amazed about the quality of sushi in Vegas -- you know, being land locked and all. I was very satisfied with I Love Sushi, and will go again."}
{"text":"1 hour 45 minutes for delivery.  Unfortunately, I am unable to comment on the quality due to the extremely poor service (no explanation/apology/offer to compensate either). I have previously read about their terrible delivery times, but I'll give most places a chance. I will not be giving \"I Love Sushi\" a 2nd chance. Even for Etobicoke / Japanese restaurants, this is unnaceptable."}
{"text":"Very good sushi love the restaurant,friendly  Staff !the place is pretty clean ! I recomended this restaurant"}
{"text":"my favorite sushi place in vegas! best time to go is early when they're not so busy and the atmosphere is a lot more laid back but going when it's busy is fun too when the sushi chefs are louder than the customers haha!"}
{"text":"First, it's a great atmosphere.  Don't be fooled by the plain exterior, the interior is nicely decorated in Japanese theme, and the waitresses and chefs are all in traditional Japanese attire.  I am a big chef's special guy when it comes to eating sushi, and I Love Sushi has a huge selection (100+) of excellent chef's special rolls and dishes.    Some of my favorite special rolls:  -Spring Mountain (my all-time favorite so far): spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, spicy crab, tempura shrimp, avocado, radish sprout wrapped in rice paper, special sauce (spicy mayo & eel). -Something Wrong #7: spicy soft shell crab in and out, cucumber & 5 different fish on top & chef's special sauce. -Monkey Roll: salmon, cream cheese, avocado, mango, tempura crumbs outside and mango sauce. -Jackpot Special -I Love Sushi Special  Each of their special rolls typically runs between $10 - $13 for 1 whole roll (8 pieces).  I find that getting 3 full rolls will typically fill me and one other person up."}
{"text":"I love sushi is your average sushi joint pretty much.  The service can be slow sometimes and their delivery is painfully slow BUT, they serve the steamed rice in a heart shape, the prices are decent and they play these weird Asian covers of pop songs that make it hella worth it.  Plus, it's the only sushi joint on the stretch of Queen between Spadina and Bathurst, so what the hell right?"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! One of my favorite sushi places in the Valley. I have not dined in yet, always get it to go, and it's always so good!! Bam bam roll is amazing!! Also love the screaming O!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Very nice service, fresh food and everything came out in a timely manner. I love this place. It's going to be my new regular spot"}
{"text":"I Love Sushi is one of my favorite places to go when I am not wanting to do \"all you can eat.\"  The menu offers a lot of choices.  My personal favorite is the \"What's Your Name?\" roll.  It's delish!  I took a friend who had never tried sushi before there, and she was hooked! The atmosphere is nice, the staff is friendly, and service is quick.  Some reviews have said to avoid it during peak hours, but I have been there for dinner several times, and I don't recall ever having to wait more than a couple minutes."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with the wife and kid and we all loved it. The food was  delicious and service was quick and friendly. Our 7 year old daughter is a picky eater but she had no trouble scarfing down the shrimp and veggie tempura some pot stickers and even a few pieces of the lobster roll. We spent about the same as any other sushi restaurant so that was no surprise. Definitely going back....could be the new favorite, Sorry Sumo"}
{"text":"After living and working in Japan my wife and I enjoy  \"I love Sushi\" I have had several items for both lunch and dinner. Yesterday I had the veggie yakisoba and my wife had the spicey tuna roll plus the noodle soup."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great service. For sure my favorite sushi place in town!  If you are looking for outstanding sushi you are at the right place. The waiters are super friendly and you never have a long wait once ordered."}
{"text":"We love this place.  My husband and I take all of our out of town relatives here.  They have a huge selection of rolls, and sake, as well as bento boxes for people such as my husband who don't eat sushi.  My favorite is the Shawn Roll; so good!"}
{"text":"Oh Thank God. Oh thank GOD that a sushi place in Vegas is not going to be a terrible, suburban washed sushi joint. I love sushi, I bow to you. I worship at your delicious menu and your fantastic service, and your overall Zagat awesomeness.   Sit at wooden tables and be served by wonderful ladies in kimonos equip with the shoes and all. They hand you a quick sushi list where you can check off any one of the nearly 100 sushi options they have. Don't get confused, the sushi is not listed in the folding menu, but on a stand at the end of the table. Names will make you giggle in front of your parents as you ask for \"I love my ass\" and \"Tastes like my x-girlfriend\". In fact, I sometimes have to stray from the awkward named ones because I'm almost always at sushi joints with my folks when back home. I resolved on Burning My Stomach ( which is probably sexual..somehow) and the Banzai Roll. The banzai roll is a delicious sweeter roll with teriyaki sauce wrapped in rice paper.   What really opened me up was the Burning My Stomach.  Really spicy crab meat dumped on more spicy crab and shrimp inside a roll surrounded by a thick layer of sashmi cut tuna. The flavor in this is insane. It's too big to eat in one bite, but maybe that's how you like it.   My mouth was burning so much afterward that water just made the temperature decrease from 200F to 199 F. Had to settle on a nice plum wine ice cream to give myself a break. It was perfectly sweet and tart just at the last minute that I had to eat the entire bowl, good thing I'm starting that \"diet\" next year.   I love sushi. I do. And now, I love you."}
{"text":"Old staple in the hood, great atmosphere. always high energy and hard to not run into someone you know every time. All the guys @ the sushi bar are fun and personable. good sushi great variety.  Always finish with the oyster shooter."}
{"text":"LOVEEEE THIS PLACE! One of my favorites (if not my favorite) sushi spots in Vegas.  My boyfriend and I have been coming here pretty frequently the past year. And I always crave this place after like a week of not going.  The fish is extremely fresh and perfectly cut. Their oyster shooters are a great way to end the meal I would definitely recommend the Eddie special roll as well"}
{"text":"So today I went into I Love Sushi with my family, we are regulars at the joint and always get the same Spicy tuna handrolls and garlic edamame. As usual the food was excellent but the reason for my 3 star was very poor customer service our waitress was very rude and seemed too lack common sense serving skills overall experience was okay I really think they should consider retraining she was a horrific employee"}
{"text":"The service at I Love Sushi is as good as the rolls, I drive past a dozen sushi spots on my way to I Love Sushi... Because I Love Sushi. Do yourself a favor and get a Sex on the Sushi, Rolley Rice Bowl, and the Screaming Orgasm."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the world!   My list: One Night Stand Happy Ending Sexy Time Ryan Special  Cant go wrong with these. Ive been going to this joint since the day it opened. Very rarely does it disappoint! Edwin is the best too! Its always busy for dinner time so come early or prepare to wait."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the service is horrible. If the food wasn't good, this would be a 1-star review. I recommend going for delicious sushi but don't expect the waitress to be on her toes. We had to get up to find her to say that we were ready for the bill. And that was after waiting for a long time."}
{"text":"I've been to many sushi restaurants around town and this has got to be the best one thus far. Great service, fresh fish, and a relaxing ambience. Always a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas! I promise!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Japenese in Vegas. We try to make it there every time we get to town. It's out of the way but worth the drive.we always enjoy the spicy tuna roll. Everything is prepared to perfection."}
{"text":"The best ingredients in any sushi Ive had, I Love Sushi stands in a class of its own. Definitely check it out"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Try the \"Kiss of Fire\" and \"The Crunch-Roll.\""}
{"text":"They know me by name I eat there so much! While my favorite thing on the menu is their caterpillar roll, I do sometimes experiment with new things. I haven't had anything bad.  Definitely the best sushi place I've eaten at in all of Las Vegas. Service is always great. If you order for pickup, I've generally found them to give you a time 5 to 10 minutes later than it actually takes before they have it ready."}
{"text":"***Korean-owned*** (you wouldn't get mexican food made by chinese people would you?) I came here because my roommate used to live in Henderson and recommended it...The food wasn't bad, not the best sushi rolls I've ever had. I had the Screaming Orgasm, Tastes like my ex-girlfriend, and several other rolls which weren't as memorable. The shishito peppers were a total ripoff, i've had way better and fresher ones made at other Japanese restaurants.   The service was terrible. Our sushi-chef Ray (i think that was his name), was very accommodating, but the servers were all very impolite and sometimes rude. It took my girlfriend three times to get an order of the shishito peppers and when the waitress forgot she gave us a disgusted look. The waitress also knocked over our chopsticks onto the sushi bar on multiple occasions and didn't even bother giving us a new set, she just put them back on our plates.  Pricewise the place is decent. For the three of us (two guys, one girl), the check was approximately $70 including tip and we left decently stuffed. Would I come back? Probably not unless a friend suggested it."}
{"text":"The sushi here is so good and fresh that it literally melts in your mouth. The waitress was extremely friendly and the service was quick. This is a must go to sushi place."}
{"text":"Great rolls, great, attentive service, fast turnaround time for food, even when it's busy! Overall amazing experience and meal here."}
{"text":"The service as well as the food at I Love Sushi was great. Our server had made the overall experience even that much better due to her attention to detail. Will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, always has been always will be! I have come here since day 1 as a date spot and now many years later as a daddy daughter night out. Hope all you take the chance to experience this very friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. During the latest incident our sushi took over an hour with barely any acknowledgment from the server.  45min into waiting she said \"I know, long time\" and left without another word. A guy who sat after us threatened to leave and he got his sushi before us. We did get a small complimentary bowl of edamame when our food finally arrived. I wish the staff was more proactive. Sit at the sushi bar!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi spot in Vegas that I've been to so far. Highly recommend yakisoba and the deep fried Inari sushi! When we have the money this is one of my favorite places to go. The whole atmosphere is really cool as well. I've heard people say its kinda cheesy but I enjoy it.   But I wouldn't recommend going if you're right on funds as they are expensive.  Also make sure if you're a Vegetarian and asking for teriyaki they give you teriyaki and not eel sauce. One of the guys argued with my friend one time saying that they're the same thing because he didn't jut wanna walk to the kitchen and grab teriyaki for her or ask a waitress to or something."}
{"text":"Food:  This place is a shadow of what it used to be. The udon noodle soup was warm, not even hot enough to cook the egg they dropped in. Mind you I don't want it boiling but is it too much to ask to have some steam rising from the bowl?  Service:  It's busy, I get it. Some mistakes disrupt a good time. Out of order delivery of food, asking for a fork multiple times--more than twice, and cold non-sushi food.  Cleanliness:  I felt like I walked into a gas station, the bathrooms wreaked of shit and urine. Clean that up please. Remember most of us are either getting ready to eat, eating, or just finished eating. Vomiting is not my favorite after dinner activity.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Yakitori is really good here, the miso is soso, and the rest looked good, but i don't like sushi..the staff is really nice and all in all a fun place."}
{"text":"You know, the sushi here isn't as great as everyone on here says it is. Subpar would  be an exaggeration. My wife got the crunchy roll and the rainbow roll. There wasn't much flavor in both and the fish wasn't very fresh. I myself got their lunch special with the fried pork and teriyaki chicken, and the chicken was a little on the burn side and the pork was dry.  All in all if you like bland food this place is for you but if you like food with lots of flavor I'd find another place to dine if I were you."}
{"text":"I have been here before and was expecting some quality food and service, but tonight they really brought their A game.   I Ordered salmon (sake) and mackerel (saba) nigiri. Delicious! Just some really fresh fish with subtle flavor to it. I don't know what it was, but it tasted just right. Wife ordered some sushi rolls (caterpillar, salmon skin, and philly) along with some udon noodles, also good, but I think I was still in a daze from the first course. I will say this though, sometimes we pop in just to have some udon and an order or two of sushi.  I liked that we were seated at a table as soon as we walked in the door, though that's probably due more to luck and good timing. I was really impressed by our waitress, fast and friendly, she really took care of us. When she noticed that the plates that came out first were dishes that my wife wasn't eating she immediately went back to the kitchen and brought another plate as soon as it was ready. I thought that was some damn fine service, worthy of 5 stars. So, thanks for dinner everyone at I Love Sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered from here once. Got food poisoning. Sushi wasn't good at all and the soy sauce was much too salty."}
{"text":"I had heard mulitple extremely good comments about \"I love sushi\" and decided to give it try, even though i am not the biggest sushi fan.  The first thing I noticed when we sat down was the big menu with such great options... The screaming orgasm is absolutely to die for.  Price is good, service is ok.  Wouldn't say it's great, wouldn't say it's bad.  Overall, it's very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas! Try the Happy End as a last special and you won't regret."}
{"text":"A paradise away from the overcrowded touristy places on the strip. If the names of the custom rolls (pages of them) doesn't amaze you, the taste will. Plus the chefs at the sushi bar are a riot.  The prices here are fantastic enough that my friend and I stuffed our faces (we're both big guys) and the tab didn't even make a dent in our wallet. Quick service, delicious creations, and clean eating area. Lots of eye candy too :)"}
{"text":"this place is so so awful never ever eat here I thought I was going to throw up not because of how full I was for AYCE but because of how nasty the rolls were. The only reason I finished was because they charged .50 cents per roll. I ordered a green dragon roll which is pretty normal among sushi places and it always comes with fresh salmon; this place stuffed the whole roll with fake crab and a bit of rotting avocado on the top. I'm just waiting for the food poisoning to hit me  don't do it!!!"}
{"text":"When you're in Las Vegas, but away from the strip, this is definitely a great place to go for cheap, yet delicious sushi!  It's about a 10 minute drive from the strip, where the plazas are all similar and filled with fast food and restaurants of all sorts. But I plead that you go down the road just a bit further to find this gem tucked away inside one of the plazas.  Upon entering the restaurant I couldn't help but notice the decor and the great atmosphere it had. It wasn't that the waitresses wore kimonos, nor was it the fact that the sushi chef all wore read outfits with a hat. The place itself it dimly lit, but gives off a warm feeling. There are both booth seats in front of the sushi chefs, as well as tables and booths. The booths are comfy, intimate and private. Though it didn't feel \"Japanese\" the atmosphere made it feel like it was full of Japanese mannerisms. It's hard to describe, but a welcoming and friendly place to be. You almost forget how bright and hot it is outside.  The service was also great. The waitresses constantly came to our table to make sure everything was okay. It was fabulous. They were not intrusive, and not too passive. It was just the right amount of pleasantry that anyone would desire to have at a restaurant.  The food was also good for the price you pay. Note that Henderson (Las Vegas) is no where near a beach, so don't go expecting freshly flown in tuna from Japan. That being said, the lunch special is a great deal. You get to pick two main entrees (including tonkatsu, soba, vegetable tempura, etc.) which also comes with soup, salad, rice, gyoza, and sometimes inari and tomago, all for just $8 (unless you get beef tonkatsu or a fish entree, not including saba). The sushi rolls themselves are good and made on par with any other Japanese restaurant, but not many I see have the Double D roll! It's quite good I recommend it, no pun intended.  Prices for the sushi is average ($12-14 for a specialty roll), but the lunch special steals the deal! Be sure to go here, I don't think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've had better. We came as a larger group (10) and there was no one else in the restaurant aside from a few take out orders. Took 40 minutes to get our food. The green salad had wilted lettuce and the dressing was not very good. Wasn't a fan if the miso soup either. Too much going on. Wouldn't go back but some at the table really enjoyed it. Nothing to to write home about though."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Henderson.  Quality sushi has been coming out of this place for years.   Always consistent.  Great, friendly service.   The manager is always super nice.  Best deals on sashimi in LV."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The interior is great, the sushi is amazing, & the staff is awesome!  Sushi bar chefs are so attentive and nice  Sushi was super good! Haven't any sushi that wowed me in awhile and their sushi did!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is ok, tables are too close to each other with neighbors talking very loud. Food has moderate taste, either too salty (my Spicy Soft Shell Roll) or drenched in too much eel sauce making it too sweet (Spider Roll)."}
{"text":"Slow service and found a sharp piece of metal in my food. I actually chewed on it. Thank God I did not swallow it. When I brought it to the waitress's attention all she did was apologize and ask me if I want dessert. Then it took a whole hour before my sushi rolls came to the table. They didn't even put in my order. I will never return to this restaurant in fear that I could possibly ingest metal and worst case scenario die!"}
{"text":"Meh. That sums up this place. Came here because I was in the area and I didn't have time to sift through reviews, so went with the 4.5 stars.   Presented with the extensive roll menu, then got a food menu. Had to then ask for a sushi menu. Tells you something about the clientele around here. Can't fault a restaurant for giving the customer what it wants.   I just had an assortment of sushi, was decent. Maybe a slight cut above what you could get at an AYCE place, but not great for the price. The salmon had a slight chemical aftertaste, not sure where it comes from. Sometimes get it at AYCE places too.  Decor is kinda tacky, feels pretty worn. They should definitely look to renovate within the next few years while they are still popular."}
{"text":"Delivered on time (40 minutes) The sushis were not that good, the rice seemed not really fresh, hard actually... The salad was... cheap and nothing to get excited about the soup that came with all that either. First and last time here"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi I've had in Vegas off the strip! The fish is very fresh, which is hard to find in the desert! Sashimi pieces are a very generous size. Mmmmmmmm! The rolls are also huge and have the freshest ingredients. The menu for them can be a little overwhelming! Every time my friends and I go to ILS we always forget what we ordered the last time.   The service is quick and friendly. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar. Those guys are fun and interact with their guests! Atmosphere is upbeat and fun. Seems like everyone goes on a date there. This place gets packed for dinner, especially on the weekends, so be prepared to wait for a table. It can be a little pricey if you're used to AYCE places, but the quality is definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"This place has THE worst sushi, I've ever tasted in my entire life.  Not only is the service horrendous, the food is an abomination.  The sushi was oily and it wasn't even a fried roll.  Barf. Never again. I think I'd rather eat dog food."}
{"text":"I LOVE SUSHI is right! this place rocks!!!  The BF and I always go here to eat. REALLY REALLY GOOD! not to mention, they sell the head bands..my bf rocked it one night at work..luv it!!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a sushi restaurant I love more than this place.  It's hands down my favorite sushi restaurant so far.  The ambiance is good, the food is fantastic, the prices are fair, the service is great.  I always try something new when I go and have yet to be disappointed but I always get the sweet shrimp- they serve it with the head fried.  Not all places do that, in particular sushi buffets, which I'm not very fond of."}
{"text":"My local friend took us here, swearing that it was the best sushi ever. I was skeptical but dang, he was right! The fresh wasabi was amazing. You'll never want to eat that green paste again.  And I don't remember the name of it, but there's a crab bowl with tuna and coveted in avocado which is freaking amazing. All the sushi was fresh and delicious.  I'll make the trek down here for sushi every trip to Vegas from now on, for sure."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. I have been at least 10 times now. By far some of the best sushi I've had so far in Vegas. Their menu is epic with over 100 rolls. The sushi chefs have personality and you are treated well here. I highly recommend this restaurant. The Vegas special OS a great roll to try too."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi I have ever had. The fish quality is amazing. For the price you pay, this is also great value. The o toro sashimi was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Really good sushi, good service, nice atmosphere.  The sushi selection is enormous."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!! Ruined all other Sushi places for me. Bitter-sweet cause it is still sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!  Bam bam is the best roll! Love this place!  Very busy on thr weekends but will accommodate you.  They're pretty quick with your orders.  Become a regular, theyll have your dish ready when u sit down!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The first thing that grabs your attention at I Love Sushi is the atmosphere: somewhat subdued without being too dark, and the servers in kimonos. The next thing is the menu, which is very extensive with most of the rolls having a Las Vegas/risque name to them. The last thing is the food: Excellent, enough said."}
{"text":"Sad to say that I will never return to my old favorite sushi spot. A friend and I decided to come here for dinner after debating between a few other restaurants in the area. I thought that I Love Sushi would be a sure bet because I have dined here and ordered take-out numerous times before and enjoyed it.   Tonight was different. The older woman was our server and she provided us with the worst customer service I've received in a long time. From the moment we sat down, she was very quick and cold with us. No smile, not welcoming in the least bit. She took my order with so much attitude and a sense of annoyance in her voice.  My friend and I ordered Tempura Yakisoba and Teriyaki Shrimp. The food itself was just okay. The Yakisoba was on the sweeter side and the Shrimp was very rubbery.   As I was clearly still working on my food, the woman decides to approach us and just give us the check. No \"Are you all set?\" \"Do you have room for dessert?\" NOTHING. She basically just sat the check on our table. Which also confused me because there was a couple right next to us who had been dining longer than us and she never once approached them with their check. It felt as if she was specifically trying to rush us out.   I have no idea what her issue is or why her customer service skills are so awful, but they have lost a loyal customer. I will no longer be returning or suggesting this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place, period. Since first coming here 2 years ago, everywhere else I go for sushi is almost disappointing in comparison. The rolls are large and the fish is fresh. The waitresses wear kimonos which is super cute and are always friendly.   My personal favorite roll is the Kiss of Fire. The Japanese Lasagna is also a must try."}
{"text":"i'm really not too into i love sushi.  i agree with carly a.  i think this place appeals to vegas kids, because f the crazy sushi roll names.  i don't like how most of the items are deep fried.  i've had a few people tell me that they like i love sushi, because the fish is the freshest...to be honest, i can't tell.    really...even though the menu seems extensive, it seems like the rolls are all just a different combination of the same ingredients in each roll."}
{"text":"Will never buy again. Read the reviews only after ordering, food is disgusting, so is the service. Couldnt eat it, my dog couldnt eat it! What a waste of 60 bucks"}
{"text":"We came here for a little snack , we sat outside on the deck and it was quite comfortable. I liked the vancouver maki (with a big block of cream cheese inside!), but the royal roll (with unagi) didn't really have much unagi in it, and the rice was quite mushy. The salmon sashimi was fresh, but they were really thin slices.  One funny thing we found was the tea pot and tea cups were Chinese, plates were French, chopsticks were Japanese, while the napkin rack was Vietnamese."}
{"text":"My go to spot in Henderson for Sushi. I will not go anywhere else!  Food is always fresh with a great service. They have a huge selection and variety of rolls, so you will definitely find something you will like. Prices are slightly higher than average but it's worth it to me for fresh Sushi and nice size servings. I eat a lot of Sushi and this is one of my favorite spots :)"}
{"text":"This place has it all.  Great food, great service, great prices and screaming orgasms.    I moved here from the Bay Area one year ago and I eat sushi at least once a week.  This place is definately my favorite.    EXCELLENT!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Seared Ahi Tuna is amazing!  And I love all of the different creative names for the sushi options."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this place several times and we love \"I Love Sushi\"!    The food is always fresh, fast and great tasting...equally important is the stellar service we consistantly receive from the girls dressed in their traditional geisha garb.  I can't say enough great things about this place!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant no stars and still submit this review through I would. This place serves cat food quality sushi. By that I mean they make their \"spicy tuna rolls\" out of canned tuna.  You get what you pay for here. Don't be fooled by the cheap prices or the fact there is a coupon for them in the Entertainment book (that's why my friend and I got suckered in).  To top things off the service was horrible. The waitress had an awful attitude.. she never checked on our table we had to walk up to the counter to ask for water and the bill. I guess the service went well with the cat food."}
{"text":"Best sushi of my life go here ALL THE TIME! You know somewhere has good sushi when they don't have all you can eat! \"Screaming O\" with chefs special sauce is amazing ! Service is typical for a sushi place they all drop the food fast and refill you drinks often. Definetly go here ! Amazing amazing amazing"}
{"text":"I read some bad reviews about a rude waitress who could be easily spotted as heaviest one.  I am afraid that I met the same one so I got very bad experience at this restraunt.  I brought my whole family to spend the lunch time together.   As soon as we got there and waited to be seated, she showed no smile and unpatiently to serve us.  Also, she was very rude to my mom who held my 2 years old daughter.  It just seemed like we owed her a lot of money.    Although we were unhappy, we tried to understand her behavior  like she probably argued with her boss this morning or got a ticket on the way home.   No, we were wrong.  She was not unhappy because she smiled to other customers except us!  Is that because we are the only asian at that lunch time?  Cannot believe that she had discrimination on asian especially she is asian too!  I assumed that the restaurant should tell the asian customers like us \"no service to you because you konw our food too much\".  Yes their food sucks as we have tried asian food for decades and they are the worst one!   We really know too much:)"}
{"text":"My Huney and I visited this place during lunch while on vacation! It is amazing! The quality of fish is superior. We are back tonight because we have not had enough. The i love sushi special is amazing. It is spicy tuna roll wrapped in tuna-- leave the mayo at home, great Asian vinegar holds this spicy tuna together . The no-rice options are superb especially the salmon avocado pesto. This is 20 mins off the Strip and OMG its worth it.  Go there."}
{"text":"Service is great when they're not busy and good when they're busy.  Nice atmosphere.  Good food.  Highly recommended.  Rarely a long wait unlike the \"budget\" sushi places."}
{"text":"I LOVE SUSHI.  I really do. This is one of my all time favorite places to go. It has been my main Sushi spot for years. I have had good sushi elsewhere but there is just something comforting about I love Sushi. The rolls taste the same each time so you always know what you are getting, and the quality of what you are getting.   It gets packed here, so arrive early, don't be surprised to wait, book a table to avoid this. If you do wait, it is worth it so get some Sake and relax.  Get the Japanese Lasagna! Don't ask questions, just order it and get back to me.   The Kiss of Fire roll is amazing, Jackpot special roll, Crazy Monkey (or something Monkey I can't recall exactly), and the crunch roll.  There are so many fantastic rolls from the baked, to the raw and everything in between.  I love sushi and always will!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The waitress was dressed in a kimono and the place had great ambiance. I felt like I was transported to Japan. We ordered California Roll and Spider Roll plus a Miso Soup for less than 20 bucks! I will be coming back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Obsessed. If I could give more than five stars I would. Their quality service, attention to detail and amazing food is amazing.. I have been going to I Love Sushi since I was a teen and will continue to be a loyal customer. Try anything! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best sushi and price in town. Highly worth the trip if you're staying on the strip. Make reservations. Busy times are at 6 and 8 pm. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"BEST sushi in Vegas!!! Love sitting at the sushi bar, BoomBoom is amazing! The Ryan Special and the Gary special are so delicious! We are so picky about sushi since we moved from California and there are some of the best sushi restaurants there but this one is close! Must try!!"}
{"text":"Good food, always a line out the door. Alittle pricey per dish that is why only 4 stars."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious and the cooks were real friendly. My only negative comment on the place was they don't have the AYCE option. We all know sushi is expensive, especially when you go for dinner.  Usually an AYCE sushi place for dinner will run u 25-30 dollars. For 3 rolls including tip my bill just for me was around 50 dollars. If this place had AYCE, definitely would've been a 5 star rating from me."}
{"text":"The service was soooo bad. I consider myself a good tipper (20% or more), but I barely left 10%. The waitress took our order for one roll and before I could order our next roll, she was already leaving. I had to stop her, and when I did she rolled her eyes at me. I have never experienced anything like it. Then, it took an hour and a half to get my full order of TWO rolls. It wasn't even busy.  The food wad just meciocre. After reading the reviews, I ordered the Screaming Orgasm and 69 dish (forgot the whole name) because they got such great reviews but they were a total disappointment. I have had a lot of sushi in my time, and some of the best I've had were at small litle places, so I'm pretty open-minded, but this was nothing to write home about. It was hard to gauge the freshness of the fish, seemed like it was thawed, but not really sure. Definitely not going back. Total waste."}
{"text":"I've been on a weird sushi kick and I've been craving it everyday.  I Love Sushi is located near my home.  So every night this week, I've called in my order... I wish they had a drive thru.  Anyhow, I normally don't eat rolls, but I couldn't resist looking at their extensive list of over 80 rolls.  So I gave it a try... Each night, I picked a different one and was not disappointed.  They have some crazy names and mix of a lot of types of fish.  One of my favorites was Eddie's special that had both spicy tuna and spicy scallops on top of a crunch roll.  It was soooo good.  I also tried their amaebi and uni... on Monday, the pieces were small but by Friday the pieces were bigger and meatier.    Thank you I Love Sushi for supporting my sushi addiction."}
{"text":"Very unassuming from the outside of the restaurant. I was new to the neighbourhood and came here one day having a crazy craving for Udon. I had worked up a big enough appetite to try the all-you-can-eat. I have to say that I was very impressed by the quality of food. The sushi rolls had a good amount of fresh, tasty fillings and weren't mostly rice like other AYCE places. I like that the AYCE menu includes appetizers, donburi, udon, soups, sushi, etc. The cheese wontons are to die for- and so is the Avocado Crispy roll. YUM! I have been back 3 times. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews on restaurants, but this sushi place is ridiculously terribly unbearably disgusting. It took 1.5 hour to arrive even though I live in dt. When I first open the box, I thought there were a lot of sashimi. Then, I realized more than half of the \"sashimi\" were actually raw tomatoes. The salmon sashimi is WARM and HALF-COOKED and TERRIBLY STALE. The crab meat in California roll that they give for free is also stale. I highly doubt they made it spicy just to cover up the staleness. I will never ever get food from here anymore."}
{"text":"So there are a lot of good AYCE places that I like in Vegas and those are the places I usually go, because let's face it, I can put away a serious amount of sushi in one sitting.   Although I Love Sushi is not an AYCE restaurant, I like to go there sometimes with my wife because it is top-quality, and it's a waste of money to take her to AYCE because she doesn't even eat that much.   When we go to I Love Sushi, we always get a roll called The Kitchen Sink. It's a no rice roll and it is seriouly the bomb.   The other thing I like about this restaurant is the atmosphere. If Disney World did a sushi restaurant, it would probably look like this. All the servers are in traditional Japanese outfits and the decor is like you're in Japan. They also have real Japanese music playing in the background. I really like it."}
{"text":"The Place: Clean, Casual The Service: Friendly  The Food: Good  This place has a good atmosphere, but I don't think it makes up for the quality of the sushi. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad by any means, but it's not Great / Memorable either."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas! I have eaten at Shibuya (disappointing / over priced), Sushi Samba (ewww) and Social House (great restaurant but very, very mediocre sushi) but nothing comes close to I Love Sushi. My friend used to live in Henderson and when I left the strip to go visit her she would always rave about this awesome sushi restaurant in a random strip mall in the 'burbs. I was skeptical at first but she has worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years so I decided to check it out. Although this place isn't fancy I can truly say it is one of the best sushi restaurants I have eaten at. Truly a hidden gem! Everything is cheap despite the quality ingredients and innovative roles. The service is amazing and the ambiance is fun, lively and laid back. If you want a great meal and are ready to venture off the strip check out this local favorite. My amazing meal with three very hungry people was a whopping $62! Can't wait to go back next time I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"I always come here when I'm craving sushi, and anything less than the best just won't do.  Even though it's a drive for me now, it's still very worth it making the drive here because of the consistency, quality, and service. No complaints, other than they seem to have stopped offering the hot hand towels, and the place can get really loud and hectic during busy times! But service is almost always top notch with promptness at taking orders, refilling drinks, taking away plates, etc.   The Double D roll and garlic tuna nigri are some of the best I've had.  So much good options that it can be very easy to rack up a big bill. But it's worth it."}
{"text":"Don't complain ever about restos or food but this is an honorable mention for the disgusting sushi I had delivered. Most of what I ordered was raw fish, so it all came spoiled. If you can't deliver food in quality just call and say you can't serve it. It's better than getting someone sick."}
{"text":"Yellowtail, salmon handroll with avocado, salmon nigiri and rainbow roll, all excellent !"}
{"text":"No all you can eat here but they make up for that in delicious rolls! Probably one of the better quality near Silverado Ranch/ Seven Hills area  Been there twice one during dinner and another for lunch and even though they were packed the service was sitll great."}
{"text":"Sumi is the most awesome person!!!!! Very attentive, professional, and her recommendations were spot on. The burn in the stomach roll was the best sushi roll ever!!!  Excellent quality sushi and very reasonable prices. We are visiting from so cal and would drive back just for Sumi and sushi"}
{"text":"I never leave bad reviews.. but this was straight up the worst sushi experience I've ever had. I wish I had read the reviews to this restaurant previously.  It was my first time eating here and the sushi itself was alright, I enjoyed the maki rolls. Miso soup was also good as well as the salad. However, our second order of salmon sashimi.. was half-assed frozen. My teeth actually felt noticeably cold after eating it so I got turned off ordering more.  I did not have any issues with our waitress, she was pretty consistent. The chef even came out at some points to bring out our food to us when she wasn't there. ....Until we hit dessert. Now the restaurant was relatively empty aside from a large group reservation (15 ish). Judging by their interactions with the owner, I assume that they knew each other and that person's family was being treated to eat there or something. That group was extremely rowdy as they ordered quite a bit of wine, which is fine. We eventually just tuned them out.  Just after we ordered our ice cream, we saw one of the males in the large party PROJECTILE PUKING to the ground. Now, I thought it was just the amount of food that he had eaten.. however he passed out on the couch/cushioned seats after indicating that he was wasted. I felt even more awful for this guy that came in a bit earlier and had to sit next to them (due to limited space) and we watched him throw the menu and instantly leave. Can't blame the poor guy for being the one sitting at the table next to the male who got sick and witnessed everything first hand.  I always leave room for dessert.. but after that I couldn't finish my ice cream and told the waitress I simply lost my appetite. She seemed annoyed/confused almost but didn't seem to click into WHY we lost our appetite due to the recent events.  I hardly ever go out of my way to leave reviews but I'm extremely unimpressed with this restaurant's service. You would think that a business would at least TRY and limit the amount of booze their guests drink especially if they are a special party. It was the way they handled the situation, no empathy for their customers.   When we were leaving the restaurant, he was still passed out in the same position on the couch/chair. I find it really hard to sympathize with someone over drinks in an AYCE sushi restaurant of all places!!!  Needless to say I am never going back to this restaurant. EVER."}
{"text":"If you don't want to read long reviews, just trust me and don't try this place. Seriously.   I ordered sushi for delivery. I got a teriyaki chicken & some assorted sushi. I was notified that my food was on its way ..... 30 minutes AFTER the expected delivery time. It was completely unreasonable. When they finally did arrive, the driver called to tell me he was outside. I opened my front door, and they were parked outside my house. There were two people in the car, both staring at me. Eventually the driver waved me over. I was wearing boxers and it was January, and I sure as hell wasn't going to pick up my own food from their car. I stood there for about 3-4 minutes until the passenger finally got out, STORMED up the steps and very rudely shoved the food into my hands. I wish I was exaggerating. Unfortunately, I had tipped the driver in advance. The food was awful. The sushi was mediocre but the teriyaki was inedible. Horrible. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"For sushi in Las Vegas and Henderson... this is the ONLY place.  Quail Egg shooters, Uni shooters, unlimited choice of cleverly designed and monikered sushi rolls to satisfy any palette, beautifully prepared, fresh sashimi selections... I could go on but that would waste your time.  You should just start driving and get there.  For those needing a more thorough review - here it is.  James (the owner) and his wonderful band of creative chefs and service staff are a one-in-a-million find.  In 9 years of going to this place 4 times a month, I have never had a less than welcoming and wonderful dining experience.  Lunch or dinner - it makes no difference - you are warmly received, served the best fish in town, and you are quickly absorbed into the electric atmosphere.  The chefs are top notch and have a lot of leeway in terms of creating your perfect dish, even if it's not on the menu.  And that is saying something since their printed menu and roll & specialty menu exceeds 150 items.  Amazing:-)    Their food quality is 5-star.  But what makes it fun is how cleverly written the sushi roll selection menu is - sometimes inappropriate, yes, but always hysterical.  Selections include - Screaming Orgasm (large or small),  Tastes Like My Ex-Girlfriend, I Love My Ass and, of course, the well received I Love My Fat Ass.  The hilarity and creativity of the menu is only exceeded by the fact that all are beautifully prepared and DELICIOUS!   The biggest rave for I Love Sushi is the SERVICE!  Without fail this is the best trained, best managed and smartest group of servers and support staff in town.  One visit, they remember you.  Second visit they remember your name.  Third visit, you are part of the family.  Think Cheers meets the sushi industry - it's a winner.  If you are hankering for a sushi fix, please do not hesitate to join the party at I Love Sushi.  You will not be disappointed!  Tell them Shannon and Lisa sent you!"}
{"text":"Huge variety! Best sushi place in Henderson so far, and I've tried quite a few places."}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh, beautiful and delicious. So much food and it tasted amazing. #28 roll and poke salad are my fave. Service was fantastic."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue! Sitting here wondering which is the best sushi restaurant in Las Vegas with the freshest fish. Hands down I have to say that I love Sushi takes the cake when it comes to quality and quantity. Although it is a bit pricey this place is definitely one of the best in town. They are definitely known for their outrageous names and service. I've come here many times for a causal dining experience, a girl's night out, and a group event. Each time I was never disappointed. If your are in Vegas and want to take a look at how the locals live....take a drive to I love Sushi.  The only bad thing I would have to say is I don't like the location, it's a bit far up South going towards Anthem. I'd prefer a centrally located place, but I guess that's just the way the cookie crumbles...."}
{"text":"I Love Sushi has a very nice layout with a bar in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by tables and booths. All the servers wear   kimonos which is a very nice touch.  The menu is overwhelming with so many choices. Luckily I was with someone who had already been here, so she made some recommendations. The first think to come out was the screaming orgasm. I have had quite a few screaming orgasms, but this one in my opinion was the best I had so far. Because of that we ordered a second \"Pop\". They offer 2 sizes, so the second one wasn't a big O.  We all order some sushi-mi, which was very fresh.  The roll we ordered was a 4x4 no rice from the deep fried section. This was very tasty and I will probably order it again.  The service was excellent and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"My family has been going here since 2005 since it's just around the corner.  Other than location, the sushi is always good.  In an area where all you can eat(AYCE) is just about everywhere, this restaurant does NOT offer that.  Just traditional order what you want and they'll serve it up fresh.  I gauge sushi establishments by my favorite fish, hamachi.  I order both nigiri and sashimi (when I want to spoil myself) I love sushi (ILS) has never disappointed me.  It's always so buttery smooth with that hint of fish.  The cuts are perfect, not to thin/thick.  There are other sushi places around but not \"I-Love-Sushi\" good as my boys will describe it.  Really good atmosphere.  On any given day, it's busy from 5:30pm to 7:30pm but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad dining experience here and I have been coming here for years. Do not come famished. You may be waiting a while to get a table especially on weekends but certainly worth the wait. Cherry blossom and Spring Mountain rolls are my favorite."}
{"text":"ordered food from here off justeat. not only was my food horrid: soggy, poorly made rolls drowning in some kind of sauce but i also overpaid, a lot. the quality of fish was subpar. definitely not worth it. the food smelled weird too, will not order from here again. AVOID AVOID"}
{"text":"Ordered the tonkatsu (Don Katsu) a la carte and it was the worst that I have ever eaten.  Tonkatsu should be boneless pork of a good thickness and moist.  Pork should be trimmed of gristle and fat and breaded with panko and nicely arranged on the plate.  This was scattered all in a corner of the plate, had bone in it, had a lot of gristle and fat and was quite thin.  It was also covered with tempura batter and dry.  Part of Japanese cuisine is the presentation and tempura batter pork plopped on a plate doesn't cut it.  Would warn anyone from eating the tonkatsu."}
{"text":"A fairly non-descript place located in a outdoor shopping area just outisde of Las Vegas but once you are inside, it's quite large and festive. Lots of sushi options as well as cooked options too. Service was very attentive and we had plenty of food.  When it came time for the bill, we were actually surprised at how reasonable the prices were overall.  Would certainly go back when we are in Vegas again."}
{"text":"MY PREVIOUS REVIEW WAS DELETED because I wanted everyone to be aware- DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.   People who work here are RUDE, unhelpful, and do not know anything about running a business or making a customer happy.  They IGNORED SEVERE  ALLERGY requests, yelled at us and told me I was to blame, kept passing the phone around to different employees who yelled \"WHAT YOU WANT?!\" and pretending not to speak any English, all to avoid having the proper items sent. After everything they even refused to give us our money back. Disgusting.  Save your time, save your money, order from ANYWHERE ELSE.   This will most likely get deleted again, but I will be back again."}
{"text":"Terrible. I'm surprised the reviews of this place are so good. The rolls tasted like mayonnaise. Straight up mayo. No rice, no fish, no nothing. I politely told the waitress and she could have cared less. Only come here if you want mayo with a side of rice. Gross."}
{"text":"Hands down, no arguement, THE BEST SUSHI I HAVE EVER HAD! My husband and I went to Australia last year and went to a sushi restaurant thinking \"ok, this has to be great, I mean we're in Australia!\" Mmmm...yeah.....no. Didn't even come close to the amazing sushi at I Love Sushi. I have been all over town and tried other sushi places and I always come back to this place. Keep in mind, it can get really crazy and packed on Friday/Saturday nights so be ready for some lines and loudness. Some of my favorite sushi chefs have left recently but there are still some great guys there....Love ya Boom Boom! I highly recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"Well where to start.  I've been enjoying I Love Sushi for quite a while.  Their \"no rice\" Sushi is a great idea and addition to the menu.  I decided to take my daughter there as she was home for the weekend from summer school.  We went on Friday July 28 at approx 1-1:30pm. I ordered my favorite Spring Mtn Roll.  I was disappointed when it arrived as the roll itself was smaller than all previous trips and it was not on the usual round brown plate (it's normal presentation).  Disappointing to say the least.  I guess I will have to only go at night when sushi chef \"Joe\" is there.  He always makes great sushi and will surprise you if you ask him to make you something special."}
{"text":"After locating another sushi restaurant in the area that has an \"all you can eat\" style menu with a set price, my husband and I stopped going here since we can eat somewhere cheaper. We haven't been back in several months now. Hope they change up the menu and accommodate the consumer a bit more."}
{"text":"I am a BIG sushi lover... and I LOVE I Love Sushi! Its one of the best sushi places ive ever been to. I recommend it to all my friends, and they always love it!"}
{"text":"Do not order from here!! Ordered take out for me and some friends, and half of the order was missing. When I called the restaurant to tell them, they argued with me! and kept telling me to check the bottom of the bag... I'm hungry, not stupid. I waited another hour after the first delivery and the replacement items still hadn't come! I called back and told the restaurant to forget it!! That's absolutely ridiculous, if a restaurant messes up an order that should be made a priority. The sushi I did have was cold, was not fresh and tasted rancid. Also would have wanted more than 3 spring rolls for $5.50... bit pricey if you ask me.   First time ordering from here and it will definitely be my last."}
{"text":"Ok. Sushi. Price is average. The only issurcwas that they brought the tempura appetizer after the sushi . Also it seems that they sell thai and japanese food... which doesnt really entice the the consumer."}
{"text":"As good as it gets.  Fresh sushi. Awesome service.  Awesome menu.  The sushi chefs are friendly. The owner is friendly. The wait staff is friendly.  Did I mention the food is awesome too?  This might be the best restaurant in Vegas period."}
{"text":"My favorite local sushi spot! Food is delicious and roll are unique. The service is really good and the sushi chefs treat you like a rockstar!"}
{"text":"Used to be the best sushi place in town, but they got rid of our favorite sushi chef and now the place isn't the same.  I am sure the sushi is still really good as it was always fresh and prepared quickly."}
{"text":"Something Wrong 69 and Screaming Orgasm...if you can get over saying the order you will not regret what you receive! The service is quick and the sushi and sashimi is top notch. This place is always pretty crowded for dinner but they usually can seat a small party within 10mins.  All sushi is served with a small cucumber salad and ginger and wasabi. The Something Wrong 69 sushi roll and Screaming Orgasm sashimi plate are both our go to entrees. Both of these are paired with an unbelievable sauce that they make that seriously will have you craving this place 24/7.   To go with our sushi we always get Light Kirin beer and a Sapporo. You can't go wrong with a little hot sake to go with your beers."}
{"text":"I don't get this place. Servers and management don't speak English so if they make a mistake or screw up your food they still let you pay for it. Very average sushi with lots of creams to cover the flavor."}
{"text":"What can I say? I pink puffy heart love I Love Sushi. We moved across town and it has been our favorite find. It's a real gem. The staff is great (bar and table service), the fish is fresh and the rolls are fun and mighty tasty. In the past few months we've been half a dozen times.   When it comes to rolls we prefer those that are spicy. Sexy Time Special, Kiss of Fire and Sun Devil are favorites. They are a must each and every time. We also enjoy the sashimi. The yellowtail is like butter. The screaming orgasm is a great alternative. We've enjoyed others, but their names escape me. Each and everyone is delicious, though. I have no doubt everything is well executed. So thankful, it's not AYCE. I much prefer quality to quantity."}
{"text":"One of the best in Toronto for ayce. They have amazing mango rolls, and rolls wrapped in cucumber! I love this place, super fresh, awesome! My only complaint is that there is a 1.5 hour time limit."}
{"text":"I've dine here many times and have had some great meals.. Until tonight. Food poisoning is not fun!"}
{"text":"Awsome sushi, fresh and fast. I would go back over and over. The prices are high but thats to be expected from a place like this one. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for AYCE sushi so we just popped in without checking Yelp/reviews. Wasn't a wise move. Sushi was pretty average, they didn't bring out a bunch of what we ordered. The server seemed a bit too keen on rushing our orders, which made no sense as the place was empty otherwise."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi I have ever had, and I've eaten at the most expensive tables at TAO. I Love Sushi is always fresh, and perfectly prepared. I've been eating in and ordering take out from here for about five years and every single time the rolls taste the exact same each time ordered. Jackpot Special has become the favorite of every person I bring here: including people who have been eating sushi their entire lives (unlike me who only started as an adult). I've been loving the Japanese lasagne recently and so I get the jackpot special and that and it is HEAVEN. The employees treat you so well, and it's such a clean and pretty atmosphere. They accidentally burnt my Japanese lasagne last time and when I showed up they apologized and said they were remaking it and seconds later walked out with the new one..just an example of how they won't serve anything but the best."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The Sashimi Salad is EXCELLENT! Menu is a bit pricey but worth it.   Staff is friendly and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"I love sushi is hands down the best sushi! The I love sushi roll is my favorite, the tuna melts in your mouth. Good quality fish for a great price, don't waste your time or money on sushi on the strip."}
{"text":"The fish here is so fresh, service is fast! Tuna Poke is some of the best I've had! It's sooo good!"}
{"text":"I love this place but last weekend me my wife and our 2 year old had a reservation for 6:30 we got there on time then after waiting for 45 min I ask how long and they said 15 to 30 min more. Just crazy they lie to you on how long you must wait. We decided to go somewhere else.  Go during the week much better!"}
{"text":"I totally dug the enterior but that is where it stopped. The rolls all pretty much were the same rolls on the menu,but named different things,looked the same when they came out and were WAY over priced. I live downtown Vegas and drove here because I was on a date, I think I would be much better off at an all you can eat sushi joint on Flamingo,rather than drive to Timbucktoo and pay out the butt for mediocre sushi. The sushi chefs however were very entertaining while chugging booze with the people at the sushi bar and making everyones sushi. That was a plus with the entertainment there."}
{"text":"I came here because of all the great reviews. We were seated quickly and service was quick but it's the food that matters. The only roll I like was the kitchen sink. Also had the orgasm, tastes like my ex girlfriend and a couple others that I don't remember the name but they all had too much sauce and it's a bit pricey for the amount you get. There seems to be plenty of other sushi restaurants in the area so I won't be stopping by again"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.. Took an hour ..   I ordered a 26 piece combo and in that combo I got four pieces of artificial crab STICK on rice.  Then the driver tried to rip me off an extra ten dollars ..   Would never order or even consider dining in."}
{"text":"Best sushi place ever!! Very exotic and different sushi rolls. All their fish is fresh and I have never been disappointed. I get spicy tuna handroll w/ soy paper, Ryan's special , kiss of fire , cherry blossom. Trust me you won't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Very attentive servers, and sushi chefs... very prompt service... It seemed just as we would order, the sushi roll was made in under a few minutes. Twice I've eaten here and found it to be great food, service, large variety of menu options, good atmosphere, and reasonably priced. definitely check it out"}
{"text":"this place is incredible. i love the towel they give you to wipe down your hands when you're first seated! Love the food (they have funny names for them). Fish is definitely fresh and customer service is EXCELLENT!!"}
{"text":"Just had another magnificent dinner here.  We don't visit Las Vegas very often, but whenever we do, we always devote at least one dinner to this place.  Not only does it provide us a break from the chaos of the Strip, but the food here is fantastic! You will Definitely get far more value for your money here than on the Strip.  If you do come, you have to try the Ika Tempura!  We had 2 orders last night.  Crispy on the outside, and soft, but slightly firm (as it should be) on the inside!  Yum!   The staff is almost alarmingly attentive!  (unlike trying to get any kind of service in the Strip Casinos) It goes without saying, but I will anyway, that the Sashimi is top notch!  The pieces of fish, etc, are gratifying of sufficient size as to make them visible/identifiable to the naked eye...not always the case (these days) If you need a delicious break from the Strip, and your tastes turn toward sushi, you really should try this place.  I Love Sushi is (probably) a Franchise...this particular one is the BEST that we've found!"}
{"text":"These guys by far have the best service in town when it comes to sushi restaurants.  We love coming here because we know we will always be taken care of.  On top of that the food is great!"}
{"text":"I love Sushi!  The name of this place is exactly what I say mid-meal and post-meal every single time I eat here.   First things first, their entire sushi menu is the best in the world. No joke. The creativity in their rolls is uncanny, no other sushi place compares.   Second, their fish is fresh. Absolutely freshest i've had in Las Vegas.   Third, their uni shooter is heaven in a shot glass. The best mixture of uni, spice and citrus that tickle every inch of your palate.  Our go-to order is the \"Screaming orgasm\", Uni shooters, a few pieces of sashimi and a roll or two. We try to order a new roll every time we go. Definitely my favorite place to get sushi in Vegas, if not the US."}
{"text":"Service is great, and you get pretty good quality. The menu is huge, so it will take customers a couple visits to find rolls that match their preference."}
{"text":"There is some good sushi out there -- not much, but some. This one is GREAT -- the best in Las Vegas. If you want to kick things up a notch, ask for the Spicy Ponzu instead of using regular soy sauce. The sushi always tastes fresh and their rolls are very creative. Service is always quick. One of my favorite go-to places."}
{"text":"Lively, Gimmicky, Good Food.  This Anthem spot isn't for the sushi purist, but rather the sushi lover that takes quality more seriously than the dish's name.    Japanese Lasagna, Tastes like my ex-wife, and Screaming orgasm are all rolls featured on the menu at I Love Sushi.  I've never had a bad bite of anything here.  My only complaint about the food, is that many of the rolls are bathed in sauce.  For me, this is a no-no.  A little sauce is alright, but drowning something in spicy mayo only aims to hide poor quality ingredients, and the quality here is superb.  Even when this place gets jumping, and it does, the service is outstanding.  Food arrives in a timely manner, and is at the right temperature.    The Sushi Bomb here is out of this world, and definitely my favorite thing on the menu.  It is simple and satisfying.   It is tuna or salmon sashimi served with fresh wasabi.  This is HOT HOT HOT.  Stuffy sinuses seak shelter from this inferno of tasty heat.    A great date spot, I Love Sushi is a solid choice for good quality fish in the Anthem area."}
{"text":"amazing reasonable sushi rolls!!! Love Gary's roll. generous with the ingredients & SO FRESH!  Super Fast service & attentive. All severs work here looked happy & with very up beat attitude. The owner is always present at the restaurant. Only people that seemed way serious were the sushi chiefs."}
{"text":"Horrible service and so-so food. A server actually yelled at us as we were walking out of the restaurant. The manager had to restrain him from attacking us.   What prompted this behaviour, you ask? All we did was point out a couple of incorrect orders. We didn't want to be charged for food we didn't order. That's it. He also clearly didn't know the difference between chicken and fish.   Apparently this server has such a shitty life in that it manifested in the way he treated us. Yup, this server who wore jogging pants and a t-shirt at his job.  So I wondered, was it entitlement on his behalf? Since he believed he had the right to speak to others (and dress) that way..who knows? All I know is that we're never returning to this restaurant. And it baffles me that they're still in business when others would be so grateful for such an opportunity. Spend your hard earned cash elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the staff. They seemed very busy and annoyed to be bothered. We ordered the show boat. It came with condiments  such as tarter sauce and the roll and sashimi selection it included was below average. There was no redeeming factor to this meal other then my husbands company and when we got home I fed the leftovers to the dogs. If you want an authentic experience with good service and good quality  steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"I dig the name of the restaurant, because I myself L-O-V-E sushi literally.   The service is terrific here. Every time I come here, they always greet customers as you enter. Staff is friendly, fast, and efficient. And I've always sat at the sushi bar - I like to be up close and personal with the sushi chef and see what they're doing.   The sushi is great. They offer a variety of special roll's. However, I ordered screaming orgasm and wooow... the seared tuna was fresh with there tasty sauce, and not chewy.    To top it off, an order of Nigori sake makes it all worth while. It compliments the sushi and seared tuna all together."}
{"text":"One star for the okay food, another star for actually getting the food delivered safely... for the quality of the food you are getting at the price, it's not worth it. Overfried dumplings and tempura... tiny ass pieces of sushi and only 6 pieces... go to Sushi California on st Clair west, it's the best in Toronto i dont know why i decided to try some place new .what a waste"}
{"text":"Great place!!!! Ate here on valentine's night and still was able to get great service.... and food was excellent. Anyone that is complaining doesn't know what there talking about. ..."}
{"text":"Quick sushi that's a stone's throw away? I say a-ok.   I've come by here in some sushi-craving, take out-needing moments. It happens. Within minutes of ordering, a large white bag comes my way with all the bento box accoutrements I could ask for, for something like $13.   Is it the best sushi of life? No, but the value is there, there's always some people inside and it can be tasty."}
{"text":"I mean come on. Best sushi in Vegas. Period  Traditional. It's not. It's a mind blowing culinary experience. So many creative creations. And the names are so funny.   100% of the time we visit Vegas we come here. We take the ride to Henderson and enjoy ourselves at I Love Sushi. Funny thing is I heard of this place 10 yrs ago watching Poker on TV and the pro players were talking about it. So happy I love poker. But happier I love Sushi  They literally have ~100 different rolls. All I can say is read them all and focus on the type of fish you love and just try it.   I highly recommend I Love Sushi to anyone who goes to Vegas"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the worst sushi I've ever had :( And sushi is my absolute favourite food ever and I've had a LOT of different sushi from Toronto restaurants and beyond.   I can honestly say I was disgusted. It's awful tasting, tastes super old, and even the dynamite roll was AWFUL. Dynamite is myfavourite, I've never went to a place that messed up a simple dynamite roll.   I have no idea why this place is still serving food... it surely can't be good for you when it's that far from fresh. PS - I am NOT picky about sushi because I love it all, but this place is absolutely gross.   The service was ok and they were very nice but please don't waste your money on such awful food ugh literally worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"It's pretty good.  Really liked the sushi boat.  Very busy place and staffs are friendly.  We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great rolls are Flower, Monkey, Gary Special, and Tastes Like my Ex Girlfriend are all awesome!! Oh and Threesome is tasty and cool cuz it has mozzarella cheese in it  wife lovessss"}
{"text":"Best Japanese food in Vegas by far.  Before I even get to saying how amazing the food was I will start with the atmosphere. We got sat at a table with walls around it so it was almost like having our own room. The waitresses wear traditional Japanese garments and speak very little English. It's considered casual but you would look a little under dressed if you showed up in board shorts and flip flops. It is a very cool setup and added to the experience.   Now about the amazing food. Sadly enough I didn't try the sushi but I did get the vegetable tempura which was absolutely amazing. Hands down the best I have ever had. My sister got the chicken Lo mein and it had such an amazing flavor to it I wanted to eat her whole meal! My boyfriend got the platter with shrimp tempura and teriyaki chicken. It was huge and he loved it. I think he picked the best thing on the menu!   Overall it was amazing and definetly will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"The pad thai was bland and dry, not cooked right. I wasn't able to eat it, which was quite a disappointment."}
{"text":"Nice surprise. Invited by a friend. Best FRESHEST most tasty sushi I've had in a long time.  EVERYTHING I ate felt perfect in taste, temperature and texture. Loved the crisp fresh salads and how very clean and neat the place was."}
{"text":"Great service ,very nice ambience .wr orded the spy edaname is excellent so is the extreme orgasam and the iced tea is so delicious ,mist definitely we come back again"}
{"text":"I Love Sushi has been around forever!! they have great quality sushi; however, they are pricey and can get extremely crowded. their servers are always friendly and efficient. their 3 sum roll is to die for- I've never had a roll here I didn't like! the only downside is spending a small fortune for some sushi~ other than that, totally recommend."}
{"text":"Best. Sushi. Ever. This place is a MUST if you are in Vegas/Henderson. Always amazing food and friendly staff. My faves are the sunomono and sashimi salads. We take all of our friends and family from out of town here. Very busy on the weekends, so reservations are helpful. Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I have been to I Love Sushi for both dine-in and takeout. My most recent I Love Sushi experience was takeout, my date had order our party tray through the web. Within 45 minutes, our food arrived. I was impressed by the quick delivery.   The rolls were fresh and tasty. They had an interesting fried maki roll, where I have not seen anywhere else. We had about 60 pieces in our tray, much was left over for another meal.   I would order from them again given the convenience and quickness of delivery service."}
{"text":"I was told about this lil gem by some friends from out of town. So if an out of towner leaves the strip to get food, it's gotta be good right? This is one of the few sushi places I've been to in Vegas that I can say is AWESOME! This place not only has fresh food, but the service is fast! I was first provided w/ a warm towel. Never been given this at ANY sushi place I've been to. That right there grabbed my attention. We arrived right when they opened so they were still getting ready. For waiting 5 minutes they brought out edmame. You can see that they want to make their customers happy.  They have quite the variety of rolls from baked to deep fried to regular rolls. If you're looking for something w/ some kick try the Kiss of Fire. The mountain blast is another good one to try. Most of the rolls do have some sauce that come on them. The price is typical, the service is great, & the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"NICE! The sushi portions are perfect! The staff is on point when their slammed. They have a steady flow of customers. NO mini Tapas crap here. Show me the UNI.... I approve this message JK KUHL"}
{"text":"I feel like I was tricked by my fellow Yelpers... Service was below average. We weren't greeted by the hostess or our waitress. The nicest employee was the busser. She actually noticed that one roll was left pretty much untouched and asked how it was. The shrimp tempura was cold and extremely dry. She didn't take it off our bill, but at least she apologized. Agedashi tofu was good, but none of the rolls we tried was impressive. If anything, they sucked.  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is worth the 20min drive.  The sushi is delicious.  The names of the rolls are entertaining and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"I have taken my family several times. It was good the first two times. We usually go to Hiroba Sushi but its good to change things up once in a while. Anyhow, the last time we went with our son and daughter while they were home from college. We went during the peak time. They set us in a corner and literally forgot about us.  We were busy talking so it wasn't a big deal...at first. I flagged down a waitress and asked for menus and water after 15 minutes or so. She was so busy she ran off after completing my requests. 15 minutes later we decided to leave and go down to the street to Hiroba. We walked out and were never asked why we were leaving or thanked for coming in. It was a surprise and we haven't gone back since. We had a great time that night, but not at I love Sushi."}
{"text":"We love this place. I have never had a bad experience. I've tried different rolls each time and haven't yet had one that I wasn't fond of. Fast, efficient service and presentation is a bonus.  Another BONUS: They give you hot towels to wipe your hands with at the start of your meal!   Extensive menu. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! A huge assortment of rolls. The servers are quick and friendly. The agadashi tofu is very good. If you want something filling and fusion, try the Grand Canyon roll."}
{"text":"I love it, she loves it, we love it. Everyone seems to love 'I love Sushi' (sorry Lucy).  A couple of years ago when gf san suggested this place I wasn't so sure. Eating sushi at a place called 'I love Sushi' in a shopping complex behind a gas station you say? Standby while I check my notes please. Sorry gf san, the answer is no. BUT I love sushi and I needed my fill so we tried it anyway. Since then this has become our go-to spot. We love the ambiance, we love the food and we love the kimono-wearing ladies cursing in Japanese (just kidding!).  The food's all good. While the sashimi isn't the best I've ever had, it's good enough. Their special rolls are delicious (not to mention creatively-named). The crunch roll and spicy tuna roll somehow always find their way into our order. The lunch specials are ok and I can honestly say I've had better bento box lunches. But if you're eating the bento here you're doing yourself a disservice. Have the real deal - the sushi and sashimi rolls. Finish off with the awesome green tea tempura icecream!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Even to-go orders are phenomenal! Love the huge dining room and variety of rolls! Every time I try a new sushi place, I end up comparing it to I Love Sushi and the latter always wins!"}
{"text":"Rainbow, Rock n Roll, Anthem, Bonsai, Sexy Time roll, Lisa roll, Salmon Lover, sashimi rolls with & without rice to name a few of my favorites!  I love the sashimi salads that are full of fresh fish & filling!    I am a regular at I Love Sushi & have ordered these rolls above numerous times.  The lady next to me ordered the MC Roll & it looked amazing so will definitely try that next time!  It had tempura halibut & she said it was her absolute fav!    Always friendly staff greets you, quickly to seats you & takes your drink order like clockwork.  I always sit at the sushi bar & order a sparkling water, which only comes in large, sake or wine. Whether you are on a time limit or not, they are always consistent, I have even been in & out of there in 20 minutes!    Lately, I've been to a couple sushi restaurants that never say 'arigato'.  I don't want that to go away ever that's part of the experience.  I love the whole wonderful sushi experience, even the small stuff.  Kanpai  8.10.16 Love these people that work here even more & tried the MC Roll as recommended earlier... AWESOME!  I wish I could give them more stars.   Thank you I Love Sushi!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the fact that it was reasonably priced for all you an eat sushi.   3 stars for the staffing who seemed uninterested and needed a calculator for 151 - 100  3 stars for decor ( the umbrellas from the ceiling, very cool )  Favorate roll: Crunchy Philly Roll"}
{"text":"So disappointed!!! I have to say. Tempura was over cooked and sashimi was not fresh! The service there make us really uncomfortable!!! The waitress warning us that if we can't finish the dishes, they will charge us 50 cents per \"piece\" when we are still eating! That's really bad! The table was sticky, the food was terrible. And what I need to mention they charge everything even one piece of chicken you can't eat in a buffet. What a terrible experience of eating! What a terrible business. I have to say I have never met such a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! The service was absolutely fantastic we will definitely be ditching our old sushi place."}
{"text":"I love this place.  This is the best place around.  Good food and the service is outstanding.   Try the Kitchen Sink , it's awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best sushi I've ever eaten it's always so fresh and delicious and the owners are  a delightful treat!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight and this place is awesome!! Everything was so good. The sushi was incredibly fresh and everything came out in a timely manner. I recommend the one night stand roll, definitely my new favorite roll! I love sushi came highly recommended and I'm so glad I finally tried it out! Already looking forward to coming back. Special thank you to our server, Hannah! Exceptional service!!"}
{"text":"Oh boy. This place needs help. Seeing the reviews I see i should have looked here before eating at I Love Sushi. As with any empty sushi place in Toronto around lunch time, you should turn around and leave. The only other people in the place were a young couple who relocated here from another town in Canada. The waitress was nice in the beginning, but you could tell by the way she would hang out at our table for too long that this might have been her first shift ever as a waitress. My girlfriend enjoyed her Edamame and her lunch special sushi rolls. She had no complaints other than the whacky service. My lunch, a salmon teriyaki bento box, was probably one of the worst I have ever had. The salmon actually looked frightening. To clarify, I did not say unappetizing, I said frightening. The tempura was a soggy mess. the california roll was disgusting and like no other california roll i have ever had. The salad was pretty good. The steamed rice was pretty good too! We asked for glasses of water. She brought one As we were leaving and we said, \"Thanks!, Bye\" She just looked at us with a blank expression and cleaned up our table."}
{"text":"Unbelievable rolls! Amazing service! And clean space! Love love love!  Try the green mussels they are so delicious. My husband and I are huge sushi lovers and have been to about every sushi spot in the city. This place is on the top of our list."}
{"text":"We went in with a party of 10, we had a great time. Service was excellent, food was fantastic! I recommend the Happy Ending sushi and chilled Raspberry Sake. We had a great giggle reading some of the names of the sushi on the menu."}
{"text":"Wow, tons of roll options! I also like that they have hand towels just like they do in Japan! We tried 3 things - we tried the #24 Hawaiian (Good), #27 I Love Sushi (Great) and #49 which was a Peppered Tuna Sashimi (I'd pass on this next time). I came back with my brother and sampled the Double D (Great!), Threesome (Great) and Kiss of Fire (Good). He also introduced me to their Special Sauce (a must get!) and Tempura (Vegetables) that we're great! They even have Mango Mochi ice cream balls!! They are great, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place!!! The rolls are creative and taste amazing every time. We love the atmosphere and friendly staff and quick service. We had our first date here and we come back every month to celebrate with sushi"}
{"text":"Very tasty and reasonable. The rolls are quite large with some odd names. The staff is very attentive and pleasant. I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"This spot had THE BEST sushi a few years ago. The management changed because none of the same people worked there anymore and the menu had also changed. Not to mention the cooks. The last 2 times I have been there my rolls have been warm like the rice wasn't cooled first. It was very mushy & the edamame was overcooked over and over again after I had asked many times that they cook it less because it's overdone. It's a shame because this used to be my all time favorite sushi spot! Bummer."}
{"text":"Loved \"I Love Sushi\"!  I went with a friend and everything we ordered was delicious!  When we first sat down we were immediately greeted and give some cucumber salad which was so good I wanted a bigger bowl of it but didn't want to fill up on it. We orders 4 rolls ( I wish I could remember the names) but each one was very good!  The names of their sushi rolls are very inventive/funny. I highly recommend this place. If you don't leave stuffed that's on you. I know I was beyond full but couldn't stop because it was so good."}
{"text":"The sushi here is excellent and service was quick and friendly. If you are a sushi lover, this is the place to go! Highly recommend the monkey roll."}
{"text":"BEST sushi place in town, hands down!!! The sushi is always fresh and grade A quality. It's always busy during dinner, cause it's the bomb diggidy!"}
{"text":"What a great place to come have sushi when you're in the area. We drove from downtown Las Vegas just to come here.  Loved the I love sushi special, screaming orgasm, and the yellow tail."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant about I Love Sushi when I saw the place but much to my surprise, it was some of the best and freshest sushi I have eaten in a long time.  It was nice to get off \"The Strip\" and find good sushi at a great price!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's not all you can eat but definitely worth the price. Their rolls are huge! I recommend the double d roll and Ryan's roll. The bacon wrapped shrimp is also a great starter."}
{"text":"2 hours of back and forth with just eat. Worst experience by far. Had an issue with my food order, waited one hour on the queue to speak to someone from a indian call centre and the person is absolutely ignorant and have no idea what the issue is or how to do their job! The just eat call centre employees work from home, while I'm explaining my issue with my order, I hear the just eat employees kids and husband in the background.   2 hours later, no food, just frustration!  Of course just eat blames the issue on the restaurant like always. Instead of taking the fault, they said the restaurant had made the mistake!  Don't order delivery from here. You won't get your food and you'll end up sitting there for 2 hours calling JUST EAT customer service which is located in India. And 2 hours later, you still won't get your food and no issue has been resolved. Except a fake apology from JUST EAT while the restaurant itself blames everything on just eat drivers."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my girlfriend and overall we had a great experience. One of my favorite food is sushi and I have been to many sushi joints. What makes this place awesome is how friendly is the staff. As soon you sit down at the sushi bar all the sushi chef greet you like they know you even though they never seen you in their lives. The chef recommended the Kiss of Fire and it was the best sushi roll I ever ate. Its not AYCE and it's a bit pricey but the fun festive atmosphere makes this place worth coming back to!!"}
{"text":"Seriously best sushi in town!  The only place I come :)  Amazing service and phenomenal sushi!"}
{"text":"I've had an amazing experience everytime I come here. The chefs are hilarious and the waitresses and bus boys are ON TOP of it! They're busy but it's controlled. My drink didn't go empty and my custom roll was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and atmosphere. We are here pretty often.  I love the udon, house salad, and pretty much everything. The oysters are excellent. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST sushi I have ever had - and the only sushi where I completely refuse to use Soy Sauce and Wasabi.  We always start with the Screaming Orgasm, then onto Tastes Like My Ex Girlfriend and finally Gary's special.  Sitting at the sushi bar is a fun experience, especially if you get the sushi chefs to do Saki Bombs complete with loud singing.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot ever!!!! Like I've mentioned in other sushi reviews, I love when they have a huge sushi menu and this place has MANY different rolls to try, it's fun!! I Love Sushi has at least 90!!! My husband and I's favorite is the Jackpot Special and we get it every single time we have dinner there. My friend was right about this place, the food and fish is very fresh!! If you're thinking about trying this place out, don't think twice, just go - you won't be disappointed. Get a good buzz going too, try their cold Raspberry sake. Btw, the service is good too!! They get pretty busy and packed during dinner time but it's usually not that long of a wait and it's always worth it to me.. The waitresses are very nice and the chefs are fun!  Update (I've tried and graded these rolls/dishes to my liking): *Jackpot - A+ *Boom Boom Nipple - A+ *Franky Special - A+ *Screaming Orgasm - A+ *Monkey Roll - A+ *Kiss of Fire - A+ *Bam Bam - A *Tastes Like My Ex-GF - A *John Homes - A *Double D - A *Japanese Lasagna - A *I Love Sushi - A *Something Wrong #69 - B+ *90% Special - B+ *Sun Devil - B+ *Sean's Special - B *Crazy Horse - B *Happy Ending - B- *Burning Your Stomach - B- *Garlic Butter Special - B-"}
{"text":"The name will speak for itself. You have to try the Sashimi Salad... tastes absolutely yummy!  As for the sushi... they have a complete variety. Too many to list. If you love sushi... check-it out!"}
{"text":"The reviews did not lie.. This place is awesome! Love that d tables by d sides are separated by walls for a lil privacy. Its my first time there tonight. I made reservations so we didnt have to wait long. They were busy but d servers were quick enough to bring our food. My step daughter never had rolls before and she said d spider roll was really yummy. Kiss of fire was actually spicy, unlike some other \"spicy\" rolls elsewhere. She also had chicken teriyaki n chicken katsu which were both good and great for d price. Will definitely come back! Im so glad this place is close to my house :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Vegas / Henderson area! If you go to Vegas take a trip to Henderson and try this spot! You won't regret it. And it's not a super expensive spot either! Which makes you eat more and try new rolls. Fun spot"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner since the yelp reviews were 4-star.  Figured we would try a new place but should have stayed with Sushi Factory across the street. Only 1 vegetable roll to choose from, & only 1 piece of it had avocado & no cucumber. I also ordered veggie tepan yaki - except the onion & there was lots of them, the rest was all green, not too visually appealing- put some variety in there.  The rice was served with the soup so definitely cold by the time my dinner was served & her combo dinner still took another 5-10 minutes. So really need better planning.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. Great ambiance, friendly staff and the food is so fresh. Best sushi place in Henderson"}
{"text":"First time eating sushi outside of a casino on a strong recommendation and great yelp reviews.   Now I know why.... Tuna, shrimp sushi and tiger roll just as good as the spots I go to.  Absolutely awesome!!!    The colorful manager James that seats people and runs around the place is worth the price alone. I will be back..."}
{"text":"Don't walk,run for the best sushi and service anywhere. No matter when you go, the sushi is the freshest, it melts in your mouth. They often have special items not on the menu, so ask your chef what they have. They also have fresh wasabi root that is grated if you ask for it. Everyone is friendly, from the chef, to the servers and the owner. We are always greeted when we walk in the door. We have friends and family that have eaten sushi across the US and they agree this is the best."}
{"text":"Use to be AMAZING. Then went completely downhill and became awful. Such a shame. Came here every toronto visit"}
{"text":"If you like Americanized special rolls, this place is definitely for you!  They have a large selection for specialty rolls.  Their rolls are creative.  I have been to quite a few sushi restaurants all over the States but this place had some rolls that I have never seen before.  All the fish tasted fresh and delicious.    They are a little pricier but they have a good service and pretty waitresses.  They have  a large sushi counter and can get packed easily.  We got to the restaurant at 5:30 and the place was already more than half full.  I would love to go back and try some other rolls next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"If yall want Japanese food in Henderson, this is the place. Delicious food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Great food and an amazingly helpful owner who will walk you through all of the food options for both newbies and veteran sushi eaters alike."}
{"text":"Checked out this place because of the Yelp reviews and it was close to my office. Did not disappoint!! Great service, on point suggestions from our waitress and everyone that walked in the door was treated like family! My new fav spot, for sure!!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in town.  A vast number of different rolls and other choices.  We are regulars and can alway count on their reliable service and food quality.  Plus they have a great beer and sake selection to get a little loose at dinner."}
{"text":"Great Sushi and great staff! We go there and see my favorite sushi chef... i don't know his real name, but we call him \"sexy buddah\" and he is quite the character! Favorite roll is \"almost 90% special\""}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm surprised by all the great reviews for this place. I will say, the service and the atmosphere are lovely, and very well done. The food itself is not great, and I found the quality of the fish to be poor. We ordered the Poke, the Screaming Orgasm, and an Eel Role. The Poke and  Screaming orgasm were inedible due to the poor quality of the fish. The roll was deep fried, and decent, however we decided not to risk anymore bad fish and move on with our evening. Still looking for a great sushi place in the area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place that I have been coming to consistently since 2003, the best sushi town in my opinion, love that most of the people working here are still the same people since I starting coming in 2003, great atmosphere, great sushi bar, this place is always great and never disappoints"}
{"text":"Amazing! Best sushi I have had in NV by far for the price. The fat ass special roll, candy cane roll and garlic tuna sushi were all soooo tasty. Great quality of fish. Also they served us completely frozen mugs with our beer and that made such a difference in the Kirin light. I would literally go back just to drink beer in glasses that cold. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"ILS is a great place to enjoy some sushi.  I went on a Friday night with six other people.  This was not a problem as reservations were made.  Good thing...this was a bumping place.  The parking slot was slammed and I was excited to people watch.  The people watching thing never happened as I discovered that there were many sushi options that were rice free (not sashimi) and thus my head was buried in plates of wonderful food."}
{"text":"From the first day I moved here I loved this sushi place. I'm a Cali kid- sushi is like a life necessity to me. I eat it at least 2x a week, at minimum, and I want only the good stuff. I love sushi does it for me. Their roles are great, services is on top of it (hot hand towel? don't mind if i do!), and the sushi chefs are friendly."}
{"text":"I Love Food Poisoning. I've spent the last 8 hours having the food from this restaurant violently exit my body."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! It has totally gone downhill. Prices are OUT OF CONTROL! $18.00 for two avocado rolls! Plus the owner is extremely rude!  Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!!!  The service was excellent, food delicious and they even gave me a Deep Fried Ice Cream for my Birthday!!!"}
{"text":"I Love Sushi is absolutely amazing!!  Favorite rolls:  -Washington roll -Gary's Special -Kiss of Fire  You have to order all 3 as they are amazinggg and the sushi chefs are fun too!"}
{"text":"Mediocre compared to a lot of the sushi all you can eats. The rice portions are much larger than usual, no sashimi, and service is slow. The mackerel is good, the rolls are too much rice."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 rolls online and was given only 2 tiny packets of soya sauce, when I called to have more delivered, they insisted I was given 4 packets , basically saying I was lying about Soya Sauce lol! The lady got rude when I was being so polite, then the phone was passed to some guy that spoke better English, and he was only able to send me 4 , and that it would take an hour to get the damn sauce lol. Apparently I needed to buy extra soya sauce to even get the correct amount lol, there are so many sushi places that deliver, definitely will never order from this one again. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love sushi, so when I had some free time in this neighborhood, I popped in. Love the interior, it's so intense it's almost on par with a theme restaurant, in a good way. The service was also really good, everyone was friendly and enthusiastic.  The food was kind of hit or miss though. Got a few orders of nigiri and loved the cut: long, thick, generous slices and a great rice ratio. But the texture and flavor seemed to indicate that the fish was recently defrosted.   The rolls are the way to go here, and the popular Washington roll is awesome. I like that they have a variety of riceless rolls, but the Cherry Blossom just tasted off- maybe the oil was old, but the soft shell crab did not taste fresh and something in the roll was extremely peppery and offputting. Would give them another try, since they seem to usually be pretty great, but the actual food did not live up to expectations on my visit."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in Vegas.   They are always packed but they are very efficient.   To beat the crowd, try to come in before the rush hour usually lunch or dinner time.    The waitresses are always very friendly.   But most importantly, the food comes out very quick."}
{"text":"There are many sushi restaurants in town that are pretty good, but it's rare to find one with excellent food and great ambience.  All the waitresses are dressed in kimonos and the inside is decorated in a way that makes you feel like your in Asia. The food is even better than the ambience.  A couple menu items I would recommend off the bat is the oyster shooter and the toro.  It may be pricey but it's definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh sushi with some good rolls. A little more expensive than it should be, and a bad location for how far away I am, but a great gem for those closer to this side of town!"}
{"text":"Solid Sushi Spot in Henderson one of my favorite sushi rolls called the Johnny roll which is crab and cucumber wrapped in cucumber which is amazing the other is the jackpot roll that has these little flakes that make it crunchy and super tasty very good I would highly suggest anybody trying it. Rainbow roll is very fresh very good all of their sushi rolls are incredibly fresh and really tasty. The only downside to this place is that it's a way off the beaten path so you Gotta really want to go to it!"}
{"text":"It's Friday and my son was craving sushi, so I ordered ahead and picked up a Dragon Roll and Gary's Special.  The Dragon Roll is a California roll with eel and eel sauce on top.  I was cracking up because my son was eating the eel first, and then popping the rest in his mouth.  He loved it!  Gary's Special is a plethora of goodness, starting with spicy soft shell crab, spice tuna,  spicy crab, spicy scallop, and if that's not enough it's topped with yellowtail and salmon.  OMG.  My poor son, we were all digging in and trying this one.  Quick tip:  when you get it to-go, the sauce is served separately in a little plastic container (I love that!  Keeps thing from getting soggy).  Be sure to mix it up good, because I didn't and had too much oil, while my husband had the foresight to mix it up better and enjoyed a citrus note.  Although I Love Sushi is not an AYCE joint, it has some mighty fine sushi and a really nice variety of specialty rolls.  And, since it's right around the corner it's a favorite neighborhood place.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was insufficient and the food was okay. Not worth going out of your way to go to this place. Good enough to fill your belly. But the it is an ayce place. Can't expect haute cuisine."}
{"text":"\"I love Sushi\" should be changed to \"I love variety\" instead.  While I love sushi does offer the traditional nigiri, this place offers way too much rolls that it's almost mind boggling. And the only reason why their rolls are so big is because pack in a lot of rice. The quality of their seafood/fish isn't bad, but I wouldn't say it's good either. It isn't the freshest I've ever had. For the times I've been here, it's always pretty packed and service is ok.  Suggestion: to simplify the menu, instead of naming each roll a different name, maybe it should be called one name and put alternative ingredients underneath each name as suggestions of how you can build your sushi...OR if you keep each name, put it by type of ingredients so I don't have to go on searching for specific rolls that have i.e. shrimp tempura, or one's with philly cheese because there is too many freakin' rolls to go through and read. Ai yi yi....  Bottom line: Don't think this place is really worth going to considering all that I've said + it's pretty pricey for a place that offers mediocre fish. I also suspect that this place isn't run by or is guided by someone of Japanese decent just by the way the rolls are prepared/served...."}
{"text":"Always consistent. Sashimi is cut for perfect mouth feel. The takeout presentation is plated well."}
{"text":"I love I love sushi! I've tried sashimi salad everywhere and I really like this one, could be the dressing which is all homemade. I can't stand when salads come with bottled dressings, it's obvious to me, the taste is different. Anyway we really have only had sashimi salad and a couple rolls which were excellent. There are always lots of people here every time I've ever gone. The sushi chef \"Boom Boom\" was hilarious and super friendly and nice. He made us a special roll and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a solid NON AYCE sushi place in Henderson. The service was spot on throughout and our waitress was very sweet and personable. The fish was high quality and the rolls were reasonably priced. We were AYCE status stuffed and the bill was only $60 pre tip and that included a large Sapporo.  We started of with steamed Gyoza that were around $5 and edamame. For our rolls we opted for Rainbow roll, scallop roll, screaming orgasm roll, and an assortment of nigiri (salmon, yellowtail and scallop). The fish was very fresh and the rolls were not overloaded with yum sauce or cream cheese. The place does get packed in the evenings during dinner rush.   Keep in mind, there is no AYCE option here, but the quality of the food and the great service that accompanies it warrants paying the regular prices."}
{"text":"I am so proud I stumbled into this restaurant while I  was celebrating closing on a house for a dear friend. The fresh fish and delicious rolls made with their own special sauces made this special occasion that much more special:)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant. I go here with my family probably once a month. So good! I recommend Tastes Like My Ex-girlfriend and Something Wrong # 69. Nummers.  The service is fast. Sometimes almost too fast. Hard to explain that one... I guess sometimes it's nice to have the rolls brought out more gradually.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very good and very fresh. There was 4 of us for dinner and the service was fantastic along with all the food. If you love sushi, then yes......go"}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in town! I'd recommend the Gary or DC roll are my favorites. Fresh and always excellent!"}
{"text":"Great sushi at I Love Sushi. Love the atmosphere of the restaurant, great seating options weather alone or with a group. I'm shorting them one star because they're a little spendy ... I'd eat their more often if they'd shave a dollar off here and there. Either way, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to I Love Sushi a couple times and am not disappointed.  I had been looking for a sushi place after moving to the Henderson area.  My favorite rolls are the caterpillar and kitchen sink - both with no rice.  I will be recommending this place to all my Henderson friends."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi spot. You must try the screaming orgasm, the I love sushi special roll, and the Grand Canyon roll. There are many others that are just as fabulous. The menu is huge- you could order something different every time. Service is great. Prices reasonable. Since finding this place I don't go anywhere else for sushi."}
{"text":"Tonight I was all about Sake bombs, Poki, and Asahi. I Love Sushi has it all ranging from the basic spicy tuna to custom rolls. It's been my favorite sushi restaurant since 2007 and has never gotten old."}
{"text":"I have had sushi all over the world and this restaurant still serves as my sushi benchmark. There are some restaurants I can think of that may come close but I have yet to try a restaurant that serves better quality and better tasting sushi rolls. I recommend the garlic edamame as an appetizer and the Spring Mountain and Cherry Blossom Rolls."}
{"text":"Good to know locals. . . It was 5 of us. . .the resto seemed to pretty packed for dinner. The names of the sushi rolls were pretty appealing to Vegas. ..screaming orgasam, i love sex. . .the list goes on and on. . . The food was great! SUSHI is my fave food! WE had a bunch of different rolls. . . we even had 2 full rolls left over! We also ordered my fave. . .hamachi. . .yellowtail sashimi. . .the cut of the hamachi was HUGE and thick. . . Even though its a drive from the strip. . .it was worth it."}
{"text":"I love sushi is the best sushi in town as far as rolls and speciality items. I've been going here for years now and they have always been consistent. You do not come here for nigiri! This place is not all you can eat for a reason. Their sushi quality is always top notch and their rolls are what they are known for here. Some sushi roll recommendations of mine are the kitchen sink, screaming orgasm with salmon, one night stand, Sean special, Frankie's special, and jackpot. The hamachi Kama here is also amazing. This is not a place you go to for \"quantity\" if you're a huge AYCE fan and simply want nigiri then this isn't for you. If you want bomb ass sushi rolls and the best screaming o in town then come here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick couple rolls the other night with the wife. I'm slightly picky when it comes to sushi, only liking a few types of fish, but 2 out of the 3 things we ordered were pretty amazing. I don't use that word lightly either.  The Screaming Orgasm was awesome, the flavors and textures going on worked very well together, and the fish was super fresh and smooth.  The MC roll was also really good I would highly recommend it.   Also, another plus, two small (12oz) Sapporo's were only $7"}
{"text":"This place did not live up to the hype I heard from multiple people and yelp reviews. The atmosphere is nothing special and the sushi was ok. I had spicy tuna and the screaming orgasm and even though the screaming orgasm was what one would think is a \"specialty roll\" it was honestly just average. Maybe I should've ordered different items but I did not love it."}
{"text":"Very good service and the food was delicious! Katsu chicken was the best we've ever had and the sauce was legit. I tried the happy ending which is amazing if you like baked rolls.   Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I don't eat meat so I'm constantly looking for a good sushi place just in case I don't have time to cook at home and this place hit the spot perfectly! I always get the super white tuna and it's one of the best I've ever tasted. It was so good that I spent $75 worth of food all to myself. I got a few rolls, one hand roll, 4 nigiris and their crab fried rice. They were all so delicious! I would definitely come back again only this time with a few more people."}
{"text":"Well damn!!!!! What in the hell was I waiting for??? I've passed by this place several times but never stopped in to try it. So glad I stopped in this particular day. What a nice surprise. Great customer service, atmosphere and excellent sushi. There were a large variety of sushi selections. I ordered the Jackpot roll with screaming orgasm sauce. OMG!!!!! So delicious. I also ordered a house salad and another roll (that I can't remember the name of). I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've had their takeout sushi about ten times. It is always reliably good-- above average."}
{"text":"I Love Sushi is on the extreme opposite end of town for me, but I was in the area last night and I thought it would be a good time to drop in and see what all the Yelping is about.  Right away I was very impressed with the atmosphere and the decor.  It is very fun and modern with Japanese paper lanterns hung about and nice artwork and booths.  I was immediately seated at the sushi bar.  The sushi chef recommended the Washington Roll for me and it was exactly what I was wanting with salmon on the outside of the roll and salmon on the inside of the roll.  The salmon is so incredibly fresh and tastes like butter.  A little splash of soy and wasabi...ahhhh.  I followed that with two pieces of Maguro Tuna.  It was a very nice meal.  It's a fun atmosphere and there was a lot of interesting people there.  If I am on that side of town again I will definitely drop in.  It was a lovely experience."}
{"text":"I have been to I Love Sushi many times. I always try to go with someone who is more knowledgeable about ordering sushi than I am. This time I went with my adult daughter, who frequently eats sushi in LA, her home. When it came time to order, I prevailed on her to go with a \"boat.\" We ordered the sushi boat for 2 with 3 of us eating. The meal started with miso soup and a small salad - both tasty. The portion of food in the boat was huge, more than enough food for 3, with a nice variety of sushi and sashimi. Everything tasted fresh. The service was attentive despite the restaurant being very crowded and all the tables full. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I love I Love Sushi! Their prices are very reasonable and their service is outstanding. They are attentive without being pushy, and your glass never comes close to being empty. I had a dinner special with beef rib eye teriyaki and tonkatsu. The rib eye was perfectly cooked and tender, the tonkatsu was breaded and fried so it wasn't overly crisy, and the pork was juicy. The salad, miso soup, and gyoza that was included was excellent as well. The coolest thing about their dinner special was their tempura rice. I have never seen anything like it and i was pleasantly surprised when i bit into it. The rolls my GF ordered were tightly rolled and filled with delicious raw cuts of fish and the sashimi she ordered was nicely cut and very fresh.   It doesn't get any better that I Love Sushi for your sushi fix in vegas. The only thing that could possibly make this place better is an \"all you can eat\" option."}
{"text":"I blame I Love Sushi for making me the sushi snob that I've become. I refuse to eat sushi anywhere else... my friends have tried to force other restaurants down my throat and each time I've been highly disappointed that I wasted my money on such sub par crap! I've pretty much had everything on their extensive sushi menu. Service is always fast and friendly....as a reg. customer I always feel like a celebrity when I dine there. Hands down the best sushi I've eaten, ever!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants in town! We prefer to drive here despite having other sushi restaurants that are closer to us. Our favorites are the Jackpot, Kitchen Sink & baked lobster. They've recently changed owners, this owner is just as friendly as the previous and nothing seemed to change which is great. The servers are very friendly and our patient with our messy and loud infant. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because they should have an AYCE option!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Henderson. Great food. Good service. Clean. Worth the money. The chefs are funny too as is the menu."}
{"text":"They offer brown rice sushi! And the spicy tuna is so fresh, it melts in your mouth. I like this place :)"}
{"text":"this place rocks. great prices great service. awesome food, not just the sushi either, the whole menu looks great. my favorites are the jackpot roll, shrimp bacon maki, and fresh wasabi, it costs a dollar more but is definatly worth it! and dont forget to save room for mochi, they serve it at the perfect temperature too!  I LOVE \"I LOVE SUSHI\" !"}
{"text":"This was the first sushi place i went to after i moved out here.  It is pretty good, always crowded.  my fav. is the cherry blossom!  that is my every time visit must!  the service for the most part has always been pretty standard, only on once occasion was is a little poor...  i have not been here in a few months, but will be back soon!"}
{"text":"All of the rolls we had were amazing! Had the California Roll, Threesome, and Tiger Roll.  All were great! Especially because I like sushi but I don't want like shark fin eel in my sushi.  #whitegirlproblems.  Anyway, really enjoyed the place. Had great service, super fast, and such crazy names for the dishes :D"}
{"text":"So many choices of sushi rolls.  Fast and friendly service.  The restaurant was very busy, we were seated within 10 minutes.  All the food was very good."}
{"text":"I have never been here when it hasn't been busy.  They have A LOT of fresh fish options, which my man really likes, while I like the cream cheesy kind of things....  THEY HAVE BOTH!  The seating isn't really that thought out, and can get crowded, uncomfortable and loud.... that's really the only bummer."}
{"text":"The sushi here is delicious, and the atmosphere is fun, as well. Not sure how I feel about waitresses wearing kimonos, though:)  I usually like to stick with nigiri (tuna, salmon) and basic rolls like spicy tuna and salmon skin. This place makes everything meld together so perfectly, I always try a new roll with a porn-inspired name when I'm here. (Tastes like my ex-girlfriend, anyone?)   Solid place."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Vegas IMHO! Service is great sushi is even better. They have around 90 different sushi rolls you can order with outrageous names. If you are craving sushi and have not been this is difinitely worth a drive"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, and wonderful food! What more could we ask for? Loved the shrimp hibachi, and kimchi roll. They went out of their way to give us a magnifying glass to read the small menu too!!"}
{"text":"The staff on duty when I went there for dinner were very attentive. I didn't go very long without a full cup of tea and the food came out quickly. I do wish that they spent a  little more time focusing on the preparation as the dishes we got were subpar.   The sushi chefs do not appear to have received any formal training in any aspect of sushi making. I'm by no means an expert but damn, it looked like they just threw together whatever was within reach and wrapped it in nori. The soup noodles were greasy for some reason, and everything that came off the grill was swimming in teriyaki sauce.   I don't expect perfection. I mean this is an AYCE joint after all, but the quality of the food and the skill of the chefs is borderline embarrassing.  It almost seems that the  owners either don't know or don't care to offer anything more than the absolute minimum. This place needs to shut down for a few weeks and train their staff on the basics. If that doesn't work then call it quits."}
{"text":"No. Just no.   Making a new profile to hide the terrible reviews that you previously received is pretty lame. And whoever it was that have this place 5 stars needs to eat a bag of d's. But they'll probably give that 5 stars too.   Seriously eff this place and their terrible food. Zero quality control, poor technique, teriyaki sauce on all the things."}
{"text":"Excellent!  The food was excellent.  Great service.  The portions were nice for the price.  My wife and I had sashimi while my father and boys had combo meals. The meals had very large portions.  Particularly with the tempura.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love Love this place!!! So wish they had the AYCE.  The food is always fresh and amazing.  Lasagna roll is the best.  Jackpot special and the grand canyon roll very good also."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Henderson and perhaps all of Vegas. The decor is aesthetically pleasing, the waitresses are lovely and remember your orders if you're a frequent customer, and the service overall is speedy and organized. And the sushi. Good lord, the sushi. The menu ranges from simple, elegant rolls to the more decadent style and they're all amazing. There are a lot of really creative flavor combinations that I haven't really experienced elsewhere. I've never had a bad roll here. The ingredients are always fresh and flavorful as well. Always a wonderful experience here. Don't miss out on the screaming orgasm, the one night stand roll, and the tempura ice cream. It's all lovely."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the udon noodle and jackpot special roll ... We usually come here with friends and family ."}
{"text":"This place is in a store front of a strip mall but make NO mistake about it the sushi is extremely Tasty.  We ordered the sushi boat for two and we couldn't finish it.  The staff is very friendly and attentive. Definitely a stop ALL the time I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and decided to try this place because of the reviews.  The food was excellent and we felt it was a lot of food for the price - great quality, great value, fun atmosphere.  We'd come back anytime!"}
{"text":"As they say here, 'I love Sushi' and I live this place! Our waitress Bo was amazing and hilarious and on top of this the sushi is also amazing. Fresh fish, but note that if you get there late there is a chance that they will run out of things like the Fatty Salmon or Tuna Belly!   They have a large selection of rolls also if that's what you're looking for, but def come for the sushi and staff. This place is a solid 4, but I'll give the 5th star for the service cause she was A-Mazing!"}
{"text":"If only I didn't live so far from this place I would go here all the time. Love their screaming O it's literally the best I've tried. Their selection is great, great fresh quality 100%. Atmosphere is good too. Overall a really good place to eat quality sushi. Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Americanized sushi doesn't always translate well. For the sake of clarity, I've translated my review of I Love Sushi into Japanese then back into English using an online translator.  Here it is in Japanenglish:  \"I went to I love sushi where 2 friends have been attached, but we received just one menu. As for me I that because I am the food central, yelpers service and atmosphere of the restaurant, and so on remainder when it adjusts the focus, must say that the fact that you make be irritated is found: As for bad service it was and others, but was to let stand and the food left, if you blow, me everything is directly forgotten. As for me the weight less failure which gives three menus to us with such reason so presumes that you make be irritated -- The fish of I love sushi the good quality, but what approximately obtains your panty of the bundle, is.  \"In addition as for me when the place of the sushi the wind change giving name in the roll, that like the characteristic roll of the destruction of duplication Doggstyle rather than being lovely, the margin which is rubbed the fact that you are troubled is found. But because I at all do not think the possession some kind of fish and the raw materials form the DDBS roll, but for failing the trial of the restaurant which gives the impact which is not, enjoys. And these retardedly of the menu it seems like 200 of the roll which is shown, therefore I order to speaking to my friend exactly, description finish the fact that book-reading of 30 parts is used in the change which is obtained. When you think plus, that we would like to inspect the characteristic position which has sexual intercourse don't I go exactly with Internet? You do not entreat the sushi pornography exactly.  \"... Way me it elapses in grasping in detail from the food itself concerning restaurant problem, domesticated fowl and animals raw...You see. How am every [wa] am I? This examination does not have to be read! I inhale!  \"And the food is good exactly. Star of two 1/2. Go somewhere.\"   And here it is in regular-old English:  \"I went to I Love Sushi with two friends, but the waitress only gave us one menu. I have to say I find it irritating when yelpers focus too much on a restaurant's service, ambience, etc, because I'm food-centric: bad service is frustrating, but all is soon forgotten if the food blows me away. I guess that's why the waitress' failure to give us 3 menus was so vexing -- the fish at  I Love Sushi is of an ok-quality, but nothing to get your panties in a bunch about.   \"I also find it annoying rather than cute when Sushi places give their rolls wacky names, like Double Doggstyle Breakup Sex Roll. But not because of the restaurant's failed attempts to shock and amuse, but because I have no fucking idea what kind of fish and ingredients make up a DDBS Roll. And there's like 200 of these retardedly-named rolls on the menu, so I end up spending a half-hour reading the descriptions instead of just ordering and getting back to talking to my friends. Plus, if I wanted to check out fucked-up sexual positions wouldn't I just go on the internet? Sushi-porn just ain't appealing.  \"...Oh shit...looks like I've lapsed into griping more about the restaurant than the food itself. What a shit I am! Don't read this review! I suck!  \"And the food is just ok. 2 1/2 stars. Go somewhere else.\"  Why can't Japanese food be more...JAPANESE????"}
{"text":"Ordered sushi for lunch take out. Was expecting good sushi due to the reviews but it was just so-so. And the green onions which were garnish for our Joes Special roll were spoiled and smelled bad. Fish was not chilled so sushi did not taste fresh. Did not care for it."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2. It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here."}
{"text":"I think we had a home run on this place are 1st day as an official Henderson resident. The food was fantastic the service was friendly and authentic. I think this will be a once a week kind of place for us. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place ALWAYS impresses, ask for Joe if you want the best Sushi Chef there. You can order from the menu or tell Joe what you like and get the Joe Special"}
{"text":"Yes, This place is that good!   Great service, excellent dinner.  Great price.   Check out the Rock N Roll.  They also offer Soy paper which is great too.  Check this place out, but be prepared for a small wait on busy nights."}
{"text":"The three stars are for the food. The meals are well prepared and the rolls are terrific. One small fault is you're handed a card to choose which roles you want to order but there is really no description. You have to ask your waitress which tends to be tedious. Now for the bad. Like many of these Asian restaurants they seem in a hurry to Get you in and out as fast as possible. This one you can expect on occasion to get your main meal first then your appetizer or both togeather. The meals don't come out all at once but are on a when ready schedule. Therefore your companion could be finishing their meal when yours is on its way out. If you accept the erratic service then you'll like this place."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, welcoming immediately. comfortable decor and reasonably priced. 4 of us celebrate in for a late lunch, 9 rolls plus appetizer came out to about 25$ each and I was stuffed to the gills. A great variety. will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Vegas! I had the tiger roll, screaming o, a bunch of other rolls and the Lisa hand roll. The Lisa hand roll is my favorite but everything is delicious. The staff and owner are very friendly and efficient. Its more expensive compared to other sushi spots but def worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets, period. Every time I visit Vegas I take my 20 min drive from the strip and visit this restaurant. They Sushi is amazing. Do yourself a favor and come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Note that this place is NOT anywhere near the strip... but we happened to be out in the area for a soccer tournament and went here based on a recommendation from a friend.   My friend and I got 3 things to share. (My apologies, I do not remember the names.)  1. Pepper Tuna - By far the BEST pepper tuna I've ever had. Its super peppery, but sooo good. It comes with a really great sauce that you just want to drink. LOL  2. Salmon wrapped around avocado - No rice. -- I'm not usually a salmon fan, but this dish was really good. The salmon was fresh and melted in your mouth.   3. Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice - I've had this before at several other places... you cant really mess it up. The rice cake was nice and crispy and they top it with sriracha and a sliced jalapeno.   YUM.  I really enjoyed this place and would totally go back. We are out that way for our soccer tournament every April... so we will definitely be back.   GO HERE!"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review!! I never felt the need to review a business before, but this time, I had to. I lost my Chanel wallet, which is worth around $1,300. I called I love Sushi to check if maybe I left it there. They told me that they had it, and returned it with everything in it! I cannot explained how happy I was. BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!. Thank you, I Love Sushi for being so awesome"}
{"text":"Decent sushi with some unique rolls on the menu, somewhat expensive. We ordered the screaming orgasm, Mexican roll, lobster roll, kimchi roll, baked green mussels and fried gyoza. The food was good, nothing overly impressive. A lot of spicy dishes, felt a bit like a Korea/sushi fusion type of restaurant. The screaming orgasm was very spicy and its sauce wasn't as creamy as I usually like it. I really enjoyed the kimchi roll most. The mussels were a tad dry. The place itself was packed, we ended up waiting 30 minutes for a table and the loud noise from so many people crowded in such a small space made it difficult to relax and converse. The decorations created a nice atmosphere with a lot of red and black, paper screens and painted lanterns. Staff was friendly and our waitress was spectacular despite the crowd - great attitude, on top of our drinks, and kept track of what food we were still waiting on better than I could. Overall, a good experience and, although it won't be my go-to sushi place, I would go back again."}
{"text":"Just came back from ordering Pad Thai from this place and its god awful. I'll never come back here not only was the the Noodles not actual Pad Thai it lacked flavour and the noodles weren't actual vermicelli noodles."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Sushi place!  I wish they had all you can eat because the specialty rolls get kind of expensive.  But everything is great, fresh, lots of choices, service is friendly and usually pretty fast! Love it here!"}
{"text":"The best sushi rolls in Henderson! Try the Taste Like My Ex-Girlfriend. Awesome!"}
{"text":"We tried tons of Japanese restaurants here then one day my sister introduced us here when my daughter and I crave for sushi now this place is always on top of our list whenever we crave for Japanese food! We love the menu they serve and we eat a lot whenever we get a chance to eat here. We always ask to be seated in the bar area for us to be seated right away. But it's always pack so expect to wait for a few minutes."}
{"text":"This place is way to fun.  Whenever I'm in Vegas it's a must to go to I Love Sushi.  I recommend the I Love Sushi roll.  It's seriously the best. and also I recommend to sit at the sushi bar ONLY if your seated with BOOM.  He the craziest sushi chef probably ever. He even has a video on yourtube of how crazy he is.  The atmosphere is great, the sushi is great and the chefs are AWESOME.  Also ask if you can hit the gong.  That is always fun..."}
{"text":"Alright! Off season is officially over. I'm all settled in Vegas. It's time to get back to some good ole fashioned reviewing. I've got a lot of places to review but what better place to start than \"I Love Sushi\" because anyone that knows me, knows that I really LOVE sushi more than anyone!  Cozily located in a strip mall in Henderson, I Love Sushi is one of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas, on or off the strip. The place is always bumping and the staff is always friendly. Although some of the roll names are less than desirable (example: Tastes Like Your Ex Girlfriend...) TMI and very SCARY DUDE! Not partaking in that one right off the bat, no offense! I'd use more examples but I am unable to find a copy of their heavily sexual connotated menu online. Poking fun at their menu's items is like fishing from a barrel.  I recommend starting off with the oyster shooters. I order mine minus the quail egg. For those that are into the whole Rocky raw egg thing, have at it! You might want to even ask for my discarded ones as I've certainly discarded enough of them, although I can't guarantee they'll hook that up. Their oyster shooters set the mood quite nicely for date night. Gotta love those aphrodisiacs! Yum yum!  I typically am a creature of habit when it comes to ordering sushi so I don't mean to bore anyone after this point. I love the Philly Roll + asparagus. Even better is their \"spicy ponzu sauce\" option which is not offered elsewhere at most other sushi bars.  All in all, this place is one of the good ones. It's about as unpretentious as it gets and the quality is as good if not better as that that can be found at many of the high end strip sushi bars, without the lofty price tags. My name is Bobbi Billard and I approve of this message. I'm on a mission to become the Duchess of this restaurant... Stay tuned."}
{"text":"I was looking for an all you can eat in my area and found this one. The food is not bad at all. The fish was warm which is not preffered. It was still tasty but I've had better. The hot appetizers were delicious and do was the seafood fried Ramen noodles! The service was quick but they did not clear all the empty dishes until the end which is not good at all. Can't go wrong fir $16 including tax for lunch. For that price at SUSHI 2 GO you get one roll ..."}
{"text":"Sushi was great quality and service felt top notch. The server was very attentive and followed up to ensure satisfaction. We tried 2 specialty sushi rolls - both delicious. It helped that sauce was presented on the side so you can choose how much. I would recommend and visit again!"}
{"text":"I love sushi made me skeptical at first because of the name of the business, but when I actually tried it it was actually really good.  Solid quality sushi, not top notch but for the price it is really good. I recommend their lunch specials before 3pm which includes two rolls for $6.50 or 3 rolls for $8.50. If you are going for dinner I recommend the curry chicken bento or the garlic angus beef bento, these are in the $9-11 range."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. One of my favorites, if not my very favorite, sushi place in Vegas.  The atmosphere is awesome, with a cordial staff dressed in cute, themed clothes. The prices are reasonable, for sushi. There are many unique options, and every item comes perfectly prepared, often with an interesting design. And EVERYTHING is delicious.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"i eat here a lot. favorite rolls: kiss of fire, sun devil, and something wrong. everything is good here though"}
{"text":"My Favorite Local Sushi Place on the East side. I Love Sushi is always on the tongue of my friends when we are craving some raw goodness. You can always get fresh sushi here, and they have a really extensive menu of fun rolls and dishes. I love the screaming orgasm, yes, this is what its called, I know.  Its yummy ahi tuna with a nice sauce over little cellophane noodles. The place is always pretty busy and I try to go at non peak hours...(read: super late lunch as I always do) so the service is quick.  This is not a super discount sushi place nor is it crazy expensive. I like this in the middle feeling."}
{"text":"Got takeout here last night for the first time. The reception lady was very friendly and the good was great! We had noodles, edamame, rice, veggie tempura, and three rolls for under $50. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. The salmon was fresh. I got the Grand Canyon roll and wasn't a fan of that. I would probably come back."}
{"text":"Bomb af! Food came in fast which is always a plus and was magically delicious. Finished all of it and my stomach went from 0 to 100 real quick. The waitress was on top of her shiet! Always checked on us and always came through with that we needed. I almost wanted to call her \"bae\". In addition to that the atmosphere of the place made me feel asian af, and I love that. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Like sushi? You better get down here and give this place a try.. The atmosphere is great. They have some of the best sushi at this place with the wildest names..  Every time I go here I like to try different rolls. I'll give just about anything a try once.. I like to order the what's your name and crunch roll. The xxx is also great.. My wife swears by there avacado roll since she doesn't like fish..  Every time I go here I have a great time except for my wallet, that's the only thing that hurts after this place..."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants in town. Fish is fresh. Roll are delicious. Ambiance is nice. My personal favorite rolls are double d, rock and roll (no rice), salmon lover (no rice), screaming orgasm (no rice) but everything thing I've tried there has been good."}
{"text":"So many have said this is the best sushi!! Ok the ambience is great....food not so great.  Had 3 rolls and 3 orders of sushi between 2 of us.  None of the rolls we had had a wow factor...one tasted like fish bait and they all tasted fishy.  Fishy equals not fresh!  Still hands down the best is The Sushi in Henderson.....Learned my lesson....would not go to I Love Sushi again. Menu great, ambience great....food blech :("}
{"text":"Wow!!! Still the best in town. Great food, great service,  great atmosphere. I absolutely think this is the best place for sushi in town."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Been going here for a few years now and never been disappointed. Great sushi, great service, and nice atmosphere. Some of my favorites are the screaming orgasm, threesome special, burn in your stomach, and tastes like my ex girlfriend. These are some I can remember but they really do have a great selection.  Would definitely recommend sushi lovers to try this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. May be a little far from the strip but one of the best sushi places I been. Gotta get the stuffed tomato roll btw"}
{"text":"The food here is impeccable and the ambiance is very nice. Halibut is always on point and the salmon skin hand roll is delish. These guys know how to do sushi right!"}
{"text":"If you are ever in Vegas and you are hungry for sushi.  Drive to Henderson. And go here.  The rolls are awesome.  We made reservations. Thank goodness.  It was packed, and for good reason.  I love the names of the rolls. Screaming Orgasm, Washington DC, One Night Stand, and so many more.  Every sauce they use, so delish.  Cant wait to come back to Vegas and go here."}
{"text":"Fantabulous!    I come from South Florida. I'm a native of Florida.   So we move to the desert, and I read the yelp reviews and it's only one mile from our house.  Wow!  The freshest and most original menu I've ever had.  I've been to Tokyo twice, and I have to say this is as good if not better.   I've just become a regular. Staff excellent.   Don't miss great sushi in the desert. Whoooooooo Aaahhhhhhh!"}
{"text":"What a surprise, driving into Vegas from LA and craving sushi we turned to Yelp and found this place.  Everything was really great, fresh and tasty sushi.  We will go again.  The building is in a strip mall near a residential neighborhood so dont expect great decor."}
{"text":"Amazing service, good food! Some of the best Customer service I've had in a while! Friendly welcoming and had good recommendations!! Dragon roll was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi but horrible service. I've been to this place over 20 times and at least half  the time the service was horrible. They need to train their people better."}
{"text":"The food atmosphere and staff is very good. They are friendly and have fast service. The sushi rolls are always good. We got the James Bond and the Double D. The Double D was just enough spice. Our mouths were not burning at all. I will definitely go again. Next time I'm getting the California roll."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner on a Saturday night with some friends.  I have heard things from friends here and there and I like to try new sushi spots, so I decided to give this a go from that as well as Yelp reviews.  -;)  No reservations and we were still able to get a party of 8 seated in about 10 minutes at 8 PM on a Saturday night, which was fantastic.  The older Asian man in the embroidered cowboy shirt and riding boots was nice and efficient.  We ordered after much debate (and apparently a menu-stealing waitress from what a friend said) and the food came pretty fast.  That might be relative to enjoying great company with friends, I'm not 100%.  Their Homare Strawberry Nigor (strawberry sake) is $16 a bottle - not bad as Island Sushi's is $20.  I drank most of it.  (Hey, it was my birthday dinner.)  I got two staples in my sushi ordering - crunch roll and dragon roll.  Both were good but not the best I've had.  The crunch on the crunch roll was not what I'm used to - it was fairly hard and not the normal light, panko batter that I've experienced at other places.  The dragon roll had a bit too much sauce, but the eel slices on top were generous.  My friend ordered a spicy roll with a jalapeno slice on top (can't remember the name) so we sushi-swapped and hers was great!  I had to eat one roll in two bites.  They are VERY generous with the fish cuts, which is great because they are also high-quality.  The tempura I tried from my friend's Love Boat was good but slightly reminded me of my crunch roll - that harder crunch instead of the light fluff of normal panko.  Service was very friendly and they brought out a complimentary tempura ice cream with a candle.  That was very tasty - the pound cake inside was soft, fluffy, and very melt-in-your mouth - but I was pretty full by that point so I only ate half.  Plus: LOTS of cooked choices for groups that enjoy Japanese food but not sushi. (Those crazies.)  Minus: No AYCE.  I came with an AYCE-friendly group, and since they are my normal sushi crew I probably won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough about this place.  The sushi chefs are awesome and they will make you anything you ask for.  The fish is always fresh and yummy.  I like going there because they remember us and know what we like.  Plus if you are undecided they will create some special just for you.  Fantastic service and great food.  Best sushi joint we have ever eaten at."}
{"text":"I grew up very close to this place and somehow never managed to stop by until a recent trip back to Vegas. After eating there I seriously regret not having taken advantage of this gem. Service was spectacular. They were polite and very fast. The food was equally great. I usually don't trust sushi from places far from the coast, but the fish was very fresh and flavorful. Huge variety of rolls, all moderately priced. The crunch roll and spicy salmon roll were very filling. I will definitely return here whenever I come back to town."}
{"text":"Ate there a few months ago with another couple. Food was veggie dish. The dish was almost 60 % onions. Told server and her only response was sorry. Told he manager on the way out. He said sorry. Nothing off the bill but told me  to let him know next time we came in and he would take care of an item.  NO thanks. Won't be back.  If you are looking for Japanese try the South Point casino."}
{"text":"Downright disgusting. It's challenging to imagine that anyone could be in business at this revolting level. Fish was soggy and beyond prime, rice was a watery mess, 'tempura' was a burnt crispy hell of grease.  When I called to complain the \"manager\" who wouldn't give his name hung up. BEWARE - this is the bottom of the barrel and went into the trash where it belongs."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in town.  No question. Hands down.  And that's after several years of living here and trying many other spots.  Try the Alaskan roll with cream cheese for a real treat!  My favorite roll anywhere!  So fresh and full of flavor with ingredients that taste a notch above the rest."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  5 stars for Ambience: I really loved the ambience here. I don't know how they did it but I felt extremely comfortable and ready to eat as soon as I entered the door. I would definitely hire their interior designer if I ever opened a sushi joint. Furthermore, I like how everyone is in costume from the sushi chefs to the kimonos on the waitresses.   3 stars for Nigiri: Ordered yellowtail, salmon, and uni. It wasn't fresh as I expected. Is it because it was a Monday night?  2 stars for Dinner Bento box: It came with tofu steak, katsu, and other bento items. Weak dish, pobably not a good idea to order it again.  3 stars for Kake Udon: Noodles were perfectly cooked, broth had a nice mushroom/earthy undertone.  3.5 stars for agedashi tofu: Decent flavors and decent serving (enough for 3-4 people to share).   Conclusion: It seems that I should try famous rolls next time I return. I really like the interior design so much that I'd come here with my friends to grab a few drinks and appetizers in the near future."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the past year and they never let me down.  This is some of the best sushi I've had and I've been told by locals that this is the best in town.  Service is excellent. They have a few TVs with the games on them.  The grilled shishito peppers make nice accompaniment.  Definitely some of the best tuna poke I've ever had (get it spicy!!).  Great job!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi i have ever had - very fresh - i didn't buy so i don't know the pricing but I Love Sushi is my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"You gotta go here!  Always great food and a fun atmosphere.  If you want something spicy, go for the burn in your stomach roll or kiss of fire."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi joint! No it's not ayce, but the quality is worth it and I never leave hungry or disappointed. I love the one night stand! Other good ones are the tastes let ex wife, kiss of fire (very spicy), something's wrong 69.... So many more. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi! TV screens for all you sport fans! Many varieties of sushi with different flavors, layers and textures with friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Great selection of rolls, espcially with soft shell crab.  Cherry Blossom Roll is interesting.  Overall, I haven't been disappointed with this restaurant so far.  Sake Bomb!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Japanese burrito and the spicy tuna roll. Was not a fan of the spicy tuna only because it had green onions in it and I hate green onions. The tuna was very fresh tasting. Melted in my mouth!"}
{"text":"I use yelp all the time to find a good place. This is my first review because I was that disappointed! I'm not sure what everyone is ranting and raving about.   1st.- customer service: I called ahead of time and asked if I can get 1 sushi boat for my wife and I to share lady on the phone said yes and it was posted at 28 dollars or so. SHE DID NOT MENTION IT WAS 2 ORDER MINIMUM. The service was very fake not genuine at all.   2nd- taste of sushi: very average if not a little below average. We got the boat which is basically a ton of tasteless CA Rolls with a few other things.   For the price and quality I would go somewhere else. Maybe an all you can eat spot down the street."}
{"text":"We're having The Love Boat tonight. It looks amazing!! This place is SO good! Sushi and hot items have yet to disappoint. :) Yakisoba Beef is super!!  We REALLY enjoy I Love Sushi!  It'll be a weekly or biweekly place for us.  :)"}
{"text":"I can see why the locals like this place. The service is good and there is a wide variety of options - sushi and non-sushi. Just note its Americanized Japanese food - not Japanese Japanese, if you know what I mean. The winner of the night was the teriyaki halibut that was steamed. We were warned that it would take a while to cook and it was worth it. The sauce was on the sweet side, but the fish was surprisingly light and not overcooked. Scallop roll was the best, poke was passing and the shrimp tempura in the caterpillar roll was pretty greasy, and again had really sweet sauce. I have to admit I blushed a bit as I read the sushi menu while sitting across from my grandma. Screaming orgasm roll? Really? Good thing it was dark so she probably couldn't read the menu or see my red cheeks."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to place for all you can eat sushi. My friends and I would go for lunch, dinner, any time of day. We've since stopped after they added unnecessary things to their menu like sweet potato fries (I came for Japanese food??) and they said because of the new menu they had to raise their prices. They now cost as much as Spoon and Fork, a much classier and higher quality sushi restaurant.  It's sad to say goodbye to a place I've gone for years but when you charge as much as another sushi restaurant who has higher quality fish, better atmosphere, and better service, I have no choice but to go there instead.  *Tip: They also got rid of their birthday discount of 50% off on your birthday. And yes, they told me this on my birthday as they handed me the bill... Thanks."}
{"text":"This is hands down THE best sushi joint in Henderson.   I've been going here for years & started just on the dinner menu. The chicken teriyaki, tempura, and dinner combinations are all excellent and well-worth the price (you get a LOT of food with your entr√©es). Recently, I started a personal challenge to try ALL 100+ chef specials on the sushi menu  (I'm in the mid-60s right now) and I haven't been disappointed yet.  Some must trys are: Sushi Nachos, the Grand Canyon roll, Something Wrong #69, and-of course-the Screaming Orgasm.  Be sure to ask for Lisa's section, too.  She'll make an already amazing experience perfect!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with my family around 2 pm on a Tuesday, and was quite impressed with the food and service here. May be on the pricier side for some but it's worth it.   Here's what we got: - Lunch Special [comes with miso soup, salad, gyoza, tomago (sweet egg), fried rice ball]. ($15.95) You pick 2 things you want off a list of things. We picked the following choices:    -beef Teriyaki + shrimp and vegetable tempura   -chicken Katsu + shrimp and vegetable tempura   - fish tempura + vegetable tempura]  Favorite part about the lunch special was the tempura, it was so light and crispy and delicious! Very used to having cold and soggy tempura- but that was not the case as it was fresh even at non peak lunch hour :). Beef teriyaki, chicken Katsu, and fish tempura were all good- can't really go wrong with any of these three!    - Spicy Tuna Roll ($6.50) - the spicy tuna just kind of melted in your mouth! Was really happy about this. Not too overly spicy either.  - Double D Roll ($14)- a special roll with tempura shrimp and imitation crab on the inside with a salmon avocado topping on the outside. Comes with a spicy dipping sauce! Really quite good, was impressed with the freshness of the salmon, a lot of flavor to this roll- I didn't even think it needed the sauce but was a nice have anyways.  - Kaki Udon - simple udon in a soy sauce based broth. Noodles were perfectly cooked.   They have a really impressive list of rolls to choose from.Would come back for sure due to the freshness of the food/fish and to try the sashimi next time!"}
{"text":"The Chirashi I had was decent, but I ordered a spicy tuna donburi expecting tekkadon, and instead got a salad of lettuce and tomato on rice with tuna, utterly disappointing. other sushi I had was fine.  Only ordered from them, never been there in person"}
{"text":"Good food, great service.  They always deliver.  This is the best sushi restaurant in Henderson, and there are a LOT of them!  I once counted 12 on the Eastern corridor from the 215 to Anthem alone!  They always come through for us.  It's usually my wife and me and 3 kids - 1, 2 and 11.  We've probably been 100 times, because they're always consistently good."}
{"text":"Best Sushi and Sashimi ever -- Was up here for a Triathlon in Boulder City and we drove all the way to this west side location to try it since it had such good ratings. Well worth the extra trip and will be back next time I am in Vegas for anything!"}
{"text":"So many sushi options to choose from. Definitely popular with locals (we came in on a Tuesday afternoon and I was surprised to see how busy it was). Decided on the boom boom nipple special and burning my stomach roll with the hubbs. Definitely good sushi but not the best. Too much sauce on the boom boom--and some orange sauce that was a little too tangy. Veggie and shrimp tempura was cooked just right--nice and crispy. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"The best sushi place I have been to in such a long time. Everything that I have tried has been very good whether it be one of the menu items or a special request with the sushi bar. My favorites are still the Screaming Orgasm and Lisa Hand Roll. If you like tuna, you cannot go wrong with these two items. They are absolutely fantastic! I visit or get carry out usually a couple times a month. I've tried several other sushi places in the area and have decided to stop wasting my time with the disappointment and just stick with what continually exceeds expectations... I will stick with I Love Sushi!"}
{"text":"They dont offer all you can eat sushi but this is by far the most delicious sushi ive had and spectacular fish!! Melts in my mouth every time, and the special thing about their fish, is that it doesnt have bad fishy smell u can encounter at other joints! One of my many date spots for sure! And the sushi bar is always fun and gets you involved!! I can suggest the ilovesushi special which is a tuna roll with this spicy sauce its fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite sushi spots in Las Vegas...the only downside (which really isn't, is the menu is HUGE, which makes it impossible to try everything even after 20 visits). Sitting at the sushi bar you truly feel as if you could be somewhere in Japan, and the waitresses in kimonos lends to the feel. We had the Dynamite, the seared peppered ahi with avocado and Double Ds, all of which were delicious.  We will absolutely be back..."}
{"text":"Authentic sushi served in an energetic & noisy setting. We were seated at the bar right away & given complementary edamame, as well as cucumbers with kimchee sauce. This was given to us after we used warm towels for our hands.  Sushi was served to us right from the chefs. Hubby & I enjoyed the Monkey roll, the Spider roll & the Last Call roll. Definitely enough food for the two of us without feeling stuffed! Staff was friendly & attentive. Would recommend if you love sushi!"}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi spot in Vegas. Great food and good service. My good friend lives around the corner and suggested it, he knows what to order. The screaming orgasm is highly suggested. It's a heaping pile of tuna on top of some sort of shaved radish with a secret sauce so good you'll want to drink it. You get a little house cucumber salad with some sort of fish and dressing, very good. They have a huge menu and that can be a little overwhelming, the waitress gave a few suggestions and she didn't let us down."}
{"text":"Huge menu. Something for everyone. Lots of seating, but the seats along the walls are best. Host has great specs. Real busy so when the waitress finally comes order everything you will ever want. If you sit at the bar the sushi chef closest to the front is abrupt, engaging, and hilariously inappropriate. The chefs love to cat call fine honeys that walk in. Loud and cool. You'll hear people having sake-bombs. Not AYCE. Gourmet rolls can be greasy. I have too many favorite rolls to list. Parking usually is a pain. Bring your white friends. They will feel comfortable because their brethren are primary clientele. Lots of things to look at so if you have nothing to say to your food companion it will not be weird. Be ready to wait forever for your check."}
{"text":"Now my favorite sushi place of all time.  I loved the lobster roll.  Just a whole lobster tail stuffed with a california roll.  How could you go wrong?  They have this weird divider thing going on at the door though, which was kind of weird.  This place was busy as well, so maybe call ahead for a reservation.  Everything was super fresh.  The  more prepared rolls also had a great taste."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the only bad thing I can say is it is very noisy. Love this place and plan to go back many more times."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi! The rolls looked dull though, I wish the presentation was better! Otherwise a decent sushi restaurant with an authentic vibe to it!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool inside.  It's pretty big but this place gets packed.  I never had to wait but I would call because it does get a lil kray kray.  They have nice private booths inside.  They welcome you by saying something in Japanese.  The sushi is fresh.   I had yellowtail and it was like butter.  The specialty rolls were ok but I am partial to regular sushi.  I came here last week for my first time and I have been back already.  The beer is 6 bucks for a large Kirin or Sapporo. This place was recommended to me by a local and now I recommend it to you."}
{"text":"The best Sushi place hands down in Vegas! May be the best overall Sushi Place anywhere in the country. Hard to beat this place.  This place is packed day in and day out - no matter the time or day. That speaks volumes of how much the locals love it.  The owner - James - is consistently in there every night making sure the place runs smooth and efficiently. Such a nice and friendly guy. He always takes care of my girlfriend and I whenever we eat here (we eat here a lot btw).   The Staff and Waitresses here are awesome and always on top of it with a smile on their face.  The sushi chefs are the best you can find!   Let's get down to why we come here - for the food!  The Sushi here is top of the line. The fish is of the highest quality and always fresh. Not to mention - the portions here are huge for a great price! The sashimi cuts are huge! The rolls are huge! They will even substitute for Brown Rice (which I always do)  The dinner menu items are really good if trying to do something other than sashimi or sushi rolls.   The rolls here are my favorite! The variety and selection of rolls is crazy - there are over 100 rolls! The rolls are huge! And not because they are full of rice like most sushi places - but because they are stacked with fish! These rolls will not disappoint.  A few of my favorites are: The James Special The Ryan's Special One Night Stand Kitchen Sink Something wrong 69 Spring Mountain Double D Screaming Orgasm Flower roll Stacy's Mom Las Vegas Roll I Love My Ass Lisa Hand Roll Bonzai Roll Monkey Roll   I have a lot of favorites - when I come here with my girlfriend, there is so much to choose from we usually end up ordering more than we can handle. Oh well :)"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best sushi place in Las Vegas. The ingredients are premium quality, and the rolls are all unique. The service is always amazing and the atmosphere makes it a great experience.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in YEARS! The last time I was here was probably five years ago! I remember the sushi being SO freakin' AMAZING.  My friend and I came here for dinner with Hunnie Bunnie. She ordered the Udon noodles like usual and some edamame. No complaints from her.  We had the garlic edamame: pretty damn good! It could have used more sauce but the flavor was good and the edamame was cooked well.  We had nigiri sweet shrimp: this was SO good. The shrimp was VERY sweet and BIG and the shrimp heads were HUGE. Good stuff!  The only one I didn't care for (I even spit it out in my napkin) was the Garlic Tuna Nigiri. I'm not sure if it was the flavor or just the fish itself - it was kind of rubbery, hard to chew. YUCK.  The rest of it was QUITE good though, salmon, tuna, white fish, albacore, scallop, unagi nigiri.  It definitely wasn't as amazing as it was the first time I had it but nonetheless it was still GOOD.  Oh yeah and we tried one roll: Tiger Roll. It was aiight. There are SO many rolls listed on the sheet of paper you check off and I didn't see any explanations of what was inside of them. I've had a Tiger Roll before so I wanted to try it here, however this one definitely had different ingredients then ones I've had before."}
{"text":"The sushi was absolutely delicious.  My daughter treated me out to lunch and she spent $60 on three orders and one soda (a bit pricey), but it was good.  The reason it got three stars is that the sushi went right through us.  Not a good thing.  I would not eat here again only because the prices were pretty high."}
{"text":"Yummy! Loved the Salmon Lover & Screaming Orgasm :) Service was quick and it's totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"I am completely new to the world of sushi. I spent the first 34 years of my life avoiding it at all costs...and then...  The soy wrapper.  Game changer.  Wow.  So, once I found out about the amazing soy wrapper it changed everything for me. The seaweed wrapper is fishy to me, I didn't enjoy that. The soy wrapper is nothing, no taste, just keeps the rolls together. So now I'm able to try almost anything.   My favorite thing at I Love Sushi is the Tempura Roll. It comes with rice, avocado, cream cheese and then I substituted the eel for cooked shrimp. It's lightly battered with panko and flash fried then topped with eel sauce. It's so good. We usually get two of these because everyone always picks off my plate. My wife loves the Pho.  We always call and make a reservation. They host/hostesses always make me laugh because they make sure to remind me to be on time at least twice during the call. Reservations are key on the weekends because the waits can be relatively long.  Also, the service is always spot-on. Super friendly servers, very attentive, glass always full. They also check on you multiple times throughout the meal. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING! I can't remember the last time I was throwing up so much and dealing with stomachaches and cold sweats. We ordered a few orders of sake nigiri and it smelled stale and not refrigerated. The service was great, but I'm in so much pain right now that I don't think I would go back again. Plenty of people recommended this place to me, but reading other reviews, it looks like I'm not the only one who got really sick. I would never recommend a restaurant where the chefs consistently get their guests sick."}
{"text":"Good sushi, overwhelming menu, great atmosphere, great service! Fun every time. :)"}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed it!! Everything tasted fresh, customer service was great, and the atmosphere was extremely inviting!! I'm not a sushi connoisseur, so it's a little difficult for me to evaluate!  I read the Yelp reviews and this was a top place to go! I'm definitely glad I listened. The Alligator Roll was my favorite. I tried the Screaming O based on everyone's suggestion; I wasn't the biggest fan. The Crunch Roll was a little plain for my taste.   I brought my girlfriend. I haven't been able to eat sushi for a few years because it's not her thing. So it felt great to make it here. They offer chicken teriyaki if you find yourself in the same predicament. So next time she says she wants teriyaki, we're going to I Love Sushi!! They have plenty of options aside from teriyaki (katsu, spicy chicken, etc.).    I'll definitely be back but I'll be trying other places to get to know my flavor profile for sushi!"}
{"text":"Screw best sushi in Vegas. I'm calling it, right now..BEST sushi in the world. Sorry Jiro, you have your dreams AND three Michelin stars, I Love Sushi gets the \"best sushi in the world\" title. I've had sushi from the west coast to the east coast. I've had it in four different countries (Japan wasn't one of them) and I Love Sushi is the best.  I'm not even going to go into the simple stuff, like perfectly cooked edamame, or the gyoza that can be ordered steamed or fried, the cool ambiance or the super friendly staff. You can get all of that at any sushi/Japanese restaurant.  I'm going to talk about their raw fish. Clean, fresh, seasoned to perfection, beautifully sliced, raw fish. Each piece of fish sets on top of a well proportioned pillow of rice. One bite and your sushi world will be destroyed. Every other sushi joint will fail to live up to I Love Sushi. Sure, you'll try other joints, mix things up a bit, but the whole time you'll be thinking \"man I wish I was at I Love Sushi\".  Don't take it from me though. Go there and order a \"screaming orgasm\". It's tuna, ever-so-lightly seared, swimming in a pool of their in-house made ponzu sauce on a bed of shaved daikon. If that's not enough try the \"something wrong 69\" roll. I: shrimp tempura soft shell crab. O: more soft shell crab and five different types of raw fish. PLUS it's served with a side of their DELISH ponzu.  And to the people giving low stars based on chicken teriyaki, or that the screaming orgasm doesn't come with rice...animals don't deserve to die to be eaten by you. Just saying."}
{"text":"All I can say is, I Love Sushi ruined me from going anyplace else! I haven't found anything better. Kiss of Fire, Something 's Wrong # 15 & 69, and Pepper Tuna no rice all among my favorites. Service amazing as well."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the past year and it is consistently delicious.  There's usually a 10-30 minute wait for dinner but no one seems to mind because the food is so good.  I recommend this place to anyone that asks for a good sushi place; even if they don't live in Henderson."}
{"text":"I LOVE I Love Sushi!  Every role that I've ever had there was amazing and also their prices are great.  I would tell anyone to check out this place."}
{"text":"Great quality fish.  I have been here about 10x and have always had a good experience."}
{"text":"Omg! I love sushi is fantastic.  Best  sushi place ever. I can't wait to go there next time. I have been going there for many years they are alway consistent whit quality and taste. My all time favorite there is crazy horse , Japanese lasagna"}
{"text":"When you come here definitely try the Jackpot roll (crispy shrimp and salmon) as well as the Grand Canyon roll (this one has scallops and mushrooms). The Mochi ice cream dessert is a must! They offer you 4 different options of flavors. I selected Mango, Chocolate, Green tea and Red bean. I wasn't too impressed with the Green tea one so maybe get extra Chocolate or Mango, the Mango was awesome!! I love the vibe here and the customer service is great!!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The seafood is fresh, the rolls are works of art, the servers are fast and friendly, the chefs are mesmerizing to watch, and they are always accommodating.  Service: The place is full nearly every single time I walk in, but they still manage to greet our party and get us seated as quickly as they can. We are offered pickled ginger, wasabi, edamame, and a cucumber salad within seconds. Drink orders are taken and delivered equally quickly. Our drinks are always full, our dishes are taken away as they are emptied leaving room for more dishes to arrive, and we are accommodated with special requests (my daughter loves vegetable rolls with only certain items and they are very nice about putting it together for her). We were even treated kindly when we had a shellfish allergy at the table; they made sushi and a roll on a separate area and were careful about serving it separately. Hot, damp towels are brought at the end of the meal, which is nice.  Meal: Orders are taken as often as you like (you can order piece by piece or all at once, they don't mind either way). Food is brought out fast, fresh, and beautifully presented. The chefs are so much fun to watch that I always try to either sit at the bar or seat myself facing them. I have literally NEVER had a piece of sushi, a roll, or any other dish that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. I always finish up with an oyster shooter because it's like a cherry on the sundae. *It's hard to say some of the names of the rolls to the server with a straight face, but I try anyway*  Price: Very reasonable for the quality of food offered. I gave it a $$$ simply because our party always orders drinks and a slew of fancy rolls. You do NOT have to spend that much to have a great experience.  Overall: I Love Sushi is on my shortlist of all time favorites. I spent my last 2 birthdays there and many a date night and family out night in between. I will be back!"}
{"text":"But seriously. Five stars is what I have to give this place because well, it was friggin' tasty and the service was LEGIT as well!  We were seated at a table within 10 minutes of arriving without a reservation... And then we dove into the VERY CONFUSING MENU... While I totally would have taken a star off for the menu basically resembling hieroglyphics, the rolls we finally decided on were so good, I couldn't! What I would recommend is taking photos of ALL THE ROLLS so people can get a visual of what they're about to order- HIRE ME, and I'll do it! Ha!  Any who... Here's what I ordered (there was more ordered but I was so into making out with my own order, I didn't really pay attention!)  - Salmon Skin Handrolls (no rice, no sauce, no vegetables): This is a staple order for me, everywhere I go... If a sushi restaurant doesn't have Salmon skin, I don't go! I was VERY IMPRESSED with the portion they gave me-- typically restaurants aren't used to my type of order thus they're stingy with their salmon skin, but not this place! Oh and the skin was crunchy and pretty perfect!  - Hamachi Kama: this was a last minute decision and I'm really glad I did it because it was MOIST AND BOMB! I love the cabbage accompaniment (that doesn't have dressing) because I took bites of the meat and the cabbage together and YUM!!!   - Rock N Roll, Roll (no rice, no crab- wrapped in cucumber): this is legit what I wanted but I had to create the menu item-- as this one comes with sauce on top, rice, crab and it's wrapped in nori... But without blinking an eye, they made this roll possible and IM THRILLED cause yes please! The fish to cucumber ratio was PERFECT! And the fish was FRESH AS F!  - Seared Pepper Tuna with Avocado: I didn't order this but three plates were ordered for the table... And I'm glad I got to snag a piece, because it was SUPER TASTY! It would definitely be something I share with others though because I love Salmon 20x more than tuna!  Next time I come to Vegas, YEP- coming back here! It's not close to the strip and I'm 100% a-ok with that! When good food is on my radar, I don't care how far away it is from me!"}
{"text":"This sushi place is amazing!   After living here two years we've thought about trying other sushi places, but we are always scared we won't find a place as good as this one!  John Holmes roll= amazing, Monkey Roll- hell yes, Ryan Special- yep it's delicious.  Everything they serve there is delicious and the restaurant is always clean and the staff is friendly.  Hardly ever a wait for a table and every trip has always been amazing. Basically I wish I had sushi right now as I write this review......"}
{"text":"My family's go to sushi place. Cherry blossom is a guarantee must have. Everyone is always super nice and this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME place!! I just can't say enough.   A buddy of mine who lives out here showed me one of two spots where the locals come for some incredible sushi without the outrageous price on the strip.   The interior is amazing.  I felt like I was transported back in time to a Japanese Tea House. I didn't realize how big it was.   I tried the Kiss of Fire (they warned me several times of how hot it was).  Incredible and very flavorful (Having a taste of the exotic and spicy), I didn't flinch.  My buddy had a couple rolls that I tried and I have to say it was damn good.  I can't say enough about this place.  Staff, Service, ambience.  Great place for a date.  Get out of the main casino strip and try the local spots if you can.  You'll save change and try some amazing rolls and Sashimi that's hard to beat."}
{"text":"Location, location, location.  Why the hell is this place so eff-ing far?!?!  JK, it's not THAT far.  Just far from me.  Truthfully I'm a sushi snob.  I feel that I have found the absolute best sushi place in Vegas, and I Love Sushi is not it.  The food wasn't bad though.  The tuna didn't look as fresh as I would have liked, so I chose to leave that part of my Hawaiian roll to my friend.  If he got sick, well it was his fault for dragging me there.   The Monkey Roll was pretty good.  That was really the only way I got out of feeling like I was cheating on my sushi place; by eating things on the menu that my joint didn't offer. Tried my first oyster shooter at I Love Sushi.  To quote myself the day that I tried it, \"How is it possible that they took a lot of really really good things, put them together, and made them awful?\"  Oyster on the half shell for me, please.  I did like how big it was and the kimonos that the hostess/waitress wore.  Very colorful.  Loved the sound of their flip-flops flippy-flopping.  One last thing....is there anyone else that felt like they were borderline dark-dining?  It's called a L-A-M-P."}
{"text":"I must have gone at the wrong time ;(  The first sign should have been the actual sign on front that said \"help wanted\".  Service was worse than any other sushi restaurant that I've ever tried. There were a total of four customers and two tables, us included and service was just horrible. As there were more employees than guest, kinda strange. Had to ask for help twice and took another ten minutes to get our order.  The garlic edamame was good but that was it.  I had the Baked Lobster and it was 95% mushroom and the little lobster they did give you wasn't even any good. Would not recommend.  Would definitely not recommend this place, clearly overhyped or I just caught them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Dynamite and Jackpot!!!!!! Sooooo good!  The food came soo quick and the servers are so nice! Love it here! Definitely coming back to try more food"}
{"text":"*Rock N Roll-one of my all time favorite sushi rolls! Different types of fish sashimis rolled in soy paper and wrapped with a slice of cucumber. Soy paper was a substitution. I recommend this option because the soy paper is light in flavor, unlike the regular seaweed wrap which might take away from the freshness of the fish inside. This dish comes with five thinly sliced lemon slices. The lemon is for garnish but I definitely recommend eating it with your sushi. The acidity of the lemon paired up very nicely with the fish and leaves a refreshing palate craving for more. This dish only comes with 6 pieces! I wish I had ordered more. *Screaming Orgasm-comes in small and large options, sliced tuna atop of a huge bed of radish drowned in sauce. Tuna was drowning in the sauce; took away from the simplicity of the fish. This is a signature dish of the restaurant. Maybe I came on a bad day? Probably won't order the next time I come here. *Deep Fried Gyoza-I usually like my gyoza steamed then caramelized for some color and texture. But this one was too fried for my taste. Came with a side of gyoza dipping sauce. *Kiss of Fire-This dish was drenched in spicy sauce. I couldn't taste much of the contents within because the sauce was overpowering. Reminded us of a Mexican enchilada dish almost. If you do want to try this dish, ask for easy sauce. *Dancing Eel- We asked for easy sauce for this sushi roll since the Kiss of Fire roll was disappointing. The eel tasted fresh. Simple roll, nothing too special.   The decor and uniforms that the waitresses wore were very cultural. I loved every bit of it. The waitresses were super sweet and greeted everyone with a smile. They wear kimonos head to toe and have their hair in a traditional Japanese up-do. The service was excellent and they checked in with our table often to see if everything was okay and to refill our water cups.   I would definitely come back to visit again! I can't wait to try their other sushi rolls (they have plenty of variety which makes it very difficult to choose)."}
{"text":"I love yelp.  I wish people would be stingier with the stars.  Four stars means I have nothing bad to say even if I do.  This place is great.  They have apps that are different for a sushi joint, specialty rolls that stand out and atmosphere that is cool, lit well and not so typical in the Japanese storefront feel.  The owner will occasionally don the Elvis garb which slays me.  This is a very good restaurant, a great place to turn a newbie on and it has sex appeal."}
{"text":"A great choice for Sushi. The product moves. The help is great and the prices are fair. I love the \"Threesome\" or the \"Super white fish\" don't hesitate to eat here."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I have ever eaten at! The place is always busy, which is a good sign! The staff is attentive and super polite and the quality of the fish is top notch. It isn't as cheap of some other places around town and they do not offer AYCE, but that doesn't matter because everything else is so amazing! The garlic tuna, Double D roll, and Johnny's roll were my favorites. They also offer warm sake and filtered or un-filtered sake, something for all sake lovers! Also, I recommend making a reservation if you are coming with 4 or more people, especially on Friday or Saturday night!"}
{"text":"The best sushi by far not a bad roll in the house, only 10 min from  the strip..worth the trip, yummy"}
{"text":"I have lived here 10 years and have always been told how great this place is, so tonight I had a chance to try it out and it did not disappoint!  The shishito pepper appetizer is delicious. Fantastic quality sashimi. The rolls are outstanding. We will be back.  Very soon."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon, around 1:30 and sat at the sushi bar.  The place wasn't busy at all, only four other parties seated in the whole restaurant.  There were three sushi chefs and four servers at the time.  Everything was prompt at first.  We received drinks quickly from the server and our first roll only took a few minutes.  The selection of sushi rolls was good, the food tasted good, but the service was flat awful after the first 15 minutes!   The only time the servers came by was to refill my drink (he had a large beer and a water, so his did not need refilling).  We were almost completely ignored otherwise.  One of our rolls was forgotten and our sushi chef disappeared (for about a half hour), and it was a good 15 minutes before we could get anyone's attention to find out about our roll, and service did not improve after their mistake was realized.    Furthermore, we wanted to order more drinks and dessert, but after waiting another 10 minutes for a server to come by, we just opted for the check instead."}
{"text":"Been eating here for over 10 years & never had a bad meal!  Sushi is always extremely fresh and so tasty!!!  It gets busy every night so go early if possible."}
{"text":"One of my favorite non-AYCE sushi places.  It's so close to my house!  The sushi is super fresh--it glistens, like it came straight out of the water, sliced up, and jumped right onto your plate! haha! When it comes to sashimi and nigiri, they give you thick, fresh cuts of fish.  This is the only place in the city that I've been to that has THE freshest tasting uni (if you have any suggestions otherwise, please comment ;)).  I could eat a million orders of their uni.   Service is cool.  The ambiance is casual.  I suggest sitting up at the sushi bar cuz those dudes are awesome.  I'm not gonna leave a super long review, because people have already raved about this place.  The rolls are great, appetizers are great--THE FOOD IS GREAT. LOL. Just go, you won't be disappointed.  It's worth the $$, especially if you enjoy good quality sushi."}
{"text":"One star is generous.Tempura dripping with oil . Smoked Salmon rolls are cooked.Fire roll  is deep fried without saying it is . Fire roll  cooked.  Nori wrapper very chewy . lost track  of rolls that were cooked but expected raw.  We had to ask 2 different  servers 3 times to stop cooking  the damn sushi.  √ùGrilled Eggplant soaking in oil.Tuna roll  looked like previously frozen,thawed pureed into some kind of red paste and stuffed in a wrapper which disintegrated like snow on a hot plate when in your mouth ....left half the rolls untouched hoping the next plate  would send a signal to redeem the previous one.No luck.The girls apologized but no compensation  on the 50 bill.presentation nice but that's it.Seaweed salad good but not for 50 shekels.  Something very wrong  here."}
{"text":"everytime we visit family in vegas we have to eat at i love sushi because we love sushi! the variety of rolls offered here is amazing. so on our last trip back we were super disappointed with the quality and portions. the nigiri was sad. tiny pieces of not so fresh fish and ok sushi rice. one of our faves- the screaming orgasm (who doesn't love one) was a big miss as well. the tuna was drowning in the spicy sauce. i've been there in the past and loved the rolls (hence the three stars) but it was pretty awful this last time as far as sushi freshness and quality goes."}
{"text":"I'm a recent transplant from California to Las Vegas.  I'm still trying to find the sushi place to replace my favorite in Lake Forest, CA.  I feel like once I find the rolls I like at I Love Sushi, this will be the place.. but I'm still searching.  I haven't settled on one I really like yet.  I am really not happy with the caliber of affordable sushi to be had in L.V.  (Of course the super pricey places on the strip like Nobu are amazing, but who can eat there once a week?) - All you can eat sushi is never as good a quality as regular a'la cart sushi. And every place I find here in L.V. is all you can eat!  It's something with the consistency of the rice and the quality of the fish.  I Love Sushi has quality fish.  Now if I can find one of their rolls that's similar to my favorite Jak Sal roll at my old Cali place I can finally settle down to a regular joint that I can visit weekly."}
{"text":"Our favourite nearby take-out sushi, although you can sit in and eat here, but it's got more of a snackbar ambiance.  We epecially like the nigiri special which is a good deal.  Good well-flavoured rice, generous portions of fish, very friendly service and inexpensive.  It's not super delicate authentic Japanese sushi but still delicious and straightforward, and the Vietnamese rolls with rice paper are interesting to try. The little chocolates at the end of the meal are a nice touch, very popular with my kids."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten at I Love Sushi is quite a while, so I decided to try it again last night with 3 guests.  The environment is quite nice, even kimono-clad wait staff.  But, sorry to say, the food quality has really gone down hill.  And you do not want to eat sushi that is not excellent.  There is too much excellent competition in Henderson and Las Vegas to settle for mediocre.   I give it 3 stars only because of the attempt to create a nice Japanese environment, but I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. My boyfriend and I came here about a week ago because a family member had recommended it. I wouldn't say it was the best sushi I've ever had. We ordered a few rolls, a salad and octopus sashimi. I can't remember the crazy names of any of the rolls. (Not a fan of the names btw.) I ordered a steamed shrimp roll with avocado and eel sauce on top. He ordered a shrimp tempura, tuna roll of some sort with garlic sauce and another tuna and shrimp roll. The garlic sauce on his was very overpowering but the other two were tasty. We have other favorite sushi restaurants when visiting the Las Vegas area so we'll stick with them."}
{"text":"I  I love Sushi!  To be treated with such great service and great food, an all encompassing grand experience is divine and delightful.  Thank you for such a beautiful experience for my daughters 18th Birthday."}
{"text":"Love this place and I have been a regular since opening day.   I do go to other sushi bars to try out, but keep returning to I love sushi. Maybe its the way they immediately greet you when you walk in the door. Even if there is a wait, which there typical when we go on the weekends, its only 10 -15 minutes.   Our favorite - The screaming orgasm, seared ahi with a mayo and vinegar sauce on top of daikon radish! Yum.. the only difference I have seen over the years is the portion is getting smaller. The large order now looks like what the small did 4 years ago.   The bonzai roll is another favorite, shrimp tempura rolled into a california roll and drizzled with teryaki sauce. Spicy salmon another good choice along with the James Bond roll.   All this with a Sapporo beer makes for a great dinner out!   If you love sushi, this is a place to try. They have a huge selection, food tastes great and the service is fast!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! One of my favorite places always busy!!! all my family goes there and love it! Great service, family friendly and very fresh fish!  U gotta love I love sushi!!!!!"}
{"text":"Initially we had chosen to eat at this place solely based on Yelp reviews. I mean a place must be REALLY good if it rates 4.5 stars out of 5 correct?! Boy was I wrong.   When we first entered this place, I thought it was a pretty cool ambience. We entered on a Saturday afternoon and it was not busy at all. Waitresses greeted you with cute kumonos (sp?) on and cool Japanese music was playing in the background.  The first thing I noticed is that there is no AYCE here?! What the heck is up with that? And to top it off, one specialty sushi roll is average about $16.00 PER ROLL! A spicy ahi Hand roll was $6.25 per roll? You have got to be kidding me. Better be sprinkled with gold or something!  So quickly, my boyfriend and I decide on a lunch entree instead. Mind you, my boyfriend and Just came from the gym and expo so we are starving! We order 3 entrees for 2 of us and while we are ordering the third entree the waitress says something along the lines of \"oi! More food?\" I thought it was rude and then hilarious!  I did not get the waitresses name but she was probably the heaviest one there (just so that you can spot her, and not experience her rudeness.) Anyway, she delivers our 2 entrees and once she places my plate down she says \"no more entree for you okay?\" I had to kind of piece it together that she meant it was after 3 so no lunch special. She does not say anything about our third entree after like 10 minutes of not delivering it. So I proceed on asking her where it could possibly be and she rudely cuts me off and says \"it's on the way!!\"  After we are finished eating and she is cleaning our table she sees that I could not finish the tempura (2 onion tempura) and proceeds to tell me that I can request no onion next time! I cut her off and explain that I was full!   Horrible experience and to top it off, I got diarrhea after eating there! I'd rather eat at Sushi mon! They have all you can eat and not rude whatsoever."}
{"text":"To keep it short and sweet this place is amazing. I've never had a bad experience and I've probably been here 50 times. Anytime someone makes me go elsewhere for sushi it doesn't even come close to comparing to the quality and experience you receive at I Love Sushi. Everything is good so go ahead and order something you wouldn't normally go for. The rolls have funny names like Stacey's Mom and I Love My Ass...it's funny to hear the servers repeat it back to you. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the sushi here. Came for a bachelor party, and there were 5 of us. We had so much to eat and drink, we could've used a nap afterwards. Easily some of the best sushi I've ever had. 100% worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch over the weekend while visiting my parents. Cute abiance. Tons of different custom rolls. Great seaweed salad. Friendly waitstaff. My only complaint...I asked for water and the waitress brought me a glass of someone else's water that she refilled. She apologized profusely, and I don't feel sick, so that's good!  Located in strip mall kind of behind a Taco Bell. Would definitely visit again if in the area!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Henderson and Las Vegas! Less rice more fish which is always fresh. Have never been disappointed with service and quality."}
{"text":"I tried different rolls, they were good. The food is Fresh and very tasty. I wasn't expecting this in Vegas...  Pretty busy place but staff is polite. Good place to eat."}
{"text":"Great food! I really liked this place..... What I did not like was how difficult it was to order! There are about 1000 different rolls on their menu, many of which only vary by 1 ingredient so you really have to sit there and read what each one is (since the names help you figure out nothing in regards to what's actually inside). The names of the rolls are really tiresome and stupid... No I don't want an orgasm/penis/vulva roll. Can't sushi joints just name their rolls what they are?? It took about 15 minutes to just read everything and actually figure out what direction to go in terms of ordering. Sadly, the waitress we had spoke very little English so she was of very little help in figuring it out.   All that being said I ended up ordering a dinner special with a few different rolls on the side (no sexy orgasms or weird sauce stuff, just basic sushi rolls and nigiri - eel, salmon, tuna). The fish was very fresh, the tempura was perfect and the chicken katsu was really good!   Definitely my new favorite place for sushi in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas. The Ryan's special and jackpot roll are the best! Super friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the car, our tummies were grumbling. We couldn't go far. We jumped on to yelp to find some good eats.. long story short, this restaurant is sweet."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, I literally grew up here. Like, this place is about a mile from my house, and a block from where I went to high school and we'd walk here after school and get takeout (we were spoiled ok?!). We knew the sushi chefs by name, and when we got a little older (not old enough), we'd sneak sake bombs before going out to the coolest party ever. The inappropriate names for the rolls were the funniest thing we'd ever seen- it was the bees knees and the best sushi I'd ever had.   Fast forward 10 years, and sadly times have changed. The quality of the fish seems to have gone downhill and the cold fresh rolls just don't taste as fresh and the hot crunchy rolls are drenched in indistinguishable sauces. I really hate to say this, but last time I was here a few weeks ago, two of us got sick from eating the same roll. It's still a fun place to meet friends and get some so-so food, but now when we want a quality sushi dinner (it's all relative), we'll head down to Spicy Tuna."}
{"text":"Gooooood stuff. I am not from the area but read the reviews and said why not. I am glad my fellow yelp friends didn't steer me wrong. This place has some great names for their sushi but some really great sushi. Try the Mountain Roll or the I Love Sushi Roll. You wont regret  going here, even if you are away from strip drive here and enjoy. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Love this place, owner is amazing, fish is over the top great! Strongly suggest trying!"}
{"text":"overpriced as hell. One thing that I quickly noticed from previous experience is that they keep the lights dim or practically no light at all. They gave me my plate and underneath it was so sticky and had some dried old food on top. I couldnt even eat, I left"}
{"text":"I know you're supposed to get what you pay for but this is a whole new level. They actually used canned tuna in one of their rolls"}
{"text":"Went for the dinner buffet and arrived around 5:30-6pm on a Saturday. We ordered way too much sushi that we couldn't finish. Shortly after feeling bloated, and looking at the amount of food we still had to finish, we asked them to cancel the upcoming orders that we had already placed. They didn't make a big deal about this. I really appreciate the fact that they charged us a mere $3 for the amount of food we left behind.  ;) we packed that in a takeout container to go.  The sashimi was fresh and all the beef appetizers I had were delicious. Beef roll with enoki, beef roll with green onion, spare ribs, bacon wrapped asparagus!! - You don't see that quite often. The mackerel was tasty too. I wish I had a chance to try some of the house special rolls. This is overall your typical sushi buffet."}
{"text":"I LOVE SUSHI SAYS IT ALL!!! I currently live in DC, but used to reside in Las Vegas, and fell in love with I Love Sushi. Screaming Orgasm is to die for! and \"I hate my ex boyfriend\" (or it might be girlfriend) is great as well. I love all the creative sushi's and names they are given. This joint is always on my mind, and I miss it soo much! I wish there was a \"happy-go-lucky\" sushi spot in DC like I Love Sushi."}
{"text":"#102 Sun Devin is a must! Other favorites #69 tiger roll, #81 Chris Special, #99 John Homes"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in the valley. The freshness, quality, variety and service are unsurpassed. I've lived in Las Vegas for over 12 years and I keep coming back to I Love Sushi for the best Sushi experience. The focus is the on quality of food, not showmanship. It's in a small anonymous strip mall but it's worth coming to even if you live in the Northwest corner of the valley. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years but used to frequent another as well. I came in one day to find one of my favorite sushi chefs now here. I brought my family down for sushi on Friday and sat at sushi bar in front of my longtime friend Joe. We had the best sushi experience in years as Joe was giving us his spin on some of our favorites. My kids love sushi but we're talking about how it was the best sushi we ever had. I love sushi is great but having Joe there puts it over the top for me. There are some great sushi places in Vegas and this is by no means the only great place but people make a difference in the over all experience and everyone here is great."}
{"text":"One of our favorite go to places for Sushi. Great assortment of specialty rolls. I was there a few nights ago  and they had blue fin tuna as a specialty fish for the evening. We have always had good service."}
{"text":"This is always a great place for good quality sushi.  The lunch specials are a good value; comes with pickled sliced cucumber, edamame, choice of 2 main dishes, soup, salad, 2 pieces of vegetable gyoza, inari sushi, sweet egg and steamed rice.  The food is consistent and service is always good."}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in vegas, it's not all you can eat, but def worth the price per roll. Friendly and attentive wait staff, no complaints here, always fresh!"}
{"text":"The best sushi place in Henderson.  They do not have all you can eat but that is because they use fresh raw fish and they do not use imitation crab. For the sushi lover this place is a must try. This is a hidden gem in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I'm allergic to fish and shellfish but love Japanese food. This was definitely the place to go!  I took my 5 year old son here to try sushi for the first time. The staff was friendly and gave great recommendations for him. Soy paper wrapping is better than seaweed for kids. He loves the California rolls ( no mayo) and enjoyed the atmosphere.   I decided to get veggie tempura and habachi chicken ! It was perfection! The price was right and the service was great! It was an over all enjoyable experience! I'd go back again and again!!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried several rolls from their special chefs menu and my favorites include the johny roll, James Bond and jackpot. The jackpot not as much anymore since it's a total project to fit each piece into my mouth. The johny is great if you like fresh, seafood and crunch - cucumber. The James Bond is basically the same but with rice. If you are kinda into sushi or on the fence you have to try I love sushi! If you really love sushi and can't get enough, you're doing a disservice to your life by not trying it."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for business.  I had heard about this place a few months back so we decided to make the 15 minute drive to Henderson.  All of the rolls we ordered were delicious.  The sauces were also amazing.  But most impressive of all was the gentleman who was seating the guests.  He appeared to be the owner. We arrived around 7:30 and the place was packed. We asked for a booth. Even though the available booth was for 6 people (and it was just the 2 of us), he gave us the booth  - after I told him we had travelled from LA and had heard great things about this restaurant :) All the servers were attentive and super friendly.   Definitely will visit again the next time we are in town.  YUMMMMMY sushi!!  Recommend 'rock and roll', 'gary's special', one night stand' and the seaweed salad was also delishhhhh.   Thank you \"I Love Sushi\"!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. The food is always amazing and the service is friendly. Only four stars because sometimes I feel like I'm being rushed, but I guess that's normal for a locals place that's good and busy."}
{"text":"This place has the best Sushi in town. There's usually a little bit of a wait on the weekends, but it's so worth it! My favorites: The Screaming Orgasm & the Japanese Lasagna!"}
{"text":"Incredible sushi! Super fresh! Clean. Service was only okay. She was kinda rude and didn't seem like she could handle our order. Luckily the sushi was so good that we will go back but not because of the service."}
{"text":"Boom Boom took care of us again! Hands down...this is the spot for Sushi!!!  This place rules! Every person we tell to try it, loves it! The Uni tops it all!"}
{"text":"Forgot to look this place up on Yelp before making a hungry, knee-jerk order with a couple friends.. but it was actually satisfactory.  Perfectly mediocre.. probably wouldn't order again, but not worthy of the 1-star reviews I'm seeing here.  I had only maki (party tray: 61 rolls for $44), so can't comment on anything else.  Bumped up to 3 stars because a) delivery to my downtown hotel was fast (and courteous) on a Friday night and b) they actually gave me extra ginger and wasabi as requested."}
{"text":"I love I love sushi.  I've taken out-of-town guests there 3 or 4 times, and all have left with little japanese food babies and big smiles.  You can miss it easily, as it's tucked into the back of a strip mall...with one tiny little sign to let you know where to turn.  But if you miss it, keep circling until you find it...it's worth it.  Consistently fresh sushi, and reasonable prices.  Great, dark wood decor, with serving staff in full traditional dress.  I always feel like I'm on a little fantastic voyage away from Vegas when I step in here.  Service isn't as great as some others in the valley, but the price is right, so I can cope with a little less butt-kissing.  One of my top sushi picks in the city.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go. while waiting for my order, they had me wait on their couch. I was surprised how busy they were. The waitresses wore kimonos (so cute), the waiters just regular black pants and white shirt. The restaurant was well decorated, booths on the side and tables in middle. I ordered some lobster rolls (i think it was little \"¬†heavy¬†\") and the Monkey roll (salmon, avocado, cream cheese, sesame seeds) it was very good forgot to mention the special sauce they put on the side so my sushi is not soggy. I enjoyed my monkey roll with some ginger! yum yum waitresses outfit are really entertaining. Since i was waiting for 20mns, I was looking at the staff running around, none of them had a smile on their face ...  The 2 girls at the entrance were a little \"rude\", when I came in I asked for the menu so i could order to go  and if they had any suggestion for some rolls with cream cheese and avocado. they looked at me and whispered something in front of my face, that was very rude... Ladies when you do, please be discrete... i went there yesterday night 01/06/18"}
{"text":"Well, I guess if a place is called \"I Love Sushi\" I should stick with strictly sushi.  BUT, I was drawn to the \"Tuna Poki\" option on the menu, and I love poke (note the spelling difference).  I've learned since then that Korean \"poki\" is slightly different from Hawaiian \"poke\".  That doesn't mean it was bad - it just wasn't my thing.  So I suppose this is my warning to poke lovers.  I also had some salmon-avocado sushi.  That was good.  Not the best salmon I've ever had, but pretty good.  I sat at the sushi bar and service was outstanding.  It better be; there's like 16 guys running around behind the bar cutting fish, so whatever you order, you get it pretty quick.  I did get accidentally charged for a Mexican roll that the people next to me had ordered, but the mistake was fixed very quickly once I pointed it out.  Always check your bill, kids!  Some raw fish and a bomber bottle of Asahi and I was very happy by the time I left."}
{"text":"This place is has great environment and very friendly wait staff. All waitresses are dressed as geishas and are very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The rolls are a bit on the pricey side, but they do have a great variety and the fish is very fresh. The one down side is that they do not have ayce(all you can eat). With 14 bucks for a specialty roll it really adds up."}
{"text":"I do enjoy the more traditional sashimi and simple spicy tuna hand rolls - but there was something fun about reading the menu at I Love Sushi.  Makes ordering fun.  I loved that the waitresses wore traditional kimonos.  And the fancy rolls were delightful."}
{"text":"I stopped in after reading the reviews.  It was very crowded but easy to get in to.  Place was fun, and loud, but not too loud so you couldn't have a conversation.  Everyone just seemed to be having a great time.  One of the really nice things is they have plenty of staff to get your food out to you quickly and in and out in a timely manner.  I tried the screaming organism because of the reviews, it was really good and I loved the sauce.  I also tried the kiss of fire, but on the not so spicy side.  It was good as well.  This place was a nice find for a fun, quick sushi stop."}
{"text":"I live completely across town from I Love Sushi, but it is worth the drive. I stumbled upon this place through Yelp while I was in the area. Now I go out of my way to make it back whenever I can. It is completely al a carte, so be prepared to spend some money if you are very hungry.  It is worth it."}
{"text":"The absolute best Sushi hands down.   Excellent food and superior service.  I love the cucumber salad with fresh crab on top.   I  have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered.   You must try this place.  Always busy but minimal wait time.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Town, freshest fish, best rolls. I come here for 2 ears, enjoy every time."}
{"text":"With names like stacys mom special and sex on the sushi how can you not love this place. The best thing on the menu was by far my ex wife :)   The entire atmosphere of this place was perfect for any group function. The folks that I went with were having a blast, between the Saki bombs and asahi super dry we were definitely causing a ruckus and no one seemed to mind. The sushi was fresh, so i had no concerns of internal battles with fish and seaweed.   I am definitely not a sushi person but i have to admit that being drug out to I Love Sushi and being forced to have a good time was by far one of the best decisions ever made for me. You gotta try this place."}
{"text":"Delicious rolls!  This place is a hustler.  They fill up quickly and the clear quickly.  The sushi chefs are sushi-making machines!  If you're on a time crunch to lunch, definitely come here.  You can have a 4 course meal in 30 minutes.  It's just a little on the pricy side..."}
{"text":"The service is adiquit my family had enjoyed 3 rolls we had the spicy yellowtail sashimi 4/5 stars the sauce is amazing it really pops out in an amazingburst of flavor. We also enjoyed The Kiss Of Fire 3/5 stars it was good but it was quiet spicy and I'm not big on spice but it was quite good. Last but certainlynot least we had the Dancing EEL Roll I give it 4/5 stars it was exquisite it was a burst of flavor in so many ways the eel scause is great and I'm not a big fan of eel but it was sweet and had a amazing taste. I recommend this restaurant extremely for a family it was and amazing experience and can't wait to come agian I stand strong with my opinion."}
{"text":"With a name like this, I expected horrible food. However, my well-traveled sushi connoisseur buddy insisted on leaving the strip and driving off toward Henderson to the great little sushi dive. I call it a dive only due to the older, casual ambiance. The food and service were solid 5 star.  We overate ordering something like 12-14 rolls for 2 people. Additionally, we both had the sashimi salad. Many of the rools have too much mayonnaise or funky sauces. If you catch it upfront and request only brown rice, you can make this a healthy v hardy experience.  The sashimi salad is one of the most generous and best sashimi salads I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi fanatic. My boyfriend and I are always trying new places. I've been here a few times and it's literally the best sushi I've ever had. The quality is great and they have a lot of rolls to chose from. The only downfall is that they don't have an all you can eat option so it gets pretty pricy. The rolls are defiantly bigger in size and the presentation looks great so it makes up for it. Try the I love sushi special and burn your stomach roll. I would suggest making a reservation too because it gets PACKED on the weekends."}
{"text":"My first experience with I Love Sushi was just a few days ago and I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK! My friend and I sat at the bar, and we were quickly taken care of. The sushi was amazing, the ambiance was so authentic, it's definitely a new favorite. Being new to the area I was searching and searching for a sushi place off the strip (I love RA sushi) and I've found it!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Recommended by a co-worker. Not AYCE. Food overall a bit salty and slightly borderline on sauce overkill.  We tried two of their nigiri - halibut  and garlic tuna nigiri at around $4.25 each for two pieces. Fresh fish, but too much ponzu.  We ordered two cut rolls. The spicy tuna roll was quite spicy but delicious. So was the eel roll.   Tried the lunch special. You can choose two entrees and it comes with salad, miso soup, inari, tamago, chicken gyoza and steamed rice. We ordered the chicken katsu (cut into six pieces and breaded just right) and salmon teriyaki ($1 extra).  We also ordered three specialty rolls: screaming orgasm, something gone wrong #7, and taste like my x-girlfriend. The screaming orgasm had no sushi rice at all but was very good. Halfway through though, the sauce became too much, especially if you eat the shredded radish under the fish---it sucked up all the sauce. The taste like my x-girlfriend was delicious but also too much sauce. The best was something gone wrong #7. So so good. It also comes in a dipping sauce, but is perfectly yummy without it.  Add in two hot green teas and I was $81 lighter after our meal. I'd come back again, but request less sauce. Ample parking in the plaza lot."}
{"text":"Always amazing! This place is packed and rightfully so! I love the cherry blossom and the screaming \"o.\" One of my favorite sushi places!"}
{"text":"Combining two of the best cuisines can't be at all bad, can it? I dropped into this place for lunch while looking for a simple sushi place. I didn't realise that they were a combined place until I looked at the menu, which was Japanese for Page 1 and Thai for Page 2.  It is pretty standard fare, a selection of 2 rolls with soup and salad for their sushi bar special. They also have a sushi lunch special which comes with sushi, tempura, gyoza, rice and salad combinations. I was disappointed to note that they do not have chicken kaarage though.  The Thai selection is more of the classics like Basil Chicken or Beef and Pad Thai. It looks to be fairly average, even though the sign on the door indicates some kind of accreditation as \"Bangkok Paradise Authentic Thai Cuisine\".  The sushi I got was reasonable. The rolls were cut into 6 rounds, but both the salmon and avocado roll and the unagi and cucumber roll I had, included only a frugal amount of filling in them. Nothing to complain about but smaller than other sushi places I've been to. It did work well into my plan for a light lunch though."}
{"text":"Very high quality ingredients with great service. The atmosphere is fun if you sit at the bar, intimate if you sit in a booth, or great for families or parties at a table. My husband and I love this place. They will custom make anything, also.  Sake bomb, anyone? :-)"}
{"text":"The best sushi in town. Atmosphere, service and sushi were all 5 stars. Our server was the best. Our drinks were always filled, food came out presented beautifully. Our friends from out of town were happy we went here. Even my friend from out of town said it was some of the best sushi he's had. Their appetizers are great too! The place was packed, but we were able to get seated within minutes."}
{"text":"Another favorite! Once you've had sushi here, you'll have trouble loving other places as much. Don't get me wrong, I do like other sushi restaurants, but this is our favorite. Even our friends & family from out of town, always want to go there when they visit. Try the Pepper Tuna. If you like pot stickers, get the spicy ponzu sauce to use as dip. The spicy edamame is great too! The service is good & prices are reasonable too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is soooo good I will defiantly be back Joe is awesome so kind and kid friendly"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best sushi in town. On top of having the best sushi they are so kind and treat you with the up most respect while you are there. Sushi and costumer survive is on point."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots in Vegas, always amazing, great sushi, the fish is fresh, I'm a fan! It's certainly in my rotation for Vegas sushi"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!!!  The wait staff and ambience are great as well. The Vegas special (#54) is great. Can't go wrong with some tall Sapporos either."}
{"text":"This is where I broke my Las Vegas sushi cherry... TMI?  After a long day of driving a U-Haul across the CA/NV stateline, lifting and unpacking boxes I was ready to eat, but I was sick of fast-food and pizza options. I yelped Sushi and this place popped up with 4 1/2 stars? Let's do this!   I placed an order for pick-up and they said it would take about ten minutes. Hmmm, ten minutes for 2 orders of Udon Tempura and 2 Caterpillar Rolls? I decided to test this and arrived 8 minutes & 25 seconds later. \"Hi, order for Tiffany?\" (my GF) \"Yup, right here...two orders of Udon Tempura and 2 Caterpillar Rolls\"...whoa, this place is on it, but how does it taste?  I brought it home and feasted. The Udon Tempura was very good and full of flavor. The tempura was delightful, not to greasy just lite and flaky. Poi-fect! The Caterpillar rolls you could tell were super fresh and delicious. These were definitely made to order.   This place gets an easy 4 stars. I'm coming back to get the full restaurant experience soon. Maybe this will lead to an updated review and a added star?"}
{"text":"I Love Sushi is hands down my favorite sushi spot in Henderson (and I have been to them all).  The service is always incredible prompt and friendly and sushi is incredible.  The #22 flower roll and #28 jackpot roll are the best on the menu and mindblowingly good.    The only con is that they don't offer \"all you can eat\" and I am a huge eater but the quality and atmosphere make up for this.  I HIGHLY recommend giving I Love Sushi a try!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is just ok.  Nothing fancy.  Food was alright.  Not sure if I would be back again.  However, I will say that our waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"√áa y est, je viens de trouver mon nouveau restaurant √† sushis.  Vendredi. Il √©tait 21h. Je n'avais pas encore mang√©, et l'envie de prendre des sushis fut imm√©diate.  I Love Sushi (Rue Saint-Denis, non loin de l'intersection Rue Rachel Est) est, comme son nom l'indique, un restaurant √† sushis.  L'int√©rieur n'a vraiment rien d'exceptionnel, mais ce n'est pas le d√©cor qui me d√©range personnellement. D'ailleurs, il y a une petite terrasse ext√©rieure qui n'est pas pour me d√©plaire : bien pour y manger durant l'√©t√©. Mais parlons plus des sushis.  Vous avez plusieurs choix qui s'offrent √† vous : des makis/sashimis/sushis aux compositions originales, √† la carte (par 5 ou 6 il me semble), ou bien les menus du chef (\"menus express\") avec diverses compositions. √Ä noter que ces derniers sont moins chers le midi que le soir. √Ä ce propos, question prix, c'est vraiment tr√®s abordable : comptez 8$ pour le menu le moins cher (sans la boisson et le dessert). Je crois que le plus cher co√ªte dans les 24$, mais vous avez plus de sushis :)  Le temps de pr√©paration n'est pas si long que √ßa : √† chaque commande, j'avais attendu 5 √† 6 minutes, ce qui est vraiment rapide. On vous fournit wasabi, sauce soja et gingembre bien entendu.  Pour ce qui est de la qualit√©, c'est correct, voire tr√®s correct. Chaque bouch√©e est un d√©lice, le temps de bien savourer votre plat : le succ√®s est toujours au rendez-vous. √Ä la fin, vous avez le ventre bien rempli !  Le restaurant est tenu par un couple vietnamien super sympa, ils me rappellent m√™me mes parents. Et c'est toujours un plaisir d'aller manger/commander l√†-bas.  Pas cher, rapide et avec une bonne qualit√©, c'est pour moi le bon plan √† ne pas rater ! Pas le meilleur restaurant sushis, mais pour un √©tudiant comme moi, c'est le fun.  Petit plus : vous pouvez t√©l√©phoner √† l'avance pour commander, le temps qu'ils pr√©parent votre menu. Une fois arriv√© au restaurant, il ne vous restera plus qu'√† payer."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super fast and attentive service, especially when you're seated at the sushi bar. The specialty rolls are amazing and diverse and the names just crack me up. Definitely not for the conservative, I think they'd be offended by names like \"tastes like my ex girlfriend\" and \"I love my ass\". Creative rolls, fast service, good prices, really friendly staff. Its a place I would go to 3 times a week if my income allowed it! Someday I will have tried everything on the menu."}
{"text":"These people do not love sushi. Ordered delivery. Took 1.5 hours. It arrived cold. They told me 40 minutes. The free soup was good. The free salad was edible. Everything else was the worst I've ever eaten. Really really bad. Yikes!"}
{"text":"From start to finish everything about my experience here was average.  Greeted at the door by a host that may have been a robot. Service was nothing special. Sushi rolls were big but very plain to me. The Joe roll was dry, I ate one piece and left it. Prices were high for an off strip restaurant with no wow factor. We came here because they have great reviews, maybe we caught them on a bad night."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say I hated it, ate 2 sushi and little else.  I ordered a chicken udon, a combo sushi and a specialty - they forgot one sushi, not that it mattered -- everything was essentially inedible.  Udon was greasy, with little taste and slimy looking, the sushi was grey and had a weird flavor.  I was hoping for the best but spent $50 including tip, for hoping I wouldn't be ill."}
{"text":"After several tries my famly convinced me to try sushi so I did.  Six of us went to I LOVE SUSHI to celebrate my grandson's 20th birthday.  He's been a fan of sushi since he was 7 so who am I to argue?  LOL.    I'm hooked.  We ordered 10 different items and just layed them on the table smorgasbord style.  Wow.   The Japanese Lasagna is great but I would recommend sharing it cuz it's very rich as was the Orange Bowl, no rice - excellent! .  I particularly like the Mistake roll, D.C. Roll, Franky's special  and the Yum Yum Roll.  Everything was terrific but those were my favorites. Had something called Joe's Special and Johhnie's Special roll and like them as well.   I especially like the cucumber salad they served as we sat down.  My younger grandson doesn't eat sushi but ordered a plate of Pot Stickers and loved them.    I have nothing to compare this place to foodwise but I know that everything I tried was excellent and very well prepared.   Had to bring home a couple of containers of their pickled ginger and the wasabi is REALLY over the top good.   The service was great but I have to admit we got there early in the evening.   The ambience is Japanese right down to the kimoni type dress the waitresses were wearing.  Gave a nice touch to the whole ethnic scene.    My  highly experienced sushi loving friends are happy that I'll be joining them from now on and they recommend I Love Sushi also.   Gotta go with the flow on this one."}
{"text":"I give 5 + starts for the food, i always say i won't comeback because of the service, but then i go to other sushi place in town i  regret not going to i love sushi.The waitress were OK, everything was served on time and fast.  For the service i give 1 star just because of the owner /manager in the front. I felt like Seinfeld's episode when they go to this awesome soup place, but the chef is horrible and they can no tell him anything because he won't sell them food anymore!  He has no customer service sense, i hate seeing the sushi bar staff getting yell at! come on! they cook a great sushi! don't humiliate them in front of your costumers!. And what is worse! i just was telling him i was waiting for my friends and he got mad at me! aghh!!  i love the sushi but i don't agree with that manager's customer service."}
{"text":"Going through town,  and stopped in.  Good food,  and there lettuce hand wrap is delicious"}
{"text":"Horrible experience  I am new to sushi and I was treated so bad   Any question I had a recommendation they would not give me and they gave me the cold shoulder most the time. literally had asked a couple next to me for a recommendation. I did not feel welcome nor did I feel like I should be there. This is not a place that I will ever return to     It seemed Like I was more of a nuisance than a customer. I could be in middle of chewing my food and my plate was taken away from me       I ordered multiple orders of salmon belly and decided to order a beer. At that point I was asked is that the only thing you're going to order a seven belly over and over? Who cares I asked questions about what sushi you have and I told Jose knew that you are obviously upset that I'm ordering the same thing which I know is safe. O   I will not recommend this place to anybody nor will I ever be back.   I work in the food industry, I serve people day in and day out. I've been doing it for over 20 years and the way that I was treated and the service I was given I don't recommend anybody."}
{"text":"Best. Sushi. Ever. Prices are good and the food is wonderful! I've never had a bad experience!!!"}
{"text":"been coming here for years.. always packed amazing amazing amazing! I drive 5 hours just to eat here get the lisa handroll its bomb! the only thing I don't like is they hav over 200 rolls so its anxiety sitting trying to read all of them figuring out what to get.. this is the best sushi in all of Nevada :)"}
{"text":"So many amazing choices here! The menu is huge! My favorite was the Kitchen Sink, but everything I tried was amazing. Super fresh and good prices too.  We sat at the sushi bar and all the sushi came out super quick. All the staff was very friendly, efficient and attentive.  I Love Sushi is officially on my list of \"must eat at\" places in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best sushi places here in the Vegas area.  Each sushi roll and every bit of nigiri is prepared with care and made to look beautiful.  The prices are standard for sushi, and not too expensive, though of course not something you can get every day in good conscience.    The service is good.  I've eaten several times at different times in the day, and the waitresses are always polite and prompt.  They're a little subdued in early afternoon, but they're quite nice at dinner times.  The atmosphere varies, but not at all badly.  In the lunch times and early evenings, when there isn't as many people, they're a quiet, pretty restaurant that you'd take someone for a chat while you eat, whereas when you are at dinner, especially on a Friday or Saturday, they're full and very noisy.  Why noisy?  Because the sushi chefs are busy being fun and crazy and flirty (with women) and sometimes randomly offer free drinks and shots of things, and if not, then they're being bought drinks by the appreciative customers.  But the service is always good.  The quality of the fish has never let me down.  Even on Sunday nights, when most sushi places are at the other end of freshness, I Love Sushi seems to chug along as usual, and some of the dishes just can't be matched anywhere.    I always eat Dynamite at sushi places, and theirs was quite good, if not the best in the entire world.  I'd say it'd be great to order if you're there, but not worth a special trip.  Overall, I love coming here when I have extra cash on hand.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have an all-you-can-eat option, which I suppose would make the service level fall, the quality diminish, and the presentation falter.  But I eat a lot of sushi :/"}
{"text":"Busy Busy but Fast service....I like how the waitress were kimonos !! Yummy sushi and bento box a lot of food for a good price...nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmm.  I miss having a large variety of sushi restaurants and rolls.   My kindred spirit took us to her favorite sushi joint in LV and I must say, it's delish.  They had so many rolls I could barely finish reading the list before our waitress came by to take our order.  The fish was fresh, the sauces were creative, and the custom rolls were executed wonderfully.  You will need to try the Kiss of Fire roll which is a combination of spicy fishes drenched in some spicy sauce then topped with a dot of sriacha and a jalapeno.  So good...Most importantly, the prices are wonderful."}
{"text":"The food is great, and the staff is very friendly. I recommend this place to all sushi lovers."}
{"text":"In Vegas for Superbowl weekend, wanted to find the best sushi in town. I think I was successful, this is a very good sushi spot...the chefs were polite, service was fast and extremely courteous. The servers are lovely looking in traditional Japanese garments. The ambiance was done right as well. I ordered the Boom Boom nipple special and the Dragon roll. Both were delicious and I'm planning on going back for some of the other menu options before I leave Vegas. Highly recommend this spot to all who are looking for good food away from the stop."}
{"text":"Actually we are fan of sashimi and sushi . So we came to i love sushi and expect to get really fresh fish and unique sushi . But over all on the menu most are sushi roll .so we try a hand roll , sashimi . Which is ok . And unagi don came with good portion but eel little too sweet and have some bone which is you have to careful litle bit while you eat . And yellow tail collar was very disappointment because the fish was old and taste not impression . ( made me got diarrhea later that night ) . For the service for out table i guess the waiter not really attentive . After he took an order he came back a couple time to asked again that what we order . We took not too long to finish our dinner before we leave we have one lady to seem like she attention but just right before we get a check ."}
{"text":"Style over substance. Poor saki selection. Lots of crazy rolls with hip names.  It is a chore to get a nice nigiri off the menu. Meh.   Sloppy preparation. The rice just falls apart.   This place is popular so maybe it was good at one time. But it has jumped the shark if you ask me ;("}
{"text":"Wow great sushi place in Henderson. Been here twice in two days! I'm traveling from out of town but am glad I found a nice healthy high quality place to eat while I'm here. Love the peppered tuna avocado dish!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi off the strip!  Very friendly service too."}
{"text":"This place is so weird & good at the same time. I was in Toronto for work and stumbled across this ridiculously cheap sushi/thai AYCE. I was intrigued and went it. Sure enough, you get two menus, a sushi menu and a thai restaurant menu. You basically get to order whatever you want for a flat fee. Be warned, the thai portions are relatively large. I did 2 rounds and then felt really bad about a 3rd because it was so cheap. I didn't want to singlehandedly put them out of business.   I liked their thai soup with chicken the best. And the salmon sashimi wasn't bad!  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Great sushi outside of the strip!!!! My wife and and I LOVE SUSHI. We tired the Jackpot, and Last Call.  Amazing!!!!!  Will be going back."}
{"text":"In a city where a sushi joint dots every single corner I love sushi is a true standout. The variety of rolls and sushi is unmatched by sushi joints in Las Vegas. Sitting at the sushi bar is always a good time. The sushi the chefs can do saki bombs with you and feel like part of your party.  Although they don't offer \"all you can eat\" like most places in town, I love sushi doesn't need to run promotions like that and the place is always packed. The service and food make people come back time and time again. Check it out be sure to try the MC roll, Japanese lasagna and the screaming orgasm."}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  The dining room is pretty large and was packed.  My friend informed me that it was packed every time she has been there, but we were still seated immediately.  The waitresses are dressed and Gieshas which was really cool.  The food was amazing, and I highly recommend the Sushi Nachos.  They were delicious.  Will definitely be making it my regular spot."}
{"text":"The Best Sushi in the entire valley. Very friendly and helpful I learned how to order sushi here."}
{"text":"What is all the hype about this place. Agreed, it's packed with people. However, a sushi roll is just a roll. If your looking for true sashimi then this is not the place. Their bento and udon is..eh. Had much better many other places.   You really can't tell how fresh the fish is because it's covered with ponzu sauce or some kind of sauce. If you like that, go for it! If you are truly looking for traditional Japanese, not the place.  Service is good. Atmosphere is loud."}
{"text":"This I Love Sushi . . .this is good stuff. It's a bit of a trek, especially from the center of Las Vegas, but after two visits here I can say it is worth it. Who would have thought there would be so many sushi restaurants out this way, but many there are and thanks to a recommendation from a local in the know we found I Love Sushi.   I'm not a sushi expert but I can tell when the food is fresh and of excellent quality. Next time you're in a sushi restaurant order some Uni. It's a good way to gauge the quality of the food. I Love Sushi's Uni scores well.  Sitting at the bar, I thought the sushi chefs were professional, friendly, entertaining, funny and good at what they do which is to make great looking and tasty sushi.  The service was very attentive, almost too much so, but that could be attributed to the fact that this restaurant actually reads their Yelp reviews and realized that people have previously made comments about their iffy service.   Here are two dishes I've had and really liked, the Caterpillar Roll - tempura shrimp, cucumber, eel topped with avocado and eel sauce; and the Dragon Roll - California roll topped with eel and eel sauce. Both were fresh, fresh, fresh."}
{"text":"This is my go to Sushi / Japanese food. I have eaten there soooo many times and have no bad experiences. The selections are plentiful and delicious.  With the amount of people that eat there, the selection is always fresh.   Best Sushi in town! Something for everyone."}
{"text":"Yum - order off the menu rather than from the train. They have a killer poke bowl if you choose rice instead of noodles and it is so fresh and tasty that I lay awake at night craving it!"}
{"text":"The sushi here was amazing! Probably the best sushi I've had. The owner, James is extremely hospitable and friendly. 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place with my wife. Coming 2 times monthly. Monkey roll and Jackpot special is the best ones we like"}
{"text":"We've been a few times now and enjoy the food very much.  Service can be a little slow as they are quite busy - but that happens.  Spicy Tuna - down the road has essentially the same menu and they're half as busy.  My feeling is the rolls are a cut above...and the service is better."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  I'm pretty picky about my sushi and this place is probably one of the best in Vegas.  I also find the owner to be rather amusing, although maybe his employees don't appreciate his heavy involvement so much.  :)  But he seems to genuinely want customers to have a good experience.  The food itself is amazing.  it's always busy, best to make a reservation.  But if not, we have never had to wait too long for a table."}
{"text":"Went here based on a suggestion of a nearby business.  The service was very good, the wait staff is very attentive and our server suggested a delicious coconut sake that we loved.  Now the bad part:  the sushi tasted fresh enough, their menu is too big to parse out, and they wanted to start taking our orders immediately.  Everything is a la carte, no AYCE.  I did not love a single item of the 4-5 rolls we ordered.  We tried a sushi nacho thing that was too sweet, the sauces were either spicy and runny or poorly described on the menu.  Every item was just a little OFF.  The worst part comes today as my boyfriend and I have been sick all morning with GI distress after visiting.  I walked out last night disappointed and I woke up beyond angry that now I can't travel today because I'm locked in my bathroom.  Update: I called the restaurant the next day and a manager got back to me 4 days later.  They were very kind and apologetic, I chose a refund of my money instead of a credit at the restaurant.  I'm glad they offer this sort of service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere, service, food and the servers. I especially enjoy the authentic japanese robes the ladies wear on their shifts.   Fish is not that fresh. Ex: cuts of fish was VERY VERY COLD/icy-like, as if it was recently thawed out from being frozen.   I enjoy authentic foods and was in the mood for ebi (live shrimp.) They said they have it, but it is frozen. Hands down, without hesitation I passed on this. (Just an FYI.)  Recommend: * \"Bam bam\" * Oyster shooters - yet the oysters are small. * Ginjo - cold sake. Very tasty and smooth.  Pass: *Cucumber wrapped rolls, items listed without rice. They skimp on the  quantity/portion of the fillers for the rolls if you order it this way. A great disappointment. * Sashimi - magaro. Only came with 4 very small pieces. Not worth it.   Overall, the food was good. I would go again."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Probably the best me and my wife ever tried. Guys are great out there,especially Aron and Randy. Best sushi guys ever. Super friendly.  A+"}
{"text":"First time I walked in to I Love Sushi was about four years ago and the sushi chefs yelled \"James Dean, hi James Dean!\" at me. Now, I've been called a lot of things in my life, mostly Macauley Culkin, but I have NEVER been called James Dean for the indisputable fact that I plain and simple don't look like the Rebel Without A Cause. However, after doing a few shooters and sake bombs with the chefs, I truly did feel like Dean and we joked and joked about it until I walked to my car and let someone else drive so I didn't actually end up like the late actor (faceplanted into the pavement.)  Joking aside, this sushi is the best in town. I've never been disappointed by a visit and every time I try something new and have a new favorite roll. Some of my favorite menu items include the Bonzai Roll and the Yellowtail Sashimi. The flavors of each are top notch and so fresh.   Lunch specials are very affordable and include a buttload of food. Stop reading this already and go find out why we all love I Love Sushi!"}
{"text":"This place has been a must ever time we are in Vegas.  15 minutes from the strip out in Henderson which works well since we have friends that live out that way.  We have never been disappointed and the pricing is amazing compared to other Sushi places we've been around the country.  Half the fun is reading the chef's special menu with all the crazy roll names.  We definitely have our favorites like Kiss of Fire, the classic Rainbow Roll, and Crunch Roll but have to try a few exotics every time.  This trip was the Boom Boom Nipple Special, very good and became the war cry for the weekend.  LOL  Trust me and give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.  My only suggestion would be shorter glasses for Saki Bombs instead of the mugs they use, but that's not a big deal."}
{"text":"When in Henderson/Vegas, this sushi joint is hands down the best there is.  Some of the names can't be written or repeated here (when you see the menu, you will understand) but I had two different ones that were killer.    Tip:  Ask for the Natto Hand Roll.  It's not on menu but you know you have a authentic Japanese Sushi Bar when they have Natto.  Cash and Credit Cards accepted."}
{"text":"I have tried several places here in Henderson and one one impressed me, I Love Sushi :)  Try the Jerry Roll or any of the sashimi or sushi...All Very fresh.  And their service is definitely 5 stars too."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Great service, food and price. Highly recommended to everyone . Great atmosphere too"}
{"text":"We've been here several times . And just last the other night with a group of friends . And our two little ones. Under one years old .Service was excellent and the food is amazing !   Went again last night . This time our service was terrible . Our waitress was annoying and terrible made a comment saying she thought I gained weight from the last time she saw me !!!! Rude !!! Lady I'm 4 months pregnant!! Keep your thoughts to yourself and be professional. Last time we came out waitress made our dining experience wonderful . My 10 month old .. I order her a miso soup and ask for lots of extra tofu . As it is soft for her to eat and she loves it ! Last  night I asked the same thing and the waitress that was annoying said , I did put tofu ! When there was barely any !Uhhhh I won't be coming back because she's been our waitress everytime we go ! Mind you she not a very attractive lady herself . And shouldn't be commenting about a pregnant girls weight ! Over priced and not worth the bad service."}
{"text":"i always have a good time at i love sushi.. i walk in everyone is so friendly while you are getting seated at the same time. i usually ask for a table rather than the bar. fast service good sushi! well i get the crunch roll with soy paper, extra eel sauce or a chicken teriyaki roll with soy paper & of course a side of eel sauce!! i also get some mango mochi after. i leave satisfied every time so what's better than that!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time they deliver the goods. 100% of the time we are in Vegas we come here. No ifs, ands, or buts"}
{"text":"You can tell a great sushi spot when they don't have an all you can eat option. Fresh rolls and great apps. Hands down my favorite sushi in town. A little far up Eastern Ave but it is worth the trip. Huge sushi roll menu. My two favorites are the Jackpot and Crispy Rice roll."}
{"text":"Do you like lukewarm miso soup?!  If you do, pick up that phone and dial I Love Sushi.  I ordered from this place online (Just Eat) and it took an hour and a half for my food to come.  Like, had I known, I woulda walked over to the McDonald's around the corner.  When the food got here I chugged the miso soup then tried the teriyaki beef.  It was okay.  Dehydrated from the commute.  The california roll wasn't good nor was the entire experience.  I was so hungry, I wasn't even hungry no mo!    I love sushi, but I don't love these carelessness at \"I love sushi\"   2 stars cuz you didn't completely wreck the steamed rice."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, this is not the best Japanese restaurant in the area. But I come here more often than the other restaurant for  couple of reasons.  The place is lively and fun. It's busy, has a good buzz going, and the service is always good. The waiters are efficient, friendly and precise. Some of the women are career waiters and know how to work a table with humor. My favorite waiter is great with kids and engages in small talk without taking time away from her other tables.  Portions are big. This is white man's Japanese food. One \"John Holmes\" sushi roll for $12 is a meal. An order of tuna sashimi is bigger than anywhere I've ever been.  Food is consistent. You won't find toro, shima-aji, or kanpachi sushi here. That's not what their clientele wants. But the rolls are creative. I know what to expect and I've found items on the menu I'm comfortable ordering time and time again.    If you have friends that are rather middle-of-the-road, and not very adventurous, you can bring them here to introduce them to sushi. They'd also have plenty of meat and other cooked dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"By far the best. Sushi. I've. Ever. Eaten. I have nothing else to say but put this app down and go there now."}
{"text":"Delicious! Speedy Friendly  Highly recommend this place   Alligator and Lobster rolls were fantastic"}
{"text":"Convenient location from my home with decent prices. I had the jackpot roll, monkey roll, and the spicy tuna roll. My favorite bar far was the jackpot roll. Of course anything with tempura is amazing but this one really stuck out as the bell of the ball of flavor. Service was prompt and friendly as well, even on a bustling Saturday night! Think I will give a few of the other rolls a try on my next Vist and the plum sake was probably the best sake I have ever tasted for less then 100 bucks a bottle."}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant to eat because of the ratings.  I promise to never eat there again, nor will I recommend it to anyone.  I will agree that the service is fast. I was there on 3/03/2016.   It is almost as if they want their customers to get in and out again as quickly as possible so more people can come to eat.  The tuna poki was way too spicy.  Even my hubby who likes a little spicy did not like it.  It was too hot for him.  They took away my cucumbers before I had finished them.  They did not bring wasabi or ginger to the table...I had to flag someone down to get it.  My rainbow roll tasted fishy.  It was so bad I didn't finish it.  I would have liked to discuss this with someone, but nobody ever came back to our table.  The green tea was scalding hot, too hot to drink.  By the time my first cup had cooled enough to drink, I was done eating.  As we left the restaurant, I mentioned going out the door that I did not like the rainbow roll, which in turn was said to me I should have mentioned it earlier.  Well, I would have liked to mention it earlier, but nobody ever came back to our table.  I got tired of waiting.  The food isn't worth the price, the hot tea too hot to drink and the follow-up service non-existent.  I won't recommend this restaurant, nor will I ever eat there again.  At least I didn't throw up what little I ate of the rainbow roll.  For an $85 tab for 2 people, the food and service should have been much better."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite non-AYCE sushi place.  Sitting at the sushi bar is always fun as the sushi chefs are very friendly and interactive.  They always start you off with a cold cucumber dish.  Yum!  As silly as this sounds, I had the best California roll I've ever had here!  I recently tried the Grand Canyon roll which was phenomenal.  A hidden gem for sure!  The ambiance is so comfortable.  You can sit at your own private table or out in the open.  The restaurant is always busy!  I'm always excited to try something new when I come here.  A must try if you are a sushi lover! :)"}
{"text":"Hands down my entire families favorite sushi restaurant! We are regulars here and every time we leave completely satisfied. Our favorite rolls are Kiss of Fire, Bam Bam, DD, and Jackpot Special. Other menu items we love is their Screaming O, Pepper Tuna, chicken salad (very flavorful), jalape√±o yellowtail sashimi, and spicy edamame."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Las Vegas! My friends and I go here once a week - sometimes twice! Always sit at the sushi bar! The staff is fast, attentive, welcoming, and love to interact with the customers!   Food - They have 116 rolls on their menu, so you are bound to find something you like. They have rolls without rice if you are trying to be healthy, and deep friend rolls of you are feeling crazy. My favorites are the salmon lovers, the boom boom nipple special, and the fat ass special. The fish is always fresh, and I have never had a bad experience.   Sake - We have never done official sake bombs, only the shots. They have 5 different flavors, and they are strong!   Definitely worth the stop! BEST SUSHI IN VEGAS!!!"}
{"text":"This Place is on point.  Best Sushi and service in Las Vegas/Henderson.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Great food. The quality of fish is very fresh. Great vibe too. The sushi chefs in center are very friendly and funny. There is always a line outside at certain times. I loved the followin sushi dishes: dynamite, pepper tuna no rice , spicy tuna , crazy horse , Japanese lasagna. I cant wait to go there again. Heard its been here for years."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Vegas, they really nailed it here.  Their American style sushi is prepared in front of you if you are sitting at the bar, which I recommend for a fun social experience. The staff is highly entertaining, serving double-duty as chef and social ring-leader they are somehow always successful at getting my group to participate in a round of saki bombs.   The chefs recommendations are always a good direction to go. Their service is fast but they don't rush you, allowing for a fun dinner experience whether you're out with a group or on a date.   The decor is cheesy and perfect. It can use an update, but if they do I fear the environment would change, so I do not recommend that they change a single thing.  If you are a sushi snob, this might not be the place for you, and we probably wouldn't want you hanging around us anyway. But if you are looking for yummy food and a consistently great time, I Love Sushi is your place."}
{"text":"I've had a really hard time finding a good sushi spot in Vegas. Too be honest freaks me out a bit (we don't have an ocean lol) but I heard this place from a friend so I went to try it out. It was amazing! Really fresh fish and awesome rolls. There is an older man who is so cute he owns the place and he is there everyday. He seats you and checks on your through your meal. The staff wears kimonos and look very traditional, the place looks \"crowded\" at first but you warm up to its cozy vibe. I ordered albacore sushi and a baked lobster roll, so good. They are really good with food preferences and allergies too, I'm allergic to mushrooms and my roll had it in it so they made it without them. My sister had the mountain roll and it comes in a little pyramid and it has salmon and crab! This place is now my go to for sushi!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in Las Vegas. Hilarious menu names, delicious food, great service!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed about this restaurant when we drove into the lot was how big the sign was and then how big the restaurant was.  It's a big place and I highly recommend it for big groups!  They even have big booth like sections for parties of 6.  FOOD: Kiss of Fire ($13): Spicy crab, tempura shrimp, cucumber, soft shell crab, albacore & jalapeno topped with extra spicy ponzu sauce.  I tasted more lemon than anything else in this roll.  Maybe it should've said \"extra lemony ponzu sauce\" on the menu instead.  I Love Sushi Special ($11.50): Spicy tuna & cucumber topped with tuna & spicy special sauce.  This was probably my favorite roll of the night! They were very generous with the tuna.  It's got a kick but it's bearable.  Crazy Horse Roll ($8): Smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, green onion & deep fried with eel sauce.  This is an excellent choice for those who don't like raw fish.  It's creamy and sweet!  Fat Ass Special ($13): Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, crab meat, avocado, deep fried panko, spicy mayo, hot sauce & eel sauce.  My friends & I giggled when they repeated our order and when they brought it out: \"Here is the fat ass\".  HAHAHA!  This is a wide roll so you can't actually get all the fish in one bite.  Without dipping your roll in the surrounding sauce, it wouldn't be too spicy but if you drench it, you'll feel a good kick.  Green Tempura Ice Cream: They swirled the bottom of the bowl with chocolate syrup.  The tempura was more cake like than crispy but that's up to the restaurant's choice really.  The green tea ice cream was actually a little bland.  RECOMMENDED FOR: ROLL LOVERS!  Don't get all food critic-like on this place because this ain't the time.  Enjoy a long list of out-of-the-box rolls, crazy names & lots of sauce!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I went with my wife sat down started reading the menu, got up walked out. The staff asked me why I was leaving and I said the menu is offensive. Items like the John Holmes Roll, Threesome, Tastes like my ex girlfriend and others (many). I just had to say when. The acceptable level of disgust has reached the point where public places accept this as standard. Not me not anymore."}
{"text":"The past 2-3 times we have been to I Love Sushi, we feel as if it's gone downhill.  The service has been terrible.  The food & rolls were not as fresh as usual and just plain blah.  I am very disappointed...  Help, we need a new sushi home!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here a lot, but I have to say my favorite experience was watching a Monday Night Football game. I watched a few guys get absolutely trashed on sake bombs while eating at the sushi bar. Oh, and the food is really good too!"}
{"text":"This was easily one of the best sushi places I've been to. I love how unique their menu is. You can't go wrong with anything you order. I will definitely be coming back when I'm in town. It's well worth leave the strip to eat here."}
{"text":"This place has some really good sushi, however it would be cool if it was all you can eat (I drove from summerlin bc of all the hype and I didn't even check if it was AYCE)....but it wasn't a big deal at all! Overall had a great time here and the staff is very friendly! Will definitely stop by here again!"}
{"text":"Delish! Fun! Love the food, great sushi chefs. Been ere on dates, been her with fam and everyone leaves happy. A little pricy but great sushi is. Hear from a friend there's a kitchen sink roll that excellent. I haven't had it yet but will on my next visit. Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Don't know why this place has so many great reviews, Gyoza was terrible!!! Smelled terrible!!! We ordered three rolls that were very mushy and did not taste good.. We asked the chef to make us a roll based on what we liked and it was the worse roll of them all... Will never come back again.. Pushy staff and very rude when we said we did not like something.  If you want good Sushi go to Sen Of Japan off DI and Durango."}
{"text":"Tried giving I Love Sushi another chance, and left less than impressed. Off to a bad start with the crumpled paper napkin with a couple of specs of blood on it, as if somebody has squeezed a pimple. Ugh ! Well, here's the beer with a nicely frozen mug. Next was the Tuna Tartar with Salmon (!) and avocado, which was easily the highlight of the event. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there. The tempura shrimp in our first two rolls was tough and chewy, as if it had been fried a while ago. The other rolls were rather bland and forgettable. Would have been 3 stars with a clean napkin."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi restaurant in town. Good service and fish always fresh.  Plan on a wait Friday and Saturday night."}
{"text":"I love it   Good Service ,inexpensive  Spicy sushi  my favorite  Always full it worth the wait time  Very tasty"}
{"text":"I love sushi, but not so sure if I love it here.  There are many pros to this place, but here's why I thought it was just A-OK.  Walking in, you're greeted and waited by waitresses/servers dressed in kimonos (cute).  It was busy going to lunch on Saturday, but there was plenty of seating.    We decided to sit at the sushi bar.  I'm not exactly a fan of sitting at a low sushi bar where I have to look up to talk to the sushi chefs.  It's just awkward.    Tuna Karai, Candy Cane Roll, and the super white tuna nigiri (ono) are what we ordered.   The Tuna Karai:  $16.50 for a bowl.  You can go to Sumo Sushi and get a Tuna Karai for $14.00 and double the amount.  This was good, but not $16.50 good.    I love softshell crab, and I'm glad that I Love Sushi has a variety of sushi rolls that include softshell crab.  I decided to try the Candy Cane Roll.  There wasn't any sauce on it.  The flavor was just okay.  It had a weird after taste to it.  It was also a bit too salty too.  Just a weird flavor.    The super white tuna nigiri (ono) was probably my favorite.  They give you a generous amount of ono sushi.  Great with a piece of wasabi and soy sauce.    Maybe I'll come back and give this place another chance in the future, but for now, it was just okay."}
{"text":"My friend took me here while I visited her.  I saw a lot of raves for this place but in my experience, I thought it was ok. The service wasn't great and the food was overpriced for what we were getting.  I think I got used to sushi-mon in vegas which has great quality sushi for a great price as well!!  Maybe I came on an off night!!!  Who knows, maybe I'll come back and try it again."}
{"text":"Never been to the restaurant, but get food delivered from here frequently. Always fresh and tasty, and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was just a random pick because I was craving sushi. Thank goodness I took a chance on this place. My new favorite sushi spot!!! Service was super fast and the ambience was very traditional Japanese. I ordered the Dynamite Roll and my sister ordered the Jackpot Roll, and both were hands down, AMEEEEEEZING!!! I highly recommend this place and cannot wait to come back and try the Fat Ass Roll!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, soup, dumpling, atmosphere and service. Def will return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because it's a good 15-20 minute drive from the strip and it's in a lousy strip mall (which shouldn't count against them, but for ambiance and setting, it does).  Other than that, the sushi is excellent and the prices are awesome. Talk to any local in Las Vegas and they all love this place."}
{"text":"Sushi was average, I was pretty excited after seeing the reviews, but it isn't anything special. The cheapest roll I got ended up being better than their more expensive rolls. The pot stickers were pretty good, but the sauce they came with...not so much."}
{"text":"The food and service has always been great here. Just started going again after being out of town and still love it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi spots and it's right by my work which is amazing. The staff is so nice and sweet. The food I've never been disappointed it's always so fresh and good. I love the rainbow roll and all the salmon rolls just incredible. I always recommend this place to my clients and friends for a delicious sushi spot."}
{"text":"This place has always had the best sushi ever. Fish is fresh, food is great and the service is wonderful. If you love sushi, this is the place to go !!!"}
{"text":"This is the sushi place my friend takes me to whenever I'm in Las Vegas for a visit. On each occassion I've sat at the bar and the service has always been excellent and the quality of the fish has always been very good. They are prompt in making the sushi and the wait staff immediately clears the plate once you've finished. There is almost a factory like quality to the service in terms of efficiency. Although I haven't personally experienced, but my friend tells me that this \"efficiency\" also makes this place a bit undesireable if you just want to sit at a table and have a leisurely dinner. If your table finishes their plates and are just hanging out, it's almost guranteed that they will be politely asked to allow the wait staff to clear the table for a following reservation."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. Their sushi is always so fresh and the service is amazing. All the servers are so friendly. This is my favorite sushi place out here so far :) will be coming back a lot."}
{"text":"Def my #1 place for sushi. The atmosphere is great, the staff is awesome and the food is always on point."}
{"text":"Busy place on a friday night. cool interior-- although I think their attempt to look authentic comes across as a bit campy. Still, good sushi place.  Sit right at the bar and you'll get instant service. We never had a problem getting our orders to us in timely fashion. The Screaming orgasm was probably the tastiest of the specialty rolls we had. The meat was arranged in a poke like fashion over tasty crispy noodles and tangy sauce. I agree with a previous critic that they rely on sauce a little too much here, but it is tasty nonetheless. The jerry roll went down smoothly, and the crunch roll can be addicting. Dynamite was very filling and a good value pick ( if you don't mind baked rolls). For those who don't know, it's a mixture of scallop and chopped shrimp baked over rice soaked in a creamy sauce. They offer a huge selection of specialty rolls here but they also do nigiri. The yellowtail was very thick-- some of the biggest pieces of nigiri i've ever seen. The squid was as well. You don't have to go AYCE to get a good value here, especially if you're willing to try a number of their nigiri offerings.  We left quite full, and I would gladly return."}
{"text":"im gonna give a bump here because my lunch on Friday of assorted sashimi was decadent...  maybe it was a fresh order, or maybe its like this all the time?  who knows, but everything was delicious and of excellent quality...  for reference, just basic sashimi orders...  tuna, salmon, albacore, yellowtail, and white fish...  had a piece of a spider roll and it too was also very yummy...  maybe it was the Kirin Light, maybe it was just getting off the road after a 4 hour sojourn to Sin City from LA, but id recommend I Love Sushi to those looking for decent dead fish off the beaten path."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, they are so quick! Always making sure if we need anything else, excellent customer service and the cooks made me feel very welcoming and the servers are amazingly polite. I recommend anybody to go and try out the food, I love this place. It's also very dark and feels comfortable to eat and they have big wide booths I love it!"}
{"text":"The sushi is great but order the ROLLEY RICE BOWL..... It will blow your mind.  The jackpot roll with cream cheese added is amazing as is most of the rolls but the ROLLEY rice bowl is a MUST. I have never seen a dish like this in any other sushi place."}
{"text":"This korean sushi bar is located a good distance from the strip and caters to locals, especially those who want to drink and have a great time.  Be sure to take care of your staff of chefs here (seriously, I think there were 8 of them) with beer and they'll reciprocate generously.  I really just come here to hang out and drink with a local LV friend of mine and not really to eat.  However, I've learned the sashimi is the better way to go here as they give you generous amounts of it and is pretty good.  I suggest the albacore tataki or the yellowtail.  Make friends and have a great time....but be sure to have a designated driver or take a taxi if you plan to drink heavy here as it's pretty far back to the strip."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have ever had in Las Vegas. For that reason when we purchased a house, we were glad to know we were moving closer to I Love Sushi. The owner is always in there, working so hard and really helps facilitate the movement and feeling of the place. There's not a big turn around with the sushi chefs or employees. Always a good sign. We have become regulars"}
{"text":"Well done sushi! The place is clean and was not busy on a Saturday night! Good cheese wonton, dinner they have California salad very taste! Overall good place to eat and I was impressed with the variety of sushi! They have one which the roll is a cucumber, very different I liked!"}
{"text":"There are plenty of details about specific dishes/rolls in the previous reviews so I'll keep this succinct by saying this is probably one of the top 5 sushi places we've ever been too. It is not a traditional sushi house, per se, but the food is fun, the combination of flavors are delicious and it's a nice indulgence. If you're a sushi snob with an iron rod up your asshole this is not the place for you, but if you are chill enough to enjoy good food you'll love I Love Sushi."}
{"text":"Nondescript strip mall, go inside and love the Japanese themed decor. Waitresses wear the garb too. I don't know how they work in those dang shoes tho!  The burn your stomach roll was awesome, definately my fave. The salmon sashimi was really good as well.  The menu item names were entertaining."}
{"text":"Being that this is Las Vegas, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from the sushi restaurant. But I love sushi turned out to be a great find. The atmosphere was traditional Japanese, the service was excellent, and the sushi was very fresh. Each dish was prepared with great care and presented beautifully. The only Reason I didn't give this five stars is because they were a little heavy-handed on the sauce which covered up from the freshness of the sushi itself."}
{"text":"Talk about \"under-rated\"! This place was great! Probably going to come back tomorrow for breakfast! The Crunchy Roll was good. Didn't find the California Roll right away on the menu so just asked for it! Chef knew what I wanted and it was fabulous! I am such a traditionalist!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!!!!  If you go over the weekend be prepared a bit of a wait.  I am a huge sushi fan and this place rates top for me!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are kind of obsessed with the AYCE deal at one particular sushi place in town so we kind of had to force ourselves to try something new. We decided on I Love Sushi thanks to the great reviews!  We went for lunch so it was pretty quiet and our food came out pretty quickly. They have a HUGE menu with lots of unique specialty rolls. We had one that was drenched in a garlic butter sauce which was absolutely horrible for us but tasted delicious.  We tried some plain nigiri and I was pleased by the quality and freshness of the fish- it was pretty fantastic. But the price was a bit high for everything we got and since I am a mega sushi pig, I want to eat a lot of sushi! Still, the interesting menu selection would be enough to bring me back for lunch or something in the future."}
{"text":"Great sushi always fresh and tasting good. Staff is very nice and super helpful. The cook is very knowledgeable and always recommended stuff that I ended up liking. Prices are fair for the area. There are several sushi places in this part of town and this is the best palace I have tried. Super clean and hours and good."}
{"text":"The service here is on point. I was checked on pretty often, but not so often that it was obnoxious. Maybe because I was a pretty girl, sitting by herself at the sushi bar (forever alone).. haha I kid.   I decided to treat myself to some sushi after a nice evening walk by MacDonald Highlands. I was supposed to eat whatever I wanted as my cheat meal for a really restrictive high protein, essentially no carbs, diet. I ended up ordering seared tuna that was served with half an avocado and marinated red onions... essentially not what I was supposed to do. But man, it was really good. A++ would order again."}
{"text":"Eric- sushi chef gave me the most delicious screaming organism :)  He made sure I was happy with the service , my meal and my visit.  Its nice to get individual attention when you sit at the sushi bar alone. Its not so lonely after all. I frequent often and this place is just a hit!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was a let down. Service was extremely slow. Everything from getting our order in, getting our food, and getting the bill took way too long. The server checked on our table only once.  They don't have AYCE as an option. The rolls were priced higher than most places, but the rolls were a little bigger.   I ordered the D.C. roll and the Happy Ending roll. They were ok, nothing that made me say \"omg this is so good\" more like \"eh, I've had better\" haha. The D.C. roll had soft shell crab in it, which is my favorite thing, but I did not like it in this roll. It left a burnt flavor in the roll like it was fried for too long. If you order this roll I also do not recommend pouring all of the special sauce on it at one time. I made that mistake and it was just too much for the roll. The Happy Ending also had a lot going on, they burnt the soft shell crab in this roll too. It was good, but I think next time I would stick to a regular Japanese lasagna roll.  I was in the area and wanted to give it a try because of the reviews... but im very picky about my sushi places so I don't see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Friday night. I've been eating a lot of sushi lately and couldn't resist trying out another place. I have to say that this place was interesting because the waitresses actually wear kimonos and have accents. My server was pretty sassy which made things even more enjoyable lol. I tried the Ryan's roll which was pretty good. It reminded me of a standard crunchy roll, but this one cost like $15, so I don't know if I would get it again. The Screaming Orgasm was really good too and the small portion was only $10. The seared tuna was good and I would probably get it again. I liked it because it was fresh (not like some places with the chewy or stale looking fish), had a slightly spicy aftertaste, and had a bunch of sprouts and stuff which made me feel healthy. It was pretty busy so you know that is a good sign."}
{"text":"Fairly good sushi spot ..especially for lunch in the area servers are nice and place is pretty clean .I recommend it for lunch ."}
{"text":"We had the special garlic shrimp dish. It was amazing. The sushi was very fresh and delicious and the service was great ...very attentive. We have a new favorite sushi place to go now!"}
{"text":"Bam Bam roll and shishito peppers were perfect. Love this little spot when Im in Vegas. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Wife and I have ate here multiple times. Never disappoints. It's moderately priced, however, it is the best sushi within the area. If you sit at the bar, try to get a seat by Simon. He's one of the sushi chefs (Itamae) and he makes the entire experience real fun.   Go-to rolls: Monkey Roll I love sushi Kitchen Sink Garlic butter special  It gets real busy during the weekends...make that reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"(Brown rice sushi) I love I love sushi even though this place is packed on weekends!! It's worth the wait. I am trying to be health conscious when I can be so I love that they can make sushi with brown rice. I don't know any other sushi joint in Henderson or Vegas that can make sushi with brown rice. Their fish is always fresh tasting. The waitresses are nice. Sometimes I get a little rude attitude when it's super busy, but it's OK. If someone know other good places that can make brown rice, please let me know."}
{"text":"Holy cow. I was recently given a Zagat Book and was taking a trip to Vegas so I figured why not check out a reasonable priced Zagat rated restaurant. This place has made me a believer of Zagat. First the service is incredible. They are attentive, fast (but not too fast), and overall professional. The decor was super cute with the waitresses wearing kimonos and authentic attire. But that's all fine and dandy. The food. The sushi. Holy cow. So good. We got...  Tastes like my ex girlfriend  Double d's Bam bam The kitchen sink Burn your stomach   The kitchen sink was my favorite but they were all incredible. We probably go to sushi twice a month and are always trying different places but this is hands down the best sushi I've ever had and for an incredible price as well!! Next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been to.  Great service, amazing food and the selection is outstanding. Great if you love sushi or even looking to expand your horizon."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Two times, too many! We waited an hour after ordering 4 rolls and 2 box dinners an and a shooter. Our kids box dinners came out and no rolls, the waitress kept apologizing, but no resolution. We finally cut our losses and left, $60 bucks short without food for us.  We talked to the manager, just \"sorry\" \"sorry\". BTW- the table next to us sat down after us, ordered, eat and paid in this time. Whatever the situation, at the very least we shouldn't of had to ask for the manager and they should have taken care of part of the bill. The sushi there is good at best, but nothing to write home about or is worth putting up with such terrible service."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants in all of Vegas. The menu is a never ending choice of creativity and flavor. Sake selection is one of the best off strip. A bit pricey but worth treating yourself. Note they don't have AYCE."}
{"text":"This might be some of the best sushi I've had so far in the Valley.  I had the crunch and monkey roll.  Amazingly good as was the other items I sampled at our table.   The menu is extensive as our the portions.  No AYCE option but I didn't think the price was bad for what you get.  My only complaint is that they don't have a spot closer to me!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! The tuna tataki salad is my fav but there is a huge variety of fancy rolls as well as more traditional fare. I have also had great take-out experiences from here as well (fast and carefully packaged)."}
{"text":"Just a quick review: For solid sushi, this place is great. They don't participate in AYCE, like most local spots do--this is the place you want to go to for a fun, energetic environment and very good quality fish! The service has always been spot on and the dishes are great. Being that sushi can get very pricey, I typically order one of the Entree's and a couple rolls, to share. The Entree's are very reasonably priced and they bring you a lot of food. My favorite roll is the Joe's Special! A MUST!!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Sushi in town. The service is great and the pricing is perfect."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Food is unique and delicious. The service is awesome.    We will be back here soon."}
{"text":"Delish ... amazing options. .. highly recommend the screaming orgasm! very authentic, waitress dressed in kimonos & hot towels delivered on arrival :)"}
{"text":"edwin is the best sushi chef this place is the best sushi place i've ever been too ..the screaming orgasm  is so yummy it's seared tuna with sum yummy sauce love this place ..  love the sushi chef EDWIN..."}
{"text":"If you've been patronizing this restaurant since 2010 like I have. You have probably noticed lately that the waitstaff are incredibly rude and the sushi is not as good. That's because ownership was sold 4-5 months ago. This place has gone completely downhill. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over two years now and it's always consistent. You can find me here once a week usually Saturday nights. A couple of our favorites are Sexy Time, Double D, Frankie Special and Gary Special. Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm the first to review this place... Silly name - Awesome sushi, gets crowded at dinner time... Lots of exotic rolls available, but they nail the basics.. Best I've found in Vegas..."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had our first date here since our 7 month old baby was born. Service was awesome! Food really wonderful. We started with cucumber salads and miso soups. We also shared a spicy tuna roll that I'm craving seven days later!! I ordered the salmon skin salad that took a little longer than my husband's meals, but it was worth the wait!  It was larger than I had anticipated, so I ended up not ordering anything else after that. We plan to return as soon as our relatives return to babysit our baby girl!"}
{"text":"We went to this place because Spoon & Fork was full. It was pretty good. They had around 200 items and they were different and good. You have to get the Spicy Shrimp, and the Raman. Oh yes only All you can eat Sushi place that also gave you a good variety of Ramen noodles"}
{"text":"I have been to several sushi spots all around Vegas and around the country and this is my absolute favorite place to eat sushi. I like to do all you can eat but sadly this place doesn not offer AYCE  suchi so it can get pretty expensive. If you ever go I recommend you try the screaming orgasm... you wont regret it."}
{"text":"The sushi here is delicious, there are many different selections and they're all SO GOOD!! the only thing that sucks baaaad is the service."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi spot in town. The sashimi is fresh and the service is great. My only tip is that they tend to over sauce some of their rolls so it's a good idea to ask for the sauce on the side."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon I Love Sushi when I punched in my postal code in orderit.ca for delivery in my area. I do love sushi, so I decided to try this place.   The rice in the rolls was mushy, causing the rolls to fall apart easily. The beef teriyaki was very dry, I mean where's the teriyaki?!  After my first order from orderit.ca, I gave I Love Sushi another chance by calling in my order. On their menu, they state $15 or more for free delivery. I had some difficulty placing my order over the phone due to language barrier and was charged for delivery even though I ordered more than $15 worth of food.   In addition, upon inspection on the Dinesafe Toronto website (which I should have done before ordering), I discovered that I Love Sushi has received Conditional Passes (yellow) twice in the last year and a half by Dinesafe.   Needless to say, I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I Love...My Ass, Screaming Orgasms, Honey Rolls, and so much more.  The screaming orgasm is a gateway to serious sushi addictions. For the virgins out there, it's seared ahi tuna served on a bed of shredded radish and topped with a ponzu sauce. If you're burnt out on orgasms, try the spicy, crispy rice plate, under \"fried rolls.\"   The spicy tuna and crab mixes are so good that I suggest you try them straight up in hand rolls, which are gigantor. If you're not afraid to swap saliva, buddy up on these. But do not cut them in half. I repeat, do not cut hand rolls in half. That would be like lobbing the head off of a Virgin Mary figurine.   For dessert, get the honey roll. Somehow this fried salmon roll tastes better than custard.  On top of all the sexy names and delicious sauces, the waitresses wear kimonos and repeat your order with humor, \"So, you want I love my ass?\" Yes, yes I do."}
{"text":"What can we say... I LOVE Sushi is our refuge at the  of the week! If we miss a week, we feel out of sorts! Why??? Because the service & food is top Notch! Best chefs & ladies in waiting!   Your constant companion,  ~deirdra"}
{"text":"Definitely tasty, but not worth 5 stars in my opinion. They have a LOT of sushi roll items (about 100+) but in my opinion, that's WAY too many. It always takes me forever to go through the menu and after awhile, all the rolls sound the same.   Service is good and the sushi chefs are nice, but the menu is a bit overwhelming."}
{"text":"I've been going to I Love Sushi for awhile, it's always been my favorite but today was a different story. We don't get to indulge on sushi often, it's a treat when we're able to afford to go eat sushi. Today my husband and I were excited to go to our spot to get some sushi, sadly it was the worst I've had in a long while.. my salmon was SUPER fishy and even my california roll was fishy, how does that even happen? My husband wasn't as displeased with his roll or his yellowtail, but it definitely wasn't on par with our previous visits. I don't know if it was an off day or if this place is going down hill. To be completely honest, we probably won't be back. They don't offer AYCE so everything is a bit pricey, in my opinion if you're not going to offer AYCE you need to make sure your fish is fresh. Can I also mention it was a Saturday? Wouldn't you expect the weekend the fish would be the most fresh because of how much traffic they get on a weekend? I won't be recommending I Love Sushi anymore :("}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They burst my sushi cherry and I've been addicted ever since! The screaming orgasm is amazing and the green tea tempura ice cream is great!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!  Upon arriving in Vegas, our family brought us here for the \"best sushi ever\".  Could this be true? We were soon to find out!  The restaurant was crowded, very lively, and luckily we had a reservation so we got right in.   Our cousin is pretty much a sushi snob, so he ordered all our entrees. We started out with saki to salute our dining adventure. First on the menu was the Screaming O (seared tuna with mayonnaise sauce on a bed of radish). It was pure delight!!  I highly recommend it! Next we had garlic albacore & garlic tuna. Both fantastic. Next up Kiss of Fire and Who's Your Daddy (both on the spicy side). They were definitely crowd pleasers. Last entree was The Grand Canyon Roll - a great finish to the meal.  Everything was very fresh, good temperature contrast and great presentation.   We discovered that they had Green Tea Tempura ice cream and we were full but just couldn't resist. We devoured it!!  We had a great experience and it stands up to the hype!! It's no joke!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is SUPERB!! Staff is friendly and it's always filled with familiar faces who go back to eat there on a regular basis!! I love restaurants that serve great food and feel like home!! I Love Sushi is that place!!"}
{"text":"Love it. It's fishy in all the right ways  I'm a little biased here because I met my now fianc√©e here. But personally I have eaten at many sushi places and this one is definitely one of the better ones. The fish tasted fresh, I never had to ask for water refills and the atmosphere was pleasant."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks old, the service was really bad, the girl even served us salmon without soya sauce, everything tastes like leftover. My friend said it just because i read the reviews and i was obsessed with those, but no, it was actually the worst sushi i have ever had. When my friend was paying he was about to pay $2 for tips despite the fact that everything was so bad, but no option for \"amount\", just by percent, 15, 25 or 30% in total. Such a horrible place, i dont want to be mean, but sometimes we cant get what we pay especially in this case. If i can rate it 0 star, i would love to do it."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi joint in town.  Holy yum just thinking about it makes me hungry.  First of all if you go to I love sushi and don't order the Lisa handroll you're crazy because it is cone shaped heaven, like I could probably just eat those for the rest of my life!! Anywhooo I also enjoy their Double D roll and screaming orgasm appetizer,  not to mention they have ridiculously fresh sashimi.  They do not have AYCE which is kind of a bummer but everythings very high quality so I get it (Sushi Mon had delicious AYCE)  It get super busy though so I would suggest making a reservation.  Also their waitresses have always been very sweet and attentive I don't think I've ever had a bad experience there.. happy eating!"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Vegas 4 months ago from FL. We have been searching for sushi like this since we lived on the west coast of FL! We lived on the east coast of FL for 9 years and we had a sushi joint that we loved. They served a spicy crab roll, which is NOT a complicated roll but we have not been able to find a single sushi place that served this roll in 2 years. . .until we went to I Love Sushi last night! This place is our new go to sushi joint. We had the Jackpot Special, spicy crab roll and eel and tuna sushi. The red tuna filets were as fresh and yummy as you can get. The rolls were fantastic and the service was superb. I'm pretty sure that the sushi chefs have \"I Dream of Genie\" powers because as soon as we ordered, our rolls were on the table made exactly as we ordered them. The prices are in line with what we're used to paying and the menu has a good variety of choices. We'll definitely be back. . .and it's absolutely worth drive to Henderson from the Strip."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!  If you want some incredible sushi, fly to Las Vegas. Was just absolutely incredible. Would I fly back to Vegas from Seattle just to eat here. Oh, hell yeah!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The atmosphere is amazing, I love how the staff wear authentic Japanese kimonos. The food was delicious and the prices are very reasonable. We will definitely be making this our go-to sushi spot in Henderson. Great service too. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We live in LA and go here with a group of 40 friends every year as a special outing. The staff is so accommodating and fun it's amazing, given how chaotic serving 40 people at once could be.  The sushi is always great and the names of the rolls are a lot of fun.  Everything I've tried has been top notch, and with 40 people along I figure I've tried about everything."}
{"text":"Had the burning your stomach roll and it was enjoyable.  Difficult to tell the quality of the sushi since there was so much sauce and mixed with other items but definitely tasty."}
{"text":"Very ordinary restaurant. The food is very so so. If you want to enjoy your food then don't go there.  The staff was present only at order and to pay. In between you will not see anyone.   At payment, I recommend to not pay cash as you will not get your change back.   Its a well deserved 1 star. Don't bother to stop there."}
{"text":"This is the sushi place that I tell everyone about. It is \"Americanized\" sushi in an \"authentic\" environment.\" (if that makes any sense) There are lots of unique rolls of which I highly recommend the \"cherry blossom\" and the \"screaming orgasm!\" It is Korean owned but you will be greeted in Japanese. lol The TVs in contrast are always set to American sports. The waitresses are  adorable, dressed in kimonos, and are very helpful once you figure out how to communicate what you want. Good service, amazing food and reasonable prices consistently make \"I love sushi\" worth the 15 minute drive off the Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Nasty sushi that tastes like the garbage you can buy pre-made at the supermarket. The simulated crab was the biggest turn off."}
{"text":"It was ok , but I had better sushi  i just wish they had a revolving sushi place here in Las vegas very hard to find one out here ."}
{"text":"This place has some ridiculous names for their sushi, but it's entertaining to talk about.  The waitresses are good looking.  The sushi's very good.  This place has really good miso soup, and the sushi tastes fresh.  They also have some very unique dishes.  I'm a big fan of this place."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was amazing!! The fish was fresh and the presentation was outstanding!  Our servers were very attentive and informative for our decisions.  Very unique sushi combos and the flavors are crave worthy!  A return visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Had a really great dinner here the other day with a group of friends! Food was really good and pretty quick to come! My only complaint was that service aside from food delivery was slow at times, felt like the wait staff hid behind the counter a lot and never really checked in with us to see how we were doing.   Overall still a great dine out!"}
{"text":"I love I Love Sushi. My favorite sushi place. Kitchen Sink, Tuna Tartar, Screaming Orgasm, Spicy Salmon Roll, and age dashi tofu are my favorites. Get fresh wasabi."}
{"text":"I love sushi is hands down the best sushi spot in Vegas!!! The place is always packed so be prepared for that!!! The service is fast though so you never have to wait long!!! The food is fresh. They have a variety of options. A few of my favorites...Cherry Blossom, Joes Special and the Screaming Orgasm. Consistency is the key here!!! Food is always AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and lively. The design is a campy but flashy asian decor. Some may say its tacky, but I love the camp factor. The service is very attentive, but a bit rushed and comes off a little pushy. The food.... veggy tempura was mediocre, shrimp tempura as poor, the chicken teriyaki was ok, the beef teriyaki was bad, and the halibut tempura was poor. The sushi rolls just very average. We did not order any specialty rolls. The sashimi was good. Maybe we should have tried the specialty rolls... I was unimpressed."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the state! We have ordered so many different dishes and they are all outstanding. I would eat here every day if possible. 10 stars."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi in Nevada? Yeah, its not just theory anymore. I visited \"I Love Sushi\" because of its stellar ratings (and I was lost). I used to seeing 4 star reviews for places, but the reviews on Yelp were a whole other matter. When everyone is raving about specific sushi chefs, -BY NAME - you have to know something is great.  I am so glad I tried this place. The little extra's are great. Hand towels, exceptional service. Even when you sit down, people all around you are talking to the chef by name. Crazy! I love it.   Each roll was exceptional. I actually ordered 2 more than I could eat because I loved it so much. I am a pretty picky person when it comes to sushi, but each roll was better than the last.   Hands down one of the best sushi places in Vegas. Check it out."}
{"text":"This Sushi restaurant is by far the BEST.  Their rolls are delish!  It's a clean restaurant with great ambiance!  I highly recommend this place.  I've been to many, many sushi restaurants.  This has been my favorite so far.  It doesn't matter if it's Korean owned.  In fact, I think the Korean owned sushi restaurants are better.  90% of sushi restaurants are Korean owned anyway.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So I guess I recently went on a sushi splurge. What can I say? I love sushi! Hah  This place was hustling and bustling the Friday night that I came. We had a group of 8 people and they accommodated all of us very nicely in one booth. It was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect. It's a sushi/Japanese restaurant run by Koreans with waitresses in kimonos. Interesting..   Let's start off by the saying that the specialty sushi roll menu is.. well.. extensive. Like really extensive. There are so many options.. maybe too many options for my indecisiveness haha.. The sushi was not bad though. I ordered the Ryan roll which was basically a crunchy shrimp tempura roll with maguro and special sauce. It was quite tasty.  Our service was great! Considering how busy the place was, our server was really attentive and fun.   So why just the 4 stars? I was a little thrown back by the price of the rolls. My roll was $15 already. I was a little disappointed to find out they didn't have a AYCE option but it is what it is. (I think people from Hawaii are just too spoiled with cheap food) They also have bento boxes/dinner specials that also looked yummy. I would give those a try if I come back next time!"}
{"text":"Made my order online and when arrived to pick up my order it wasn't ready. Boss man said he didn't look at his phone. Food is pretty bad quality. Ordered some sashimi tuna(stinks like old fish), Angus beef stake( wasn't tender) I'm sure they gave me a cheap cut of beef, and a pork cuttlet ( very dry and over cooked). I would have gave half star if I had the choice."}
{"text":"I finally was in Henderson. I have been trying to get to this place for a while and finally the day came and I have to say it was not disappointed.   Located in back of a strip mall off of eastern  ave. As soon as we walked in we were greeted. The waitresses are in kimonos which is kind of cool as for the decor it feels like you in Japan. Their booths are closed which is nice and intimate if you have a date. Service was great as well kept the refills coming and always asked if everything was ok.   As for the food the fish quality was really good fish melted in my mouth had the screaming orgasm, chef special roll both equally as good. I just wish they were closer to Summerlin.   Def will be back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Omg this place has the best spicy sushi I have ever had. The \"burning your stomach\"  is a delicious blend of fresh fish with mouth burning sauces that aren't overpowering or take the flavor away from the fish. It's amazing and I can't even explain how quickly and efficiently they churn out their rolls. Very fast and very competent service. I have been to many sushi places and they are very fast paced and getting your roll order wrong has been fairly common for me. Not the case at all here.   You want good food and amazing, ORIGINAL SPICY rolls, this is the place for it."}
{"text":"Name is cheesy but food is good.  I'm a fan of all-you-can-eat, but my sister and friends convinced me to give this place a try.  We were greeted by a kimono-clad hostess/server, which was a nice touch and sat in a wooden, semi-enclosed booth.  There is an extensive list of sushi rolls with extraordinary names!  Very non-traditional, but still yummy.  I ordered the bento box with teriyaki salmon and some kind of mackerel.  It came with a little bowl of rice and a tempura rice ball, which was unique and of course miso soup and salad.  Also ordered a pepper tuna plate, which I shared with my hubby.  It was slices of pepper tuna in a yummy ponzu-like sauce.  Delicious.  Fish was fresh and service was good.  This place is way on the other side of the world, but I would definitely go again if my sister was so inclined! :)"}
{"text":"If you don't want the usual \"All you can eat\" sushi then this is the place for you. The rolls are very flavorful and taste delicious."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi restaurant on this side of town. The menu is extensive but it's all good. Anything on the menu with yellowtail is my favorite. I've been for lunch only a couple of times and their specials are well-priced. Dinner can get pricey. Make sure to make reservations for dinner because it can get quite busy at night."}
{"text":"Had dinner here based off the reviews, gave it three stars for uniqueness and atmosphere. Overall sushi was ok, bit heavy and over sauced. Some ingredients didn't seem fresh or were overcooked. Lots of rolls to choose from, I'd probably got to SushiMon their rolls are a bit more well made, and service is better. We had to wait for drink refills a lot and they brought out all the rolls at once so the hot entrees chilled before we could eat them."}
{"text":"So I ignored all the bad delivery reviews, because this place is near my office and though I'd go eat in. I don't often say stay away - but stay away from this place. The seaweed salad was tough, and parts of it were frozen. Yuck. The tuna sushi had actually gone bad - had this mushy, glue-like texture and a funky taste. Had to spit it out. When I told the waitress she giggled and said she'd never tried it. I tried to explain that it was actually bad, as in rotten, and she just walked away. Gross."}
{"text":"Amazing and fast service!  Great atmosphere.  Definitely will be going back soon.  Prices we great, plus they were very accommodating with our young children.  They brought out their food first and fast.  Super nice staff."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I were recommended to I Love Sushi and went for our anniversary. The fish was fresh and all of the rolls were perfect! We will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi restaurant.  Great sushi, fun rolls with fun names, and excellent service.  James, the owner, is hands on and runs the place very efficiently.  He makes sure tables are cleared quickly and service is smooth.  It gets busy often, but they turn tables quickly.  It also has a fun energy to it!"}
{"text":"I Love Sushi is OK.  Not bad, but really just ok.  I've had so many people tell me its so good and...eh.  I was totally underwhelmed when I went.  It's definitely a cute place, and their menu is huge.  But the menu items aren't that different from each other.  I found myself flipping the menu over a bunch to see what the difference between a couple rolls were.  I think it would be good if you are going with a large group and you're more concerned with having fun than eating awesome sushi."}
{"text":"I will definitely venture out here again when we visit Las Vegas! Everything was delicious and the place was packed but we didn't have to wait long. The sashimi salad has an amazing dressing. Their rolls maybe a little too much sauce on it but other than that a super yum sushi experience!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I took a friend there for his birthday  and they were awesome  and the food is always good, professional staff, timely service, always checking back if anything is needed!  It was so cool they brought my friend out cake and ice cream with a candle and we sang happy birthday!  He loved it!  A must go, it's a superb place to eat!"}
{"text":"my taste buds had an amazing experience! i got 4 different items and they were all as good as i was expecting after ready the reviews! it was a busy night but the owner took 5 min to  get us situated. if you like flavor thats for sure the good spot!"}
{"text":"Great change of pace from the countless AYCE places in town. You can definitely taste the difference in both quality and freshness of the fish."}
{"text":"Fabulous sushi, wonderful. The food was excellent, and the atmosphere was very authentic. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I truly love this place. We are spoiled. When we go get sushi anywhere else, it never compares to I Love Sushi. They are the best. Great staff and great food. Bam Bam Special is amazing. Also, try a Sexy Time... very nice."}
{"text":"Maybe we were there on an off night, because our experience was terrible. My husband and I arrived on a Wednesday night for dinner. We had a table for 2, and the restaurant was not overly busy. Our server was polite, and continually checked on us, which is great. We placed our order, my husband ordered from the hibachi, and I ordered 2-rolls, and we ordered saki. Nothing too crazy or out of the ordinary.  My husband received his meal within about 5-10 minutes after placing the order, but it came out without the rice. No big deal, we can live with that. The meal was hot, and looked fine. The taste was fine, but the meat was very tough. Again, we can kinda live with that, hey tough met happens. We waited and waited for my order to come through...and waited...and waited....  We were watching the sushi bar the entire time, and there were sushi chefs available to make our remaining order, so we thought, maybe our order got lost. Our waitress returned when my husband was almost done with his meal and brought the rice she forgot to bring out during the first arrival of his food. Rice was very bad.  My order finally came 45-minutes later. Let that sink in. 45-minutes later. 2-rolls. They were absolutely horrible. I love sushi. I love sashimi. The rolls tasted like really bad rotten fish, and even had the rotten smell. I gagged with the first bite, and thought maybe it's in my head. I tried bite number two and lost it. The waitress returned and she asked \"Do you not like your meal?\" I responded by saying what I thought, and she said \"Thank you for being so nice to me, most people want the manager, thank you.\" At this point I just wanted taco bell. She didn't offer a refund or to even give a discount. We didn't ask. We had already spent almost 2-hours there and walked out paying $60 for a horrible experience.  By the way, this was our 3rd time there, and it was only my first experience that was great. The sushi chef was Joe, and we sat at the bar. He was not there the other two times, so maybe he's the key to the success? I don't know, but we will not return. :("}
{"text":"The place can be really busy so recommend visiting on off nights or off dinner hours.  The sushi is always fresh and the have some interesting dishes.  We have been here several times and it has become our fav sushi spot in the valley for quality at off-strip prices."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere  Great place to introduce sushi to a hesitant consumer"}
{"text":"I have to say that \" I Love Sushi \" is definitely one of the best that I have tried in this town to date.  Food was Very good, service was also Very good.  I will go back and I am going back next week!"}
{"text":"Tried this sushi for the first time. It is not an all you can eat. We order the salad screaming orgasm and few rolls ( menu of rolls is huge ) and it was fresh and delicious. The ambiance of this restaurant is nice and spacious. Service was a little bit slow but it was at the same time of the CES convention and the restaurant was packed. I will be back for sure next time i am in Henderson"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I usually avoid coming here with friends because they do not offer AYCE. However, their grade of fish is a little better than most sushi places, their portions are a little bigger, and in my opinion you get fuller faster! I find myself having to eat so many rolls to get full at other places! Here, I get stuffed from one Japanese Lasagna roll and maybe an order of calamari (so 'all you can eat' is not necessary).   When I'm craving Japanese Lasagna I HAVE to get it from here! They have the best. Today, I decided to order a Cherry Blossom (no rice) and a Japanese Lasagna! The Cherry Blossom was incredible and HUGE!! I was full after eating half of it.  I don't think you can go wrong with anything from the menu :)"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday. I was seated quickly wait staff was excellent. But the sushi was over priced and not very good. I had the monkey roll and the salmon lover no rice they were 12.00 each not impressed I won't be going back"}
{"text":"This might be a biased review because I have only been here once during the hot lunch hour.  My friend and I were seated for about 15 minutes with our menus down and ready to order w/ out a peep from any of the waitresses.  I was already displeased with this considering, I had to go back to work within a certain timeframe.  I hate when lunch hours take longer than they should!  And the restaurant was not even full!  Boo!  Second, our orders took awhile to come out and we ONLY ordered 2 rolls, a salad, and an appetizer. Really?  That should not have taken very long to come out!  I was fairly disappointed.    Good thing the waitress was always apologetic.  We ordered the Garlic Chili Pepper Edamame, best edamame appetizer I've ever had.  Loved it!  We also ordered the rainbow roll; it was fresh and good tasting.  The crispy spicy tuna rice cake was amazing.  Has a nice jalapeno kick to it and definitely something I would come back for.  Their sashimi salad was ok; fish wasn't as fresh as I would have liked it, and I'm not too fond of their salty special sauce.  I might be back to try more rolls before I give up on this place.  There are just so many good sushi joints in the Southwest area to come back here.  We'll see!  Stay tuned!  Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (45/365)."}
{"text":"Love this place! It has a wide variety of options which will surely satisfy any kind of sushi you're craving. They were easily able to bring us separate checks for our rolls as well, which has been an issue at so many other restaurants.  Our server noticed some gifts on the table for a birthday we were celebrating and she brought out some ice cream for us all free of charge without us even asking which I was really impressed by. She really went above and beyond. We also stuck around for a couple of hours after we finished our meal because I hadn't seen my friends in a while and we were catching up. Granted it wasn't really a busy night, our server didn't try to shoo us away or make us feel bad for lingering. Overall, great food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend loves the sushi here and they have a large selection of other things for people with me that can't stand fish and sushi.  Place gets very busy and crowded at times so you may want to come early or at non peak times."}
{"text":"I must say I have been to many sushi restaurants in many different states.  My son and I are very picky about sushi.  We found \"I LOVE SUSHI\" a few months ago and I am not exaggerating when I say I am there 3 to 4 times a week. The owner Milton is the most friendly and inviting man and the staff, especially Alice are all so sweet, kind and friendly. And the food.  OH WOW. The food is amazing. Never disappointed. I am in Awe of this place. I cannot get enough. I bring all my friends. Sometimes I am embarrassed about how many times a week I am there however I am just going to be me and do it!  Thank you I LOVE SUSHI and yes, I will see you tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I divide sushi into 2 different kinds: First, there are the restaurants devoted to serving fresh raw fish, prepared very simply, highlighting the flavors of the fish. Then, there are the restaurants that serve AYCE, or various fried rolls, or rolls with lots of different sauces, or rolls with weird sexual names.  I love sushi falls into this second category. It's not that it's bad - actually, I thought it was quite good - but don't go there expecting a great meal of nigiri and sashimi. Instead, order your 'screaming orgasm' and your 'sushi nachos' and enjoy them....and order some extra yum yum sauce on the side."}
{"text":"I eat here ALOT and can't believe I am just now reviewing this place.  This is truly a great sushi spot.  Although it is not AYCE, I think for the quality of fish, it is perfectly priced.  I never leave here feeling like I overpaid.   Every roll is cut into huge pieces.  If you have a small mouth (like myself), it makes for some interesting eating trying to cram a whole piece into your mouth.  But it's also very filling!  I'ved tried the majority of the rolls at this place.  Here are a list of my favorites:  Kiss of Fire - Very spicy.  This is one of my favorite rolls I've had anywhere Franky Special - Just the right amount of spicy and sweet Burning my stomach - This thing is hot!! love it! Tastes Like My X-Girlfriend - Got to love the names of some of these rolls, but this is very good.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  I've been here on a Tuesday, Friday, Saturday and I've never had a problem getting a table, but it is always crowded.  The service, this means everyone from the door person to the chefs, is excellent!  I love the atmosphere here, too.  It's very lively and has kind of a bar feel which really adds to the experience.    I don't care if my Japanese food is prepared and served by Koreans.  Good food is good food!  One word of caution:  this place does go kind of heavy on the sauce, so if that is not your thing, you may not love this place as much as I do."}
{"text":"I am very picky about my sushi. This is the first sushi place where I do not have to order a backup plate ( chicken dish or yakisoba or something). I love the kiss of fire or the Gary's special. Drink several bottles of nigori every time. Crunch roll and California roll are very good. Also the himachi is out of control. So soft and buttery. Will be back many more times. Best sushi I've had!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was great, service was stellar and the food was divine! I brought my 4 year old along without any trouble, but it would be great for a bubbly happening date spot too. I can't wait to head back and try the scallop shooters. We tried the chili garlic edamame to start and I'm so glad we did! I'm so glad I finally got to try this sushi spot. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with family (not my kids) and the food and service were great. Don't let your kids read the name of the rolls as they are R-rated but very entertaining.  I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best sushi I've ever had. Love the atmosphere there too. The traditional dresses add to the vibe."}
{"text":"Nice lunch today. Great service, Imagine a cool Japanese Bar, calm music. I ordered the Flower Roll, Japanese lasagna, Sashimi salad and of course the famous Screaming Orgasm  Excellent! The minus one star was for a better mochi and the decor is kinda cheesy for the pricey meal. However fun great place to enjoy good sushi!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sushi spot in Vegas. So lucky that i live 5 minutes away from this restaurant. I frequent this spot so much that they know that i like to sit at the bar and they already know my order when i sit down. How's that for service. Lucky for them i am a creature of habit. I order the spicy edamame right off the bat. Soooo good, and spicy! A Screaming orgasm is a MUST! i can handle a small on my own or I'll order a large to split with my date. Joe is my favorite sushi guy when i get there at night. If i go too early I'll miss him, but the other guys are pretty attentive and friendly. I always see someone i know there so i know this place has to be pretty popular. Every once and a while i will make a friend there. To all you newbies, i guarantee this will be your new hot spot! But prepare to wait for a table if you show up during prime time which is usually around 7. This place is poppin ny then. Totally worth the wait though."}
{"text":"The sushi here is really delicious. The fish is fresh and of good quality. They have a large selection of sushi rolls to choose from, most of them are creative and have a nice twist. They also have funny/ interesting names  I had the Crazy horse, and the monkey roll. So delicious. I love Philadelphia rolls so I picked these two because they had salmon and cream cheese. The monkey roll had so much flavor, beautifully presented. Basically a Philadelphia roll but with a twist as it has mango and \"red crunch\" on top with a sauce, I don't remember what it was though. The crazy horse was more simple but equally satisfying. It was tempura but it was a nice thin line not super thick like other places, and with that you get the full flavor of the inside (the salmon, cream cheese, ect)    My bf had the last call which had mozzarella and crab. It was surprisingly good considering cheese isn't traditional included in sushi, but it was different and delicious   The lobster roll was too plain for my taste but it was well made  Overall this place is awesome. The sushi is creative and of great quality, the sushi chefs are very friendly and are more than happy to recommend what sushi to get and are knowledgeable about what they're doing.  The decor is ok, nothing exceptional. The service is also whatevers, the waitress accidentally poked me in the face with my chopsticks while taking my plates away and only said a whispered sorry, but didn't really care.   Wish I had taken pics of the food but it was that good that I gobbled it up and forgot."}
{"text":"I never drove around Henderson before, but after looking for I Love Sushi, I realized it's a really nice residential area with TONS of eateries around! Definitely convenient if you're staying at South Point and don't feel like going on the strip or downtown.  I Love Sushi has a very Japanese-style interior which I liked since it makes it more authentic. They have literally HUNDREDS of different types of specialty rolls..not to mention unique (and sometimes embarrassing) names for them! No kidding, it was a little overwhelming to be quite honest, haha. We ended up ordering the Screaming Orgasm, I Love My Ass roll, and the Spider roll. I enjoyed all of them, but I think my favorite would have to be the I Love My Ass roll. Super savory and delicious! The Screaming Orgasm was definitely good, too - it's more like a salad though, just FYI. The rolls are a little pricey, but their portions are pretty generous IMO, so no complaints here! I left with a VERY happy belly :)  So yes, recommended and I would definitely not mind eating here again if I'm ever staying at South Point again."}
{"text":"It was packed when we walked in but they make sure you are seated in a timely manner. The sushi is good and fresh and the waiters are very nice. It's not ayce but after my wife and I ordered what we did and were full the price came out to almost the same it would if we did an ayce sushi place. Long story short good service and good sushi a must try."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing! Every dish had a wonderful aroma and exquisite taste. My favorite suchi restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give 3.5, but will be generous.    We ordered entrees rather than sushi.  We first shared the butter yaki appetizer with scallops.  I don't associate scallops with Japanese food so I don't really know why we ordered this, but OMG they were the most tender scallops I have ever eaten!  And the portion size was very generous, so we took half home.  They were still surprisingly tender after being reheated in a microwave four days later.  Wow!    The rest of our food was ok to very good, not spectacular.  We both ordered entrees that came with 2 main items.  My vegetable tempura was very good and the salmon teriyaki good, but my husband didn't like his two selections very well (mackerel and spicy chicken, both only ok).  However, the miso soup, salad and side dishes that come with the entrees were all good and we had a lot of food left over.  Overall, we were satisfied.  It was busy and we had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated.   It seemed noisy in the main/bar area, but luckily we ended up just to the left of the front door where it was a little quieter.  If we go back, which we probably will, we'll try the sushi because I suspect that's what they do best.  (Maybe the butter yaki again, too.)  But if we're in the mood for non-sushi entrees, we will probably stick with En Sushi."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant if I'm craving Japanese cuisine. Very fresh, fast and friendly service. I usually order sashimi and non-riced items.   Some of my favorite dishes ~   Hamachi Kama  Sashimi Salad Spicy Chicken Pepper Tuna  Dined here a number of times ~ the service, quality of food and cleanliness has been consistent."}
{"text":"I know it's slightly odd to have a sweet flavor of sushi in your mouth, but you have to try the Monkey Roll! (it has cream cheese and mangoes). Pretty much everything on their menu is fresh and delicious. I've had great service there every single time i've gone and the servers are always ready to assist you."}
{"text":"When it comes to presentation this place executes that one thing completely. The food tastes as good as it looks, but if you're on a budget this place my be out of reach depending on what's in your pocket. Even their establishment looks amazing. I love this place and love their \"screaming orgasm roll\"!"}
{"text":"My son and I went and liked it. We normally go to Sushimon but since we were in the east side of town, thought to try it. It wasn't all you can eat, but the amount of food we ate came out to what it would have cost at all you can eat. We ordered 3 full rolls each $10-14, and we also ordered a lunch special for $9 with tempura and chicken teriyaki, that include soup, and gyoza. We had a custom salmon roll that my son likes  and Gary's special roll and something else that my son ordered. Gary's roll was really great. I liked the sauce - sesame vinegar that was slightly spicy. The fish was really fresh. You can tell the difference. It wasn't fishy at all and was velvety. The lunch cost $51 without tip. It's a little more expensive than Sushimon but it was good. I'd go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi place! Great service and absolutely the best sushi place in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I would give zero if possible.   I read through all the reviews and the negative ones describe my experience to the T.   Terrible food, terrible service, sticky tables, weirdly limited menu unless you get all you can eat.   Avoid this place at all costs. I can't believe it's been in business so long.  If you are looking at this review and wondering if I'm just picky - look at my stats. This is the first place I've ever awarded ONE star to. Don't forget, I would have given it ZERO if possible."}
{"text":"My husband loves sushi, so it was his pick for date night and I Love Sushi was we're we went.  Located behind a Wendy's and a Black Bear Diner, we parked and went in and immediately noticed how packed it was. We we seated in one of the last free tables and edamame with soy sauce brought right over.  My husband ordered for us, putting in a few different choices. I am less adventurous than he when it comes to food, I keep my sushi pretty simple. California roll or tuna roll. My husband goes for the eel and octopus, with more intrepid ingredients.  All in all the sushi was good, and service too. Next time it's his pick for sushi I would be fine returning there.  The bill minus tip was $75."}
{"text":"I have been all over this lovely town of Las Vegas in search of a sushi place I can call home, and after nearly 5 years off and on, I have finally found it. I Love Sushi was AMAZING!!! From the two sided menu with endless amounts of creative goodness, to the hilarious names of the items (ex. Screaming Orgasm, The Threesome, etc.), to the timely and polite service from both the waitresses and sushi chef's, this place is great.  Enough seating that even when its busy, it shouldnt be too long of a way and the food comes out nearly as fast and fresh as when you order it.  Pricing is GREAT!  GO TO I LOVE SUSHI ASAP!!!"}
{"text":"I drive 25 miles across town at least three times a week passing 100+ other sushi restaurants.  I love for the Screaming O, Something Wrong 69, Jackpot Special, and Grand Canyon rolls.  The wait is never long, and if it were, it would be worth it."}
{"text":"A must! Try Kitchen sink and Gary's special rolls. People are very nice and super professional."}
{"text":"Not bad sushi.  My husband and I went there about 7:30 on a Friday and got in within 5 minutes, even though the restaurant was quite busy.  We got the Vegas (I know a strange thing for locals to get!) boat for 2 and a caterpillar roll.  I thought it was a bit pricey ($47 for 2); however, the portions were generous.  The two layers of beef in the beef teriyaki made it worth.  Not bad.  More than generous for two!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for the week, had to try this place based on the yelp reviews and interesting looking menu.  Variety was overwhelming, tried just a couple items and was full In no time.  Would have loved to try more .  My suggestion would be half roll option or sampler plates.  If your looking for variety they have it. Atmosphere  at lunch was quiet and comfortable."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this one day - thought I would give it a try.  Typical sushi place - sushi was pretty good. Price is decent.  Party trays are decent. =)"}
{"text":"It's good. Proportions and quality of food were regular. I enjoyed the decor and how the servers were dressed to represent the Japanese culture. Had the unagi bowl which came with a salad and the jackpot roll. After all the sushi I ate that day, every roll started to taste the same (I had ayce sushi at the Kaya restaurant earlier) so I can't rave about any of their rolls in particular because none of them stood out and that's not a bad thing...I just couldn't find anything that stood out exceptionally to give this place 5 stars. Anyways, try their garlic edamame."}
{"text":"If you asked me 2 years ago where the best sushi in town was I would say I love sushi easily. Unfortunately after going there at least 10 times in the past 2 years I have to say that the service has gotten progressively worse every single time.  Every time I feel like I have to say well, the sushi is still the best. Yes, the sushi is really good. 5 stars for the sushi. 1 star for the service.  They need a bigger restaurant, double the staff. It's too busy to do good business. I'm sure they make good money because there's no doubt about the sushi quality, but man I can do it anymore. I always try to go early so I could get a seat, you have to smash through people coming in the door. Then once seated it may take a really long time to place order. Then once order is placed you have to wait a really long time to get the food. You may want to order your second round of drinks ahead of time if you are drinking because it's going to be a long time before you see your server again. I can't really do this place anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Very consistent in quality of service and food. Service, in our opinion, is the best of all sushi places (off the Strip). Surprisingly, our favorite roll is Mistake roll (one of their cheapest), we love their oyster shooters too! The sashimi salad is terrible though (but it's more like an exception)."}
{"text":"I been to I love Sushi twice already in one month. A great place with a very busy but cosy environment. Sushi rolls are big portions and taste delicious!! The energy and the atmosphere is great at this place! Can't wait to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi Place in Las Vegas! My favorite rolls are the I love Sushi Roll, Tiger Roll and the Kitchen Sink with tuna! Always a great time! Best place in the house is dining at the Sushi Bar. My Fiance does not eat sushi, but always orders the spicy chicken with shrimp added! So Good!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant I have ever been too. The food is absolutely amazing and the staff treats you so well. We regularly come at least every other week if not every week and we always order the same things Nigiri sake . Spicy edamame . Pan fried gyoza. Nigiri . And then we always choose a roll. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Worth every 5* review. Friendly staff, Sake-bombs, great value.  Although they aren't on OpenTable we always work around that.  At every sushi place the most important things to me (in order) - Fresh fish - Excellent service - Cold mugs - Good happy hour / late night - Unique flavor combinations - On OpenTable so I don't have to wait for a table and so I can get my points - Chefs and staff who will pound 3-9 sake bombs with you.  I highly highly recommend I Love Sushi"}
{"text":"The sushi is Yum, but if you have to eat gluten free I wouldn't recommend it. They aren't too knowledgeable about Gluten Free and I always leave with a tummy in pain no matter how plain I get my food. They do have a gluten free soy sauce which helps, but the staff isn't too knowledgeable on it so be very careful. They are pretty pricey as well."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the Sushi Chef's were great to interact with. Worth the trip off the strip for the food."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great and fresh sushi  just darn good.   I ordered dynamite and a selection of other sushi rolls ... all were delicious   Even the restroom was cute ... so were the waitress staff ... up to par with Los Angeles for sure and cheaper !"}
{"text":"One of, if not the, best sushi joint in Las Vegas. Night out with the wife? Check. Lunch with the boss? Check. Catching up with friends? Check.   Amazing rolls, always fresh. Service is always easy. In the Green Valley area it's a place you need to visit. Personal favorites include the Cherry Blossom and the Candy Cane. Cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"The different spicy sushi rolls they have will get you going!!! Lots of spice. Great presentation and service as well :) One of the better off the strip environments you will find in town. A happening place. One negative is one of my rolls. It was a white albacore one. FISHY!!! First sushi roll that I've ever had that was this way... Still I've been here enough to go back."}
{"text":"I Love Sushi does not do AYCE.. Which would not be a problem for me if the sushi quality was better/the prices weren't so high. I ordered 1 roll and a small beer and ended up paying $19. My money would have been better spent at an AYCE elsewhere.  We made a reservation for a table of 8. Easy, no problem, on time. 7PM Thursday night and the place was PACKED- Play it safe and make a reservation! The waitresses are all dressed in cheap kimonos and are HORRIBLE. One of the waitresses came over and asked who ordered the 'Screamo' (the roll was called the 'Screaming Orgasm') The restaurant was loud, we were a party of 8- none of us claimed the roll. The waitress ended up getting extremely angry insisting that it was our roll. We eventually figured out which roll she was talking about apologized for not understanding, but come on. Why work at a restaurant with a ton of dirty names if you don't want to say them out loud? It wasn't our fault we thought you had a different roll!  The sushi boat with terriyaki, katsu, sushi we ordered was larger than expected and worth the price if you're going to be sharing with a large group.  Candy Cane: Yellowtail and tuna covered rolls that looks like a candy cane. Not too saucy, perfect amount of raw.  Kiss of fire: A popular roll but I'm unsure why. It's spicier than anything I've previously experienced and tastes only of sricha.  Overall the sushi=4, service=1."}
{"text":"The name is deceiving because you would think only sushi.  But they have udon, sukiyaki, tonkatsu, tempura.... and it's delicious!  The service is excellent!  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"After not having sushi for 3 months, I was craving some Japanese cooking. My friend and I walked into this place, very excited to sit down and feast. She ordered: Dynamite & Spicy Salmon Rolls, and being a veggie, I got myself the Spicy Vegetarian and Yam Tempura Rolls. Mind you we only paid $5.99 per person. Our food came out within 10 minutes. For being tiny girls, we both eat like Sumo Wrestlers...so we were afraid it wouldn't be enough. But, these rolls were well-made, and quite filling. For the price, service, and complimentary Miso Soup and Salad with an interesting dressing, we walked out quite satisfied. And, the set up/decor was cute for a lil hole in the wall. I wouldn't mind going back.  Check out their website for more pictures: http://www.ilovesushi.ca/gallery/index.html"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum! Get the dynamite roll. So good. I go here as often as I can. Try it!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the staff is very friendly and accommodating! We dine almost once a week and have had good experiences!"}
{"text":"I love sushi because this place is good,  name says it all!   Every Roll has a unique explosion of flavors that complement the fish each roll showcases.  Presentation is appetizing and the size is generous. The fish is fresh and rice is flavorful!    One of my favorite features in their rolls is the little crunchiness from the soft shell crab and/or shrimp tempura inside the roll.  My favorite rolls: Gary Special and Stuffed Tomato.  Lately I've been enjoying the Nabeyaki Udon soup served in a cast iron pot which is so nice during the cold days!   Been a regular customer for almost a decade!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I was introduced to I love sushi! Their restaurant ambiance/decor and servers are very authentic . I recommend I love sushi for people looking for a high quality meal willing to shell out the extra bucks. This place will not satisfy you if you are looking for $20 all you can eat establishment- this is not it. Their a la carte sushi rolls have a huge variety to choose from. I only noticed on my second visit some of their sushi rolls have naughty names which made me giggle. My two favorite rolls are the candy cane roll with soft shell crab and the I love sushi special roll wth regular and spicy tuna in a garlic ponzu sauce. Even though this place can be packed I always get seated and served quickly and efficiently. So far my favorite sushi place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Korean owned sushi bar.  They always treat me well and recognized me on my second visit.  I had something that tasted a little fishy (it wasn't a popular item) and let the manager know.  He apologized and removed the charge from the bill.  Great service!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time on Sunday 12 June 2016 and had a really good time. Carlos was my waiter and he was really great. He took care of me while I waited at the sushi bar for my friend to arrive. The food was awesome and the manager was really friendly. One of my favorite things about this place are the names for the sushi rolls and the selection! I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi place in Vegas! My wife and discovered this place about two months ago.  A week hasn't gone by without us going there.  Always crowded, but never had to wait more than 15 minutes to sit.  Staff is friendly and very good.  My wife's favorite cut roll is the Double D.  She can't get enough of the Chef's Special sauce.   I love the hand rolls.  They really pile the sushi in there.  They don't hold back and I love it.  The selection is unbelievable and the quality matches it.  Love the place and super happy we found our go to sushi place."}
{"text":"What can I say?! Best sushi, best service, awesome atmosphere! This place is alive. When it comes to sushi, I would only recommend this place. We've created so many memories in here.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"The best miso soup! Highly recommend! This little sushi gem served some of the best sushi I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Sushis are fresh. Place is big enough to accomodate a lot of people. Bento boxes are not ideal, specially the terriyakis. Sauce is too sweet, and meat are small portion. The eel sauce is not perfect and not thick enough. But overall, if you're a sushi lover. This place would be decent enough."}
{"text":"This place will take care of you whether you know what you want or whether you want to describe and have them make it. Very fresh and tasty. They greet you in the proper way as well. The food was awesome and the prices are completely reasonable.     Sitting at the sushi bar is the way to go."}
{"text":"5 stars isnt enough for this place...... literally the BEST sushi i have EVER had..... they have so many different types of rolls and well a great selection of hand rolls.  i eat here about twice a week (which is not enough, if u ask me!!!).  the fish is so fresh, the flavors are amazing, and the atmosphere is fun too!  The staff are all friendly.  As soon as you walk in, the entire staff greets you.    Some of my favorite rolls include the screaming orgasm, spring mountain roll, almost 90%, and the lisa hand roll.  Just writing this review makes me want to go have some now!!!!!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite sushi in Las Vegas. There are dozens of sushi places within ten minutes of where I live, and this will always be my first choice. Recommend!"}
{"text":"So I have had a back and forth journey with this restaurant, and this has what has kept me from reviewing it.  I finally feel ready.  The first thing to know about this place is that there is no all you can eat and the rolls often are averaging around 13 dollars each (the ones I ordered normally around 14).  This automatically puts an expectation that they should be higher quality than an average sushi joint.  When you come inside the waitresses are dressed in traditional Japanese clothing and the restaurant is very sizeable, with lots of tables and booths, and a huge sushi bar.  Often there are many sushi chefs working behind it.  Despite its massive size, even on a busy night the service was relatively quick, and they work like a well oiled machine.  Now to the food, the first time I ever came here was about 4 years ago after being told I had to by multiple people.  I ordered a roll that involved mango and some other fun flavors, yet it was so bland and flavorless.  I refused to go back after that, and believed this place was over hyped.  I had a go to spot kaizen down the road so I had no need for them, however kaizen began to go down hill to the point that I gave up in them and jumped ship as a loyal customer.    I was desperate and in need of sushi that was close by so I thought ok I will give I love sushi one more shot.  I ended up really enjoying my rolls! Totally different experience, I thought maybe I had just ordered wrong last time. I had got the 90 percent roll, bam bam roll and spring mountain roll I believe.  These were packed with flavor, and I continued to have a similar experience the times I would drive up to get my sushi fix, until about 6 months ago.  I went alone just wanting grab one roll, and it was one I had enjoyed in the past.  It had ponzu sauce on it and shrimp tempura and many other yummy things.  However they weren't yummy, it tasted so much saltier than normal and the tempura was not crispy, it tasted liken it had been sitting out and the pack on the roll was sloppy. I was sad, and my craving not fullfilled with goodness.    I hoped it was a fluke so I went this past Saturday since monta was closed for renovations, and I was starving for something Japanese. I was greeted by insanity! It was a football night, and I guess this place becomes a sports bar when that happens, it was so loud I couldn't hear my boyfriend talk.  Whatever just give me good food that is all I want, we ordered the niku udon for the first time.  They have the medium thickness udon, not as thin as I prefer, but not thick like slugs.  It was some of the better niku in the valley,with a really full bodied broth, and the reason this review is not two stars.  I also ordered the 90 percent roll, a roll I thought I could trust, and another roll that had various forms of yellow tail and a \"orange sauce\".  The yellow tail roll was fine, not amazing though for its price tag.  The bam bam roll was aweful. The dip was saltier than it used to be, and the soft shell crab had become oddly tough.   So sadly unless I really want some niku, I am over this place.  Good sushi in a desert is so elusive, I will continue my search."}
{"text":"This place was sold and has changed and am NEVER going back. It was by far the WORST service we've ever had.....and we are regulars who come from NW Las Vegas. We noticed the last time it was slower than normal, but we got our food. Today, we went with our 16 month as usual, and an hour later still no food. The place wasn't even busy! When we kept asking all they said was I'm sort it's coming. People who got there after us were either eating or already done. Then when I said we were leaving because my daughter needed to eat, they just started bring rolls out....not even her chicken teriyaki. Nothing was done or offered, aside an apology, so we said we were leaving. They didn't even try to stop us and make us pay. I'm in shock by this whole thing! I am so sad that the new owners are failing with what used to be one of, if not the best sushi places in town."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi restaurants I have been to anywhere. They have a wild collection of specialty rolls with some of the filthiest names on earth. The Spicy Ponzu is liquid heroin. drink the leftovers, you will never be the same! Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"I admit it I'm a sushi snob!  I do not enjoy just any old plain sushi roll.   First it must be fresh (this goes without saying),  and second I like a little creativity in my rolls.  Well this place delivers!  The menu is extensive and full of lots of unique choices.   Pretty much everything I have tried is delicious and awesome.  Having tried many sushi restaurants in town I Love Sushi is without a doubt my favorite. The place is always hopping and the service is pretty good.  Some of my recommended rolls to try are Shaun's Special and Ryan's Special."}
{"text":"These guys are just amazing. Best sushi in Las Vegas in my opinion. Ambiance is great as well. They sure could spice it up w some good music and better outfits however. Not sure about socks and flip flops however. Looks not so comfortable but hey food this good i take it any day. Spicy hot edamame  is a good start. Good new creations on new food designs."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi!!  The people who work there are efficient and very friendly. I was pleasantly surprised with the way the Last Call roll tasted, warm but cool, and is just incredible. My glass with green tea (cold) was never empty."}
{"text":"J'ai command√© des sushis √† cet endroit via Just Eat la semaine derni√®re et j'ai √©t√© grandement impressionn√© par la qualit√© de leurs sushis ainsi que leurs prix ridiculement bas pour un go√ªt aussi exceptionnel. Essayez I love Sushis, ils valent la peine!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Yumm! Everything was really good! A little pricey but great! We really enjoyed our dinner!"}
{"text":"I've dined here twice now and have been very happy with not only the sushi, but the service quality. The sushi selection is huge and has something for everyone. You can taste the quality and freshness in everything they offer. The waitresses are on top of their game, constantly refilling drinks and asking if you need anything else. There is never a time that they leave you waiting. Not only a great local sushi place, but a great sushi restaurant in general."}
{"text":"I've tried this place out once or twice more. Service was terrible, hardly friendly at all. The sushi is just not that good. I wish I loved this place but I can't stomach it. Extensive menu with crappy service and very mediocre food."}
{"text":"I'm a biiiiiig sushi lover and was really not so impressed. Sushi was pretty good I'd say, but not worth 16 bucks a roll.  All the sushi was overpriced and Overwhelmed by the sushi menu. I asked our waitress many questions and she couldn't answer half and the other half she was just look at me and walk away. Was impressed by the cucumber salad though!"}
{"text":"**********Edit 4/28/08  just came here again over the weekend and i had to bump it to 5 stars!  the service was great and our waitress was so attentive.  Though i though i had given up forever on sushi, i was wrong.  They have some pretty inventive rolls  like, \"who's your mama?\" \"who's your pimp?\" \"whats your ex-wife?\" funny names like that.  The chefs are all young, which doesnt mean anything, but i cant hep but wonder if they helped in the sushi naming. The bento box lunch specials are very reasonable, stating at $7.95.  comes with salad, miso, rice, a little pouch of something filled with sweet rice, sweet tofu (i think), and two pot stickers. anyways...probably the only sushi place ill return to when i come here again.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   good sushi, tempura and teriyaki.  i would be more elaborate, but for sushi night my mom wanted to go here and i didnt...so at no fault of their own, i was in no good mood.  I ordered tempura which was average.  My brother ordered teriyaki chicken, which he enjoyed very much.  My mom got sushi, and then we all split a spider roll, which i found to be very tasty.  minus a star because the service was so so...had to wait for some time for our drinks to be refilled, though it was a busy night and somewhat loud..."}
{"text":"With sushi roll names like \"Taste like My Ex\", \"Threesome\", and \"I Love Ass\", this place is everything that Vegas is but is in the lovely neighboring city of Henderson. Yelp pro-tip, if you want to converse with your sushi chef and want real good food recommendations, I highly advise that you always take a seat at the sushi bar as opposed to a table if you can. We started off an assortment of nigiri as I tend to shy away from rolls as much as possible. Sake, Amaebi, Toro, Unagi, Uni, Ebi, Salmon Belly, etc. were all equally amazing. The Toro was like butter and according to my girlfriend, who rates sushi places based on how good their Uni was, was the best Uni that she has had since moving to Nevada. Because of the aforementioned names of rolls and the fact that they had like 60+ rolls/items on the menu, I had to try one. I ended up getting the \"Kitchen Sink\" and man was that a good choice. Literally a kitchen sink in terms of fishes in the roll and it tasted so bomb. Finally my girlfriend and I shared the baked lobster roll (no rice), which was literally all lobster and mushrooms and was also pleasantly surprisingly good as I have never had a lobster roll without rice before. All and all, it was a great experience and I will definitely come here again. Because, we were seated at the bar, I can't say too much about the service because our chef literally just hands us the food after we order. Yelp don't lie...this place is fire."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I haven't tried much of the sushi here but I am a huge fan of their tuna poke. The tuna actually tastes marinated and not just doused in a soy sauce dressing. It's also got a bit of a spicy kick which I love!   I Love Sushi also has awesome spicy garlic edamame. Definitely can't go wrong with some deliciously seasoned edamame to share as a starter.  I usually come here for sake and beers, so I haven't explored their menu too much yet. My friends get the rolls and I've tried a piece here and there - not bad at all. I'll have to write a more detailed review when I really feast on their sushi.   Service is quick; the servers are Korean as they yell out orders in Korean to one another across the restaurant. The few times I've been here the servers have always been attentive. They just happen to check up on us when I need another sake or beer...  The menu items here are a little pricier but I don't mind for the taste and service. I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm craving their tuna poke and some sake!"}
{"text":"We've never been disappointed at I Love Sushi. One of the best in town for quality. Well worth the extra dollars. I'll never stop eating there. Our family favorites are Tuna Tataki, Agedashi Tofu, baked lobster and butter garlic special."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I've found in Henderson so far. The quality is good and service are good. The rolls are fantastic but there are so many rolls on the sushi menu that I can't keep track of the ones i have/haven't had or the ones I like. They may want to skinny down the sushi menu just a little to cut down on confusion but I do enjoy the adventure! Perhaps a few daily special rolls would be cool."}
{"text":"The BEST sushi spot in Vegas, without a doubt, and I have had aloooot of sushi just about everywhere in the 13 years I've lived here. The fish is always FRESH, the service is exceptional, the food is always flavorful and consistently satisfying, and I could go on and on because everything is just EXCELLENT!   I Highly recommend I Love Sushi to all of my friends, family, co-workers and even complete strangers. It's just that good.   Speaking of which, I'll probably head over there tomorrow. I'm due for a screaming orgasm, nabeyaki udon and a kiss of fire roll. Yum!"}
{"text":"So good.  So good.  Lots of vegetarian options, including a plain noodle udon with a vegetable broth, which I don't often find at sushi places.  I highly recommend both the inari and the tamago. A hidden gem far, far off the Strip."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi that is well priced and sure to please! Best spicy tuna handroll I have ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi I've had in a long time.  Started with an O face -can't explain what it is but it's delicious.  The head some amazing Hamachi Belly.  Then had a flower blossom roll (which just blew my mind)  I'm from San Francisco and we have great sushi -but this place is in the top 5 for me.    If you want off the strip for a little bit come here!!!"}
{"text":"We had ordered a udon and the chicken was so dry we couldn't eat it. The sushi was ok, but not great. The owner was raising his voice to the nice woman that helped us when we asked for some sort of discount for the chicken udon, since we didn't and couldn't eat it. In the past they have been ok, but pushy to get us out. We were very disappointed. This will be our last time we eat here."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I have been going to I Love Sushi for 4 years now, ever since moving to the area. The service is always top notch and the sushi has always been fresh and amazing! Our favorites are the I Love My Ass, Burning Your Stomach, and Kiss of Fire! The Dynamite bakes dish is amazing as well if you feel like something hot.  On occasions when we've ordered out the food has always been packed well and complete! I would definitely recommend I Love Sushi to anyone!"}
{"text":"I love... I Love Sushi!  We have been enjoying our neighborhood sushi bar for many years.  It is always packed - which is a tell-tale sign of how good the food is.  My favorites made special for me... Spicy Yellowtail with brown rice, a big dot of Sriracha and fresh jalapenos on each piece -yummm =)) I also love the Screaming Orgasm- no rice.  My kids have been eating yellowtail since they could eat solid food- thanks to I love sushi. I would highly recommend this sushi bar. Plus the owners and sushi chefs are really cool."}
{"text":"I never even really cared that much for sushi until my partner made me come here one night. The rest is history. This place is great. They typically get people in and out of there fairly quickly, so there is hardly any wait time. The house sake is awesome; it has a great kick to it. They have over 150 special sushi selections."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Las Vegas. The food is excellent and they are super fast in case you are ever in a rush.   Garlic Edamame to start is a must.  I personally love the Johnny Roll with no rice, the Candy Roll, and Hawaiian roll. The tuna nigiri is always fresh."}
{"text":"Being from LA where they have a lot of good sushi joints it tool a while for me to find something good in Vegas but here it is at last. I have been going to I Love Sushi for about a year now and never have i had a bad experience. Its always busy so you know the food is always fresh. My favorite roll is I Love My Ass and Spring Mt Roll. Another good item is the Screaming Orgasms and i usually ask them not to sear the tuna I think its a lot better that way."}
{"text":"I just went today for my daughters birthday and we had a sushi boat for 2 soooo much food sooo delicious!! Great service!! Definitely well priced !! A must for anyone who loves sushi!!"}
{"text":"When a friend told me the name of the restaurant, I was a bit apprehensive...but the place was packed and we were seated quickly. Wow...the names of the rolls are fun and sex-themed. We shared some sashimi and a couple rolls and everything was great! I can't wait to go back! We had the Sex on The Beach roll, Lobster Roll, Tuna, Yellowtail and Albacore sashimi....everything was great!"}
{"text":"Forget all the expensive sushi spots in town and go to I Love Sushi. Best sushi I have ever had in Vegas or anywhere else. The rolls are awesome and really unique...especially I Love My Ass, Dragon, Bam Bam...and the Screaming Orgasm rocks as well. They get very busy at the expected times but I've never had bad service here and I've eaten here at dozens of times. When I take people here from out of town the first thing they ask when they come back to visit is when we can go to I Love Sushi. Enough said."}
{"text":"By far one of the best sushi restaurants that I've been to. I don't care that the rolls are ultra-Americanized with crispy this and fried that. What it boils down to is Grade A raw fish and this place delivers! This place is consistent and since it opened has been serving some of the best sushi and sashimi in town. Added bonus that it's right down the street from my house.    The place went through some beautiful renovations in the last two years and is now even bigger. Bolder and more attractive colors. Some of my favorites: Flower roll, Ryan's roll, Spicy Yellowtail Sashimi with spicy ponzu sauce, Yellowtail comma, and the lunch bento box specials are solid as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely love that even when they are busy, I can still get a table and the sushi is always amazing.  I especially love their spicy tuna roll."}
{"text":"I usually don't venture down eastern because I live more west of Las Vegas, but I had some family staying at Homewood Suites down the road so we were searching for somewhere close to grab some dinner. They didn't know what they wanted and were just skimming through Yelp when we saw the reviews for this place. We got there just as they were opening and were greeted nicely and seated right away. The menu seemed like it had a lot of options and even for my aunt, who isn't a fan of seafood, she was able to find something for herself. We all seemed to try something we usually don't get just to see how we liked it and we were very pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything was. The staff was also very friendly and we loved how the ladies wore geisha outfits. We soon noticed that the place filled up quick so it must be a hit with others too! Thanks for the great service and even better food!"}
{"text":"Our friends Nicole B. and Steven S. begged us to try I Love Sushi, so after 6 years of avoiding it, I finally went.  Eric R. didn't think it would be a good deal since it is a la carte, and I heard it was all about pornographic-named rolls, so I wasn't expecting much.  Our friends made reservations, which we thought was weird for a local a la carte sushi joint, but lo and behold, there was a crazy wait at 7 and we skipped all of that.  The servers wore kimonos, and this place is really big for a sushi restaurant - less activity at the bar and more at tables around it.  Our server was very friendly and efficient, and we had a private-esque booth.  I got iced green tea.  Steven S. does NOT love sushi, so he ordered a dinner bento with chicken and beef.  He got brown rice for a $1 charge.  Nicole B. got udon and the cherry blossom, a non-rice \"roll\" which is really a massive amount of soft shell crab chopped up and wrapped in avocado slices.  Eric R. got the rainbow roll, ikura sushi, and had a few pieces of my nigiri order.  I went for it, and appreciated some interesting selections here.  I got hamachi, sake, saba, amaebi, uni, salmon skin temaki, and a quail egg shooter.  When I got the first pieces, salmon and yellowtail, I immediately noticed the same problem Goyemon has - HOT rice, COLD fish.  YUCK!!!!  The sushi rice was hot and not really sushi rice, which is upsetting because 1) sushi is about the rice and 2) the mixed temperatures make everything taste weird.  Not okay.  The fish quality was fine enough, though the yellowtail was splitting apart at each seam so to speak.  I liked the salmon better.  The mackerel was cured just fine and covered with my fave vegetable, green onions.  The uni was okay.  The salmon skin handroll was stuffed, and it was prepared with gobo, kaiware, cucumber, and avocado without sauce, which was very good.  The quail egg shooter had 3 quail egg yolks, masago, green onion, and ponzu which was different and tasty.  I got the amaebi last.  The sushi was good and the fried heads were enormous and covered in tempura batter.  They were on top of shredded daikon and served with ponzu.  I was very full after all of this, and I am glad I tried it finally.  However, there is no excuse for poor rice when sushi is about rice, so I do not see myself returning."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi place here in Vegas. I've tried so many places out here and the quality is second to none. Service is great! My new regular spot. I can't believe someone gave it a one star because it's not all you can eat  you don't get this kind of quality at all you can eat."}
{"text":"This is my sister's favorite sushi place and I've been here a handful of times while visiting her. I wouldn't say they have the highest quality fish but their rolls are very tasty. And they have a large variety of them. All your favorites are on the menu plus quite a few that I think they made up. If you like trying maki with crazy combos then this place is for you. If you are more of a nigiri / sashimi sushi eater then I would probably go elsewhere.  PS they have a full bar and also make some pretty decent cocktails!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, wide variety of rolls, fast service, fresh fish, little rice and cold mugs for your beer!!!"}
{"text":"The three stars are for the food. Quality great but priced high.   As for the experience it's crazy in there the manager or owner I believe does not let staff do their job he is all up their butts and loud about it. It's like a father yelling at his children.  The staff is great there I'm sure the make great tips but they appear scared and uptight on busy nights so don't expect them to interact with u.  Good expensive sushi but not a calm fun place.. Very loud. It may just be me but the owner is nice to customers but stands up in front and is over bearing I want to leave before I even get to enjoy his food.. I have given the place multiple visits and yeah it's never different. Not my cup of tea! Maybe lunch is different but I want be finding out!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Vegas. Love the oyster shooter."}
{"text":"What the ----! This place is CRAZY good. Seriously. I've had a lot of sushi around america, I live in New York City.. this place rocked my world. Not only was everything 5-star good, but they did it while closing for a party of 20. I was expecting some seriously bad sushi and they basically melted my face off. 5 star service, 5 star food."}
{"text":"Really reasonably priced and the fish is fresh. I have not been to another sushi restaurant on the strip, in Henderson or Las Vegas that tops I Love Sushi!   Try ... Rock and Roll and have them add mango. I also opt for no mayo in sauce. Yellowtail and Jalape√±o. Sean Special with soy paper, brown rice and no cream cheese.  ALWAYS a crowd pleaser! Everyone I take loves this place.  Frankie and Edwin are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place for sushi.  Visited 3 times and loved it every time.  No shortage of options, everyone will find something they like.  Best experience is at the bar where you can banter with the chefs.  Meat-less, rice-less, fried, raw, saucy, plain, all kinds of options and everything is good. Kiss of Fire, Bam Bam, Sushi Nachos, Screaming Orgasm, Who's Your Momma, and more and more."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh.  Portion was acceptable.   Nice ambience.  I am extremely pleased with the service.  The server(s) kept checking back on us multiple times.  When I visit my friend in Las Vegas again, I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Every year in August when I'm in LV for a weekend convention-like outing about 50 of us go there late afternoon and spend a couple of hours sharing their amazing rolls.  How they manage to handle such a large rowdy bunch, I have no idea, but we love it.    The rolls are unusual and very yummy, the sushi and sashimi is also good but it's the rolls that make this place unique."}
{"text":"Always a great place for sushi.  They don't have AYCE.  The lettuce wrap sushi is my favorite.  The bento is reasonable and a good amount.  The service is always good and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Service is awful!  their sushi is wonderful but they're overwhelmed with work and not enough staff"}
{"text":"The reviews for this place have to be fake. The place is dirty, service was slow and very polite or attentive almost as if you owe them something for going there. Additionally the rolls are sloppy, too much rice and sauces. There are much better places in Vegas to go then this place!"}
{"text":"Sushi is decent here, not the best in the city, but tasty nonetheless. Takes a bit long for take out even on slow days at lunch, but you get quite a bit of food for the dollar. I ordered the tempura special and it was a bit greasy, but despite the mounds of food I always get through the meal and walk away feeling better with it in my tummy, so if you're ever along the way, not a bad place to stop for a bite."}
{"text":"Best damn sushi in Henderson, if not Vegas.   I could eat the garlic tuna sushi by the bucket load. I guess I would if I were a seal. But I'm not. So I eat it here. One delicious, melt-in-your mouth, piece at a time."}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good. I'm quite surprised by the over the top reactions to this place. The service was just fine. The miso soup was good, and the salad was also quite yummy. I got the Yellowtail roll. The rolls were very big, and were delicious. The presentation was also very nice. I went in expecting poor quality sushi, but was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood/chain place to find good sushi. Prepare to be amused!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! By far my favorite sushi place in henderson/las Vegas! The owner James is awesome and very personable! Great environment and service! The screaming orgasm is AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was impeccable. There  are a lot of options for sushi rolls but most of them are pretty similar. The sushi itself was a bit overdone for me (as in too complicated which I think masks the quality, or lack thereof, of the fish). Mochi was yummy!  Overall sushi was just ok, better if you like a ton of stuff piled on and tempura shrimp in them."}
{"text":"I Love Sushi is the name, and reflects our feelings about this great restaurant. Its a 2-3 times per month habit.   Excellent management and exceptional service, always."}
{"text":"Really love this place. Definitely on the pricey side but the flavors are really great. New owner is very nice.  Favorite dishes are definitely he screaming orgasm and the kiss of fire roll. Unfortunately they don't offer all you can eat:("}
{"text":"I Love Sushi is one of those local spots that are as good as it gets. It is not the flashiest or most expensive and it doesn't have a famous chef. It's just quality, consistent, and delicious. I didn't think I was going to give a 5 to anywhere for a while but when I started to try and pick it apart I couldn't really say anything bad about it. They are fast with their service, but not too fast. The dishes are always delivered exactly the same. The food quality is always very high. The fish is very fish. Prices are reasonable.  If there was a 4.5 stars I would have considered that one just because of the decorations. It is nice, but based on the volume and quality of the place, it could use a little facelift to reflect the true quality of who it is. It's not bad, its clean, its just a little old and tired looking. But that would not distract from going.  If I want American style sushi, this is the spot. If I want more authentic Japanese sushi I always go to Miko's Izakaya. Two totally different styles. Both best in class."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Sushi place in Vegas. Grand Canyon roll is a sure bet every time. Screaming Orgasm is a must have too."}
{"text":"I want to say I've been here three times between the end of last year up to this past May. The good part is that every trip was great! I was really, really skeptical when my co-workers informed me of a \"good\" sushi joint in Anthem, so it took them a while to convince me to take a trip here. I'm definitely glad they did.   What's different from other sushi restaurants is probably the most important. I like that they have several, really delicious, no-rice sushi options. Very cool for those that want to watch their carb intake (diabetics!). Also, this is a non-AYCE sushi joint. Not everyone's cup of tea, but I think that attributes to the freshness and quality of fish.  My favorite no-rice dishes are the Spring Mountain Roll (spicy soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, avocado, radish sprout, eel, wrapped in rice paper, topped with spicy mayo and sriracha) and the Screaming Orgasm (tuna sashimi or seared, lots of julienned daikon, sauces galore, tobbiko, green onions). The Spring Mountain Roll is probably my overall favorite sushi roll. The last time I was there, the chefs gave us a bowl of tempura jalape√±o. Not something I would ever order, but they were so good! And not terribly spicy either.   My only gripe was the terrible quality of the Ikura on my last visit. It was not good. But, to their defense, I hardly find really delicious Ikura or Uni in the valley. Other than that, it's just really busy during dinner. Service is usually pretty good, no complaints, but nothing amazing.  Overall, great place for a sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Service was great... I ordered a few rolls but my favorite was \"screaming orgasm\" lol names are a lil kinky but hey it's VEGAS... not a place for the prudes ;-) it's a little pricy for a little bit of food, that's why I gave it 4 stars. I'll be back for my *Screaming Orgasm* for sure."}
{"text":"I have been eating at I love sushi for years.  They have really fresh fish that makes the seafood experience overall... non threatening.  Pretty much everyone I've ever taken loves it.  It can get expensive if you're hungry (or in my case, typically thirsty!) but it is a great place to do sushi at.  And, their sushi menu is actually descriptive.  The sushi chefs are a blast and almost every time I go, the owner is diligently making sure the customers are getting stellar service.   Their cucumber salad in usually excellent and they have a full restaurant menu for your non sushi savvy pals.  My favorites are the baked green mussel, kiss of fire, and the sundevil."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Talk about a HUGE sushi menu.  You can go multiple times without trying everything at this place.  I have only lived in Vegas now for a little over 2 months, but thus far I have yet to find another Sushi joint that I like better.  The only place this place is getting 4 stars and not 5 is because I think it is a bit pricy for what you get.  The service was also mediocre both times I have been here.  Besides that I don't think you can go wrong here.  Tip: The Poke Salad is amazing!  The screaming orgasm is also, well....orgasmic."}
{"text":"I love sushi and I love this place! Service is good most of the time, when it gets busy sometimes it's hard to get their attention, but that doesn't stop me from eating here as often as possible. I have never had a bad meal here, always on point. I've been going to this place for years, f*cking love this place...can you swear on yelp?.."}
{"text":"For some reason this place gets good reviews but every time I have gone to this location my Tuna was always \"mushy\", not firm, sweet nor fresh tasting in the least. Coming from the Bay Area where you can find \"fresh\", I can tell right away that the Tuna here isn't the freshest from the mushy consistency.   I will never go back and have found other Sushi Restaurants on Eastern that blows this place out of the water."}
{"text":"Hands down best locals sushi n in town.  I have been coming here for years... screaming orgasm is worth the drive from Summerlin!"}
{"text":"I Love Sushi is really convenient! There is always seating and the food is good. Now, its not top quality by any means, BUT! I have never had a bad experience here, I even ordered their party platters for my 25th birthday.   The most recent visit to I Love Sushi was as per usual, very satisfying, I had the all you can eat menu, and ordered spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy avocado, chicken teriyaki, and white tuna sushi. The rolls have enough meat on them that I dont feel like I am filling up on rice. The seaweed is not over powering, and the rice is moist, and has never been dry,   The Chicken Teryaki is very salty, be warned!   The servers are very nice, although their English isnt great, so sometimes you have to repeat things. All in all, I will go back, and recommend it to my friends,"}
{"text":"I have been going to this sushi place since I was in middle school.  Being young I was never into raw fish, until I ate here.  I fell in love with sushi here and this place will forever be one of my favorite sushi place to go to regularly.    I Love Sushi does not offer All you can eat because of the quality of their fish.  The Cherry Blossom and the Screaming Orgasm are my favorite rolls to get there.  The sashimi and nigiri is undoubtedly one of the freshest you can find in Vegas.  You will not be disappointed in coming here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite place to eat. Friendly employees, great service and food always so good."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas and that includes the strip and all the fancy places and this place is in a random strip mall in Henderson. We eat here almost weekly and always get the same 4 or 5 rolls and then one new one. Have had almost everything on the menu and the fish is always fresh and everything is great. Favorites include Screaming O, I Love My Ass and Bam Bam. Always busy so be prepared to wait on Friday, Saturday and Sunday but it always moves fast or you can sit at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"I Love Sushi is our go to restaurant for sushi. I have never had anything from there that wasn't great. The monkey roll is unique and very tasty. The service is good and no matter how busy they are, we always get right in. But most of the time, they are pretty busy. If you want to best sushi in Henderson, check this place out."}
{"text":"Soo yeah I think I'm in LOVE! Ummm yah hands down best sushi spot I've tried. And I will never go anywhere else!!! The rolls were so flavorful, there wasn't a lot of rice packed in them and there of plenty of fish. The poki salad was great! Our waitress was nice and friendly, I think her same was Lisa :-) I wish I could have tried other stuff on the menu but I was stuffed. Oh yesss for dessert get the mochi combo :-) anyway I will be back soon! LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"Did not live up to my expectations! Jackpot roll was highly recommended and supposedly their best roll, but it tasted like a basic roll. If u want real sushi, head down to SD:)"}
{"text":"good place good portion sizes and good price. I reccomend takeout, and the dynamite roll!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of I love Sushi because of all the mixed reviews online but took a chance and went there.  The AYCE menu had a fair number of options. The lunch AYCE was $15.99 for Friday. The sushi was fresh and very flavourful. The service was also great. Even though we reached around 2:15pm and lunch hours end at 3pm, we were able to order two rounds. They even came and told us when the last round for ordering was, in case we lost track while enjoying the food. The calamari rings were also really fresh.  All in all, it was a great AYCE experience. We have finally found a reasonably priced AYCE delicious sushi place not too far from home after many months of searching!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Fast service and always friendly.  High quality sushi with a lot if variety.  I got the love boat for 2people and it was a lot of good! Perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"Great sushi spots with a huge variety of rolls, with clever names to boot. Fast, friendly service, reasonable prices, worth a visit! 90% wood roll, mistake roll, pink sex on the beach roll (had mussels, lol),and rock and roll were our delicious choices, all REALLY yummy. If you are looking for great sushi, this spot will get the job done! Highly recommend it! Large dinning area, no outdoor seating, plenty of parking in lot. Nice drink menu too."}
{"text":"Wow... I cannot even begin to describe how fresh and amazing this sushi is here at I Love Sushi! I've tried so many sushi restaurants here in vegas and this one has changed my view about sushi... The only negative thing I have to say is that it is expensive, cheapest roll was $9 and they don't have all you can eat... But since the service and sushi were outstanding, the bill doesn't even matter!  I'll definitely be back !"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here - it's always rockin busy so you know the fish has to be fresh!. The sushi bar is huge and the booths are big and private. All the waitresses are friendly and very attentive. They wear stylish colorful Kimonos! It is absolutely family friendly - this is by far my favorite sushi place in all of Vegas / Henderson! People travel from all over town to eat here! They have very sexy & fun names for their sushi rolls! Coldest beers in town - large sapporro - fav!! My favorite rolls you have to order:  #1 Screaming Orgasm - Tuna with radishes that are cut like angel hair - good for low carb orders! #2 Kiss of Fire ( It's a little Spicy- if you prefer not spicy - just say no sauce- the little sliver of jalapeno on top is fresh so not very spicy) #3 Johnny Roll No Rice - Refreshing! #4 Sushi Nachos - Unlike anything you have ever had! Pure deliciousness! #5 Anthem roll - traditional Calif roll with spicy tuna on top. #6 Ryan's Special or Double D #7 Caterpillar Roll  This place is busy from open to close! Call ahead to get a reservation!"}
{"text":"Service was FAST and polite! . We were in the mood for some late night sushi. Got here at 10:15, aye two rolls by 10:28. That's fast. So yummy."}
{"text":"I come here very rarely because the lunch specials are notably cheaper. But this visit will be my LAST. Every experience I've had I've dealt with really bad costumer service from all employees.   Today we had sat down to eat and the women working barely acknowledged us, forgot half of the things to bring out. Yelled over our heads as another costumers came in. Then at the end of our meal she decided to tell us that the interact machine was not currently working and had my sister run out to the nearest atm.  Very unprofessional. The food is OK not the best of cheaper sushis I've had. Not somewhere I recommended to anyone and definitely will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"The most notable aspect of this restaurant is its extensive (almost overwhelmingly long) menu and it's a cheap prices. The service was decent (not super fast but not slow either), and the food was average as far as sushi goes. I ordered the general Tao chicken and it was fairly good and not too oily (good portion size) and my partner ordered the vegitarian set. She also said it was ok. I think for the both of us it came to less than 25 bucks including tax and tip which is great. See pictures."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi spot in Vegas! The owner is awesome, the staff in so kind and efficient. I make it a point to swing by, even if it's just for a quick roll, when I'm on this side of town.  I've devoured almost everything on the menu and have yet to come across something that's not delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was super busy and yet we got seated right away. I'm not going to lie I'm not a sushi person, but all of my family is so ya... They loved loved loved their sushi everyone that got a roll was so happy.  I got the Chicken Yakisoba it was soooooo good! I was very happy with my dish.   Our waitress was so cute, nice and very attentive. I loved the atmosphere of this place. The family absolutely found their favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"It's a party in your mouth.   I LOVELOVELOVELOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!! This is the best sushi I've ever had in my life. Everything about I Love Sushi is amazing, the sushi, miso soup, the restaurant, the menu, the sexual/hilarious names they think up for the sushi rolls (Tastes Like My Ex-Girlfriend, Screaming Orgasm, I Love My Ass, etc..), the waitresses, the chefs, the bar, the booths, the tables, the service, the prices, everything! I dream about their sushi and plum saki everyday. The softness of the rice, the way they pack in the many versatile ingredients that go into each roll, how at first bite you just sit back and realize that you've been missing out on a big chunk of life in food world. Mmm.. I can still taste it in my mouth.  The restaurant is lit just right to be romantic and bright enough to see what you're eating, who you're talking to, and occasionally check out the hot chef with the Japanese flag as a bandana behind the sushi bar (i love you, super sexy chef). The service is phenomenal, everyone working there is Japanese, even the waitresses, and I had to keep from laughing when our graceful, polite waitress who looks like she's never said a cuss word in her life repeated our order to us, \"2 Screaming Orgasms, One roll of Tastes Like My Ex Girlfriend, one Ricky Roll and one roll of I Love My Ass with plum saki\". It still makes me laugh just thinking about it.  I once drove from L.A. to Henderson, Nevada just to eat here. My absolute favorite roll is the Ricky Roll. I give this restaurant a bajillion stars, this place will definitely get you some, and I'm gonna dream about their sashimi tonight."}
{"text":"Love their sushi! They have such a large selection so you can always try new rolls each time you visit. They do not have all you can eat but I think that's because of the high quality of all of their rolls. I love any of their spicy rolls, they taste so good! The service is also up to par. You never wait long for anything you have ordered and bring your check promptly at the end of the meal. This is one of my go to sushi places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi spot in town. Great services, great food, great atmosphere. Everyone I take to ILS falls in love with the place, as I did when I walked in for the first time last year. I'll drive as far as I need to have sushi @ILS"}
{"text":"Never fails! This is my FAVORITE sushi place in all Las Vegas, and I have been to MANY! The chefs are all very friendly and very fast!  My all time favorite rolls are Bonzai, Double D, Joe Special, Jackpot Special, and Kiss of Fire! I wish my stomach was big enough to have these all EVERY TIME! I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of I Love Sushi, but I haven't been here in a while.  In the meantime, I've eaten sushi all over Vegas and discovered that I Love Sushi isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  The sushi is good.  I love their oyster shooters, but their 2000 different rolls all taste the same to me.  They rely WAY too much on sauce and often I want to yell at them that simple is good too!  A nice elegant simple roll can go a long way.  The service is always great.  Sometimes I wonder if the servers are really Japanese or they just fake a thick and heavy Japanese accent to go with their beautiful Japanese costumes and restaurant decor.  The one thing I really like about I Love Sushi is the ambiance.  It is always loud and rowdy in there, unlike many sushi restaurants.  You feel like you're somewhere \"happenin\", which I love when I'm eating out.  As far as the food goes, like I said, it's just ok.  If  you are the type of person who only eats sushi and sashimi, the place is great!  But if, like me, you like a roll or two, I'd check out other spots."}
{"text":"Yikes?  What happened to authentic Japanese Sushi?  If you like the litany of sexy body parts and earthly dragon named sushi that are extreme variations of traditional sushi, then this is the place for you.  I prefer more traditional and authentic sushi and so it is hard really to taste the flavors of the sushi in a restaurant like this because the sauces and fried stuff and mixture is kinda overpowering.  But hey, I like to have ketchup on my steak once in a while, and so, I have come here several times and will come again as it ain't bad, but it really isn't real Japanese food, it is blended to the American taste....."}
{"text":"I've always heard of this place but never tried it. We came in during dinner time and they were packed. We were seated at the bar. Our sushi chef was friendly and nice.  We typically like to eat sashimi/nigiri. The selection of special fish are limited. Our go to is uni and it was nice and fresh here. We ordered the toro (fatty tuna) and it melted in your mouth. Other than that, everything else here was standard. The fish is fresh here because they stay busy. We also tried the oyster shooter and the uni shooter. I really didn't like it because it was salty, maybe it was the ponzu sauce? We had one roll, I think it was the Joe's roll? It was good.  I don't think this will be my go to place but I would come back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Our family loves this place. We have some non sushi eaters so it's great that this place offers so much more then just sushi and it's all been very good. My kids love the bento box dinners!"}
{"text":"I got a dancing eel roll and a Mexican roll. The first one was pretty good, but the second one wasn't what I thought it would be - it was basically a California roll with spicy crab meat instead of normal crab meat. I thought it would be real crab meat, but I guess I was wrong. The dancing eel roll had very crispy tempura inside, and the top had some poke-like tuna mix, avocado, and eel. Not bad! I waited for about 10-15 minutes for my food; this place gets busy! Rolls are pretty small for the very high prices; not sure whether it's worth it. After two rolls and down about $25, I could definitely still eat more!"}
{"text":"Eat here regularly because of the quality and service. Even on crowded Friday nights you get seated ina reasonable time. High quality sushi and the 'boats' are an amazing value, you will never leave hungry or wanting more."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's the best sushi I've had since we moved in Vegas almost 8 years ago, but it's up there certainly.  This is a large restaurant with several ways to dine.  You can sit at the sushi bar, there are numerous tables throughout the restaurant, and there are booths that offer a more private experience.  Service was decent, but we had to wait a long time for our check.  This was annoying as it was lunch time on a weekday, we clearly weren't looking for a 2 hour lunch.  The rolls and sashimi were good.  The famous screaming orgasm wasn't as good as I was expecting, given its reputation.  The yellowtail and salmon sashimi were excellent.  Buttery pieces of fish that had excellent flavor.  Good quality and prepared properly.  Decent beer selection.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A local place with one of the best rolls I have had...the \"burning your stomach roll\" It's extremely spicy, but one of the best I have tasted. And the sushi is always fresh. Service has always been great...the only minor complaint would be sometimes the sushi doesn't come out all together..that could be annoying if you are in a larger group and some people don't have their food. But other than that a great place and prices are great as well.   The menu is huge, so it could take you a while too decide."}
{"text":"Great lunch with my mom. Excellent service, excellent food, decent prices. Recommended!"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately on a busy evening, nice environment, incredible sushi, and great service. The servers dress as geishas, the only thing that bummed me out was that it was not all you can eat, however, they compensated by having a tremendous menu. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's the very first time I tried uni shooter. Oh, it's so yummy. And my friend tried scallop shooter which was so good as well. I was disappointed that they don't have kobe beef. And their chef didn't have any communication with customers even we sat at the sushi bar. But that's fine. We did enjoy the sushi here."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the best sushi places in all of Las Vegas! The waitresses are all really nice and are able to help with almost anything. The owner is a nice guy and gets to know his clients very well. Only thing about him is that we always get the vibe that he tries to rush everyone out.  Anyways! Onto the sushi. It's amazing and great quality. Some must try items: Lisa Handroll (my all time favorite!!!), something wrong #15, and Tuna Karai. They are all amazing. So amazing that I just stuffed my face and forgot to take pictures until everything was gone except part of the something wrong haha.  Pricing is reasonable, but can get pricey depending on what you get. Go check them out. P.s. there's no all you can eat, if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"IMHO This is the best sushi in town. Fresh. Creative. Worth the wait. My fav is the Joes Special. The Service is sometimes rushed. But to be expected when every table is turning every hour all dinner time long. I'm not a fan of the cramped waiting area. We learned to get there early. Before 6. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came to this place on a friends recommendation.  The restaurant is nice. The decor was a bit dark but the waitresses all wore kimonos which were really pretty.  They are friendly and nice.   Between three people, we ordered the large screaming orgasm, Gyoza, Rick and roll and the fire(?) roll.  The Gyoza was fried and came with ponzu dipping sauce. The outside was crunchy but the inside a little mushy. I have had better but it's not bad. The rock and roll was by far our favorite. Salmon yellowtail tuna and crab meat wrapped in cucumber. It also came with a sauce but I just ate it plain with a slice of lemon. Very fresh and hits the spot. The fire roll not only looked like Mexican food, but tasted like it too. Too saucy and tart, couldn't really taste the fish. The screaming orgasm was drowning in sauce but it was quite tasty. 10 pieces of seared tuna for 16 bucks. We were so overwhelmed by sauce that we decided to order one more roll, the eel one with the spicy tuna. I really liked that roll. I got the fresh fish taste from the spicy tuna and the sweetness from the eel.   Overall I would come back again but I have had better for the price. Over all everything was 70 bucks all together."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get sushi in town. I have been going here for years and love that there is no \"all you can eat\" option - just a diverse menu full of high-quality fish. The chefs are trained well and present the dishes in a nice fashion. I love that they give you free edamame and cucumber salad when you sit at the bar. My favorite rolls are the Tempura Roll and Japanese Lasagna. I ordered the Boom Boom Nipple Special last night and it was pretty good, however I was not really into the fish mix tempura that went along with that. Other than that, I always have a superb experience dining here. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome sushi! Best in Las Vegas!   Wait staff not 100% great in customer service...sometimes language barrier.  Little pricey...no AYCE, but they know ppl will pay extra for their rolls cause they are that good!"}
{"text":"This place looked more Chinese with the red color of choice lol.  The servers wear wrap around simplified shiny kimono and greet you the usual Irashaimase.  Their menu. They have a ton of rolls . Tons. It overwhelming and confusing since the the ingredients are all the same .  They should lessen the variety and stick to pictures menu so one can see how it looks like.  Their nigiri sushi are simple for a 4 dollar plus a plate.  But I can say their tuna that night was amazing . It just melted ."}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Management. Great price. Owner James was very accomodating and nice. He came over to introduce himself and provides many complimentary items. Thanks! Better than any buffet Sushi."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest sushi eater in Las Vegas, but when I go, I do love, \"I Love Sushi!\"  Totally fun place with lots of energy.  The food is very fresh, and sushi chefs are entertaining!  Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Why I haven't written a review yet here is beyond me. Maybe it's because of the great conversation I have here that I forget, or the full happy belly that leaves me in such a euphoric state that I can't bear to type. Well whatever the case I am writing it now. This place has such a great atmosphere and amazing sushi rolls everything, every time I come I can't believe it. I'm never ever ever disappointed l. The staff is friendly and the sushi is delightful what more can you want!? Get here early on the weekends because it's usually slammed packed. Def a local spot. Oh and by the way SIMON IS AWESOME! Such a kind spirit and a pleasure to be around. Always makes my time at I Love Sushi even better!"}
{"text":"This place was not as delicious as I remember it being. This time my friend and I sat away from the sushi bar, so it was not as entertaining--with the flying fish fillets and sake shots--as last time. We also sat by the door, which made the dining environment chillier than I'd like. Overall the food was good. I had the noodle soup and my friend ordered some elaborate sushi roll and dinner meal. Service was speedy and attentive."}
{"text":"I used to do the AYCE sushi, but since my first time at I Love Sushi, it's hard to go back. This place is my #1 sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. It is always busy, but it's because the food and service here is out of this world. Great and fresh quality of fish and the sushi chefs are friendly. Tip: ask the sushi chefs to create a roll of their own, you'll find that there are some great rolls not on the menu."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to eat here. It's across town, so you know how it is for us old folks to get around. I liked a lot of things about this place: The service was good, I was seated right away, and there was a large selection of sushi rolls. The only thing that I wasn't crazy about, was that there was no all-you-can-eat deals. If I wanted to fill my belly at this place, it probably would have cost me in excess of $100. Now, this is partly my fault, because I eat every meal as if I'm going to the chair, but there are lots of other sushi places which offer AYCE, and the quality is on par with this place. If this place offered AYCE, it would get 5 stars, hands down."}
{"text":"The food was great. When I go to a new sushi place I always order a spicy tuna roll to get a feeling for the quality of tuna that's being used and Friday nights are usually the best time to do that as many places get their last shipment of fish for the weekend on Friday ( local places in Nevada ) it's was fresh, delicious and well seasoned. The service was over the top even though the place was packed to the gills. We had I LOVE MY ASS ROLL as well which was awesome ! Will be back ASAP. Locals make the drive and try this place."}
{"text":"The name says it all!! I DO love sushi!  Great staff and I love to seeing the owner there! Favorite roll?? Well, there are many to choose from with cute names!! But my fav? The MC roll..."}
{"text":"If you know the difference between a mexican cooking Italian food or an italian cooking mexican then you'll appreciate that Koreans really can't make authentic Japanese. To non-Japanese you may think this is good sushi but everything from the seaweed salad, green tea, and sushi are far from true, real Japanese in taste and texture. Basically to a Japanese person raised in Japan. This food is terrible. Like comparing Taco Bell to a real Taqueria. Don't be fooled find the real thing."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while. When it was sushi date night with my boyfriend, I suggested this place other than my normal place. The sushi we ordered was so good! I loved each roll we tried. I loved the atmosphere and the service was awesome. I am definitely coming back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"An inexpensive gem in an otherwise expensive mine.   The menu is beyond intimidating, as their are nearly 100 plus rolls for you to choose from. I sat staring bleakly and relegated my dinner order to throwing darts, hoping that in the end my buyer's remorse wouldn't kick in. The plain spicy tuna was \"so-so\"; the Washington role was packed full of fresh, melt-in-your-mouth salmon and the Sun Devil role nearly made me change my underwear. Personally, one of the most delicious rolls I've had anywhere.  Service is very quick and non obtrusive. Seating was immediate on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was clean. The most obvious thing I noticed was the sheer volume of sushi chefs (nearly 10) pumping out quick, quality plates at a moment's notice. Overall, a pretty outstanding place. Price was decent (about $40 for 3 rolls) and there were no specials."}
{"text":"Their sushi choice is mediocre at best. The last time I was here, I was flipping through the menu several times because I was having difficulty with choosing anything that seemed remotely appetizing. I did choose the Threesome Special roll, though, which was actually pretty good. However, their sushi is too pricey considering the quality of food that they have. I wouldn't mind paying $13 for a roll that's not a special at a high-end sushi restaurant, but not at I Love Sushi. I will only come to I Love Sushi if friends want to meet up with me there, but other than that, there are better sushi places in Henderson."}
{"text":"Excellent, as always. We eschewed the sushi today, and explored the rest of the menu. David had the yakisoba, and i had the tonkatsu. Very, very good!"}
{"text":"I love ,I Love Sushi in the Henderson location ! I've been going there for years since I live nearby.The food is always fresh and consistent !! Always !! The price is right and not overly expensive! Love the wait staff and overall the ambiance of the  Japanese restaurant !Whenever I go there I feel like I'm back in Japan.The waitstaff are so very nice and efficient.I have no complaints whatsoever, the owner of this place should be very proud of  their employees! Five stars for this place!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and consistently good. The Screaming Orgasm and Joes Special are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Finally.  After trying about half a dozen sushi joints in town, I think my wife and I found one we will go back to regularly.  I Love Sushi gained instant credibility because a.) it was actually crowded when we went there (on a Monday no less) and b.) they didn't have some incredibly priced ala carte menu to entice you into their \"all you can eat\" offering.  I think my wife and I would each get our rolls again (I Love Sushi roll, The Mistake roll, some roll that had the word \"nipple\" in it, and another one I forget the name of).  The highlight for me was the sashimi.  For $5 the portion was great.  Three very thick pieces of salmon and incredibly dark/fresh tuna.  The salmon was delicious and maybe the best salmon sashimi I've had, same for the tuna.  In the words Ahhhnold, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"I have known about this place for 3 years but never came because the signage didn't look all that great in the random plaza.   However,  this place is really nice inside,  the staff are wonderful,  and the food is delicious!  If you're out degree fence about coming here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas, hands down! The salmon nigiri is our favorite - the fish is so fresh and will literally melt in your mouth like butter. Bam Bam special is also delicious, along with the dancing eel roll. The owner is also very helpful and nice, he always recognizes us and says hello. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Henderson is such an interesting place - that being said if you're there and want Sushi, they won't disappoint.  Be aware if you bring young children here because a bunch of the rolls are named after sexual positions and experiences lol. Good place to spend a birthday for sure :)"}
{"text":"When I'm at work and my wife messages me \"I want a screaming orgasm\" then I know it's time for some I Love Sushi.  I was in the mood for some sushi too and the Screaming Orgasm along with some Uni, Yellowtail, Unagi, Salmon and beer sounded like a perfect way to end the day of chaos and stress following what happened in Las Vegas on Sunday.  We came here and we were immediately seated and offered drinks.  We then followed it up with some great food and a great time.  It was the perfect way to not think about anything but food and beer for a hour or so.  This is definitely one of the best sushi spots in Vegas and I very much recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it yet."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best sushi places you can possibly eat at. The sushi is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best sushi I've ever had and such a great environment. Everything is so fresh and unique on the menu and of all the times I've gone I've never had a poor experience. The waitresses are great and remember the customer faces and keep me going back! I would highly recommend it to all.  Not only does I love sushi have amazing sushi, but they have great appetizers and other options such as chicken and udon for those who are not fans of sushi. They're desserts are to die for as well!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi in Henderson, maybe even all of Vegas. Service is always pretty good and they have a lot of great sushi chefs who are very friendly when you sit at the bar. They do some really great no rice rolls such as the Johnny roll and Spring Mountain. Its not all you can eat so in my opinion there seafood quality is a little higher. Overall really great sushi spot. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"First of all let me just say that I'm a huge foodie and I love to try new restaurants. I love sashimi and being from Hawaii I've had some of the freshest fish ever, well this place comes really close to it. I love all they're creative sushi rolls, sashimi is super fresh, and they have some good entrees as well. The owners is there almost every night he's very welcoming and they always give you great costumer service, by starting you off with a warm towel to wipe your hands to complimentary cucumber salad. I love this this place and I've been eating here for the past eight years, and it's never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Had the edamame and california rolls. Good food. Ok service."}
{"text":"They don't have any sort of happy hour here, but they give you tons of food for the price.  Their lunch combos are great.. $8-9 for a two-item combo bento box.  I usually get it with Tempura, and Chicken Katsu.  It also comes with Miso, Salad, Egg, Rice, Beancurd Sushi.  I know I'm leaving something out, but I've never seen such a huge bento box.  The dinner combos go up a little bit in price (I think it's $13-14 dollars), but they give you about twice as much Tempura, as well as cucumber salad, regular salad, gyoza, some sort of Tempura fried rice ball.  Again, tons of food for the price.  Another good thing to order here are the teppanyaki plates for about $14.  My girlfriend usually gets the Ribeye one, and it's pretty much just tons of meat, zucchini and onions.  They're served with Ponzu, and another sauce to dip the meat/veggies in.  They also come with Miso, and salad."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas. Screaming Orgasm and kiss of fire...yummm!!! I won't eat sushi anywhere else"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the top places in the country for sushi (not just in Henderson, NV)! I have been here several times.   We were a group of 5 and we ordered it up! We had Burning My Stomach, Boom Boom Nipple Special, Kitchen Sink, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Deep Fried Cheesecake.  I'm know I'm missing some things. We shared everything.   That Deep Fried Cheesecake is everything! It tasted like a delicious funnel cake, lol.  And there's something to eat for everyone. Even if you are not a \"sushi\" person.   By the way, you can tell they get creative with naming their meals, lol. The names will make you laugh and think \"I can't believe they named it that!\"  Service is fantastic! The staff is so active, quick, and friendly. This is a great place for family and/or friends to have a great time.   Prices: I would say it's moderate ($$).  They make everything at time of order. Groups are always coming through here because they can easily share the food and share the bill. ;-)  If it was too expensive, I would think most locals wouldn't be coming  on a nightly busy.   Location: it's located in a shopping plaza near Sunridge Heights.  I love sushi! What move can I say, but just go and check them out!"}
{"text":"Sadly after my husband I both got food poisoning I have to take off a couple stars. If you like rolls - this still is the best place in Vegas to go ! Their cooked food is decent as well. If you're a sashimi/nigiri fan I would take your business down the street to En."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH. Don't even read the reviews just go!!!!! Everything is so fresh and perfectly put together, just well balanced. My boyfriend and I come here once a week and it's our favorite sushi spot ever. Our favorites are: -flower roll -sun devil -one night stand -double D -alligator roll"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've had but it's ok. ILS serves typical Vegas-Korean style junky rolls with quality ingredients, but are just covered in waaaay too much sauce.   Also, and maybe it's just me, but I'm so sick of all the dumb roll names. Really? Does every sushi joint need to serve \"orgasm sauce?\" One Yelper described this as \"ingenious.\" Wrong \"I\" word--more like \"idiotic.\" And there's like a million selections with just one ingredient varying in each. It took me a solid 15 minutes to order two rolls to go. Too much work.   I'd rather go somewhere else without the insane lists and just get a good freaking roll not drowning in a mayo-based bodily-fluid referenced sauce."}
{"text":"This place is the reason why I started liking sushi... I tried it out a couple months ago and now I go back AT LEAST once a week. My favorites are\"I Love My Ass\" and \"Triple X.\" The staff is friendly and the manager is always around to make sure everyone is happy with their dining experience. Nowhere else satisfies my sushi cravings except I Love Sushi!"}
{"text":"The fish really is incredibly fresh and consistently high-quality.  The price is also very reasonable.  Also the rolls are, over all, pretty traditional.   Overall, I like the place.  It's a good neighborhood joint.  It is a great place that will never let you down."}
{"text":"Gotta give this place 5 stars - fast attentive service, relaxing atmosphere and most of all quality sushi at a reasonable price.  I recommend the signature I Love Sushi roll if you like spicy excellence."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas. Very very very fresh sashimi!! Friendly staff!!! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"IMO the best rolls I have ever had. We had 4 for lunch and of course I ordered and as usual over ordered. Everything we tried was superb and very fresh. Large portions for the cut rolls and some very unique combos. They have a huge menu with well over a hundred different combos of rolls some fried but most just very healthy sushi."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place . Ordered the crunch roll and the sashimi cocktail! Sooooo goood !!!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat rolls. They proved me wrong that 'sushi' isn't always about nigiri and sashimi. Atmosphere is great, the rolls hardly have any rice, and tons of fresh fish....mmm.. I LOVE, I LOVE SUSHI!! The bill may be pricey because its not all you can eat, BUT nonetheless its worth every grain of rice!!! Trust me, I've only been doing ayce at sushi houses for the past six years only because I didn't believe in getting full off of rolls. But I LOVE SUSHI can create some badass dishes!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down, my favorite sushi restaurant! My favorite items include the: Screaming Orgasm, Burning Your Stomach roll and the Jackpot roll, just to name a few. I've been going here for years. There's no all you can eat option, but the food is just so amazing!"}
{"text":"As sushi places go, I Love Sushi is just fine. The fish was fresh, if unremarkably presented. The edamame was a bit overdone, and the pods were not nearly as fresh and green as I've had in other places, and the miso soup was just OK. Before we ordered we were given a little taste teaser of cucumbers drenched in a vinegary concoction; might have been nice but the cukes were pretty soggy.  Prices are extremely fair, no issues there.   The waitress gave us a warm towels for our hands before beginning our meal, a nice touch!  The atmosphere is comfortable; it is a large restaurant with white tablecloths, and the noise level was nicely muted, not loud at all.  I join other yelpers in wishing for the half-star option, because I would have given I Love Sushi 3-1/2 stars. I rounded down to 3 stars, because as the service was excellent, it was also somewhat mechanical, but mostly I rounded down because of the aforementioned glitches with the edamame and cucumber teaser.  I will say that based on the many sushi restaurants I have patronized, I would rate I Love Sushi as average. I wouldn't hesitate to come here again, but I would probably choose another restaurant if given the choice."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here! Been to different japanese place and this is second to none... Their food is very good with good ambience... Even though, this place is way far from where I live... im still going to drive just to eat here because their food is worth it... the staff are wearing japanese clothes, they are friendly and approachable.... They are very knowledgeable with the menu..."}
{"text":"I usually love this place but sub par tonight ; I think they were too busy for their good. And the service was ok... But I thought it was weird when another waitress grabbed our check (at the end) and checked the tip. Get it together guys!"}
{"text":"Where do you go for some off strip sushi to die for? \"I Love Sushi\" of course. I didnt know what to expect especially from a place called I Love Sushi, let alone it being located in a strip mall. Boy we're we surprised. This place was huge and had about 20 sushi chefs working behind the counter. The place was packed on a Tuesday night. I think the place seats about 200 easily. Wow. The food was awesome. AWESOME. The rolls were about $12-15 each but boy were they worth it. I guess one of the gimmicks of this place is the names of the rolls. Screaming Orgasm, Taste Like My Ex Girlfriend, Fat A$$ Special, and so forth. Regardless about the name, the flavor was top top notch. This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat at. Even though the names and description mention \"special chef sauce\", they are all different sauces that are highly recommended by the sushi chefs. I read somewhere there was a total of 81 chefs that are employed there. Here's a list of rolls we had:  (Check out the pictures I added to the I Love Sushi page. Warning: May cause a craving for some Sushi!)  Jackpot Roll - I dont remember the exact description but its a fried tempura roll with spicy mayo sauce. Spider Roll - Soft Shell Crab Screaming Orgasm - Seared Tuna in chef special sauce Fat Ass Roll - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, crab meat, avocado, deep fried panko, spicy mayo, hot sauce & eel sauce. I Love Sushi Special - Spicy tuna & cucumber topped with tuna & spicy special sauce Double D roll - Raw Salmon and tuna on a roll and then into the yummy sauce Dragon Roll - Lotsa lotsa Unagi. Baked Scallop Mushroom"}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than five stars, I would. This is the best sushi I've ever had. My husband I and have to go here at least once a month. It gets busy around the dinner rush but they move tables really quickly. The sushi is always fresh and comes out really fast. Here are some suggestions: screaming orgasm, kiss of fire, mountain roll, Ryan's special, double d roll, threesome special... Everything is good. I've honestly never had a roll here that I don't like. The rolls are big so don't over order!   A definite must if you're in the Vegas/Henderson area!"}
{"text":"The location and exterior of this place don't seem promising (behind a gas station) but don't let that fool you. This place is quite a hidden gem. Great sushi and bento boxes. I'm particularly hooked on their fish tempura and beef teriyaki which are on their lunch special. Sushi chefs are always pleasant."}
{"text":"Typical selection of sushi without the Strip restaurant prices. Basic decor but with friendly and very attentive staff. It's a good choice for a casual no frills meal. Quiet atmosphere. I did not have a reservation and don't know if they take them but on a Late Wednesday afternoon I was able to get seated right away."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here for my sushi cravings. Not AYCE but delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"\"I Love Sushi\" is easily my favorite sushi place in the Vegas Valley. Sure, it doesn't have the private garden, koi pond, and waterfall of \"Mizumi\" at Wynn Casino, but it doesn't have the same high prices, either. The fish may not also be as high quality as the product at \"Bar Masa\" in Aria (which only uses fish that have been out of Japan's waters for 24 hours or less), but I've never heard any complaints from anyone I've brought there.   The menu at \"I Love Sushi\" is extensive -- especially the amazing sushi roll options -- and the atmosphere is usually fun and lively. The creative sushi roll names always elicit laughs from first-time visitors and it's a great place for a casual date or group outing with friends. It's definitely a place that can get kind of loud, however, with a casual environment that's usually not conducive to a quiet romantic dinner (especially on a busy weekend night).   I always start off with the spicy edamame and some of my favorite menu items are the Kiss of Fire, Screaming Orgasm, and John Holmes.    If you're in the mood for great sushi and you don't want to deal with the hassle and high prices of a trip to the Strip, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Residents in the Anthem\Seven Hills area are SO lucky! This place is easily the best sushi in the desert especially for the price. Quality, Freshness, and Service are always top notch. It's so hard to go to an AYCE joint shortly after I Love Sushi, you notice a BIG difference right away.   I had frequented this place to the point of exhaustion back when I lived in Henderson. Now, living over 20 miles away, I crave it almost every month and MUST make the trip over. The variety of rolls makes it easy to find something that combines every kind of sushi you enjoy (i.e. Mistake Roll). The service is always the right mix of attentiveness and consideration. Most of all the prices are a value for the quality (but not on the lowest end of the spectrum).  My verdict is if you are looking for a great place to have sushi ESPECIALLY if you're lucky enough to be in the area, you must RUN not walk to I Love Sushi."}
{"text":"Best place! I love the something wrong 7! So amazing... The warm towel welcome is certainly a nice touch! Great atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Love their sushi here.  So fresh and a variety of rolls with dynamic flavor that will explode in your mouth!  There are too many rolls to name on this post.  If you like green tea- theirs takes the prize in town.  It's a vibrant great scene with equally great service!  Can get a little crowded on weekends so take that to note, but they offer sushi bar seating and have a lot of tables available so the wait is minimal."}
{"text":"Food was fine, presentation was nice as they bring large enough orders out on sushi boats. Service was awful though, waited 20 minutes for them to take our second order. Overall 3/5."}
{"text":"This is not AyCE but truly and enjoyable reasonably priced meal. The service was exceptional. Nice decor. Large portions. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Nothing to love about the food. Would give it minus 3 stars, but rating system doesn't allow it.  The food is NOT fresh and utterly disgusting.  I ordered takeout so cant comment about the restaurant, but if the food is any reflection of the quality and cleanliness of the place, it cant be good. THE worst sushi i have had. Stay away."}
{"text":"I love sushi! And this place has really great sushi. The Gary special roll is delicious, and I always get the simple philidalphia roll. It's always yum!   I think the service here lacks a little bit. All my favorite waitresses always end up leaving and they tell me it's because of the management and everything's disorganized. I also always feel like I'm being rushed out. Especially during the dinner rush"}
{"text":"Excellent service & yummy Quality food every time. One of the very Best in Henderson hands down."}
{"text":"Love the name, love the place. I have been here a few times over the years, I'd be there so much more if it wasn't on the other side of town.  I have never had a complaint. I always get their Edamame and Spider Roll, my favorites. This time we also got the Sexy Time Special Roll, which I really liked...nice amount of hot with great contrasting textures. And the Dragon roll, eel..yum! Staff is always great. Fun atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"So I checked this place out today at lunch.  It smelled fresh, clean and the place was busy. I'm looking for an AYCE place and this place doesn't offer it. Too bad. I'm on the hunt again!"}
{"text":"My best experience was sitting at the sushi bar and eating whatever the chef made for me. I told him I preferred cooked fish over raw, and he definitely made my taste buds and tummy happy. If I can remember the O'Ryan roll was fab!  Each time I've been here, I've had no problem with service. And, I love their huge selection of crazy-innovative sushi rolls. I have yet to find a place like this in SD!  It's also super spacious inside. I love eating here whenever I'm in town. If you end up eating here, be fun and adventurous and try something new!   Prices for the rolls are a little higher, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The honest truth about I Love Sushi is that it isnt amazing, but it is a solid, never-fail option. Ive eaten here dozens of times because I know its easy to get to, is a huge restaurant (so its pretty easy to get a table), has a huge selection, and I know everyone can find something they will like.  The fish is always fresh, but never mindblowing. The servers are always somewhere between rushed and friendly, but never rude. The portions are large, the prices are on the mid-high end and the presentations are always interesting. Because it is so popular there is sometimes a wait, especially on weekend evenings, but it has never been too long. Sometimes the front counter people can get a bit snippy, but overall this is a very safe bet where I have never had any issues and have always come out satisfied."}
{"text":"The sushi menu is plentiful, with lots of choices. Whether you want Sashimi, plain rice and fish, or really cool roll creations, this place has it. The fish is fresh and delicious. I know sushi, and this place is really good! There are rolls that I do not care for, yet only because I do not like the taste of some of the ingredients, while my friends think those are the bomb!  The service is very friendly, and the atmosphere is a happy one.  I have been here 7 times, and plan on continuing to go back. Easy to park and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's so sad that one of my favorite places has gone downhill.  2 years ago, it was the best.  The service and food aren't what they used to be.  I am not a fan of mediocre service, and lukewarm/cold food.  I will have to find somewhere else to enjoy Sushi.  It won't be at I Love Sushi."}
{"text":"I LOVE Sushi is a fun place to go. It's very busy, so I assume with the amount of people dining here, the fish is fresh. We ordered several different items, loved them all. I will go back again!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and have a great experience every time. The screaming orgasm and kiss of fire are my favorites without a doubt. Everything I've had is wonderful. The owner greets you at the door, and the chefs take great care of you when sitting at the sushi bar. Can't recommend highly enough!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for about six years now. For the sushi lovers, if you're looking for a a wide variety of sauced up rolls, this is the place for you. With over a hundred rolls, they hit almost every combination possible. If I'm in the mood for a roll that might not be standard at other sushi restaurants, I'll stop here. There's also some nice bento box lunch specials if your not in sushi mode.  Definitely be prepared to spend a few extra dollars. Rolls range from just under $10 to up to $15. Two rolls does me just right. Since it's not an AYCE restaurant, I usually don't get any nigiri because it would be too costly. Burning Your Stomach and Something's Wrong 69 are two tried and true rolls for me. The menu gives good descriptions of every roll so take your time and look if you've never been there, there should be something for you.  Lunch does get busy, but dinner time turns into a mad house. Your best bet is to go mid afternoon. The servers can be short and communication can be an issue, but for the most part, they get the job done. Certain servers recognize us and take good care of us.  If you'd like a little more seclusion, the booths along the walls are sort of enclosed and may be a good place to sit if you're conducting business. You'll get an order of edamame and a cucumber salad to whet the palate when you first sit down. Even though the prices are elevated, I'll continue to frequent I Love Sushi because I think they're rolls are worth it and so do the customers that pack the house pretty much every night."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local sushi place!  Ambiance: I love sushi is always buzzing with customers sitting both at the bar and in booths and in tables. The servers and managers learn who you are when you come often so you truly do feel at home. It's casual in decor and comfort.  Food: sometimes we ravage our food so quickly that we don't remember the names of what we ordered! We do remember enjoying a 80% something and a sex on the beach and a mistake something lol. There's raw and baked and cooked rolls for everyone to try! We love getting \"easy rice\" so there's not as much rice cramping our style tasting the fishy deliciousness! There's also great calamari! The drinks selection includes just enough house wine and beer and sake selection to get you through your meal.   I love Sushi makes Sushi to order that's quick and amazing and perfect to get your fix!"}
{"text":"Pretty dang good!  They have so many rolls with really funny names. Personally, the \"I love my ass roll\" is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"The two best rolls on planet earth: Somethings Wrong #69 & I Love My Ass.  I also really enjoyed the Screaming Orgasm =-)"}
{"text":"Straight up great sushi place! One of my favorites for sure.  It is not all you can eat so the quality is a bit better and more carefully made. My usual bill for 2 people comes to about $58 seemingly every time.  Super White Tuna Nigiri is great, Miso soups, Jackpot roll is my favorite.  I've also had one of the boats as seen by my photo. The Lisa Handroll also pictured is my favorite.    I found out about this place because an asian friend who is a waitress at another sushi restaurant told me to check it out.  Then on second thought she said \"dont go there, then you will not come back here anymore\" as it was her favorite spot also. She was right. Luckily I live close by so I can go to this place whenever i want if in the mood for high quality sushi at a very reasonable price.   The place is always busy which is a good sign! I usually go mid day so I never have to wait to long to be seated but I imagine it is slammed around dinner time."}
{"text":"And love it I do!  This place is quite a bargain.  I stopped in for lunch and for $15, two of us were able to split a combo that included three rolls and 4 pieces of sushi!  The sushi was sprinkled with sesame seeds, which was new to me and enjoyable.  The Montreal roll was also quite tasty.  There is not much here in the way of ambiance, but I enjoyed sitting on the balcony and watching the goings on on the block while dining.  I would highly recommend this place for a delicious lunch."}
{"text":"This place has way too much hype. Most of the rolls that I ordered were over kill with yum yum sauce or cream cheese. When I left I had an overwhelming mayo taste in my mouth that would not go away. Want better suggestions for Sushi, Sakana on Maryland and Flamingo, Sushi Wa Eastern and Coronado, Sushi Twister Boulder and Tropicana."}
{"text":"This place is the bombbbbbb.   Two things struck me the most: The exceptional SERVICE! I loved how attentive my waiter was. Patient and not pushy. Nice and helpful, called attention to the chefs when he didn't know the answer to something (we were sitting at the bar) and overall fantastic. And of course the food was fab.   We ordered the Johnny's Roll ( see attached picture) which had soft shell crab and albacore. DELICIOUS. It was elegant and simple. Their selection of rolls is far and extensive and it's quite difficult to even pick but you really can't go wrong with anything that's in their $13 price point. Also, I feel like their deluxe rolls all have a variation of some soft shell crab in it ... Next time I would try Gary's Roll(soft shell crab with yellowtail and salmon!!) . But the albacore was incredibly good that night.   Hamachi collar and salmon collar (see attached picture). Delicious and big portions. Salmon collar seemed to have more food though but both were done well.   1 order each of tuna, salmon, yellowtail and albacore sashimi. (Attached picture) At $5 an order, I expected it to be a bigger cut. Sure it was good and fresh, but the pieces were puny and uneven.    Lastly we tried nabeyaki udon (not pictured :( ), a mix of tempura shrimp and veggies. I only had some broth and hands down, it was done very well. For the price however $11.95, I thought the portions were small.   Overall, very pleased with my servers at the bar, all male, who were all super attentive!! (I asked for one plate and he brought out a bunch for my entire family without asking) and continually checked up on us in a non pushy way.   Come here early though, this place gets crowded!!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for sushi, but it has to be good and authentic for me to give a 5 star rating and I love Sushi passed for both!  We came here with some LV locals on our way back from Lake Powell and it was just what we needed.  We ordered so many different rolls that I couldn't just pick one that was better than the other.  The spicy garlic edemame  was great too.  Plenty of free parking also."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a bunch of times, but we aren't regulars here. We went last night again after quite some time, and we both asked each other why we don't come here every time we are in the mood for sushi?!?!  It's not all you can eat, so the price point is a little higher. So if you're drunk and looking to eat tons and tons of food, I Love Sushi probably isn't your best bet. It's kind of nestled in the back of the shopping center with Walgreens and a Wendy's so it's not easily seen.  We always order the same roll, which I will post a picture of and it's probably the best roll I've ever had in my entire life. It has fried onions! And it's huge. If I went alone, i could only eat this roll.   The other rolls I've had were all very good also, but hands down the roll with the onions is a MUST!!  The sashimi cuts are huge. It's probably double to triple the size of what you would get at an all-you-can-eat restaurant.   Fast service, there's like 15 chefs behind the bar. The waitresses are all attentive, we had a few come up and check on us even though she wasn't our waitress. And I think the owner even came up and asked how everything was. Such a great restaurant. You MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and fresh every single time we are here! There's no other Sushi restaurant in town that can be compare to I LOVE SUSHI, and we have tried many! Whenever we have guest visiting, we always try and take them here. We highly recommend this place!!! ENJOY!"}
{"text":"The food tasted good. My husband ordered an order of yellowtail sushi, tuna sushi, and salmon sushi. When he was chewing I could hear him crunching down on something very hard. He hurt his tooth. He spit it out and it was a small rock from in the rice. Luckily I only ordered sashimi! We will definitely not be going back.   Wash your rice!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in the city. They don't do AYCE, but if you want great quality sushi this is the place to go. They have a huge specialty roll menu. My favorite items are the Bonsai Roll, Screaming Orgasm, I Love Sushi Roll, and Double Dragon Roll. They usually are pretty busy, but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Vegas. It's more expensive but I don't even care, its just sooo good!!!  The Quail egg shooters are amazing, comes with 3 eggs in 1 shooter!  The sweet shrimp sashimi comes with 3 pieces and this deep fried shrimp thing that was delicious! The almost 90% special is great too!! I also love the cucumber salad and the garlic pepper edamame.  Today they had Toro, Yumm!!"}
{"text":"This used to be the closest sushi place to where I lived...and it was BRUTAL. I tried so many times to give I Love Sushi my love, but every time, they gave mediocre rolls and really stringy cuts of fish.  They don't offer a lot of decent combos -- maybe it was just me, but every combo I was interested in threw something gross in the mix that I wasn't into at all. Their prices aren't cheap, the place is kind of dingy, and takeout is really slow.  I think they've opened a couple new sushi places east of I Love Sushi...I'd recommend checking them out before going here."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in all of Las Vegas and Henderson. If you want good sushi you come here. They will make you anything you want whether it is on the menu or not. The best and freshest Seafood I've ever had since living in San Francisco. You can't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"Very good, very fresh and very fast. Not too expensive and worth every penny.  The edamame appetizer and cucumber appetizers that were complimentary and I would order the cucumber appetizer even if it was expensive because it is dynamite. I had the flower roll which was delicious. The roll list is a little overwhelming at first but many awesome options. The sashimi was great. Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time about a week ago for lunch and liked it so much that I got carryout for dinner the same day!  The prices here are higher than I normally pay for nigiri sushi, but the pieces of fish are possibly half again the size that you get at Sushi Mon or Yummy Grill Sushi, so you get more for the money.  The ikura is GREAT- fresh and huge!  I tried their inari and liked that as well- not overly sweet , overly wet or overly dry, and the soy \"pockets\" have a nice texture- I'm picky about my inari and theirs is my favorite so far.     I had lunch there on a weekday around noon and the place filled up pretty rapidly. But service was slow before it filled up- I think the waitress forgot we were there or assumed we'd need more time to decide.    The names of their sushi are ridiculous- one even has the word \"a$$\" in it!  The names don't seem to correspond to the food at all (what do you put in a sushi roll called \"Whose Your Pimp?\" anyway?), and the silly names don't jibe with the formal decor and politeness of the waiters either.  I would have been embarrassed to ask one of those nice ladies for that \"a$$\" roll!  :-D  Is this place good for kids?  Well, the food's great.  Just hide that menu from them!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT and attentive services, food is fresh, the combo dinner was a bit salty to my taste"}
{"text":"Great food and authentic japanese style...lots of action and friendly with chefs. Nice big bar to sit and watch your creations. Awesome roll selection."}
{"text":"I came here from out of town when I visited my friend. This place is delicious! Even though Vegas is nowhere near large bodies of water, the fish seemed really fresh.  Their service was good and friendly, and I liked that my cup of tea never went empty. Prices were reasonable as well, especially given the quality. You can't beat the names of their rolls. The specialty rolls are HUGE. My friend and I were stuffed sharing two specialty rolls and a maki roll.  If you're in Las Vegas and in the mood for Japanese food, make your way to I Love Sushi if you can!"}
{"text":"I really love the sushi here. It's a very modern, Americanized, sushi experience. However, the quality of fish is excellent so if you're in a more traditional sushi mood you will enjoy the toro, yellowtail, albacore, and salmon. But if you're ready to utilize all of your taste buds they have some of the most delicious and creative rolls in the city. \"I love my ass\" and \"tastes like my ex girlfriend\" are favorites of mine, but I would highly recommend starting with a spicy tuna hand roll. When I lived in Vegas I was a regular here, and when I come back to visit I try to make a point to hit this place at least once."}
{"text":"When in Vegas and you have time to get away from the strip - this is the sushi place to eat at!   They have a large variety of rolls, all the fish taste very fresh. Service is great, our server was prompt and checked in with us frequently. Can't wait to come back and try more of their rolls, I'm sure they are all delicious!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sushi restaurant in the area.  So many good rolls to choose from with excellent quality fish being served there at reasonable prices.  And you gotta love a place with such crazy names for rolls."}
{"text":"Love their sushi, awesome,  Good service, we always eat at the sushi bar.  Unique and fun names to some of their signature rolls."}
{"text":"Love the Agadashi tofu, Spider Roll and the salmon sashimi!  The warm towels prior to dining is a nice touch!  This place is always packed on the weekends so be prepared to wait!  I'm definitey becoming a fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Food is suspect but service is very good. Haven't been there for a while but went a couple times in the last month. The nigiri had a bad odor and the chef did not do a good job trimming the fish. Screaming O and jalape√±o yellowtail sashimi were also cut poorly.  To top it all off the rice had a rock in it which resulted in a visit to the dentist to fix a filling!  I would choose many of the other local sushi restaurants long before this place."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and everywhere I go I make it a point to find a sushi spot with the sole purpose of finding the perfect sushi. So far I have not been able to find anything that tops my hometown regular sushi spot. Until now! I Love Sushi is that place. Aside from the authentic atmosphere which includes Kimono clad servers and no less than a dozen blade wielding sushi chefs behind the bar, I Love Sushi offers literally the best sushi I have ever experienced. Packed with flavor and texture, their rolls are second to none. Even the simplest spicy tuna roll is comparable to others' master chefs rolls. If you are in the area (even in Vegas) I highly recommend the trip to I Love Sushi. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"This place is always packed but sooo worth it.  Fish is always fresh and service is great.  I normally would choose ayce for sushi but this place is one of the few where it's worth paying for individual rolls.  Something new ... try \"fresh wasabi\" it's definitely way better than the normal wasabi everyone is familiar with.  Only disclaimer ... you'll never want to go back to the normal wasabi ... hahah.  If you love sushi ... why not try this place out."}
{"text":"All I have to start with is, WOW! Loved, I mean love the food... the employees are great and the service was fast. I highly,  highly recommend this place to Sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Hmm....what can I say?  I LOVE SUSHI, but not at this place....  The quality of the sushi was great here, but the prices were just TOO much for what you get. I ordered the Lisa Hand Roll, my friend ordered the \"I Love My Ass\" roll, and Theresa B. ordered the Orgasm one. All tasted great, but it really wasn't enough food for the three of us...our bill came to about $70....  We got 6 pieces of the Lisa Hand Roll, about 6 pieces for the I LOVE MY ASS roll, and a big mess of seared tuna in a mustard sauce...as well as a waitress recommended Korean Black Raspberry wine bottle ($15)...which really tasted like red wine, and didn't fave well with my friends...so we took it home...(shhh!!!)...  The ambiance was pretty nice. It reminded me of a place I went to in Santa Monica called Sushimon...  (Of course this place is Korean owned! I seriously only know one Sushi place that is owned by Japanese...or I think it is...?!)"}
{"text":"It was amazing! The flavor is great. I highly recommend the James Bond roll, the Alaska roll, and the California rolls. Please be careful as some are spicy and raw, so if you have health conditions you should be careful. The food is great and service too. It definitely beats Osaka and Hiroba( other sushi places)."}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The food and the atmosphere is great. I recommend having the \"Frankie Special\", I have to get it every time I go. Second favorite would be \"The Sundevil Roll\". Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love sushi, and this aptly named establishment delivers very good sushi. Armed with a varied menu of sexual innuendo sushi rolls, there is something for everyone.  I love sushi does not do all you can eat which makes it difficult to try different things on a budget but usually means better quality and attention.  Note - 3 stars means A-ok in my book.  To score higher, a restaurant needs to add the other things in that make restaurants appealing.  This is where this experience fell short but I enjoyed the food enough that I will return and hopefully update the review with additional accolades.  What fell short? 1) From the initial seating, we felt rushed. At least 3 times in the first 5 minutes, the sushi chef assigned to us (there must have been about 6 sushi chefs behind the sushi bar) asked us if we wanted to order. It was our first time in this restaurant and we were obviously going over the menu and I thought it less than friendly.  The bar was not overcrowded and there was no danger that other customers would be waiting without a seat.  Once we ordered the food came very quickly.however, when we wanted to make an additional order, we found all 6 chefs staring at a Nets game and not paying attention to the customers.  It literally took 5 minutes to get the chef's attention.  We ordered the sushi dynamite which tasted good however it said it came in a shell but it really comes in aluminum foil which gives it a very tinny taste and really lacks in presentation.  Finally, this is the most overpriced sushi restaurant not located on the strip.  if you order one of the special rolls, it costs nearly as much as an AYCE lunch.  The rolls we tried were good but there was nothing distinctive such as larger portions, better presentation, or fresher fish than a similar AYCE roll.  I do think this place has potential and on a busy night might actually be a fun place for the crowd and chefs."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, and I  Sushi is my favorite!  I've lived in Vegas for decades and have been to plenty of other sushi restaurants in town.  The service has always been great, and I've never had a bad meal. My favorite rolls are Ryan's Roll and the Monkey Roll.  Yes, their prices are a bit high, but I feel it's worth it.  I was actually quite surprised by some of the negative reviews. But, I guess you can't please everybody all of the time."}
{"text":"Solid sushi restaurant. Large variety of rolls--at least 70 different types. Indeed, the screaming orgasm and kiss of fire are delicious! Kindly ask friendly sushi chef J.B. for extra hot sauce. Their flavors & friendliness will not disappoint. Without a doubt, I will be back."}
{"text":"If you are from Cali don't eat at those high price Sushi places on the strip or hotels. This is the place to go and of course you'll need a car to get here.   My girlfriend and I always go to I love Sushi because of the quality of the food and prices. For what you paid to eat Sushi at a fancy hotel you can feed about four people at I love Sushi. The service is friendly and they welcome everyone in their restaurant.  The girls are dress in their kimonos - pretty cool.   Please try I love Sushi if you're ever in Las Vegas and have a car. Trust me you'll be happy that you saved some money and had some good sushi."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi restaurant in the Las Vegas/ Henderson area. Their food is so good and very fresh. I have always had great service there. Their screaming orgasm is delicious. They also have rolls that are wrapped in cucumber instead of rice and I absolutely love those. Everything that I have tried is very good! I would recommend this to anyone who loves sushi!  The only con that I can think of is that they don't offer all you can eat. But besides that I love this place."}
{"text":"Food, service, atmosphere: all fantastic!!   This gem of a sushi restaurant is in a small strip center. It's worth it tho, because once you step in, you're transported to what you would think would have to be an expensive restaurant. However, it's not.   The geisha-inspired waitress brings you hot towels and a palate-cleansing cucumber salad while you peruse the menu.  The sushi is plentiful and has ingenious names like 'Bam Bam' and ' Screaming Orgasm'. We had the Monkey Roll, the crunch roll, the Bam Bam, and some baked mussels. The hot tea is HOT, so be careful! The staff is attentive, the food comes out quickly, and the sushi is fresh off the boat!!   My kids are sushi sharks, and my 9 year old son doubles down on his spice, so this was definitely a place for us. Good stuff, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"What a gem tucked away in the corner of a strip mall in Henderson.  Great food, nice servers, good ambiance.   The delivery of fresh sushi is a bit slow but the wait is well worth it.     The I Love Sushi special is fantastic and I highly recommend it.  This sushi joint has become my new favorite and my \"go-to\" spot.  This place delivers quality fish and just go!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place I've been to, hands down! I love coming here and the owner always remembers us. Last night we had dinner here and brought our 8-month-old along. The staff is very accommodating and came over to interact with our daughter. It's great food and reasonably priced. I always get the Boom Boom Nipple Special... the Bonzai Roll is also good and the Franky Special."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town with great service. They have somethjng for everyone. I just had the fat ass roll. Amazing! And large to where I didn't need another roll! Their baked green mussels are fantastic. The service is also very good. The waitress filled our drinks like 3 times each. The prices are a little more expensive but ur paying for good clean sushi. Rolls can range from $7-$15"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome, lots of variety and inventive rolls and salads. I love the screaming orgasm. It's been around for a while and it's definitely high up on the list of best sushi in Vegas. It's a pretty huge place with a large sushi bar, tables and private booths as well, not as cozy as I prefer, but it does have that rowdy vibe that some of my favourite California places have. The sushi chefs usually end up pretty smashed by the end of the night, which makes things fun."}
{"text":"Still my favorite sushi spot!! I love that every time you walk in, the owner is front and center waiting to welcome you. Staff is always helping each other, very friendly and it's always a great dining experience. The sushi is always on point!! Never had a bad experience and we go 2-3 times a mo almost 2 years now. Any time we have guests in town, that's the go-to restaurant just because it's the best of the best!!"}
{"text":"You'll walk in to I Love Sushi feeling like you are in Tokyo. A lot of wonderful selections on their menu. We ordered several roll specials and everything was amazingly delish! The sushi is nice and fresh. Definitely a hidden gem in Vegas for sushi."}
{"text":"I come here once a week, and I never had a bad experience, even when their super busy on Friday & Saturday nights! they deserve 5 stars because their sushi is the best and their service is amazing! #melsroll  is my favorite."}
{"text":"Scale 1 - 5 Food: 4 1/2 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4  A must have is the Screaming \"O\" #51 and #15   The fish is fresh on the weekend and the menu has something for everyone."}
{"text":"By far the best,freshest Sushi in Las Vegas! Great atmosphere, and always a fun crowd. Even when it's busy there is never a wait."}
{"text":"Authenticity: Korean-run  Food: We had (3) rolls. Alaska roll, rainbow roll and Joe's roll. Each roll had 8 pieces so it was pretty filling and tasty. This is not authentic, Tokyo-style sushi, but works when you are in the mood for crazy rolls. The fish tasted fresh and the place was busy which means good turnover. Crab is imitation - FYI.   Ambiance: a little kitschy, but that makes it fun. Huge sushi bar that wraps around the whole bar. We sat at a table.  Service: Fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Variety of rolls and quality are  I recommend to any sushi lover in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"My sister referred us to I love Sushi and after finding out that they are open to 11pm, I was sold. The ambience is great and definitely welcoming. Everytime, I am in Henderson/Las vegas, I am going to come here."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in the Vegas area.  Great rolls, quite a large list of them, the sushi is good, not great.  Place is filled with regulars, so you know the food is good.  Never have eaten off the menu, can't stay away from the sushi.  I love my ass roll, sexy time roll are both unique and very good."}
{"text":"Been here on several occasions and it's probably the best sushi in Las Vegas/Henderson. Great place to bring friends or family. Lots of delicious courses too in addition to awesome special rolls. Friendly staff and always a great time. Yumyum!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi! Most of the sushi ranges from $4-$15. Their jackpot roll is really good and pretty much anything there with shrimp tempura is good. If you are dining on a weekend, call for reservations or come early. It gets very crowded. Best sushi I've had in the Vegas area and decently priced."}
{"text":"Visited on Saturday September 3, 2016 at 8PM.  This restaurant is located on Eastern & Sundridge Heights (just South of St. Rose Pkwy).    For ambiance, I give this place 10 stars!!!  It's a massive restaurant with japanese paper booths lining the walls and a huge sushi counter in the middle with glass displays of the fresh fish.  All the waitresses are seriously foxy and dressed as geishas.  There is even an old asian man at the door greeting people and shouting orders at the servers.  I dig it!   $63.48 got us two sushi rolls, edamame, two soft drinks, and a dinner entree.  The dinner entree allows you to pick two proteins and then it comes with rice, miso soup, a salad, tempura rice, gyoza, and half an orange.  My husband chose chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu and liked both a lot.  I stole his miso soup and I gotta say it's about the best I've ever had.  It was hot and salty and earthy and had plenty of tofu and seaweed.    I got a sex on the beach roll which consisted of raw spicy scallop, crab, masago, scallion, cucumber, and salmon and then I asked them to add lemon since they don't offer a lemon roll like every other damn sushi place in Vegas. This roll made me gag a little bit but my husband ate it with no problems.   To be fair this was my first time trying raw scallop and I think I don't like it.    The other roll I got was much better and was called the double D roll.  It had tempura shrimp, cucumber, crab, salmon, masago, and avocado.   They brought me a delicious sauce called 69 and I dunked my pieces in there and they were edible.    I had hamachi kama here for the first time and now I see why so many people love it.  It's the \"collar\" of the fish (the area around the flippers but behind the gills).  The fish is so soft and squishy, and also fatty and salty.  It's like a tiny treasure hunt digging around the bones and fins and getting every little morsel out of every nook and cranny.  I used my hands because I'm obviously 3 years old on the inside and have no manners.  I could have eaten 5 of these seriously.   They have literally over a hundred different rolls so I'd say definitely take your time and read all the ingredients and you'll find a roll you like.  For the money I'd rather go to Sakana, Yama, or Goyemon, and enjoy the freedom of AYCE but this place has an amazing ambiance."}
{"text":"Always packed, always fresh, and always good.  The best sushi place on Eastern in the Silverado Ranch/Anthem/Green Valley area.  Service is slow at the tables.  Eating at the bar is so much faster.  The garlic butter roll is crazy good!"}
{"text":"MOST HORRIBLE RESTAURANT EVER. WOULD HAVE GIVEN 0 STAR IF POSSIBLE.  I ordered a delivery. Food came relatively fast, so I was happy...until I saw how pathetic it was. For $18, I got an unagi don with 6 small pieces of unagi and barely any teriyaki sauce. The rice portion was huge, but tasted horrid. My advice, if you want good yet cheap (1/2 the price in I Love Sushi) unagi don, head for Aji Sai just 300m away."}
{"text":"I have been all over the world at every type of sushi restaurant imaginable. Yes, the sushi here is good and surprisingly fresh considering we are here in the desert and not the port of Long Beach. But the sushi business has become very competitive around Henderson and you had better be fresh or you will out of business quickly. I have seen many local sushi restaurants have the sushi come right from the airport via courier to get the freshest fish for the day. I do not know if I love sushi gets their fish this way but each time I have been there it has been fresh.  I have had bad experiences with the staff and management. One time a waitress spilled liquid on my wife's new dress. You would think there would be a voluntary adjustment on the check but I had to argue with the manager to get a few bucks off the bill for dry cleaning IF the dress could be cleaned at all. Another time the fire alarm was going off the entire time we were eating. I understand it is not the fault of the staff but an apology and perhaps a free appetizer would have been nice when the experience literally resulted in a headache."}
{"text":"I must say, this place is surprisingly good!  I definitely would go back!  I can always tell a decent sushi restaurant by their uni, and their uni was DELICIOUS and FRESH.  yum yum yum.  I also had their yellowtail sushi, salmon sushi, hamachi kama, shrimp lover roll, and a sex on the beach.  All of the above were DELISH.  The salmon was whatever, but the yellowtail was really good.  The sex on the beach roll was awesome as well.  They have a wide array of rolls that can suit anyone's cravings.  The service was good, the environment/ambience was good, and I had a really good time there.  Definitely worth trying out people!"}
{"text":"I never complain about food.  This was garbage, literally.  I threw most of my $47.47 in the garbage, and what's in my stomach now doesn't feel too good.  Took an hour and 45 minutes after calling at the hour mark to see if they'd received my order through grubcanada.com.  Soup, tempura, salmon teriyaki: cold.  Sushi and salad: near cooked.  I'm keeping the menu in my drawer with the others except this one has the words \"never again!!!\" written on it."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town! The atmosphere is awesome, and the sushi is great. It's pretty busy but the are quick to seat you."}
{"text":"What can i say...i am a believer...i had heard about this sushi joint but i don't think any of the accounts i heard did it justice.  I am a true fan of authentic Japanse food and sushi but the chefs here put a twist to all your favorites...its like your fantasy sushi and roll combinations coming true.  I had the Triple X roll ,Mistake roll ,Kimchii roll, and Orgasm roll and i put them down in order of preference. The Triple X is most definitely the best roll i have had since i was put on God's green earth.  I don't think the pictures i took came out right, but then again my saliva glands and my mouth was on a trip so i cant blame my hands for wanting to drop the phone and get back to feasting.  Had a few Sake bombs and yet the bill wasn't ridiculous at all. I know its not on the Vegas strip but i highly recommend you take the detour."}
{"text":"I don't think I have been served sushi faster!  The One Night Stand was my fav and our pieces melted in my mouth!! I AM taking away 1 star (it should be more) for the dirty names and insinuations.  I would never be able to bring my kids here and although it was so good I'm hoping to find a sushi place where I don't need to order \"Sex On The Sushi\" or \"Fat Ass Special\". Thank you"}
{"text":"Seriously freaking love this place.  I try to come here whenever i can, usually the weekends when frankie is working.  Best sushi you can get in town hands down.  The service is awesome as well.  Even though its a loud and rowdy atmosphere, its part of the sushi dining experience.  I usually only order 2 rolls, but they really hit the spot.  HIGHLY Recommended.  Order ryans special, its amazing!"}
{"text":"love this place... best little sushi restaurant in LV... prices are good, chefs are great. they give you edamame, and a cucumber appetizer free which is always a plus. i hate penny pinching restaurants!  despite that this place is korean owned and mostly korean chefs, I DONT DISCRIMINATE GOOD ASS SUSHI!!!! fun environment... my fav chef is edwin... he will make special rolls depending on your taste or preference.  when you get to the menu its a little overwhelming. there is like 100 rolls on their sushi menu!   first off... THE UNI IS FRESHHHHHHHH! yellow, fluffy and sweet.  my bf really likes the \"i love my ass roll\". it is super white tuna and spicy tuna,soft shell crab with a special brown sauce... i think it is sesame w/ a hint of mustard seed.  super good... i also get the rolley rice bowl with uni and scallop. this is a masago rice bowl mixed with scallop and topped off with some fresh uni. its like a very fancy chirashi bowl.  i also really like the kanpai roll. it is a yellowtail roll, w/ shrimp tempura, avocado and a ponzu sauce. its raw and yummy.  i love this place. i frequent here at least once a week. highly recommended to others!"}
{"text":"Excellent service & fantastic sushi. This is one of the best sushi restaurants in the Las Vegas area"}
{"text":"I've lived here now approximately 10 months in Henderson, Nevada , But prior to moving here, We have visited Henderson several times and have had the honor to stop in for dinner at the restaurant. This place is Awesome. The names for some of the dishes will make you laugh out loud no kidding. The service is great hands down. When friends or family come to visit and they have a taste for sushi, We take them to enjoy \" I Love Sushi \"  Mr. JP"}
{"text":"We go often - they have good quality product and large portions! Last nite we had the BEST server eva! Her name is Lisa! Be sure to sit in her section."}
{"text":"This is the Best  in Henderson.  My Mom does not like all kinds of sushi but she loves the Mexican Roll, and the  Spicy Salmon. Also has lots of cooked options  for thoes of you who do not like any type of sushi...It is in a small shopping mall but  is large inside.   Try it ....  Only problem with Sushi is no left overs for me."}
{"text":"There were so many options here it was almost overwhelming!  I finally decided on the dancing eel roll which had eel, tempura shrimp, tuna and avocado and a spicy tuna roll. I also tried a piece of the kiss of fire (VERY spicy) and a roll that had mango on top which I can't remember the name of. All in all, they were all very tasty. The prices were right and the service was great. I will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely best sushi and service ever!...i love, I love sushi...favorite rolls are: jackpot roll, kiss of fire, and screaming orgasm....i just love this place! If u haven't been here yet, u've got to give it a try."}
{"text":"Super cool ambiance and the staff is always friendly! It's in an odd and deceiving strip mall location -  highly delicious! Wish they had an AYCE option tho- it's about the same price but just seems like a better value"}
{"text":"5 star service and atmosphere. Menu offers options for the most discerning sushi eaters and non-sushi eaters (ie many baked roll options). I recommend the oyster shooter with quail egg!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while but, my last visit wasn't as pleasant as previous ones. The noise level and seating availability was a nightmare at night because it takes forever to be seated and once you are it's really hard to hold a conversation because of the noise. I was on a date and heard more of the conversations at other tables than my own.  After waiting half an hour to be seated, the waitress led us to a table and ran off. It took the waitress a while to bring just water and once she did she walked off. After we ordered and waited about 40 min, we asked three times about our food and they said it was coming but the food didn't come till about a full hour after we ordered. The food was messy and was not at a desirable temperature. It seemed like they had neglected our food. I liked the fish in previous years but, the fish when I went did not look fresh and I got sick later that night. I will probably not return because of the last visit."}
{"text":"We just moved here and discovered this place on yelp. I want to repay the favor and give it a good review based on our experience so others can give it a try and enjoy great sushi!!  Have been twice in the last two months. This will be our go to place for sushi! Excellent customer service. We ordered the last call, one night stand and one other I can't remember the name off the top of my head. Either way, give them a try. Won't be disappointed unless it's a fluke."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!  I eat here at least once a week sometime twice!!    Favorite Rolls: Japanese Lasagna & Threesome Special & LOVE the house salad  Husband's Spicy Favorite's: Sun Devil, XXX, Burn your Stomach  Kids Love the California Rolls  For desert we had the tempura ice cream and the tempura cheesecake.  Neither were delicious enough that I would order them again.  The service is ALWAYS great."}
{"text":"My most FAVE sushi place. Their rolls are on the pricey side and there's no all you can eat BUT their rolls are so worth it. Each roll I've had there has so many flavors and it always tastes fresh. They come in good size portions and not the small kind where you see in reg sushi spots."}
{"text":"Cannot go wrong with this choice. The fish is very fresh and the rolls are exceptional. Try the yellowtail sushi, it's absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, people really don't love I Love Sushi. What am I missing? Sure, clearly from my three star rating it's not the best in town, but it's definitely A OK.   I dined in way back when, and it was as many TO sushi places are, clean and with shockingly long menus. More recently, I ordered them from Just Eat and had a sushi dinner for two with leftovers for under $35 dollars with tip. Not bad.   My only dig is their California roll is brutal. I hate that minced up fake crap instead of chunks. But this is fairly minor, considering the rest of it was fresh, delicious and went down well with their larger-than-average miso soups."}
{"text":"Once again, another awesome expierence at I Love Sushi on Eastern. Since I already wrote a review earlier that states how much I enjoy this restaurant, let me just add this little bit:  You know you ordered to much sushi for two people when the waitress says....   ::Server:: Are you sure you want to order all that? It's enough for 4-5 people.   ::ME:: Yes.... were fat. :)"}
{"text":"We grew up in LV, but now live in LA. We don't get back much, but this place has become our reason for going more often. Honestly!  I Love Sushi, is by far the best sushi restaurant my wife and I have ever eaten at. Now, we are not easy to please either. We are both what our friends consider,sushi snobs. I have to admit that I hated the name of the restaurant, and almost didn't go because I thought it couldn't be good...that would have been a huge mistake.  I will tell you, we put this place through the test. We ordered several rolls, salmon sushi, and a variety of other items. We were stuffed when we left, and could not stop talking about how awesome it was.  The service is friendly, FAST, and all around fantastic!  In one word...GO!"}
{"text":"I really love I Love Sushi. Love to sit at the bar and just gaze at all that beautiful fish. My favorite is the Washington roll, but I've also tried others. Everything is good. I even broke my \"raw only\" sushi rule and tried their 4x4 on the recommendation of a friend. Wow, was it good!  Love the atmosphere, love watching the well trained chefs perform their magic. We're never disappointed.   Sushi isn't cheap, but I feel this place gives me my money's worth."}
{"text":"Good food and good service! Manager constantly walks around to make sure everyone is happy. Favorite sushi place in Vegas so far!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. I love the menu. Come hungry!! The rolls are huge. You really get your moneys worth. It is the best in Nevada!!!"}
{"text":"I am a SUSHI ADDICT!! I need to have it at-least 3-4 times a week... and my choice is always I LOVE SUSHI... I moved from Los Angeles about 5 years ago and found out about I Love Sushi only 2 years ago. Lets just say I would visit family in LA atleast twice a month (so that i could eat sushi.) I think I Love Sushi has the freshest fish and the best selection of sushi, sashimi and rolls.   Screaming Orgasm, Spring Mountain Roll, ALmost 90%, I Love My Ass and Lisa Hand Roll are some of my all time favorites!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've had in a long time. Definitely my go to sushi spot. The Ryan's roll and screaming orgasm was on point."}
{"text":"Like the vibe in this place, seems like your really in Japan grinding down on some good sushi. I always come back. Friendly staff always a plus."}
{"text":"I LOVE SUSHI!  Just got back from my umpteenth dinner at I Love Sushi. It's one of my favorite places to eat here in Vegas, esp with a group so we can order lots of different sushi.  We try different things off their large sushi menu (it's almost overwhelming!) and always end up with a new favorite - I usually also order either a rainbow roll or spider roll because they are my favorites. They have something for everyone - basic sushi, spicy, mozzarella filled, baked, deep fried - so. much.sushi!!  The decor and costumes are cute, and sometimes the service is slow cause they are usually very busy - but we always have a great meal here and I think it's the best priced sushi in Vegas! The sushi is the only thing I've ordered here, I don't think I've ever been in a group where something has been ordered off the menu..."}
{"text":"God, I have no idea why my relatives love this place.  The only thing I can think of is because they are from Utah and to them this is awesome japanese food.  Perhaps it was because we were in a big group which really shouldn't have an effect on anything but the service was piss poor.  So we ordered our food and gave the waitress the sushi ordering paper at the table.  Simple sushi...Inari, Tamago and California roll.  Easy right?  Should be out in 10-15 minutes!  That sushi came out when we were halfway done with dinner.  We ordered sake also, which we had to remind the waitress we ordered it because she forgot all about it.   So all in all...this palce goes down in my book worse than what I orginally rated it."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had out here in NV to date."}
{"text":"This has been my go to sushi place for a few years now. Never have had bad service or bad fish here, always consistent. A couple of my favorite rolls are the Double D (No idea what is in the sauce but it is awesome) and the crazy horse. I always get spicy tuna, yellowtail and usually a hand roll as well.   The decor Inside is great with a very Japanese feel and staff wearing kimonos. They also have a large sushi bar. They do not have AYCE which will steer some people away but Its worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi fan but decided to give it another try. First time coming here by the way. Very friendly service. Restaurant was full but food was brought to our table in a timely manner. Food was great! I was getting food here and there and picking on everyone's plate in my table and it was good lol."}
{"text":"Amazing. Fresh high grade fish.  One of the best Sushi places in town.  Highly recommend this place.  Higher grade sushi than most other joints in town."}
{"text":"I Love Sushi! I really do and I love this place.  Got here late on a Sunday night around 10PM and was seated promptly with my family.  Ordered a few rolls:  - Salmon Lovers Roll. Probably the best roll we had. The salmon just melts in your mouth and it's wrapped around a thick piece of avocado.  The sauce was light enough to enjoy and not too overpowering. We liked it so much we got another one.  There's no rice in this one.  - Screaming Orgasm. Seared Ahi. What more can you ask. Fish was fresh. Sauce was good in this one as well. Available in small or large orders.  - Washington Roll.  I wasn't too much of a fan of this roll.  There was something about the consistency that didn't go right. It felt like too much was going on.  - Mountain Roll.  I for one really loved this roll. It's a california roll topped with salmon and baked.  Loved the sauce on this one.  - Honey Roll.  Deep Fried. This was tasty. Not the best roll we had but not the worse roll.  - Tempura Udon.  Someone in my party had this. I had a few bites and thought it was okay.  I love how they give free edamame.  Overall, I would come back here again if I was in town."}
{"text":"My cousin turned me on to this place with all the delicious pictures of her meal here that she posted on social media.  We decided to give it a try. There's ample parking, the restaurant is large and has a u shaped sushi counter with tables and booths on both sides. I like to begin my sushi meals with an order of salmon sashimi or sushi depending on my mood. I judge places by the quality of their salmon and the cut of the salmon here was thick and long. Very generous!   The menu was a little overwhelming so I recommend looking at the hundreds of pictures on Yelp to help you decide what to order. You definitely need to know what the right things to order are. I like everything we ordered but we were only there for a quick bite so we only tried 3 things. I can't wait to return to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"My love for I love sushi will grow each and every time I get the opportunity to go. Back in 2010 I went here for my friends birthday and tried sushi for the very first time, and I was in love. The chefs put so much love and craft into each roll, it's no wonder this place is one of the best to go to for sushi in Las Vegas. After trying many different rolls I tried the Crunch Roll and it has always stuck. It's actually what I compare other rolls to to decide how good it actually is. I've yet to find one in Reno that is as delicious as the Crunch Roll. I finally got to come back to I love sushi for the first time since 2012 when I moved and it felt like coming home. Nearly everything was the same, including quality of sushi and exceptional service. Ofcourse I got a Crunch Roll, and ofcourse it lived up to my expectations. I wish I love sushi had an all you can eat option, but I never expect that to happen."}
{"text":"I love sushi is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in all of the Henderson and Las Vegas area. Food is always fresh service is always wonderful. My favorite thing to eat there is the Screaming O. The sauce on it is mouthwatering yummy goodness."}
{"text":"Always busy and always good, I Love Sushi is close to my house and an excellent late evening choice (they're open till 11PM, later than many places off the strip).  Not my favorite place for sashimi, but they have a great roll selection.  Many people love the Sushi Nachos, but they were gross to me.  Everything else I have tried on the menu is excellent.  An interesting baked roll is the volcano."}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi Restaurant in Las Vegas.  It's a blast sharing great food with friends, and I Love Sushi knows how to help you have a great time, while preparing the best Sushi around.  Thank you I LOVE SUSHI!  you are the best.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Family favorite, even though we are mostly eating vegan now.   Favorites:  Screaming orgasm  Flower roll  Kitchen sink  Put your hands up   Dinner is better than lunch and quality can be hit and miss (compared to 10 years ago when it was always a hit) but still the best spot in town."}
