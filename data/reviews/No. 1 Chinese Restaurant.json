{"text":"horrible....Food taste so nasty..Its right next to a dog grooming place and they got our order wrong and when we called them they said \" ok don't eat the chicken we want it back\" eww they resold it.. food taste old"}
{"text":"Best wonton soup around. Prices are reasonable, it's a shame they aren't doing well financially"}
{"text":"Average food, unreliable delivery. They told us our food would be delivered within 45 minutes. Over an hour later we called asking where our order was, they said it was on it's way. 20 minutes later we called again and got the same response, further questioning revealed the order hadn't left the restaurant yet. We canceled our order.  I understand a takeout restaurant can get overwhelmed, especially on a Friday night. The reason we won't order from them again is that it seems to me they knowingly misrepresented their ability to fulfill our order.  We have successfully ordered from them other times and found the food okay but not noteworthy. Unfortunately \"No. 1 Chinese\" is one of the very few options in this area."}
{"text":"Their general tsos chicken is decent although it is not hot, it's sweet and their fried rices are average. The reason for 1 star is this place charges extra for everything! If you want fried rice with a meal it's $2 to swap the white rice. If you want shrimp fried rice it's $3. When you order unless you clearly specify a size they won't ask and will automatically charge you for a large. I ordered chicken in cashews and it was not good. They made it in peanuts and when I called they said to come back and they would make another. When I got there they refused to make another and gave me a cup of cashews and told me to pick out the peanuts. When I said it wasn't good they said plenty of people order it. I will never be back. That's no way to earn my business."}
{"text":"We have ordered from this restaurant for years. Very consistent. Timely delivery and great standard take out Chinese food. The steamed pot stickers are very good as they are not the real doughy ones. I usually get the shrimp with broccoli and the kids love the Chicken Lo-Mein."}
{"text":"Maybe two stars is a bit harsh, considering how much I have ordered delivery from here. Only because they are the only Chinese delivery place in the lake, literally. I have never ordered here at dinner, because I don't particularly care for their food. At lunch, their combo includes an egg roll or wonton soup, fried rice and your protein for $5! It's so convenient and cheap, it's the one thing my coworkers have suggested to me food wise, ever.   I started out by trying my go-to china fav, Hunan chicken. I didn't like it. Then, the chicken curry. It was kind of bland, definitely didn't taste anything like any curry I have ever had. Then I tried the garlic chicken, which is when I decided I don't like the quality of their chicken. Decided to try their veggie egg foo young. This is what I order from all the China restaurants when they have 'grizzle chicken.' It satisfies, I order this now whenever I join in on a coworkers order.   The egg rolls are good. I order these quite often actually. Whenever a coworker asks if I want Chinese, 'just an egg roll.' The wonton soup is pretty good too. The crab Rangoon is good, but I have never met a crab Rangoon I don't like. I don't like their meat on a stick. I'm really picky about my meat. So much so that if I ever have some meat from a place with an off texture, I can be a bit harsh.   The delivery is fast, the customer service is nice, they have never messed up an order. I feel bad, I'm giving them 3 stars for a $5 lunch. At that price point, they deserve it."}
{"text":"Went here twice; figuring they can't get it that wrong a second time; they did. Egg drop soup was ordered; it became Hot and Sour Soup; the smell was like ammonia. Sweet and Sour chicken was correctly packaged but was really mediocre. Crab Rangoon ordered; unpacked it and it was a second carton of chicken 'fingers'. Last time the same thing happened. I was tired and hungry and didn't check the order in the restaurant. If you DO go here; check before you leave. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out here pretty often over the past year. I order by phone and the quoted wait time is never longer than 15 minutes. Prices are on par with similar restaurants. The food is always delicious (but I always get one of two things sweet and sour chicken or orange chicken) and the portions large enough for me to have leftovers without fail. Sometimes the chicken is fried too hard but most of the time it's not. Other than that my only real complaint is their ever shrinking spring rolls. They used to be quite large but over the past few months have gotten smaller and smaller (and very near burned on several occasions) to the point I don't order them anymore. (If you want to know where to get the best spring rolls in town see my other reviews.)   You can dine in here but they only have a few tables since the restaurant itself is rather small and one table is always occupied by the owners children (once school is out) although they are quite well behaved. So don't expect to get a table in a far corner for privacy or catching up with a friend."}
{"text":"I like it, Moo goo gai pan w steam rice good deal, not the best ever but good"}
{"text":"They have the best eggs rolls around! Fried extra crispy and they are larger than average. They also have the fastest delivery, they usually say 45 mins, but it'll be there in 30. Their Hunan Chix is awesome, tons of vegetables and chicken. Love the sweet n sour chix too. You get a lot for your $$"}
{"text":"*Possible change in ownership?*  I use to order from this establishment religiously. Suddenly, the food is different, the prices increased significantly and the portions decreased dramatically. They now use small plastic containers and only fill them halfway. Out of curiosity, I measured them and they equaled half a pint, NOT a pint. When I called to inquire they yelled over me in a foreign language. They refused to resolve the situation.  Also, the taste has changed. Teriyaki beef sticks are rubbery and impossible to chew. The egg rolls are cabbage-only filled and greasy. The \"pork fried rice\" had 2 small pieces of pork. Any meat + Chinese vegetable dish was predominantly onion and on average 4 pieces of meat.   Sadly, this restaurant has gone downhill and is NOT worth the money."}
{"text":"ugh.  Flavorless 9unless you count the odd smokiness in the lo mein or the fishy tasting kung po chicken).  I am usually pretty open minded when it comes to take out chinese, but this was bad."}
{"text":"Regular storefront Chinese but they deliver, worth an extra star from me. Seriously, the food is pretty good compared to similar places especially the classic dishes like sesame, orange, or sweet and sour. Egg rolls are still crispy when they arrive and the dumplings are ok. And did I mention that they deliver?"}
{"text":"New to the area, Excellent Chinese food and the best prices I have seen for Chinese takeout!"}
{"text":"I was starving and in the mood for Chinese food. No 1 Chinese Restuarant is about 5mins away from work. First time going. I called in my order for carry-over, got L5 vegetable egg foo young (it came with fried rice and egg roll) and fried wontons. Picked up my food 20mins later. There were three other people picking up their orders. The egg foo young and fried rice were fine, very greasy. The wontons were disappointing, I wanted cream cheese wonton but they were meat ones. I should have asked. It was not awful but I doubt I'll go again."}
{"text":"My husband and I order from here almost every week. He usually gets wonton soup, and either shrimp fried rice or sesame chicken. I typically order shrimp mei fun. Their prices are reasonable, and they do deliver if you are nearby. (Fyi, delivery time is usually \"45 mins\" but we typically wait for well over an hour.) But that being said, we usually just go pick it up since it's right down the street. It's not the best Chinese I've ever had, but it's pretty decent and we enjoy it.  Most recently I tried the 'seafood combination,' which is my typical go to dish at Chinese restaurants. I initially held off from ordering it from here because I was honestly nervous about the quality, but I was pretty surprised at how fresh it was! There were several large shrimp, lots of imitation crab meat, a large chunk of lobster, and several thinly sliced scallops, which was different and good. It had crisp, (thankfully not soggy) vegetables including broccoli, carrots, water chestnuts, celery, and green pepper. I'm personally not a fan of green pepper or celery, and they're not typically in this type of dish, so I did pick those out, and would ask for them to be left off next time. However I thought the crisp selection of veggies, and variety of seafood in the dish was good. They also put a very reasonable amount of sauce. Some places drench it in sauce to fill up the container, but they didn't. It was actually a perfect veggie/seafood/sauce ratio. I didn't feel sick or gross afterwards either. I'll definitely order this again."}
