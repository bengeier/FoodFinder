{"text":"Small little place that serves a combination of Chinese and Vietnamese food.  The menu is pretty limited but I tried the beef pho and the chicken and snow peas dish.  The pho had good flavor although the bean sprouts, jalapenos, etc were not brought out until I had eaten for 5 minutes.  The chicken dish was a little more disappointing since it had very little flavor and the portions were quite small.  The staff was friendly and the prices were decent, but the food was pretty average."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced, and amazing service!  They went above and beyond to ensure we had a fantastic experience and you could tell by their conversations with other patrons that they have a group of regulars that come in.  I had the teriyaki chicken and although it was a little more sweet than I would have preferred, it was a fantastic dinner all around.  I will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They are the sweetest most kind people too- Chenny is a doll. I love their beef teriyaki- their rice is the sticky rice, sooo good!!! Cannot wait to try the Pho!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with great customer service. The food is great and also the prices are cheap. The owner is a very friendly, nice, cook. He came to our table and talked to us. We came here and we ordered 5 plates. Orange Chicken, Pho Beef Soup, Wonton Soup, Dumplings aka pot Sticker, and a personal favorite House Fried Rice. Ee recommend it as a neat and organized restaurant that serves great food."}
{"text":"best spicy beef soup I've found in Arizona amazing bun bo huen going to come back soon"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We came based on other Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. The pho was excellent. Good rich hearty broth. Very tasty. The owner, we think she's the owner, was a delight. We will definitely return and will tell all of our friends. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great Pho, awesome spring rolls and the curry chicken was memorable!  Did not care for the Tom Yum but maybe it was more authentic than I am accustomed to, too fishy for me. Very friendly!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken pho and we were not a fan. The broth was not clear and it did not taste like your traditional pho. Same with the pad Thai. It was too spicy even though we asked for no spice. And our kids couldn't eat it unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for the first time with my boyfriend and I'm so glad I did! The fried rice was amazing (I'm a huge fried rice snob) and perfectly satisfied my craving! If you check in while you're there you get a free order of veggie egg rolls and those were also very delicious! The pot stickers no surprise too were great. They were crispy, decent sized, and filled with a decent amount of meat. Very impressed and will definitely be back. Not to mention everyone was so nice and made it feel like we were at a family members house or something! An overall great visit :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Owners are great and the place is kids friendly. Our family favorites are beef pho, orange chicken and beef pan fried noodle. They have a sister restaurant called Simi's Cafe, which is also wonderful. But this one is closer to us, so I hope they continue to keep it open."}
{"text":"Everything from here is good! The restaurant itself is nicely decorated with a great ambiance. Family run and the owners really take pride in their art. Five stars."}
{"text":"My husband works in the barbershop in the same shopping center, and his boss told me to try this place out for lunch. The absolute cutest lady in the world works in the front.everyone that works there so nice, they found out I had two babies in the car so they brought me the menu outside took my order outside, came to the door took my debit card charged me all within having to go into the restaurant. So of course the next time we were in the mood for something, I told my mom and sister about it we all ordered and everything was delicious. I love the veggie spring rolls."}
{"text":"I have had mad cravings for Pho in the past month or so and just happened to see this little spot in the back of the shopping complex with a big sign that said PHO! My wife and I decided to check it out and what a great find it was! 

It's a small, quaint little place with the nicest staff you will meet. We sat right away, had nice conversation with the woman at the front who I assume is the owner. She seemed to be friends with everyone that came in, and her customer service was top notch! She even went to the extent of carrying takeout to a patrons car for them! 

My wife got chicken teriyaki which looked very fresh. She said it was pretty good. I had the Beef Pho which was perfect to fill my month long craving. The broth had good flavor which is the key to Pho in my opinion. 

I'm fortunate enough to have this little spot right around the corner and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Such yummy food at a fantastic price. The waitstaff are so accommodating and friendly. I had the pho for the first time and it was delish. Great flavor, not too salty. Our experience was so good we came back a day later to try something new. Equally as delish. Must try the spring rolls!!!"}
{"text":"Went into this place today with my parents who had never had pho. First time to this restaurant, and we all really enjoyed our food. The pho was excellent (I had the #20 with beef), broth was very well seasoned and not too salty. My dad had the #25, a spicy soup that was also light and broth-centered, but different than pho. It was also excellent. 
What really made this spot stand out was the owners-they were so sweet and friendly. The cook came out and made sure our food was to our satisfaction, and made sure we got what we wanted as far as the order. 
They were very attentive and really seemed to care about our experience. We will be going back there again very soon. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Soup is definitely their specialty! 

Their broth is made from scratch & you can taste it. The staff is very personable and willing to answer all questions, give recommendations, and even tell you how the food is made... their passion for their product can be seen in their eyes!

The meat balls and wontons have a great taste to them, they were cooked in a good broth!

I want to come back and try their lemon chicken salad!!!"}
{"text":"A great place, love the pho here, also the service too. This is the closest pho place I can get in east Gilbert. Glad I found it. Came here a lot, their pho really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Great people and excellent food! Even treated me to free chicken wings on the house!!"}
{"text":"Pho was fantastic. I got the spicy beef and didn't leave one bit of the broth.  I like the fact that when they say spicy it is. Not overly I thought perfect.  My son who is 3 did a number on the chicken chow mein. Will be going back for sure.  Also, super friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and dinner. Was in town visiting my family and had a craving for pho. Fabulous service and fabulous pho! The broth here is amazing, probably the best I've ever had. Super delicious, not too salty or greasy, and the meatballs were delicious.

Highly recommend the won ton soup, as well as the bo bun hue. Get the fried tofu appetizer, it comes with more than enough to share."}
{"text":"Nice little family owned restaurant. Very clean. It quiet environment good for visiting. I always enjoy the food here."}
{"text":"The best Pho I've had since I left Washington in 2012. And quite possibly the best customer service I've had since ever! This is my new go-to spot for a satisfying meal and for some grandmotherly love."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! The food isn't your traditional orange and lemon chicken, the have thise, but they cook them so much better here! The lemon chicken has a light sauce and the batter it's crispy deliciousness. The orange chicken isn't the puffy kind, but it's even better. The owners are lovely people and always remember me and ask about my family. So happy to have this gem here!"}
{"text":"Place is really clean, friendly service and food is great. definitely making this my go to Vietnamese. So happy I found this place. 

The grilled pork salad is delicious !"}
{"text":"amazing ! customer service is wonderful, a nice mom and pop place to go support. i'm so happy they opened a vietnamese food place nearby where i live :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Tried the pho here tonight for the first time and we will definitely be back! Delicious, hot, and fresh! I had the chicken pho and my hubs had the special combination pho (#19). The restaurant is clean and nicely designed. The staff is very friendly and treated us like family, especially our baby! We will definitely be regulars here. Only suggestion to the restaurant is to add more items to the menu since you're obviously so talented!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there today with my family and it's our first time.  The owners were so warm and friendly and treated us like they've known us forever.  Service was excellent and the food phenomenal.  The wontons, orange chicken, and Pho were all delicious.  My son-in-law said that was the best orange chicken he's had since moving out from Cali years ago.

We'd give the Pepper Cafe 10 stars if we could.  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in town. Service is impeccable, you are treated like family from the moment you walk in. Thank god I live next door! I come here weekly now!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I love the staff; the woman who takes our order is always so sweet and friendly. The food is truly authentic, from the pho to the Vietnamese pork egg/spring rolls and dishes over rice. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for splendid, authentic Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while my car was in the shop and ordered Chicken Pad Thai. Overall I enjoyed the meal, but could have used more options with spicy levels.  Service was amazing and everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"Hello there! I'm eating my pho right now and it's AMAZING! If you want pho definitely come to this place!"}
{"text":"The Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup) was the worst food/dish I've had for a year.

The noodles were severely overcooked, I was not able to use chopsticks to pick up the noodles because they would break apart as I pick the noodles up. The broth was spicy and salty. That's it; there was no depth of flavor I expect from a bun bo hue. There was no pork feet either, as one should expect from a bun bo hue. 

I do not understand people who praise the bun bo hue here. Maybe I came on a bad night. Nonetheless, it was a terrible meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The owner Albert is a cool guy. The food is delicious and great comfortable place to eat. Would recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"You guys, I seriously love this place! Boyfriend and I were craving pho and this place had the best reviews nearby so we checked it out. The reviews are right! The food is DELICIOUS, the place is super clean and the staff is so wonderfully sweet. Since our first visit, I think we've been back about once a week. The lady server (owner? I need to learn her name, she's amazing) even remembered us AND our order when we were there last night! Please come and support this local business so they stay around forever"}
{"text":"Always looking for a new Pho spot. This one opened not long ago. It's very clean, the owners and staff are very friendly and very proud of the Pho broth. The owner took me through the process of making Pho and let me tell you it's gotta be a labor of love. Glad someone does it. This one in particular is delicious with a deep natural flavor of beef bone, onion and ginger. I'll be back often to have this delectable bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"Great place... great atmosphere... great pho. It's a simple menu, for once. I kind of liked it too."}
{"text":"Bun bo hue was very tasty!! Chicken pho had a very clean flavor with veggies in it! Definitely going back for the food and the service. Very friendly staff! Say hi to Chinny, she's a sweet lady."}
{"text":"Omg!!! This is by far one of my favorite restaurants!! I have never really liked or enjoyed any orange chicken from anywhere but this place has the BEST orange chicken! It's so delicious and fresh. It sort of melts in your mouth. My mouth waters anytime i think about it. I have tried a handful of their dishes and all of them have been exceptional! I always end up craving their orange chicken though. The employees there are so nice. I also have to mention their prices are so affordable. I'm so happy I found this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Spicy Beef is the best pho I have ever had in Arizona ... something I will constantly crave from here on out 

Potstickers: nothing special 

Kung pao:
Good not the best or way above average but really good - not spicy so request more heat if you want a kick."}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but was super excited to order tofu pad Thai. When I opened it up there wasn't much at all and instead of tofu cooked in the pad Thai it was just huge chunks of tofu that were very dry. The noodles didn't taste like normal of Thai (I have had it a million times). It tastes more like mooshoo noodles. I had to add plum sauce which still didn't taste that good. We did get free egg rolls due to the Yelp advertisement and that was really good. Pretty dissapointed since
I was craving it."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Very nice and friendly staff. I appreciate the cleanliness of the whole place and I can tell they take pride in their work. However, I am ultimately there for the food and I was let down. I am a huge Pho fanatic and I've eaten at plenty enough places to know that this place had way to much broth and was very skimpy with their beef. The beef was sliced extremely thin, to the point it shriveled up, and I only had three tiny pieces. That's a shame for a 10$ bowl of Pho. The potstickers were ok, nothing to write home about. Overall, if this was the only place in the area I'd probably go to it. But because there are plenty of other places nearby I will be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The orange chicken is fantastic and the customer service was top notch. We were one of two tables as it was later in the evening. The portions are insanely big. Had a lot for leftovers."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! the staff is incredible and always make us feel so welcome. The soup is fantastic and very authentic.  Just discovered this place about a week ago and have already been twice since then! Try this place if you love Vietnamese food"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!!! You have to try the spicy beef soup. Without a doubt the best Vietnamese food around!!
I mean it... The Pho King Best!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and great staff. The noodles were good and just as great as the food in San Diego. Yum!"}
{"text":"Delicious broth flavor! The chicken is my favorite but hubby swears the spicy beef was better. The spring tools & veggie rolls were flavorful as well. 
Very clean establishment! Owners we're delightful."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. Incredible service. The family members that run this establishment are so genuine and friendly. Now on to the food. My mom and I love Pho and eat it regularly. The Pho was delicious. The orange chicken and the crab puffs were beyond delicious. But oh my... the fried rice!! Took a while to come out but so worth the wait. Seriously best rice I've ever eaten. So moist and fresh. Husband say's best orange chicken he's had in AZ. Big thumbs up and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and super sweet service. Their pho has some of the best broth I've had in the east valley's pho options. I can't wait to try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"The vegetable mushroom pho was great! The staff is very friendly and provided great service. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and the restaurant looks nice inside and clean. Their pho is really good but I've had better. The beef chow mein is stellar! The best I've ever had! Their orange chicken is also delicious! The sauce on the Asian short ribs is super delicious but the ribs themselves were a bit tough and chewy. Overall I highly recommend this place for the beef chow mein and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time.  WOW!  It was SOOO yummy!!  The Vietnamese Pork Egg Rolls are delicious and the dipping sauce has an amazing \"zing\" to it.  The potstickers are crisp with another delicious sauce.  My spicy beef noodle soup was SUPER delicious!  I like spicy food, but didn't find it to be overly spicy...just right.  My Hubby's House Pho was flavorful as well.  You can tell they put time and love into the broth.  The service was fast and friendly.  We will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"A flag beside the road that simply said \"Pho\" was my only clue that Gilbert had a new restaurant. It is located directly South of House of Brews, about three doors down on the end. It's a small mom and pop operation that has been open for a month.

I had the special Beef Pho that featured several different meats. My wife and father in law both ordered chicken Pho. We also ordered spring rolls and fried tofu.

The service was fast and friendly. The dining area is neat and clean. The pho was served in double walled bowls that made it easier to position them on the table. They were also large. I ate all the good stuff and about half my noodles before tapping out. The chicken pho had lots of white meat and a delicious broth. My companions ate about half before asking for doggy bags to take home the rest.

The spring rolls were large, freshly made, and served with a tasty vinagarette. The fried tofu was the best we've had ever. The outside was lightly breaded, maybe just floured, and fried to a golden brown. The crispy surface contrasted with a silky smooth inside. We had to doggy bag about half the order as I think they must have used a whole container of tofu.

Prices were very reasonable. It came to less than $12 each excluding tip. We plan to eat there weekly."}
{"text":"This place is clean, friendly and fresh. 
We ordered plate 22 to go (pho) and spring rolls
Amazing and tasty food. 
This place is hidden but worth every bite. 
Prices are reasonable 
Staff is helpful"}
{"text":"We just dropped off our daughter at a birthday party and looked for \"Pho\" near us from the ice skate rink.
We decided to try this place and are glad we did! Excellent food & service. 
My wife & I both ordered the \"chicken noodle soup\", which, is the \"pho\" we hoped to find.
The soup was loaded with veggies,including bokchoy, which was delicious. 
We will definitely eat here again :)"}
{"text":"Walked in and the environment seem very welcoming already. Restaurant was very clean, spotless, and very modern. 

We order fried tofu for appetizer and it came out just fine. Although the sauce that came with it was not our favorite, the tofu taste better with the sweet fish sauce or just plain soy sauce. Their wonton soup was very good and the actual wonton was delicious! Soup was savory but their was a little too much fat on top of the soup. 

I would definitely be back to try other dishes they have."}
{"text":"Great find. We had the lemongrass salad with chicken, the pepper chicken and spring rolls. Fresh ingredients, made to order and full of authentic flavor. Service was top notch, the owner came out and explained dishes and gave recommendations. We'll def be back!"}
{"text":"The Pepper Cafe was just OK in terms of the food and the general atmosphere.  The people were friendly enough and did not mind making a custom order for one of my kids, so we appreciated that.  Two of us had the Pho Tai and it was not bad, but not great; no separate dishes for mixing sauces and a little light on the added fixings.  The Won Ton soup was a little bland and an unusual mix of both shrimp and pork.  The pork egg rolls had little to no vegetables in them and seemed pretty dense somehow.  My kids liked the pot stickers.  Overall OK but I have had enough better Pho in town that we are not likely to return."}
{"text":"The serving per dish is ample we had the chicken
Pad thai which is good. The teriyaki chicken was good. We also had the crab puffs which is ok.
The pho tai (beef soup) tasted like instant soup broth and needs more beef slices. The taste is far from the original vietnamese style."}
{"text":"We had the pho here, the soup was just OK. I wanted to like this place because it was so close to my house. They use lemon wedges instead of lime like all other places do so I am not sure if they are authentic. 

On the other hand, the fried egg rolls are pretty good. But not enough for me to return."}
{"text":"Fast service, great pho, cute name. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I have been here for a couple of times, but they have blown my mind in every single way. I ordered Pho Dac Biet and my company got the Pho Ga.
- presentation: side dishes are perfectly presented, with bean sprout, basils, some slides of jalapeño and lime.
-  size and portion: good enough to fill you up. They use the thermal bowls, which helps to keep the broth hot at all time.
- taste: flavorful, delicious.
- decoration: the cafe ground is always clean.
- bathroom: many stocked up goods and they take care of it pretty well, no diaper changing area.
- customer service: very friendly, family style.

I will try something else next time besides the soup."}
{"text":"Finally a great place to get great food next to home and work. Amazingly fresh food. This place is worth trying. Admittedly, I drove past this place for a long long time without ever knowing it was there. It was only by chance I saw it out of the corner of my eye and then looked it up.

Hoping they can get enough business to stay open. Maybe they can put some signs out on the main intersection nearby or something. I don't think many know it is there."}
{"text":"Went in thinking it was a Vietnamese restaurant,  while they do serve Pho the rest is Chinese food.   I will be back to order the pho when it's not 118 degrees out.   I will speak on the service and food,  again it was standard Chinese teriyaki this and sweet and sour that. I had the mixed teriyaki it was good not spectacular but good,  the crab puffs and spring roll were The bomb!!  The service was decent no complaints there only 4 stars not 5 because it's listed as Vietnamese but really isn't dedicated like most listed in that category"}
{"text":"BEST pho I have ever had! The broth is perfect and makes the soup! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit, but we will be regulars from now on.  The staff is very nice and the food is fantastic.  We tried Calamari and Peppers, Crab Puffs, Tom Yum, Mongolian Beef and House Fried Rice and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"This tasted so good! Every time I leave I miss am so exited to be hungry again so I can go back! The owners are really cute and I miss them all the time I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a great Thai place to take my friend for his birthday. It was really good! We got crispy tofu (great!), vegetable and pork egg rolls (oh my!), pho (it's off the chain!), seafood soup (very spicy), orange chicken (perfect), and chicken rice noodle soup (loved it). I will totally be back here! The service was great and atmosphere is very relax. If you go, get the Thai tea!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and even better service. Such nice people running the place. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time at Pepper Café, will definitely return.  Everything we ordered was great as was the customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Great vietnamese food, soo glad they finally opened one up in gilbert, great prices, great quality food, and I didn't wait long for my food to come when I ordered it. I loved it soo much I ate here twice in one day."}
{"text":"My husband and I searched a recent email from Yelp about hot and new places near us. We landed here and Wow everything was great! I appreciate that you can have chicken broth instead of beef broth for pho. We shared a chicken chow mein and were very impressed. I had the shrimp pho and my husband had the spicy beef soup. Go go go to this place, you will enjoy everything."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and after reading the great reciews had high hopes. My husband's pho only had four tiny pieces of beef a.d he said broth tasted like it was just beef broth from a can. My broth was very bland and I had to really spice it up. If we're in the area we might give them another try. Haven't found a Pho place that comes close to our favorite spot in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Out here from the west side for a dance competition so my son and I snuck out to get some Pho. This place is fantastic. I had the beef brisket and the broth was incredible. A spicy sweet flavor that really complemented the ingredients of beef, noodles, onions and even the mint and jalepenos.  He had the beef and said it was his favorite to date as well. We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly. Everything was ready in 10 minutes for pick up. Chicken Pho is really good and the crab puffs are delicious, so much that they were out of them the last time I ordered! High demamd! Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"1st time here and we had great service and delicious food To-Go. My Husband tried the orange chicken and loved it. The spicy beef soup was great too! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pho Tai was really good! The broth is very favorable. Servers were so nice they let me have a small bowl to share with my five year old. New favorite spot"}
{"text":"So far this place has been great. The pho is good and it's staff are pretty accommodating."}
{"text":"Not enough stars to rate this awesome place.  The owner is so kind and genuine. Wonderful service and delicious food that will not disappoint. Seafood soup was great, pho was great and so was the orange chicken. Come support this clean, friendly local cafe. So worth it!"}
{"text":"I work next to this place and find myself eating here at least once a week. They are a small family run joint with fresh food made from scratch.  I love the orange chicken, pho, and salads. The owners are always there to make sure the food is fresh and the customers are satisfied. I recommend this place to all our customers anytime the ask us what good to eat in the area."}
{"text":"This review is really only for the pho and customer service as that is all we had. By far one of the best bowls of pho that we have had. The flavor of the broth is on point which is key to a good pho. We showed up with about 30 min to close and they were super nice and very attentive to all of our needs. Great little hidden place, we will definitely be back many more times"}
{"text":"These guys are the Pho King best! (; A sweet little gem close by the house for my pho eating delights. I recommend coming on Friday because they make these special sweet & spicy wings that are perfectly cooked and full of flavor! 
   I could probably eat 20 orders of their Vietnamese Spring Rolls. Shrimp & pork wrapped with the freshest veggies & served with an amazing peanut sauce. The spicy beef pho is my go-to. The broth has great flavor & body, perfect spice level & the meatballs are yum yum! 
   Come try this place & you definitely won't be disappointed. The price is so good, you can try lots of different dishes without breaking the bank. And the owners are so sweet & genuine, you'll feel good supporting a local business."}
{"text":"Great food and clean. The owner is super nice! The pho here is really good and refreshing, as well as there spring rolls. The place is very clean and spacious."}
{"text":"Had the pho and the pineapple chicken fried rice both awesome the pho is really good only complaint would be more meat but the Broth was good metal bowls keep broth hot owner was nice ! West valley is pho 43 and east valley is Pepper cafe and pho Vietnam ! Keep up the good tasting food guys"}
{"text":"We drive out of our way to get pho from Pepper Cafe. It is SO good! 
This restaurant is clean, and the owners are so sweet.

Best PHO in town!"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot to grab some great pho. I live in Ahwatukee but travel out to Gilbert to get a great meal. Haven't ordered anything that I didn't like so far!"}
{"text":"It's quaint quiet restaurant with a very clean kitchen. It's great place for carry out or dine in. The panang was very good and the orange chicken is phenomenal. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I am super obsessed with spring rolls and have had them from just about every Vietnamese restaurant near me. I tried this place a couple weeks ago and the rolls were thin and small and the sauce just didn't taste right. I also had the beef Pho which was good but I would rather go elsewhere for my cravings."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and the prices are very reasonable. I'm surprised its not as busy, especially on a Saturday night. I am glad I found this place, as this place is the closest pho restaurant to where I live. I will definitely come here again:)"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for pho to go. Got to talk the owner. The food was excellent. We look forward to eating at the restaurant. The spring rolls and egg rolls were great. We rate it 5 stars. Happy New Year. With this food and service it will definitely be a great 2017."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that the service is amazing, very clean and the food is second to none.  This restaurant is run with pride and they make you feel welcome every time. There are not many restaurants like this one in the valley. I do highly recommend. Albert takes care of his customers."}
{"text":"We just tried Pepper Cafe for the first time, and it was great!  We ordered the pork egg rolls, crab puffs and two kinds of pho. The prices are very reasonable, and we took home leftovers. All of the food was fresh and delicious. We felt like we walked into their home and enjoyed a family meal.  The broth for the pho had so much depth; it's the real deal. They have fish sauce and chili paste on the side so you can customize your spice level. To top it off, the owners were beyond friendly and take great pride in their food and restaurant (it was spotless).  The egg rolls were perfectly crispy, not the least bit oily, and come with mint and lettuce for wrapping. If one doesn't know about pho or any item on the menu, the owners are happy to share details. The owner said they opened in April, and I hope everyone supports this local, family-owned gem."}
{"text":"Great find! This place used to be a burger joint, but new owners took over and turned it into a Asian spot. Have not tried the pho yet. 

I had the orange chicken and pork egg roles. I like my stuff extra spicy and they definitely delivered. It was the right amount of spice and tasted really good. It came with a spring roll and a ragoon for only $6.50. That is a killer deal. 

The staff was very friendly And went above and beyond. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Looked up pho places nearby and pepper cafe popped up so decided to give them a try. Came in and saw them advertising Thai tea for $2.75 so I requested a Thai tea to go but they didn't have any...ok...that's a minus...I read their yelp ratings and noticed a lot of raving for their pho so ok, let order pho! Over all the pho was ok -- I would give it a 3.5 star for pho. The broth isn't the best but I liked how they serve in a metal bowl which allows the pho to be hot longer. I'll definitely try this place again and will see what else is there to order."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and the owners are so sweet. I highly recommend the basil chicken. Yum! The place is super clean and the food is fresh and made just as you like. I don't handle spicy food well, so they always accommodate me with a perfectly mild dish."}
{"text":"This place just opened up, it use to be called Bings burgers. It's called Pepper Cafe which serves Vietnamese pho' and Asian food, we ordered fried tofu for appetizer and chicken pho' which was really good broth, we also ordered sweet and sour pork dish / chicken teriyaki dish. Good stuff, if your in the area for pho' give this place a try! Good prices and service. Chinny served us and was the owner too, very nice lady!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Asian restaurant. The owner is awesome and seems like such a genuine person. He came and checked on us to make sure the food was perfect. We got the orange chicken and it was perfection. Must try."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here based on the reviews and we were not disappointed!  The food was excellent!  I had the shrimp chow mein and my husband  had orange chicken.   We also ordered fried rice.  Chicken chow mein was my favorite but everything was very good!  Definitely one of our favorite restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I don't profess to be a Pho expert, but I have had some pretty dang good Pho before. Pepper Cafe did not meet the mark. I ordered the Pho with Shrimp. The broth to noodles and shrimp ratio seemed really off to me. It was more broth than anything. The broth was decent tasting. The noodles were mediocre at best. They were on the soggy side. The Shrimp was next to horrible. It was the worst shrimp I remember having...ever. I also ordered some Veggie Egg Rolls which I got for free as a check-in offer. And I'm glad they were free. They were horrible. The outside shell was overdone, and the insides were a mushy mess. 

I love to support locally owned and operated businesses, but sadly I cannot give a recommendation here."}
{"text":"Just amazing. We had the shrimp pineapple chicken fried rice and chicken noodle pdo with baby bok choy"}
{"text":"Had Pepper Cafe for the first time tonight and ordered take out. The Pho was delicious and the service was outstanding. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is great (so fresh), the service is quick, and the staff is really friendly. Great place for take-out! I call in lunch for pick up almost weekly. Some of my favorites are the orange chicken (I can confidently say it's my favorite orange chicken ever!) and the garlic chicken. I always top it off with an order of veggie egg rolls (which if you check in you get for free!!)"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice this week and am so glad I found it! Service is great, clean beyond belief and the food is fantastic. Kind of tucked out of the way but worth finding."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. The service is always very friendly and pleasant. Today the woman serving me offered to give me additional rice complementary. I highly recommend Pepper Cafe!"}
{"text":"I have never wrote a yelp review however,I felt it very necessary after coming to Pepper Cafe. Albert the owner is personable, friendly, inviting and all other warm and fuzzy adjectives one can think of. There aren't many places in Gilbert where you can get solid Pho which is why I am so thrilled I found this place. The Pho Thai and the Vietnamese spring rolls are awesome! The broth in the pho is tasty, homemade and hot.  It's clean, simple but the food is legit and the service is even better. We will be back. Again and Again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service, one of my favorite places to go for Vietnamese food. The Tom Yum seafood soup is the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"This place is clean and very friendly.  The food is delicious and the veggies in everything they make are so fresh.  I am a regular customer and so happy it's close to home."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time. Went with a couple of co-workers for lunch. I got the orange chicken which was delicious. Co-workers got beef pho and kim chi soup and they absolutely loved it. Our food came super fast and the staff are very nice. I can't wait to go back to try the Asian ribs!"}
{"text":"YUMMMM!!! What a cute little place and such nice service. Ok now the food. So much flavor in everything and I echo another's review that the sauces are made from scratch. We had the beef Pho and the teriyaki chicken. Both were heavenly. So glad this is down the street from us!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, I suppose, but the beef pho was a bit bland and lacked color... I would've liked to have seen some veggies in there, rather than just a few pieces of beef, broth, and noodles.  The orange chicken was plentiful and had a pretty good flavor. It had a bit more breading than I prefer, but the kids liked it. My wife got a salad with chicken and it was very good."}
{"text":"All I have to say is the \"PANANG IS FANTASTIC!\" Food is always consistantly awesome.  Staff is friendly.  A must eatery for the valley."}
{"text":"This place was fan-TAS-tic!!!!

We drove by earlier and my girlfriend said:  \"HEY! Pho!!!\" We drove by to check it out... a place that I never much cared for had been replaced by a brand new Pho joint. Oh, happy day indeed!!! So we stopped in for a late lunch, and boy were we pleasantly surprised!!!

First off, let me just preface by saying that the only reason this place didn't get five stars right off the bat is because they don't have Soda Xi Muoi or Vietnamese coffee. I can't, in good conscience, give five stars to any Vietnamese restaurant that doesn't serve those two items. It's non-negotiable. However, their food was straight-up five star fare, so if you don't care about salty plum soda or coffee with condensed milk, then consider this a five-star rating!!!

We ordered the spring rolls to start with, and I can honestly say that I was very pleasantly surprised!!! Not only were they quite large, but they were packed with ingredients! They had grilled pork, shrimp, vermincelli, and mint, and they really hit the spot!!!! I ordered the bun bo hue, and my partner in crime ordered the pho dac biet. Both were not only excellent, they were exceptional. When I ordered the bun bo hue, the chef asked if I wanted pig's foot. A hearty \"HEEEEEEEELL MUTHAFUCKIN' YES!\" escaped my lips before I could even check myself. The soups came out, and they just looked divine right from the get-go. Big ol' globs of collagen danced on top of the broth (that's not grease, kids- that's *GOODNESS*), and both soups just *assailed* you with their flavours. The broth is *right*, son. The pig's foot was outstanding, and if you've never tried that before then I can't recommend it enough. You've never had pork fall off of a bone quite like that before. The bun bo hue was just the right amount of spicy, and the pho was beefy and hearty. Both soups were definitely some of the best I've ever had, and along with the knockout rolls I can honestly say that I'm extremely impressed with this place.

The owners seemed extremely friendly! Now, if they'll only read this review and add those two items, they'll have five stars in no time... *hint hint!!*"}
{"text":"Pepper Cafe is fantastic! I brought some of their food home for my husband and roommate and they both declared that it was some of the best they'd ever tried. On top of this they were so friendly and they made triply sure my order was right. We're so hooked on them now and I've been recommending them to my friends."}
{"text":"So far my favorite Vietnamese place. I recently visited Vietnam and this definitely seems the most authentic. I was extra impressed that they use soy sauce that doesn't have wheat in it. Apparently putting wheat in soy sauce is an American thing and they get soy sauce that is authentic to Vietnam."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I've eaten here several times now (I've kind of overdosed on Pepper Cafe in the week since I've first tried it). To sum it up simply: this place is a GEM. The owners, the food, everything is just absolutely delicious. Even their Steamed White Rice is fantastic...I mean, c'mon!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Pho tastes excellent.  Orange chicken is a must.  House fried rice has tons of great flavors and plenty of proteins.  Fried Calamari comes with jalapeños, yum.  Beef Short ribs have a great flavor.  If they are available, chicken wings are unbelievably good."}
{"text":"It is hard to find quality chicken at fast food Asian restaurants nowadays. Not only does this place have quality chicken but it's sauces are  NOT thickened with copious amounts of cornstarch like some other places. Fluffy rice, perfectly cooked veggies(not over cooked or under cooked), tender meat and an amazing spring role to top it all off! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Pho, takes over 10 hours to prepare the broth. Customer service is spot on. You actually get a refill lol. Very clean."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since they opened. Finally made it here on the perfect rainy day for pho. We had the number 22 pho special... yummmmm lots of flavor. We also had the number 2 spring rolls. I love that they were fresh and not taken out of the fridge like it's been in there for a few hours. Portions were perfect and I loved that it felt like I was eating at my moms. ;) definitely will be returning soon cause I love me some good pho."}
{"text":"Best pho soup ever! Great portions, great service and good prices. Definitely one of my new favorite places!"}
{"text":"Came here and tried the beef pho, very delicious and would definitely come back again. The service was very welcoming and good. The prices are just right. The beef pho came with bean sprouts and a slice of lemon on the side. I also ordered an iced tea and they gave me a can of Arizona Green Tea with a large cup of ice which I thought was cool."}
{"text":"Just stopped by because the the guys at O'Reilly recommended this place.  Holly cow this place is Amazing! The staff is very friendly and they help you with any questions about the menu. I ordered the Thai basil chicken and it was so good. So much flavor, I can taste each vegetable a sauce just everything is so good. I will definitely be back so I can try more items from the menu. Definitely want to try the soup since it looks amazing."}
{"text":"Their spicy beef soup Is HANDS DOWN the best I have had in Phoenix since I moved here 12 years ago. I have also had their pho Tai and it as well was killer! I absolutely love the food here. The soup came in a massive container as well, you can definitely consider this two servings. 
I ordered the orange chicken for my kids and it's not the traditional plate you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. It's served over plain white rice and the chicken pieces are flat and pretty crispy, still delicious but not your typical orange chicken. I love how it's tucked back in the plaza so it definitely feels like a hidden gem"}
{"text":"So we found this place Saturday and have been in 3 times already. The pho is excellent with delicious ingredients and not too salty like other places. The spring rolls are some of the best I've ever had. They also have a good selection of non-pho, I had the teriyaki vegetables and it was also excellent and the vegetables were fresh. I should also add the prices are  very reasonable.
What makes this place really special are the people, we found them very eager to please us, it's so nice to go out for a meal and find the people preparing the food so intent on making sure you have a good experience. The cook came out to see how everything was and made sure we knew he could make an item a little different to match our taste. 
We're so happy they are close by!!"}
{"text":"Last week we were here at Pepper Cafe and we mentioned to Carmen that our son was turning 6 on the 13th. Well we came in tonight and after we were seated we were gifted with 4 little Chinese cakes for our son. We are always blown away by the kindness we receive here. The food is amazing and the people are so very warm, genuine and down to earth. 
If you're looking for great food and friendly service you need to come to Pepper!"}
{"text":"Good Beef Pho.

But I think they need to make a vegetable pho that is a vegetable broth, not a chicken broth."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are new to the Gilbert area, and have been trying to find a go-to place for pho. Well, we have found it at Pepper Cafe! Their spring rolls are the best I have ever had, and I am a spring roll fanatic! The pho is amazing as well. The restaurant is very unsuspecting, as it is tucked in the corner of a shopping plaza, but if you are a fan of Vietnamese food, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Felt at home at this family owned restaurant.  Service was excellent.  My wife asked for non-sweetened ice tea which they don't sell.  To accommodate her,  they brewed hot tea and then poured it over ice.

My wife and I each got spring rolls and Pho Thai.  Our daughter got pot stickers.  I personally didn't like the peanut sauce for the spring rolls.  The Pho bowls were huge, however I didn't feel that there was enough meat.  My wife and I agreed that the place we used to get Pho at on the West Side was more flavorful.

Don't get me wrong, we really liked this place.  Prices were very reasonable.  Again, the service and portions were great!"}
{"text":"The owners are amazing and so is the food. Hands down some of the best customer service. Love the spring rolls and the veggie pho!!!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for a surprise lunch date and the food was delicious.  The staff was very friend and answered all my questions. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I put ONE star because of the service. They sold the Discount on Groupon and Localflavor but when people used that the second time since they bought many vouchers, the owner lady changed her attitude. It was very unprofessional when you ask customers \"did you use the coupon last time?\" Or is it your last coupon? Hey, why did you sell that then you don't want people to use that. The limit is 5 per person, I bought 5 and my husband bought 5 since I thought it's good after the first time. However, I will return them. I didn't beg for food. They discriminated coupon users. That's why their business is very slow. Change the way to run business or it is gonna closed SOON."}
{"text":"Great pho' and the wonton soup!   Ordering out was seamless and easy.  Everything was still hot when we got home too."}
{"text":"Soup is very good. Other dishes are all lunch portions, but tasty. Service is great and owners are very friendly. Place is very clean. All combined gives this place an easy five star rating."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now.  Food is excellent and service is great too!  Appears this is a family run business. The chef came out both times there to be sure we liked our meal."}
{"text":"Everything was hot and fresh! The employees are friendly. I had the shrimp pho and it had a lot of noodles !! My fiancé had the chicken pho but was not flavorful. The shrimp fried rice was delish and my daughter got the orange chicken which was also good."}
{"text":"Great place! I really loved the vegetable pho! Highly recommend. I'll be coming back! Really great family owned restaurant"}
{"text":"My wife and I love pho and stopped into this place today. The we had chicken pho and spring rolls. The pho was very fresh, clean and tasted great. It was the first time that I had baby bok choy in pho and it was delicious. I would highly recommend. The spring rolls also had a little twist that I was not used to (standard shrimp but with beef as well) that was very, very tasty.

The owners are about as nice as you can get and the restaurant was very clean.

As a side note: This place would get 5 stars based on the food alone, but I have to give a big THANK YOU to the owner. I locked my keys in the car when we got there, but we decided to figure out what to do while we were eating lunch. The owner heard about what was going on and insisted that she call HER AAA to come out and take care of it. We declined, but she insisted saying, \"It's important for all of us to take care of each other\". Seriously? You don't come by that all too often these days. We accepted the help and within 30 minutes someone was there to unlock the car. If I could give an extra star or 5 for that, I would!"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot, only tried their dish over rice which was tasty. The vegetables and chicken are made fresh. Haven't tried their pho but will do soon. The owner is very accommodating and can make you anything you want really. Prices are fair and portions are good."}
{"text":"I love this place! Wonderful friendly staff. Great food. We gotta appreciate this place being a little slower today. When this place catches on, it's going to be wild fire! Lines going down the street!"}
{"text":"We are new to Arizona and we are now new regulars to the Pepper Cafe. We LOVE the pho (fresh and flavorful) and potstickers (never greasy and so fresh tasting). Absolutely delicious! The staff is friendly and welcoming and always remember us."}
{"text":"I saw the Pho banner on the corner of cooper and warner and got excitied. I love pho but my wife l, not so much. This is second time here for lunch on my day off to get my pho fix. 

First time was to go. Number 19, the broth was okay. But it was to go and pho doesnt do so well with that. 

The second time i ate at the resturant. So good. The couple that runs the place is awesome. Very freindly and welcoming. 

Have to check this out. There menu is posted on the facebook page."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I'm definitely a regular! I eat here almost every week or whenever i'm craving pho~ the pho isn't the most amazing in the world but it still tastes great and is very filling and delicious. The prices are perfect as well! The service is always great and speedy and I always feel taken care of! I recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why this place has 5 stars because it's not that great. Because it had 5 stars and I drove past the restaurant and saw the flag banner that said \"Pho\", I decided I had to go try and see for myself. My husband and I love pho and we've been to pretty much every Vietnamese restaurant around town. We went on a Friday afternoon around 5pm and the restaurant was completely empty. We were greeted by a lady at the front counter who I'm guessing is the owner. The inside was very clean and you can see the kitchen from the dining area because it's separated by a big window and glass. We decided to get an order of spring rolls, fried eggrolls, and 2 bowls of their combination pho. The spring rolls came out and looked very promising. They were pretty big and had meat and shrimp inside. A lot of the vietnamese restaurants use a thin slice of unseasoned pork, but this place used some sort of marinated meat which made the spring roll taste really good except for the fact that the marinade was really salty. I love salt and salty foods but the marinade on the meat was really salty. The ratio of meat, shrimp, veggie, and rice noodles inside the spring roll was on point. The eggrolls came out next the same time as our pho which I wasn't too excited about because that should have came out with the spring rolls since we ordered those as appetizers. I could tell the eggrolls were a little different than what they serve at other Vietnamese restaurants and they were a little bigger. I took a bite and the taste began to taste like what we were used to and then it kind of fell flat. The best way I can describe it was that it was like a more natural, organic version of the usual eggroll that you would get at other Vietnamese restaurants. I think there was mashed taro in there and it just wasn't what we were used to. The pho came out and the bowls are pretty big and the serving size is great! As far as the taste of the pho, it was lacking the authentic taste of pho. I think some of the typical spices used in pho like star anise and some of the other spices were really missing. The broth was really clean and light and not oily, which was nice. The meat was tender and so was the tripe, but the tendons were different and not what we were used to. I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy their food but we probably won't be back for pho just because it didn't taste like authentic pho that we're used to. Overall, good service, clean restaurant, ok food, but definitely not 5 stars in our book."}
{"text":"This is officially a new favorite hole in the wall place for me.  The pho was to die for!!! Best I've had! The broth was made from scratch and it really shows with the flavor.  I will be coming back again and again!! The hospitality  is also on point and everyone is super friendly.  Definitely A+"}
{"text":"It is definitely a noodle house. I love wonton noodle soup and this place serves a delicious bowl. They have pho and bun bo hue but its chinese so its not authentic viet spices and flavoring. We also had spring rolls eith peanut sauce and thai tea. Spring rolls are made with shrimp and bbq meat. Awesome. 

Service was quick and fast. Server was very polite. 

Total bill was under 30 for 2 people. Great spot for quick dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"WOW! Food is amazing and staff is super friendly. They skip no corners everything made on site nothing purchased. The broth made from scratch is perfect."}
{"text":"I love pho. This is the best pho I've had in a long time. The owners were very nice.  I will be back for sure with my family. Now I don't have to drive to chandler for good Vietnam food"}
{"text":"What a great place for dinner.
The owners are great and very friendly service.
We had three different meals off the menu and we all shared. Not one bad bite all was wonderful.
Coming back for sure"}
