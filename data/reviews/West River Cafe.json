{"text":"A dozen mussels for 3 bucks on Mondays. Pool Table. Cheap drinks. Decent food. Almost always see a fight when you come here. Very local dive bar."}
{"text":"This place is the greatest secret on the west side of Cleveland. Ordered nahcos and they were soooooooooooo good; piled on top was so much cheese that I actually had cheese on the very last chip we ate. It was like eating a big bowl of chilli off of a bed of nachos they put so much cheeses and ground meat on it. Really almost a meal in itself. I ordered the steak sandwich and this is one of the few times I've gotten real steak meat sliced up instead of those real thin so called pieces of steak. I highly recommend this place and I am definitely becoming a regular at this place!!"}
