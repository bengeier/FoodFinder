{"text":"the tacos are delicious and I love the chips and guacamole. Want to try the nachos because I have a good feeling that they will be good"}
{"text":"So good. Like Mucho Burrito but better. The spicy chicken is really good. Great service."}
{"text":"They charge you extra for Guacamole and they spread it VERY thin, barely any and certainly not worth the extra charge. Very small portions of meat etc. Gluten free soft tortillas fall apart the moment you pick them up. Just not worth the price at all!"}
{"text":"Wow wow Gracias to the new owners of this up and coming franchise. .the husband and wife team are very gracious and hard working and willing to make your meal and visit most enjoyable!  

The food is really fresh. .the choices are amazing. . Love love The fresh cilantro.  The whole restaurant and prep area is pristine clean.  

They make it to your taste and then heat and press it in a panini type press which melts the cheese and makes the tortilla nice and crispy!  

These are huge. .we order regular size and are full and happy!  

We usually choose plain or whole wheat tortilla black beans or pinto beans. Shredded meat lettuce cheese fresh thick guacamole corn onion tomato or it maybe pico de gallo black olives freshly chopped cilantro sour cream and forget which sauce but they're all good. . Yum yum yum  oh now I'm craving them. .

We took a wrong turn off symons valley Rd up into the newer subdivision up on the hill Evanston I could be Wrong about the name into to nw anyway and came upon a new strip mall and saw this Mexican small restaurant. . What a gold mine of a find. .we've Been back four times and will be regulars for sure.  About time we get more authentic and fresh Mexican food in yyc .. woohoo! 

Best Mexican and very authentic  taste since we have amazing Mexican food across the usa border to compare!  Fresh and healthy no fatty refried beans or ground beef here!  You won't be disappointed!  Five stars for sure  plus !"}
{"text":"Fffaaaat burrito. Plein de possibilité de garnitures + des option vegé super. Pas trop cher et bons ingredients!! 3 tailles pour le burritos. J aiiiimmmeee!!!!! La salle est un peu petite mais c est dans le hall d un truc universitaire donc! Beaucoup de bruit. Et pas trop de place mais ca se trouve. Excellent je recommande"}
{"text":"tbh like... they don't really know how to roll a burrito, the ingredients are meh at best, they are like always out of rice and fajita veggies and are grotesquely unapologetic about it. but at the same time it's mexican food. so better than no food at all, but nowhere near as good as any other mexican food anywhere."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5 

Not the best burrito I've ever had, but it is pleasant. I got the grilled chicken burrito with all the fixings. The cost is a little high for the quality. Since it is on campus, I'll probably come back and try their tacos!"}
{"text":"The new options at the Bronfman Building (Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University) are way superior to what was there before. There are now two different places: Quesada and Bento Sushi. This review is about Quesada.

While before there used to be an Asian restaurant, the addition of burritos and tacos to the menu is a welcome one. It is what you could expect from a Burrito place: they give you a choice on everything and it is prepared in front of you station to station (meat, then sauce, then vegetables, then heating). And while this is great, it is also a problem: it takes a long time. From day one, there are huge lines that may take 20, 30 minutes before you can leave with your burrito.

Perhaps an option would be to mimic what Bento Sushi does: have a selection of stuff that has been prepared a little before rush hour (so it is still relatively fresh) that people can just pick up and pay for it, while still leaving the option of lining up and having a custom burrito made at the spot."}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment.
There was some confusion with our orders.  The manager made no attempt,
what so ever, to help solve the issue.  Just yelled at us to get out of 'his' restaurant.  
My fish taco was not like any fish taco I have ever eaten, hard tortilla, which were broken and loaded with chipotle.  
One grandson ordered a taco salad.  Never seen one like what he got.
Most unappetizing presentation.

Tables were dirty and so were the floors.
Never again.  Rudeness doesn't do a business any good."}
{"text":"I loved their food until maybe 3 weeks ago and tonight we got the worst service ever! 8:45pm Sep11, 2016. While my husband, me, and my 4 yr old child were enjoying our meal (we just came from a 12-hr drive so we're really hungry!), this lady  told us that she's closing in 2 mins. What restaurant does that?? You don't rush your customers in eating - usually, the \"respectful\" restaurants would let you finish while they start cleaning up the kitchen. But no, this lady is determined to get rid of us. And oh, for the first time today, I didn't like my steak bowl - VERY DRY. Will not come back again until they change their staff! (The previous guy was awesome but we longer see him)."}
{"text":"For anyone looking for corn hard shell tacos in montreal -- they have them here! Finally! We have looked everywhere! Delicious and affordable!"}
{"text":"I have never heard of or seen this place. I happened to stumble upon it since I was in the neighborhood and hungry. Win -win.

I will be honest, I had pretty low expectations. Thought it would be like the typical fast food Mexican kind of place. It defiantly was not. I am a fan now.

Walking in, its clean, modern and smelt so good. I looked at the menu at the counter and decided to order something somewhat healthy. I ordered a veggie quesadilla, which they made fresh in front of me. Love that. Grilling the veggies as well as adding anything extra I may want in it (lettuce, cheese, beans etc. etc.) Only waited a few minutes and in the meantime, reviewed the rest of the menu. Some really great things and I took mental note for next time.

The three staff members were so friendly and nice. They took orders quick and made things as quick as possible too. Since it was close to dinner time, this place was quiet busy. Some customers where staying in and some were doing take out. The place was definitely steady with customers. Which was great since I got to see some of the other things people ordered.

My veggie quesadilla was really fantastic. Since the portions were big, I thought I would eat half of it but I ate it all and in one sitting.  Impressive. Yummy.

Will be back again and next time to try a Big Ass Burrito!!!"}
{"text":"Quesada is inside a busy food court in McGill campus. I took the spicy chicken burrito bowl. It came in filling portions. I also asked for hot peppers and spicy mayo so the food was too spicy for me- but it was my fault for ordering something so spicy. Cheap and tasty food overall."}
{"text":"I couldn't pass up on the offer for a free burrito from here today.  Staff great and food was great...love this place!"}
{"text":"A really great fast food option, as healthy as you want to make it! (whole wheat tortillas, skipping the mayo, brown rice instead of white, veggies to the max)
We missed the Grand Opening free Burrito weekend by a day - dammit.
However, I have zero problema paying $6 for a reg. size burrito. 
It was a good experience.
The service may be new and going through the motions but they were friendly and efficient.
I loaded mine with veg, a bit of sour cream and chicken. Cilantro - hello, I love you, and you too jalapenos!
The burrito was wrapped tight and stayed warm for 45 min until I got home. 
I opened the tin foiled package to just take a bite as I wanted to save it until later and not a chance. I scarfed it all down! 
The reg. size is not huge but enough certainly for me.
There is seating inside. No hot sauce out for customers' use like they have at Mucho Burrito. You also will not find extra napkins, just the one you get in your bag.
I guess they are conserving waste and cash.
I would love to hear Mexican music playing inside.
I recommend it and I will go back."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out. I heard about their catering and was thinking of hiring them for a future event. 
We were in the area and decided to try them out before deciding if we'd book them to cater. It was hard to find. A hangry boyfriend insisted that the restaurant wasn't where I (yelp) was telling him. After driving down warden, turning around in a strange parking lot and driving back up warden we found it. It's beside Licks in the plaza by Best Buy. 

Pros: lots of parking. Near other shops. Loved the selection of sauces. I tried cilantro lime. It was lovely. Two options of beans. The guacamole had chunks of avocado and looked so good. Made fresh I'm sure. Pickled onions were a nice option to add on. The tomatoes were so fresh and big chunks. Everything was delicious. Restaurant is modern, bright and clean. 
Cons: guacamole is extra!!!! This drives me crazy. It's a Mexican restaurant. I expect to have guacamole. It'd be like going to a burger joint and getting told the patty is extra. Lol Staff weren't very friendly. I even enquired about catering and didn't get much of an answer. Menu is basically chicken steak veggie or pork. Not that big compared to other Mexican restaurants. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of their rice. 
Total for one regular and one large chicken burritos with a pop $22. Would we return? Probably. Would I hire them to cater? Perhaps."}
{"text":"Cheap and fast is key here. I got a spicy chicken burrito for ~7$ at lunch rush hour. The line wasn't very long (but it was longer than the adjacent bento place, so I figured it must be better). The ingredients on the line looked nice and fresh. The whole serving was quick and efficient. They packed the burrito in a bag to go, without asking, which was fine for me since the seating area was quite busy and noisy, but it wasn't very warm when I got to eating it later. It's not a particularly good restaurant but it was good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We went here to grab a quick snack. It was our first time so we didn't know what to expect but we were excited for Mexican food. We were disappointed. It was make your own burrito or tacos. We found the servers rude and very loud when they talk to each other (not in English). Won't go back here again and I don't recommend it. Mucho burrito is far far better."}
{"text":"Tried their hard shell fish tacos and they were delicious! Fresh & tasty! Oh and loveedddd their churros! So good!"}
{"text":"Really not that good. Feels like a half baked rip off of Mucho Burrito.

Both the chicken and the beef are excessively spicy even with the mild salsa."}
{"text":"Stopped by this establishment on my way to teaching @ Centennial College and thought I would try them.

Quite frankly the Burritos are forgettable when compared to some of the other Burritos outlets in the area.  Don't waste your time or money for a tasteless burrito (steak) that was served by an arrogant young gentlemen with attitude  who is clueless when it comes to customer service."}
{"text":"This is a new place that just opened.  The service is excellent and it's the only place I found that serves hard tacos around us.  There are other mexican places but they only have the the soft ones.  Your meal is customize with whatever you like.Everything is super fresh!  We ordered 6 tacos (fish, stake); stake burrito; burrito bowl and churros ($36).  Weill be back or sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos (hard and soft shell), burritos, and burrito bowls. All fresh ingredients and made before your eyes.¡ Jarritos chilled  Not dirt cheap but worth every loonie."}
{"text":"I really enjoy a good burrito bowl. Their menu consists of burritos, burrito bowls, tacos, quesadillas, tortilla salad bowls and nachos. This place also offers fresh ingredients like shredded lettuce, corn, salsa, cilantro, cheese,  etc...

I ordered their bean burrito salad bowl. And with all those fresh ingredients, the flavor was just not there for me. I also went the vegetarian route, expecting the guacamole to be included, but there is an extra cost. It fell short of beans, as the portions were small.

The prices are pretty good. And, the customer service was really good. But, overall it was just ok for me."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mexican food, so when I heard there was a new place for me to get some quesadillas, I could not wait to try it.  I am so glad that we finally made it out to Quesada today.

I ordered the chicken quesadilla and of course, said yes to the fresh guacamole.  I was pleased, because the person I was with, ordered one of the HUGE burritos before me and when they asked him if he wanted the guac, he said yes too, but his server did not mention that there was an extra charge.  No, it's not a lot of money- I think about 70 cents extra, but he would have rather known, so just be aware of what ingredients you want added to your dish.  The prices are on the menu overhead, but in the excitement of ordering the delicious food, you may not think about it.  

I have heard that your experience depends on the people working at the time, but other than that one hiccup, the service was very pleasant.  The music was a tad loud so we had to say \"Excuse me?\" a few times while ordering to understand what they were asking.  Once you order and they heat your meal, you are able to sit down and your meals will be brought to  you at your table.

Overall, the service was fast, and the restaurant itself is kept very clean.  The cost of the food is great for the portion sizes you get.  I was highly impressed and being able to customize even your quesadillas like you would a Subway sandwich, made it taste phenomenal.  The churros were tasty and their burritos are also delicious.

I will definitely be back to try more of their menu, such as their burrito bowls- those look delicious too!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"As someone who spent nine and a half years at McGill I can safely say that their food services have always been lacklustre.  It was much appreciated when they made all these new additions to them not so long ago.  Quesada was by far the best of them with their fresh to order burritos.  Prices are fairly reasonable and the food is good to boot.  I always get a burrito but there are other offerings here like quesadillas, salads, etc.

There are three different sizes of burritos.  I always get the medium-sized one as it is just the right size for me.  You first choose your meat (or beans if you're vegetarian) and then you choose the other toppings for your burrito.  My only real beef is that they charge $0.75 for guacamole when it would be ideal if they included it in the price.  

Lineups are crazy at lunch so try to go either before the rush or after.  If you're in a hurry they also keep some pre-made burritos by the cash.  These are the burrito of the day and are only about $5 or $6.  The obvious downside is that they're not made fresh to order and sit under heat lamps for who knows how long."}
{"text":"I had the chicken burrito which was a good size but felt that it was a little cold. I asked for spicey and the spice was good. If it was warmer i would have given 4 stars."}
