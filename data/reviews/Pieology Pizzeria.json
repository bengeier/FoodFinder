{"text":"Great pizza with all the toppings you wish for the same price no matter what is added. A weekly visit for me."}
{"text":"The pizza was so good &tasty,but my only complaint is the military discount did ask the cashier she said yes then im assuming the young mgr says oh no with a attitude.but the cashier did apologize,not her fault but overall great food!!"}
{"text":"Counter service. 

Nice open atmosphere. Looks and feels like a chipotle for pizza. 

The pizza wasn't anything spectacular, but if you're looking for something quick to eat, this is the place. They did no do a good job dispersing the toppings. We had one slice that basically had just cheese. 

We asked someone for a towel so we could wipe down the table. He informed us that he would be right back to take care of that. He must have forgotten because when he returned shortly after, he started collecting plates and asking people how everything was going. We had to ask the manager to assist us. Then as we were eating our pizza, we watched the same person that we asked to help us, wipe down a table for two teenage girls. Apparently, to get service you must be a young attractive female."}
{"text":"Nope not again I'm sorry! Soggy pizza and the quality of the spicy sausage is trash! We got 4 different pizzas and did not like 1! I will stick to the best Fired Pie!!!! At least I can say I tried this pizza. Womp Womp womp"}
{"text":"I love coming here and I would rate my experience 5 stars but I got horrible customer service today. It was my sisters first time and as soon as I came up to order I told this lady I wanted reg crust and she was like wel first I have to make it first! While pressing the dough she mouthed \"stupid bitch\" honestly idk wtf I did.. and she was very attitudy after that. Being someone who works two jobs in customer service I did not want to let this slide! If it happens again I will be speaking with a manager"}
{"text":"The working station looks very unsanitary and very sloppy. The workers are poorly trained and twice I've been there they forget an ingredient I tell them to add on the pizza. They burnt the pizza. TWICE!!! I expected so much of this place being that I've tried it in Cali and it was great there. Its disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been to Pieology countless times and I came to this location today with a fellow EMT. I was very unsatisfied with the service. To start things off, they were obviously under staffed. It took 20 minutes for me to get to order. To top it off, after waiting all this time, I did not receive my discount that I have never had a problem receiving for being an EMT. I have been to many locations of Pieology including the one at the MGM Grand and have never ran into this problem, receiving my discount with no questions asked. Today, the cashier told me he had been working there for a year and had never heard of such a thing, he turned around to a girl loading pizzas in the oven (not a manager or higher level) and she immediately gave him a disgusted look and shook her head no and he came back saying she had been there for longer and hadn't ever used it either. I have returned to Pieology for their appreciation of my underpaid job many times on the job and off the job without question. 
I was very taken aback by the lack of customer service and lack of support I received for public service. My friend and I both were quickly pushed aside and not even offered a beverage or anything for the extra $10 we ended up paying because we were unaware we were not going to receive this discount. If I would have known this was going to happen, I would not have waited in line for 20 minutes to receive rude service, but would have gone elsewhere with my money."}
{"text":"Alfredo/white sauce was awesome! Prices were good. Only downfall was the employees sitting at a table in the lobby texting/lounging while people are waiting in line. Also, the red sauce was fizzy/bubbly. Not sure I'd get that again, but I'll definitely back for their white sauce!"}
{"text":"This place is brilliant!... It brings a broader variety of eclectic toppings like roasted red peppers candied walnuts smoked sausage links or fresh ricotta *( )  While also maintaining a quality staff of fun, responsive & considerate personalities like shanna & kali at chandler blvd ! 
Thx for being pertty great & numyumnam!

* (Unlimited ingredients wit  no addon charges for only 8.29 a Pie... p.s & by the by!)"}
{"text":"Fresh pizza all the time. Nice flavor, reasonable price for the size.

They should just work a little on the customer service, then I love it."}
{"text":"Yummy bbq chicken pizza, not too expenisve. Thin crust and flavorful. Looking forward to going again!"}
{"text":"We started going to this place from 1 year. Last time when I went to order the pizza.. they are out of some ingredients and did not have a curtesy to refill the bins until I asked. As per rules they are supposed to change the gloves for every order like subway does but, skipped that part as well. Finally after going through all the headache they over baked and spoiled my pizza."}
{"text":"First time in...Customer service is great. The three workers were awesome! We created our own pizza and finished the whole thing. Will be back."}
{"text":"HEALTH CODE VIOLATION. The manager was handling the food (toppings area) WITHOUT the use of a hairnet and/or cap. Absolutely disgusting. All of the workers seemed miserable, especially one. I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Nice pizza that you get to choose your toppings to, very sweet staff. It's really affordable and in a good area too. Definitely come here!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this place a ten but only allowed to give its five.  The food tastes really good and had great service.   Overall, the best experience I have had from anywhere in Vegas.  People were friendly from the time you walked in until you left. Great experience and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Another visit and another great experience.  To all those at the Chandler location, great job with the personalities.  It's great to come in a month later and still see the great attitudes that we encountered on our first visit.  The pies were prepared exactly as we asked.  Well done and kudos.

Not sure, Avondale location.  Got beat out last year and the early polls look like another defeat may be in your future..."}
{"text":"If we could give a 3 1/2 stars I would but being the case have to give it the 3.. My husband and I have been here twice and the first time was awesome we thought the concept was great. The only thing we could really say was the menu is so small that the only people that can see it are the ones who are at the very front of the line. Also I customize my pizza, since I don't care for meats on pizza, and got all veggies. It took awhile to get our pies and when we did my veggies where still cold(I had mushrooms and they where still white, cooked mushrooms are brownish and soft), but my crust was golden brown. We asked them to reheat it and they did. Veggies where cooked but the crust was burnt now...

Second visit they where pushing us down the line so fast, while being the only ones in line, we didn't get to say we like extra cheese and when we finally got a chance (we where only the next station over) ,and we where told us no, there's Parmesan over there. No?! We are paying, so yes. The worker said it slows down the line(there was only one couple behind us now at this point, so not like there's a huge rush or anything). Finally the manager said fine but only this time.. This time?? How about don't push us so fast down and we can tell u how we like our pizza.. Finally we see they are done cooking and they drop it on the floor no big deal accidents happen and they made us a new one quickly.

Over all it went from being awesome to just eh. Just our biggest complaint is being told no because that's how the owner wants it. But they have to realize customers forget sometimes and being told no over just wanting some extra cheese is ridiculous, because of a line.. Maybe put a larger menu up and ppl would have their minds made up before they get to the ordering station.."}
{"text":"Staff always very friendly and fun. Have been there twice and both times the pizza was very good. Love the wall decor also!"}
{"text":"This UPDATE is an expansion of my original \"note to self\" review. 

Management should pay attention to the negative reviews & act if this place is going to stay open. Not everyone takes to Yelp to leave a review, but they DO walk with their feet & take their $$ elsewhere after a bad experience. 

I drove from Silverado Ranch to meet friends here for dinner on a Saturday night. None of us had heard about this place until that day when someone in the group saw it earlier that morning while passing by. I wasn't keen on driving this far to eat somewhere I'd never heard of so I took to Yelp to see what I could find. At the time, the reviews of this place were poorly. I prayed our experience would be different. 

There were 4 of us. Saturday night. Empty restaurant. The tables were all pushed together forming straight lines the length of the restaurant. The tables clearly, & were in dire need of, a good wipe down with spray cleaner. 

I was the last to order in our group. First, the counter is too high. Being 5'2 I had to stand on my toes to speak to the person on the other side. Rather, shout at. It was too darn loud from the ovens & acoustics. Being deaf in one ear I could barely hear; I can only imagine how someone with full hearing might respond to the noise. 

Having read on Yelp something about olive oil being drizzled on the pizza I asked what came on the pizza.  I was told sauce, cheese, toppings. No mention of olive oil. I ordered a gluten free crust with red sauce (toppings were to be told to the next guy).  This employee proceeds with starting my pizza only to grab a squeeze bottle & drizzle something on the red sauce. I halt him & ask what is he doing. \"HUH?\" he replies, only to tell me its olive oil. I asked him to start over as olive oil wasn't what I wanted nor did he tell me it was when I first asked him what came on the pizza. He asks me whats the difference, olive oil is in the red sauce. My response, again, is he never mentioned it prior AND if its in the red sauce already that's fine but I don't need or want more. After an eye-roll & quick shove-outta-the-way of the first pizza he starts over & tosses my pizza like a frisbee to the next guy.  He doesn't notice that I notice him take the original crust with olive oil & face plant it into the bin while muttering under his breath. (It was too loud for me to hear!)

The next guy, again, very hard to see & hear & I am still standing on my toes. He was a bit friendlier, but not by much, & added my requested toppings & put it in the oven. I move down to the next person on this pizza ordering conveyor belt & hand my card to a snobby girl to pay & obtain a number. 

I make my way to my friends to see the 3 of them, not 5 minutes after I begin my order at the counter, are halfway through their meal. As the table hadn't been wiped down I had to maneuver around the cheese & peppers left behind by someone else to find a clean spot.  A few minutes later my pizza is brought to the table and the 3 are waiting for me to start eating my meal.  We were seated nearest the entrance and it was STILL noisy!!  We were yelling at each other in order to converse. 

My pizza was very pretty: pepperoni, Italian sausage, green peppers. Very thin crust burnt on the edges. (It is hard to cut thru with plastic knife & fork.)Gooey cheese. I declared it GOOD after my first bite but soon after declared it GROSS as by the 3rd slice my pizza is now room temperature.  I was shocked that not only was the crust black, it had cooled quickly & the taste was so different.  WHAT PRIOR YELPERS HAD EXPERIENCED. 

While I was eating, someone decided to come along and not only sweep around our table, they decided to inconvenience me, while eating, to move my legs to sweep under the table & pick up my food to wipe the table down.  UN. REAL. 

Sadly, my experience mimicked that of other Yelpers: loud/hard to hear while ordering; rude employees; burnt pizza; great $7.95+tax pizza while hot, gross at room temp. 

Within days of posting my \"note to self,\" I received a message from JAKE J claiming to be the GM, asking for a 2nd chance (see pic). I ignored the message & here's why:  i drove from Silverado Ranch for a $7.95+tax pizza...ONCE. My first experience was disappointing, why would I drive that distance again?  (It might not seem far to some but for me it is.) If I lived nearby...maybe. I never go to Summerlin, certainly not making a special trip to have another disappointing experience. I can order a pizza for $8.99 elsewhere, pick it up in less than 10 minutes & enjoy it, hot, room temp, or cold...for dinner AND next days lunch/dinner. 

Since I ate there, it appears issues I and those before me remain. It's still too loud. Pizza still comes out burnt. It's still great while hot & blah at room temp.  The employees are still rude. I'm baffled by all the glowing reviews."}
{"text":"$7.95 for an 11\" pizza with unlimited toppings. Amazing pizza that you are able to make to your liking. How can you go wrong with that? The costumer service is outstanding. They finished making my pizza fast. And Pieology is super clean."}
{"text":"First time going to Pieology and it was a great experience! I went on a Tuesday around 11:45 am and it wasn't too crowded. Unlimited toppings are a major plus! I ended up making my own custom pizza with herb garlic butter on the crust and house red sauce with mozzarella/parmesan cheese. I topped my pizza with sausage, pepperoni, spicy chicken and veggies. I opted out of the after bake, but next time I will definitely try. The pizza came out pretty quickly and I also purchased a spindrift raspberry and cranberry drink. Only downside is they should offer recycling for plastic and glass bottles. Overall atmosphere was pretty laid back and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I always get extra toppings! I think that it is a better price than Pizza Hut or even Dominos because you can get unlimited toppings for just one offer! The place is always clean, and the people who work there are very generous. That is why I love to go to Pieology!"}
{"text":"Great concept, fair to middling execution. Service is slow pizza is avg. Mod Pizza is still the gold standard for this concept. Still, this is slightly above pie 5's offering"}
{"text":"Love this place. I get my pizza exactly how I like it at a cheap price! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this place, they kinda skimp you on the toppings, on top of just throwing them all in the middle of the pizza, the gluten free always comes out burnt and the pizzas are kind of small for the price. Not to mention no phone service in this area. I prefer the pizza kitchen much better than this place."}
{"text":"Pizza here was good, service was good but making the pizza was a little messy. The sauce and and toppings falling all over the place touching each other, so if your allergic to mushrooms they might fall into the bell peppers you might be out of luck trying to get certain toppings kept out of your pizza. I would still recommend this place for a quick fresh pizza for dinner!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried out Pieology last night, and were pleasantly surprised.  It's basically like the Chipotle of pizza -- you walk through the line and pick out your crust, sauce, toppings, etc. The pizzas were good, and unlimited toppings for only $8 seems like a great deal to me."}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle, but with Pizza! There is a variety of sauces, meats and veggies to choose from. The pizzas are cheap and delicious! We are addicted! Also, when Michael is working, the service is always great!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!  Delicious pizza!  The pesto sauce was a perfect pesto!! Great service , particularly from Colin!  I would definitely recommend it!! They have outdoor seating for when it is good weather too!!"}
{"text":"Oh gee PIEOLOGY you keep me happy while I wait in line and read all the inspiring quotes on the wall.  I've been twice so far and the staff has been great during both visits.

First visit I stuck with a standard pepperoni, sausage, onions and peppers on the REGULAR CRUST.  Second visit I tried the GLUTEN-FREE and surprisingly I liked the crust more!  The pizza is quick... and good... and fun to build your own... but if you are looking to satisfy a real pizza craving it might not happen here."}
{"text":"We really like Pieology. We can all get our own pizza with as many toppings we want for the same price. I love the thin crust and the herb butter. My husband, who isn't much of a pizza person, really enjoyed his veggie pizza. My two kids split a pepperoni pizza and were actually quiet since they were eating and enjoying the food. While I agree that they can skimp on the toppings, they've always put on extra without hassle when I ask for more."}
{"text":"I don't like the customer service here; the cashier here snapped at me because I got in the way of him looking at another patrons ass. He gestured to another cashier who replied it's all him because he's married. I'm not returning."}
{"text":"I have never been before but I will definitely be back. The pizza was great. The employees were extremely friendly. And the price is fantastic. That is a natural hat trick!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here! When it's slow, the workers make conversations with you, and they're always lovely.

You get to make your own pizza by picking what type crust, sauce, cheese, veggies, and meat you want. You can freely tell them if you want more of one thing if you feel they give you too little. No matter what toppings you get, it's all the same price. 

The best part is that the service is quick and easy, and it tastes great in the end."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Arizona, in love with the sauce and staff is great not a single complain every time we are in there it's such an amazing experience, it does get very packed but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Anthony was awesome! I love pieology, love pizza but can't do dairy. No problem at pieology."}
{"text":"I have been here several time and have had excellent service every time! Love the special fruit/lemonade fountain drinks and the atmosphere. If you're not in the mood for pizza, they do also have salads. They have 4-5 beers on tap too!I'm not really a tv person per se but they have 3 big screen tv's and play good, modern music as well. Love this place! Think I might just become a regular here!"}
{"text":"First time at Pieology Pizzeria and I was impressed. Friendly service, short wait and delicious pizza. My only regret is that I didn't order a larger pizza. I will go back!"}
{"text":"If you're a Fired Pie fan, this place will disappoint you. The sauce and topping selections fall short. The crust had no flavor, they didn't have fresh mozzarella, and overall was not as tasty as Fired Pie. I really wanted to like this place, but I'll stick to Fired Pie."}
{"text":"The best build your own artisan pizza made your way. I love it! I can put whatever toppings I want and however heavy I want. Bake fresh with fresh ingredients make this a perfect anytime stop. Great twist from your average pizza shops. I highly recommend for all pizza lovers out there."}
{"text":"The food was good, really good. But the service wasn't as great. I ordered my pizza, when they finished and pulled it out they dropped about 20% of the pizza (toppings, cheese, and sauce). I brought it up to the Manager and asked if I wanted it to be made again, I didn't have time so I declined. He then just played it off and said like \"half off next time or something\". That felt like poor customer service to me."}
{"text":"Great dough. Bad marinera sauce that tastes like water.  Cheap  ingredients. Great ambience and atmosphere.  A bit expensive  for what you get. 

I think most people judge  it by its appearance as opposed to anything  else. Plus, what do people in vegas know about  a good pie? Lol"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Good costumer service.  Good location.  
The food? Not a big fan. Good dough. Horrible marinera sauce. Like way too much water in it. The toppings are just normal.  
I think most prefer the way it is made right in front of them and the atmosphere.  The portions are good though. 
Price?? Eh..."}
{"text":"Nothing better than creating the perfect pizza customized by yourself. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised! A great thin crust pizza baked quickly, with unlimited toppings of your choice. Loved it!! Pizza lovers - this place is a must! Others - give it a try you'll want to come back again"}
{"text":"I love pizza and Pieology is great because they carry vegan cheese and since I am lactose intolerant it's a great place.  Why 2 star's , this Pieology doesn't feel the need to carry Vegan cheese, I guess the don't care about the people with ailments."}
{"text":"Any or all toppings for $8 is well worth it! The staff were all friendly and when Mike (I mean George--inside joke, lol) brought my pizza he apologized for the presentation (one half was a little more charred then the other). He immediately had another one made and boxed to go at no extra charge. (The 1st one was still very good). 
Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes choices, a friendly staff, and great food and price. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here yet but my neighbors all rave about it will give extra star when I try. Lol I can say the place across the street is good but not here yet. Hopefully this weekend ill keep every one updated. (Since your all waiting anxiously on my opinion)"}
{"text":"Great customer service at this location and the pizza was the best I've had at any Pieology!"}
{"text":"I went here on a whim, the result a fast custom fair priced pizza. I will totally return."}
{"text":"Great service and perfect pizza every time! Very clean inside and polite staff!"}
{"text":"This is the chipotle of pizzas.

The options were almost overwhelming.

I got the wheat crust and split the pizza, half red sauce and half white. I went with a veggie pizza on the white sauce side and meat on the red.

They cook the pizzas really fast. I didn't have to wait too long at all.

I will say that they did mess up a bunch of other people's orders around me. I chalk this up to the restaurant being new and the employees having a learning curve.

The bathrooms were clean. There are a couple TVs broadcasting popular nonsense."}
{"text":"Dinner plate sized personal pizzas made however you like them for about $8. I thought the pizza was a good value. Salads were full of toppings too. Staff were friendly and excellent, given the fast casual environment. Would eat here again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I've been to most pizza places in Vegas.  Something about the ambiance, the cooking style, the crust, the speed of service, I'll come back over and over.  It's worth a try, you'll be surprised.  Happy place to have great pizza!  You choose the ingredients so how can you go wrong?!!"}
{"text":"First I tried to order online and they must not be set up for that.  Then I called to order for pick up and she told me they don't deal with people over the phone.  Nevermind!  We are going elsewhere."}
{"text":"After visiting Pizza Rev in California I was wondering why this concept never made it to Las Vegas. While on our way to the mall at Downtown Summerlin, we noticed Pielogy im the parking lot. We originally planned on going to MTO Cafe for lunch but decided to give Pieology a try. We were thinking that it would be similar to Pizza Rev. We walked in, peeped around and yes sir indeed it was just like Pizza Rev!!

Ordering your custom pizza is a very simple process. Staff were not stingy w/ the ingredients and let you pile on as much as you want. The price isn't bad at all for $7.95.  I was surprised at the Pieology experience and will be definitely going back. Nice to see Pieology decided to come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Five stars for fast food custom pizza. My pizza and soft drink were delicious. 

The mall has a nice \"Summerlin vibe.\"

There was no wait and ample parking on a Tuesday evening, 6:30 pm.

The young staff made great pizza, delivered to the table within minutes of ordering. All four pizzas were baked to perfection, unlike some in the pictures above.

The prepackaged salads at the cash register looked tasty, and I might pick one up for lunch next time.

Bottom line: our family of four enjoyed the experience, and we look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The staff is always so awesome and I'm never disappointed when I come here! I tell my friends about it constantly."}
{"text":"We love this pizza! My kids like that they can pick out their own toppings and we don't have to share. 
I tried the Margarita Pizza past time and it was delicious. 
My kids tried the dessert pizza and it was delicious.
The restaurant is always very clean and the staff is very nice. 
A great place to go with a family or group and everyone can get what they want."}

{"text":"I'm so excited about this pizza place. Great pizzas make your own and just go bonkers. I get the pesto and garlic butter for my sauce and I go crazy putting all kinds of toppings. I love the thin crust and the wait time is about 5 to 10 max every time I go. Service is excellent and courteous. Again you will not be disappointed, love at first bite."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  It's like a subway restaurant for pizza.  Go down the line to have your pie made and 5 minutes later it arrives at your table fresh out of the brick style oven.  I had to pass this place on the way to the monorail twice a day for a week and every time it smelled great.  Probably went here 3 or 4 times during my stay.   Highly recommend doing the \"pierise\" which adds a second half of a dough ball to make it a thick crust.

Great toppings, selection of 5 different cheeses available and the sausage is especially good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food. Great staff. Jose is the best.
HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of pizza! I especially enjoy these eateries where I can dictate the amount of toppings on my pie. The whole made-to-order concept is pleasing to the stomach. There are other made-to-order pie places that I frequent however, not as much as I do Pielology. This establishment is larger than most so allows for the larger crowds to stand in line, order and not feel crowded by people. Ugh!

The service here at Chandler Fashion Square is exceptionally good. I'm always greeted with a smile and a nice gesture when I exit. 

The addition of olive oil on the crust before baking adds a slight crunch to the bite that...Ohh Emm Gee...it's hard to explain. They offer both regular and wheat crust (wheat is the way to go). The pie size appears to be larger than most places leaving me with 1/2 a pie every time (perfect for my inner chubby kid). The toppings here are fresh and the tomatoes (they have the cherry tomatoes halved...just how I like 'em...way better than regular sliced or roma). 

Pieology is my first choice for made-to-order pizza; even though there are two different places closer to my home. The longer ride is totally worth the pie!"}
{"text":"Pieology is absolutely phenomenal! I am more on the healthier side when it comes to my food, there are so many options for natural/green toppings and more. Colin is extremely professional, helpful, and kind along with the rest of the staff (patient). This is my new favorite place, we love it!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza with all fresh natural ingredients! Fast service and delicious options."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best pizza places we have been to that is pretty fast our pizza choice we made was amazing and very tasteful ( will be different for everyone since everyone has different tastebuds in what they want ) but our choice was really good. Service was excellent and wish we would've gotten our waitress's name because she was outstanding. Overall excellent place to have some lunch."}
{"text":"The pizza's are fantastic!!! The best we have had in a long time. My husband and I absolutely love the PIZZA here.  They even have a few outstanding staff members like Anthony who was  extremely welcoming and positive. We appreciated how he treated us as VALUED  GUESTS. 
Renee 
p.s. 
We would have given them 5 stars but didn't because they didn't have any vegetarian salad dressings to choose from. Hopefully, next time we go they will have a better selection. We love Pizza and salad together."}
{"text":"May I Start With \"The Food Is Awesome\". Great Great Service. Fast And For $22.00 Or So For 2 People Its Way More Than Worth It. I've Stopped In About 5 Times And Every Single Time Was A Great Dine. I Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"I thought their pizza was fantastic.  I loved the fact I could have exactly what I wanted. It was clean and the staff was friendly. I will definitely be recommending it and visiting it often."}
{"text":"THE BEST PIZZA PLACE IN TOWN. We eat here often in the store, but the last few times have used the online ordering and got our pizza to go. Its always ready the minute we arrive and is just as good as ordering in store. Anytime we have family in town, we take them here! Always fast, fresh and friendly!"}
{"text":"This just opened up by our house, so we had to try it out. We usually go to Fired Pie...BUT NO LONGER! THIS IS OUR NEW FAVORITE PLACE! the staff is always so friendly and fast. We feel like we are visiting friends anytime we go. Lots of room, clean and AMAZING pizza! Unlimited toppings for one low price. So many choices or fresh toppings, always cooked perfectly"}
{"text":"Customer service is great, the concept is great, and the presentation and cleanliness of the restaurant itself is also nice. However the pizza tastes so bland and frankly it's disgusting."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever! OMG Service was great and I brought a large party in and the manager brought us dessert.  He was so funny.  His name was jake.  Great service.  Great food and the price was amazing.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After reading the earlier reviews...It seems as though the management is reading them and actively making adjustments. The two big \"negatives\" from earlier reviews were the \"frugalness\" of the toppings and the acoustics. Well, seeing as though it is a franchise and there is not much they can do about the acoustics, I am going to ignore that one and solely base this review on the food...

...Which was outstanding. The \"toppings issue\" from previous reviews was completely absent from my experience. I asked for pepperoni and they put on a lot of it...where all 8 slices each had a few pieces. I asked for bacon and she took an enormous handful and spread it evenly throughout the pizza (I was even a little concerned that it was too much...which is a great problem to have!). All of the vegetables were plentiful and they have an AMAZING selection to choose from. Literally there is not a topping here that you can't get. The crust has a really good thin artisan feel to it, and they allow you to choose from 3 crust butter flavors which is a great little touch. I will say that, by default, they use a small amount of sauce on their pizza (not that they are frugal with it, but this is just how they build their pizza it seems) so, if you are like me and like your pizza decently \"saucy\" make sure to ask for extra marinara sauce!

I know this place opened this week, but I really hope the staff doesn't lose its enthusiasm and professionalism as time goes and they get more comfortable, as you see with so many places. They were all very nice and personable and each had a smile on his/her face. Several times I notices employees and management going around the dining area and asking how their food is and if there is anything they could do for them. Great service guys...keep it up!

Now the price...which is actually pretty decent for a high-concept chain like this. $8 for a pretty large personal pizza (which could feed 2 people, or 1 person two times)  is a good price...$4/serving."}
{"text":"I was there the first day that Micheal started and he was so nervous.  I have been back several times and he always acknowledges me and has grown as an employee.  I enjoy watching the interaction of the staff with us customers as well as each other.  It is obvious that Brittany is a leader that is well respected.  The rest of the crew including Nya, Emily and Izaiyah (sp?) look up to her and she treated them with respect.  I always enjoy what my son calls \"salad on crust' as I eat vegetarian.  Hint, adding walnuts and craisins really elevates any vegetarian pizza!!  

I brought my Aunt from Michigan who was skeptical at first but is a new fan!!  We will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Right off the bat let me say that the service alone is 5 stars without question. The staff were genuinely friendly and very helpful. The food was just OK.

We had the opportunity to try the barbecue chicken and Alfredo. The bbq chicken was nice but the Alfredo lacked depth of flavour which was odd as everything smelled good and the  ingredients were very fresh. While I may not go back anytime soon others may enjoy this more than we did and are encouraged to try it at least once.

Special shout out to Colin who was very enthusiastic and funny."}
{"text":"The staff was rude! Even the manager. I asked to put cheese on the top of my pizza After the toppings and was given 3 different answers; it is against the rules we can't do it. It will hold up the line to it is against health regulations. I can't order my \"made to order\" pizza the way I want it because the way they layout the toppings in their assembly line. Then to top it off they burnt the pizza crust. My kids had to cut off outer crust and only ate the inside third of the pie. Terrible. First and last visit."}
{"text":"I was expecting a clean place and was disappointed. 4:30 so before the dinner rush. Dirty tables and crumbs and crust chunks on the flloor. After we sat down one of the employees started to clean the tables. She said it was shift change and the people from the prior shift always leave a mess. 
The pizza was ok. It's a super thin crust pizza which isn't my favorite.  The toppings were fresh and plentiful.   They didn't have plates! The server offered an additional pan which we took.
I can't say I'm overly impressed.  You get what you pay for, right? We got a $7.95 pizza. I doubt we will bother coming back."}
{"text":"First time at Pieology Pizzaria, it was excellent.  Loved the crust and the fact that you can custom order as many toppings as you want for no extra charge was a huge bonus. Very friendly staff, thanks Anthony, and the others whose names I didn't get! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So it's not the best pizza in the world but I give it 5 stars because of how quick, clean, and tasty it is. For being \"fast food\" it's pretty good. You enter and it has the subway kind of set up where you choose the ingredients while they make the pizza in front of you. It only takes 3 minutes to cook and costs $8 with taxes. Great deal, good food, check it out."}
{"text":"Aweso....mmmm..e! Like a Subway but for pizza! Unlimited toppings/sauce/veggies/cheese/meat. Super quick and employees were also super friendly! Great Value! My total came out to a little over $8.00..for a personal pizza, that's unheard of!"}
{"text":"One word great for both service and food. I ordered your creation and everything was fresh. Loved it. Will be back and bring friends."}
{"text":"When I walked via the Underground from MGM for the first time I was pleasantly surprised to find Pieology. Vegan pizzas made-to-order for days! What was even better was the attention to service by the employees, especially Adrianna and Gina.

Adrianna made me probably three pies throughout my stay all the while flashing a huge smile and exchanging pleasantries each and every time (on totally separate days, I'm not a total glutton!) Although this was entirely not required she made sure that not only my pizza was on-point but that I felt welcome each and every time I ordered.

And Gina was ever-present assisting behind the line but also keeping the dining area clean and comfortable. When there was a snafu with my order she made sure that I felt taken care of and her consideration ultimately made me confident in returning to Pieology over and over and over.

On my next trip to Vegas I'm coming back to Pieology whether I'm staying at the MGM or not! Hopefully sooner than later and hopefully Adrianna and Gina will be working!"}
{"text":"Pieology is amazing. I love that they offer the ability to customize a pizza that is a great individual size. It makes ordering pizza for a large group, which I do often, very easy and everyone is always happy because they are getting what they want. The customer service is always top notch, which is awesome, especially when I come in to order 10-13 pizzas at one time. Of the 10-15 people we always have on the order I have yet to receive a negative complaint. Great job pieology DTS!"}
{"text":"Cool little place that's been open for a few weeks. There are often hipster type places with deeply underwhelming overpriced food. SmashBurger and MOD Pizza come to mind, glad to say this Place has solid pizza. It was tasty and reasonably priced. The staff was super friendly and carried real conversation while they made my pizza. It caught me off guard but was refreshing. I'll definitely drop by again and recommend giving it a shot."}
{"text":"Very good. Tasted fresh. Staff was friendly. Customize your pizza with as much toppings as you want, loved it."}
{"text":"Great pizza option on the Strip!  Especially like the build-your-own option--for both the pizza and salad!  Great idea!!!  Tasty pizza, casual place, chill environment...will visit next time we're in town for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food quality is great, and is very wholesome. I don't know why they have any negative reviews they are seriously some of the best pizza we have had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was here when it first opened up next to my job, and still this day I have always recommend highly. Friendly people, great pizza. What more can you ask for when the price is way less then what you pay for."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, pizza has been great other times but today was just terrible. It was NOT busy at all when I ordered so no reason why my order was burnt. I will give it another try another day and update my review."}
{"text":"I'm totally a pizza snob and this place... Was amazing! I loved it.. My friends teased me that from the time I took my first bite I didn't say a word until I was on my 4th slice! I couldn't stop eating! So I'd definitely recommend Pieology to anyone and everyone! You create your own pizza... Exactly how you want it! You get unlimited toppings too! So if you're in the mood for pizza.. PIEOLOGY IS THE PLACE TO GO!"}
{"text":"Pizza is a subjective thing, and one man's perfect pizza may make another person say \"yuk.\" Having said that, the Glad to Meat You (I believe that's what they call it) is among the very best pizzas I've ever had. 

The business model is sort of like Kramers idea in the Seinfeld episode crossed with Chipotle business model. You design your own pizza by choosing crust, sauce, cheeses and toppings from a wide variety. You see your pie being assembled so you can fine tune the assembly process, a little more of this, a little less of that. Or you can lack imagination like me and pick a package off a short list of options and customize that.

The ingredients are first rate and plentiful. And the pizza comes to your table within seconds of being out of the oven. It doesn't get any fresher than that.

Tucked away at the wrong end of a strip mall, this place is a bit hard to find. But it is definitely worth the effort."}
{"text":"I stopped by a couple of days ago with the mindset of getting chipotle, however this place caught my eye and I decided to try something new. I ordered a \"Classic Margarita\" I think it was and have to say best decision of my life and in addition to that the crew members were out stand in and fast. It was set up into 3 stations dough, then vegetable, then meat and it was manned by 2 people I believe their names were Jose and Diara. Despite them being incredible fast when making me pizza they were able to a hold decent conversations with me and make me feel welcomed; Diara even helped me decide what pizza to get with a couple of laughs. The other crew members were great as well all very friendly and the pizza was once again delicious definitely looking to go back!"}
{"text":"HIS: Had a quick lunch and man did this place deliver. Chipotle style assembly line starting from your sauce on a nice sized personalized pizza (tomato, pesto, bbq marinara, Alfredo, and a bunch more!) followed by cheese, veggie and lastly meat. Tons of options in each department and the best part is its unlimited. Extra cheese, extra meat, extra veggies? No problem! Unlimited must be pricey then eh? Nope, $7.95 but that doesn't include a drink which is about an extra $2 depending on the size. (No beer). Like I said earlier the pizza is the perfect lunch size (for a guy like me at least).

The location is a bit out of the way in the Downtown Summerlin area. The interior is large with plenty of tables just like a typical fast food spot. 

A quick, perfect pizza piled high with the toppings you want that won't burn a hole in your pocket. Stop by and check it out. I'll be back soon for sure and next time bring Her."}
{"text":"I honestly do not understand the positive reviews. If u are going to check out a new place in downtown summerlin, then great. If u want a good pizza, go to any grocery store and buy a frozen pizza. We waited in line for about 15 mins. It was painfully slow.
One guy starts u off w your sauce. So the worker next to him waits, no one helps eachother out. It was the slowest process in the world. 

The kids behind the counter just aren't restaurant workers. They are just painfully slow. The pizza came out pretty quickly. The crust is paper thin. There is an inconvenient positioning of the soda fountain. The give like 3 oz cups for water so all the water drinkers keep returning causing a huge cluster and thats right where u pay so its super congested. 

The restaurant was so dirty. We sat by the window and the window sill was covered in crushed red pepper. My first bite all the toppings fells off. So i grabbed a fork at the beverage bar area. There was one left. I looked inside the container, you can see all the dirt, they must never clean it. 

Luckily it was pretty cheap, but it should be cheap considering the crust is like a tortilla and the toppings are very cheap. I would imagine everything comes in frozen but I honestly dont know. They are definitely canned pineapples. 

Overall, the pizza is just really poor quality. But im going against the grain according to the yelp reviews. If you want good pizza, grimaldis is pretty close, along w any gas station or supermarket would be better."}
{"text":"Delicious!  It's great to be able to customize our pizzas.   Love the food and the personality of the Mike's brought the experience to another level."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but the service was better! T needs a raise and/or a promotion. Also, I appreciate all the napkins you supply!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is dirty, perhaps the cleaning crews day off?
Out of water cups, need to buy soda cup.
Pizza is good but it's a pizza how could it be bad?
1st visit, last visit"}
{"text":"Mike instantly greeted us at the door upon arrival.  Very pleasant and welcoming.  Loved the salad and pizza.  Will definitely go back.  Highly recommend it.  There was an issue with staff the previous night turn off the switch for the pizza ovens.  We ate salads first then ordered our pizzas.  Mistakes happen.  Who cares.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The staff are really friendly and they helped me out with the ingredients."}
{"text":"Great pizza place. Very thin crust which I am not normally a fan of. 10x better than 800 Degrees, although I am not sure that says much. I really like custom built. 

7.95 for unlimited toppings. A variety of vegetables and meats. They also have a selection of sauces they will drizzle over when the pie is done.   

Ryan helped us at the counter and took a lot of pride in his work. Everyone was very friendly. 

I didn't get the cinnamon bread but the people next to us say it was delicious and only $3.00!!"}
{"text":"Wanted some pizza. Great place because you can create your own!! Go ahead and add all your favorite ingredients! It'll make every bite worth while."}
{"text":"I'm in town from Chicago visiting my sister and she suggested that we go here for dinner last night. I was hesitant at first because let's be honest, Chicago pizza is THE BEST! Plus, I'd been eating a ton of it this past week. Because of my lameness, I opted for the classic salad. It was tasty but would have been better if the chicken was warmed. My family loved their pizzas and now, I can vouch for it's deliciousness because I snagged some leftovers. The main reason I rated this restaurant five stars though is because of the exemplary service we received from the assistant manager, Mike. He was so funny and personable! At the risk of sounding thirsty, I've gotta say, he's damn cute too (holla at me Mike :-p). Seriously though, as someone who has worked in customer service for many years, he's a great example of how a manager should interact with customers. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I called in an order for a pizza and was told it would be ready in 45 MINUTES. I was shocked and the response on the other end was that \"there was a long line\"...? That's why I'm calling ahead? To skip the line? Right? Like just put the pizza in? Upon picking up the pizza I had to wait in said line for another 40 minutes to pay. The takeout system is 0/10.

I decided to give it another chance, called ahead again, and was told it would take 10 minutes. AWESOME GREAT GOOD JOB GUYS! Nope. I got there when they said it would be done but had to wait another 10 minutes. They brought out a burnt pizza. I then waited another 30 minutes for a new one. 

Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I've been to Pieology over 20 times and have NEVER been disappointed. Their wheat pizza crust is delicious! There's an awesome selection of cheese, sauces, veg, and meat - and you can get as much as  want for one low price! I always get red sauce on my pizza but my boyfriend can't get enough of their Buffalo, it's quite hot for me but perfect for him. Their salads are also nothing to scoff at, love their salads. The manager and his team are so friendly and helpful. Keep up the good work, guys!"}
{"text":"I am only giving 4 stars because the pizza is so good. And the staff is friendly. But upper management or owners really need to staff more people these poor kids are running around with their heads cut off and it really backs up the line"}
{"text":"Look, I would of gave one star but the one young man behind the register made my pizza and was virtually the only employee IN the restaurant working and was doing his best. There's two other employees, one is out front smoking a cigarette (obviously on break) which I think is foul to have to look at. The other also probably on break was talking to a friend in the parking lot. So my perception of the the inside. I walk in the place is empty. I start to order how I want my pizza and theres a few veggies that are not stocked. The young man had to go and make more pesto and look for more mushrooms. I can only assume the morning crew did not do their job. So I pay for my pizza and go sit down at a dirty table, but every table is dirty, trash can is full and the windows haven't been cleaned in who knows how long. The pizza was good for the price that's paid and was cooked to perfection. I doubt I'll return just on the cleanliness and the looks of having to see employees smoking right in front of the establishment."}
{"text":"I went in at about 9:30 to get a pizza with a friend and they close at 10:00 when we walked in they were already cleaning with stuff pulled out and all that which I did not mind. while we were ordering the nicest guy made the pizza for us I think his name was Diego I could tell he was new but he was trying. Anyways the person helping him make the pizzas was so rude! Her name was Maria. She was the one to check us out and was continuously rude to us! The pizza was amazing but Maria was the one who ruined my experience my first time there."}
{"text":"I live in the area of Pieology!! I absolutely love going here. I read a few of the reviews that state they are frugal on some of the toppings. If u think u need more, just ask, they are more than happy to accommodate your request. My favorite is herb sauce, mozzarella, little bit of Gorgonzola, artichoke, olives, jalapeños, cilantro, sausage & pepperoni, now that is a pizza. I will usually eat half and save the rest for another day!!! I know I go here at least every other week!! LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"You will not regret giving this place a try and pretty sure you will be back!

Was soo excited to see they opened one in AZ and a plus that it was so close to me. Pieology was introduced to me in California and craved it, so as i said was super excited to see it in AZ. 

You build your own pizza and its less than $8 what more can you ask and unlike Pizza Studio they do not skimp on your unlimited toppings.

So give this place a try, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So three stars between my husband and I. My husband really liked this place, I on the other hand didn't. That's why I decided to split the difference to be fair. For me it wasn't what I was expecting/hoping for. Granted we stopped by the first week following their opening and I'm sure they were just getting used to it. The pie choices are limited (compared to other similar places I've been to) and the flavor did not impress me. Would I be back? Meh..."}
{"text":"As I entered the establishment was immediately greeted by Brittany. Being my first time here she was more than happy to go over the many different choices and types of toppings, dough, and sauces. Brittany was very helpful in creating a pizza that suits me. The pizza was the best I have had and will return again."}
{"text":"So good. Fast, fresh, and larger than the competition's. Please open a location at Norterra on I-17 and happy valley!!!"}
{"text":"We are fans of Pieology at Downtown Summerlin.  They are generous with the toppings and everything tastes fresh.  The thin crust can stand up to numerous toppings.    I do think that they need to wipe up the service line a bit more than they do.  Some of the employees have some personality and are especially pleasant and others are just okay.  I have never had a burnt pizza and we probably go to Pieology about once every ten days.  I would like them to have a frequent visitor card.  I wouldn't encourage you to drive across town for what is essentially a fast food place, but if you are in the area or live nearby, like I do, then it should be on your go to list for a quick and easy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza with all the toppings you want! And they don't charge extra for toppings on top of your toppings. Food comes fast. Pizza is always ready by the time I finish washing my hands."}
{"text":"Really good value for the price. I was surprised at how good the ingredients were. Only qualm is that service was pretty slow. It seemed like the servers could put the toppings on faster, esp when there's a line."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Pieology. I've had it in CA and also in Tucson. I'm so happy that it is finally in the phoenix area.  My favorite is the signature buffalo pizza but I always do half of something else like a classic margarita. I ve already been 3times and WILL be back soon."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and you can tell the kids that work there are trained to put and extra emphasis on customer service. Initially ordering was a little confusing."}
{"text":"This place is great ! First time in this location , the quality is supreme . The price is great for what your getting for sure . The guys who helped me and my boyfriend were Collin and Gus , they're customer service was top of the line , they were def welcoming and carried on conversation without making it seem like they're just doing their job . This place is awesome !"}
{"text":"I love that you can see what they are putting on it or you can make it your own way. Not expensive at all and you get a good size pizza. Employees were really nice, they just opened but they did good at knowing the menu. And they have the MOST delicious cinnamon pizza you will ever eat. I recommend this place 100%."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Crust is perfect. Just thin enough to have a crispy finish, but still soft on top."}
{"text":"Loved the veggie pizza. . Staff is super friendly. . They Manger was really amazing. .. enjoyed everything about this place. Food was excellent.  Fresh .employees ,made me feel very welcome.  All has smiles.   Look like they really enjoyed their jobs.. manager was  very friendly and super helpful.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this location . Employees are all amazing. Food was soooo yummy and will return for sure. Pizza was cooked perfectly and very tasty . Customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch.  I had never been to Pieology before.  It definitely gets added to the rotation.  What is Pieology?  It's Chipotle but with Pizza.    And it's good.  It's about 10 minutes to cook, you pick everything from sauce to cheeses to toppings."}
{"text":"Dirty Dirty location. One of the employees had Target be on the phone than clean the place. I won't be back to this location  Some pics attached"}
{"text":"Ordered the Classic Margherita pizza.  Order taker had to look and see what a Margherita pizza is.  Coached him through it and waited for what I have been told a great pizza.  Maybe next time.  Thin and chewy crust, though I like thin crispy crust.  Will have to try again because I don't totally judge on first effort.  Will be trying another store in Rancho Cuccamonga soon.  Caesar salad was big but lacked croutons and had lettuce turning brown underneath.  Really friendly service though."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast and I have been looking for a good pizza place since I moved here in June. I'm not saying this is typical east coast pizza but I am saying this was some of the best pizza (and coolest idea for a pizza place) I have ever had. Great atmosphere, quote wall has some inspirational sayings to read while you wait, and awesome employees.  Definitely worth a stop. Two thumbs up, y'all!"}
{"text":"I like that they use fresh local food to make their pizza's. The only thing that is shipped in from the home office are the gluten free crusts. You can put WHATEVER  you want on your pizza. The staff has the process down to where it moves pretty fast also. My husband I split a pizza and get two drinks for under $13.00, can't beat that.  Very clean , fresh food and happy staff."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Also a worker (Anthony) there knows sign language - very friendly!  Easy to place order there.  THANKS!"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good service was great. It is comparable to Mods Pizza and Fired pie. Food comes out quick which is always nice when you have a hungry child."}
{"text":"Walking into a place with the staff all greeting you in unison is definitely surprising, but so welcoming. I really appreciated the upbeat staff. They not only showed their excitement when you walked in, but also while you were ordering. The time from the door to the line to your seat to you eating ranged from 7-10 minutes. Now tell me when was the last time you ordered a custom pizza with as many toppings as you wanted and have it come out in 5 minutes and all for 7.95? I'll tell you never! Granted all the pizzas are thin crust and do have extra toasty edges, but hey you can't have it all. All in all I would recommend this place not only for the experience of having pizza chipotle style, but because the food is delicious."}
{"text":"The kitchen staff ignored me for a whole two minutes while I waited by the counter, when they finally noticed me, they just asked \"what do you want?\" Without saying hello or anything. I ordered, when my pizza came out of the oven, the crust was still uncooked, I asked them to put it back in for a few minutes, the server said it was \"fine\" and walked behind the kitchen door to avoid me.

Worst pizza place ever."}
{"text":"Met Sean recently and he was awesome. No complaints, all positive vibes. You're the man Sean !!"}
{"text":"Omg it's SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! I am a frequent visitor of blaze pizza on decatur, but when this place opened right by house I couldn't WAIT to try it!! I got a build your own pizza with garlic herb butter and Alfredo sauce instead of red. Then I added ricotta, feta, spinach, mushrooms, cucumbers, basil, carrots, tomatoes, pepperoni, sausage,  oregano, and salt and pepper. I brought it home and omg I'm so glad it's so close! The staff was super friendly and very attentive. And they cook the pizzas so fast no wonder there's no wait. I definitely recommend coming here to try their pizzas. It's a little bit more expensive then Blaze but not by much and in my opinion, it's worth it. The only thing I could recommend to this place is to PLEASE GET GOAT CHEESE FOR THE PIZZAS. Other then that it's perfect"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying not only are they greedy with their toppings but I was told it was the manager who tells their employees not to give the customers too much toppings when we ask for more. I'm pretty sure the advertisement says unlimited toppings, it's obviously false advertisement and they could easily be sued for it. It's extremely unprofessional.  I had a coupon a few weeks ago for buy one pizza get one free and it seemed like the manager was mad that I had the coupon and give me a lot of attitude. The pizza is good but the customer service is terrible!! They need to hire someone whose professional and knows how to run a business because this place is heading the wrong path already."}
{"text":"This is one of the few pizza places that offer vegan cheese on its pizza. I picked up a pizza to-go on the way home. I really enjoy how I can customize the pizza toppings to my taste for the same price. This place is a must for anyone who loves pizza."}
{"text":"My wife and I have become addicted to this place. 

We love the evening/weekend crew.

The district manager is even out making pizza and doing on the job training. This place has a great business model and it shows in the pizza and service.

Try a crustless pizza!"}
{"text":"Good pizzas. They made our pizzas fairly quick and had no problem giving me what I wanted. They even had my favorite apple juice! Everything we needed was available to us at the drink counter. It was nice that they have the pizza boxes there that you can take without having to wave down an employee just for a box. That was very convenient. 

Food was delivered to our table and the employee even went out of his way to grab us some ranch. 

I would come here again. 

Other than that one of our pizzas was a little toasty on the edges but it's not a big deal. It was still good."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in Pieology while writing this. The customer service was amazing and the food was great! A whole pizza, unlimited toppings for $8?!!!! I'm in! Thanks for a good lunch break!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, workers don't know what they are doing, manager wears sagging pants and stingy on topping. TOTAL RIPOFF!!!"}
{"text":"Man let me just say A W E S O M E!! Great pricing and amazing pizza! Exactly how you want to have a pizza and unlimited  .  Will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Yummmm!!!  I love getting to pick out all the toppings and flavors. Kiddo loved the cheese pizza and we had a blast customizing our own. Ingredients are fresh and many to pick from. Will definitely be back to make some more custom pizzas."}
{"text":"I have come to become a regular here, they have such a wide variety of toppings it never gets boring. The crust is amazing and their toppings are fresh. The price is awesome for what is available. The staff here is very courteous and friendly. The location is always clean and never too busy. We drove out of our way just to eat."}
{"text":"Great pizza with a great price! Two of us were gluten/dairy free, and the staff were very nice and accommodating. They were also careful about cleanliness - i.e. using a paper towel to open the fridge since they were touching food, etc. There was a big range of toppings, and we all enjoyed being able to have our own custom pizzas."}
{"text":"I had the gluten-free crust and BBQ sauce with my choice of toppings. I have to say if you like garlic, get extra garlic. The only thing I'd change is to leave my pizza in a couple minutes longer since I love the slightly charred taste to my toppings! I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time eating here. The pizza is yummy. The salad is very small for the price. But my issue is with the staff. Lots of staff yet customer service was poor. We have a severe milk allergy in the family so I went online to check allergens on the pizza before we had a birthday party there. The allergen guide indicated that the regular crust had milk, but the wheat crust did not. When we got there, I'm glad I asked. There was confusion with the staff on what did and did not contain milk. As it turns out, the wheat crust does have milk so we had to go with the gluten free crust at an extra $2.00 charge. The red sauce also had pieces of cheese floating in it, which was also an issue with the milk allergy, so we used BBQ sauce instead along with the non-dairy cheese. We ordered some side salads to go with the pizza and that was met with a sigh. I waited after I paid for the salads since no one asked what type of dressing we wanted. No one took the initiative to ask why I was still standing at the counter and just gave us salads with Italian dressing. I'm not sure we'll be back again. There are lots of places to get good pizza. Allergies can be very serious and this place obviously has not trained their employees properly to avoid exposure."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant it tastes good and the service is good cooking is fairly fast and the food comes out great and their desert pizza is delicious"}
{"text":"Good pizza, thin crust. Love the concept since I hang around a bunch of picky eaters... so everyone can get theirs exactly how they want it! Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Service has gone down hill in recent months. This place use to be better than Blaze, but based on recent experiences at Pieology I suggest going to Blaze. Pieology also emailed a promotion to it's \"members\" for $3.14 pizza on Pi Day, but this location refused to honor that deal. I won't be returning to Pieology."}
{"text":"Tried this place when it first opened and it was horrible, but as all places when they first open and arent upto par I decided to try it again....well its just that bad all the time. The place was dirty, the staff was rude especially the manager! My pizza was burnt even my teenage son didnt want to eat it after 2 bites. Save your money, a frozen pizza tastes better than this!"}
{"text":"Yummy, fast, lots of choices, friendly service and a good price. Very happy that there's a Pieology in Vegas now. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love love love their pizza. I have been to this place now twice in 3 days. Their gorgonzola buffalo chicken pizza is to die for."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Pieology and the pizza was fantastic! However, I felt like a nuisance visiting here because the female worker making my pizza seemed tired and annoyed at me. 

Me: Wow--everything looks good! I feel like a supreme pizza. Do you know what toppings are generally in a supreme pizza?

Female worker: (yawn) Just order what toppings you want. 

Me: (frantically scanning the menu) uhh--uhh. Mad to Meat You! 

Female worker: (yawn)

I quickly pulled out my phone and googled \"supreme pizza toppings\"

Me: Can you add olives, green peppers, and onions please?

Female worker: (yawn)

Me: Thank you so much!

Female worker: (yawn)

Overall, the pizza was really tasty. The price is very reasonable. I will definitely come back and give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Usually have a good experience except for 08/12/17 Basically my husband got the wrong pizza and drove back to return it. A customer by the register over hears the conversation and says if no one wants the pizza he would take it. They than hand the pizza over to him and the unbothered customer walked away with a free pizza. As my husband waits for the pizza they find the old pizza they had somehow misplaced. They look at it and throw it away. Point is check your pizza before you leave and customer service varies by staff."}
{"text":"I like making my own pizza and this place awesome if you like to do that! They will put more toppings on if you dont think it has enough, just ask! The pizzas are big and filling, definitely enough for one person! Alfredo sauce, butter and herb is how i like to start my pizza! You should try it! Service is awesome!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  We visit so much that it's getting embarrassing because everyone remembers us (haha).  The pizza has a great flavor and it's something that can please everyone in a group.  I like it a lot more than MOD Pizza - I think the flavor is better.  The staff is great.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our family went to Pieology and it was amazing! The manager,Mike, was wonderful and checked up on us during our meal asking how it was. It offers many choices and I can pick whatever I want and how much! At fired pie they limit and ration how much meat you can get. Also when in line, the girl talked to us kindly and offered advice on what to pick. Not only is the place great but the pizza is spectacular. The flavors are amazing and it's GREAT!!! Very family friendly and great for everything. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza similar type place.  Good service, build you own pizza was good, crust great if you like thin (which I do), service fast and friendly.  Soda machine was broken, but Iced tea works for me.  Fast food atmosphere, but for what you get, a good value."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza spot in Vegas. I drive all the way to Downtown Summerlin specifically for this place. I can get a gluten-free pizza with all the toppings of my choice, for just 10 bucks."}
{"text":"My first time trying the concept of build your own pizza and it was great ! The amount of variety and toppings were perfect . They have a simple part of the menu where you're able to order premade which is good. Salad and breadsticks are also available both cheesy and cinnamon. On top on a great selection the service was excellent. Everyone there was very attentive, nice and helpful . The only negative was the wait but the wait was worth it !"}
{"text":"Aimee Dunnuck does an AMAZING job at making your favorite pizza with a smile! She goes the extra mile to ensure everything is exactly how you like it! Thanks Aimee for a great experience! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just recently moved here from Colorado and saw this place down the road from my house..was eager to try and was not disappointed! The manager instantly greeted us and began making our food as the words came out of our mouths. Super delicious, fast, and good service. The trainee that helped make our food wasnt very enthusiastic, but not a big deal."}
{"text":"Came to this place based on a recommendation from a family member. We ordered a pizza and picked our toppings.  The pie was baked in matter of minutes and service was good. I would return and try other pies. The soda was excellent. Lol."}
{"text":"This is what I call pizza!
Took 6 minutes from ordering until the pizza was on the table.
Chose every ingredient myself, and got it exactly the way I wanted it.

They also have gluten-free pizza (not recommended for Celiacs, as they use the same oven and stuff) that tastes very good!

One price for all pizzas, no fuzz, just good food."}
{"text":"This location has fantastic customer service. I am so pleased with their attention to detail and courteous demeanour. If you are looking for a great pizza with amazing customer service, you have to come visit Pieology at this location!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Mediocre pizza.

Neat concept where you can customize your own pizza with unlimited toppings which is nice but because its fast service the pizza can only be so good.

My pizza came with some crusty burnt black stuff in the bottom (burnt cornmeal) and an extra piece of hair (see photo). Yuck!

Only go here for a quick fix.  Better Pizza anywhere else."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Amazing service. Mike the manager was present and super helpful. He greeted everyone when they came in and thanked everyone as they left. The food was delicious and just right for price. They suggested ideas and were very helpful. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"This is a Subway type of restaurant so it's \"assembly line \" food but it doesn't taste like it!
Our pizza was delicious and came out quickly -- and the price is great.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"I visited  Pieology today for the first time. While I was pleased with the variety and selection of toppings  I was totally turned off by the health standards of the restaurant and it's employees. The girl making the pizzas (who I was told was the manager) used a gloved hand to scoop out the toppings and toss them on each pizza. After she scooped out each topping she would wipe her glove on her filthy dirty apron and then stick it into the next topping. I watched her squirt Alfredo sauce on top of someones pizza, wipe excess off with her hand and then smear it around with her fingers,again wiping her hands on her filthy dirty apron. Disgusting. When I went for a drink, both the ice teas were open to the air. The lids were sitting on top of the machine. Gross"}
{"text":"I used to think Fired Pie was my favorite DIY pizza place, but this place may have replaced it. The pizzas seem slightly bigger, and the guys working here are super friendly and efficient. Pro tip: Sign up for their mailing list to get a free pizza for your birthday with the pie haze of another. Also, try the alfredo sauce - it's delicious. And if you don't think you'll like it, just get it on half your pizza."}
{"text":"This place doesn't read complaints on here at all or ones sent to their website. I gave this place another chance. It was 4pm. The place was empty, the staff was doing nothing and the tables were nearly all dirty.

We ordered 4 pizzas. They put them in at separate times but must have pulled them out at the same time. One was burnt, two were OK, one was way undercooked. Three of the four needed 50% more cheese."}
{"text":"Pieology is the subway of pizzas. You select your crust, sauce then toppings. They bake the pie for you in a few minutes tadaa your eating your custom made pizza. It was good food and service was good at this location as well."}
{"text":"The best! Fresh, fast and good for your wallet. Nuff said!! Well yelp wants me to write more. This place is clean, service is excellent, items are always fresh and waiting. The greatest thing is that you can see your pizza being prepared. Its not like these other places i tell you!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time in a Friday. Slow slow slow. Line out the door took 40 min to get to the front. Need more people need to be more organized. Food was great, employees were really great and friendly. 
I'll be back but just frustrated about speed."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Staff is always courteous. The food is fresh and if your in a hurry its the perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"Good experience all the way around.
Greeted by staff (Olivia?)promptly made the pie quickly and exactly as I asked.
Our office staff eats at different  pieology frequently wish it was this location.
5 stars and a couple of thumbs up to the staff here"}
{"text":"The taste of the pizza is quite good! To be honest, the staff is friendly but i guess that in the rush of things their upkeep of bathrooms and cleanliness they need to work a bit more. I just hope the kitchen is not such a mess!"}
{"text":"what a mess, the people couldn't spred out toppings to make the pizza even. lump of mushroom on one side lump of basil on the other, cheese wasn't even placed in I nice fashion. 2 of the 3 people working had no idea what they were doing. 

After me and 2 others sat down to wait they came to me and said they'd have to remake mine, and after watching the first attempt I didn't want them to even try to make another.
I asked for my money back and the cashier went to get manager who said I couldn't have my money back... He wasn't allowed to refund my money, what a joke of a buissness. while I sat pissed off and watching my friends tell me I wasn't missing anything because there food was pretty unedible, I decided to approach the cashier again and this time manager gave me my money back. Funny he couldn't the first time I asked. 
stay far far away from this place .
."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The best pizza I've ever had. I wish there was one near my house. Plus it's the only place to get Dr. Pepper near the hotel!  if you knew me, this matters to me. 

This pizza place is for all kinds of eaters, the foodie, the vegetarian, the picky eater & meat lover. Trust me, you'll love this place too!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place thoroughly. The idea of subway (put your sandwich together) but with pizza. Great selection of meats, cheeses, sauces to use for pizza.. just great. The service is good too. I'll usually eat in the store and the ambiance is nice. If you haven't checked out this place yet, you need to! The idea is awesome and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I come here with my family almost 2-3 times a week. My brother loves it we always get attended great."}
{"text":"Came here on friday The employee at the register was very nice so they get 2 stars for her but the other employees that are preparing the food talk super low and get frustrated when you ask them to repeat what they said. They put minimal cheese and I asked for extra green peppers and the guy literally put on like a little sprinkle. My younger niece in front of me asked for extra pepperoni and the guy seemed to get irritated  I didnt want to deal with him so we moved on just to get him out of our face.  We spent almost 50 bucks at this place and that's the service we get.... forget that we will never be back. I would rather go to little cesars"}
{"text":"I' been a loyal customer for months now at the summerlin location. But this one, I'm never coming back again. 

After I got home with my boxed Pizza. To my surprise the half of pizza is burn! Burn who does that, and why would you think it's acceptable to give it like this? Think by the time I got home and opened it you were close and I couldn't complain? 

Very disappointing to the quality of this experience."}
{"text":"Ok- work over at Hughes Center and go to the food court quite a bit. Went to Pieology to get my usual.  Hawaiian style w meatballs.  Simple - pineapple, ham, meatballs.  Pineapple skimpy had to ask for more. Ham- 4 pieces.  I was trying to get my Hawaiian on, can I get more ham?  She added one piece.  5 total. Put a meatball on. I asked for more, she made me feel like a loser saying there is a limit.  So I said.  Ok. Add some sausage.  WTF?   Last Pieology for me.  You guys suck!   I am now going to Blaze Pizza on eastern avenue near anthem.  Not happy with this place.   Pass.  Try Habit or Chipotle"}
{"text":"Same concept as Blaze Pizza on Decatur. Great array of toppings. Crust is good although tends to be doughy in the middle. Good salad choices including make your own. Overall very good. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service.

Very quick quality pizza with customer toppings.  Would love to see them have turkey sausage and/or turkey pepperoni options."}
{"text":"It was pretty good, but they did not clean the oven between our pepperoni pizza and a dessert pizza so we tasted some sweetness on some of our crust. It wasn't bad but it shows inconsistencies. I give them a 6-7 out of 10 depending on the slice. It's conveniently near Costco and is a step up from Costco's pizza but their process of producing the pizzas needs big improvement if you are a picky eater."}
{"text":"I love the custom personal pizza concept, and Pieology does it very well.

My main basis of comparison is Fired Pie, which I also recommend. What is different about Pieology?

1. I felt like the employees wanted my pizza to be just how I wanted it. They made sure I was happy with the amount of meatballs and asked if it looked right before and after baking it.

2. The pizza, although still thin crust, seemed like a much more substantial meal. Part of it is 11.5\" versus 11\" in the base size, and part of it is the amount of toppings used. Fired Pie workers will only put a certain amount of toppings on a pizza for cost and balance reasons. Pieology put noticeably more toppings on my pizza, even though I am sure they have a limit, too.

I got a filling, customized personal pizza for under $10 after tax, and it was prepared with great friendliness. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The manager is really nice every time we have come in, but there is a serious need for customer service training. Young women behind the counter were joking around with one another while trying to take our order which was incredibly frustrating as they were not listening to my answers to their questions. I had to repeat myself a few times because they were not giving me their undivided attention. I have to say Mod Pizza is an overall better experience."}
{"text":"This pizza is definitely some decent thin pizza in Vegas, but it is still not my favorite. 

I love that this place has custom built pizza with unlimited toppings for such a low price. $8 is a great deal in Summerlin. 

With that said, I would still prefer to order a pizza from a chain, and it would be cheaper.

I made the mistake of getting the garlic-butter-olive oil combination as my base (I am not the biggest fan of sauce). The employee basically poured it on. Boy, was it overwhelming. When you got a lot of the roasted garlic in your bite, it was very sweet. Not my favorite. It would be better in a much smaller quantity. 

The pizza was well cooked. I liked the cheeses and pepperoni.

I was that they hand stretched their dough like at Project Pie. The crust here felt very storebought. I like that they have the gluten free option. 

My favorite thing about this pizza was that unlike Settebello and 800 Degrees, everything doesn't slide off when you pick up a slice. That gets very annoying.

Overall, not a bad place, but I won't be making a special trip for it."}
{"text":"Seems great although it sucked that there wasnt a child changing table in the womans bathroom and i had to lay out my sweater on the bathroom floor to change my sons diaper. Pizza seemed good had a atmosphere similar to chipotle but with pizza."}
{"text":"Great mixes of sauces, cheeses, and oh my toppings. Short wait time, great price (9 bucks?), and staffs are every friendly. The pizza came out a lot better than I anticipated. Can't wait to come back and try different mixes."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Busy night.  Staff walked away in the middle of making a pizza n started sweeping.  Left a dessert pizza in the oven and forgot to bring it. Not prepared for a crowd"}
{"text":"This was previously a 5 star review, but changed it since they started deceiving people out of money. Customers don't like that. The way they do it is the front clearly shows the flat rate price for the pizza so that's what you think you're getting, but they then ask you what type of crust you want, but at least one of the crusts is $1+ additional, but they won't tell you that- they hide their intention to charge you more. Then they will try to do more add-ons at the register, for example, they sometimes automatically add a drink even if you don't order one and suggest that it's 'included' even though it is not. Obviously their goal is to get $2+ more out of you. Customers are aware of these sleazy marketing tactics and hate companies who deceive people. What they're doing is unethical and hopefully they will learn once they get enough complaints."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC pizza experience. I got a custom pizza and Evan made sure all the toppings were to my liking. It tasted super yummy! Sabrina showed great customer service when it came time to pay for my order. I love it here because the employees show that they actually care about what they're doing."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza with a great thin crust! The line can be a little long because it takes time for people to pick out their toppings but the pizza comes out quickly once you have ordered and the staff is always very sweet and kind. The fresh basil, pepperoni and garlic pizza with watermelon tea is awesome!"}
{"text":"Disappointed and not impressed. No flavor..from the pizza to the ranch dressing. Not even after loading it with seasonings. Staff didn't remember what was supposed to go on the Alfredos Alfredo. Decent price for 12 in...if it actually tasted good. Female cashier was friendly. Blaze and other quick fix pizza places are better. Definitely NOT #flavafull."}
{"text":"Save your money and go to little caesars.... you are paying for overpriced burned pizza."}
{"text":"Best gluten-free pizza around! Period. Staff knows how to serve Deaf clientele! Very Deaf friendly restaurant 
Two of the servers communicated in ASL with me. Very impressive first impression!!! We will definitely be back. 

Wife used to prefer Mod Pizza in Avondale but now this is her new fav!"}
{"text":"The pizza toppings are the best. You can build your own for one price, not like $2 each additional topping, like at other places. You can have just vegetables or all meats or multiple cheeses. They are pretty and colorful when they come out of the oven too."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. However,  the pizzas were just \"OK\". I asked for red sauce on the side for my Margherita pizza and it was cold. The oven had too much charred crust that for all over my hands when eating my pizza. Other than that, it was a 3 rating. KC"}
{"text":"We had lunch for the first time recently and will be back regularly. The staff were friendly and patient as we waded through the great selection of sauces, cheeses and toppings. Everything was fresh and tasty. the gluten free crust was crisp and tasty. there were 11 of us and the large table was perfect for our large group."}
{"text":"Very friendly employees.  The original pizza crust was nice and crunchy.  They have a good variety of toppings for pizza and salads."}
{"text":"Living in the area, we have driven by 'Pieology' off Greenfield & Baseline numerous times and wanting to try it.  Last night as my wife was working late and our son visiting we went there.  The concept is like 'Chipotle' but for pizza.  Starting the line you get one size 11' pizza and they make it with your choice of toppings all for the same price.  I got quite a few items and each was fairly generous with the amount of topping.  They gave me both a senior and military discount so two pizza's and two drinks were $17 and change which I thought was a great deal.  Finding a table about 8 minutes later our pizzas were delivered. In a word both were 'excellent' and with all the toppings I struggled to finish mine but I'd had little lunch and was hungry.  I could have eaten half of it and been satisfied - I noticed a few older couples were splitting one pizza because they loaded a lot of toppings on them.  Though I did not use they had these cool little take home rectangular boxes that would hold about half a pizza.  BTW the Staff and Manager were very courteous and during breaks in the line were out on the dining floor cleaning up the area.  I have to give this place a '5 star' and would go 6 stars on Yelp if I could.  I read the less favorable reviews but in my experience the pizza crust was great, pie fully cut, and staff about a friendly as it gets.  In future I plan to only get pizza here as I think it is the best pizza deal going...JGH"}
{"text":"The idea of a Chipotle-style, point-and-choose-what-you-want pizza place is pretty cool, but I'm not a big fan of this place. The pizza tastes good, but the crust is too thin for my taste (but if you like cracker thin pizza, you'll love this place). Also, it took up to 20 minutes for us to get our food."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. I like the crust to be a little crispy. They need to cook the pizza for longer. I love how they have the different types of crust whole wheat, gluten free and regular. They have good options to build your pizza.  Employees were nice and very helpful. Parking lot is not very good it gets really packed!"}
{"text":"I was very skeptical about coming here but I'm glad my gf took me coz I would of never experience how frat these pizzas are. You can put as many toppings and sauces as you want at no extra charge!"}
{"text":"Very nice - ordered via Door Dash and was quite pleased.  Build your own pizza - tasted very fresh - nice, thin crust.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Amazing custom pizza for such a good price (11.5\" for $8). Lots of toppings and options. And all unlimited. And the pizza tastes great. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Best Pizza!!! So grateful there is one here in AZ! Would recommend this place to everyone and when friends come to visit from out of town, they love visiting here as well. Excellent customer service always!!! Thank you Pieology :)"}
{"text":"Would have been 4 stars for food quality but they don't have a diaper changing area in their bathroom and that can make a pleasant dinner into a terribly inconvenient and annoying one. Get a diaper change area in your bathroom, your restaurant is frequented by families with small children."}
{"text":"We just tried this place out for the first time. The concept of creating your own pizza is fun and for only $7.95 with unlimited toppings, it's cheap too.  Not the most amazing pizza, but tasty. Ryan took our order, explained the process, and checked on us after we sat down. He had amazing customer service and I would not be surprised if he is running the place one day. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best places where you can pick and choose what you want on your pizza !"}
{"text":"Very interesting way to have a pizza. Staff is too notch and customer service is very professional. The pizza was AMAZING, and the cost is very reasonable for all that you get. They have a system that seems to be working. You won't be disappointed by your experience. Definitely recommend giving Pieology a visit."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at pieology today, mostly because Gavin and Joshua were so polite! The pizza was also delicious, like always"}
{"text":"Chipotle-style ordering for pizza. I love the concept and I love their pizzas. The thin crust pizza filled with sauce and toppings of your choice really hits the spot. The price of the pizza also is very reasonable as it come out to be less than $8. The staff is super friendly/helpful with their customers that I couldn't help not give them a tip. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the valley's best pizza and best employees this is it. The manager Mike made my family feel at home. The pizza was phenomenal, the atmosphere was great, and the hospitality was top notch. I suggest this place to all my friends and family. Keep up the good work and I look forward to enjoying another visit ."}
{"text":"I must say I was very surprised how the great pizza was... Same concept as chipotle but with pizza...

My wife and I wanted to duplicate a California pizza kitchen barbecue chicken pizza and I must admit it was dead on fantastic!

We went with the thick crust which was a good move double chicken, double cilantro, Red onion, with a herb butter shmear on the crust, Some ricotta, and the barbecue sauce drizzled on top...

The pizza was actually large enough for the two of us... And they had this most wonderful watermelon ice tea... Definitely coming back... This place is a winner...

The wife gave it four stars I gave it 4 1/2 actually 4 7/8 that's why I posted five stars"}
{"text":"Good pizza, but standing in line for 30 min with 5 people in front of me while their are no pizzas in the oven and 3 sitting their ready to put in for 20 min. Very frustrating when you sit and watch while laugh and take their precious time. Their management and leadership is failing to set a simple standard. Won't come back again"}
{"text":"Probably just wrong expectation...the thin crust is too thin. They machine press the crust instead of flipping it so the crust is super dense and way too chewy. They put very little toppings so it almost looked as if I was eating crackers. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great value and fresh ingredients. This locations dining room could be a little cleaner but the staff is very nice!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, huge topping selection. Absolutely awesome. Customer service was incredible. Wish I could remember all the names but the 2 who stood out where Colin and Josh, some of the best customer service I have ever received!"}
{"text":"Apparently creating your own pie is no longer a thing; I told them I wanted buffalo sauce on my pizza and they proceeded to make something that I didn't order.  My wife had already paid or I would have walked out.

Blaze is opening soon - this place won't be getting my business again."}
{"text":"My family really loved Pieology!  For $7.95, you build your own custom 11\" pizza. Perfect for us since we all like something different on our pizza.  
No extra charges for each topping, same price, no matter what you want on your pizza!  It's a very thin crispy crust.  My one complaint would be that they should turn the pizza at least once while in the oven.  I noticed on all 6 of our pizzas that one half was burnt at the edge; it was the half that was closest to the fire in the oven. If they turned the pizza at least once, they would cook more evenly and avoid the burnt crust.  And $2.95 for a fountain drink seems high, but I guess they have to make money somewhere ;-)
The staff was friendly, the store was clean and the food was delicious.  We will definitely visit this Pieology again.  Would love to see a location in North Las Vegas; Summerlin is a long drive for us, so we don't eat here as often as we would like."}
{"text":"Such good pizza and so many toppings to choose from! I was so happy to have whole wheat crust while my husband got regular. The crust was thin and crispy and the staff was super friendly and helpful! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed that this location did not have vegan cheese. Also, their gluten free crust is okay, but definitely not the best I had. It was a little too soft in my opinion."}
{"text":"The pizzas are great, the price is reasonable, restaurant is clean, and the customer service is outstanding, especially from Zach!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Pieology for the first time with friends recently and was really pleased with the selection and taste of the pies. For a set price you can pick your crust, base sauce and toppings, regardless of the amount and variety. The pizzas are made to order and placed in the oven for maybe 5-10 minutes.  There are gluten-free options as well for those that need.  

Overall I'd have to say I'm a fan of Pieology now and will return in the future.  Staff is friendly and efficient. It was a relatively quiet late afternoon so the wait was negligible.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Isaac had excellent customer service he even tried up selling me a couple times.... good job !!! He deserves a raise or promotion"}
{"text":"Outstanding! 

Great service, food, and the price were bot too shabby. 

I hate thin pizza, but the pizza came out perfect. Turned me around on thin crust. Toppings tasted fresh, and the unlimited option they offer on toppings is awesome."}
{"text":"Pieology vs Fired Pie. A lot people seem to be wondering this.

WHY NOT BOTH!? Here's some things I love about Pieology that Fired Pie kind of lacks in.

1. Supportive, yet perfectly thin, crispy yet tender crusts! Pieology wins here in that the crust perfectly supported the generous amount toppings I had on my Buffalo Chicken pizza (which was bomb, see photo attached). The crusts at Fired Pie are consistently pretty soggy in the middle, and tends to fall apart, considering all of toppings I like to request on my 'zas. By the way, when I asked for a lot of mushrooms at Pieology, they offered me A LOT of mushrooms. They went out of their way to make sure I had enough! Sparse topping hiccups are definitely gone, seems like.

2. Larger store, more seating, more space to yourself! Fired Pie at the 101 tends to feel pretty claustrophobic since it's soooo small and is typically packed. It's kind of like being crammed in someone's living room with 50 other people. Sometimes I don't want to eat right next to a gaggle of screaming kids, and Pieology's large layout allows me to head to a corner and inhale my food in peace.

3. HERB BUTTER OLIVE OIL BASE:  Just go ahead and drown me in this. So buttery, so good. Add the gorgonzola too, it's ridiculously good.

There are some toppings and sauces that Fired Pie has that Pieology doesn't. And I'll be going back there occasionally when I'm in that area (especially if it's not currently jam packed with tiny screaming people) but I'm SO glad Pieology opened, because they are just as great and in a few ways better, so the real question is... WHY NOT BOTH?!"}
{"text":"My favorite fast casual pizza joints. 1/2 Buffalo & 1/2 Margarita was bomb. Probably the best margarita pizza in Chandler."}
{"text":"This place is the best place for personal pizzas. You even have a choice for wheat bread which I really like."}
{"text":"Good place for a personal pizza where you can put as many toppings on as you like. They have a gluten free crust that is very good. Even if it does come in frozen. 

Unfortunately this location unlike the one on Howard Hughes does not give discounts of any kind."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time for the Monday deal night 5 personal pizza! Loved the crust and endless toppings. Great value and quality. The manager checked me out, signed me up the coupons and deals. Very nice guy and answered a my questions. Definitely will be back for great pizza and awesome customer service. Thank you Pieology!"}
{"text":"I love Pieology's Pizzeria! They really do give unlimited toppings all for one affordable price. Other pizza place will charge extra per topping. I like how this location is so convenient, it neighbors other fast food eateries in the Hughes Center and there is sufficient parking space. The entrance is set up as a long walkway to form a single line; there's a divider that separates the dining area. When it does get busy it will feel like waiting in line for a buffet, but the wait time is manageable. They do have a wall of inspirational quotes that will keep a person's mind entertain with wisdom and it's a nice token of remembrance. 

The best part is creating your own pizza and they make the process real simple. You choose your type of dough, original or thick crust. It's an extra dollar for Pierise Thick Crust, but I always go for the House-Made Original ($8.49). Then you pick your sauce, type of cheese, whatever veggie toppings you like, your choice of meat, and you have the option to add sauce after the pizza is bake. In addition, they offer freshly made Signature Salads, Ooey Gooey Cheese Bread, and Cinnamon Churro Pizza. 

I started with the house-made original dough, added a mix of house red sauce and fiery buffalo sauce, mozzarella and gorgonzola cheese, then chose all veggie toppings including spinach, basil, cilantro, roasted red pepper, garlic, black olive, pineapple, marinated artichoke, mushroom, and grape tomato. The meat options they offer are Canadian bacon, meatball, spicy Italian sausage, all-natural chicken, and salami. The pizza is served piping hot with a nice crispy thin crust. It's almost like having a fun snack for one person. 

They only have one dessert on the menu, which is the Cinnamon Churro Pizza ($2.99). You can have the pizza with or without chocolate chips, but I prefer the topping. It's a simple pizza dough that is sprinkled with cinnamon, baked in the oven, drizzled with a cream sauce and topped with tiny morsels of chocolate chips. It's like eating a crispy thin chocolate chip churro with cream frosting, and it taste better than a pop tart. It would be great if they offer more variety like chocolate chip cookie, chocolate fudge brownie, and pie toppings like M&M, snicker, kit kat, and peanut butter jelly. 

Even when it gets busy, I notice the staff takes great pride working efficiently as a team, delivering good quality and fast service. When I come by to order a pizza, the staff is so accommodating and polite. Yes, the lines do get long sometimes but keep in mind that each pizza may take at least 10 to 15 minutes to bake. And if you want to save some pizza for leftover, they have a small take-out box available next to the soda fountain."}
{"text":"Triple cheese pizza my a@& I chose the alfredo pizza. My pizza didn't look anything like the one on the picture. This spot was great when it was Project Pie. MGM Grand lost a good pizza joint. Cheap ingredients and over priced. Much better pizza and prices anywhere else."}
{"text":"What can I say one of the only places that could satisfy a round table craving what an excellent idea they've become a fav for myself personally"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here before my wife and I hit the road home. 

The restaurant open right when we pass by. Everything was fresh and clean. Workers here are nice and friendly. Service was very quick.

Build your own pizza. So basically you can tell  them what topping to put on your pizza for one price."}
{"text":"This is another of the make-your-own wood fired pizza joints so popular right now (like Blaze). You start with three crust options (thin, thick, or gluten-free), continue by choosing your sauce (tomato, garlic basil, Alfredo, ...) and cheese (mozzarella, blue, parmesan, ...), then you choose your toppings from a huge selection of options. They place it in the brick oven and bring it to your table within minutes. Salads are also available.

The restaurant was clean, the food was great and filling, the were prices reasonable ($7.95/pizza), and the employees were kind."}
{"text":"Great tasting choices for gluten-free vegan pizzas that taste great! GO, YOU GOTTA TRY IT! And they have veteran's discounts."}
{"text":"My friend was curious to try this after she read good reviews about the pizzeria in California online and I agreed to go with her as it was located in Downtown Summerlin. When we first walked up to the location, a friendly gentleman by the name of Mike greeted us and explained that Pieology was similar to Chipotle but all about Pizza. As soon as he said this I got really excited as I'm a fan of Chipotle and the idea of customizing my own pizza is a lot more awesome than a burrito bowl. Since all custom pizza's no matter how you make it are $7.95, I did a pizza with olive oil, red sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, ham, pineapple, mushrooms and pepperoni. Considering it was their Grand Opening, the service was fast and baking the pizza did not take very long. After paying and grabbing our sodas, we sat down and had our pizza delivered straight to our table like any other pizza joint. 

This was my first time ever trying thin crust pizza as I'm a handmade deep dish pan kind of gal but it was good. The crust was a little burnt for my liking but for thin crust I assume that is normal and the flavors were great. I was even full after 4 slices and able to take the other 4 slices home in a box for later. 

On our way out, Mike stopped us and asked how it was, I explained how I was disappointed that white sauce, my favorite is not offered and he said that it will be coming soon. Now, here is the best part to Pieology. Later the night when I was feeling hungry I decided to give my pizza leftovers a try, heated it up and wow it still tasted great! Usually I hate leftovers because they never have the same taste as when the food is made fresh in a restaurant however pizza, always does and Pieology completing this fact made me happy and feeling satisfied for the price I paid of \"2 meals\" for $7.95 before tax. That is pretty awesome if you ask me. So if you're in the area and craving pizza definitely give Pieology a visit! :)"}
{"text":"Fast and Friendly Service. I love the unlimited toppings. Pizza was delicious!!!! First time here and I love it!!!"}
{"text":"So I would have given this place 5 stars, but they recently started skimping on the cheese! Love their gluten free option. More cheese!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, even better service . Two thumbs up guys !  Ordered a customized pizza and not only was it absolutely delicious but it came out in a timely matter. I do recommended sticking to a few ingredients opposed to choosing every single one just because it's free toppings . Trust me you'll enjoy your pizza more by not overloading your pizza"}
{"text":"Honestly I was very surprised at how good this pizza was and the employees were very nice and quick. All three pizzas we got were delicious. Their normal thin crust is really good, and I usually am not a huge fan of thin crust. I got the BBQ chicken pizza with extra barbecue sauce on top and it was great. Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"First experience today with my childs class ,was a great experience! !! Clean , friendly customer service they were so patiant with me ,,, made me a chicken pesto pizza wich i never had, was great!!!! Gotta try more from this place n so should you !"}
{"text":"Went to Pieology after hearing many good things about it from my brother who lives in California and has eaten at the chain quite a few times. 

When we arrived, the place was still rather lively despite being a half hour before closing on a weekday. The employees were very friendly and kindly made our food for us. Even though we had arrived close to closing, they put no pressure on us to \"hurry up and get out\". We were willing to take our food to go but they insisted that we dine-in if we preferred. 

We paid about 9 bucks for a custom bbq chicken pizza that my boyfriend and I split. It was very tasty and the only thing I didn't like was there was too much BBQ sauce around the edges, which made things a little messy. Regardless, that's an easy fix and I'll make sure to point it out to the person making my pizza next time. 

Overall, a very fun, cheap, and tasty place to go to if you are in the mood for pizza and don't want to share. My favourite part of this experience is that you can get as many toppings and cheeses as you want. My friend got every type of cheeze they had to offer. It was INSANE...and delicious."}
{"text":"Strikes a perfect balance between price, convenience and quality... Love coming here for a pie. 
Customized toppings for any pizza mood... Delicious!
I always ask for my pie well done to get a little extra crispness and char on the crust."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza at a really good price. Can't beat that! After a long day of shopping or a quick lunch, Pieology is the place to go. Pieology has a really great concept, similar to Chipotle or Subway where you pick your toppings and after paying, they pop it in the oven for several minutes and deliver the pizza to your table. For the most part, the toppings are unlimited for only $8. The pizza is large and the price is such a steal!

I ordered a spicy buffalo pizza with a lot of veggies and feta cheese. It was an interesting combo, but tasted great! Next time, I may try a combo that they recommend. Yelpers must note that the spicy buffalo chicken is pretty spicy!

The veggies tasted fresh, but I may ask for extra cheese next time since it wasn't super cheesy. The crust is thin so even though the pizza is large, I was able to eat most of it. You can also request ranch dressing from the cashier which is a necessity whenever I eat pizza!

This is a great concept, great prices, and good pizza! A recipe for a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here every so often because they are pretty fast and delicious. Even when the line is long it moves pretty quickly, so don't be discouraged if it is backed up to the entry. We always get custom pizzas because they are one price for however many toppings you want. There are plenty of toppings to choose from, and three or four different sauces as well. Overall I give it four out of five pepperonis!"}
{"text":"Not a fan.

Kitchen was a MESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.

TVs were blaring with very violent UFC fight on ... not family friendly.

Pizza was swimming in water - I guess they don't drain the vegis before making.

The concept is cool ... this location is not."}
{"text":"The servers seem to be having an off day. No greeting but once started the service and pizza were good"}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times. Love the fire grilled pizza and lots of toppings for make it yourself. The staff is always extremely nice. The music is upbeat and a great atmosphere for fun eating. Lunch is pretty busy but we seem to beat the crowd. Went for lunch today, the cashier was nice and had great customer service :)"}
{"text":"Customizable pizzas in minimal time is not a novel concept: several chains with this style have sprung up recently and I kind of had higher hopes for Pieology. Their featured pies list is small, but the emphasis is obviously on designing your own dinner. 

Last time I did this, at another chain, I designed something less than delightful, so I decided to play it safe with the Smokin' Buffalo Chicken. \"Blazin' Buffalo\" has a better ring to it, but I digress.
Pie was topped with olive oil (seemed unnecessary), mozzarella and a scant sprinkle of (flavorless) gorgonzola, plain chicken (spicy was also available but not offered?), a ton of red onion slices (a second glance verifies they aren't in the menu description), sub mushrooms instead of cilantro, and add on a buffalo-sauce drizzle after a trip to the oven. As far as taste: the cheese was sort of flavorless, buffalo sauce flavor was dominant, the crust was almost cracker-like with it's crispness. Kind of \"meh.\"

Staff is in need of training. Didn't see a manager around, the assembly-line seemed confused about whether I wanted the buffalo or barbecue pizza (hence the inclusion of the obnoxious amount of red onion), and the guy I interacted with most was extremely soft-spoken: I had to ask him to repeat everything because I couldn't hear him over the music. 
Mildly annoyed that no one offered to remake my pie when they realized they were adding the barbecue ingredients instead of the buffalo ones- the giant slices of red onion were a turn off and not supposed to be on the pie at all, but I pointed this out and it was not corrected.

A good, cheap option in the Downtown Summerlin area- $8/meal is not bad, especially considering you should have leftovers. If I come back, I'll try a pesto-pepperoni creation."}
{"text":"Use to love this place because i could put cranberries on my pizza but today I came here and they said there were no cranberries for me although I did see them as an option for a salad but not for my pizza. Pretty sad they have them in the back but absolutely cannot give me any to put on my pizza even tho that is why I use to come here. Oh well maybe I will find another place that won't be assholes about cranberries"}
{"text":"First time here and thought it was actually pretty good. I liked the thin crispy crust"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out today since we've heard good things about it! 

We both really liked the fact that it's a \"build your own pizza\" place. You pick out what type of sauce and cheese you want as well as all the toppings, and it only takes a five to ten minutes for the pizza to be brought to your table! 

We both wanted different toppings and the lady who took our order was happy to make a half and half pizza for us. The 11.5\" pizza was only 8 dollars, and it tasted great! I liked the thin crust bread, it wasn't too crispy. 

They have little to go boxes set up by the refreshments counter just in case you don't finish your pizza. 

Overall it was a great experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy is the word for this friendly place.  Mike was awesome, friendly and helpful. Really cared about his customers.  Something sadly rare these days   Food was excellent. Great value, fresh ingredients, friendly staff and clean.  What more could you ask for?  We hope they're around a long time."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Unlimited toppings and it's all done really fast. The people who work here were awesome, they were very nice and helpful. I've been coming here for about 4 years now, every time I visit Vegas and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Customer service is great, Veggies are fresh and you can customize your pizza to what you like! Gluten free options available too! Try it out!"}
{"text":"It's 1130am on a Monday, I enter the store listed above and see 3 people ahead of me. There is only one person making the pies and one other employee just watching near the cash register waiting for the person who ordered the last pizza. This process is extremely slow. It took about 17 mins to get to make my pie. Went through the whole process, only to find that they don't take any bill over $20. All I had was a $50 and a $5. Not anywhere in the store does it say that. What a waste of time for just an average pizza to boot. Never going there again. There's so many places to get better pizza. Just that this place is closest to my apartment. Skipping pieology from now on and going to places that actually like $50 bills."}
{"text":"This is a great concept, you custom build your pizza from the ground up, starting with the dough, the sauce the cheeses and the toppings. We ordered a pizza with bacon, sausage, meatballs, black olives, mushrooms and cheese. The finished product was very good, however, the crust was burned around the edges. 
One suggestion I would offer is that it would be nice if they provided paper plates."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! I love the customer service the staff is attentive and friendly, we were in there 2 days in a row and one of the pizza makers recognized us and was like welcome back, I told her that we loved Pieology and the first time we had it was in California and were hoping they got one here, she told us they were opening up 2 more locations in Vegas. The thing I love the most is the freshness of the pizza, you build it with fresh ingredients and when you taste them you can tell the difference in their pizza and the processed stuff you find in other pizza places. The restaurant is always clean, and stocked. The pizza makers bring out your hot n fresh pizza and even walk around to see if you need anything. I love the atmosphere of this place and you can't beat a 11.5 inch pizza with all the toppings your heart desires for 7.95!! There is not one negative thing I could say about this place it's that great!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place with high expectations as I love the idea of being able to customize your own pizza! Service was pleasant and fast but the pizza was less than desirable. It tasted very similar to a pizza you would buy at the grocery store in the frozen section and bake at home. I didn't notice anything special. It wasn't the worst pizza but certainly didn't live up to my expectations. 
Overall I would give the pizza a 5 on a 1-10 scale. There is certainly better pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you're a pizza lover this place is a must!

You start out by picking if you want olive oil or butter on your crust (Hint: olive oil = crispy crust and butter = soft crust). You then pick what type of sauce you want for the base followed by the kind of cheese (you can pick more than one). Next comes the veggie toppings and finished off by the kind of meat you would like on it. The great thing about this place is the unlimited toppings! So far I have been here 3 times and have had a different combination that was totally satisfying each visit. If it's your first time and you're not too sure about what to get they do have a popular pizza menu you can choose from. They do have individual packaged salads which honestly two people could really share."}
{"text":"The pizza was good. I made my version of a Hawaiian pizza with Canadian bacon, spinach, mozzarella and red sauce. It was simple and good. 

It's basically a chipotle for pizza. 

It was quick and didn't feel super greasy. Portions were not too overwhelming big or too small. Ended up taking two slices home."}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza both the standard selection and make your own. We did both.  Very simple concept that really works. $8 per pizza 12\".  Neither one of us could finish. Went at lunch time,  running with 4 people works like a champ. From start of line to pizza in hand no more than 10 minutes if that.  For bay area fans of Amicia this hands down give them a run for for the money. Pun intended."}
{"text":"Pieology Pizzeria is one of the best pizzas, you could choose the ingredients. Customer service is good ."}
{"text":"It's worth the $8 they charge for it.  I'd say it's the next step up from a $6 frozen pizza.  It's kind of fun that they make it right it front of you, but don't expect greatness for $8.  The location is new and clean.  As they said in Boogie Nights, \"it is what it is.\"  HAHA"}
{"text":"I love Pieology, but this location sucks. No one in the staff smiled or seemed happy to be there. They give you such a limited amount of toppings, and when I asked for more the woman helping me seemed irritated. I'm a paying customer and would have no problem paying for extra. I stood at the register waiting to pay without being acknowledged, and the employee had their back to the register and did not help me until another employee on break yelled hey someone is waiting on you. The whole staff needs to find a new job if they don't want to help people and know how to treat customers. I will continue going to the Summerlin location because I've never had that problem there."}
{"text":"I was the first customer of the day this morning and explained to the young man Aaron that I had Celiac and needed to be completely gluten free and that I was worried about my pizza touching another in the oven.  This young man went above and beyond to make sure there was no cross contamination and that we had a great dining experience.  I was very impressed.  This was my first dining out experience since my diagnoses and I was very nervous because I've heard that restaurants do not understand or take Celiac seriously.  Aaron most certainly did."}
{"text":"This is the second time being here and I can't get enough of it! The selection and amount of variety that you can get all in one place is honestly a pizza lovers heaven! The thing that honestly gets me as well as the amazing food is the great service! Everyone is so friendly, patient, and helpful with anything you need! This place is great and the people that work there are as amazing as the food! I'll continue to return to this place time and time again! Pieology you the real MVP!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this spot out again after a very disappointing first visit when they first opened. I was hoping they were able to work out the kinks by now, but I was so, so wrong.  Soggy crust, colorless meat with a unappetizing flavor. You might as well get a Tostinos frozen pizza and cook it in the microwave. 

How can Fired Pie get it right every time, and Pieology fails so hard?"}
{"text":"$5 pizza Monday's!!!! And since I checked into yelp I got a free drink! And for a $1 more you can get thick crust! I recommend getting one of the signature pizzas but you can always create your own!"}
{"text":"When paying $10 for a pizza I expect better than this. I feel like I paid just the box because the pizza was so tiny. Disappointed. Do better, Pieology!"}
{"text":"So it appears pretty new so they were still working out some organization kinks.   However the manager working there tonight was cool calm and collected even when some orders were mixed.   Hes a diamond and the reason i will return despite the extended wait time"}
{"text":"A few co-workers & I have been trying all the different \"build it yourself pizza\" joints in town. Stopped in on Friday for lunch with a few co-workers.Wait was about 10 minutes to get up to the register to order. They don't seem to be skimpy with the toppings like Pizza Rev. Crust wasn't that flavorful in my opinion. But with the ability to put lots of toppings on it I was able to get some good flavor out of the pie. Venue is extremely loud when you get a few people in there due to the open ceiling layout & nothing to absorb the noise so it was a bit annoying to have to shout across the table to each other. Location is a bit far to travel to from my work so won't be going there much. Plus I think Blaze Pizza tastes better. An \"A-OK\" review since they don't skimp on the toppings."}
{"text":"Pizza is pizza is pizza, but pieology pizza is crack. 

I honestly have the time of my life eating pieology because I like thin crust and i like my ingredients super specific. For sauces, i recommend herb butter + basil pesto. its oily but sooo good"}
{"text":"Love Pieology, hate this location in Las Vegas. Don't have the same offers as in LA! Staff is also a no go, super rude!"}
{"text":"I was here a few hours ago with my husband. Originally we thought about stopping at Habit Burger next door. Since there was no seating available,  we went to Pieology instead. Very empty and fast service. It's rare to run into a pizza joint that offers unlimited toppings! Yes you read that correct. They don't even hesitate if you ask for more. The workers are great and prompt. Nice alternative to what's available on the Strip."}
{"text":"My experience here didn't pan out the way I'd hoped. The workers are nice but the pizza is just bad. Mine was anyway. For under $8 you can customize your pizza with unlimited toppings. They make the pizza right in front of you so you see all the toppings and such. I had a pizza with pepperoni, onion, bell pepper, and sausage. My pizza was for take out so I stood to the side with my number and waited for the pizza. While waiting other pizzas came out and a worker was using a pizza cutter to cut around the very burnt edges and another worker saw this and stopped him right away. He said the pizza was burnt and a new one would need to be made. This happened a second time while waiting for my pizza. I grew concerned my pizza would be burnt and when I opened up my pizza box my fears were right. The toppings looked good and all but the edge of the pizza was so badly burnt and the crust was way too thin. It was like someone took a large saltine cracker and put some toppings on it then burnt a majority of it. I was able to break off a lot of the burnt crust and eat the rest which wasn't that bad but nothing I'd come back for there was just nothing WOW about it."}
{"text":"The previous time I visited they said they no longer carried wheat crust even though it was on their menu so I had to get gluten free which is $2 more because it is the only other vegan one. The second time I came they were out of Daiya Cheese after waiting 30 min in line and didn't offer to make one without cheese and just threw the crust away."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and fantastic service. They go above and beyond to make customers happy. The price is very reasonable and it is such a fun treat for the kids. I love that you can put feta and sun dried tomatoes on the pizza! So yummy. My favorite."}
{"text":"I LOVE Pieology!!!! Went for lunch with my co-workers. Wasn't too crowded unlike other restaurants in that shopping center. Having the ability to create your own is amazing! The staff was going above and beyond with their attentive customer service. Especially, a guy named Z. Great staff, great food, great location! You can't beat it. Your pizza woes are solved, it's easy as Pie-ology!!!"}
{"text":"Just came in for my second time. I'm already in love. Got a split pie to share with my sister. We are super excited to come here more often! 
You start with the crust, which the offer wheat, white, or gluten free. Then move on to sauce, cheese's, toppings, and meats. There is nothing not to love about a fresh made, custom pizza made right in front of you, and on your table Iess than 10 minues!"}
{"text":"The food and staff here are always great. This is one of my favorite places to eat for lunch and as a vegetarian its sometimes hard to find places to go with friends. The staff is always very nice when I ask them to change their gloves because I don't like the gloves to touch the meat from the previous pizza. They have a selection of toppings you can put on your pizza and many different sauces and cheeses. A great place!"}
{"text":"Favorite Pizza place in town! A fun and creative way to eat a good pie and for 7.95 and tax you can't beat the price for a 11.5 inch with unlimited toppings. So glad they are a miles distance away."}
{"text":"Today my pizza was very good! Lamar was very nice and made sure my pizza was how I like it! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Service isn't that great, the staff kind of looks like they wanna kill themselves. (Sorry) The pizza was pretty good, price is fair, but nothing special. Not eager to come back, but if someone I knew wanted to eat here I wouldn't be opposed."}
{"text":"I've gone to this location quite a few times and have always had exceptional service.  They created my customized order of extra crispy with all meats pizza to a tee, and that's all I really ask for in a place like this."}
{"text":"Great pizza very great service my kids love it here because they get to kick their own pizza . They are delicious and fast and I like the lemonades and teas they offer m. The staff is very friendly. They get super. On the evenings."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty!  Ordering was pretty easy and my pizza was ready in no time."}
{"text":"I've eaten here once before and wasn't that impressed. I've been to better pizza places with the same concept. The reason why this is getting a 1 star review is because of one employee. I was picking up an order for someone else and the whole time I was waiting she was constantly touching her purpleish/brown hair. She never washed her hands but proceeded to cut and serve other people's pizzas. Thank goodness someone else cut my friends pizza."}
{"text":"Good service for sure. Not exactly my first choice but it will be a regular. The pizza is made a lot like a Subway or Chipotle. So if you want it they will make it for you. I just wish they had more choices in crust."}
{"text":"Tried there restraint for the first time.  10 out of 10.  From the moment I walked in the door the atmosphere was great.  Dining room was clean no dirty tables.    They help me with my order because it was my first time.  Very friendly associates.  Food presentation was great.   And the pizza was the best I have ever had.    My only complaint would be the high prices.  But the prices are high everywhere.  You definitely get your moneys worth at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pieology Pieology where art thou Pieology?

I have been going to Pieology for around 2 years now and I consider myself an expert in pointing out the sign from a mile away. However; while in this location on Howard Hughes Center Drive I had no idea where I was. I walked in and was taken aback by the great jams they were playing! Automatically, I happily danced my way to the front serving line. When I reached the glass I noticed how cold it was in the restaurant and asked the crew member \" Is it a little cold in here to you?\" She replied with a \"No.\" I then realized that the manager that was standing by the oven who was holding a larger-than-me pizza tool.  I noticed that he was tuning in to our conversation so I asked \" How about you? are you cold in here?\" He replied with a \" Would you be cold if you were standing by this hot oven?\" Baffled I gave a nervous laugh and uncomfortably turned my attention back to the crew member. Now, I'm no expert making dough, however I could tell by the loud grunt and irritated look on her face that she messed up some how some way. I tried to give her words of encouragement so I simply said \" Its okay take your time.\" She then looked up and gave me a blank look as if I was the creator of her frustration. She began her decent by applying the red peppers I asked for on my pizza and I was amazed to see her skip past the tongs she is required to use and stick her hand in the container. I then asked for cilantro thinking that she would change her gloves but was surprised to see her stick the same unwashed hand into the cilantro and the spinach shortly after. I work with food so I know how big of a food safety violation this is so I snapped my attention to the manager who was standing close by however he seemed unfazed. I know how Pieology is known for having \"healthy\" food and that was my expectations walking in. If it wasn't for me walking out with a pizza I wouldn't have known I even visited a Pieology. The best thing about this visit was definitely the Mariah Carey song that was playing when I entered and even she was off pitch."}
{"text":"Yuummm!!! Very good, super friendly staff, clean,  price is not bad at all. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I like this pieology location. Always clean friendly speedy. Always a good experience. We have tried MOD pizza. I like it there too but I think pieology just a tad bit better. Never too packed. Good atmosphere. Delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza....you can get unlimited toppings at an amazing price and the pizza is to die for.....I love it! The staff is very friendly and address you as soon as you walk in the door. The place is clean and it is always busy."}
{"text":"Love this build your own pizza concept! Delicious. The staff is on the ball! All very friendly and helpful. I love the peach tea there too! Will definitely continue to come here!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, great every time! It's like chipotle, but for pizza. The crust is perfectly cooked, and it's very affordable. The staff is nice as well. Best part? One price, all the toppings!"}
{"text":"Just 7.99 for a build your own pizza, as many toppings as you like! And the crust is nice and thin, with fresh ingredients! I loved it! :)"}
{"text":"So I wait in line a good 5 minutes or so before getting to the create your pizza counter and when I finally get up there I'm told that the dough isn't vegan! I always ask even if I've been to a place a million times because you never know if recipes change. I guess PIEOLOGY HAS CHANGED THEIR RECIPE! 
Really though, how do you have VEGAN daiya cheese but not a vegan pizza dough?! The saddest part is that I've been here TWICE before and both times I was told that their crust was VEGAN! 
SO either I was being lied to the past two times I've come here and that I've been ingesting something that my morals and beliefs go against OR this employee and the manager he asked are incompetent when it comes to the food they serve their customers. 
Either way, there were pieces of mozzarella cheese floating around in the marinara which wasn't gonna fly with me any way. 
This sucks. I wanted pizza :("}
{"text":"Alanna was amazing!!! Thank you for great customer service and making the perfect pizza. I will most definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Well, my build as you like veggie pesto pizza with the all wheat crust tasted great!  The problem was that it wasn't enough.  After spending around $12 with a drink for fast food, you think you will be full.  The pizza was too thin and light.  I suppose I could have added meat but I don't like them in my pizza.  Good fast service."}
{"text":"Since the grand opening the place has been a bit slower (which I don't mind!) 
Build your own pizza, what's not to love? 
When ordering to-go, they open the box to make sure the pizza looks good since they bake it fresh. 

Love how they have boxes on the side with the fountain drinks so you can just grab and go. They don't offer mall discounts if you work at Downtown Summerlin :(
Parking can be tough to find and for a place not as busy, the store could be tidier....tables in particular."}
{"text":"While having a stay-cation at the MGM, I noticed an aroma coming from a pizza chain I haven't tried yet.  We were entering from the parking garage and passed it heading toward the escalator.  The aroma enticed me to give it a try.  

My better half and I tried two different pies~ The Spicy Italian as well as the Smokin' Buffalo Chicken.  I was incredibly happy with both choices.  The Spicy Italian, which we chose with thick crust, had a bounty of salami, sausage, basil, garlic and chili flakes.  Their ingredients were fresh on the garlic butter crust.  

There is no complaints about the Smokin' Buffalo Chicken pizza either.  We chose to go 'Thin' on this pizza crust.  The toppings of chicken, gorgonzola and mozzarella held up nicely even on the thinner crust choice.  They drizzle the hot buffalo sauce after baking which I'm assuming so it won't sog up the crust.  Very spicy but full of flavor.  

Both pizzas were tasty in their own right.  I am very impressed with this chain.  If staying in the MGM, it's certainly worth the try!"}
{"text":"The service was not bad. The staff was very willing to assist. I only wanted a salad; no pizza. The weird thing was they only had pre-made romaine lettuce bowls and no mixed greens as advertised. Also no Kalamata olives, no spicy chicken or garbanzo beans as advertised as well. When I asked for garbanzo beans they looked at me as if I was strange. Yet the spicy chicken and garbanzo beans were the two main things I was looking forward to. 

Overall not bad just wish they had the toppings that were advertised."}
{"text":"The service sucks... no one there wants to work... I left because they didn't want to take an order, they just wanted to stand around doing nothing. The worst one I've been to yet."}
{"text":"It was great as always great service and great food. Colin was the guy helping us we brought our friend here for the first time and she loved it!"}
{"text":"So Im on my 1hr lunch break and I stopped by here. it's my first time eating here. The one person that made my pizza was good. It was just the guy who was ringing me out that cooked my pizza was not paying attention to the pizza. He was on his phone the whole time. I don't know about policies about having a phone out while your working especially when in the kitchen. The picture describes how he was paying attention. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am beyond amazed by this pizza place. I absolutely love the concept of being able to design your own pizza. I walked in & immediately was greeted with outstanding customer service.  I brought my 10 month old son in with me.  And they came right over to my table with a high chair. (can you say catering to your customers) I can't wait to tell all of my friends and family about this fantastic restaurant.  Pieology, you guys are truly changing the pizza game here in Chandler."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was unpleasant. One of their workers (which I won't name online) was very rude and didn't say a word when it came my turn in line. She starred at me with no expression. I ordered just a plain cheese pizza so I just said no toppings but she didn't say anything. When I repeated what I had said because she just continued to look at me not saying a word, she then replied with \"I know.\" The only words out of her. I was disappointed and annoyed with the lack of friendly customer service. This had happened the last time I had been in there with the same girl, but I figured she was just having a bad day. Second time is just an unfriendly worker."}
{"text":"Awesome joint. Build your own pizza with unlimited toppings for under 8bucks. Taste really good too."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm... All I can say its better than a burger and their ingredients are always fresh. They have a $10 coupon when you order through grubhub however there seems to always be a problem where they can never take the full $10 off. the guy was nice enough to give a free drink in place where the pizza is worth any hassle."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time yesterday and it was great! Got gluten free crust with herb butter (no sauce) and mozzarella, ricotta, pepperroni, mushrooms, onion, artichokes, roasted red peppers and basil, and it was REALLY good! Next time I would ask them to cook it a little longer though because I like my toppings cooked a bit more. Food was really fast and fresh and inexpensive. Would like to try their salads too."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite place to get a pizza, they always listen carefully to instructions and always make sure my pizza is made to perfection.
I've been here so many times and everyone is friendly, but Michael goes above and beyond to make my experience extremely pleasant. He usually does everything on his own and he's so quick and efficient, not to mention so friendly. I hope Michael makes my pizza every time I'm here! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I really like pieology a lot, but this location was a disappointment. I took my son to lunch and right from the start the expierence went sour.  The door was still locked despite them being open for 12 minutes. We peeked in the windows and saw noone so I called them to make sure they were open. They said that the door gets 'stuck' sometimes, but then we saw the employee come from the back and unlock the door.   We were not greeted at all. Instead a very bored and disinterested looking guy named Ish asked us what we wanted and mumbled to us while making our pizzas.  We both ordered spicy italian, and Ish forgot to put the italian sausage on mine. When I asked him about it he seemed annoyed and tossed it on.  The female employee was a little more friendly but certainly did not seem to be too enthusiastic about being at work. I was pretty dissapointed, but the location was clean, the ingredients were fresh, and the prices were decent, though I did. Not remember or notice that there was a crust upcharge at the location across town.  Over all I am giving three stars down from a 4 because of the bored l, unfriendly customer service."}
{"text":"favorite place ever.....
this place has the bes pizza everrrf, they are friendly,and the pizza is so good and fresh. the only thing I hate is that they got rud of the fresh made salads vs the pre package fridge salads they sell now."}
{"text":"Just go to project.pie and get same.pizza for lower price.  The house salad is a joke!"}
{"text":"I am in love with Pieology. I've there at least 12 times. It's my go to place whenever one of my friends wants to eat out at an inexpensive place. I always order the margarita pizza and it ever fails to please me. I absolutely love the concept of Pieology. It's like the Subway of ordering pizza. It's quick, simple, and cheap. It's a casual place to grab a bite. If the restaurant were closer to where I lived, I'd be there twice a week or more haha"}
{"text":"Tuesday night and I want pizza......well dominos said it would be a 50 minute wait.......no brainier go else where. I decided to try Pieology........
The pizza's are one size since they are specialty pizzas. I went for the pepperoni, green pepper and onion pizza.  The pizza itself was not bad,
However had I gone across the street to Blaze pizza I think I would of been
Happier. The flavor was very good.....however the policy of this establishment should be explained in regard to beer. I ordered a beer for my 
Pizza TO GO.....I received the canned beer and asked the clerk not to open
It. He opened it and explained that their policy is no beer sales to go.....
I said my pizza is to go and I don't like to drink and drive. He offered to refund my money......long story short.....I took the beer home a little flat after it had been opened.  On the other hand my wife says it's the best 
Pizza she has had.......this is a good place to eat....I would recommend this place to pie lovers. My own option is it is good, however those were the
Smallest pieces of pepperoni I have ever had......Enjoy"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here especially because they offer a pretty good gluten free crust but today the staff was very rude! The first lady looked like she was pissed she had to be there. When a customer ahead of me went to get her pizza, the worker laughed at her for how she pronounced her name. Then when I asked for basil after my pizza was kicked, she took it back to pissed off lady, proceeded to look at me and laugh and then brought back the pizza without saying anything. The pizza really isn't worth it for service like that."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday evening. It was pretty empty but staff was very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately when they say unlimited toppings in my opinion I don't think they really mean it. They are very frugal with the amount of toppings they put on, especially the meats. I asked for extra bacon and could barely see any. Same goes for the sausage. The local competition means it when they say unlimited toppings and when you ask for extra bacon or another meat, you get it! I will say that Pieology's pizza crust is definitely better and more crispy than the local competition in Chandler. Not sure yet if I'll return..."}
{"text":"We visited Pieology Pizzeria on 6/8/17. Location is fairly new so there were only a couple tables in restaurant. Pizza was delicious, staff was friendly and professional and restaurant was clean. Pizza only took about 8 minutes so it would be a great location if you were in a hurry.
Love the whole Pieology concept of customizing your pizza. We would definitely return. This was our first visit to Pieology so we were impressed. We will also try the other locations."}
{"text":"Pretty bad pizza. Sure its custom made,but it just tasn't taste that good. Our favorite custom pizza place is 800 degrees which is the best in town. This was below average - and the spicy sauce was way too spicy - it was all we could taste!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Reasonably priced . clean facilities. Friendly staff with helpful suggestions for newcomers."}
{"text":"I have to agree, we had lunch here yesterday, deciding between Pandora, habit or chipotle-- great concept and fast-- custom made pizza one size plenty for one or share, fresh ingredients- if course five stars a bit much you say, ok fine, but fast food pizza the way you want it is a great idea and here it works."}
{"text":"I'm an avid fan of this establishment. I was a regular at the original location in Fullerton, CA. It meets up to the Pieology standards. 

My only complaint is there's always something going on inside the sitting area during business hours. I feel like that stuff (photoshoots, etc.) should be done before or after business hours, regardless if it's a week day or not."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them zero stars, but since I can't, here it goes. My husband and I went on to order food and there was no line. We walked up and were taking about their pizza crust because it was sitting out and looked crusty. My husband started his order and they grabbed the crusty dough and when he asked for fresh dough they gave him an attitude about it. He shrugged it off thinking it was just more work. Then when they put the sauce on, it was only on one side and he asked them four times (over the extremely loud music) to spread it out but they refused saying it was fine. 
Well, that was it for us, we had enough from them and left. I have no idea how their food tastes, but if you want a good pizza that you can build your way, go to Blaze instead...and they have great lemonade too."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and fresh, fast ingredients! Jake was very helpful and we will be ordering for more corporate lunches in the future!"}
{"text":"This used to be a place I would go to for healthier choices, especially the whole wheat dough, until they removed the whole wheat. With the option removed, I no longer go there at all, though I would still recommend it if you like pizza. Disappointing that they started a healthier trend for pizza and then gave up."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and the service is well below what I'd expect to receive. Their team members seem lost and not capable of answering questions. 
I ordered a pizza and wasn't given an option to add toppings. 
I'm really disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great place. This was our first visit and to our surprise we got to make a pizza the way we wanted. As a mom I usually have the family chose the pizza they want with the toppings they want. Here for the price I got to chose what I wanted. I got my own pizza :) The place is nice and clean and the staff  was friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There pizza is alot better than the other chain stores nice atmosphere stone oven makes the best tasting pizza"}
{"text":"Ronnie rocks it at the counter, and the management keeps it running tight! My favorite neighborhood pizza place!"}
{"text":"It's always a good day when ALANNA is working here! She's seriously the coolest girl that works here. I come here almost 3 times a week and it is always a good visit when we greet each other. Also the two males that worked today at 1400. Super cool dudes. I'm not the only one that love these three either, about 3 of my friends come here also and look forward to seeing them.
I would honestly stop coming if Alanna ever worked somewhere else. And I know for sure my friends wouldn't come either."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza! Had the spicy Italian and cheese bread. Wish we had one in Oklahoma."}
{"text":"Solid place to stop for pizza. I came by for lunch and it was surprisingly quiet, but I'm not complaining! It took no time for the pizza to cook, too... even better! 

The \"regular\" crust is very thin. I'd try the thick crust next time and see if that's more my style. The thin crust is still super yummy though. Great, fresh variety of toppings and sauces for infinite combos. The Alfredo sauce is out of this world. Topped with a pinch of sea salt after firing and it was perfection. I would probably have them double my toppings next time. It's a little on the light side. But that's the beauty of this place is you can have them make it exactly how you want it without having to pay extra for anything."}
{"text":"While I do love Pieology in CA, this one lacks the other items I am used to. The specific option is Gluten-free dough. Of all the Pieology stores I have visited, this is the only one that does not offer this option. While I am in the minority in this, it has a most significant impact on my dining decision. Other pizza stores offer this allergy-free option, an I will have to settle for sub-par gluten-free pizza for now."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! The food was spectacular and the service was even better. The store was spotless and the atmosphere fresh and casual. Well done!"}
{"text":"got diarrhea from this place. as did my boyfriend. and my mom. food illness outbreak.. (health department rules that if two or more people get sick it's an outbreak). you're welcome."}
{"text":"Love this place, but have been waiting forever for the location in Surprise to open up! When will you be opening? I finally see some progress on the inside the building! Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the new location for the first time tonight. It was fantastic! Staff was so nice and pizza was great! We actually had one of your staff stop by our table to ask how everything was and to make sure we were happy with our pizza! We have never had that done before and it was so appreciated! She had a smile and was so sweet! I was about to ask her name and then I saw her name tag. Kudos to you Alli for making our first experience so great! We will definitely be back when the grandkids come to visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing my size pizza!!! I recommend this place to anyone who wants to make their own pizza."}
{"text":"CPK definitely has my business. Drove all the way to downtown summerlin, twice! I got a BBQ chicken pizza to go and there was no BBQ sauce... driest thing ever. So, I called them up and asked for compensation and their first suggestion was to add BBQ sauce to the pizza that was already cold.... like one do you not have food warmers/heat lamps, and two you aren't even trying to compensate us. Then, they told us to bring back the old pizza for a new one. Never had an establishment want the food they fucked up on just to throw it away but okay. Oh, and the workers excuse was it was a lot of first kids' jobs. Okay... so check to see if a pizza is completed right or hire competent enough people to add sauce. I'll definitely just go to CPK next time, they can get orders right and they actually have crust lol."}
{"text":"I finally made my way down to the Pieology in Summerlin, and I have to say Eastside and the Cannery locations are simply the best. 

Much of the issues with this location are related to the clientele, which cannot be controlled. Summerlinians, you get a three for being rude. 

The line is completely outrageous, which is a good and a bad thing. The location by the strip has ridiculous lines, but they move so quickly you don't notice. We waited behind 8 people for over 15 minutes. This is partly due to the staff and partly due to the patrons. The foot traffic is outstanding for this business.

Right now, there are... 15 children under 10 and around 10 teenagers. The noise level is almost unbearable, which may be because of the acoustics in here. That explains why the outdoor seating is all taken. 

Also one mother has taken over the entire community table to have a pizza party for her son, I'm talking birthday cake and goody bags. So for all you families, kids are more than welcome!

The process of building my pizza was a little stressful. The young lady kept pushing my pizza to the next stage, and I realized that my pizza doesn't taste right because I have no sauce. Being rushed to go through this line doesn't help speed up the time if I keep having to tell you to bring the pizza back, add more of this (they skimp on the portions of everything), etc. 

My husband confirmed that the flavors here were too bland; we eat at this place enough to know what flavors to expect. It was good, not great, but it hit the spot.

I won't come back to this location if I'm craving Pieology, but I also won't complete count it out. Next time I make my way here, I will update my review to five stars if the service is better..."}
{"text":"Dear North Las Vegans:

How in the world did you get a Pieology?! I am jealous, and you are spoiled!

If you've never had it - think Chipotle style dining, but with pizza.

When I heard this new location had opened, I had to check it out for myself. From the moment I arrived at the plaza, I was in awe. This location is gorgeous, inside and out! I love the trendy industrial style that blends well with the luxurious touches and pops of color.

I was greeted immediately upon entry by a full staff with friendly faces. I could tell they all had 'The Mark of Jake'; Jake is the District Manager who I met at the Eastside shop. If I ever had an issue with anything (which was like... twice in one hundred visits), he not only fixed it with me, but also fixed it in the store. His staff members are always polite, friendly and on point, and this shop in NLV is no exception. 

So, when I got up to the line, I found that it was more beautiful than usual. The setup is almost exactly the same as I was used to - but I will say - they added SHAVED PARMESAN at the end (NOM).

My Pieology Equation(TM) - aka my custom pie - is called The O'Hara. 

It starts with a thin wheat crust with butter and olive oil. I skip the sauce base and instead add a little sauce on top of the cheese. All five of the cheeses are a go for me - that's Mozzarella, Parmesan, light Feta, extra Gorgonzola, and 5 small scoops of Ricotta. Yeah, it's that serious. Then I add a few swirls of Alfredo before the veggies. I start with a little extra of both basil and cilantro, a few pieces of spinach (which are now chopped up - hooray!), and some garlic. My favorite meat toppings are pepperoni and spicy chicken. And as I mentioned, there are some new additions at the end of the line (perhaps it is also for people to create salads?), so I added fresh black pepper and shaved Parmesan. 

Yes, I get the same pizza every time. I'm a creature of habit. But what I think I love most about Pieology is that no matter what I get, I pay the same price. (They have a Gluten Free crust for a couple bucks more - but I'm talking toppings here, people). 

I paid my $8.64 (including tax) and within 5 minutes time I was taking a bite of one of the most delicious pizzas I've had in forever. The guy who delivered it asked me if I needed anything, like dipping sauces or toppings, and he checked back with me about halfway through my meal. It's like fancy-fast-fare. 

Whether you are on your lunch break or headed to see a movie across the street, I highly recommend you check this place out. Two people can grab two fresh custom pies and a drink for around $20. In less than 10 minutes. That is unreal. Date night will never be the same. 

Nom."}
{"text":"[I am updating my review AGAIN because I have seen even more progress since last month!]

In the past 6 months, my husband and I have been to Pieology between 30 to 40 times. We haven't gone as often lately because we tried giving it up for Lent. Yes, that is how bad our obsession had become. (Good news, we only cheated twice!)

As I said in my first reviews:
\"The first time I was dragged here, I was skeptical; I love pizza, but do I really want what I assumed to be fast food style pizza? How long was it going to take? Would it be filling? Was it expensive?

\"Obviously all my questions were answered and I ended up overjoyed by this decision.\"

\"Like Chipotle and many other casual fast-food places, you are able to build your meal (in this case, a pizza) as everything is laid out right in front. First you start with your crust - I am a huge fan of the wheat - and you prepare your base. I like to mix all five of the cheeses on top of an Alfredo base - it tastes like a white pizza. 

There are so many toppings to choose from, so I also recommend planning ahead before you just start adding things; the crust is thin and the toppings could end up piled high if you aren't paying attention. I add basil, cilantro, light spinach and some garlic. For my meats, I choose half pepperoni and half spicy chicken. (Go half and half to get two pizzas on one pie!)

No matter what you get, your price is $7.95.\" 

\"They bake the thin crust pizza in a SUPER hot pizza oven; the char on the bottom of your pie adds to the flavor.\"

Now, the reason I wanted to completely update this is because I have discovered some differences in the staff AGAIN! \"To be clear, I have never met anyone on staff that made me want to leave a bad review; everyone is courteous, and some are even friendly to the 'regulars'.\"

Previously, I recommended that you visit on evenings and weekends. This was because the manager of the nighttime/weekend staff (Jose) was doing so much to go above and beyond that we got spoiled. Coming in during the day and dealing with certain attitudes (like, Crystal, for example) turned us off. Sean was decent, but we noticed a lack of zeal during his shifts at that time; they seemed more interested in getting us out than giving us delicious pizzas. Well, I am proud to announce that things have changed!!!

The crews have definitely evened out; I will say, I still prefer to visit when either Sean or Jose is working because there is just a better general vibe. These two managers encourage their crews to bring the 'casual' into this fast-food place, making it more of a dining experience than a 'drive through' deal. They make our experience special from the beginning: they greet you upon entry, ensure tables are available until close, and generally make you feel welcome. Best of all, throughout the experience, they seem genuinely happy to serve you, even making conversation. 

To point out the all-stars: Jerry, Justus and Joseph are some of my favorite team members. Whether they are on the line or working the oven, I can trust them to deliver the perfect pie!

\"I also had the pleasure of meeting Jake, the District Manager. He is awesome! The day we met, he was supposed to end his day at a normal hour (like 4/5/6pm), but didn't end up leaving until almost 9. He was training a newer employee. This franchise is just on point, all around.\" Based on the progress I have seen, Jake is definitely doing an outstanding job in encouraging his team to be the best they can, every shift! I commend him on his ability to deal with the usual fast-food issues (like high turnover, drama from younger employees, etc.) to create a place that I actually want to visit. Thank you, Jake, for listening to my comments and providing direction for your team - we see it and we appreciate it!

\"No matter what - TRY PIEOLOGY.\"

\"Two people can get two pies with unlimited toppings and a drink for $20!\""}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle for thin crust pizza  

Pros:
-Made to order. The food is fresh and hasn't been sitting under a warmer. You also get to personalize your pizza with all the toppings you want for just $12.
-Pretty good selection of toppings. Lots of different meats and cheeses. I would have liked some more options for sauce. 
-Portions are very generous for $12. I recommend getting your own pizza but you could share one if you weren't very hungry. 
-Located in The Underground. It's a hidden gem that isn't too busy. 

Cons:
-Topping inconsistency. However, they were happy to add more if you asked. 
-Pizza is good for the price but not amazing. I'd come again for something (relatively) cheap and fresh, but if I wanted the best pizza on the strip, this wouldn't be it."}
{"text":"Excellent team of staff . Very helpful and pizza was amazingly tasty. Love it . Location was very comfortable and very very clean . Family had a wonderful time . Thank you to all the employees."}
{"text":"Love pizza.  Love concept.  Crust is meh, toppings lacked flavor and taste.  Fired Pie is much better."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned the concept is a winner.  The crust isn't the greatest but it's good enough and you can't beat a fresh pie with literally all the toppings you want for $8."}
{"text":"I really enjoy taking my kids here.  I've been here maybe a dozen times now with the kids and they love to pick the toppings on the pizza.  

The staff are young but really nice. It's easy to pick the pizza toppings that you want and the wait is very reasonable.  

Seats are open and there are plenty there. It probably gets the most busiest in the evenings so I try to come here during lunch or right before the dinner rush.  

I love their special lemonade drinks here.  Will come back again regularly!"}
{"text":"You can never ever go wrong with Pieology! My love for this place started back when I went to high school in San Jose, CA. My friends and I would go multiple times a week and we never cared about how long the line was cos it always went by quick and our pizzas were always delicious esp for the price!! When i saw Pieology was FINALLY opening up in Vegas I was super excited!!
Crazy part is, there are several other customizable pizza joints similar to Pieology that have been opened and established here in Vegas that people aren't as familiar to Pieology here ~ meaning lines for Pieology aren't as long as I am used to from California which great on my end, but omg more people need to come because they deserve to be cracking all day everyday haha. 
Each time my bf and I come in there's no line but service and food is ALWAYS amazing. You get u limited toppings for such a great price, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"My two year old LOVES pizza. We loved going to Pieology when we lived in CA, so we were excited to find one in Chandler. Sadly, we will NEVER go back to this location. I ordered two pizzas online. I purposefully went to pick them after my scheduled pick up time hoping to give them a chance to cool off. They were just going in the oven when we arrived! They cooked really fast, so I assumed they were just reheating them. When the cook showed the pizzas to me, I didn't pay close attention to how well done the toppings were which proved to be a HUGE mistake. We got the pizzas home. The toppings looked a little undercooked  but we still devoured them. Then a few hrs after, all heck broke loose! Both of us were doubled over in pain with stomach cramps. The cramping was the least of our worries. We've had to cancel all plans for the day since we can't venture too far from the restroom (use your imagination). Shame on me for not asking them to cook the pizzas longer. Shame on THEM for serving undercooked pizzas. Lesson learned. And this is one lesson that will NEVER be repeated."}
{"text":"This Pieology location is my first experience with this chain, and my wife and I have eaten there 3 times since they opened.  Essentially what you have with Pieology is one of those custom pizza eateries (you choose the crust, you choose the sauce, you choose the toppings, etc.), and the restaurant also offers up some basic choices that are tried and true choices.  Then you take your seat, and the staff brings out your pie after its been blazed quickly in one of those fancy ovens.  So the flavor really depends upon what you're in the mood for, but the combinations are pretty amazing.  What you like, you can choose.  Excellent choices, and the wait has always been relatively short, even when they had a pretty packed house.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Pieology- you make made to order pies, why do you make you salads in the morning & expect customers to buy them??"}
{"text":"Our first time here and I was impressed by the great level of service! Everyone who worked there was so friendly, the manager even thanked us for coming in!"}
{"text":"I never knew how much I enjoyed building my own pizza! Honestly I always just went to the chain pizza places but no more. Been coming here about once a week. For the most part, it's consistent. The ingredients are fresh and there is an extremely noticeable difference in the quality of the pizza compared to a chain.

Understand that this place gets crowded! This is an extremely busy mall and 'Merica loves pizza....It's not unusual for there to be 50 people inside the place and a totally full oven. Be patient when you come at busy hours, because the line can stretch outside the door. A good time I found to go so far is around 2-3 or after 8.

Employees are nice and are good at staying focused and on track."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for individual size pizzas!! It's very fast, very fresh, and very very great!! They have options for gluten as well which is perfect for my health conscious people!! Awesome place quick and easy"}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm not a pizza person and I can eat this over and over again!!!! I get buffalo chicken and it's amazing!!! Beat deal in town!"}
{"text":"part of eating here was the salad you could enjoy with your pizza. however they reduced the size of the salad not the price. I was a regular customer, the staff is amazing always friendly but now the salad is very disappointing"}
{"text":"They exceed every time... Its busy as its lunch but they arent pushing you thru they are still making quality pizzas! I drive 25 mins from Henderson to eat here."}
{"text":"Get whatever you want on a thin-crust pizza for a single reasonable price, in about 5 minutes, and the staff is crazy friendly.

No, seriously, you tell them your choice of crust (whole wheat or gluten free or traditional), sauce, cheese, and toppings, and they make it right in front of you, like a sandwich shop, but they don't charge extra for more meat or whatever.  Then they bake it in the pizza oven, which takes about 5 minutes.

The food is good, but it's not \"authentic\" New York or Chicago or whatever style - but you can see the ingredients are fresh, and it's made however you want it, so set aside your expectations and enjoy.

I finished my pizza the first time I was there, but the next time I took the rest home in a to-go box - which is just the right size for a half pizza, so it's not stupidly big in the fridge.

If you're with a group and this doesn't sound like your kind of place, right next door there's a Chipotle, a Habit Burger, and a Jamba Juice, so shut up and go already."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious. I built my own gluten-free pizza (love that they serve that option) and the service was fantastic. The young girl at the cash register was so friendly and helpful!!! The only negative is that when I insisted on tipping her, she declined saying that they can not accept tips, that instead I should review the experience on yelp!! I still would have done the review because I enjoyed the place, but I also would've loved to tip her for her great service...This a service-oriented town where tips are the norm when you provide or receive service!!!"}
{"text":"So today I came into pieology and I call them my power squad because everytime I go in there, whelp they always welcome me with the greatest astronomical vibes all the time. I feel like they deserve to be recognized. I have had some experiences in which I didn't get positive vibes or an experience. But it never fails when Jose, Santiago, Jasmine and Stephanie are there I'm going to get a phenomenal experience. The way the communicate and work with each other is amazing to watch. Never a dull negative moment on the floor when you watch them.  If you want your pie to be made with love and positivity well gosh darn it go when they are on the floor. You will not be disappointed. Thank you my power squad for delivering that customer service consistently every time I stop by."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing!. Love the thin crust, unlimited toppings and made right in front of me. Super fast service, pizza was on the table very quickly. The ceasar salad was good, generously sized. Top it off with a coke and it's a great lunch. Will be back.  Forgot to get a pic of the pie. This is all thats left."}
{"text":"I was craving pizza, after flying into town and neighbor suggested we check this place out.

The joynt was clean, bright, contemporary with a warm friendly greeting from the staff.  Not sure what's with all the look alike joynts that are popping up a la Chipotle and Einstein's, but I'm not really a fan of these concepts because they require too much work on my part just to order some food.

At any rate, the pizza was decent, but nothing special for me.  I'd get it again, if I just wanted something close by and simple.

Next stop.................Fired Pie and Federal Pizza."}
{"text":"Pieology has a simple concept. Build your own personal pizzas or choose from one of their recipes-Chipotle style! 

Each pizza starts on a 12\" cracker crust either regular or wheat flavor. I wanted to try 2 different pies so I chose their recipe bbq chicken which has mozzarella, chicken, gorgonzola, red onion, cilantro and a bbq sauce drizzle. Then I made a custom pie with olive oil as the sauce, mozzarella, ricotta and parmesan cheeses, artichokes, garlic, tomatoes and pepperoni. I enjoyed the bbq chicken pizza, but I think the one I made was better by far. You can add as many toppings as you like to each pizza, and don't be afraid to ask for extra. The guy making my pie was pretty blah, but the guy who was working the ovens was really friendly. I didn't catch his name, but I think he was the manager.

Each pie is $9 plus tax. I was expecting the pizza's to be small, but they were reasonably sized at 11.5 inches each. I even had enough for leftovers. They also have premade salads, breadsticks and cinnamon sticks. I have since been back since my original visit and you can apparently build your own salads too! 

If you sign up for their rewards club online you get free order of cinnamon or herb butter strips, WITH a purchase of a pizza or salad."}
{"text":"The fist thing you hear when you walk in is a voice sayin hi, welcome to pieology! When u get to the counter u realize the cheerful employee who greeted you, her name is Brittany! She offered her recommendation of what I should try since it's my first time here. I appreciate Brittany and the staffs upbeat attitude, it's refreshing in society who forgets what customer service is. The pizza was presented and cooked to perfection for me. I will return, to say hi to Brittany, and once again enjoy the atmosphere and pizza.."}
{"text":"Love the pizzas here!! And now they have both thin and thick crust. You can not go wrong with either. I always get the create your own with unlimited toppings. I like they have one low price for that and don't charge extra for certain toppings. 
I love the quotes they have on the wall its different. 
If you like pizza this is your place! Fresh and good you can not go wrong."}
{"text":"Really awesome new Pizzeria. Spectacular array of different sauces and toppings. Quick-service clean environment and very reasonable prices. And most importantly it's extremely delicious I'll definitely be coming back here frequently."}
{"text":"Small little pizza place about 15 mins from  Red rock canyon park. Great place to grab quick lunch or dinner. We tried Chicken buffalo and rustic veggie and both were really good."}
{"text":"This is kind of like the \"Subway of Pizza\", but it isn't bad at all! The location is clean and bright, and the employees are friendly.
You start out with a 12 inch, very thin crust pizza (regular or wheat, I believe are the choices), and then select your sauce, cheeses, meats, and veggies. As this can be a little overwhelming, you can also select one of their creations if you prefer.  After paying at the counter, they bring the pizza to your table. There are fountain drinks and even to-go boxes for your leftovers available.

The pizza itself was quite good! The toppings were fresh and the crust was tasty. 

All of the pizzas, whether you load it up with toppings or not, are about $8, which is a very fair price. I only wish there was an option for hand-tossed or deep dish pizzas."}
{"text":"First time in one of these.. sober lol so I actually had the chance to order for myself for once. 

Basically it's a Subway but for Pizza 
Ordered a custom, thin-crust Pizza & baker it fresh for me it came maybe 5-10 minutes later. Everything tasted Great, Aurora's the Best lol very patient with me thanks"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and it's always delicious! I love that youcan build your own pizza with all the toppings you want for the same price (if only the other pizza places would join suit). The toppings are fresh and the crust is crispy. Everyone is nice too. The only drawback is parking during busy times is a HOT MESS...but thats an issue with all the nearby places as well and not really the fault of pieology. Still not enough to give less than 5 stars"}
{"text":"Extremely impressed with this place. I have no idea why this has not been offered sooner. Build your own pizza and baked fresh in a matter of minutes. Cheap considering its a whole pizza and you can add all the toppings you want! Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Excellent service! Pizza was delicious and you can add as many toppings or as few for same price:) highly recommend it here!! We will definitely be back! Restaurant is clean, service was great and food was perfect!"}
{"text":"Headed in for the grand opening of Pieology. It was a charity night and all pizzas were five dollars. All proceeds went to charity. The wait was long but that is expected during the first few weeks and during such a great deal. The staff was very nice with smiles on their faces even though it was a long day. We will definitely be back! The pizza was delicious! Very happy to have a Pieology close to home!"}
{"text":"Fresh delicious pizza. The three young men working were every professional and helpful. We finally found a pizza in Arizona we like. Can't remember their names. Today is sunday June 11,2017. We were there at 1:30- 2:00"}
{"text":"Claims he be healthy and fresh but discontinued whole weat pizza ? What's next are they gonna discontinue  the gluten free"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. If you don't like thin crust you can request the thicker crust (for more $). The first time I went... the service was painfully slow. The second time was a bit better. Don't go if you are in a hurry though! Staff is friendly... food is good."}
{"text":"Loved this place and I don't even like pizza all that much! The workers were super helpful at guiding me through all the options (too many IMO) since I had never been here before. And everyone was so nice.

I chose the gluten free crust which I am about 99% sure was an Udi's crust based on the fact that it was precooked and ingredients sounded the same. But that's ok, I don't mind Udi's. 

Lots of toppings to choose from. Los of sauce options, lots of crust topping options like olive oil, melted butter etc.

Basically, if you don't like your pizza, it's your own fault because you picked it."}
{"text":"Pizza joints are all over the place and it is very difficult to find one that truly stands out.  Look no further.  My husband and I started our date night out here and it was literally a food-gasm.  The pizza is made right in front of you, exactly as you order it, and placed in an open fire oven.  I am not at all a fan of thin crust pizza, but I totally ate my words last night.  The price is so affordable that you can bring the entire family.  I also indulged in a side salad and was very pleasantly surprised in the size for the price.  Colin was exceptional with his Customer service and excitement for our first experience there.  Job well done Pieology.  We will be regular patrons."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty for fast food Pizza. You get to customize your pizza...awesome!!! The garlic butter and marinara is yummy. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I use to eat here 2-3 times a month. Then they started being out of essential toppings. Didn't come in for 4 months. I came back the end of March arms they were fully stocked for toppings. Tonight I waited 12 minutes in line and, once again, they are out of onions and regular crust and who knows what else. I didn't bother any further. I left and went next door to Five Guys. At  least they stock their ingredients."}
{"text":"I was actually about to go to Chipotle next door and forgot they were still building last I remembered. This is so cool! For what you can get & the options they have for the price you pay is just too good. I think what really made me write this review is the service. It's just a casual pizza place but EVERYONE was so nice & friendly. All guys that worked were super polite & all of them were smiling. There was a certain guy that was very pleasant, I wish I got his name but he had facial hair, that's all I remember! He stood out the most to me because he was friendly to everyone, he seemed to be expediting in all areas & I loved his sense of urgency because the place was busy. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Seriously, what restaurant fast food or otherwise doesn't have a unsweetened iced tea? Make half a drum if it isn't selling well. Which seems crazy to me by the way. I enjoy the pizza but wish they had sautéed onions. Love me some onions on my pizza. Takes a long time to get the pizza most times. I will usually order online and pick it up but even then I have had to wait. Overall it's a good work lunch kinda place."}
{"text":"Slow service, tables were messy/dirty, nothing on tables(no red pepper, parmesan cheese, salt, pepper).

and if that wasn't bad enough there was at least two employees that were sitting and eating on breaks while the line was getting longer and the tables were left in this condition. Where was the management?"}
{"text":"It was my first time here. The pizza here was pretty good. The toppings were really good however the sauce for the pizza was really lacking which made it seem a little dry and lacking the full flavor. I would however go back again but this time ask for extra sauce if it's an option."}
{"text":"The Skinny: cardboard crust and bland toppings with inconsistent crust makes for a less than awesome experience (2).service is okay and counter service (3) value: although $8 for unlimited toppings on your toppings seem fair, the lackluster/inconsistent cooking method just doesn't do it for me (2).

I've tried this place a few times and each time I come away with feeling like there is something missing. 

Normally,  I love thinner crust pizza. But I find the crust here rather flavorless and cardboard like in consistency. It doesn't even have the flakiness of a true cracker crust. 

I have tried their herb butter and red sauce. Neither one is inspiring and both taste bland. The cheese blends are also pretty boring flavorwise. 

The toppings also fall flat for me. The proteins -  ham, sausage,  etc tastes too generic. The veggies are kind of basic as well. 

When my order gets fired, I usually get either a super burnt edges (despite the oiling of the crust) or I get soggy in the middle (with me really restraining myself with toppings. Eh,  just not my cup of tea.  2 starred review."}
{"text":"I've been to 3 or 4 places that do what Pieology does but no place in Vegas does it better than Pieology!

The dough and toppings are so delicious. I'm a big eater so I get annoyed when the serving sizes suck. I've been to this location twice now and both times they were generous with the toppings. Didn't leave me hanging so I got great nice and full. 

And best of all, I paid $8.60 with tax! That really can't be beaten for filling lunch. If you haven't been here, GO! I'll definitely be headed back as soon as I get a chance. Luckily my office is conveniently located right down the street!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was legit. Madison's service was even better. Thanks for the cups"}
{"text":"Best place for pizzas, unlimited toppings, freshly made pizzas, coming here for past 3 years it used to be called project pie, quality stays the same 
Very hard working friendly staff 
We come here once every time we are in vegas"}
{"text":"Pieology Pizzeria has really good pizza. We went to the grand opening and it was a great experience. I was very impressed how well they were prepared for a grand opening. Even though there were a lot of people the line moved quickly and we didn't have to wait too long to get our food. Everything in the restaurant is new and super clean. I liked the simple decorations they had as well.

Their menu is straightforward and easy. You can pretty much get any pizza with anything on it for one price. There are a few pre-built options to choose from. I hope to go back next time to try some of the desserts!

The staff was amazing. They were attentive and always there to help customers with anything we needed. 

I would recommend everyone to try this place out. They are definitely worth the time and money to check them out."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first; after skimming the yelp photos and restaurant website I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary here, but I decided to give it a try since the reviews were so good. 
What a surprise, my pizza was great! The staff was very friendly, greeting everyone as they entered and thanking them as they left. You order at the counter and choose your type of dough, sauce, cheese and toppings. The best thing about it was the unlimited toppings! The pizza was $7.95 and I was able to add whatever I wanted ranging from traditional pizza toppings to unique extras like kalamata olives, banana peppers, ricotta cheese, or gorgonzola, just to name a few, as well as a great selection of meats. They stick it in the oven and in about 5 minutes they deliver it to your table. 
The crust was very thin and golden brown, cooked perfectly. The sauce was surprisingly flavorful, and the toppings were fresh. 
I struggled to eat the entire thing by myself, it was larger than the average personal sized pizza. They also have a menu featuring specialty pizzas that are a couple dollars more. If I find myself in the area again I will definitely return for a pizza."}
{"text":"Love the custom made pizza it something I would go back on a regular basics. Make your own pizza and super cheap. 
Can't help that the edges get burn since I hate it but other then that. 
Making your own pizza and how much you want o it is the best part for the same price."}
{"text":"We placed an order for pick-up (which was very easy to do online). We requested a pick-up time and arrived on the nose - the pizza was cold. This could be part of why we didn't love this pizza. Two of our pizzas were Gluten Free, the dough was a standard GF option, nothing exceptional. A bit sweet tasting. The center was very soggy. The veggie toppings were still completely raw. I prefer my onion, peppers and mushrooms to be cooked with the pizza, not just thrown on after. We also had a regular BBQ Chicken pizza. It was NOT good. My husband  only ate two pieces of it and threw the rest away. That was a bummer. I'd be willing to try this place again....but so far, it just didn't wow me."}
{"text":"I actually enjoy this place. There are some reviews out there that are not too happy about this place.

But I'm happy enough to give them 4 stars. Yes, the lines are sometimes out the door but the wait is worth it. 

For about $8, you get to build your own pizza. It's either go minimalist with just different cheeses or ask for all the toppings. 

This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love the whole wheat crust and all the different toppings I can put on my pizza! Fast and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Another bookmark checked off! I have always wanted to check out Pieology not only cause it has a strong rating on yelp but also fan of building your own pizza. Use to be place that really enjoy that recently closed down few months ago close too my house. Same concept. So when I heard about this new place one that apparently started in CA and reading the reviews got me excited about pizza again. Not that my normal favorite spots are broke but always refreshing when you can come up with your own idea for pizza and taste it first hand. At Pieology Pizzeria they have a very good selection of toppings straight across the board from cheeses, meats, vegetables, and too many for me mention by name. Choices for sauces again nice selection.  Nothing really exotic over the top high end toppings just in case looking make fine dining pie. Simple pizza with three of less toppings is rule live by with my pizza but more so since all the pizza here are thin crust style. The amount of toppings I had felt like they put good amount on my pie although less/simple not exactly your two handfuls of toppings. Too each his own....

I came up with artichoke, pepperoni, sausage, and jalapeño. Red sauce as the base. I was thinking meat lovers with kick (jalapeño) and twist (artichoke). I liked it! Really no limits with the idea one can come up with at Pieology. Or you can always go with your classics or they have some pizza that can choose from off the menu. NO fun in that just go with your imagination.

The service felt was wonderful. Two different people as they were making my pie awesome. No rushing me. First timer so was explaining everything to me clearly and fun talk too. 

The restaurant is find your own seat. I like the open air feeling of the place and some of the black and white photos as art decor on one wall. The wall with all the Quotes!!!! I LOVED THAT IDEA!!! It located in new downtown summerlin mall. So easy access right off the 215."}
{"text":"Errrr, who came up with this concept???! AW-some! Unlimited toppings for one SMALL price. I kept waiting for \"the catch\". But excuse me, there isn't one! My pizza was at the table in less than 5 minutes after I sat down. Granted, I couldnt decide on which fountain drink I wanted, had to choose condiments, a straw, napkins, dry pepper, cheese, etc. But all jokes aside, this place rocks! Go staff! ...All 50 of you guys who were at the counter waiting to take orders and add toppings to that raw dough."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot! My son loved the concept of being able to make his own pizza. Reminded me of a chipotle with the way it moves you down the line as you add more to your pizza. 

They have a variety of sauces, cheeses, meats and toppings. You can definitely make an assortment of pizzas, flavors and creations. My son loved that he could put more parmesan on his mozzarella.

It is a laid back restaurant and the atmosphere matches. The service was also on point. If you have never been there it can be a buy overwhelming, the menu from the beginning can be an eye opener but once you get started they all help you along the way (in respect to ordering).

The pizza came out pretty quick and were really good. Only thing is the crust was super thin, not sure if they offer thicker crust. So if you don't love thin crust this may not be the spot for you. 

If you are at downtown summerlin stop by!"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious, make your own style 
It tastes great, is super thin, and extra crispy
The only thing is that the service is a little slow, but once you get the pizza it is totally worth it!!
There are also really nice quotes that cover the walls which adds a fun thing to read while waiting/eating"}
{"text":"It tasted good, I personally like Fired Pie better. It's a little bit further so my intention is not to take business from anyone, just my personal preference. And Fired Pie was there first. I liked MOD overall. The staff was friendly and everything was clean. I must say, I did have diarreah pretty bad after eating here.  It could have been something else I ate, but, certain restaurants do that. My Dr said I am highly sensitive to MSG and many restaraunts have MSG in the ingredients, even unknowingly (MSG can be hidden and disguised in other ingredients). My husband ate with me, he liked it a lot and also liked it better than Fired Pie. He loves Siracha and ranch, they offer it after your pizza is made. He was happy."}
{"text":"Do not go there thinking you will get a nice wood fired or coal fired pizza, the oven is just made to look that way, it is a gas open deck oven. They managed to get a made to order frozen tasting pizza down. I ordered a bacon and sausage pizza WELL DONE, it came out closer to raw than done. the toppings were tasteless too boot. It is cheap so you get what you pay for. Was very disappointed and will not return, they managed to bring Subway style to Pizza. But with less taste"}
{"text":"Great place for quick lunch... great service... shout out to Romeo.. always on top of it."}
{"text":"Great pizza, the fact that you can customize it for a certain price, even better. Clean and well organized location as well. 
Only thing I did not like was the cashier's attitude. So rude and not friendly at all, once my friends and I got back to wait for our pizza, all of us agreed that was just not the proper way to treat us."}
{"text":"It was fair for being new. Not super crowded for being dinner time on a Friday night. They had way more staff on hand than what they actually needed. The \"chef\" was not the best, both of our pizzas came out black on the bottom. If they refine their team and cooking skills, they will be just fine."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here before catching a movie at Chandler mall. We left amazed at what a great experience it was. The price is right, the pizza was fantastic. I got a good sized pizza with a pile of toppings for $10 including tax. I took a lot of it home. And it was delicious! I got their new thick crust, it was crispy and wonderful.

I told the owner that some of the reviews said their pizza was soggy, he said pizza is a matter of personal taste on how well it should be done and that they are always happy to leave a pizza in a little longer if someone wants it crispier. Kayla took my order, and she was super nice, and Michael brought me my pizza. I accidentally asked him for extra mozzarella instead of marinara, he happily brought the cheese but when he overheard me telling my friend I'd asked for the wrong thing he brought the marinara too.

The food was excellent and the people were fantastic! I'll be going to this place again and again."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I had! I had to eat it twice! I didn't know Vegas had such good pizza. This was a first time visit and it was so good that I returned a second time. Everything was hot and fresh. They also had a very good variety of toppings to pick from. You were always greeted with a smile. I would definitely return and highly recommend. Very inexpensive as well."}
{"text":"When I heard that a Pieology was in Chandler, I was so excited! I love that you can customize your pizza for only $8. The options are endless and there are many toppings you can choose from! I'm also curious with their personalized salads. Had a good experience  and can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"First timer today, I must say I received exceptional service from Joanna (hopefully that's correct). Great customer service is rare these days, and she went above and beyond to welcome me to the place. Thank you, I'll be back."}
{"text":"The best gluten free pizza in Vegas- hands down.  Okay so Vegas is NOT a great place to have issues with gluten, so I was so happy to find this little pizza place where I could enjoy my favorite food- PIzza.  It's a nice touch that you can actually watch them build the pizza and the service was fast and the employees were super nice.  I will definitely stop back here either tomorrow or the next time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a great experience. If you like Pizza then you must give this place a try! Very clear and bright atmosphere with inspirational sayings on the walls and plenty of open tables and booths for small or large group gatherings. 
Here is how it works...you go up to the ordering station...there are several options on the menu that are 'preselected'. You might select a standard personal size pepperoni pizza or cheese pizza. Which are great selections. However, here is where this place shines...you can make your own pizza! Yes, that's right! you can verbally craft it right there just as if you were making it yourself! And the fire up the pizza right in front of you! There are a lot of different toppings so if you want that rare elusive pineapple and anchovy combination....this is the place for you! I will definitely be bringing others here for lunch! 
It is worth noting that the quality of pizza here is 'different' that if you go to a Chicago or New York style pizza joint. It is 'faster' food. So the type of pizza served here is simply different than the aforementioned styles of pizza. 
That being said Pieology is pizza done right because it is designed by you! Come on by and get a pie!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place and I tried it because it was high on \"Yelp\".

I don't have anything bad to say about this place so here is everything good you need to know.

1.  Cheap.   8$ for all the toppings you want for a 11 inch pizza.  Sign me up!!

2.  Fantastic tasting pizza..  

3.  Great atmosphere.

4.  Quick!!

I love meat so I put all the options on my pizza and opted to not have olive oil on the crust, I wanted it a little burnt and it was Awesome.

Come and eat here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Hey I really dig these make-it-to-order pizza joints.  I stopped in today and ordered the classic margherita plus artichokes.  The employees greet people right away, and I like the clean, sunny room.  

Initially they seemed to be a little disorganized on keeping track of whose pizza was where in the oven, but that should work itself out in time.  They tried to give me Ed's pizza, and Ed's pizza looked pretty good, full of meat, mushrooms, and olives, but I'm not Ed.  

I took my pie home to scarf in private and really enjoyed the flavors.  The garlicky olive oil is very nice and fresh tomatoes and basil make for a perfect mix of flavors.  I just think the grape tomatoes might not be the best idea.  They fall off easily.  Some sliced romas might work out better.

The crust was crisp and buttery, just like I like it.  Overall this is a great addition to all the restaurants by the mall.  And the price...can't beat the price...$7.95 plus tax equals a pizza for $8.57, and I only ate half of it, I swear!"}
{"text":"The best pizza for sure... and the customer service was excellent. All employees were so sweet polite and made our pizza to perfection. Even when we were eating one of the employee stopped by to check on us. I would definitely go back and the place is super organized and clean"}
{"text":"I love this pizza. Very good quality. Not happy that on this specific occasion, Saturday evening, there were only 2 people working. The wait was longer than usual. Kuddos to the 2 young ladies working the line, they had a good attitude. Get these girls some more help!!"}
{"text":"7.95 for a personal size pizza with unlimited topping!? Best place to go to, especially if you love thin crust pizza, still crunchy and straight out of the oven on to the table. You really can't go wrong with this place, especially since you get to choose what toppings you like on it."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened. This place used to be so good. I didn't recognize any of the staff so I don't know if it's under new management or something. The guys just didn't seem that concerned with taking their time to make my pizzas well. They also don't have shaved Parmesan anymore which sucks. Everything was just lacking. So disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome concept, the pizza version of subway! Unlimited topping everything was fresh and tasted awesome!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I went to pieology a few times within the first couple of weeks after it opened and immediately became a fan. I loved how fast my pizza cooked and the unlimited toppings, the people working the line are always friendly and it is super cheap - $7.95 for a larger size personal pizza. 
But honestly I am writing this review because I have experienced bad customer service here. One of the people who I assume to be a manager (I assume they were a manager- they had on a different shirt than the others working) was laughing and gossiping about customers the last time I came in. I normally am not one to point fingers, but I am very sure of what I heard and I am very disappointed in pieology as a company for choosing people who talk anything other than decently about guests -regardless of their actions or demeanors - as their leaders. I joined yelp to write this review because I was so disappointed in what I overheard. I really hope corporate sees this and makes note of it. 

Other than that, the employees making the pizzas are very attentive and cheerful and are always cleaning tables and interacting positively with those enjoying their pizzas. I felt welcomed by everyone while I was moving though the toppings and even the person at the register was nice and full of smiles, and that feeling continued on while I was eating, as I was asked if I needed anything else and if the pizza was good, which it was. Overall: good pizza, questionable management"}
{"text":"We went to Pieology Pizzeria in surprise, several time and  staff who know asl commutation her name is McKenna doing great asl commutation.  Can recommend deaf people joining this restaurant cuz alots of deaf people who lives in surprise, sun city grand and sun city west too they can asl  fluent singers  to employees what they want orders help way communication for them .  Suggest McKenna teach staff to learning asl fluent singers. Also we recommend deaf can work employees with them more fun communication each other with asl fluent singers. They can do it."}
{"text":"Love the options for the price! Pizza is big enough to share. Salads were fresh tasting. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here before we were headed out from Vegas. No regrets! Pizza and all the ingredients were fresh and on point. Staff were friendly and helpful. If you are in Vegas it's worth a stop if you are craving some good fresh pizza."}
{"text":"I like the fact you can build your pizza any way you want for one price. Its quick and tastes really good."}
{"text":"Good pizza, love the thin crust and how it stays crispy even with a load of toppings. The price for a customizable pie with unlimited toppings is cheaper than other places with similar concepts ($7.99). Service seemed average, not bad, not great, but decent. We always hit this place up on our way to Red Rock Resort."}
{"text":"I work in the same office complex and eat here on average at least once a month.  The restaurant is clean, the service is quick, and the food is delicious.  There is often a line because of how popular it is, but it is worth the wait.  

My recommendation--a whole wheat crust, marinara, mozzarella, pepperoni, and veggies to suit--including the sun-ripened tomatoes."}
{"text":"Ordered off Uber Eats while at a local hotel. Not sure what the hype is about. Their food was below average and just slightly above disgusting. I'll stick with MOD and Fired Pie."}
{"text":"Rude. Wow. Pizza was a disaster. Sauce guy was rude, slopped sauce in the middle and over one edge with 1/3 of the pizza... No sauce. Very skimpy when asking for ricotta, even with it being the only cheese requested. I asked for more and got no response, just a pile of ricotta smacked onto the pizza and it was then passed down the line. Well, thank you, sir. The next girl asked what I wanted. I said basil. She then asked if that was all before I even had a chance to ask for anything else. I said no and asked for garlic. She grabbed a handful and it ended up in three piles (big piles) on the pizza. I kind of chuckled and asked if she could spread it out a bit. Again, no response, she didn't want to spread it out so I got just another pile of garlic and an evil look. Two incredibly rude employees and a crappy looking pizza. I should've taken a picture, but instead I stood there for at least 2 minutes before another guy asked me if I would like anything else. I politely explained that it was a disaster and when I asked the girl to change the garlic it did not work out for me, among other things. At this point I didn't even know what to do, this was a first for me. Obviously these ppl could not have cared less. I told the man that I did not want it and was going to leave. He asked to remake it and the girl that messed part of it up gave me a very evil look and made some comment as well. This place is similar to Blaze Pizza. The idea is the only thing similar though! Blaze is amazing, not only great pizza but great people!! I would never recommend Pieology and will definitely not give it another shot."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I absolutely love it. There was no confusion, it was really easy to get what we wanted. We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time coming here with my boyfriend and his son. I am not a big pizza person but personalizing your own pizza? why not? You walk in and your server will already have the pizza dough waiting for you, you choose what sauce you want. Ranging from red sauce or alfredo sauce. Then you choose what kind of cheese you would like, and here is the best part, loading it up with all your favorite toppings. I'd say the size of the pizza is a personal, but you can share with someone. They bake your pizza in an over right in front of you and it does not take long. This location is big with outside seating. It was very clean inside which is always my number 1 concern. They just opened this Pieology maybe like 1-2 months ago and I love it."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at Pieology and I was super impressed! First off, I noticed that the restaurant was clean and orderly and I liked the decor. The employees were super nice and helpful, and you can tell that they hire with high standards. I've was super surprised by how many toppings they put on the pizza! They really load it on there! It was nice that they don't skimp at all. It really is unlimited toppings! They have a lot of options as far as crust, sauce, toppings and more. What a great place! I love that when we took it to go, they showed us our pizzas, boxed them up, and then offered us more cheese, peppers and a bag to carry it all. Very great customer service and food!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and WISH WISH WISH they will bring one to Centennial Hills. The staff is always pleasant and attentive. I first fell in love with the franchise in California and have been a pieology resident ever since. Keep up the good work and keep those pizzas coming."}
{"text":"First Timer; excellent pizza, fair price, excellent toppings, can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"We visited for the $5 Monday special. It was pretty busy because of that. If it wasn't for the special, we would go to Blaze Pizza less than a 1/2 mile away. This Pieology location is not very good. The workers look very unhappy to be working there. They make the customers almost feel bad for asking for more toppings. They're not necessarily rude....but just angry looking. Three girl putting our toppings on yawned as she unenthusiasticly put on our toppings. Asking her to add more toppings than what she put was like asking her to work overtime. I'm sure they were just stressed because it was busy though. The restaurant was not very clean. The restrooms smelled like urine and the trashcan was overflowing. Like I mentioned before, if I want to go to a build your own pizza place in the future, I will go to Blaze.....unless it's a Monday. 

Pizza was decent and it filled me up. It was good to have pizza on a Monday night."}
{"text":"My wife said she was craving pizza again. After going to Pizza Rev the week before, I told my wife to try pieology. I would pretty much repeat my review for Pizza Rev and say you can't beat the price.  The place was also very clean and service was fast. I would say its a tie between this place and Pizza Rev."}
{"text":"The pizza is off the hook. Great people who work there. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. It's a must eat place when visiting Downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Good pizza really liked it and good service too. Really loved the inspirational wall I want that wall in my house."}
{"text":"What a joke. Dirty store, out of everything and clueless 17 year olds running the place with no apparent manager. $22 foe 2 side salads and a drink. Never again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I am a pizza fanatic and the fact that vegan cheese here is not an added charge and they have so many veggie toppings makes this place beat out pizzarev for me. However, I find that this location is a really good one as other pieologies are not nearly as good."}
{"text":"Didn't like this place at first... Now I LOVE IT!

Food (4 stars): I am a HUGE fan of Blaze pizza and this place comes close! I love how thin the slices are. You can focus all the flavoring on the toppings without getting sick of the dough taste. Also very little crust for crust haters like me! Haha My pizza was a little on the more burnt side but my friend's pizza was not burned so it was probably an accident. They have a good variety of toppings! Sadly, they don't have spicy red sauce :(

Service (5 stars): Super fast and quick because they cook it right away. Workers are really nice here! We connected because we were both from inland empire LOL"}
{"text":"I DIDNT ASK FOR BURNT TOPPINGS!!! Honestly who would even eat this. I think this picture speaks for itself on the quality at this pieology!!! DO NOT COME HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Food is always great. Love the vegan cheese option. The only complaint is that workers should br a little more informed about the vegan options. 
And some of your staff is great I think his name is Kevin tall guy. He knew exactly what is vegan and what was not. Great customer service for that guy. But for the other girls. No smiles, always felt being rushed through the line. Seems like they don't want to be here and has a pissed of face."}
{"text":"Wow.  Totally discussed on my purchase and no telephone number on the receipt(WHO Does that). Take my money and I can't speak to a live person. Yuck"}
{"text":"Ever since I went to Irvine spectrum to try their pieology there I was obsessed with the idea of a quick pizza place styled like chipotle where you could just walk right in, pick your toppings and go. Finally we get one for Vegas! I tried their roasted veggie and had the other half styled alfredo. The alfredo had a little too much garlic and wasn't really evenly spread out but was still good, and the roasted veggie was nice and had a little sweetness thanks to the corn on top but I didn't really like how it was a little soggy and watery.. But then again you can't always have perfection. I could tell the worker also was inexperienced as well since she kept looking back and forth at the recipe instructions to see what goes on the pizza we were ordering so that might of also contributed to the unevenly spread of toppings. The flavor was over all pretty good, and the prices are pretty reasonable considering I'd pay the same price at chipotle. If you haven't been yet, I recommend going at least once. They are a newer establishment so I think i'll give them a little more time to get settled in and when they do, Ill probably try it again."}
{"text":"In short, Pieology is delicious and catered to your taste by friendly and responsive team members! They have gluten free options, which is shocking for a pizza place but really commendable. I love the constant pricing setup they have, because customers then have an opportunity to treat themselves without an added hit to the wallet. There's nothing quite like craving pizza, pointing to toppings and sauces and seeing it in front of you just minutes later, without even sacrificing a double digit cash amount. The portions are good enough to easily turn your experience into a double down dinner. In other words, I have dinner two nights in a row or I even enough to go a whole day without a stomach rumble. I always love finding my way to Pieology!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me a lot of the new trending pizza restaurants except for you save a little more pocket change here. Good pizza, okay toppings, great crust. I'd go here again for sure"}
{"text":"This place comes up with fake promotions and various schemes to get guests to give them 5 stars. They make promises a free food and free pizza and then when it comes time to collect, good luck.   While this pizza chain is not so bad overall this location truly sucks. 

They simply don't want to honor anything that they offer to get customers in the door.  Typical bate and switch.  They send out free promotions and discounts and then when you get to the store they say forget it.  Another mistake, Internet error, excuses, excuses, excuses.   They are not honest. 

All the reviews here are from all the other Yelp  people who were promised free pizza to lie and give 5 stares.  All these good reviews are fake.  

Let's talk food, not bad, not that great.  However service sold C-.   

Lots of food choices in this area.   Last time I waste my lunch on this pizza joint.  Seriously I don't like feeling scammed they got one on me this time. This is a true and honest review I did not get any free pizza for leaving five stars."}
{"text":"Picture a Chipotle but with pizza. You can be creative and customize your individual 11.5 inch pizza here with unlimited toppings for $7.95. You start with a choice of regular, cracker thin crust (thinner crust than Grimaldi's) or gluten free for $2 extra. Then pick your sauce - red, herb butter, or olive oil.  I chose the traditional marinara sauce and the employee put an olive oil base before lathering on the sauce.

Next comes the cheese which includes mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta, feta, and gorgonzola. Then you choose the meats (bacon, pepperoni, sausage, meatball), veggies, herbs, and a flavor blast (pesto, buffalo, ranch, etc). 

I went with the regular crust with red sauce, ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, pepperoni, meatball, jalapeños, & mushrooms. No herbs and flavor blast this time. 

Obviously, your pizza will take a few minutes so take a # and wait patiently for your pizza. My customized pizza was delicious! Check out my pizza!"}
{"text":"First this place has got the best service! Food is absolutely good and would recommend anyone to come try."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very friendly staff! If you want a nice sized customized pizza for yourself or to share, come here!"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious, service was lacking.  The ingredients were so fresh and tasty and the crust was cooked to perfection.  I will say that they went a little light on the toppings.  My daughters were fighting over the slices that had mushrooms on them as several of their pieces had no mushrooms.  My pizza was the same.  It still tasted great! 

Now, I know this location is new and they were training new employees while we were in there so I take that with a grain of salt.  The girl taking our order was so soft spoken that I had to have her repeat everything she said.  The gentleman that dropped our pizza off asked if we needed anything to which I replied \"just some plates please\".  He immediately forgot and after waiting, I got back up and went to the counter to ask for the plates.  He told me he forgot (I appreciate the honesty).  

We will definitely give it another try once they have been open for a while."}
{"text":"There was a joint up the road from my office called \"Custom Built Pizza\" that closed down recently.  It was one of my fave lunch spots and I have been in a state of depression for months.  Until now.  Pieology!  

This place has really, really ridiculously good pizza that you can custom make however you like.  Add as much of whatever toppings, cheese, veggies, etc.   The crust is thin and crispy and they are ready to eat in about 5 minutes.   

I love the food - no issues whatsoever with the grub. It's good, darn good.  I have two very minor complaints.  The first complaint is outside of their control.  The parking sucks.  The lot directly north of the restaurant is always full at lunch and dinner time.  The next closest lot requires walking across the busy road that leads into Downtown Summerlin.  It's not a deal breaker but you will have to dodge a few cars.   Second, the restaurant is noisy and I don't mean just a little bit.  Every surface in the place is hard and industrial and sounds just bounces around.  Being there for lunch can induce a migraine.  They need to install some sound absorbing panels to quiet the place down.  

Other than those minor quibbles, this place is well worth a visit.   I've been 4 times since it opened.  Good pizza never gets old, and Pieology has good pizza."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this  pizzeria. I must say the customer service was exceptional. The staff made ordering extremely easy. I love the fact that you could customize your pizza with as many toppings as you want. I opted for their specialty veggie pizza with added sausage. 

I just randomly found this place while on my way to a hair appointment in the area.

It was delicious and I'll definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I thought this pizza was delicious!  Better than their competitors.  My son was a little freaked out because his was dark around the edges.  So when I got home I just cut his edge off.  I am glad there is another great place to eat.  Clean, and refreshing."}
{"text":"After becoming a regular at Fired Pie, I was looking forward to trying another location with a similar style. Unfortunately, this is NOT Fired Pie. 

First -One pizza we had the regular crust which was flavorless. Think frozen pizza. The other was a whole grain crust. I thought it was funny when the girl said it tastes just like regular crust. Umm...it shouldn't and it doesn't. Sadly, it didn't taste the same but was still not good. 

Next - they put on WAY too much sauce, even as we were telling her LIGHT sauce. They don't have \"fresh mozzarella\" as an option here (which is soooo good!) I'm spoiled and want my fresh mozzarella I admit it. 

Lastly - one piece of meat in each slice of pizza. One. Seriously?? 

We each ate a minimal amount. My husband threw his away. I couldn't just toss it after just one piece so I boxed the rest and took it home. Every time I looked at it in the 'fridge my stomach said \"Nooo, you don't want to eat that!\"  Eventually I tried one of the pieces of Canadian bacon then threw the rest away. 

I see people really like this place but I've been spoiled. I simply can't enjoy a cheap pizza that tastes cheap, no matter how many toppings I can put on it."}
{"text":"It was the best of Pies. It was the worst of Pies. It was age of...

When we were in the OC a while back, we were looking forward to ordering a pizza from Pieology in the Irvine Spectrum. We had read so many positive reviews about their \"brand\", we couldn't wait. 

Well, let's say it was a dud. Screaming kids, disinterested employees, managers running around cleaning tables and the most disgusting prep area with everything mixed together. The fact that our pizza order was goofed up was the smallest issue. The size for that location was tiny and over crowded. 

Okay, with that backdrop and with much trepidation I came here for lunch yesterday at 2:30. Whoa, what a difference. First, the interior was cavernous, as my photos I hope shows.  Second everything was immaculate. Really, you could eat off the floors and that was after a busy lunch hour. 

I give the credit to all this to their management team and Mike (see photo) their handlebar mustache leader and head Pie-Oologist.  We had a chance to chat, turns out he trained in their Irvine and Tustin locations.  Clearly he learned a lot because I came away impressed. In making my pie. he threw away five dough palates as not being made right.  Wow, great quality control!

I ordered a meat pie with garlic, spicy marinara and banana peppers.  It was outstanding and only $7.95.  I'm glad I tried this Pieology because it lives up to their reputation.  Thank you, Mike!  So, Four and Half Stars, bordering on Five."}
{"text":"We enjoy the make your own oven fried pizza places and this is one of our favorites.  Friendly service and clean restaurant.  

Tried the whole wheat crust today for the first time and it was delish!  Held up well and had a nice crisp to it.

My favorite toppings combo: herb butter, mozzarella, shaved parm, spinach, onion, basil, sausage, Italian herbs and olive oil drizzled on top and brushed around the crust.  Yum! 

#winfreepieologypizza contest going on through May 20th!"}
{"text":"HeyTeam! HeyTeam! HeyTeam! 
A fantastic first day review for you and a first visit for us! The pizza was prepared well and exactly what I've come to expect from Pieology.  All team members were all smiles and positive energy!  

My fav is the wheat crust with herb butter, light on the sausage and onion and mozzarella, parmesan, oregano, basil, artichokes and roasted red peppers.  My husband loves the wheat crust as well topped with many of the meats.  The thin crusts cook up crisp enough to hold the toppings nicely and not fall off when you pick up a slice.  

There are a few tables outside and in the shade for the dinner hour.  

When we first moved to AZ over three years ago we found Pieology in Avondale and have visited at least every other month.  Now that Pieology is in our own backyard we are SO EXCITED and will likely be in much more often!! 

Since this is their first week of business please be patient.   There are more crew members on shift than normal due to training and high customer volume.  For the time we were there on June 1 the lines were consistently long, chairs and tables were at a premium and the drink fountain was empty of a couple of things.   HOWEVER, the staff were very responsive to questions, requests and refilling the drink fountain as fast as possible - all with a smile! 

Recommendation for management - the email based PieLife profile preferences have the Surprise location as an option to select. However, the Pieology app has no AZ locations at all to select."}
{"text":"Love the food! Never had a bad experience very yummy!!  I will be coming back for more!  Customer service was amazing!!!!! Always so so so so so so so good!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few other Pieology locations in the past in California and I was thrilled to find out that there was a location in Las Vegas that wasn't in Summerlin! 

Pieology is one of my favorite pizza places ever. You choose as many toppings as you want all for a little less than $8, and it's a good sized pizza. You can eat it all by yourself or you can share it with someone and you'd be satisfied either way. 

The pizza itself, with as many toppings as you like, is delicious! I had the herb butter with all the cheese and a few vegetables and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm always happy when I come into pieology and this time was no exception!"}
{"text":"Loving it-always personal pizzas special to order with fresh ingredients right there in front of you. My son gets a meat lovers and I get the whole veggie pizza here that even fits the vegan category. This place is a weekly stop turn long work out"}
{"text":"A must try.  Build your own masterpiece.  Fresh ingredients.  Great ownership and priced right.  $11 bucks feeds two people.  Clean an friendly.  I'm hooked"}
{"text":"I love this place! You can order a pizza like a sub!
And it's priced very reasonable and delicious!
A family take out plus! Good job!!"}
{"text":"Besides the long wait to finish my pizza, the two girls on shift were a little to flirty with their male clients but ignored their female customers. This is not a quick stop but instead their pizzas take as long as at a traditional restaurant to prepare."}
{"text":"Decent food but what kind of business doesn't adequately A/C their facility? I want to have my pizza put in the oven and then be able to eat it and enjoy it OUTSIDE the oven. Building way too hot. Will not be returning. You save money on being cheap, but lose customers for it too. Also they asked if I wanted the high rise crust or flat - I answered original (which the sign clearly says) and I got a disgusted face in return when \"flat\" isn't even listed on the sign.  Had to repeat myself 3 times to have pepperoni added to my pie. Also no military discount? Me and all my fellow troops are happy to take our business to Blaze Pizza where the food tastes better, we don't sweat while we eat, and are charged less. Poor people skills and customer service. I heard a different couple ask if they could lower the A/C and they said that \"it's already set to 68 and between the outside and heat of the oven, that it's impossible to keep it cool.\" Other establishments in the Valley manage to do it so that was absurd to hear from an employee. The business owner may already know though - yelp is already onto them for inflating/giving themselves fake positive reviews (I attached the image). This locations stars are probably much closer to a 2 star average. Also, the forks and knives are all put in the reservoir upside-down so that every customer has to touch the prongs and blades of every other future customers utensils (disgusting and unsanitary)."}
{"text":"I don't know how I ever lived without the thick crust pizza in my life. This Pieology just opened and I've been there 10 or more times already. The pepperoni they have is just the right amount of spiciness and gets that crisp edge to each piece... Absolutely perfect. Customer service is top notch. I think the owner, Kris was in there one time and had the crew firing on all cylinders. I will continue to be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 pizzas and a large salad. When i put the salad in a bowl it was really slimy and old. The pepperoni pizza was way too spicy too eat, the veggie pizza was very bland and tasteless. The ranch dressing tasted generic like it came out of a bottle. When i called to tell a manager, he was very unhelpful and did not offer to make things right. I am VERY disappointed and will NEVER come back to this place. Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"I NEVER give poor reviews. But this was so miserable it needed to be addressed in hopes that positive changes come to the store. First of all, as we approached the counter, the guy making our pizza was not helpful at all when we were confused how to order and just stood there. As we were paying the guy at the register was less than enthused to say the least. Barely opening his mouth to ask if we wanted a drink. As we sat down, the floor was filthy. Completely covered with pizza crumbs, toppings and whatever other litter the store had to offer. It was all stuck to the bottom of our shoes. The tables were no cleaner might I add and scattered with chairs all over the place. Finally the pizza arrived and was under cooked and wet. The bottom of the pizza was covered with ash as if the oven had not been cleaned in quite awhile (picture included having already cleaned most of hand). Other locations are not like this at all. I don't know if it's poor management or what but I really hope this is fixed.

Also forgot to add as we were leaving, employee sneezed, wiped his nose with his hand and continued to work without washing his hands. I don't know what this place is honestly."}
{"text":"Not my favorite of the design your own pizza places.

Nice that they have gluten free.  I also liked the sparkling grapefruit juice.

The toppings weren't that exciting and the flavor not that good.

Eklectic Pie in Gilbert is my #1 favorite - whole roasted garlic topping and great prices!
The Pizza Press outside Disneyland is my #2 - huge pepperoni slices
Pizza Studio in downtown Phoenix is my #3
Fired Pie is my #4
Pieology is last place of the ones I've tried #5"}
{"text":"Pizza was hot and tasty. Staff is in training, but we're happy and helpful. VERY thin crust, like a crisp flatbread. Will be a regular stop for my 15 year old. Pizza in 4 minutes, winner."}
{"text":"Pieology was OK ..I would prefer mod pizza over Pieology... MOD PIZZA the pies are a little bigger than Pieology's and they seem to have a bit more ingredients ...I felt like Pieology was a little Lacking with their ingredients and the size of their pies are a bit smaller.... but I guess since I don't have a MOD PIZZA that Close to the house I'm going to have to settle with this when I can't get to MOD Pizza......Pieology we will definitely be back I do like to give people And places second and third and fourth chances and I know it was the first day I'm sorry I will redo my review the next time we come in"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Pieology and was pleasantly surprised. I was sort of expecting a pizza equivalent to a Subway sub. Thankfully that's not even close to the case here. The pizzas are very tasty. I had spicy buffalo sauce, Parmesan and mozzarella cheese and spicy chicken pieces. The pizza came after about 3 or 4 minutes and was perfectly cooked; very crunchy thin crust. My only complaint is that the guy putting toppings on was very stingy. Maybe they expect people to do tons of toppings, so they only do a little bit of each, but I only wanted a couple and had to ask for extras to cover the pizza evenly. I'll be back though."}
{"text":"We go here at least 3x a month! The selection is better than the rest of the places we've tried. We practically live in this place. We never leave unhappy. Thanks for the great service Lia & David (and ofc, the rest of the crew). Also, they added salads now which I can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, quick service. I ordered the zesty artichoke pizza I added pepperoni to it. My pizza was perfect! Very friendly staff and great customer service. I will be back. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed. I'm not usually too impressed with a lot of pizza places that are like everyone else's pizza. This stood out. I tweaked a vegan pizza and it was the best pizza I ever had. Since I just moved away from Chandler, and was just visiting, I'm now on the hunt for one here near Melbourne Florida. I hope for them that they are not too tucked away. Keep it up, and people will be seeking you out."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and close to the strip.  First time in a Pieology and it was well worth it. We would recommend to all"}
{"text":"Love the concept!! Great food for an outstanding price! Friendly staff... U can get a pizza for 7,99 and choose between different meats, cheeses, doughs, sauces without being charged!!! How can you not love that? :)"}
{"text":"First, be aware that this is not a sit down pizzeria; you walk up and order your pizza in stations similar to a buffet line. The pizza wasn't bad but didn't exactly blow me away either (think Dominos). Oh and they have no plates, I brought my kids and we had to use take out boxes as plates. Weird. Overall, sort of a disappointment but to be fair I expected (wanted) it to be something similar to Grimaldi's closer to my house."}
{"text":"A colleague & I stopped in to Pieology to grab lunch to-go, when we were done with work. First of all, the wait was horrendous. Not because they're overly busy but because there were only 3 people working & their methodology of working the line is not efficient (it's like the Chipotle/Subway of pizza). When my colleague went to place her order, one of the things she wanted to order was a bambino (children's) pizza for her kiddo. The kiddo was not with us so the woman would not let her order it! & she was stone cold & unapologetic about it. Nowhere on the menu did it say your 12-under child must be with you... for a takeout order! From there, the topping options were a hot mess- all mixed with each other & did not look fresh. To further slow things, the cashier was also tending to the pizzas in the oven & taking them out to box & hand them out. So that added about another 10min just for EACH of us to pay! We both tasted our food before leaving (sans bambino pizza) &, frankly, we both agreed that we would have preferred Dominos or Pizza Hut. I'm not sure where the average 4-stars comes from. I know we surely won't step foot in a Pieology again. Save your time & money."}
{"text":"Great pizza and a friendly staff. I'll definitely be going back. They had all different options for crusts and sauces which was pretty cool too."}
{"text":"First time in here and the staff were rather friendly. I've been to almost every create your own pizza kinda joints, and I have to say that this place probably has one of the best crust. It's a bit thicker then other places and more buttery. I wish they have a few more choices as far as veggies go, but all in all it was pretty tasty and the restaurant was clean which is a plus!"}
{"text":"When we moved away from Irvine, CA. I knew that Pieology was going to be one those restaurants that would be hardest to let go. Come to think about it, on my last trip back to CA, we made a special trip to Pieology (Irvine Spectrum location) just so that we can \"kustom\"-ise our own personal, magical, thin crust pizza.

When I found out that they were planning on opening a location that is literally less than 10 minutes from where I currently live, I was ecstatic! Now, mind you, they are a franchise and the consistency at this Vegas location is definitely lacking. First impressions: the space is a little larger than the Irvine, CA location, but the line moves at a snails pace! I was wondering what the hold-up is; I supposed the winning, efficient staff from CA weren't transferred over as well.

$7.95 for  a nicely sized thin-crust pizza with \"unlimited\" toppings is ideal. However, I was totally turned off when we got to the front of the line, the staff was meek, bored, scared and awfully stingy with the toppings - it was nearly a joke how much they actually coughed onto our pizza; a dot here and there of basil, a dot of ricotta, tiny teaspoon of garlic, 4 pepperonis... What in the world?! They absolutely skimp at this location. On the other hand, the Pieology in CA (the one that stole my heart) really, really hooked it up - they had no shame in their sexy topping game.

Here's the trick - in order to actually enjoy the wonderful thin crust pizzas here, I would recommend that you be firm and speak up if you want extra topping, they will look hesitant, but the amount they initially put on is such comedy. I will admit, the thin crust freshly prepared and baked crust is super legit. You really have to love thin crust in order to love this place. Also the subway style ordering is a nice touch, only when they aren't trying to be cheap with the toppings.  

On a scale of 1-10, ehhh, that's a tough call. It's different. Some people don't even call this pizza; they are offended by the idea. But we like it! It doesn't make us feel super food-coma'd afterwards and we always pressure them to give us more topping when they skimp. So that helps.

SUPER PRO TIP: the ranch is free and the pizza is dunkable."}
{"text":"Amazing! The pizza was delicious, its made fresh right in front of you. Only took a couple of minutes to get out pizza once it was in the oven (7 max). The price is super affordable, too. Perfect since we're doing Vegas on a budget. I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend isn't but we were allowed to do half and half for no additional charge. Staff was friendly. Definitely coming again. 

UPDATE 
We went back again before leaving Vegas because we started craving it. This time we got our own pizzas  Still as delicious and fresh as the first visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely cool especially because you get to build your own pizza with as much toppings for only $9! Ingredients are always fresh and pizzas always taste great no matter what you put on it. The only thing that makes coming here not so great is the service. This place gets busy and the staff seems very unorganized. They give us numbers for our orders to put on our table but they still come by with pizzas and ask if that's what we ordered. After a couple tries we got the right pizzas. If they really tried to stay organized with orders they would be even better."}
{"text":"I like how you can make your pizza the way you want with their various sauces and toppings at this restaurant. The high quality ingredients and servers and cooks are in front of you so you can see them prepare their food like at a subway or chipotle. 

My only concern is that it is a small corner location so sometimes they can get filled with not many places to sit during peak hours. The pizzas are baked in ten minutes time and come out hot."}
{"text":"If you were to ask me to make a choice of food you have to eat for the rest of your life, I would answer without hesitation PIZZA!  PIEOLOGY is definitely a worthy meal I could enjoy daily.   Similar to other Chipotle style BYO pizza places, for one price you can pile on the toppings. For $7.95 you can have as much or as little as you like.

BYO is simple or course.  Start with crust, then pick your sauces, cheeses, veggies and meats. They offer gluten free for an extra $2.  I liked the crust here it was not quite a circular shape giving it a rustic appeal and it was also thin and crispy.  

Today we went for the Easy Cheesy because that is what the kiddo would eat. However I will be back to attack a fully loaded pizza in the next week.  I can guarantee that."}
{"text":"This used to be Project Pie now it is Pieology.  It's pretty much the same thing good, cheap, fast eats in the MGM.  They are open until 1 am on Fri and Sat nights.  I was drunk and hungry after a concert and waiting for Lyft to drop below 250%.  It is basically the same as every other build your pizza place.  There was a short line that moved quick.  I got my usual pesto, pepperoni, olives, mushroom and garlic.  It was good, especially for $12 and on the strip.  Two people could split one."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. I was stuck waiting next-door for my sons haircut and was very hungry so I tried the barbecue chicken pizza and it was super crisp, quick, and delicious. I'll definitely  try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Had some pizza again just today and this place has never failed us! The pizza was perfect as usual, thin crust with the middle being perfected baked and not dry! I love that they always place a generous amount and the service was superb! For the price of this pizza you cannot go wrong! We were helped by a very nice man by the name of scout I think, he did an excellent job greeting and making sure we had everything we need, cracked a few jokes with my name Jenny and was very positive and happy! The place itself was very clean FYI"}
{"text":"Love Pieology!  So, happy they have one on this side of town!!    Guys behind the counter are very friendly.   Pizza was delivered to our table very quickly!!!   Must have the cinnamon and sugar pizza for dessert!!"}
{"text":"Tables are all dirty, food and crumbs all over chairs, napkins and trash on the floor.

Very appealing and appetizing!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today the restaurant was dirty every table in the dining room was dirty, where they build your pizza was a mess and there was no other customers in the place, no greeting when I walked in seem like the guy taking my order was irritated cuz he wanted his break the other employee was extremely rude. The manager girl came out and was doing all the work as the employee was texting on his phone with gloves on I will not be back to this place I'll stick with BLAZE"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I could eat their pizza all day. The service has always been friendly and attentive. I LOVE that you can design your own pizzas, and they taste absolutely amazing. Their cheesy bread is delicious as well. The restaurant is nice and clean. I really enjoy going here."}
{"text":"worst pizza i've ever had. 

came here believing this place to still be the same pizza joint i ate at last year. turns out back then it was called project pie and it was delicious. pieology must have bought out the location and now the pizza is awful. none of the ingredients have any flavor and they are far from generous with them. my custom pie had over 10 ingredients on it and it still tasted like cardboard. 

bring back project pie. pieology sucks."}
{"text":"Our first time coming, the lady showed us how it worked and helped us with our orders since it was our first time. Ever since then, we've been coming here more often. The only down side is they always forget to place it to go. Besides that, I like the place."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients.  This is a pizza Chipotle.  I made mine with mushrooms, basil, pineapples, ham on a regular crust. It came out pretty awesome"}
{"text":"Such good pizza!! Nice staff can't go wrong with the price either!  Highly recommend.  Kids loved it too and there picky!! Loved that they got to make there own pizzas!!!"}
{"text":"Once again I had another great pizza from Pieology. I tried the barbecue chicken pizza on the gluten free crust and it was amazing!! If you have not checked this place out you are missing an awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Went,in to try this place for the first time. Live not far and always looking for new pizza place. Walked into the unlocked doors at 1055am and was rudely informed they do not open until 11am. Now I completely understand if the kitchen is not ready, however as a newly opened enterprise that is still trying to lure new customers I would guess the owner would have liked their employee to welcome us and advise their customers the kitchen opens in about five minutes and we could take a seat for a few minutes while they got prepped. Lost my business for today and likely forever."}
{"text":"If Chipotle and pizza had a baby, Pieology would be the offspring.  This place in Downtown Summerlin offers an UNLIMITED amount of toppings in a create-your-own style thin-crust pizza.   For $8 this is a steal.  The pizza is a nice size and you will most likely have left-overs to bring home.

First, pick your sauce:  Options included the typical red sauce, 3-cheese alfredo, herb butter, olive oil, buffalo, pesto, and bbq.    I mixed some herb butter w/ the red sauce and it was delicious.

Next, it's time to pick your cheeses!  I added Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, and Ricotta.  Other choices include feta and parmesan.   The employees did not skimp on the cheeses and each bite of my pizza had unique flavors due to the cheese.  The Gorgonzola cheese may be strong for some (Think bleu cheese).   The ricotta has a light and fluffy texture, mildly sweet, highly delicious.

Finally, the toppings!  There are a plethora of toppings to choose from.  Meats I saw included pepperoni, meatball, italian sausage, bacon, chicken, spicy chicken, and ham.  There were a ton of vegetable options that you normally would add to a pizza but also included options such as corn, minced garlic, artichoke, basil, roasted red peppers, banana peppers, cilantro, mushrooms, etc.

My colorful creation had italian sausage, pepperoni, and meatball (which were more like crumbled meat) along w/ minced garlic, fresh cilantro, roasted red pepper and red onions.   Unlike other Yelpers' experience here, you could see from my photos that the staff did not get stingy on the toppings.  Woohoo.   The pizza is stuck in an oven and about a minute later you're enjoying some very delicious pizza. 

My 1 star deduction is for not being able to immediately find a clean table to sit at after ordering.  Every table as we walked around the generous sized location had crumbs, or empty red pepper packets on the table, or napkins/empty straw wrappers on the ground.  The other thing the restaurant could use is a larger sized menu.  They only have one posted menu the size of a travel brochure posted near the front and another one right when you order.  I could only imagine how much faster the whole process would be on busy nights if people in line could read from an oversized menu hanging above (think Chipotle) while they are waiting in line instead of having to decide once they get to the front of the line.  

All-in-all, a good place to stop by when in the Summerlin area.  Definitely, a pizza joint I'll return to if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Although my cooking specialty is scrambled eggs or a bowl of cereal, the thought of building my own pizza is extremely nerve wrecking to me. Somehow, somewhere I threw a whole bunch random ingredients on a pizza and it tasted like the best pizza I've ever had. Okay. I'm being dramatic. But this pizza was so on point. Almost better than fired pie."}
{"text":"They make the pizza in front of you and you chose what you want on it. I got the Alfredo pizza with pepperoni and pineapple. Pineapple does go on pizza and it's a great combination. If you don't want pizza they have salad."}
{"text":"Exceptional pizza and service! Highly recommend, first time here definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Since my daughter was born, I have been unable to eat dairy or soy because she is breastfed and allergic. We love going to Pieology because of the dairy- and soy-free options. It can be so difficult to eat out with food allergies, but going to Pieology is always a pleasant experience. Kali always recognizes us when we come in and makes sure that nothing dairy-related comes into contact with my food. Everything is made fresh and comes out delicious every time. Even my son, a very picky eater, enjoys coming here."}
{"text":"Best pizza! I love all of the fresh options and amazing, fast, friendly service! The staff takes the time to personalize your order from the crust, to the sauce, to the unlimited toppings. We got our pizzas delivered to our table within minutes and had several people check on us during our visit. This location has such a great environment. The walls are covered in positive quotes and the employees are positive and cheer each other on. I'll definitely be back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"What a cool place.  You get in line, tell the pizza people what you want on your pie and they pile it on, then into the oven it goes.  About 5 minutes later, your pizza is sitting in front of you.  All the pies are 12 inches (Pieology says 11.5 inches) and no matter how many toppings you want, it's a very affordable $7.95.  A plain cheese pizza is $6.95.  You get to build upon your choice of three crusts (\"house made\", whole wheat or gluten free).  Then pick your sauce:  red, herb butter, pesto, BBQ, spicy buffalo, and  a few others.  Or skip the sauce entirely and just paint your crust with olive oil!  Then you add your choice of about two dozen toppings and enjoy get ready for a treat.  If you're not in a creative mood, they have several recommendations you can pick from as well.

There are a few salad choices if you want some greenery, and a few desert options as well.

Give it a shot!  Tasty, fast and friendly!  Lots of parking too since this store is in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"I drove across town for this although they are also inside MGM Grand apparently.  All the glowing reviews were not wrong- the staff was helpful and friendly, the pizza was sooooo good (I never get to eat pizza and I'm from the east coast and love it) and I look forward to coming back.  So many choices and they were totally patient with me."}
{"text":"I have been to a few of these make your own pizza type of places and I have to say pielogy has the best crust/dough! Price was also very affordable as they do not charge per item you ass to your pizza! 
Will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, Dining room kept clean and will be coming back"}
{"text":"Just so so. A lot of toppings, but lackluster. Also, if you have allergies to dogs, be aware they let them in the place. Not service dogs, just little pocket pets. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I'm so happy one of these finally opened up close to my house! The staff here is super friendly and the restaurant looks clean plus the pizza is freaking delicious. Big fan"}
{"text":"I wish there was one of these closer to where I live! The pizza is delicious and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Weird..I usually have good experiences at this Pieology. However, today I went inside and there was no employees behind the counter (there were no customers either). I waited a few minutes and then one of the employees (who mind you was off work and just waiting for her ride in the lobby) asked me if I wanted her to go get somebody. Thankfully she went in the back and came out with someone to take my order. After sitting down to wait for my pizza I glanced over at the counter and saw a male employee come from the back and with his bare hands (no gloves) eat from the pepperoni container. Just gross."}
{"text":"The best build your own pizza I've had ever. The red sauce & herb butter tasted great. The toppings looked & tasted fresh. Great value for what I paid. We'll definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"The dish was savory and delicious. The restaurant was very clean and the workers were always working. Overall I give PIEOLOGY five stars! Great place for brunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Finally tried the new pieology! Very clean, sleek atmosphere with great service. 
I was a little overwhelmed , so I chose the BBQ chicken from the \"favorite\" section. Less than 5 minutes, my pie was ready piping hot in a easy to carry box. 
The pie was delicious! Great cheese and chicken flavor. This is almost too much for 1 person! 
I will def. be back to make my own creation. Wonderful and great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love pizzaaaaaaa 

But I was really disappointed in this place .... 

The workers were nice and super friendly though which was great :) 

I ordered the margarita pizza .....I tried one slice and was sad it had like NO SAUCE 

I might come back but I would have to tell them extra sauce because who wants a sauce free pizza that's lame"}
{"text":"First time at this location, lady that was making pizza had a little bit of an attitude and snapped when we asked a question, had a simple pizza cheese, garlic and spinach. But I asked for fresh green pepper on side she said okay and I get the pizza no green pepper barely any spinach . Never will come back to this location. Never have this problem at downtown summerlins location."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and really didn't know what to expect. Very open space with table and bench seating. We were greeted warmly and gave our order to a friendly young lady. She helped us with our selections and made the pizza. We ordered the thin crust with spicy chicken and bacon. Half with black olives. Olive oil with red sauce as a base and added some cilantro. They put the pizza in the fire and you go and get your drinks from the usual convenience store dispenser. Within about five minutes the friendly employee brought our pizza. Looked real good. She suggested Ranch Sauce to go with our spicy chicken. I'm not good with very spicy food. Great suggestion. The pizza was very, very good. The crust was cooked just right. It was nice and golden with a slight crunch. One of the best I've had. The pizza overall was very good and we'll be back. Talked to the manager who was friendly and told me about the \"history\" of Pieology. They are a national brand and have over one hundred and forty stores. Pretty aggressive growth since opening in 2010. They now have a thick crust, but again we had the thin. Would recommend and we'll be back. So much better than Pizza Hut, Dominos etc. I would put it up there with a very good pizza I had in St. Louis (yes, St. Louis) in the Italian place called The Hill. Nice job."}
{"text":"Agree with some of the other reviews that this place has a ton of potential but staff falls short. 
I came here when first opened and it was fantastic but went 3 days ago and since the new management took over its gone down hill.  Guy made 2 pizzas for me measuring a cup of cheese for the whole pie which only covered the center of the pizza.  I asked for extra cheese and was prepared to pay more however his response was \"im sorry this is the most I can give you,  Ill get in trouble with the manager if I give more\" really... your signs say unlimited topings but apparently that jist means I can have 10 different ones but not extra of any one even if I pay.  Additionally we left for home with our pies and opened them only to find the crust on each was badly burnt so it was gross.  Staff is dispassionate about customer service and cleaniness.  Sad because this used to be such a good place to eat"}
{"text":"Absolutly love the theme of this restaurant. Allows you to create and build your personal pizza to your liking. Staff all smiled, friendly and energetic. Order was ready in less than 5 minutes. Pizza was soft, hot and so delicious!!! Great location right near UNLV. Recommend it to anyone looking to get creative with their food. Definitely new favorite pizza spot!!"}
{"text":"I must admit that I was impressed with this place. I normally drive pass it when I'm shopping around within the plaza. I finally decided to stop in and give it a shot. They had specific specialty pizzas set at the same price of the customizable pizzas. Psst.....unlimited toppings when you make your own pizza! More for your money! Once you're done ordering, they check you out to pay your bill and hand you a number. There's plenty of clean seating areas within the restaurant even outdoor seating. I would also like to mention the fountain drink area has a bunch of options. They have unlimited refills for sodas, teas and lemonades. The quality of the food is delicious. Oh! If you check in on Yelp, you will receive a free fountain drink for your visit. Lastly, they offer military and first responders discounts! Winning! I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Wow...amazing idea.  Walked out $10 lighter after enjoying my own, custom-made pizza.  Service was quick and friendly.   What a great idea."}
{"text":"It was amazing. We had four different pizzas and all of them tasted 5 stars. Mike was extremely nice and friendly. Please come out to East Mesa."}
{"text":"I first heard of Pieology when I was in Fullerton, CA and am so happy to see them in Arizona now. This location is amazing and the staff is super friendly and very helpful. Everytime I come in, the shift leader, Joshua, always seems to be working and always goes above and beyond to make me and my friends experience the best. The pizza is amazing and I always love being able to throw whatever I want on my pizza at one price. While there are similar places sprouting up like this, Pieology is still the best!!"}
{"text":"Pielogy, how do I love you, let me count the ways...

This is the coolest idea ever invented, it's the Chipotle of the pizza world.  Get what you want, when you want it, how you want it coming from a brick oven and under twenty minutes.  

Magically delicious and i'm not talking lucky charms."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get pizza. The pizza is really good and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The pizza had a good flavor, but some of the other reviews hit the nail on the head.  Toppings were scarce.  I requested mushrooms, and when I saw how few she put on, I asked for more.  When I got the pizza, there were several slices without a single mushroom.  That's just one topping.  Pepperoni was the same, some slices had 2 pieces of nickel sized pepperoni.  Honestly, if \"Unlimited Toppings\" is going to be your tag line, live up to it! It seems like the employees were scared to death to give up the toppings!

I agree with the acoustics of the building. Everything echoes so loudly, it's hardly a relaxing atmosphere, and that was with just 5 customers in the building.  I can only imagine what it sounds like on a busy day.  

Hopefully there are just some opening jitters that will work themselves out.  I just recently discovered Fired Pie, and then when I saw Pieology, I was excited because it's closer to home.  I was disappointed with this first visit, so hopefully things turn around quickly.  If they won't go the extra mile, I will, straight to the competition."}
{"text":"Great customer service, unlimited toppings for one price, and delicious pizza. What more can you ask for? Definitely satisfied my pizza craving. Go try it."}
{"text":"Pretty good for pizza in a place that I have my favorite spots. What makes this place different is the cracker thin crust is amazing and the kids love to have a pizza bar where they can actually see the pizza being made and they get to pick exactly what they want on it."}
{"text":"The \"create your own pizza\" shop that has some of the best thin crust pizza I've ever had. Unlimited toppings with no extra charge and the service was fabulous!"}
{"text":"At first I wanted to try one of their pizza on the list of favorites. After approaching, one can not help but choose to customize in this subway style pizza shop. I opted for all the different types of cheese on my pie of red sauce with various veggies and meats. I might have overdone it with the toppings but it was still delicious. 
    The pizza isn't the best I've had but the concept is cool and the price is reasonable. I will be returning and trying different sauces and toppings."}
{"text":"We will definitely be back. Great crust, sauce and toppings. Excellent service and vibes from the staff  and in the restaurant overall."}
{"text":"I love this place you can put practically all the toppingd you want on the pizza for $7.99. The puzza is big enough to share gor two people. Or eat half of it and save it for later. The service is fast, and the pizza is brought out to you fresh. The staff are friendly and professional. The place is always clean."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Where else can you get anything you want on a pizza for $7.95? I'm waiting. ...exactly only here! The pizza's are huge enough to share with two people.  You can choose from the sauce and toppings. The wait for the pie isn't long at all.  The service was great as well!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing!!!!! Only thing as a negative that I can think of was the heat. OMG! The heat was on and way, way too hot!!!
Other than that, the pizza was great. Fresh ingredients. Hot pizza and the place was pretty clean. 
Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Pieology. I used to frequent Blaze Pizza across the way before I tried this place - Pieology is significantly cleaner, less busy, more vegetarian-friendly (veggies before meats on the line), has fresher ingredients, & happier/more accommodating employees. My order is never messed up, nothing has ever been forgotten. The price is comparable - the only thing that would have me coming back more would be more coupons (BOGO free, etc. like Blaze often does). No complaints though. My favorite place"}
{"text":"If you're looking for exceptional pizza at a low price this definitely is the place to go. For just $8 you can get a 12 inch pizza made just the way you want. Love the thin crust and array of sauce and topping choices. I've gone there several times already, I just can't seem to get enough. I go in the evenings and Sean, Justus and Zackese offer top notch service. The Pieology crew rocks and the food is even better."}
{"text":"I loved this place! One of the few delicious gluten free options in Vegas!! We ate there twice, thank you for one hell of a pizza."}
{"text":"Service was top notch. Friendly greeting at the door and offered to explain their process. Ordered pizza and salad. Added toppings to the caesar! Pizza crust was perfectly balanced between soft and crunchy. One drawback was the pepperoni was too small. Food overall tasted great. Another friendly greeting on the way out as well."}
{"text":"I like the full customization options. The staff is good. Restaurant is clean and nice. You can't really blame anyone but yourself if your pizza doesn't taste right! But all the bases (sauce, crust, toppings) are quality and tasty. IT's very thin crust pizza, and I normally have to get it cooked a little longer so that it doesn't fall apart."}
{"text":"I think we will stick with Blaze Fast Pizza from now on. They have 1 menu and if you don't know it's there you will miss it. The guy at the register must be mute because he did not say a word to us. Not when he delivers each pizza or when we both asked for ranch, Two separate occasions. There is 1 girl working hard to get the huge line down while both people who are wearing collared shirts are just hanging out. So sad. It must be acceptable to have such bad customer service since they are so close to UNLV, the strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center"}
{"text":"The staff is so fun and the pizza is amazing!!!! If I had the money, I would go broke here!!"}
{"text":"Love the Alfreo Alfredo with chicken added. The service is fast and friendly. 3 visits in 2 weeks about to make it 4 visits."}
{"text":"This place is the wrong place to go to if you get Hangry really easy. This place is typically always busy but when I walked in tonight it was alright. I tried calling 4 times and they never picked up so I could put in an order for to go. The pizza takes a really long time to bake so if you're hungry maybe try another place. It's just disappointing when you're trying to be in a rush and they can't accommodate you. Decent pizza but maybe just a once in a while type of place.  UPDATE: Gave an extra star bc I got my pizza and the workers are nice-ish."}
{"text":"The pizza is deff worth the money, I love that there is alot of flavor because of the butter based sauce they put on . And you can put ranch on top at the end as well. Would definitely go again for a lunch type of thing ."}
{"text":"Really nice and clean place and you can see the pizza made right in front of you. Think of it like Subway but the pizza version of it. You can select a pre-made pizza or create your own. If you do decide to create your own, you first select your type of crust which they have white crust, whole wheat, and Gluten-Free. Afterwards you choose your sauce, which they have the normal tomato sauce, Alfredo, herb butter, olive oil, fiery buffalo, pesto and finally BBQ. They have an assortment of meats and cheeses for you to choose from and best of all is that you can put however many toppings you want!"}
{"text":"Wow! Slow and incredibly rude customer service. I am not a person to post on Yelp unless I have something great to say about a place, however tonight's customer service takes the cake. There was only one person making pizzas and 2 other girls with her in the front turning pizzas in the oven and doing other things. Since there were about 3 or 4 people in line ahead of us we had to wait... understandable. When we finally got to the front 20! mins later the pizza maker didn't even acknowledge us and started making another pizza for God knows who. She finished and then came back and started making another one. As she was taking her sweet time I turned to my husband and said \"Wow! We have been waiting for 20 mins and they only have one person making pizzas when they have two other people right here in front of us.\" She heard me, finished making the second pizza, brought it to the oven, and started mumbling her frustrations with my comment to her co-worker. Then as she came back to take our order she grabbed the pizza pan and threw it down on the counter saying \"who's ready?\" I was shocked at how she slammed the pan down so I told my family \"Let's go.\" I was definitely not about to have a hostile person making my food. Then she said to the next customer in line \"Well... they're leaving... GOOD!\" I am shocked that an establishment would allow their employees to treat customers like that. It's appalling! My son said the worker's name was E.B. Don't go to this place especially when you can get The Habit or Panera Bread or Chipotle next door!"}
{"text":"Great place to create your own pizza! Superb experience I had lunch with my family and the staff Listen to everything my kid's had to say and created a delicious pizza.  As for me I coudent belive the options you have from meat's to veggies,  or if you wish they also have novelty pizza's. The location was clean and the staff friendly to top it off we got a free desert.  I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best place to eat for pizza. Has a similar layout to Chipotle in terms of restaurant design and ordering your pizza. You are able to freely create your pizza your way, no limitarions all for the same price. Surely spreading the word to everyone."}
{"text":"First timer here, when we entered the place it was clean and nice and open. Staff was very friendly. Pizza is to die for! Seriously the best pizza place in town and trust me, I'm always on the lookout for good pizza."}
{"text":"My pizza assembly line bar is set pretty high because of my excessive patronage of an incredibly attentive local MOD Pizza.  I was excited to give Pieology a try after hearing good things and being so poorly disappointed with Fired Pie.

Walked into a busy line, which was a good sign.  It was moving at a snails pace, but I was chatting with a co-worker in line so it was tolerable.  Get up to the veggies.  No broccoli left.  None in back.  Fine add some Basil.  No basil.  Five minutes later some found and added.

Asked for lots of chicken and they did so.  Bonus points here.  Spent another 5 minutes waiting for someone to come to the register to ring up the order.  

When the order came up only half of it arrived.  A pie was missing.  They finally located it.  The food tasted decent, but not amazing.  Overall the staff was friendly, but not really outgoing.

I will end up giving them another try.  Maybe they were just having a bad day.  Suggestions.  Get staff to have some enthusiasm and a little bit of giddy up in their step.  Keep trimmings stocked during peak times of the day.  People shouldn't have be leaving the line to go dig up bins."}
{"text":"I saw the sign for Pieology, the study of custom pizza and thought this place looked badA
Convinced my dad to eat here for lunch and the pies are amazing! (Pizza pies). So unique and you have so many choices of toppings, cheese, sauces and dough. Highly would recommend to any friend of a party of sorts."}
{"text":"So 5$ pizza Monday is now 5$ plus 1.99 for a drink. So for me the value of 5$ pizza Monday is gone. For me and my wife it used to be a little over 10$ for two pizzas. Now it is 15$ because you have to buy 2 drinks to get 2 5$ pizzas. When I pointed out the the pizzas are now effectively much more than 5$ dollars the shift leader argued with me until she realized that the advertised price and the effective price were different things. She was rude and obviously tired of people being caught off guard by the change at the register. The pizza here is good but the service has been lacking in some way everytime I visit. I am usually pretty cool about things like toppings being put on my pizza I didn't ask for. (happened twice) I was dissapointed at the change in the promotion and the service from the shift leader however. (I guess if paying 2$ for a drink is your thing then this is still a decent deal.)"}
{"text":"dont come to this specific location @ summerlin if u planning to avail of any promo/coupon..... they will not honor it....
as mention with other reviews.. they make all excuses.... they even said it was sent by error.... how can it be an error.. if the promo was on their website... but if ur willing to pay full price...  this is ur place... but overall.. pielogy is great... except this franchise..."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, gentle service and quick...perfect for a quick Pizza near MGM Grand
By the way the store is located downstairs, level -1 I guess"}
{"text":"We have frequented many restaurants including top chefs like London in NYC , Gordon Ramseys & Emerill, Bobby Flat and I must say we had a wonderful experience in your establishment. THE BEST was the most professional, cordial , helpful  & patient attitude of your terrific manager, Jay. He should be acknowledged as a great asset to your company. My deaf SON ,who looks like a teen is 30 yrs old and usually not treated with the patience & respect he received from Jay. The whole staff was friendly & pleasant. THANK U FOR A GREAT EXPERIENCE. THE FOOD IS FRESH & FUN AS WELL."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here tonight for the first time and it was sooo amazing. Unlimited toppings?! Yes please! Your manager Jose was absolutely amazing. He helped us make some of our choices, and told us which things he's tried. Jose has amazing customer service skills. He was very helpful and makes a mean pie. The kind of pie you don't share because its yummy. Jose also hooked is up some free drinks...what a good guy and a hard worker!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Great value. Positive atmosphere. Any and all the toppings you want for one price. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Truly love this place. It's like a Togo's or Subway but for Pizza. For under 10 bucks you get a 12 inch pie, you get to put how many ingredients you want and they do it right in front of you.  Nice fresh ingredients, and it tastes amazing, you are in and out fairly quickly. Definately recommend this place to all pizza lovers out there."}
{"text":"Normally one of my favorite pizza spots, but on my last few trips to this particular location it has been not as good! Either the staff seems in too much of a hurry, not very personable, and inexperienced. What I generally like is the fact that my pizza gets all the toppings I want and good dispersement of toppings, but the last few times it seems like i'm at Subway(4 of this, 4 of that). If I order pepperoni, I like most people would like a bite of pepperoni in each bite, not have to hunt for it on my pie! 
Dirty dining room! Hope things change next time or it's on to a new pizza spot!"}
{"text":"Sooooo pizza is pretty much my favorite thing ever.  I don't know why I didn't try this place sooner because it's a great little quick stop when you're craving a pie.  I really do love all types of pizza and perhaps I was afraid the 'non-authenticity' of a subway style pizzeria would disappoint me.  Well me and the fam tried it out the other night and were pleasantly surprised with our visit.  We ordered a 'nice to meat you' and a buffalo chicken pizza, along with a Caesar salad.  First off, it's a cute little place for a 'fast' food joint...the staff was SO friendly and helpful.  It's a great value at $7.95 a pie and honestly it was really good!  Caesar dressing was a bit on the mustard tasting side but still good with chunks of fresh Parmesan.  Both pizzas were very good.  The buffalo chicken is SPICY, and I like spicy.  Love the hint of Gorgonzola.  The meat pizza was very much enjoyed by my littles.
Nice find!  Will return."}
{"text":"Okay the pizza is great! The only problem is they do occasionally run out of a lot of the topping and sometime the dough... the device is great, and they always load on the toppings!(if they don't just ask, it's no extra charge!)

The pie rise dough is a must get! As well as the herb butter! So amazing! Me and my boyfriend love this place we love that we can both get sized pizzas for both of us for $20. We love to eat out but don't like breaking the wallet."}
{"text":"We knew with the first bite that this was our new favorite place for pizza. Mike and the team have been undoubtedly some of the best people when it comes to customer service. It's always fun, and my whole family loves it!! We'll be here ALL the time."}
{"text":"I'm a real fan of this place. I like the whole idea of building your own pizza Subway-style, except the difference is that it tastes 100x better than Subway. The ingredients they use are fresh and unlike Subway they aren't stingy with the cheese or meats ;) The pizzas themselves are pretty small at around 11-12in I want to say. It's probably not enough to share with 2 people but it's definitely good enough for one adult.

They have a number of different toppings for both meats and veggies. Once you pick your toppings they throw it in the oven which usually cooks the pizza in less than 10 minutes. I love how FRESH and thin crust the pizzas come out and being a pizza snob myself I'd say the quality of pizza here is pretty good.

The only knock I give this place is that because they create your pizza on the spot, the lines can get pretty long and move slow. I see a lot of complaints about the slow service but every time I've gone, there has been barely any line.

For a fully customizable pizza for $10 ready in 10 minutes or less, I love this joint!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The price is very reasonable 4 9 slices of pizza.. Fresh unlimited toppings cooked in 5 minutes! They arent skimpy with the toppings either! This place will be my go 2 4 pizza from now own! The ppl at this location were fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Pieology is bomb. as fresh as it gets. Has the chipotle /subway method where you order down the line. Then they pop your pizza in the oven to cook, takes 10mins. Definitely worth the wait. Thin crust pizza"}
{"text":"Great place! Absolutely amazing service derrik did an exceptional job and answered all my questions and kept a smile on his face the whole time. My new favorite place!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. So many options at such a good price. The reason for 4 stars is that I have to ask for extra everything."}
{"text":"This pizza is really tastyNot as many topping options as pizza rev or blaze, but Pieology wins for best crust... Yum eee. I will be back"}
{"text":"Perfect for this area we needed something new. Fresh ingredients, courteous staff, great prices."}
{"text":"Just looking for a quick Healthy lunch and was surprised to find This place.  They have The Best Gluten free Pizza!!! And many toppings without extra cost. Their salad was dress I'm hooked!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good. The service is terrible. I ordered online. The website said it would be ready in 20 mins. I got there at the 15 minute mark, and then proceeded to wait another 40 minutes. That was a really fun time. The place is also obnoxiously loud and filled with kids. Don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Fun!  Everyone can make their own pizza for $7.95. Unlimited toppings. Pick your own sauce and oils.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I was sooo excited to try this place and was extremely happy when they had a easy way to order online (the only reason for one star). So after ordering online we go to pick up our two pizzas cheese bread and churro pizza. It was busy, hectic and the employees were extremely rude. I get it your busy and overwhelmed but you work in the hospitality industry. At least try to act like you like your job that you are getting paid for. They hand us one pizza and a bread and we asked where the gf pizza was, they got an attitude and said oh that was yours? (It wasn't even in the oven yet and shouldn't they a check order with each item ordered??). So after a 15 minute wait and a lot of passive aggressive rude interactions with the employees we got the pizza and left with out realizing we were still missing an item from our order. By the time we got our hangry children reminded us of the mistake. We called in and the \"manager\" told us they forget to put it in the oven..... a little more passive aggressive rude \"oh sweetie\"s thrown in and she said well you can come back and get it or we can add it to your next order.... like thanks.... for adding an item that we already paid for to our next order... 

So we drove back out to pick up the rest of our order, they ended up giving us a free cheese bread.... but still left a bad taste in our mouth for the whole place. If the employees were nice from the beginning and tried to be accommodating for their mistake (I understand things happen but it's all in how you handle the situation) it wouldn't of been such an ordeal."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at Pieology and I am very impressed. The workers were very friendly and my pizza was delicious! I have been to Mod pizza and have always enjoyed it, but there is something about the dough and sauce at Pieology that makes it my new fave over Mod pizza. I also liked the decor, I love reading all of the positive messages on the boards. My only criticism is that I love tart lemonade and theirs was a bit sweet. I look forward to trying their other flavors, hopefully there will be a tart one in the bunch. :)"}
{"text":"Literally just came home from Pieology my husband and I both got a pizza. His is cooked perfectly mine is burnt. When they showed my pizza I didn't think to look at the bottom. 
When the pizza was being made the area was dirty different toppings mixed together. They aren't clean at all. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've come here before and multiple locations and had no problems. Everyone today had there pizzas burnt or getting the wrong ones."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza.... Dare I say it.  Maybe even better then MODS PIZZA.
This location has poor customer service and I'm actually only talking about Management.  I waited an hour to order ... no biggie trust me the pizza was very good.  I tried to use the yelp coupon and the management wanted to touch my phone to make sure the coupon was redeemed  hey back up buddy, I can hit redeem.  Don't touch my property! ( I was about to do the crane karate kid reference ).  Let's be adults about this for one minute.  If you want to ask to see it.. you can ask but don't touch my phone  

Long story short she wouldn't honor the coupon... Don't worry PIEOLOGY  I still bought a drink
This is the l I visit this location"}
{"text":"I went the downtown Summerlin location today. They advertised via email from the Pieology club, and on Facebook, that they would be serving $3.14 pizzas today for pie day 3/14. They would not honor the email or the post to Facebook promotion stating that that was a corporate decision and they are not honoring it. It is completely against the law to put advertisements out there and not honor them. It's also a form of bait and switch advertising which is also illegal. I told the manager of the store this same thing today and he still stated that they would not honor it. 
I will never return to this location again. I am contacting corporate regarding the manager.

I added a photo of the Facebook post to the photos. I don't know how to add it to my actual post."}
{"text":"Best little fast-casual pizzeria is the west! Thank you for the quick and friendly service. Jay was amazing."}
{"text":"To be honest it's nothing better than to be able to order and eat good food in less than 10 minutes. You can say I'm something like a fast food junkie...but don't think for a second that your typical fast food places compare to Pieolgy! Although it's fast it is so fresh! One of my daughters favorite food is pizza, mine is salad and we can get both just the way we like!!! It's ridiculous how inexpensive yet filling our personal dishes are...i love it! Check out my photos and see just how amazing the food looks..it tastes even better!!"}
{"text":"Soft opening, great food, going to be a daily food stop for sure! Great food awesome environment! Upbeat staff! Gotta try the Alfredo's Alfredo!"}
{"text":"Talk about a very welcome addition to the neighborhood! 

For a quick serve pizza this is truly as good as it gets.  Great crust, fresh ingredients, excellent red sauce.  Portion size should be ideal for most people. 

The price is really reasonable for the high quality of the pizza.  

I'll be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Really friendly service and great pizza. I alternate between blaze and this place. The plus here is the wheat base. And the buffalo chicken pieces."}
{"text":"Great value for money.
Excellent pizza!
Enjoyed the Spicy Italian, Artichoke & also the Buffalo Chicken."}
{"text":"Good pizza and nice selection of toppings. Healthy choices too!  A shout out to Joe for good service!"}
{"text":"Had a Buffalo chicken pizza and it was ok and I've had better. Price a little high for such a small pizza."}
{"text":"Great, food, location, and service. Love this place!! Been coming for a while now. Probably once a week! It's that good!!"}
{"text":"We checked in at MGM at around 11 and I stumbled upon this place.  I quickly learned that Project Pie is a part of Pieology as some of the staff members were wearing Pieology shirts also their boxes has the logo on them.  The rundown is pretty much the same, but they have better ingredients like prosciutto, brussel sprouts, and garlic butter/olive oil.

I'm pretty terrible at choosing toppings that go well with each other but my concoction turned out pretty good.  The caramelized onions and pineapple perfectly countered the saltiness from the prosciutto and bitterness of the brussel sprouts.  The crust was really thin but I was hoping it would have been crispier.  I also wish that they used fresh pineapples instead of canned.

For $12 it's a good deal and they're open until 1 on the weekends."}
{"text":"I like the idea of this place alot. I wish you could request for how crispy you would want your slice though. Every time I come here, they over cook mine to like a cracker consistency. The toppings are good too but none really stand out in a memorable way. If they improved in these two ways I would frequent this place much more."}
{"text":"Gluten free, thick crust, crunchy. They have it all! Unlimited toppings for $8.99. Great place, food and service. Have some patience as they just opened last week. Working out the kinks still."}
{"text":"Just went for dinner and we loved it! I had the alfredo pizza with pesto chicken and bacon added and my husband had the BBQ pizza with bacon added and both were great! We also tried the cinnamon chocolate churro pizza which was also super good! The staff was super friendly and checked up on us to see how everything was and if they could get us anything. We had to get to-go boxes because the portions are big! I would definitely come here again and recommend it to friends. We have been to MOD pizza and I would say it's very comparable but this is closer to us! Restraint is very clean and good seating for big groups and families."}
{"text":"Hayden was super funny, helpful and had great attitude ! Love the build your own pizza ! AND BOMB LEMONADE !!!"}
{"text":"The Chipotle of Pizza 

I went to Pieology for dinner last night with my sister and nephew and I have to admit we really enjoyed our meals.  Pieology has the same concept which is similar to Chipotle.  You create your very own pizza masterpiece.

Pieology, has an assembly line concept for Pizza or salad if you  prefer.  You walk up to the counter and walk down the line.  As you walk down the line you tell the Pizza cooks what to add to your pizza.  The price remains the same reguardless of what or how many topping  you add to your pizza.

I ordered a pie with tomato sauce, ricotta, mozzarella, roasted peppers, pepperoni and spicy sausage.  My sister and nephew  ordered similar but with a couple of topping changes. 

The line moved very quickly so we built or pizza creations, paid, and filled our drinks.  The pizzas came about seven minutes after that.  Pieology offers a good selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and vegetables.  Prices are modest, I had a standard 11 inch pie and a fountain drink for about ten dollars.

The staff is friendly, accomadating, 
the food is good, and at a reasonable price. 

If your in the area give it a try."}
{"text":"I would for sure come back here. Came here this past week for the first time with a friend & was extremely impressed. We were greeted by a nice guy when we walked in, and we were told to choose any of the toppings we wanted on our pizza... It's basically a chipotle, solely for pizzas. I got the garlic/herb butter spread on the crust of my pizza, marinara sauce for the base, Parmesan/mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, meatball, sausage and garlic. It was such a good combination. I can't wait to rant and rave to my friends about this place. I believe it was only $7.95 as well. Cheap & awesome!"}
{"text":"Segunda vez que vengo a este lugar excelente buen precio limpio la pizza rica los empleados amigables pero todavía estoy esperando en la cerveza  hace mucho lo tienen \"coming soon\""}
{"text":"Food handling practices are horrible. Meat, veggie and cheese handled with same gloves. Horrible.

Told the manager, acted surprised, really? She wanted to give me a free pizza. 

If you are allergic or have a religious preference about certain meats....no worries- they handle everything with same gloves. Yuck!"}
{"text":"This is my first time having Pieology off the strip. My pizza was a bit over cooked. I had the thicker crust, I now prefer the original one. I had all of the meats with the exception of chicken with basil, onions, banana peppers, cilantro....Next time I won't get the basil nor cilantro, not that it was bad, just not the taste I was going for. Can't beat a personal made pizza for 7.99. Will return..."}
{"text":"Really great variety of toppings. I had to get the gluten free crust because their traditional crusts are not vegan. It wasn't my favorite but the toppings & daiya cheese made up for it. Also, the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"I must say, I liked the pizza but the atmosphere was horrible. I sat in for a late lunch with my sister and the music was very loud. We could barely hear each other. I would not take children in there because most of the music had curse words and used the N word a lot. I will not go back to this place. I would have given it a one star but like I said I liked the pizza."}
{"text":"The experience I had at Pieology was amazing the staff was very friendly the place was clean and the Food was incredible tasted so fresh I had the thick crust that's what the girl recommended and it was awesome and it's nice and cold in there good to get out of the heat definitely somewhere that I am going to return"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, and different. I would recommend if u wanna try something new and adventurous making your pizza. Ingredients are pretty standard and service is ok."}
{"text":"Freaking YUM.  Super awesome range of toppings, sauce and cheeses to pick from!  All really fresh and delicious.  I don't live in this area but if I did, I'd be a regular here!  I am allergic to tomatoes, which is tragic for a pizza lover like myself, but this place has multiple sauces to substitute for red sauce which is awesome. I got the cheese sauce which was delicious. Oh and the crust is yummy!  It's perfectly crunchy."}
{"text":"Loved the Chipotle style pizza mods. Thin crusts are my favorite. So a big plus here. I chose the wheat base, with pesto sauce, chicken, bacon, pineapple, olives and onions. Pizza was out in 5 minutes. All for approximately 8 bucks.
Thoroughly impressed with the place. Will be back."}
{"text":"The pizza is always thin crust, it's baked in front of you and you get to choose your toppings for a decent price . Not bad! The line is never too long and the inside decorations are nice and simple. I like coming here and would definitely return."}
{"text":"We wandered in to the store tonight after shoe shopping for hours at the mall. I needed something filling before heading out for the night. The guys behind the counter were entertaining and engaging. Gus has great taste in jeans and fired our pie like a pro. Mike was the comedian of the bunch, and knows a prolific tattoo artist. They made some great suggestions, then cut us loose to build or own pie and salad. Portion size was great, and the crust was thin and crispy, like I asked for. I LOVE the concept and will return here to try other combinations. Value for the price was excellent, and the variety and freshness of the toppings was
Impressive. Thanks, Pieology, for a memorable first visit!!"}
{"text":"omg!!! what a great experience wonderful atmosphere and great delicious pizza...shot out to..jeorudin, corey, david and courtney!!! u all rock...my family and i will be back really soon!! thxs u much!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise. Next to Panda Express. 

Great vibe upon entering. Motivational quotes on the wall in an eye catching style from many sources past and present. 

Straight forward ordering (counter service)- pick your crust: original thin, upgrade thick +$1, gluten free+$2, or whole wheat 
Pick your base- red sauce, pesto, olive oil, garlic something (I picked it, def recommend!)
Cheese- mozzarella, feta, Parmesan, ricotta , maybe another 
Lots of fresh veggies to choose from 
Meats- Regular chicken, spicy chicken, pepperoni, meatball, bacon, Canadian bacon, sausage 
After bake drizzle- pesto, red, or ??


I had:
original (thin) crust
pesto and garlic base
Mozzarella and feta cheese 
(Fresh) Mushroom, onion, spinach 
(Cooked) regular Chicken, meatball, Canadian bacon 

My pizza was cooked just right. All toppings heated evenly, melty cheese, crispy crust. Loved it. Next time I think I would try bacon instead of Canadian bacon, but all in all, a 4.5/5. 

Other choices were a few salads, Caesar, house, unsure of custom salad option, and a couple of desserts- chocolate chip churro pizza stood out, but I remain curious for now. 

Bottled beverage choices and Fountain beverages and gold peak tea- including peach and an unsweetened option. 

Staff was smiling and worked well together. Everyone had a great attitude. While the speed of service was a little meticulous, it reflected well in the quality assurance. 

I have tried the competitor across the street and was underwhelmed overall.
Very happy to have this new pizza location! Really hit the spot for me! I look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"I finally went to see what all the good buzz was about and I loved everything about it. The service and pizza was great! If you LOVE pizza and want great service in a friendly environment, you should definitely try it out! 
 
Say \"Hi\" to Jose while your in there! 

This is definitely a new favorite spot for me and my family!!"}
{"text":"Okay, this gets 3 stars because they carry gluten free pizza. Now, the Blaze pizza just across the street gets 5 stars for having gluten free and its fresh, not frozen. Pieology only has frozen gf pizza and its shipped from a company. They don't even make it there. I feel that this is a total after thought with them offering gf pizza. The other thing was, i thought my pizza lacked flavor.
Im not impressed and won't be back. For the same price, i can go across the street for a fresh gf pizza for the same price."}
{"text":"Delicious! That about sums it up. I went with four different made to order pizzas just to try as many as I could. I did not find one that I didn't like"}
{"text":"Great service great food fun people. Get extra napkins and a bib.  We had 7 people and the line went fast. The topping were many and the food tasty.  There was a large well lite seating area too!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last week and it is AMAZING. I didn't believe my friends when they told me this was the best pizza in Vegas but I was wrong. I had the alfredo pizza with ham and I was in heaven. I also had the breadsticks and they were also amazing. My boyfriend eats here at least once a week and is obsessed with it! I will definitely be back to this location! It's very clean and the employees are really nice and efficient!"}
{"text":"I love a place that lets you choose pizza toppings and how much of each you want on your pizza. The price is reasonable at $7.95 for an 11.5\" pie. The crust is super thin so it's good if you watch carbs. My only complaint would be the blackened crust. I would have preferred it less well-done. And I would advise patrons to specify how much of each topping you want. They seem willing to accommodate you--if you ask. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is no Project Pie.

As a former MGM Grand employee, my experience with made to order pizza places was Project Pie. That place set the bar for personal pizzas for me. 

Anyways...I went for a pizza that I thought I'd be familiar with--Smokin Buffalo Chicken and I added mushrooms, tomatoes, and basil to it. I was given a number and told that they would bring the pizza to me when done. So I find a seat after getting my cup of water and wait for my food to come. In a bout 15 minutes, my pizza came and I was a little excited for it. (I had heard all the craze about the chain and related it to my experience at Project Pie). 

First disappointment: my pizza wasn't sliced! Do they not slice your pizza and just expect you to pick it up and eat it like a cookie?? I looked around at others dining in, and noticed they were eating with a knife and fork! I immediately thought, \"Seriously?!\" So I get my fork and knife and try to cut my pizza into edible pieces....

Second disappointment: the crust was so tough to cut through and the bottom was at a burnt crisp. I had to practically saw my way through the pizza to eat it! If I wasn't as hungry as I was and I could waste food, I would have upped and left!

I guess I'm spoiled by great service and food. The Chipotles and Project Pies have set the standard for quality food and customer service. I would never have gotten a burnt pizza nor would I have been expected to slice my own pizza with a plastic fork and knife at Project Pie. I'm hoping that in time, this location will live up to the standards of the chain as a whole."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. They have really good quality toppings and I love that it's as much as you want. They also have a thicker crust option if you don't like your pie too thin. The service is alright. The employees here are young kids so it makes sense that they don't really care. You can also make your pizza half and half if you want to try something different or share."}
{"text":"There are many similar concepts out there now and Pieology is one of them. They do a great jog and I really like the dough that they use. When I come here I always go for the Pesto Basil sauce for my pizza. Then I get all of these fantastic vegetable options that they offer and top it off with grilled chicken. They are located across the street from Blaze (same concept) but I prefer their crust.

The only thing I would change is the tea here. I don't like my tea coming from a concentrate out of a dispenser. It is not soda for gosh sake! Other than that, the place is really clean and Twyla and I love all of the motivational sayings on the walls.

This place is surrounded by other restaurants and shopping. There are many other strip malls close by that house many points of interest. This is a newly exploding area with a lot of new builds and entertainment. In the not to distant future, this area might become a destination point. However, if you are craving some good pie, come out and support the local businesses.

{"text":"This was really fun - and very tasty!

The \"pizza maitre d'\" as I call her was patient, helpful, and very pleasant. 

I had her put a garlic basil sauce on the crust, and then extra pesto sauce, then loads of tomatoes, grape tomatoes, onions, bell pepper, dried red pepper and artichoke hearts, along with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 

They needed a forklift to lift it all.

Well, OK, maybe that part is embellished. Actually I was surprised how big the pizza was. It was fun seeing the woman take the dough as \"squash\" it into the circular crust and watch this whole \"pie\" evolve into delightful dining!

They also offered four extra sauces - pesto, hot sauce, barbeque and ranch.

Then there's Parmesan, hot peppers, salt, pepper and oregano shakers by the well-stocked Coca-Cola and tea beverage area.

The whole experience was fun, and very yum. I heartily recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza person, but every now and then a great food experience changes my mind.  Well tonight I had that experience at Pieology.  

The concept is: you start off with a 12\" gluten free dough, you then choose your unlimited amounts of toppings. You start with the amazing sauces.  Choices are marinara, olive oil, garlic pesto and I might have forgotten one.  Next is your choices of cheese.  You get to choose from gorgonzola, ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan and I think I might have missed one. Next is the vegetables, way too many to list.  Last but not least is the abundance of meat toppings.  Did I say unlimited yet!!! 

Pizza goes into a hot pizza oven and cooks for 4-5 minutes.  Pizza is then delivered to your table.

You get all this for $7.99.  I don't think this price will stay this way for long, so hurry up and get your pizza now!!"}
{"text":"It's like the chipotle of pizza. Delicious and cheap. Fresh ingredients good staff. Only for people who prefer their crust on the thinner side. I suggest pineapple with sausage :))"}
{"text":"Meh-? The concept is good, but the couple pizzas we tried were just okay. Not to say I won't be back, but it would be nice if they had more creative starter pizzas and then add to that."}
{"text":"I did not know you could make pizza any better but apparently at Pieology you can. 

When you first enter you encounter that familiar feeling as one would when entering a Chipotle or Subway which is pretty much what this pizzeria's formula is all about. Go up to the counter and start loading your pizza up with all the Free, yes I said FREE, toppings your heart could desire. So pretty much go Ham, ha get it, so you can get bang for your buck.

The service is outstanding as well the couple of times that I have gone. The workers help you build the best tasting pizza and can recommend what ingredients go with what. Just a heads up they do have a wheat dough option as well for you somewhat healthy people out there.

The best thing is you get your pizza baked in a giant oven and in as little as 5 minutes depending on the amount of people there are, you get your delicious, pretty much homemade, pizza hot out of the oven which is pretty much perfection, all for under $10. You can't really beat that. 

One pizza is good enough to fill an average person up pretty well depending on how many toppings you put on there. This is a personal pizza so keep that in mind. It's about 12 inches across which is just the right size for me. The best thing is, no one can really complain about how their pizza turns out as the people are the ones building it. My pizza always has super gooey cheese that strings as you pull the pizza apart. Seriously such a good experience.

I highly suggest everyone to at least try this place out once in their life. This place will certainly get you hooked."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Even though it was busy, it did not take long at all. Tell them what to want on your  pizza & enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza make by your self here so good. I know have a lot pizza restaurant like this but I love to eat here Coz BBQ sauce so good that why. Also they're cooking faster that good when your hungry Lol."}
{"text":"This Pizza place is a new addition to the dining choices at Downtown Summerlin. They offer indoor and patio seating. The concept is a pizza with unlimited toppings for one price The pizza order is processed by four people operating as a progressive line. The first person is prepping the doe which is formed by machine. The next person applies the choice of sauce and cheese. A third person add the choices of vegetables and meats. The last person collects the payment and provides a cup for your choice of self serve refreshments. Cooking time is five minutes and the finished pie is delivered to your table. A very efficient operation. 

We were in line at lunch time and 15 people were ahead of me and when I reached the cash register the line behind was the same length. The wait time was longer than the pizza build and cook time. 
This week day the place was filled with teens and  families. The eating area was very loud and conversation challenged. 

We ordered two types of pizzas and both were delicious. The pie had a crispy thin crust and the toppings were tasty. 
Pieology works a s nice place to stop after the theater or shopping for some very good pizza at an inexpensive price point."}
{"text":"Wanted to love it.. well it feels like a plagiarism of Mod Pizza .. problem is when you copy something it should be better.. this place was not.. pizza was slimy and the crust had no flavor.. skip it go to Mod .. the staff was fine and friendly and the toppings seemed fresh enough just overall not great.."}
{"text":"For some reason, my husband really likes this place. So today, he asked me if I could pick up some pies for him while I was out. It's out of the way so I figured ordering online would be better, thinking I could just run in, grab my order and keep it moving...WRONG! I placed my online order at 5:33 and got my email confirming at 5:34. When ordering, it asked if I wanted my order \"ASAP\" which showed 20 minutes or if I wanted a specific time. I selected 6pm. I had my 2 little ones with me, so I was already dreading getting them out while I picked up but figured it should be quick since I've already ordered. I got there at 6:03. There was a line so I was glad I'd ordered ahead. I went to the counter and informed the girl I had an online order. She asked someone and told me it wasn't ready yet. I asked why not? I requested a pick up time so I wasn't understanding why my ordered hadn't even been cooked yet! Then some guy, I'm assuming was the manager, comes over and says the order just printed and something about how 2 other orders printed late too. I'm calling straight BS. They were busy and somebody missed the order. But IF the online orders are printing late and they're aware of it, they need to 1: get out fixed, cause obviously it's a problem and 2: have someone periodically checking for online orders. I would've had more respect if he just told me sorry, we were slammed and overlooked it. That, I could understand. So now I wait an additional 17 minutes, with my 1 and 3 yr olds, because somebody missed my online order. Another customer saw me waiting and asked if I'd ordered online. I told her yes and she said that's what she's afraid of, ordering online and then it still not being ready. I won't be driving all the way to pieology again to wait for an order AND get soggy pizza."}
{"text":"Took my niece Heather to Pieology for the first time.  We received excellent customer service from Colin.  The food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Getting food at Pieology is always a welcome delight. I'm not huge on the make-your-own pizza concept, but as far as it goes, the chandler and 101 pieology does well.  I always feel like I get a well-sized portion and the \"pizza-crafters\" are excellent at advising my creations and preventing potential flavor combination doomsdays. The real thing of note however, is the people. Joshua (the manager, I think) and Collin served as a reminder tonight as to why i keep returning to pieology. Colin is always chipper, making me feel like a friend as he makes my food, and Joshua makes sure I'm having a great experience and checks in at my table to make sure everything is perfect. As said, make-your-own-pizza is so-so to me, so I guess you could say the people are what make this place great. Regarding environment, the place has a welcome wide-open feel and is super clean. Great quality food and positive people make chandler pieology a great place to study excellent food service."}
{"text":"Instantly greeted when we walked in.  Can't beat $8 for unlimited toppings. Mike was great...came on checked on us to see if we needed anything. All the staff were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ordering pizza the same way to order a sub, who would have thought it would work so amazing! The toppings all fresh, made the way YOU want it! This place is awesome, the staff is nice, it's clean, and most important of all it's delicious! I could eat here everyday if I could. Love all the different combinations you can make. Brought a friend from out of town and they absolutely loved it! Definitely a place to bring other out of town guests!"}
{"text":"I stopped in at Pieology at MGM and had the Fire Grilled BBQ Chicken Pizza. The pizza was crisp and the topping were great best wood fired pizza I believe I have ever had. The atmosphere is great for the location and offers a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of Vegas and MGM."}
{"text":"3 stars for the 25 min wait prior to even placing the order. This place has potential, but they need better staff."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this is my FAVORITE pizza place. My boyfriend and I stopped in today and got 2 pizzas which were both outstanding. I got the thick crust (something I've never seen at similar concepts) with your basic house red sauce, mozz, salami and tomatoes. The crust was INCREDIBLE. It was the perfect amount of fluffiness and crispness. The pizza also came out within 4 minutes! My boyfriend got the traditional crust  with Alfredo, spinach, and mushrooms. The Alfredo had the perfect flavor and it was very cheesy!  We got 2 pizzas and a lemonade for only $21 dollars. Not to mention, they have some really good lemonades as well. We got the watermelon mint lemonade--amazing. 

We will definitely come back next time the pizza cravings kick in!"}
{"text":"We wanted a yummy lunch...not fast food...but quick. We decided to stop here for pizza. We got the BBQ chicken and then we made one that was soooo good!! Alfredo sauce with chicken, canadian bacon, artichokes, mushrooms, and just a couple banana peppers with mozzerella and feta cheese. After is was baked we had it drizzled in pesto. SO GOOD!!! The original crust is just awesome. We fed 2 adults, an 11 year old and 4 year old on 2 pizzas. Service was prompt and I think the prices are really decent for this type of place."}
{"text":"If you like pizza crust or sauce, skip this place. Wafer thin flat bread type crust. Sauce is finely applied with a kitchen brush. Fast food pizza at best. It was fast or it would be a one star. I asked for more cheese and the prep guy brought it back to the cheese area but did not add more and carried it to the oven."}
{"text":"For Gluten-free and Vegan cheese, this place is the best I've had. My Hubs got regular crust and cheese and also really like it. So glad they came in to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for this place! Inside MGM grand hotel in the \"Underground\" area to the right of the Check-In area. $12 for a 12\" VEGAN pizza! They have Daiya here and the olive oil and red sauce is vegan! I added all the veggies (they were out of mushrooms ). They didn't have any vegan meat subs which is fine, but would be cool if they had some vegan sausage or somethin. But I'm not complaining, I was so happy to find an easy vegan option IN my hotel! And the staff were so nice! Also they close kinda early (10pm on a Wed) so get ur pizza to-go!"}
{"text":"What a fun place to eat! Custom made pizza with unlimited toppings! You can see your pizza being made in front of you. Each topping is measured in a scoop and spread lightly over the pizza then put into the fiery oven. Just wish all the toppings came out hot, the pre-cooked meat toppings were a little cold still, but the dough and cheese turned out just right. Overall great selection of toppings and good flavor fun."}
{"text":"I walked into this pizza joint cause my friend was raving about it, as I walk in we were the first ones in line! You thought Burger Kings slogan fits by saying \"Have it your way\" we'll listen here buccaroooo this place is the definition of have it your way! Pick your sauce and cheese BAM pick your veggies BAM pick your meats Wamm BAM thank you MAM!! As I was picking my meats I turned over to my friend and I noticed 27 people behind me!! I was holy crap I'm either higher than my uncles cholesterol or this place just got slammed!! So as I waited for my glorious pizza to be ready I got a water cup and couldn't decide if to really put water or go for the sprite fill up.... but they were hawking me for taking si long to order that I decided to go with the water before they UFC armbarred me. Finally the pizza came and boy that first bite was heaven! Everything was super fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Pieology took up a nice spot in my heart after my first visit. The customization that you can put into your pizza is just something else. The different cheese, toppings, and how much you can add to your pizza makes this awesome for me. I love that I can choose a lot of toppings and it all costs the same price. I use the motto, if it's good, just put it in, and that is exactly what I do. I can't argue with the flat rate for customizing a pizza and nobody should be able to too. Give this place a visit!"}
{"text":"When you go here, don't order a predictable pizza or your expectations won't be met.  I ordered the pre-designed Glad to Meat You and was let down big time.  I enjoyed the crispness of the crust but everything else about it fell short.  For the price, I expected better than Venezias ... Stop!  Hammer time, because Pieology couldnt touch this.  I'm guessing, like MOD Pizza or Fired Pie, your money is better spent at Pieology on a more creative pie.  When it comes to the red sauce, Pieology needs more nom-ology.  I'll try em again another time and revise if I'm delighted."}
{"text":"I came here the other day and the food is always great. One of my favorite pizza places to go I highly recommend it, also the workers are great, this employee named Isaac was really helpful and was a great person, made my trip to this place amazing. I'm always satisfied coming here."}
{"text":"Chose this place through UberEATS and I am pretty impressed. I ordered the smokin buffalo chicken and the classic margherita which were good . I love the thin crust but wish it was a bit crispier , I love a cracker like crust . The savory herb butter strips were a bit bland but the price is good. The cinnamon sugar strips were very tasty and simple . Overall I'm happy with this place Im sure ordering delivery could have affected the quality, next time we will try dining in ."}
{"text":"pieology is the place to go! the service was amazing. jose and jordan were very kind and made our pizzas very quick. the food was inexpensive and so delicious i'm coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but there were just a couple of issues on my first visit. 

Ordered the BBQ chicken pie and was surprised that they don't put the sauce on the pie before they put it in the oven. Hmmm, that's a first. Anyway, I paid, grabbed a drink, and proceeded to head for a table to patiently await for lunch to get out of the oven. When the pie was finished it was delivered to my table--with absolutely no sauce on it anywhere. The following interaction went something like this:

Server: \"Would you like BBQ sauce on the pie?\"

Me: \"Yes, that would be a good idea.\"



The blues music they were playing was lovely."}
{"text":"Spent $33 on pizza here tonight. First and last time I will visit. 
Ordered via phone, order repeated to me via same phone call. Paid via credit card over phone. 
Picked up pizzas, service great in-store. 

Got home, there is pepperoni/ham meat item all over one of the pizzas. The entire thing. 
As a strict vegetarian, this was not ok. 

Called the store, they told me I could come back for a new one. I said No, I would like a refund. My children are getting ready for bed and I don't have more time tonight. I asked for a refund again, to which I was told no again. He said I could come back next time for a pizza on them. I said I wouldn't be coming back after being denied twice for a refund. He asked a manager who said no refunds given. Really? 

I'm a vegetarian who just paid for a pizza my family cannot eat, and it's in the garbage. 

Giving no refunds for guest issues is terrible business practice, and I won't be supporting a company that doesn't take care of their guests for situations like this. Totally turned off."}
{"text":"Amazing service if you are gluten free. If it's an allergy they will change their gloves and the utensils for the sauces. Loved the buffalo chicken pizza!"}
{"text":"I am Deaf. I use American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate. While I was at Pieology  with my family, ordering pizza, there was a person who work there, Anthony. He knows how to sign! It made it so easier for me. I was able to order a pizza clearly without any problems! Also, he recommended a special crispiness that was truly delicious. It made my day! 

This place is an amazing place to get some fresh and homemade pizza at! If you are in this area, I recommend you to go to this place for Pizza."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wondered into here one day with somewhat low expectations. Once the pizza arrived it was gone within minutes. The customized pizza was a genius idea. And the pizza is finished cooking within minutes; hardly any wait time. One of the girls Camryn came by and started a conversation with us and she was just splendid. We will continue to return."}
{"text":"Options for a pizza place is key. Admittedly, i go to Mod pizza, and was expecting similar options, but wasn't greeted with that expectation. I did however get non fire burned pizza, dry bread, and limited options. 

Menu options for toppings are not fresh, and about half the options of MOD. I also wish the sauce had a flavor to it. Seriously tasted out the bag. Also, you only get one option size for pizza. Its a tad hard to justify a med pizza for one person. I also didnt like that there was no real fire burned over..it was a heated over with a small strip on the back to look like fire. 

I wouldn't repeat."}
{"text":"I come to Pieology multiple times a week because the pizza is amazing but the customer service is horrible. I don't understand why they let you customize a pizza when the employees don't understand what \"double\" or \"extra\" means... Everytime I go I get the same three toppings and I always ask for extra or double but I never receive it and I have to keep saying more, more, more, more and even then the pizza is still not to my liking and I get very impatient and just decide to take what they give me even though it's not what I ordered. Today 12/10/2016 at 6:03pm was the last time that I ever visit Pieology. I had to do the same song and dance with them more and extra but this time around the employee who was making my food told me this isn't Burger King I can't have it my way.... Seriously, seriously?  you're going to say that to a paying customer! I ended up walking out of there and went somewhere else to eat and I can say I will never return."}
{"text":"I love it. You could feed a family of 4 with well  below $20.00. They have the best drinks too, I love the mango."}
{"text":"We'll be back - been to restaurants in SoCal and now in our town! Mike made sure we were happy. Good 'pies' especially if you like thin crust style."}
{"text":"Chipotle for pizza. That's really all that needs to be said. 

But to go into more detail, I really loved every part of my pieology experience tonight. My friend had been before and had told me how delicious it was. And i love pizza. So we went on a Sunday night after having a glass of wine at our apartments. This is the Chandler location, by the mall. 

5 stars for cleanliness. From beginning to start, floors to tables everything was clean. Clean food prep area, clean soda area, clean everything. 

5 stars for friendliness. All of the workers were so friendly that I felt like I fit right in. Colin at this location made my pizza and was super nice the whole way through. They were friendly making the pizzas, friendly delivering them to our table, and even brought us napkins. 

5 stars for taste. Seriously I may be a pizza God. The toppings I chose were delicious. Original crust with red sauce, and garlic herb around the crust. Tomatoes, roasted red peppers, garlic, mushrooms, artichoke, chicken, and bacon. With mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Delicious! 

Needless to say, I will be back. Probably every weekend."}
{"text":"My niece is a true vegan and she recommended Pieology and said it's her fav vegan pizza. I was a bit skeptical because I tried vegan pizza from another place and ended up throwing it out. however, it's Valentine's Day and my husband and I are on the tail end of a specific eating program and  so I decided to try it.  We both loved it. My husband is a meat eater and he gave it a thumbs up. We can't wait to try non vegan options. Also the service was great!"}
{"text":"Fast and quick is what I like!! Pick a crust, sauce, cheese, toppings, meat & bake!!! Every pizza is 11.5'' crusts and unlimited toppings for $7.99!! I'm a happy eater!!"}
{"text":"This 5 star review is easy! The food here was delicious! The food here comes in neck and neck with Custom Built pizza. I actually think this place was a bit better. Prices are reasonable. $8 for all the toppings that you want.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was extremely clean. I'll be going back here probably next week already.  Easy parking here too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. They now serve dairy-free cheese, which is AWESOME! They also have gluten-free pizza bread to choose from (for an additional cost) and a yummy variety of different toppings, whether it be cheese, meat, or veggies.

If I could make any recommendation for the management to consider, I think they would really do well with actual plates. Sharing a pizza is great, but when you're both trying to use the pan as a plate, it's not the best. If you want plates, you have to go to the register, where they actually provide you a to-go box instead. 

Parking in this area can be pretty difficult in the daytime but I do think this is worth the wait! 

Customized pizza? Yessss!"}
{"text":"The concept is unique; Jason and Z are wonderful Managers and ensured our experience was a pleasant visit.  The pizza's were DELICIOUS!!!!!!  Thanks"}
{"text":"Just had my first meal here and I love it!!  Exactly what I wanted and it tastes fantastic despite my amateur status as a pizza artist! :-)"}
{"text":"The 2 star isn't about the pizza it's for the customer service. Been to this location a few times since they opened. The pizza has always been great, but the customer service needs work. I brought my son in for lunch and the girl asked what crust we wanted. I tell her what i want then my son tells her and she's just staring at him with a weird face. So I said twice he wants the original crust. She still staring and then asks my son did you just take a picture of me. He said no, She said it looks like you did. I checked his phone to make sure he didn't take one, his screen was on a text and i said he didn't take a picture of you. She said well it looked like he did. So my son raises his phone to show her his screen and she didn't even apologize for accusing him. Just very rude and embarrassing when there's other customers eating. We will definitely not be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, and the customer service is outstanding. They treat every customer like its their first time there. I even ordered my pies to go stepped outside to my car, and the gentleman who made my pie brought it to my car.... Customer service at it's finest, please don't change..."}
{"text":"This was originally called project pie and we have always loved ordering our custom made pizzas from them because it's a flat rate for unlimited toppings. I hear of other locations opening up all over and back in Hawaii but I heard it's just not the same as it is here!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and love the price but I am not happy that you have to give them your credit card information on the phone for a pick up order. They should offer a safer way of paying."}
{"text":"Wow......this is a pizza version of Chipotle. Amazing location, great ambiance and amazingly clean. Impeccable unmatched customer service by the operating partner, Diara, Dee and Jerry. Refused to accept a tip even though I pushed it. The quality of pizza is without par. Super quick ticket time. Great thin crust so no worry about excess carbs. Try the buffalo pizza for a spicy delicious treat! Thanks Pieology~"}
{"text":"Biggest bang for your buck! Literally some of the greatest pizza I've had an all so inexpensive! The staff is nice, they have good options and I love the crust. Def will be repeat customer"}
{"text":"This is something that came to this neighborhood that made me so happy I couldn't wait for opening day. Well here it is, my first visit to my local Pieology. 

I was very happy with the help in building exactly what I wanted. Everything tastes as I had hoped and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I first tried Pieology back in my hometown of Tustin, CA, and since I got a gift card for Pieology for Christmas, I decided to try one of the Vegas locations. There are just a handful here in town, and the one inside MGM Grand happened to be the closest to my home.

There wasn't much of a wait when I arrived, and this location is also a bit small, but it still has all the toppings. Pizzas are made fresh to order and it's a set price for custom pizzas (unlimited toppings). I feel like the price is a tad higher than I remember, but it's still a decent-sized pizza.

The ingredients are top-notch quality, and I love thin crust pizza so the crispy pizzas here are perfect suited to my tastes. Service here was also very friendly overall.

Pielogy serves up some great pizzas, and I can see why the chain has undergone such tremendous growth!"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough about this place!

I mean what an amazing concept!  Great prices and the ability to customize your pie!

They use fresh ingredients and the crust...oh the crust! I'm a thin crust person and this one is up there in quality and taste! 

Hope it makes it...even though I miss the establishment that used to be in this location! ;-)"}
{"text":"Though the concept is rather innovative and prices kept fairly inexpensive, the pizza itself was mediocre. Reminiscent of Chipotle's assembly line model, customers are able to pick and choose unlimited toppings on an 11.5 inch pizza for only $7.95. This includes all sauces, cheeses, meats, veggies. No need to worry about guac being extra. (Not that they have guac here... just saying you can indulge to your artichoke heart's desire...yes, they offer an artichoke topping...I'll stop.) 

They fire it up in the stone oven and about five minutes later, deliver it to your table. Voila! It was satisfying, but the pizza's relatively thin and the crust appeared to be burnt. Not sure if it's due to the fact that it's cooked in the fire stove. On the bright side, it's not too heavy on the stomach. I'm all about the crust though, so it was disappointing that my favorite part was not only charred, but missing."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!! Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of all of the build your own pizza concept restaurants. Here is why I am a fan:
1) It is reasonably priced. 
2) Everyone in your party gets exactly what they want. Our son builds a garden, while I build a heart attack on crust. At least I taught my child to eat healthy, :-)
3) They have a very large variety of high-quality toppings.
4) They are fast.
5) The staff at this particular location were very friendly and accommodating. (This is a huge factor for me with any business.)
6) The pizzas are more then big enough for one person. However; I didn't share mine ;-). 
Yep...that's a picture of my pizza. Don't judge me, LOL!"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing! Crust is awesome and the staff is super nice and very polite. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing... so good. I have no complaints! Every time I try something new!"}
{"text":"Great, thin crust pizzas that you can choose all the toppings you want for the same price !  Quick, friendly service too!  Great option for lunch or a quick dinner!"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried Pieology today for the first time. Besides great food, the customer service was outstanding. Definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly, high energy staff! The 2 girls working up front were very helpful. Pizza was great, and I was surprised they let you have unlimited toppings at a set price!"}
{"text":"I have been to this pizza joint 2 times now.  The first time was 2 weeks ago at their soft opening.  They were giving away free pizza and soft drinks.  Of course the line up was quite long, but still worth the wait.  I ordered their Alfredo's Alfredo and it was burnt around the edges and a little on the dry side.  A little more Alfredo sauce and it would have been good.  My second time here was much better.  I selected all my favorite toppings on a pesto sauce base. The guy behind the counter didn't know which one was the pesto sauce base, but to his defense, the pesto sauce didn't look like pesto sauce to me either.  

With unlimited toppings, this fast and friendly service pizza joint is conveniently located off of the Strip.  From the moment you step into this place, the vibe is energetic.  You pick the crust, the sauce and toppings and they flash cook it in just a few minutes.  I love the concept, the ingredients are fresh and the pizza is quite tasty.  For only $8 a pizza, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"So disappointed come here all the time with my husband. The brought my husbands pizza first and not mine. Then after I went up to the register they said they burned it and there making it again. Waited for 20 min and they still didn't remake it. My husband had to go complain to the manger then she herself mad the pizza for me. Totally time waiting for my pizza 40 min. Very unorganized and unapologetic!"}
{"text":"custom made pizza, enough side. Although i would say it's on par with other custom pizza places like Blaze Pizza"}
{"text":"2nd time try and it was delicious! Definitely wins the 5 star review today for deliciousness."}
{"text":"Decent priced, size, pizza. Assembly line style pizza making. I like being able to see how my food is being handled. A pizza can serve 1-2 people depending on appetite. The thing i like is you can choose different flavor sauces instead of the traditional marinara sauce."}
{"text":"After seeing all my yelper friends in Cali post pictures and write favoring reviews about Pieology, I was excited to find out a location had opened up in Downtown Summerlin. I came for dinner and walking inside I noticed they have a spacious dining area with many tables and chairs. I'd say over half of the tables were filled, so the place was busy. I was surprised that because of how busy it was that there was no line where you order your pizza, but there wasn't. Nice! The guy who took my order was very friendly and I explained it was my first time, so he let me take my time looking over the choices. The pizzas are $7.95 each and are 11.5\" in size. You also can choose unlimited toppings. 

Choose your crust: Fresh in store made crust or for an additional $2, gluten free crust.

Choose your sauce: Red sauce, herb butter or olive oil.

Choose your toppings: For cheese they have mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan and ricotta as options. They have a variety of meats and veggies for toppings ranging from the usual suspects pepperoni, sausage, black olives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers and much more. 

Add a flavor blast: Roasted red peppers, fiery buffalo sauce, pesto, bbq sauce, EVOO, black pepper, dollops of red sauce and ranch dressing can be added to any pizza. 

I ended up choosing a pizza with red sauce, mozzarella and ricotta on the whole pizza and then 1/2 pepperoni and mushroom and 1/2 tomato and pineapple. They said the pizza would be ready in about 4 and a half minutes. I walked to the register and paid. Our order was to-go, so we waited at the counter for the pizzas. My pizza came out before my husbands and it was just left in a open box until his came out. Our pizzas were ordered at the same time, so I can't figure out why mine would have been ready and his not. We started to notice the staff talking about the pizzas coming out burnt and they even made some of them over again. I noticed one of the employees using the pizza cutter to cut the burnt edges off making the pizza smaller than it should have been for that customer. When our order was finally ready, far past the 4 and a half minute wait time I was originally given, I was off to try out this much raved about pizza. 

My pizza was burnt! I was so frustrated at this. The edges were so badly burnt and it tasted terrible. The crust was burnt so badly on one half all under it. Mozzarella cheese was missing on certain parts of my pizza. There could have been more mushrooms and tomatoes on the pizza as well. I'm not sure if a lot of the toppings slid to another part of the pizza while it was baking or what, but I would have hoped when they saw my pizza that they would have made another one since it clearly looked burnt and like the toppings were oddly scattered. My pizza was also not very hot or even warm from being left out in the box for so long before giving it to me. The part of the pizza I was able to eat tasted OK, but definitely below average and nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch and like my experience at a previous Pieology location I wasn't impressed. When I walked in they were very busy and I waited in line about 10 minutes to place my order and about another 10 minutes to receive my pizza. I've dealt with this type of wait at Blaze Pizza however the employees are friendly at Blaze and don't hurry you through the line like here at Pieology. I wanted ricotta on my pizza, but after seeing it I changed my mind. The ricotta looked not fresh like it had been there a long time and there was tons of other pizza toppings on top of the ricotta. I know it gets busy and when grabbing different toppings while making a pizza they sometimes drop stuff in different areas, but it needs to be controlled and cleaned! I also noticed the lack of toppings offered compared to Blaze and wished they had more options for cheese like the ovalini mozzarella that Blaze has. I only saw one option for pizza crust while Blaze offers a high-rise crust option. Yes I am comparing the two pizza places a lot because they are trying to accomplish the same type of fast casual pizza experience yet both have differences. 

Custom Pie ($7.99) - The custom pie allows you to be creative and top your pizza to your liking all for one price. I chose shredded mozzarella, mushroom, pepperoni and pineapple. I only ate half of my pizza before trashing it because it had such a weird taste, mostly burnt. The toppings were completely uneven, the pepperoni was mostly all in the center of the pizza. The crust was so burnt especially around the edges. I don't get the hype for this place. At all. What they call pizza here is nothing more than a extra burnt thin cracker with cheese and toppings. Seriously, just take a saltine cracker, torch the sides and bottom, melt cheese on it and you'll have a Pieology pizza. I'll stick with Blaze Pizza on Decatur."}
{"text":"Wow...this is maybe the worst pizza I have had yet. Dough was chewy....toppings nonexistent. I've had better frozen pizza.   I'll post the pictures of the two pies they made for me.... Not pretty at all!"}
{"text":"Finally some value in Lass Vegas. Pizza and the concept (WOW)....I salute you. Looking forward to my return trip tonight."}
{"text":"Hello, healthy fast food pizza joint. Nice to meet you. I will now obsessively swoon over you as is fit with things I am absolutely enamored with. 

If you haven't caught onto it, this place is amazing! The pizza is on-par with the pizza at places like California Pizza Kitchen and Olive Garden, arguably even better (and cheaper!). 

Pieology is a lot like Subway in the way that customers can build their own pizza or choose a ready combination from a menu. I ordered the Hickory BBQ Chicken, and added corn, mushrooms, and pineapple to it. The pizzas here have some of the thinnest, crispiest crusts I have ever had the joy of encountering. I will admit that the pizza is smaller than I expected with just about a 4-5 inch radius, but since it only costs $8 and tastes like an epiphany to my taste buds, I can't really complain.  

The interior of this place is bright and spacious, and I am absolutely in love with the wall of quotes that customers can read while standing in line. This must be one of the cleanest and neatest fast food locations I have been at so far. 

The service is good like you would expect. The communication between the person preparing the pizza and the person cashing the customer out is flawless. It takes two to three minutes to build and pay for a pizza and five to eight further minutes to receive it - perfect timing for someone in a hurry. 

This is my new favorite pizza place. Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza.   I love that you can create your own or use one of their menu items.   Even with the menu items you can make adjustments to the pizza.   Pizza the way you like it.  8 minute bashing time and you get a great tasting pizza."}
{"text":"Tried the gluten free crust with herb butter and bunch of toppings.  I ordered it to go It took a little bit for it to come out but it was boxed up and looking good when it did come out.  It was still warm when I got it home and crisp but a little chewy as well.  Crust seemed like it had a bit of sweetness to it but otherwise was good and not overpowering the toppings.  

All in all a good pizza so I do plan on coming back again."}
{"text":"I love pizza's with unlimited toppings!  The people that work her are really nice, and the pizza is really good, and affordable.  About $8.00 for your own pizza.  I'm that girl, that loves almost all the toppings that you have to offer.  So this is right up my alley."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pieology! I've been here so many times! I love how it's all one price and you can't complain about the pizza because you made it yourself! My pizza always changes depending on my mood and what I want. The service can take awhile but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The food at this location tasted like cheap frozen pizza to me. Everything we ordered tasted undercooked, very much so. We ended up throwing away a good portion of the food. We were excited to see this store open up but will not be back."}
{"text":"I had great service. It was mid morning. Not a bad place at all. Got my pizza quick and was on my way. Many selections andI will go back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food was great tasting. They dont have hamburger/beef for a topping which is my preferred but made it work with other toppings."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, especially on Mondays when they have the $5 pizza deal. We all got to choose whatever we want, so no one is ever disappointed. They have lots of vegetarian options, plenty for meat eaters, and gluten friendly as well as dairy free if requested. Everyone in my family was happy with their pizza, and we will return again and again. Such a fun place to eat!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza for a quick bite. Same concept as Chipotle, Subway or Cafe Rio. Choose what you'd like, they make it in front of you and then cook it quickly. 

We ordered a Caesar salad and a chicken BBQ pizza. The crust was thin and crunchy with a little char you come to know and love like your local pizzeria, the BBQ sauce was flavorful and sweet and we received it all in a timely manner. I wouldn't recommend ordering from this place for take out. I think their food is better eaten on site. 

It was a bargain for less than $20. I think one pizza and a salad for two people was just the right amount of food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.   I love how you can add as much toppings as you want on the pizza.   I love putting the garlic herb butter on the whole pizza/edges.    The staff are extremely friendly and cool"}
{"text":"Average service speed. Sauce wasn't anything to write home about. Your feminist college girlfriend will love it. Thin crust with little crunch  and servers that seem to be aware of how bad it is. Cheap except the drinks where 2.25 a pop. This is the equivalent of turning off the football and eating tortinos at home. Really wasn't expecting it to be this bad, you can probably pass."}
{"text":"Mod pizza used to be my favorite place to go for this type of establishment. Unfortunately with getting a recent gluten allergy the gluten free crust over there Kinda sucks. The gluten-free crust here however is actually great tasting and a good Texture. When I told Them had a food allergy they completely change their gloves use different utensils to prepare my food so no cross contamination. Very good pizza, a little pricey and could use some more seating."}
{"text":"It's a very thin crust pizza that only takes 5 minutes. Nice for takeout and to have as an appetizer with a glass of wine. Not a heavy meal.  Light and tasty."}
{"text":"Food was good BUT the customer service was severely lacking!  The guy at the check out simply looked at me as if it was my job to know what he wanted me to say.... not kool.  And the music was atrocious! Almost depressing... not a vibe overall, between the customer service issues and the bizarre music."}
{"text":"Pizza is my favorite and being able to create my own was amazing! I love that it's unlimited toppings for only $7.99 and it was very filling. Everyone was also very friendly and fast service. I love Pieology it's definitely one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Fast hot delicious pizza. Employees dont understand babies and children can get burned when placing a piping hot pizza inches from my 1 year old's face. I move the first pizza immediately and the employee must have thought that that the mirrored spot was nice enough to try to place our second pizza down in front of my 3 year-olds face. My wife grabbed the plate just as it was placed. Besides that it was a great experience and great food."}
{"text":"So I have been debating to come to this location since I have been loyal to Blaze Pizza that is literally on the other side of bell road. Craving a personal pan pizza and said what the hey ! Ordering online and creating your own personal pan pizza is super convenient. I am a white sauce guy so went with the white sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese , bacon and mushroom toppings. I did like they have an assortment of sauces or dressing for the pizzas, so I went with the pesto sauce. I did fail to mention that I added cilantro to the mix and let me tell you that the cilantro was was set this pizza above Blaze or fired pie place ! All of the ingredients mentioned are super fresh and the pizza dough was thin and crispy so that made me feel better with the carb intake! Lastly, the unsweetened watermelon tea is the first of its kind that I have ever tasted and was delicious! This location is definitely worth a try and coming back repeatedly! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and atmosphere!  Great place to share with family and friends!  
Pizza came out quick and hot!  
Friendly staff and was very helpful!"}
{"text":"First time at pieology was amazing. Colin and Josh were amazing! Super nice and provided wonderful customer service. The pizza was amazing. Definitely will be coming here instead of fired pie from now. Thanks again Colin and josh for the best service I've had anywhere in a really long time."}
{"text":"I love Pieology and prefer it to Blaze and some of the other competitors. That being said, I cannot give it 5 stars and here's why. This particular location has a staffing issue. There are only ever 3-4 employees working so the lunch and dinner rushes are awful. It can take upward of 30 minutes just to order a pizza at lunchtime. This place is great if you want pizza at 3 or 4 in the afternoon but that's not when most people eat. Not to mention the quality of their food goes down considerably because they're rushed and make mistakes. Twice now I've gotten pizza where the two slices didn't get any cheese of. Toppings whatsoever and the time before that, they burned one side. If you want food that's consistent and quick at lunchtime try the Chipotle next door or Raising Canes down the street. However, if you have a hankering for pizza during and off time, I definitely recommend these guys because when they're not busy, the food is great."}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal. And the food was even better. I felt horrible cause I dropped my pizza all over the floor and they were quick to come over and help clean up and start making me another pizza. I am definitely coming back. Great costumer service!!!"}
{"text":"This is not Project Pie, it's a Pieology. No crust options and limited toppings. Blaze Pizza is a better choice for food, but service was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is to be avoided. No hospitality, no focus on food safety and over priced unless you choose every ingredient. Staff was horrible and 2 employee were arguing right in front of us. The few ingredients I ordered was so skimpy, not to mention amount of cheese is embarrassing. Pathetic, how do these big restaurant chains stay successful. BTW, tried 3 times and consistently bad each time, I'm insane I guess."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best pizza in Vegas! Affordable, pick your own ingredients"}
{"text":"Ok.  I had to come try this subway like pizza joint!  Pick your pie, sauce, and toppings, OK with me.  So I got the wheat, red sauce, chicken, fresh basil, and BACON!  Yes, bacon!  I love the ease of ordering.  They threw my pizza into the oven and I paid.  Got my drink and sat for 5 mins and my pizza was delivered to my table.  It was HOT and tasty!  I would like the crust a tad crispier!  The place was pretty packed and many un-wiped tables.  I wiped my own and sat down."}
{"text":"On a budget good cheap eats. The pizza was good because I got to create to my liking. Both my Dad and I ate for less than $20.00 including tip with leftovers for later."}
{"text":"Finally was able to try this pizza place where you can pick and customize your very own pizza. The concept is pretty cool since you can pick as much items you want on the pizza. However the pizza was okay because the bottom of the pizza is very soggy and was not crispy. Maybe if they left it in the oven a little longer it would came out differently. It was a cool experience to try once."}
{"text":"Idea behind the place was good but execution didn't follow through. 11 inches create your own personal pizza idea was great especially if you want to make your own pizza and add crazy things to your food. 

The line was long to order food. And when the food came out, I was disappointed with the flavor. I got wheat crust with marinara and mozzarella sauce with ham, pepperoni, pineapple, jalapenos, and mushrooms. I don't usually eat salty food but the sauce really need some flavor and salt. The crust was ok. 

I think I prefer Domino's Hawaiian pizza than this."}
{"text":"Who doesn't want a custom made pizza ready in about 150 seconds! First timer here. I can get any topping I mean any just for $7.99 add $2 if you want a gluten free crust. Fast and convenient walkthrough when you order. Simple and easy menu to navigate. They also have salads for more carb free diet. Can't wait to bring friends and family for some socializing. Lovely staff. Can't get enough of the aromas, the oven, and the people who enjoy their pies."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza with a super friendly and upbeat staff. All the pizzas are the same size and price except cheese. A good deal at 8 dollars and unlimited toppings included. All looked very fresh. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was slow and lots of confusion among workers. Not sure if some of them were new employees which might have been the issue. All in all the employees were friendly. The atmosphere is great. Love the wall of quotes. We will definitely be back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday nite.. loved the atmosphere as always love the variety of toppings.. I'm huge on customer service and everytime I've come in Sean has been totally awesome... made our pizza exactly how we like it..totally welcoming and personable! I love this place! Affordable and awesome!"}
{"text":"Eat here often during my annual trips to Vegas at the MGM Grand. It's located down stairs and is a
More affordable place to eat. They serve beer and make salads and personal pizzas to order. You go down the line choosing your ingredients and then they cook the pizzas in the super hot brick oven. Always excellent. I have eaten a whole one by myself, but two can easily share one pie. Fast for a cook to order place and a very good selection of toppings to choose from. Note:  also next door to Fat Tuesday's for frozen drinks after, before, or during your visit to Pieology. One of my favorite pizza places. Sign up for club and you get something for your birthday."}
{"text":"We have tried a lot of the \"create your own\" pizza places, but hadn't been to Pieology yet. I would say that Pieology jumps to the front of the pack to tie, or even pass Fired Pie. Living in a family of four people who all like different foods, it's great to get to customize my own pizza.

Pieology seems to have a few more options than its competitors, such as thin crust or thick crust pies. They also offer a whole wheat crust. While Fired Pie seems to have a few more cheese options, Pieology  offers just as many meat and veggie options as FP. (They both have a good variety.)

All in all, Pieology was a pleasant surprise and I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  Crust was super thin which I liked.  Made my own and the toppings were on point (although I probably should have kept to 5 toppings).  Staff was cool to talk to and pie came out in less than 5 minutes.  You can easily get two meals out of one if you wanted to."}
{"text":"My first time in was on Father's Day, and it will not be my last! This pizza is incredible! Unlimited toppings for the same price!? SAY WHAAAAAT?? This place can not be beaten, especially when it comes to their customer service, primarily Joshua. He was extremely friendly and helpful, explaining all the different options and pizza combination, I'm telling you, this guy is both a pizza & customer service guru. Highly recommend,  10 out of 10, would eat again."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food pizza spot in town! This price is perfect for a nice sized pizza with unlimited toppings! Are you kidding me? Amazing! 

My boyfriend and I visited yesterday afternoon. We were greeted by an amazing girl. We told her that this was our first time there and she helped us without hesitation! She explained everything perfectly, what was popular, gave us advice about what toppings would go great. 
As a new vegetarian I was tempted to put meat in my pizza but they have plenty of protein substitutes that made my veggie pizza taste amazing! (cannellini beans). I can't wait to come back to try a different pizza!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best of all of the new pizza places that came to town in Las Vegas. Loved the crust and the different choices of sauces and toppings. Must have in Summerlin !"}
{"text":"The chipotle of fresh pizza. I enjoy creating the spicy chicken with Unlimited topping for $8.95
The service is quick and friendly. The thin crust is crunchy and not burnt like many others. I enjoy an easy healthy meal here almost once a week."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Italian pizza I recommended I wonder what mine husband and our family we will definitely be back try their Margarita Pizza that was one of our favorites"}
{"text":"This place has only been open for a couple months and I don't see them closing anytime soon! I know there are other places like this and I've been to all of them but the crispy crust got me...crispy throughout! I made my own, which I'm sure everyone does but great deal and taste amazing! Definitely going back..also great service! Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Perfect create your own pizza!! Many options, quick,easy and price is a little high but quality seems fresh and tasty!!"}
{"text":"Ok, rename to YUMOLOGY!

Choose your own toppings and have em cook your own personal pie! Pizza pie that is.
Fantastic, perfect size for one hungry person. You will have some leftovers if you try really hard not to gobble up the whole pie!
Staff is friendly, this is a plus in Vegas.
The restaurant is clean, and if you know me then you know that is important.
It is close to the University so I will be back!

XOXO Pieology, until next time..."}
{"text":"I was so extremely disappointed. Not only was all three pizzas I ordered burnt, so was everyone else in the restaurant. They even brought the pizzas to the table and laughed \"these pizzas are a little crispy sorry\". It could be the fact that the crust they use is like cracker thin. 
I asked for a drizzle of BBQ on top of my chicken pizza and it was smothered in it. It tastes terrible. 
The people sitting next to us ordered a dessert pizza (brown sugar cinnamon butter on dough, drizzled with icing) and it looked like someone smeared crap on pizza dough and then came on it. Even the lady didn't think she should be eating it. 

Super unimpressed. And I know I'm not alone as everyone in the restaurant was complaining."}
{"text":"Good concept, it's like Chipotle for pizza (they told us that when we stepped up to order). 
The pros: 
- lots of ingredients to choose from.
- quickly prepared and cooked (like under 5 minutes).
- inexpensive.
- clean .
The cons:
- only one choice of crust, and it's super thin and so-so in taste and texture.
- no anchovies! I repeat, no anchovies. Any self respecting pizza place should have. I know not everyone likes them, but some people (read: me) do!

Overall, the pros are enough to get me back now and then, But if you're looking for a more authentic pizza experience, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"How fun! It's like Chipotle, but pizza. Even the industrial looking decorations and wrap around flow of customers. You can pick whatever sauce/cheese/toppings/craziness you want. I recommend combining the herb oil and red sauce. Wish the crust was a bit thicker; I'm a deep dish sort of person. Really you need to add that oil stuff to give it any flavor, don't be boring. Service is quick, everyone should get what they want. I'll return."}
{"text":"Stayed at MGM Grand and kept passing this place on the lower level heading to my car/coming back in. I just had to try it. It's by far the best pizza I have ever had. Hands down. This place is a build your own. Same idea as chipotle, qdoba, etc. They do have selections of certain pizzas. But whats not to love about making your pizza exactly how you want it. You can choose a thin or thick crust. I'm a sucker for thin, it's not an enormous amount of dough where it focuses on the main ingredients. I highly recommend getting the herb garlic butter then they put your choice of sauce on top of it. (red sauce or Alfredo sauce). Then veggies and meats. It's $12 for UNLIMITED TOPPINGS. Usually at pizzerias, pie are already $12-$14 then $1-$2 per topping. If I had this where I lived (east coast), I would have this every single day. The flavors and freshness made my taste buds dance. I can't get over it.

The establishment seems a little modern which I loved. It was very clean and staff was very polite. 
The line can get a little long so watch what time you go. But nothing crazy. The last time I went I was checking out so might as well grab some lunch. It was 11:30-12 and there was 2 people in line. By the time I ordered, paid, and sat down. I only waited 4 minutes at the table and they walked over the pizza to me. 4 minutes is not bad at all! Think about it, each person they have to make a pie for. Usually the time to bake a pie, it is must longer than 4 minutes. So Bravo Pieology! This place is a must try. You won't be disappointed.

Until we meet again, Pieology."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food   My salad consisted of the freshest ingredients and I loved the fact that I could choose my own. Hubby had the gluten free crust and it was delicious. Staff was friendly and efficient and the restaurant was clean and inviting. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I was looking forward to trying this place or because there's so much hype about it...I guess I should discos that I'm not a huge pizza fan to begin with but the hubby wanted to try it so we did. It was alright, not amazing or out of this world. Pretty cool that you can customize it and make it your own for a set prize, employees were awesome and helpful, it just didn't do much for me. The pizza dough was rather bland and although I love thin crust I wasn't sure I liked this crust..I had the buffalo pizza which was pretty good but surprisingly spicy for me, I will go back because the hubby enjoyed it and maybe another pizza will do it for me...as of now I'm still on the fence about it."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite pizza places! Soon as the door opened, was greeted to a fresh smell of baked pizza. Was approached by the very friendly Employee at the counter and let her knew it was my first visit at pieology. She explained very nicely about how the ordering works. I was amazed that I had a free reign of topping choice at a very resonance price. Store is kept clean and they bring the food to you. They also have Powerade and fruit punch for fountain drinks! I automatically love places that have those two. Didn't notice any negatives from this place. Food is great, great prices, Friendly staff and clean store. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend who highly recommended. Tried 1/2 Alfredo's Alfredo & 1/2 hickory BBQ chicken. 
Also got the free herb butter strips. 
The Alfredo's 1/2 was pretty good but the BBQ 1/2 was delicious! Wouldn't waste my calories on the butter strips. I love you can create your own pizza & priced very well. They did slightly over bake my crust, part of it anyway. I'd definitely come back & creat my own next time, and I'll mention to please not over bake. Everyone was super friendly & helpful!"}
{"text":"I usually don't go out and eat much because of poor customer services and what not but when I came here with my family people were so nice and the energy was great, the blond girl who had cashed out my order was super helpful and was patient with me being difficult and I hadn't seen her stop smiling once.. that's the customer service to bring back a customer guaranteed! Will definitely come back soon! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Tried this place out last night- and was not disappointed. Place looks clean, which is good for MY OCD! Menu looks ez enough that it wasn't intimidating, staff was friendly and welcoming and even checked in on us while we were eating.

Food was excellent. I LOVE the crispy thin crust, better than Fired Pie crust imo. I ordered half Mad To Meat You and half Hickory BBQ Chicken.  The BBQ sauce ratio was just right and wasn't overpowering, which is my preference. Would come back again for that pizza craving!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't as friendly as the last time I was here. I couldn't hear them saying \"hello welcome to pizzology\" the stuff was like zombies. There was two guys who I could hear them clearly and the rest (3) was like zombies. Please train your workers to speak up while talking to the customers, please and thanks!"}
{"text":"Can miss. You pick the ingredients and get your hot pie within five minutes. Hard to beat the under $10 price too."}
{"text":"Aleigh had really bad customer service at the register. She gave multiple customers a really bad attitude and made another put the card in her hand or she just left her hand hanging there.. Very rude. That's also why I put it as 3 stars. A lot of the time I go in there to a rude employee. Other than that the food is addicting. I go there all the time!! It's a perfect size pizza with any toppings you want and it's always cooked perfect. Probably the best pizza place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok I was really excited to check this place out. When you walked in it smelled so good! There were 2 workers behind the counter and the place had a couple people inside but no line. I wasn't going to eat here because I just ordered pho from next door but then I seen they had vegan cheese and couldn't help myself.

I immediately regretted ordering as soon as I really stopped and looked around. Behind the counter where you choose your toppings was dirty but I told myself hey they were probably busy right before we came in and didn't have a chance 2 wipe down. But they should've really wiped down before starting a new order, I wouldn't have minded waiting a min for them to make sure it was sanitized. 

Then I was shocked as we walked up to the cash register and seen behind the counter! First of the oven was so cool I took a pic and got close up and ewww dirty! The floors behind the counter super dirty and all the tables were dirty an not wiped down. By the soda fountains the floors were filthy and not just things spilled but a layer of dirt so thick it had to have been that way for a long time!

The guy cooking our pizza took them out of the oven and sat them on a paper but the wooden boards were also dirty and were not wiped. Neither one of the workers looked concerned or seemed to care about and of the mess and dirty stations and tables and it wasn't like it was busy so one of them could've easily been cleaning up.

I also explained to the girl it was my first visit there and she wasn't helpful at all and just stared at us and it made me feel like a bother to ask questions.

Sad really this place seems like it could really have some potential if the hired people who cared and did their jobs. A good cleaning some better customer service and this place would awesome! The fact they offer vegan options as well I really hope to see them make some changes. 

But I will have to say I will not be going back with this place given the poor customer service and the unsanitary conditions it was in. 2 down!"}
{"text":"My pizza was pretty thin and small. More like a $9 appetizer. It was under cooked and chewy. For the price you would be better off going someplace else. This just sucked."}
{"text":"Went here on opening day....the pizza is ok, but I honestly prefer the fast fired pizza across the street....crust is a bit dense for my liking, pepperoni slices are the cheap small ones that curl up when cooked too long, and, I don't know if they do this outside of their opening days or whatnot, but the staff was loud and trying to hype up the line too much, like Cafe Rio does; very annoying and distracting.  However, for the price, the pizza was good, ingredients were fresh, and the place was clean. You might very well like it, but I can't honestly say it's my first choice for pizza in the area."}
{"text":"Love being able to choose what you want on your pizza? This is definitely the place to go! They have custom pizzas and also signature pizzas. They do custom salads too! Staff is energetic and friendly. Cannot wait to come again."}
{"text":"Who can argue with customizable pizza? Whenever I used to visit chino hills in California, I always make my relatives take me hear because who doesn't love pizza? Don't trust anyone that doesn't like pizza. 

So when you walk in they ask you what kind of sauce. Do yourself a favor and get the herb buyer AND marinara sauce, you're welcome! After that you get to pick all the toppings your hungry heart desires. Might not want to go a little too crazy though because it might get a little soggy. But hey it's a personal pizza and you're not sharing so get whatever you want!

After they bake it, you have the option to put sauces after too! I like to get pesto drizzled on it! 

A personal pizza for about $8 is definitely worth it. I'd come here more regularly if I didn't mind gaining 2863672 pounds, but when I'm having a pizza craving, this is the spot to go."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will be back, the food was awesome the employees were very friendly and Dave the gm was nice I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't tried it"}
{"text":"Good build your own pizza restaurant.  Cooked fast and served HOT!  Lots of fresh topping choices.  Just enough crust so it crisps nicely in the oven.  Really like the fresh brewed watermelon tea."}
{"text":"Great custom pizza, great atmosphere, and awesome staff!!! Marcus and Jason were very friendly and helpful when it came to making the custom pizza!!"}
{"text":"I'm SO happy Pieology has followed me all the way from Fullerton (home to the OG Pieology) to Phoenix after my big move. Pieology was my college godsend providing me with 2 meals for the low price of $8, and now it has come to support me post-grad. Great thin crust pizza, check. Customizable, quality, not to mention unlimited toppings, check. Price that a broke college student can afford, check. Overall it's a great quality pizza you can have exactly your way, and it's a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Ok ...let me set the scene picture it Sicily 1921 ... ok seriously it's Thursday night .. 530 .. and 1 person is working the line ..1 person working the oven and 1 person whose \"delivering\" pizzas to people's table ... so I waited in line basically 20-25 minutes with 3 people ahead of me because 1 PERSON IS WORKING THE LINE!!!! I'm not terribly impatient but if you've been to blaze or pizza rev which are similar concepts then you know usually 1 person preps the dough .. 1 person over veggies and 1 person over meats ... plus the person working the oven ... so after giving the evil eye the young man who is \"delivering\" pizzas decides he will help speed up the line ... by the time I get to ordering there are an additional 5 people behind me ... idk just overall slow .. I'll stick to blaze or pizza rev ..!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life.  Something about making my own pizza adds something very special to it as well.  I usually get the garlic herb and butter with mozzarella cheese, basil, peppers, pineapple (yes this belongs on pizza I dont care what gordon ramsay says he is an idiot sandwich and a donkey), cherry tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes, pepperoni and bacon and when this delicious combination is cooked and touches my taste buds for the first time I can tell you what there is not greater pleasure my mouth has ever experienced before in my life.  

Italians are swimming across the Atlantic Ocean and running all the way to the west coast just to smell this pizza it is so delicious.  The price is also just so amazing to I mean you get a whole pizza to yourself for like 10 bucks I mean you cant beat that.  

So if you like pizza come here, if you don't like pizza come here but Pieology will change your mind and if you are dead then come back to life just to eat this pizza so you can die in happiness."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Best meal for the best price I've had all week.  I'll def come back again."}
{"text":"I am not a pizza kind of person and that said it would be the last option I would choose for lunch. I had heard about this place and wanted to try to change my opinion. The place looks like any other franchise chains like chipotle or pei wei. The place was clean and service was quick. 

I ordered the rustic veggie, the pizza dough base was done in front of me and one can add any number of toppings they want. The thin crust and fire baked was spot on. The sauce was delicious. I could eat the whole pizza easily. I loved every bit of it, this was one of the best pizzas I have had. 

The price is remarkable and would recommend it to pizza and non lovers."}
{"text":"My first pizza was raw then I got my second one they forgot oregano, but tasted better.  The staff was friendly, but the guy that rang up my order, didn't know what he was doing. The store smelled like a sewer. They had the doors opened, it didn't help. I would not return there."}
{"text":"Not a bad pie!     I had the Jalapeno and Pepperoni.     Great crust.    This is not your standard grease wheel pizza place.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Pieology is as expected...nothing to rave about but good enough to go back for more. 

Who doesn't love a custom creation? 

I like how their pizza is thin crust and crispy!

I admit to being very picky with marinara sauce so I went the bbq sauce route. I chose jalapeños, bacon, chicken, and of course mozzarella. I was feeling a little crazy and also thru som corn on it....and it was real good 

Service is nice and quick and they have lots of indoor and outdoor seafood available! 

They also had different dough options to choose from!"}
{"text":"Really great pizza! Great toppings & thin crust!! I got a Meatman with pineapples & jalapenos...so good! Pizza is done in 4 minutes so it's super fresh. My daughter got an all pesto with pepperoni & black olives that she loved! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My go to custom pizza joint. Right down the street from my house so it is nice and convenient. The pizzas at always delicious and prepared quickly. I have never seen this place understaffed and consistently has customers throughout the day. I highly recommended this custom pizza over others because of the amount of options you have for toppings here. Once you eat here you'll miss these options elsewhere. 

The restaurant itself is very neat with a wide open feel. Always a place to sit and the furniture has an industrial look. Extremely friendly staff would be my final note. 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   Can't get any more fresh than cooked in front of u.  The staff is always so kind and I love coming here.  :)"}
{"text":"Went on pi day, 3/14 for their deal. We've also tried Mod Pizza and Your Pie, but Pieology is my new favorite! Great crust, yummy sauce, tons of toppings to choose from. I love that they have ricotta as an option! Will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've ever had. A must try. I tried the thin crust and it wasn't a disappointment. And don't forget the lemonade! The unlimited toppings crispy crust, and excellent  service will have me coming back. It's located on the bottom floor of the MGM Grand near the Uber pickup."}
{"text":"Nice pizza place! Friendly stuff and delicious pizza!!!
I will recommend it to everybody!"}
{"text":"Amazing gluten-free pizza!  My sensitivity to gluten isn't extreme (not like celiacs), so places like this that can serve gluten-free items that may come in slight contact with flour are fine for me.  They do their best to avoid cross contamination, but it's a small kitchen (so be prepared for that). 

Having said all that, they have the BEST gluten-free pizza I have EVER had.  EVER!  We were visiting Las Vegas for a week and once I found these guys, we went back pretty much every day.  Great staff, amazing food.  I highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is amazing! There was also awesome service particularly from Evan. He was super helpful and the pizza turned out great! Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Ate here with my friend, for the first time. It was a pleasant experience. You can pick unlimited toppings for your pizza or place an order for a premade type from their list. I'm guessing they're a sister company with Chipotle? The set up is the same. But it was pretty good and it took maybe less than 5 minutes to bring out food to the table."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, I really didn't expect it. The options for sauces was a surprise, from pesto, red sauce, & garlic sauce. They had different cheeses & so many toppings I hesitated a lot. Next time I come I will edit my salad better. It was kind of expensive, but the flavor shocked me. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Spent 3 days with the family in Vegas, this was their favorite meal. Great pizza, and done 3 minutes after they fire it up. Didn't break the bank either."}
{"text":"Tried it the first time on Friday. Not bad. you can put anything you want on it. $7.95 not a bad price. It is a chipotle subway style type of service line. The pizza cooks in 5 mins. which  really means the dough, because the toppings seem precooked. my husband tried to get all the veggies and chicken, but when they got to the second part they forgot the chicken. it happens I guess. it's not fancy dining so i don't expect great service."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Got to make it exactly how I wanted it.  Was very good that night, and the next morning!  :)"}
{"text":"Sure glad I came back to Pielogy. Not by choice but because we wanted to support Somerset Losee's fundraising efforts and to spend time with my kiddo's taekwondo instructors at Victory Martial Arts Deer Springs which just happened  to be on the same night.

I have to say I am impressed. The place was PACKED on a Friday night but the staff never missed a beat. I am particularly amazed by how they don't ask for your name but come to deliver your pizzas right at your table. With that huge crowd, I probably have trouble recognizing my own face...haha!

Surprisingly, cardboard crust is gone....yeeeah! My pizza was sooooo good, i couldn't believe it was  from the same restaurant. I had herb butter, red sauce, a bunch of veggies and meats, shaved Parmesan and a sprinkling of basil in mine....num num num. The churro pizza was still a crowd pleaser. Everyone loved their pizzas of choice . Great night all around.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Pieology!
Jake and his staff are fantastic people. They truly care about their customers. I can't thank them enough for helping turn a special day into an exceptionally special day.
I would recommend Pieology when you're in the mood for a personalized pizza experience."}
{"text":"Mmmm!! All I can is it is BOMB! Fresh personal pizza (although it can be shared between 2) at a great price. I believe all pizzas are just under $8, which is not only cheap but you get good quality.  You create your own pizza and then it is ready in about 5 mins. Oh and a plus is that toppings aren't extra!"}
{"text":"I chose this place after hearing it was like Pizza revolution which I've tried before, but I was wrong, they put very limited amounts of cheese on my pizza and said that was their limit, I asked to put cheese on top of my order another thing pizza Rev has done for me and gladly, they refused. Yet the person behind me in line had twice as much cheese as I had. Not happy at all I can say even before tasting it, it will already be bitter. For 11.95 for a drink and pizza get an unlimited topping with no restrictions at Pizza Revolution. Now I see why they are a revolution and not a theology."}
{"text":"Dude. This place is simply bomb! Pizzas made the way you want them! Unlimited toppings? YOU BET. Tons of options? OF COURSE! The crew is awesome and us always so friendly. Very inviting place. Always clean. Looking for an adventure for your taste buds? Try the 3 cheese Alfredo and BBQ sauce. What a treat. Highly suggest this place. 10/10"}
{"text":"So yummy!! It's $7.95 for unlimited toppings. There are a lot of options for toppings! And the service was quick and easy since it's a new place. The pizza is baked in an oven right there and then and it bakes quick"}
{"text":"Often visit this place due to the fact it is very close to our house. The pizza and service are both very good! Also, as being someone who is gluten free they offer gluten free crust, which is very good, and always change their gloves before preparing my pizza. Although they do not have a dedicated gluten free kitchen, they are very carful when preparing the gf pizza. 

Would definitely recommend, especially if you are looking for a good, gluten free, inexpensive pizza!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The crust is just right for me. Unlimited toppings and cheese. I always get extra sauce and tons of veggies on my pizza. Yum"}
{"text":"Pizza Nom Nom Nom.

They're just like Fired Pie on ray next to whole foods, though I don't know which company was first. Doesn't matter, they're both awesome! 

Pieology pizza I can describe as deliciously thin and crunchy, but not crisp, which is the way I like it. The crust held up to our toppings and was really delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now after falling in love with Blazed, and I think this place is a-okay.

I think that you can't help but fall in love with the first time you try a place and compare it to other like restaurants. Like Blazed LOL.

So.. Pieology is a make your own pizza place located right off the strip. They have different meats and veggies that you can put on your pizza with no limits! The pizza is about 11 inches and costs about $9. I love this! I wish there was one by me so that everyone didn't have to agree on what type of pizza to order. GET YOUR OWN IT'S ONLY $9! Haha!

Anyways the place is just fine. My only complaint is their menu SUCKS. Well in my opinion. Their is no large listing of toppings to choose from posted. There is literally a small menu right up by the cashier that tell you 4/5 pizzas they can recommend and then the toppings are listed really small on the glass. They should have it posted so the people waiting in line could decide what they want as they wait.

Also.. I WISH they had more pizzas to choose from that the company curated for you to choose from. Sorry to compare but Blazed has like 12 pre-determined pizza and they are DELICIOUS. I know it's a make your own pizza place but I'm sure the head honchos at Pieology could totally think of some tasty flavor combinations for their customers to think of.

All in all I do like this pizza joint. They have a lot of toppings to choose from and the pizza is done within a couple of minutes."}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight in the interaction I had over the phone, I called up to order 2 pizzas and swing by and pick them up on my way home. I was informed that they don't have the ability to take phone orders that they're working with corporate to get it added but at this point they couldn't put a pen to paper and write down my order for me to swing by and pick up. Not very customer friendly, they have lost a customer for life I will not be back based on their inability to provide a solution to my needs."}
{"text":"Personalized pizza with UNLIMITED toppings for only $7.95?! I'm down. 

You can pick whatever toppings you want without having to worry about your friends want! Or you can choose one of their pre-made options. 

The hype is real for this place. Like everyone said, it's a chipotle but for pizza! They prepare and bake the pizza right in front you so it's pretty fresh. 

Loved the service! The man before me ordered 7 pizzas but the shift supervisor (I assume since he was wearing a green shirt and no name tag??) made sure that we did not feel neglected! Kudos to Jeremy on the prep line for being so accommodating to our topping requests.

Check this place out! It's never TOO busy so you'll never have to worry about the wait."}
{"text":"Wow this is a great pizza restaurant! I'm a vegan and I am stuffed to the gills! It has so many toppings and vegan cheese! They also have gluten free crust. Don't get me wrong they also had many meat toppings and they have this delicious garlic oil they put on the pizza crust that just makes it outstanding!  And talking about reasonable one can eat for $15 in a casino and be totally full that is a miracle in itself!  The service was fantastic too.  I highly recommend this restaurant and give it five stars!"}
{"text":"I love the pizzas here! You can make your own pizza and add any or all toppings you want lol and have it all put in the giant wood fired grill. They let you stand and watch as they rotate and move around the pizzas which is pretty cool to watch them cook. They have ranch available for your pizzas and salads that they make in store. It's delicious! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Gave my pizza to another person. Then took my table number to correct it. But never returned with my pizza. 20 minutes later, I explain that I have yet to receive my pizza, & they took my number identifying my order. The manager said \"my bad, we probably gave it to someone else. It'll take 5 minutes.\" 17 minutes later, still no pizza. Never coming back!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit at this location. I ordered online at 5:54PM, on a Sunday. I was directed that my pie would be ready at 6:14PM. I should up at 6:16 to pick up the pie. I stood there for 15 minutes waiting. I asked the assistant manager does it normally take this long for one pie? She was vague in her answer, \"well we never know how many walk in customers we will have.\" They put my order in the oven at 6:35, left there at 6:45. Worst customer service I have ever received from an assistant manager. They need to get it together. will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Other than the cashier trying to rush my bf and I to order, the pizza made up for it! the crust was perfect!



EDIT: The staff definitely needs to be more organized and be more knowledgeable about their products. Pizza definitely made up for it of course. =D"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this pizza is amazing. I am picky as picky can get and I can't stand when a place botches a simple cheese pizza. I ordered a modified margherita pizza and literally could not stop eating it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally visited one of the large customizable pizza chains which I'd slacked on trying. Not impressed.

Pieology Pizzeria is a restaurant at the busy corner of Flamingo and Paradise, and it shares a small plaza with several other fast-casual chains. It's not close to the highway, but it was convenient for me as I had other stuff to do in that part of town.

Pieology uses a familiar \"Chipotle-esque\" model. For a regular price of $8.45 (slightly more than local outposts of competitors), you'll be able to customize your pizza from start to finish with any toppings desired (so don't be lazy/boring and stick to limited preset combos), with crust, sauce(s), cheese(s), veggies, and meats. Pieology has a comparable array selections in most categories, give or take, but doesn't have much that's unique except perhaps for spicy buffalo sauce and a corn topping.

The main problem is that the ingredients collectively did not have enough salt. I had asked for my food to-go and was in so much of a time crunch that I ended up wolfing down the pizza both at the long communal table and after I'd taken the box to the car. I did find the thin crust crispy enough and the amount of toppings (as I hinted, I added a huge variety) to be sufficient in general, but the lack of flavor is puzzling. This is compounded by a complete lack of tableside hot sauce offerings, which competitors offer if not have in spades.

I won't go back to Pieology very often. Aside from the lack of a convenient location (for me anyway), they simply weren't as impressive in this competitive market segment."}
{"text":"I've been to my fair share of Chipotle style Pizza spot but this one took the cake. 

The only area of opportunity I recognized was when walking up to the menu the first person there asked me what kind of crust I wanted too quickly, I had to ask her to repeat herself twice before understanding the options.  I felt forced to make crust choice before even having an opportunity to look at the remaining menu.  When we sat down to eat I noticed others also had the same issue.

The pizza was great.  I devoured the whole thing and wish that I had another.  We were approached by employees who asked how the pizza was which I gave a thumbs up to as my mouth was full! :) 

The staff provided everyone leaving with a fond farewell and thank you.  

Overall this location has the service down and the food quality to add to the experience. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was so good and has the best ranch!!!! The service was great as well. They were jovial and smiling."}
{"text":"Horrific service here. Waited 10 minutes without 2 employees even acknowledging us, then one said he'd be right with us and went in the back. 5 minutes later I asked if someone else could help us and was told by the guy cutting pizzas we were just told to wait and it's only been 5 minutes. Not sure why asking for  help offended him but we left immediately. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  They are light on the toppings so feel free to ask for more.  Remember unlimited toppings. The crust was super thin.  I'm a fan of the thin crust so I loved it.  They cook the pizza pretty crispy almost a burnt crust you can ask for it to not be so brown and crispy.  Everyone was nice but not to friendly.  The best part of this place was all the quotes on the wall.  My pizza was really good I love the combo I got mozzarella and ricotta cheese,  red onion, basil, artichoke, bacon, pepporoni and sausage. Delicious. With all that on my pizza it held up pretty well. I would go here again for lunch.  Not filling enough for dinner."}
{"text":"I've had great experiences with pieology in California. However, I've been failed 3 times at this store with shoddy pizza. Super sad about it. They typically taste great when done right, but they have been consistently inconsistent."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place. I fell in love with the concept of assembling a pizza the same way you order a sandwich at Subway. The price was great and the pie was ready quick.

Unfortunately, the pie itself did not deliver. Three strikes:

The crust was cardboard. Bad texture. Dense. They were really cranking them out--I got there during the lunch rush. Maybe it needed more time to rest after coming out of the press.

The pie was surprisingly spicy.  I didn't order spicy. Don't get me wrong, I like spicy, but I didn't order it, and didn't expect it.  Maybe the red sauce got cross-contaminated with the buffalo sauce or something.

The cheese all but disappeared. I saw them put it on, but when the pie came out of the oven, it looked like there was no cheese on it. No ooey-gooey.

I'll probably give them another try and get different ingredients (and ask if they can double the cheese), but first impression was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"The service and pizza are amazing. We love it here. 4 stars because the AC seemed to be out or not working properly and it was quite warm."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but why do they make you beg for more toppings. 

Both girls act like they are paying for the ingredients out of they lie check. One girl said \" I'll give you a little more\" with a scowl on her face. 

 
Bottom line is customer service is very poor. The employees need to act like they want to be here."}
{"text":"This trend of build your own pizza joints sets well with me. I have been to few different places and each offers a similar model. It can be a dubious task telling each apart from one another. That said, the pizza I got from Pieology today was quite good.

I asked for the thick crust pizza. It was brushed on the edges with olive oil which is different than the other places do. I went with traditional sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, mushrooms, olives, minced garlic, ham, salami and bacon. Yes, that is a lot. But it was so good. And crazy filling. With that many toppings on a thick crust I should have taken some home. But I just couldn't stop eating. What does that tell you?

Despite the crust being thicker it still crisped up and was even a little charred. I had black marks on my finger tips when I was done. Just another dimension of flavor and texture. It was a perfect cook and went rather fast at that. That oven must be screaming hot.

One thing I noticed at Pieology was the drink selection. First of all, many of the soda fountainss were out of order. Makes no difference to me. I don't typically drink soda. I do, however, drink iced tea. They had three flavors, regular black tea, Mandarin green tea and watermelon tea. Watermelon tea? That sounded interesting so I tried it. I suppose there was a light sweetness to the flavor. The watermelon was more in the aroma of the tea. It was alright. I may stick with regular tea next time but watermelon tea was refreshing and cool. For a refill I went with lemonade. But not just any lemonade. No, they have three of these too. Regular, pomegranite and blood orange. I had the blood orange lemonade. It was good. Sweet. Tart. Well rounded. Again though, I think I'd stick to the regular stuff in the future. I have no issue trying new things but I love a classic.

So long story short, Pieology is another do it yourself pizza joint. I hesitate to call it a cookie cutter store but there are some very evident similarities to a few other places. And there isn't anything wrong with that. If the pizza is good, eat it. You can try all the places as I have and determine if you like one more than the other. But in my experience, they're all good. Pieology is no exception."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I had such a positive experience at this location. The staff was so friendly and helpful, especially from Sophia. It was my first time in and she helped me out through the whole process since I was confused at first and was even kind enough to check in on me later to see if everything was okay, and it definitely was. There are so many different options and combinations at pieology. The pizza tasted great and I was very impressed. I will definitely be coming back and telling friends and family about this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff are so friendly and I'm a little embarrassed to admit that my husband and I visited once a week at least for 6 weeks or so. Get the thick crust, it's so delicious. I know it may seem like just any other make your own pizza place but I promise it's not. It is really delicious. Make sure to get oregano and a little sea salt at the end. Yuuumee!"}
{"text":"Pieology is better than most of the current crop of \"Chipotle-style\" build your own pizza chains, though not quite the best I've had. The ingredients are fresh and varied. Crust is credible, but not awesome (I had the wheat crust). All their crusts are thin, and there is a gluten-free option. The wood fired oven yields a better taste than at places like Pie Five, which use a conveyor that moves the pizzas through a gas oven. Overall, it was very tasty and fast. Staff was courteous and service was excellent. If you're craving a quick pizza (or salad) for lunch or dinner, this is a pretty good place for it."}
{"text":"I came here for the pre-opening as I am a devout pizza lover lol. The staff was energized and nice. In terms of speed down the line, there can be improvement. But, I'm sure it will get better as the employees train more. 

Now, the food! I got the high rise and would highly recommend paying the extra $1 as it was fantastic! This was my first time eating at pieology so I had no clue what I was in for. The quality of ingredients surpass Blaze Pizza (across the street). They have the little pepperonis, which are my favorite. 

The most important aspect is the level of grease, or lack of grease in this case. I compare it to Blaze because they are close and direct competitors. Blaze pizza leaves grease puddles on my pizza, my fingers, and plate. Pieology does not. I did not have to dab my pizza or wipe my hands. This was the most important factor for me!

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here at k at 6 times. The only complaint I would have is they no longer offer whole wheat dough. At least they have vegan cheese still. Take what I can get."}
{"text":"Excellent.  PIEOLOGY is just plain excellent. 

I've now tried Fired Pie, MOD Pizza, 1000 Degree Pizza, Pizza Studio and now PIEOLOGY.   
PIEOLOGY is the winner. 

Why is PIEOLOGY the winner?  The sauce is better.  I read a review here that the sauce, \"...was no better than a $1 can of Hunts\".  First off, where can I buy sauce this good for a buck?  Second, what do I care?  Third, and most important, the sauce here is delicious and FLAVOR is what I'm after (Hello Chipolte?)

(And the death-knell for the other build-your-own-pizza joints is that the sauce is dead, has no flavor.  Fired Pie and MOD is the worst, no flavor to the sauce.  Pizza Studio is delicious.  1000 Degree Pizza is delicious.  But today, my preference, now, today, is PIEOLOGY.)

The toppings are seemingly standard, much like the competition.  Honestly, I don't know what to look for but it's all you could want.  The family of four behind me had no problems in ordering the pizza of your choice.   I especially like the mushrooms; they are sliced larger than other build-your-own-pizza joints and I liked them a lot.  

The Italian sausage had the weirdest color I've ever seen; off-putting no matter the reason, (server said \"spices\", I say \"no way\") but they also had a \"spicy Italian sausage\", a real sliced Italian sausage.  I chose that and it was remarkably good.

The guy who made my pizza simply could not have been more courteous, helpful, friendly.  10 out of 10 for service.  

Here's the best testimonial of all: I'LL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Really really really delicious pizzas!! I created my own and my husband got the smoking buffalo chicken and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"Hmm somehow I have never reviewed Piology. I have been here maybe 4 or 5 times. I have yet to have a bad pizza. 

The pizza is big enough to split. I ussually take half home. I almost always get the wheat crust. I like the flavor over their original. 

If you want the wheat you have to tell them because they don't press those in advance. They only press a few in advance if they are busy so it is not like they sit around. 

I have been here when it is busy and slow and they keep up well and stay friendly. 

Sauces: my fav combo is Alfredo with buffalo. 2nd is Alfredo with herb butter. 

The red sauce lacks flavor for me. 

Cheese: They have ricotta yum, also mozz, and blue cheese yuck. 

Meat: Pretty much their meat quality is like Papa Murphys take home pizza. It could be better but for the price it is not bad. I mean you are paying 8$ for unlimited they are not going to stock proccuito. 

Overall I like these guys. Do youraelf a favor and eat it at the restaurant. If you get it to go it is thin crust and any further than 5 minutes it woll loose it's heat. I take it to go and throw on my seat warner but it still looses some heat. I am ok with this"}
{"text":"Amazing and awesome pizza. Love being able to pick any toppings. Definitely will b going back a lot!! Had whole wheat crust and it was sooo good!"}
{"text":"I read somewhere here that this place is the Subway of pizza and they're right. So yeah, it's good for what it is and yeah, the kids love it. I'd rather eat the pizza here than Little Caesars, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza.  Fresh, really good and perfect for a lunch.  Staff was very nice and helpful.  I gave it only 4 stars because the music was so loud you could not talk.  We had a party of 5 and had a difficult time hearing what each other said."}
{"text":"Shorthanded or this the way they operate?  Only 3 people working, alternating between cashiering, making pizza, cleaning tables, etc.  If Pieology is a franchise, then whoever owns this one needs to go look at Downtown Summerlin to see how a good place is run.  In a nutshell:  Rustic Veggie Pizza on menu supposed to be whole wheat crust, this place claims they no longer carry it.  Strike 1. BBQ chicken pizza without BBQ sauce? Was told it would be on the pizza, they bring it, and it's not.  I ask where is the sauce, they say you didn't ask for it!  BBQ chicken pizza with no BBQ on it.  Strike two.  Bathrooms filthy and men's room door does not lock.  Strike 3.  You're out.  And the pizza here was not that good.  Go to Downtown Summerlin, it's a thousand times better there, and they know what they are doing."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! If you do not like this place you are either too picky or built your pizza wrong yourself. You just cannot beat the bang for the buck. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to get custom pizza without breaking the bank.  Clean place, friendly staff. Overall great first experience here. #winfreepieologypizza"}
{"text":"My wife and I went in to the W Chandler Blvd location on a late Tuesday afternoon and there wasn't hardly anyone there except us. My wife had been to one In San Jose, Ca about a year ago and loved it. Since I hadn't I figured I try it out. I had a fairly loaded pie on wheat crust while the wife had her two meat with lots of pineapple on reg crust. I was impressed with the fresh selection of toppings( missing was Roma tomatoes and anchovies if you like them..I don't really). The crusts are formed on a pretty cool looking press from fresh dough made earlier. Thus only affords one thickness of crust that is a thin type. After a 15 min bake time in their fired oven our pies were ready. Mine was very good, probably one of the best thin style pizzas I've had here in the desert valley. Crust was perfectly crisp around edges and not soggy in middle with all the toppings I had on it. Again a great pizza and experience overall. David came by and made sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"This style of eating is one of my favorites.  Fresh ingredients ready to be topped on your own personal size pizza. They have all sorts of different sauces and cheeses as well. Did i mention UNLIMITED everything ?!? 

The only thing I could say that could've been better was that I would've liked a crispier crust."}
{"text":"This is a new location near my work. All I have to say it's WOW. They have the best PIZZA in town. I tried many others but nothing compare to the this location. 
Friendly service, plenty of toppings and no charge for extra!!!!!!
Bye bye MID, hello Pieology."}
{"text":"We went to Pieoligy because they were training their staff and were offering a free  pizza if we dined in. Pizza and free will get anyone's attention! Needless to say it was very busy, but when it was our turn to order we were greeted with smiles and a whole lot of enthusiasm! Trainers and trainees work fast and were very friendly! The pizza was great and the atmosphere was awesome! We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the coolest! It's a make your own pizza place set up like subway or chipotle, with everything behind the counter and you just pick what you want. The pizzas are the perfect size for one or two people (I had a few pieces for lunch and a few leftover for dinner!). The employees are super friendly and helpful. The selection of meats and toppings is great, and you can put as many as you want on your pizza for one price! 10/10 will go again!"}
{"text":"I love the concept ! Definitely reminds me of chipotle of pizza! It is a great price for all toppings on a personal pizza . I got the pesto sauce and marinara . Yummmm with chicken !! The ingredients are fresh and so many to choose from. Customer service was wonderful and many nice workers that answered all my questions :) I took one star off because the crust ! There is only on type of crust here ! It is too thin!!!! I would come back if I need a quick pizza meal."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and we were not disappointed. They have so many delicious toppings to choose from and cook the pizzas to perfection. The cheesy garlic bread was also unbelievably delicious. The prices were reasonable and the staff were all beyond friendly. The only thing I wish they did differently was offering different sizes for the individual pizzas and the garlic bread, because it was all too much of a good thing! We have recommended to family and will be back ourselves!"}
{"text":"Pieology's concept is wonderful it is what attracted me to this location in the first place. Customize your pizza with the choice of gluten free, wheat or original crust, and unlimited options with luxury items like: artichoke, sundried tomatoes, grilled chicken, Alfredo sauce, etc. Heck yeah, not to mention the price is amazing. I was very surprised by the quantity of options I could choose from with zero extra cost from ANYTHING (unlike everywhere else where certain options charge extra). The atmosphere is very inviting with upbeat music. I enjoyed the seat yourself long table dining experience. This location appeals to all sorts of people, the diversity of the people, music and pizza options made my time out with my family fun and enjoyable. I would recommend this place to everyone I know, in fact  I already have."}
{"text":"Finally! A pizza place where you can customize your own pi - oh wait . . . haven't we already seen this before?

In all honesty, I guess there's really nothing wrong with Pieology. It blends in nicely amongst all of the other clichéd \"fast casual\" pizzerias that are about as played out as TV talent shows. But is that really a good thing?

What's especially weird about dining at Pieology, or at least this particular location, is that it's located directly across the street from Blaze. You can actually see it while sitting down, which makes this location less than ideal.

My girlfriend and I ordered a couple of pizzas. A standard pepperoni for me, while hers included a combination of meat. They do have a high-rise crust option, but the standard serving comes with the extremely flat and slightly crunchy crust that seem to be a staple of all of these joints.

In the end, I wouldn't necessarily say it was bad - I mean, I'll eat pizza any given day of the week. It's just not something that particularly stands out at anything special, especially when you can get something similar (and slightly better) just across the street.

We ate here on a Sunday afternoon and the place was completely dead - meaning that we were the only ones there. We watched multiple families pull into the parking lot, only to go to the Panda Express next door. Hell, even the manager went over for some Panda grub!

Maybe if this were a decade ago, I'd be singing more praises. But in present day, in a city that's completely oversaturated with these types of places, I just don't see Pieology as anything special.

Sorry!"}
{"text":"Neat little spot.  We were looking for pizza and found this place.    Pizza's were bigger than I expected so we ended up splitting one.  Price was reasonable and the food came out super fast.  It wasn't so hot we burned our mouths either.  Liked it a lot!"}
{"text":"Employees do not seem happy to be there and now when we ask for extra cheese they give us an attitude, I thought it was unlimited toppings? We don't frequent this place as much as we used to because of this."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this is the pizza place that I've been waiting for.  First, it's an 12\" super thin, crispy crust.  Perfect for one person.  Second, unlimited toppings for one price - $8.  Yes, $8, and you can have all the toppings that you want, from a list of 40 choices.  In other words, no matter what you do, your pizza can never cost more than $8 (unless you get gluten free, but I don't).  Third, it cooks fast, really fast.  So nothing against Spinatos, Florencia, Belle Italia - they are all truly great, and I will miss them.  But pizza this tasty for $8 wins.  My wife and I can now have 2 completely different 12\" pies $16.  My days of dropping $25 for a pizza, and paying $2/topping are over!"}
{"text":"Every experience I have had here has been a good one! If you want pizza made right then this is your place! Delicious and a lot of great options."}
{"text":"I have crazy allergies and this is pretty much the only place I can eat at. I've tried Blaze Pizza as well but Pieology really goes the extra mile. I get a gluten free pizza and it's prepared well and tastes great. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that they constantly have new people working there. Everyone cooks the pizza a little different. The only people who cook consistently alike are the managers. The managers rotate my gluten free pizza in the oven so it can be perfectly cooked all around and have a crispy bottom to the dough. 

I buy a pizza here at least once a week from the North Las Vegas location. They are super friendly and awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my first time WOW  people are friendly cost for medium size pizza with any kind of crust any kind of toppings unlimited is $8.63 I can only eat two slices delicious taste homemade everything fresh I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had seen the name but never tried it until yesterday. I'm already back for round 2. That's how good it is for the price. If you like pizza with fresh ingredients and and a thin or thick crusty crust. This is definitely the place to be. Highly recommended for anybody on a budget with a big appetite. 
You basically build your own pizza, one size, 2 thicknesses, any ingredient (incl. in price), tons of choices of meats (incl. in price). 8-9$ total. Just too good to be true. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I have to say.. I like this place. It was mid day and had the \"hangry's\" as they say. Wasn't in the mood for a pizza , but a friend suggested getting a thin crust without sauce and no cheese. We put lots of topping on and had them slather it in their \"oil concoction\".  Ok.. is this going to be super bland? The gentleman behind the counter suggested topping it with red pepper flakes at the end to bring out more of the spice. Well...
This was delicious. Perfectly crunchy crust with hot flavors complimented by the oil and the natural oils of the different peppers . Sweetness from the pineapple melted into the mushrooms and the spinach, and the onions just added that .. well you know.. onion flavor. 
Perfectly satisfied , hit the spot, without gorging, midday thing! I am hooked!"}
{"text":"An acoustic nightmare. If you're ears are not ringing they will be.  All hard surfaces make it a giant echo chamber.  The pizza was good and a good deal for $11 with a drink.  Service was good.  Poor cell service in this area and no wifi here while other establishments like Five Guys next door have wifi."}
{"text":"Super fun! I love the idea of making my own pizza and getting it back super fast. My daughter loved being able to watch them make it. We did the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was spicy! Totally plan on going back!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Wednesday night after a busy day at work. There were about 10 people eating in and no one in line. They brought our pizzas to our table about 8 minutes after we ordered them. They were very good. I ordered the Buffalo chicken pizza. The flavor was good, especially if you are craving the chicken wings. It was spicier than I had expected and would describe it as medium heat versus a mild heat. That was good because it slowed me down from trying to inhale the whole pizza. The tables were clean and the soda machine was to the side for refills. Upon leaving I used the restroom and it was a single use restroom vs a stall system. It was clean as well. Definitely a good value as I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"I have no idea what's happened to this place recently but I will never come back!!! They have a huge attitude about measuring everything they put on your pizza and then if you ask for more sauce or cheese they cop an attitude and tell you it's not unlimited items! No dah! Just give me something on the pizza and stop being so greedy and micro managing the pizza! Very poor customer service!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Pieology,one of  employee, Melina was being super friendly and helpful in delivering my pizzas as well as answering my questions! The pizzas themselves were pretty great and so was the environment"}
{"text":"First time here! I loved the build your own pizza and the crust is thin and crunchy. The cheese is gooey and stringy like a pizza should have. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"The custom pizzas are awesome especially with the garlic butter!! Great customer service especially Joshua in his awesome mustard colored pants which ad a pop of color to his uniform which matches his spunky personality. We love Pieology!!!"}
{"text":"I mean it's not the most amazing pizza I've ever eaten but you can't beat the quality at their price point.  It's defiantly a great lunch option, cheap, quick and flavorful. This location like the others I've been to has a great atmosphere, that is kept clean and tidy by the very friendly well trained staff.
I highly recommend and I'll be back many times in the future myself."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to pizza place. You get your choice of crust, sauce and all the toppings that you could want for $8. Well, except for anchovies, but that's only the minorest of gripes. The toppings are fresh, even if the sausage is pretty much \"sausage crumbles\", it's still tasty. And it takes all of 5 minutes to bake your pizza. It's not fancy artesan pizza, nor do they claim to be. It's all about customization. The pizza is your creation, what YOU want on a pizza. Want a pizza with gorgonzola, feta and pineapple? Well, there you go. Want a barbeque chickpea and olive pizza? It's yours.

The staff is also great. Tons of help as you walk through your order. The girl who helped me last time was Sabrina. She was great! She just kept piling on toppings!

I didn't even mention their salads. They are $8.99, but they are size of a basketball (well, half a basketball). If you get a salad and a pizza, its enough for 3 people! You can get any and all of the same pizza toppings on the salad. I recommend the raspberry vinaigrette.

All in all, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The Hype IS Real. This place is great. Pricey but worth it. Make it your way and in 5 min it will be experiencing greatness."}
{"text":"You can keep your sign up to receive our specials BS.  Thank god I stood in line for 20 minutes to pay full price because I didn't give up my personal info to take advantage of a special. Fired Pie will get my money from here on out."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Friendly staff! Always clean! Custom pizzas, any toppings you want or you can pick one of their signature pizzas. Try one of the new cheesy breads! Absolutely yummy!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious pizza and salads!  I shared the smokin' buffalo chicken pizza and the cesar salad..yummy!   You can also build your own pizza, which I want to try next!  Friendly and fast service!  Reasonably priced too.  Great for a quick lunch or dinner.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I find it quite hilarious to rate this place any lower than a 5 stars. If you rate it low, you must be a terrible chef! You're responsible for your creation. This place provides you with all the right ingredient for a great pizza. Let me give you my winning recipe. Regular dough, garlic olive oil spread and traditional marinara, mozzarella, bacon, red onions, spinach and pepperoni. Cooked fresh and priced right, how can you really complain?"}
{"text":"What a cool place! I had the Margherita pizza which was spot on. My friend had a pepperoni and pineapple with Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses on a wheat crust. Hers was ok, but we both liked mine better. Will try a couple different ones next time we are there! $8 for a pizza-great deal!"}
{"text":"Today was 4 stars instead of 5 because of the red shirt.  He told a worker to \"watch your cheese\" and when we told him we wanted after cooking toppings,  he, the red shirt, asked us to wait by the register since he didn't know how to do it. Um, you're the red shirt, don't you know how to add it?  I'm only this bold because I can see my food being made. On the flip side,  Jes remembered us and chatted with us while assembling or pies.  Jes is cool.  Already  a staple for us here.  Hi, Jes!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it was some sick joke but we ordered two vegan pizzas and there was rotting class 1 carcinogens(pepperoni)all over one pizza. Why would we pay more for vegan cheese to have no cancer and cholesterol if we wanted part of a dead animal on it? Vegans and vegetarians beware. I'm never ordering again."}
{"text":"Solid pizza that's cooked up in like seconds- crust is right and a bit of olive oil keeps it crispy-
Made fresh every time right in front of you
Veggies are Free!
Mad to meat you is a staple here- and the pepperoni curls up so you know it's real- 
First few times here I read the wall of inspiration and shared some of the quotes with friends-
Love the fact that is ridiculously fast and well priced!
This place is a regular stomping ground now"}
{"text":"I came here for Pi Day for the first time and had a great experience. It was super busy but the customer service was still excellent. I love the concept and the amount of topping they put on is pretty fair. I'm definitely coming back here again with my family. Cannot wait to create another pie! :)"}
{"text":"The place itself is really cool, full of positive words and advices on the wall that leads you to their counter, it is a clean and organized restaurant. They have plenty of options to choose from and their price is fair, combo here is worth it! 
However, the one thing you need to be aware of is they offer you the possibility of building your own pizza but according with their portions of each ingredient. This means that if you're like me and love extra cheese or extra anything on your pizza, you will have a hard time here as they have their measurements and won't give you a little extra this or that.
Aside from that they pizza tastes delicious."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite, and it was cheap compared to all the other places we ate at in Vegas. Fast and friendly service. This place is the best, you can pick your own toppings and how you want it done, or they have some menu items you can choose from. One pizza was good enough for my husband and I. But if you're really hungry, you can eat one by yourself and have a couple of slices left over. Fun and cute place. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I came here on my Birthday and We came upon this place because we stayed at MGM, they have a free pizza on your birthday but you have to sign up for it, however the person in the cashier decided to give me a discount only because it was my birthday.  We were seating far from the cashier when this Filipino Guy yelled out and said we did not pay for our food in front we of everybody instead of calling us. Me and my husband told him we paid and the other guy decided to give a discount!! But this asshole said NO we need to sign up! Okay we get it!!!  But don't say we did not pay for our food out loud embarrassing my whole family.  It was a $14 dollars difference from what we paid!! MY POINT IS THE VALUE ON HOW YOU TREAT YOUR CUSTOMER!!!  That filipino guy is sick rude from the beginning!!! I am so dissatisfied disappointed!! This guy is rude!!!! Rude!!  Rude!!!"}
{"text":"wow!....... where do i begin, 

the date of my visit was 8/20/17 around 7pm 

i've been to pieology a few times before this visit but this experience made me sure that i won't be back again. 

as i entered the building no one said anything or noticed that i was there, i stood in front of the glass where you order your pizza and finally a lady came up who i think was a manager. i thought finally i can order my pizza but she just kinda stood there staring at me until i asked her if she was ready, she wasn't even trying to take my order witch makes for a really awkward experience, i told her my order then she proceeded to take the order of the people behind me and all she would say to them was \"sauce?.... sauce?....\" so weird no hello or \"what can i get for you?\"

i went to pay for my pizza and it was the same deal with the dude at the register he just stared at you until you say something super weird lookin dude with bleach stains in his shirt 

 so my pizza took a super long time to come out and when i finally got it it came all weird and not full, you would think with that big metal thing they use to smash down the dough it would come out to be a perfect circle but nope they just don't care enough i guess also when i asked for ranch the dude came over with it and it had no lid and he had bare hand with ranch on them soooooo nasty"}
{"text":"We had lunch at the Pieology by Downtown Summerlin. It was almost identical to Blaze Pizza. The only thing different was the decor. The pizza was good as was our salad. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Horrible and filthy location to get a pizza or salad.
My wife ordered for salad yesterday and she found cockroach in the salad.Be careful before getting a salad here.."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today and loved it. I ordered the gluten free spicy buffalo chicken pizza and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the gluten free crust was. The crust was nice and crisp as opposed to a lot of gluten free crusts which are soggy-not this one! The buffalo chicken pie was an excellent choice. Full of flavor and just enough spice. My daughter created her own and was equally happy with her pizza. The staff was very cheerful and  patient while we figured out what we wanted.  The place has a nice vibe and we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say that this place just didn't do it for me.  I have tried it twice and both time it was not up to my standards.  There really isn't any crust on their pizzas. They seem to put olive oil, butter or other greasy crap on the crust.  Good luck eating here."}
{"text":"Went to this location opening day. Pizza is outstanding. Had a classic salad as well which was fantastic. All the pizza is made with fresh ingredients and fresh salad. Hello I have dessert pizza as well. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"i've been to pieology a couple times before but this was just awful. none of our pizzas were cut, but everyone else around us had their pizzas cut. they got 2/3 pizzas wrong and the third just didn't taste good. super disappointed"}
{"text":"Chipotle meets gourmet pizza! My family and I visited here and I must say I was impressed. Their you build it concept is very easy to manage. I had the original crust with house red sauce, extra mozzarella and Parmesan cheese topped with pepperoni, Canadian bacon, bacon, and spicy Italian sausage. Sprinkled with oregano and crushed red pepper. 

The crust was perfect blend of crunch and chewiness. Sauce was delish along with the toppings. I must mention the all the toppings are included in the price which makes it a bargain. Restaurant was clean and well laid out. Standard soda fair takes the hours of decision making out of the process, unlike those behemoth machines. Bottom line, good price point, excellent quality, and friendly service makes a return visit a no brainer."}
{"text":"we went to the one in Downtown Summerlin.  What can I say, for $7.95 and unlimited toppings, it was AWESOME!!!  
We got sausage (tasted a little funny but was okay, I wouldn't get again), tomatoes, mushrooms, green peppers, pepperoni and olives.  The crust was thin and very light.  LOVED IT.  Service was okay.  Fast.  The reason for 4 stars and not 5 was because of 2 things.  We were not greeted when we walked in.  There was only 1 person ahead of us.  And secondly, when I asked for a little extra cheese, the young woman looked at me as if I asked for a million dollars, rolled her eyes and put probably about 7 shreds of cheese onto my pie.  Bad day I guess.  Will I go back?  Absolutely!  And I must say it's something that needs to be eaten hot and fresh.  We had 2 pieces left over and when reheated, it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Pass. Not worth it in my opinion.  I'm by far no pizza snob. I'll do a little Caesars any day. Price wise not bad, but you can get a full size large now a days at most places for equal or slightly more. The sauce was very thin and watery. Very bad combo with such a thin pizza. It became too floppy and a little mushy. Mine was burnt around the edges. I wouldn't even recommend this as a quick lunch spot during work. Like I said, the sauce is watery and it dripped on my shirt,  luckily it's a Saturday,  I'm still at work, but hardly anyone here. And the only good thing about the watery sauce is that it wiped off my shirt easily, and it's a black shirt so no one can tell. Bottom line, if you are out of work,  pass and get a real pizza, or if you ARE at work, still pass, it's messy to eat, high risk of spillage on your work shirt, and leaves your hands very greasy."}
{"text":"When you walk in EVERYONE screams \"WELCOME 2 PIEOLOGY!\"  then gives you a bite of a free pizza. Ok, no free pizza bite, but you are greeted well. I even got help by an employee who was in process of going home which really led me to review them. 5 star job guys, keep up the good work, and wear name tags so I can drop name bombs the next time. Great pizza, lemonade and atmosphere..."}
{"text":"This was my first (and only as of now) experience with one of the make your own pizza places. I must say that I am a fan of the concept. I cant judge this place against other places, but I really enjoyed my 'za. I got pesto with mozzarella+gorgonzola cheese, chicken, bacon, olives, artichoke hearts, and fresh basil. Im sure my breath could kill a man afterwards, but it was worth it. My wife got pepperoni. I like this option as I don't have to compromise what I like when getting pizza. Ive had better pizza at many other places, but this place gets points for the concept."}
{"text":"I just want to preface my review as an honest reviewer, not just in it for the freebies with a 5 star review. I'm really happy they opened this location since I work right down the street and the north side is always in need of new restaurant options. The line tends to get a bit long at lunch time, but it goes by quickly.

The most recent time I came with some coworkers I had a create your own salad. The overall quality and size was good of the salad was good. I just wish they had a bit more salad options like different meats, more veggies or noodles. The pizzas have been good in the past, but this most recent visit both of my coworkers' pizzas turned out overly soggy and wet.

I would come back again, but I really wish they wouldn't encourage false positive reviews. Just let  your food and service speak for itself."}
{"text":"We took friends who like thin crust pizza to Pieology.  It was a success.  Everyone created their own personal pizzas and most of us took advantage of the drinks.  The Mango Mango Lemonade was amazing and all of us would have it again.  Everyone was also quite happy with their pizzas and would come again."}
{"text":"I LOVE the pizza but the employees and management are the real reason I come back. They know my order and make sure to personalize my experience each time and not just by my pizza. They have excellent customer service and welcome everyone with a smile. I would give them more than 5 stars but that's not an option."}
{"text":"For now, open just over a month, this place is still working out the kinks. On a busy Saturday night, all four of our pizzas were way undercooked. They looked OK and the toppings were good, but the crust was soggy and chewy. Also, they don't have their liquor license yet."}
{"text":"Wow! what can i say  quite the let down
i had high hopes but was sadly let down.....
i should have seen the writing on the wall when i arrived at lunchtime expecting a wait   but there was only 1 other couple sitting in the whole place..first off let me say this:
 the staff was very nice and helpful...
the good :
nice decor nice staff
the Bad:the pizza is awful......
the crust is the same type of quality as a totino's frozen pizza crust. cracker thin and hard as a rock and tasteless.
the toppings are not artisan quality!!!!  more like you see in any delivery place in the country .
bottom line:
waste of time and money
if you want artisan quality pizza drive the extra 30 seconds and go to 
Pizinis"}
{"text":"Pieology Pizza been here several times an I always love it great pizza, price, nice atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Paper thin pizza's and a bit overpriced. Tried once won't go back. Their concept is good but not my style."}
{"text":"This restaurant has it together. Following a similar model to Chipotle, I waited in line and had my pizza assembled in front of my eyes. I had a choice to get one of their standard recipes or trust my gut. Not much gets past my gut, so I built my own pizza from scratch:  herb butter and red sauce, mozzerellaa and Parmesan, sausage, pepperoni, bacon, olives artichokes and other delicious toppings. 

So within less than five minutes of paying and sitting at my table. The pizza was delivered hot and fresh. The crust was crisp and the toppings were cooked through and delicious. The pizza was about $8 and could probably feed two. Gluten free and whole wheat crusts are available as well as salads."}
{"text":"I love Pieology and the unlimited toppings! The service and quality of pizza is excellent and it's a great way to personalize your pizza! Pretty much all the toppings you'd want on your pizza are here and it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great pizza $13 for personal pizza with drink $17 kind of pricey. Ordered the fire grilled bbq and it was good and at Vegas casino prices."}
{"text":"It's nice to see that other customers enjoyed their experience here, but I'd have to say mine was no more than average. A 3.5 stars out of 5 at most.

After the closing of Custom Built, my SO and I heard that Pieology was similar in concept-- a build your own pizza type of establishment, and we were excited to check it out. 

The restaurant is bright with plenty of natural light. This is something I take note of in any restaurant. The decor was industrial and comparable to Chipotle's. It was before noon on a weekday, and, luckily, we had gotten there at a decent time; there was plenty of open seating.

Although we understood the concept of the establishment and it's customizable pizzas, I was disappointed to find that the young lady behind the counter who walked over to us gave little to no greeting. In her hands, she held their regular dough and simply asked us what we wanted. We had never been there before and so we asked a few questions about the dough options. They were answered straightforwardly, and no other information was exchanged. Our pizza was topped and slid into the oven. A different employee came over to the register and charged us accordingly. He then  mentioned that our pizza would be brought over to us shortly.

When it arrived, I was happy to find that it was good pizza, and that the person who brought it over was nice and wiped all the surrounding tables. Clean. I'd also like to note that our pizza was not burnt like it had been described in other reviews--it was crisp, light and my SO liked the pizza's sauce. For the price, around $7-$8, I'd eat it again.

My only gripe with this place was the lack of good customer service. It wasn't unpleasant per sè, but it certainly didn't make for an ideal lunch out. A smile, a \"have a great day\" or an \"enjoy your meal\" would have been nice.

I'd say that the best phrase for me to describe Pieology would be \"not bad\". Stop by for a quick lunch or afternoon bite! It's inexpensive and has something for everyone. There are tables with sufficient seating for larger groups. Bring your friends!"}
{"text":"After a lot of hype and recommendations from friends I headed to Pieology. 
I think that when one walks into a business a smile from the person behind the counter would be nice and/or expected. Instead this young lady seemed annoyed that a customer had walked in. Being in the service industry myself I can understand that everyone has a bad day every now and then, but you have to be a little more friendly, even at a place like this one. 
So I ordered their \"Mad to Meat You\" pie, and maybe it was because I asked about the ingredients of their toppings, but I got home and opened the box to find what looked like a meatball(??) pizza. It was below average at best. I didn't have time to go back to the location and express my concern, nor would I had after tasting this pie. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I wasn't expecting a cardboard-tasting crust with bland sauce, flavorless cheese, and none of the toppings I had ordered. Very disappointing. 
If you're looking for a cheap, quick pizza then this might be the place for you. But there are way too many pizza joints offering way better pies in this city for you to waste your time and money in this place."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews until I've tried a place a few times, but OH MY GOODNESS this place was amazing!! The pizza was cooked JUST right, and I love the whole 'like subway, but with pizza'. This was the first time my boyfriend and I were able to eat pizza together and enjoy it lol (we can never decide what to get if we have to share). But, I digress, back to the pizza: I had bbq sauce, spicy chicken, roasted red peppers, feta cheese and mozzarella. Boyfriend had pepperoni, jalapeños, spicy chicken, mozzarella, red sauce, and three cheese sauce. Both cooked to perfection. Right amount of char. Thin crust was tasty and had a slight crunch upon the first and subsequent bites. Bruhhhhh, GO EAT HERE. RIGHT NOW. I DON'T EVEN CARE IF YOU HAVE ALREADY EATEN, JUST STARTED TO EAT, OR CURRENTLY AT A RESTAURANT (WALK OUT) & RUN HERE."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for a personal pizza! The space is huge and well ventilated (Maybe a little too much so since it was a bit chilly in there but I will take slightly chilly over super warm!). I browsed through the menu before deciding on the rustic veggie pizza. The Yelp check-in offer was for a free fountain soda- nice! The grand total was $7.95 pre-tax for my pie, about the same you'd pay at similar personal custom pizza places.

The pizza came out in a few minutes, delivered right to my table. It had a plentiful amount of vegetables such as red and green bell peppers, corn, onion, and aromatics such as garlic and fresh basil. There was a thin layer of tomato sauce and it was topped with mozzarella and ricotta. 

Overall, it was a pretty good pie. The sauce wasn't overpowering and was well balanced against the other ingredients. I liked the thin crispy crust which had a slight amount of chewy give when you bit into it. The vegetables were cooked yet still retained their crispness, to contrast with the creamy texture and slight salinity of the cheese. I would have liked a little more fresh basil on the pizza though, and in larger pieces. 

Out of all the quickie personal pizza places in the Phoenix area this is one of my favorites so far!"}
{"text":"Fantastic staff, all friendly, patient, hardworking and helpful. It's the little things that showed us they were considerate of their customers. For example, mentioning to us that the Margherita pizza didn't come with sauce and asking if we wanted to add sauce onto it, answering all our questions, and they all make sure to welcome and also say goodbye to the customers. They also set out takeout containers by the soda machine where you can easily get them if you need to take some leftovers home.
This is the Chipotle of pizzas. I personally love how they used minced garlic instead of cloves. They also had some less common pizza ingredients (like artichoke) that some may enjoy. Because it's a thin crust pizza, it cooks quite fast. The inside of the restaurant felt really clean and new. Definitely a great spot if you want something different."}
{"text":"I went to Pieology with a friend after a long day.  We had never been there before, but decided to go with a menu item instead of a make-your-own.  I appreciate the different kinds of crusts - we went with the thin.

At the check-out it gets a little confusing.  They don't communicate with each other - the cashier asked us what we ordered, but then charged us for two instead of one pizza (we were sharing).  Also, they have wine on the menu board, but don't actually sell wine.  After paying, it's unclear if you're supposed to wait or if someone will bring it to you, so we ended up hovering by the cashier until the pizza was ready. 

The pizza itself was good, nothing special, but hit the spot.  I really wanted to try the churro dessert pizza, but after seeing the calorie count, we couldn't justify it.

We'd go back for a quick dinner, and maybe do a build-your-own next time!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My mother-in-law recommended this place and I hesitated once she dropped the \"thin crust\" bomb. Thin crust haters, I promise you you will not feel jibbed or have an uncomfortable crunch. Their pizzas are thin enough to be thin crust, but spongey enough to feel satisfied. Think of this place as the subway of pizzas. You can select from their menu the pizza you'd like, or you can customize your order how you'd like. Fresh and flavorful pizza... And they're extremely fast."}
{"text":"I came in one night 10 minutes before they closed (I didn't want to be \"that\" customer but I was craving their pizza) and the ladies took my order and made my pizza without any hesitation or attitude. I love all of their pizzas and the fact that they have great customer service makes me want to keep coming back even more! Keep it up Pieology!"}
{"text":"This was legitimately the worst pizza I have ever had, and I've had lots of pizza. The crust was super thin, soggy, and limp. The bottom was burned, and the top was pasty white, like it had barely experienced the oven. It was bland and tasteless. It had 'sausage' on it, but I've never seen sausage that color before. Really really bad. Never again. I opened the box and thought 'this has to be a joke'. No idea how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Best Pizza ever!!! Seriously, this is my favorite pizza of all time. I order: herb butter, pesto, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, roasted red pepper, olives, basil, garlic, artichoke, Canadian bacon, pepperoni, oregano, crushed red pepper and another round of Parmesan cheese at the end."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend until this place figures out how to make pizza. 
1) way too much cheese 
2) completely undercooked"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out and was a little disappointed after getting our order. 
the sauce had no more flavor than the $1.00 can of hunts spaghetti sauce you can buy in the store.  
I had a ham and pineapple pizza and it was bland sadly.
my crust was a little too burnt and had the joy of tasting that as well.
I will say it was inexpensive but that may be went I had the experience I got. the ingredients were fresh looking, so that was a plus.  
I'm not planning on coming anytime soon. again it's not horriblr. I was hopping for something more like a pizzeria I guess. gourmet style. this is not the place :)"}
{"text":"Second visit and not impressed. Barely any sauce and toppings are meager, at best. Asked for mushrooms and she put, like, 5 pieces all on one side of the pizza. Wish \"Blaze Pizza\" had a location on this side of town. Pieology would be out of business."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times since it's opened and today I had my worst pizza! It was burnt! I didn't have time to make a deal about it because I was already running late to work. They were already running behind schedule I know but no excuse to burn a pizza! I'd rather be late to work with a good pizza instead of a burnt one. I did eat part of my pizza but It became too much after a few slices so i had to get rid of it! :("}
{"text":"I have never been to a Pieology before, I was surprised how dirty it was for a new place to be honest.  I think they just opened??

The tables were all gross and so was the pie station.  I totally cannot believe this is a new place, maybe they got used equipment? IDK. 

For an $8 pizza they hardly give you any cheese at all and you really have to be quick to tell them if you want more toppings because they are throwing that pizza down the line as fast as possible (I suspect so you won't add more toppings)..

The pizza itself was not terrible, it was pizza.  

The red sauce is good.  

The butter and garlic is not a bit overpowering but that could just be because of the lack of toppings they give you?  Perhaps if it had more toppings it would taste better??  

I just think that the toppings are very minimal for an $8 personal pan pizza and although the website says you can get as much as you want, the way its done says the opposite.  

***** Be fast, be bold if you want more toppings!!  Don't let them bully you!

I think what disgusted me the most and what prompted me to come here and review this place was the way the place is run.

There are a lot of young kids from our town working there and being talked to poorly by the manager.  

He was so rude to the girl at the register and I could tell she was new and doing the best she could.

I kept giving him a look, like \"hey dude, I'm watching you\" but I could tell he didn't care.  It makes me sad because of the age of the employee. 

I can get over the pizza not having enough toppings, I can understand things get a little messy sometimes when it's busy BUT the management needs to change.

Dirty restaurant and mistreated employees = bad management.

If you go here, fight for your toppings and tell the employees that do a good job, they are doing a good job because I suspect they don't hear it often from their supervisor."}
{"text":"I dont know how this place got a good reviews but i would give it a one star!!! Long line with one person making pizzas, and limited topings is a big NO NO!! Not coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"Ok...so this place is basically the Chipotle of pizza.  (By the way, I also love Chipotle.)  

Want wheat crust? You got it. Prefer white crust? Okey dokey!  Don't like pepperoni? No problem!  Don't feel like picking toppings? Great - we have some suggested combinations for you!

Couple notes: 
The buffalo sauce is actually quite spicy! 
The BBQ chicken pizza is pretty legit, and I don't even like BBQ sauce.
For a chain place, the crust is actually good!
You can't customize salads at this location (lame). 
The pre-made salads are not great.
For the price and the quality, this place is a great deal.

Bottom line: if you like customizing things and you like pizza, come here.  If someone you're with doesn't like pizza, send them next door to Five Guys.  But seriously, who doesn't like pizza? That person is a monster - unfriend them."}
{"text":"My son has dairy and soy allergies so it is hard to find a place to eat. PIEOLOGY was able to cater to both...gluten free had no soy and they use a vegan cheese with no soy and dairy."}
{"text":"Outside withing for then to open. According to Management they open at work 11am. It's 11:08 , it's cold outside New Years Eve 2015. They still have not opened door."}
{"text":"Super clean place....super great service (so friendly and attentive) and let's not forget that the pizza was amazing! (Way better than blaze pizza)"}
{"text":"Pieology on Greenfield Rd in Mesa not only made us an awesome pizza but they fulfilled our online request to \"put a picture of Spider-Man on the box\".  Thanks Avery you're awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sure everyone's already said this but I'm just gonna reaffirm (that's a word, right?) everyone that yes, pieology is indeed like chipotle for pizzas! 

I've never seen this location busy so it's always clean & the workers are pretty attentive & welcoming. 

I wanna say this place is healthy since you control what you put into it! You can't really go wrong with the ingredients here."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!!! Lots of different options for crust, cheese, and veggies!!! Only meat options--- no they vegetarian or vegan protein options. Maybe in the future?? Still really delicious! Friendly workers as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing make to order pizza!  I would recommend  getting the extra rise crust! You can add all the topping you want."}
{"text":"I love this place! I can make a pizza with the toppings I want. A little of this, some of that, no, not that. It's a great value for a great pizza cooked in their brick oven.

Consider yourself blessed if Emily is making your particular pizza. She will create a masterpiece for you.

Thank you Emily! 5 stars for you!

That was delicious."}
{"text":"First I wanted to come try because it is a new business and I'm a new business owner and I know how the owner must have feel. I'm not disappoint! I love Blaze Pizza but k have to say this place is better in my opinion. I love their dough better."}
{"text":"This is my first time purchasing from Pieology. I was extraordinarily surprise. I loved that you could order online and choose your toppings. I was pleasantly surprised that when we picked up our salads and pizzas, they were not skimpy with the toppings. The food was wonderful."}
{"text":"Going for a show and this stopped was perfect!!!!! We had half half and their thin crust is fast and crisp delicious the amount of toppings is just enough"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for pizza. We went last night there were four of us two couples and we my husband and I shared the Alfredo artichoke pizza, cheese it had garlic on it fire roasted tomatoes and then we had some Canadian bacon put on it was great. It is very fast you order and you sit down and less than 15 minutes your pizza is there and you are enjoying the wonderful fresh taste.  Love that this place is here."}
{"text":"This place is like Sprint and an iPhone. Sprint ruins an overall good experience for the iPhone!  Great food, decent prices, but the service is much to be desired. Atypical teenage Fast Times at Ridgemont High style service. Nine customers deep and one zit face making pizza while he reads the menu . The oven man would not budge from that oven to pitch in and help make pies. The manager was busy looking important acting like the soda machine was more important than the line .  Got here at 740...it's 815 and counting . Got to Blaze Pizza. It's worth the drive and service!

Update:
820 and the manager is forced to chip in because of the growing line
823, pizza is ready. Came in a half closed box and a hurried \"sorry for the wait\". I am NEVER coming back. Not for a cup of ice, not even to take a leak!"}
{"text":"My family and I just ate here. Oh my god...we had the pepperoni pizza. IT WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD! The pepperoni was fantastic! The cheese and sauce was also very good. Surely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Loved the whole wheat crust! Pizza was yummy and delicious. The staff was very warm and welcoming too.Definitely would go there again"}
{"text":"This is my first time in Pieology. Ordered a salad. It was fresh and delicious. My friend had his made to order pizza and it was yummy. Service was the best. Very clean. Plenty of parking. I enjoyed their lemonade. Definitely will return again for my own special pizza and salad!"}
{"text":"Amazing new addition right off the strip. Everything you could want in a pizza. All your favs made to order served hot in under 10 minutes. Gluten free crust options make me super happy. They have salads for you non carb eaters as well. If you haven't  been here yet be sure to bookmark it for when you're in the area. You will not disappointed. Loving the pieology vibe!!!"}
{"text":"Went there after a long day of work - had placed my order online with the expectation to walk in the moment dinner was ready. When I walked up to the counter the guy told me it would be only a moment for my pie to be ready \"we don't put it in the oven until you show up so it's hot and fresh for you.\"  That was fine, I didn't mind waiting since he put it so nicely. I sat down and about 10 minutes later he walks up with 1/2 my order. When I told him that wasn't my whole order he asked what else I wanted. I showed him my email receipt with the rest of my online order. He said he'd fire up the other pizza. 

When I finally got my second pizza, I thought to myself \"this pizza has got to be delicious for the 40 minutes it's been since I placed my order.\" I'm sad to say my expectations were not met. The first pizza was nice and cold for us to enjoy in our hotel room less than a mile away, it was almost unappetizingly cold. The second pizza was as disappointing as the first. 

Next time I encounter a Pieology, I'll keep rolling down the road to another eating establishment."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here and everytime I come I never have any complaints bc the staff is so friendly! But today I had my pizza made by Nicole she never smiled never welcomed me in the door she even got so mad at my girlfriend and I for ordering the thick crust pizza. Her whole demeanor was so rude and I wanted to tell her something but I bit my tongue and just let her be rude to my gf and I bc she was still making my pizza don't want her to punch my pizza or mess up on purpose. But anyways she like flung the dough on the pan after I told her I wanted the thick crust and was just huffing and puffing while making the pizza and she was so angry she didn't even make the pizza that we wanted. Bc she was so pissed she didn't hear what I wanted. But anyways we confronted someone else about our pizza being wrong and they quickly got us what we wanted so that was awesome and the food is great! Homegirl could work on her attitude tho."}
{"text":"Love the idea of this place and the ability to customize your pizza with a huge variety of choices but the overall quality was mediocre.  My pizza crust was burnt on the edge.

The staff was great and the place was very clean. 

My girlfriend enjoyed the salad and the price was excellent.  We'll be back but will frequent other establishments for better pizza."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today to make my own masterpiece. For $7.95 you get to create your own pizza with unlimited toppings. 

I ordered a thin crust, red sauce, easy cheese, and literally every veggie. 

Pizza came out well. It wasn't short on flavor. I are three quarters of it and packed the rest to go for an afternoon snack. 

For the price and quality, I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I was honestly annoyed with the quality of my pizza. I come to this location all the time and this time it was disappointing. I asked the guy who made my pizza to put lots of pepperoni and he did. The girl who took my pizza out of the oven dropped so many toppings off of my pizza on to the floor, you can just see the cheese spilling out. Somehow when I open up my box I barely have any pepperonis on my pizza. For some reason they don't have spicy chicken anymore at this location. Not interested in coming back at all."}
{"text":"I always love pizza places with this type of oven-style cooking (Pizza Rev, the pizza press in Anaheim, etc). This has to be one of my favorites! 

- Great location in downtown summerlin
- large eat-in area
- fresh fountain drinks and lemonade flavors
- fresh ingredients
- they use the small pepperonis that are so cute
- friendly staff
- quick service 
- they DON'T over do it on cheese unless you specifically ask for more 

Overall 5/5 I will always come back here for my pizza fix. Keep in mind pizza places like this will take a bit of time to bake your pizza, but it is sooo worth it. Just be patient :)"}
{"text":"What is not to like about a place that makes your pizza fast and good. The service is friendly and prompt. The price is very good for a fresh made pizza. The topping choices are amazing. I love the thin crust too.

You can have any topping you want for the same price. I think it was ~$8 for 12 inch pizza. I top mine with sun dried tomatoes, double artichokes, spinach, sausage, mozzarella, bell pepper, and ham. They have other toppings like pineapple, mushroom, chicken, etc. Believe me, there are just too many toppings to list. It will be more than enough. Too much and it gets soggy. As a result, my girl likes to get her own simpler pie and I get mine drenched. I can't help it. If you can't tell, I love the Costco pizza too. Since I live near both, I can have either one. But this one is way more gourmet.

The menus are nice and big behind the cashier's like In n Out. You can see them making it in front of you. All the toppings are freshly laid out. I am terrible at choosing between options so I try to just think of toppings together and throw it in. As opposed to the girl in front of me who was deciding on toppings with her friend next to her and her bf on the phone while wearing flip-flops, pajama pants, and a jacket, because it's cold outside. So between me looking at the poor employee frowning and waiting for her to finish so she can help me and the small line behind me, I look at the ceiling with exaggerated interest, as this dotard ruminates between each topping. I imagined what Curly would do with a lemon meringue pie instead of pizza. Some people are so inconsiderate. So please, just because you can hold up the line, you don't have to exercise that option and have a phone conversation while ordering. Don't people like that just annoy you?

There is a take out menu too so you can order and pick up. You know, for those times when there's a slipper wearing Korean girl (I'm Asian so I can cry foul with impunity, and if not, well in my defense, at least I didn't go in winter wearing pajama pants and my house slippers. Now I will have to apologize to my Korean friends for bashing a fellow K girl, bah. Babo.) in front ordering on the phone with her bf and you just want your pizza pie and go. Which is exactly what I did 2 weeks later. I didn't want to oogle their ceiling again, just in case slipper girl was there again! They were even nice enough to ask how far away we lived so that they knew when to make the  pizza. Whoa, say what? We were pleasantly surprised to say the least. Now that's good service!

To satisfy a pizza craving and a quick bite to eat, I highly recommend this place. I'd give it 5 stars but I am afraid there might be something out there who deserves 5 stars and I nonchalantly have been giving everyone five stars."}
{"text":"Okay. First time here and all I gotta say is wow.
The food was fantastic but there was this guys.
David Harrington? Harrison? idk whatever. He was the manager.... He was SO RUDE.
My coworker was saying her name and he wasn't getting it so he threw his hands up like a fool and yelled \"idk just spell it\"
Like are you kidding me? THEN. That same coworker received her pizza and wanted some pesto sauce on top. And he completely ignored her and cut her off while she was talking. Also, I was trying to talk to him and he turned around and walked away give me the \"hold on\" finger. THEEEEN he got me a bag for me and my other coworkers pizza, but not the one he totally acted like a fool too.
AFTER HE ASKED IF WE WERE ALL GOING TO THE SAME PLACE.
This man needs a reality check. Like dude you work at a pizza place by CHOICE.
DO NOT treat your customers that way.
What if we were secret shoppers. YOUD BE SCREWED BUDDY.
First time there and honestly the last.
I'll find a different location."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this place and I hope that management takes the time to read some of the reviews. I am a big fan of their product and find their pizzas, when made properly, some of the best in town. Unfortunately the service and pies are so inconsistent. I've been at least four times and twice had horrible pizza. The first time, the pizza was beyond burnt because they were busy and not paying attention. The second time, they dropped the pizza as it came out of the oven and had to remake it. Not to mention, each time they've had to remake my pizza, they throw it together so fast that they skimp on the toppings and I'm left with a half ass pizza. It's too bad because it could be a great place. I wish management would take a closer look at the day to day operations. Good luck."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place I have ever been to! Under $10 to create your own pizza with unlimited toppings?! Ugh this is heaven on earth for me. The process was pretty easy. The employee asks what kind of dough you want then you just move down the line from there! You get to choose all the sauce, cheese, veggies, and meats you want! They put it in the oven while you pay. The cashier gives you a number and then they bring the pizza out to you when it's finished! The wait wasn't long at all which is also a plus! It was so delicious I actually was able to finish the whole thing. I will definitely come back a lot in the future and bring my boyfriend/friends. OH and also there is another location in Downtown Summerlin in case you didn't know!"}
{"text":"Went for the soft opening today.  Friendly service and tasty fast-casual pizza was enjoyed by all.  Glad to have another good option here in Hughes Center."}
{"text":"GOOD
My first experience here is a good one =)
The atmosphere was definitely surprising...3 tv's going on back wall, the open seating and family style table in middle.  I was gonna get it to go and head back to office but decided to stay as very inviting.  
It's the same concept as a chipotle or subway...
1. Choose a sauce.  Red,white, garlic, olive oil, etc 
2. Choose your vegetables.  Basil, peppers, sundries tomatoes, mushrooms, artichokes, pineapple, etc..
3. Choose a meat.  Chicken, meatball, pepperoni, or not if your a vegetarian.
4.  Drinks.  They have beer! and a self serve soda, tea station too

Staff were friendly and didn't rush anyone thru; as it was kinda busy.  You can really go over board with toppings or keep it simple and clean.  
There's a large oven in the center that cooks everything out in the open.  Smells AMAZING!

BAD
Only downer was that the tables and floor needed a bit of attention, but not too too much.  It was the only thing that kept me from giving a 5 star review. If you have time sit in front of tv and select iheart radio stations... then grab a towel and sweep while enjoying your jamz (cashier)....just saying.

 Sorry =( but don't forget the details.  All in All a good experience and the price point is good for the size of pizza.  The experience was pretty darn good one.  Will be back now I know the drill; may even order online for quick pick up =)"}
{"text":"I'm so glad pieology opened up . I was instantly greeted as I walked in , Mike and Gus asked how our day was going and showed us how pieology works . I think I added everything to my pizza,I've been there twice in one week.i love that they piled my pizza high with toppings   after few bites mike came over to our table  to make sure we were having a wonderful experience. The customer service is wonderful  and I will defiantly go back"}
{"text":"Like choosing my own toppings at one price!  The thin crust is my favorite--just enough for 2 people.  Glad to see a fresh pizza place open in Surprise."}
{"text":"Pretty good same concept as Fired Pie and Blaze. Nothing original here for some reason the tables are bolted to the floor. The staff were nice attentive & friendly"}
{"text":"Not enough staff. Extremely slow. Pizza was burnt, but it sat so long waiting to be cut that it was cold. From now on I will be going to Blaze Pizza"}
{"text":"I been to pizza rev and blaze. I wanted to give this place a try but it just isn't the same. The staff looked like they didnt wanted to be there. Maybe I went on a wrong day cause I know the edc kids where in town and they probably had a rough weekend, idk. The pizza was just ok."}
{"text":"My family comes in alot and I've never ordered anything so I don't know what the food is like BUT this review is off the staff. They are so friendly and start conversations so easily. Plus when I come with my family I always bring firehouse subs with me and just sit in this establishment and eat someone else's food. That might be rude but the staff is cool about it because I'm with paying customers. So props. 

One day when I try it I'll re review"}
{"text":"Pieology Pizzeria Located In Downtown Summerlin Las Vegas NV.

\"Meh ok\" says it perfectly.

Staff was friendly.

Place looked clean.

Limited staff.

A Bit Disorganized On This Visit  Nov. 30, 2017

Again,  more staff up front instead of the back would have probably helped.

Our Pizza sat up there getting cold until we reapproached  the counter asking for our pie!

Pizza was not bad, it also wasn't great either.
 
Pepperoni Pizza was bland and lacked flavor.

Salad was really good. The Spinach in my salad was fresh, candied walnuts were  delicious!! I ordered mine without the vinegertte dressing and blue cheese crumbles.

They did make my salad as I ordered, because they were practically out of that paticular salad upfront.

If I return it  probably won't be for awhile. I  think I will skip Pieology next time."}
{"text":"What's not to love? One low price, any way you want it, quick, service is polite, efficient and very welcoming! Joseph, Aleya, Judy and all the staff there are so friendly.  What a great experience! Will be coming again!!!"}
{"text":"So I have gone to Fire Pie, Mod pizza and I have to  say we lie Pieology the best. When you ask for a topping they are not stingy. Unlimited topping should mean a normal serving. So there I am having to say, \"Can I have more?\" \"More?\" Kali is super sweet and helpful. Love her customer service!!  Colin was great as well and had awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"Yea... total rip off of mod! Except they don't have multiple sizes and they didn't cut the pizza all the way through! Also wayyyy too much cheese! Pizza has no taste and the manager was chewing gum and letting her employees eat up front in front of the customers!"}
{"text":"Girls working there last night seem to be in a rush even though there wasn't anyone behind me. The girl doing the dough was moving too fast that she seem annoyed when I asked her the name of the sauces. The girl that was doing the meat wouldn't look up - she just way too concentrated on putting the meat. I don't like meat all like that so I told her 'that's enough' multiple times. Still, she didn't listen. My husband had to yell out to her to say ' that's enough' then I told her to put 1 ham- she placed multiple hams on my Pizza (ahhhhh). Now for the Pizza- it was burnt. I didn't know until I went to my hotel room and I didn't want to go all the way to the mgm for a complaint so here is my complaint!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a higher rating, but the service was so slow my daughter kept saying she was going to ask the manager how much longer. She's only 6 and I had kept her entertained for 15 minutes until she kept wondering why it took so long to receive her pizza. We decided to skip Costco's pizza line and come here and I'm sure we would've been served faster over at Costco. 

The girl who took the order was real sweet, her name was Ash. I told her to not be shy with the sauce. I also noticed they had Daiya vegan cheese, which really brought a smile to my face. I ordered the thick crust for $1 more. It wasn't that much thicker than the regular crust, but very delicious. I ordered pepperoni, chicken, spinach and pineapple. My daughter had ham and pineapple on her pizza. 

We definitely had enough left over, but I'd say we would have better luck and quicker service any other day besides Friday."}
{"text":"Great new concept.  Thin (crunchy) crust pizza in 5 mins makes for a tasty lunch during the week.  Will certainly return many more times."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! WOW!!! Build your own pizza just the way you like it, and it's ready in less than 5 minutes! Tons of toppings to choose from at a reasonable price....my tummy is very happy!"}
{"text":"It reminds me of a chipotle but pizza and not Mexican food because it's a pizza restaurant. You pick your size and then tell them what you want and they put it on, just like chipotle. I like it better than chipotle though because they've never gave anyone a bad disease"}
{"text":"Decent is the best way to describe it.   The price is good for what you get.  Service is quick and the employees were polite.   The pizza is good enough, but there is much better pizza to be had in Las Vegas.      The crust is super thin and there are plenty of ways to customize your pizza.    You almost feel like you are in Subway when you enter, but the quality is far better than Subway.    Not a place I will frequent, but no real complaints either.    Just that I am perhaps a bit of a pizza snob and if I'm going to do pizza, there are a few other places I would rather hit up."}
{"text":"Usually this place isn't bad, today it def was. Got a BBQ pizza to go....except they didn't put any bbq sauce on it ? it must have been during shift change bc the place was kind of a disaster. Kid with blonde hair @ the register clearly did not give af what was going on"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you enjoy customizing your pizza. The crusts are good and the ingredients you can put on are tasty. I like that I can choose as many ingredients as I want - all for the same price. My daughter and I can share a pizza for lunch and it satisfies us. They are a little thrifty with their sauce and cheese. I'm posting a picture of the pizza my daughter made for us today. It was a thin crust with barbecue sauce, chicken, ricotta cheese, artichoke hearts, pineapple and cilantro. They never take too long to get the pizza out to you. The people who work there are friendly."}
{"text":"As a lover of pizza, Pieology is a great concept. You get your own choice of toppings and can even get thick crust or cheese filled crusts. The dough is flattened by a machine, and you can even choose between white and red and garlic butter sauce (recommend adding this to red sauce) as well!

I believe that pizza by the slice tastes much better, but this is nice for the value."}
{"text":"This is the newest one in town, close to work so we gave it a try. My pizza came in a timely manner. It was my favorite, smoking buffalo chicken. HOWEVER, my pregnant coworker, who ordered before me, had to wait for hers....evidently it was just sitting there waiting to be delivered. Pizza was good though."}
{"text":"Yuck!  The food is just that bad. Honestly a frozen pizza from the grocery store is better and I'm not even a pizza snob.  The sauce/cheese/dough ratio is all off leaving it soggy and falling off when you try to bite. The flavor regardless of what toppings is flavorless, I guess that's the best way to describe it.  The staff was not overalls friendly either. This was my second and last time at this place."}
{"text":"Pieology was amazing you can expect immaculate service and a variety of choices and just all around greatness"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some coworkers and was pleasantly surprised. Unlimited toppings on a personal pizza is insane. The ingredients seemed fresh and the thin crust was perfect. It wasn't over cooked and too dry but still had a good crunch to it. If I could give it a 4.5, I would."}
{"text":"This place is new Clean happy on their game for sure from the manager training to the staff willing to help out with a smiling face .... as for the product hmm so awesome I had a pizza of course subtracted some things and added some too no issues so good I went back for dinner too and made a wild pizza half BBQ chicken plus custom toppings and half Alfredo pizza again - and + toppings super good the manager Tina super awesome love it .... ur going down Blaze lol go here now don't wait eat and enjoy"}
{"text":"The idea is awesome, just like Chipotle. Pizza was excellent and obviously  fresh. Staff got mad when I asked for the pizza to be hot when served and didnt want to reheat it is only bad thing. Need these out east."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love pieology! I'm originally from California and would always visit pieology there! I was so excited to see there is a location here in Arizona! The pizza is so delicious; I love that you can pile on the toppings and still pay the same price! Add the herb butter to your pizza for a little extra kick of flavor, it's amazing! Their customer service is always top notch, but I will say they're shining star is Anthony! He is so welcoming and kind! He always knows how to put a smile on your face, in a genuine way. You can tell he loves his job and really loves his customers. I hope they hold onto him and maybe even give him a raise! ;-)"}
{"text":"Always nice to have a say on how u want ur pizza. All the kids had fun.  Pizza was yummy. Only one dough.  On the thin side but still chewy.  The variety of toppings was quiet extensive.  They don't put a lot of each topping on the pizza. So if u are not planning on more than lets say 5 toppings, make sure u tell them to double up the toppings before sending ur pizza to the oven.  My son opted for half white and 1/2 red sauce for variety.  I got my own 1/4 pizza to decorate since I was not hungry and shared.  Everyone walked away happy;)"}
{"text":"Good price, good pizza, great service from Mike, even for Pieology Noobs who tried to order everything at his station. 

I like the fact that he pointed out that gorgonzola was a blue cheese. I knew that, but that obviously helps avoid disappointment for lots of people. Very cool"}
{"text":"Such great attitudes and smiles they are under new management and i love it the bad apples seem to be plucked out and they are so much more Accommodating"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Customized thin crust pizzas... yum! 

The line moves quickly and the staff members are friendly, efficient and generous with the toppings. The restaurant is perfect for a quick and casual meal, and I just love reading all the inspirational quotes on the wall! 

There are signature pizzas, packaged salads, and desserts as well. You can also get whole wheat or gluten-free crust and have your pizza topped with pesto, barbecue sauce, house red sauce or buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"This is a really great place to go to if you're shopping around Downtown Summerlin and you get a craving for pizza, but don't wanna wait around for it. It's fast, super affordable for unlimited toppings ($7), and very satisfying. The original crust itself is thin and crisp, and has olive oil applied before hand to enhance the flavor and crunchiness. They have a very nice variety of toppings including multiple types of cheeses, sauces, meats, and vegetables; and if you want, they can even mix the sauces together which is nice. The area itself is reasonably spacious, and during the main eating hours, it can be pretty packed, which is usually a tell tale sign that you are about to indulge in something good. I really appreciate the location as well because I feel that Summerlin is a good midpoint for a lot of my friends, so no one has to really drive far to meet up here."}
{"text":"Most Yelp regulars have figured out that customized, wood-fired pizza on an assembly line is one of the hottest fast-casual food trends right now. There are places like this everywhere, but do our pieologists have what it takes to break the mold? 

This is the thinnest thin crust I have ever seen. Anywhere. It's not necessarily crunchy, either, but hard, rubbery, and tasteless. It's like a minimalist vessel that simply acts as a delivery system for delicious toppings. In their defense, however, some pizzas are surprisingly low in calories. Half of one was good enough for me...and that logged in less than 500! Not bad. 

I was craving spicy, so I went with the buffalo chicken pizza...this is the best buffalo pizza I've had! I was worried there wouldn't be enough sauce, but whatever they're using is actually spicy. Really gets the job done. Cheese is high quality, and so was the chicken. 

I tried their side of \"savory herb strips\", a vague name I'm sure some legal team came up with because there is no way these can pass as real breadsticks. Coated with oregano, way too much olive oil, and just the right amount of minced garlic, these were a reminder that the crust is unorthodox. So rubbery, they were quite difficult to pull apart! The marinara on the side was boring! I wouldn't waste the calories on these again. 

I can't imagine the crust would hold up heftier toppings, and while I'll try a traditional pie from here, I'm not sure how enjoyable it will be. At the very least, this place is really really good at one item I crave, and that's a-ok with me."}
{"text":"I have picky eaters and this place was a hit for my boys. They loved picking what they wanted on their pizza and watching it being made. Only negative would be the take out. By the time I got home , 6 mins away, my pizza was soggy. Will definitely be back but for dine in only."}
{"text":"Checked in to this neighborhood pizza joint this evening and ordered the Alfredo Alfredo pizza. The concept is pretty cool, the restaurant is clean and most importantly the food was prepared fast and taste pretty good...

$7.99x2 well spent"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars but honestly I was super sad to discover this pizza doesn't match up to its competitors .. the price point is pretty high especially since I am used to being able to get single topping pizza options from my preferred build your own pizza place ... the sauce is not really flavorful and frankly the pizza was so hard and burnt that my tongue still is cut up..

The staff was great and everyone was friendly which is why I am going with two stars .. Usually I wait a few visits before doing a review but I just don't see myself going back here ..

If you do plan a trip make sure to sign up with their e club to get a free treat"}
{"text":"Great pizza options and love the create your own. If you have a gluten or daily allergy, they take great care of your food to avoid cross contamination. I've never seen a place like this before. Definitely recommend going to this restaurant. Nice casual and quick place to eat."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza here.  To me, it's just as good as Fired Pie.  I still like MOD Pizza the best though...out of all these similar concept pizza spots. I liked the layout of the place. It was very clean and modern and reminded me of the inside of a Chipotle. The customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"Even better then the first time.  That's right, 2 days and 2 separate Pieology locations.  I'm hooked!  This time I brought a friend with me who was just as mind-blown as I was.  Great pizza, friendly staff, amazing price.  Yes, yes, yes."}
{"text":"This is my first Pieology experience, I came hungry and left satisfied!  What a great deal for anyone looking to personalize their very own pizza.  From cheeses (plural) to the amount of sauce, and don't forget all the ingredients you want.  Amazing!  I built my very own combo for $7.95 and it came out in a flash.  Being from Chicago it's hard to find good pizza in the Las Vegas valley, this is it.  Cheap, fast, delicious on the go pizza.  Great, great, great."}
{"text":"Came in to lunch with my family. No greeting or anything from the guy or the girl working the line. They were both super grumpy. The guy was putting the sauce and cheeses and we weren't done with telling him what kind of cheeses we want yet and he'd pass it down the line already. I also told him for the sauce I wanted BBQ and he just assumed I wanted the BBQ chicken pizza they had and started making that. Moving on to the girl adding toppings, like I said she was really grumpy, no greeting and was throwing the toppings on the pizza. I get it, everyone has off days but we're still paying customers and we just felt really awkward asking for toppings coz we felt how unhappy she was to be there and it really showed. The cashier was a lot nicer, but they were very unorganized with their communication that I had to keep repeating how many pizzas we had ordered. Pizzas are ok here, especially for $8 a piece. The BBQ pizza came out with no BBQ sauce but the cashier girl who brought it out quickly fixed it. food here is ok for the price. It's getting a 2 star because of the service."}
{"text":"Oh my god. 
First time here. 
it's a chipotle.. For PIZZA!!!
Literally couldn't be more satisfied. 
I can't."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am not a pizza expert and I know this is a franchise but It's still awesome. Thin crisp crust; Unlimited choices of ingredients and quick food. Every time I come here I'm always pleasantly surprised. I've never ordered the same combination pizza but they were all great. I love the quotes on the wall as well."}
{"text":"Nine dollars for a high quality pizza with unlimited toppings? Count me in! The place is also really clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Loved it! Super thin and crispy crust, the sauce is more tomatoey than spicy which is how I like it:) my aunt and my fiancé both loved it too!"}
{"text":"First time at this place and I ordered 4 different types of pizzas. 1. Bbq chicken 2. Buffalo chicken 3. Alfredo 4. The vegetarian 

All pizzas we're great, but my personal favorite were the bbq chicken and buffalo chicken. The buffalo had a good kick to it, so if you like spicy I would definitely give that one a try! This place reminded me of a chipotle but instead for pizzas. They had a great assortment of vegetables and sauces. I'll be coming here again very soon!"}
{"text":"Service is always good here, they're so patient with questions and the manager is always walking around, checking on guests and clearing the area. Definitely come for the pizzas, but I wouldn't recommend if you're just coming for salad. The Caesar salad I got looked more like a side salad and the lettuce was bruised. Plus side, plenty of bacon when I requested in sub of chicken."}
{"text":"Creative twist to Chipotle and Subway! Built my own pizza including unlimited toppings can't complain at all. Perfect place to have a date night. Price is not shabby either for 8.60 also! Definitely a place to be creative with your food!"}
{"text":"Custom personal pizzas, hundreds of thousands of possibilities! Alfredo sauce, pesto, barbecue, buffalo...and classic red sauce. So many veggie and meat options!"}
{"text":"My pizza was burnt and this place sent out a false promotion and did not even bother to send an email apologizing for their mistake. I had found out it was a mistake when I arrive to buy my pizza and for their mistake they said they would give me a buy one get one free coupon but I never received one after my purchase. My pizza was not worth paying 10$, I ended up paying 25$ for two pizzas and two drinks. My pizza looked like someone had taken a piece of it. I will never come back to this place, I should've just stuck to Pizza Rev instead of coming to this awful place."}
{"text":"Great pizza....I love that you can build it the way you want and have it ready in a matter of minutes.  The place looks super clean and the service is supper friendly.  Lucky to have you guys down the street"}
{"text":"Came in today and brought my family to enjoy a promotion that was e mailed to me. The promotion was for PI Day. When we arrived there were large pink signs all over the store saying that the e mail was sent out in error and there is NO promotions honored at this time. When I asked for an explanation, an employee said that the corporate office sent out those e mails and that this particular franchise did not wish to be included. As a business owner I can see how frustrating this could be, but once the promotion was e mailed out with the particular location in it, you MUST honor it or risk making your customers very upset. This is what happened. They chose to NOT honor the promotion in which forcing me, my family, and anyone else who asks me about this restaurant to never come back. I will NOT patronize a business that does not stand behind their advertisements. Please DO NOT go here!! There are a lot of equally good pizza places very close that have better business sense."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a custom pizza! Still working out some new opening kinks but overall excellent! Shout out to Romeo the pizza runner who was getting everyone their correct pizza even though the table numbers weren't matching up with correct pizza orders."}
{"text":"Think of subway had a baby with a pizza and there's the idea behind Pieology Pizza. After doing some shopping in Downtown Summerlin we just wanted something quick. We stopped by here and decided for the same price of the other pizza the best option was to just get a build your own pizza which is what my sister and mother ordered. I couldn't decide and went with the bbq chicken pizza. The sauce was too vinegary and was my least favorite of the three we ordered. Just remember toppings are unlimited so don't be afraid to ask for more. They can be kind of skimpy with certain ingredients like our version of a white pizza we made ourselves. Well they made it but you get what I'm saying. I had to ask several times for more ricotta as she out barely a few teaspoons on our pizza. I've learned also that the crust is super thin so it's best to pile on the ingredients. All in all this is a cheap option for pizza but it's been the least favorite of the places I've tried. I wasn't impressed. I think it's better for kids as a self proclaimed pizza fan I'm not a fan of Pieology it's just alright."}
{"text":"well it's the same workers who give you the same excellent quality that it was when it was Project pie but now that I got taken over by biology or really bummed because we lost all the motivation slogans that used to be posted on the wall the pieces fast and hard at the bottom of the escalator on the way to the entrance to MGM from the underground and it's fast quick and easy for under ten bucks instant Pizza Subway Style"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT IN CHANDLER that is allergen free when requested. As someone who is intolerant to Gluten, Dairy, Soy AND Peanuts I'm not someone who regularly gets to eat food the majority of the population would call 'good'. 

Pieology is my one exception. Their gluten free crust, along with the dairy free Daiya mozzarella they carry are a lifesaver for someone like myself with severe food intolerances. Despite the kitchen being an easy place to cross contaminate dishes the crew have ALWAYS taken amazing care of me and I've never gotten sick on one of their pizzas in the almost 40 times I've gone to this place since it's opened. 

Not only is the food awesome and edible for people with intolerances the service is the best thing of this store. I consider Collin, Caleb and Alysha as friends of mine and I've never walked into the store without someone sparking great conversation. All three of them are the freaking best, and they deserve a bonus FOR SURE Mr Manager ;) 

Thanks for being such an awesome crew of people and such an amazing place to eat. I owe my taste buds to this damn restaurant :) 

Also, it's not a bad place to catch some epic Pokémon if you play Pokémon Go"}
{"text":"Packed at 2 pm...good sign.  Pizza was nicely articulated and perfectly cooked in a wood fire type stone.  Brilliant and fresh tastes.  Staff cannot be more friendly.  Very pleasant experience in a sea of so many other lv valley choices."}
{"text":"We'd been wanting to try out Pieology for some time now and finally went last night.  The pizza really wasn't great.  In fact, the crust was uninteresting and bland.  The sauce was also boring.  The toppings had little flavor and were quite skimpy.  Overall, you get an $8 pizza for $8.  

We also tried the salad which was nice, but the chicken is not tasty at all."}
{"text":"$7.95 custom pizza with unlimited toppings? I'm in! My Cali friends rave about this place and I was pretty stoked when I found out it was coming to Vegas. Pieology is basically the Subway or Chipotle for pizza and you get to eat it 4 minutes after you make it!

The place offers a fast, fun, creative dining experience. Pick you crust (gluten free is an extra charge), pick your sauce, pick your cheese, pick your toppings, and then your meat! We usually go for the custom pizza versus the Pieology creations. The few times we had the Pieology creations, they were just OK. Pieology has nothing on CPK's version of a BBQ chicken pizza.  

You have to like thin crust pizzas to eat here. Fortunately, our crust has never been burnt! Kudos to the staff for doing their job. Staff could use a little bit more training in the customer service department. They seriously never smile or seem very welcoming. 

Honestly, this is not the best pizza out there. We are big fans of Grimaldi's. Usually, 1 pizza is good for me and my husband, but we always order 2 so we don't get bored of one. They have half sized pizza boxes, which is the perfect size for the portion we bring home. For a group of 3, two pizzas is sufficient with no leftovers. 

You can add sauce after your pizza is cooked. The drizzle of pesto is pretty tasty! We've had the cinnamon bread once and it was okay for me. Skip! Go walk off the carbs and get yourself some delicious gelato or a cookie ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love pizza. 
It's best when you make your own pizza anyway you want it. 
Unlimited topping for like $9 bucks. You definitely can't hate on that. 
I wish they would open one by my house. But with time this place will become the next McDonald. 
I wish they had more options for desserts other than that. My experience is flawless."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Thin crust and delicious!! I love that you can get as much of anything you want you have to just ask and they're so nice about it.  I will always come back i love it"}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place recently and said he liked it for the price. I have to admit coming from the Bronx I am a Pizza snob so I might be a little picky when it comes to pizza. I am sorry but this place is really bad. My friend has lost all credibility as far as I am concerned. There is no crust. It is basically flat, thin dough and put what you want on it. I had red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta and meatballs on my pizza. No flavor at all. I guess when Dominos, Pappa Johns and places like that exist this place will also, but not for me. I will stick to the good pizza places in town like Montesanos, Verrazanos on Eastern, Settabellos, Noras , Pizza Rock and if I want a deep dish The Chicago Brewing Company."}
{"text":"So went to this place for the second time to try it for lunch today To have the most horrible service ever.  Girl that was making my pizza didn't want to be at work, didn't care about my request. After every topping kept asking me is that all? Like at least three freaking times. Felt like she's trying to get me out of there. If it does say unlimited toppings, it means unlimited toppings. not go cheap or put less on toppings than I requested. Had to ask a girl three times to put extra toppings on my pizza. Like I was at Subway instead of a nice pizza place. 

Will never return to this place. Owners of this place need to stop hiring high school kids or Young kids who doesn't care about their work ethics or come to work just because for a paycheck. You get paid to do one job which is to make a freaking pizza for what customers are requesting. 

Pizza tasted ok also because the girl went cheap on the toppings and the sauce. felt like I was eating bread.  Little Cesar pizza tasted better and no that's a shame."}
{"text":"Very good and fast pizza. The cashier is a cashier because he has burnt his hand on the pizza oven multiple times, even after one month of employement. Might not have the brains to cook a pizza, but a truly dedicated pieologist."}
{"text":"This location is in the \"underground\" part of MGM, between the parking garage and the lobby. When we saw, we already decided it'd be our dinner. 

$12 to make your own pizza & pick from different toppings and sauces. 

The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because they claimed to be switching from \"Project Pie\" to \"Pieology\" therefore they didn't have the kind of sauce or toppings we liked & couldn't make the specialty pizza we usually get. So we opted for a different kind, which still turned out great.

Hubs and I spent $30 for the both of us. More than what we usually spend at Pieology but understandable since it's located on the strip. 

If we had known they didn't have the full variety of sauces & toppings that a normal Pieology does, we would've drove to the one on Flamingo & Paradise. Service was much friendlier at that location too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to be die hard blaze pizza lovers. We were shopping down here and decided to give Pieology a try. We were not disappointed. Maria and Israel were so sweet to us and made sure we had the best experience! We came in right before closing(sorry guys) and they even offered to pull some ingredients to make fresh just for us. The vibe was amazing. If you're thinking of converting I hope this review will help you finally try it! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good, quick, well-priced pizza

It's amazing how many made-to-order pizza places are cropping up. Pieology is an excellent option if you are in the mood and it's the favored spot for our little ones. Prices are very easy to follow and a good deal.

Entering, you have some standard options, an array of ingredients to choose from, and an array of drinks. You can pile on quite a bit if that's your thing. There are also some salad options, though I've never had one and can't vouch. 

The staff has been super friendly on all our visits. They are very cool with kids, which rocks. Having options the keiki get to choose from makes it enjoyable and they get to be in charge some. And the pizzas hit your table in less than ten minutes, meaning it doesn't require a ton of time and patience. :o)

Another plus: Overall taste and quality of ingredients seem to be above par.

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Best pizza I had since I lived in New York. How do you cook a pizza that fast and it taste so good. I will definitely be back!  Good prices too."}
{"text":"Without eating 5 stars. Helpful and lots of choices (meat $ veggie) including crust. Kool name. Drove past saw the name and had to stop in. So you know the deal. When in the area a give them a try.

Aye a slice in the parking lot. My new pizza spot!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after a friend recommended it. Unfortunately I have nothing to recommend about this place. 

The concept is, in theory, very simple. You walk down a line and order your pizza exactly how you want it. However, it proved to be extremely difficult for the incompetent employees to get my basic cheese pizza right. 

First, the woman making the pizzas skipped over me and pretended I didn't exist. I finally got her attention and she created a pizza for me that was so small I thought it was a joke. The manager came over, looked at it, and tossed it in the trash without saying a word. 

She made me another one and I proceeded down the line. They screwed up the order of the woman in front of me so after I chose my toppings, they decided my pizza was her redo so I had to start the process again a third time. 

I paid for my pizza and sat down. I literally ordered a pizza with only mushrooms. I noticed the 4 people who ordered after me got their pizzas before me. I walked up to the counter and saw my pizza just sitting there being ignored. I'd never go back to this clown show of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I love everything about the concept.
One price pizza - CHECK
Unlimited Toppings - CHECK
\"Chipotle like\" setup - CHECK

PRO-TIP - If you want a crust that's a little more chewy, TELL THEM! They'll take it out sooner. It's thin and crispy usually, but with a decent flavor. The wheat is actually more tasty than the regular. You pick the cheeses, you pick the toppings, and it's cooked to order. 

It's not the best pizza on the market, and some of the quality of ingredients should be improved. I would easily pay 10.00 a pizza if they had better ingredients."}
{"text":"Wonderful idea for a pizza joint! Great prices and friendly people behind the counter. It's a clean and easy place to grab a pie. After we built our pizza, it took about 5 minutes for it to be served out to us. They even stack up to-go pizza boxes if you have leftovers by the soda fountain so you don't have to ask for it."}
{"text":"Not off to a good start....went there today and they would not honor the Monday $5.00 pizza coupons Pieology emails out to their eClub members.  There was 3 other people in line besides myself wanting to use our coupons and all we got was attitude!  The pizza was good but there are a lot of places that serve good pizza, the thing that sets great restaurants apart from the others is service and that we did not receive."}
{"text":"We were promptly greeted and the menu was explained to us. The pizzas were prepared as requested - the \"Subway\" of pizza. I will tell you that the pizzas were ok. I do not know if the ovens need to be cleaned or what it was - but there seemed to be burnt crumbs on the bottom of our pizzas that impacted the taste for me. 

I am also not a big fan of the thin crust pizza but I would try this location again. They serve coke products and no brewed tea option to avoid soda."}
{"text":"I went there with friends the other night and I was baffled about the horrible customer service. We loved the food but the service was awful. They took forever to get us our food and our food was put in to go boxes when they were supposed to be for dine in. They probably sat there for 20 minutes. My boyfriend went to check to see what was going on and they told us that that had happened and the kid working the line didn't even care. It said dine in on the receipt so there was no excuse. And then it took over 5 minutes for them to put the pizzas on trays. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible. My friends and I were rushed and were told that they \"like to keep the line moving\" but there was NO ONE else in the place but us. There were no mushrooms and I was given an excuse that it was a problem for them too, I honestly don't care, you should have it in stock, it's standard and besides as a customer it's not my problem you're out of an item so no need for the pity story that other customers were giving you problems about it. Pizza was decent, I like the concept of making my own but I would not return to this location."}
{"text":"Custom made pizza, reasonable price, and cooked in a huge oven(not a conveyer belt). This has quickly become a staple in my eating out regimine and has topped all major competitor like pizza hut and papa John's. Your best bet for pizza night hands down."}
{"text":"The food is great the staff are friendly, really couldn't ask for more 
I understand it's fast casual, and not fine dining, but they really should be charging more for their pizzas! 
$8 is really a steal!"}
{"text":"Just really good honest thin crust pizza exactly the way you want it.  The novelty of it makes it a fun place to take the kids.  Top notch ingredients. Service and staff was also top notch.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Love Pieology. But this place is SLOOOOOWWW.  Only other Pieology I've been to is in Westwood near UCLA and they've got their team together.

There's no fire in the workers at this Summerlin one. Unfortunately, it's the only one closest to me so I just have to plan accordingly. Food is still Pieology fresh and tasty.  But teach these kids that Time is Money!"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try! The employees and manager had great chemistry and well SO nice and accommodating. They didn't even judge the obscene amount of mushrooms I require to enjoy a pizza!! Great food, great people and awesome prices!"}
{"text":"I want to give this review 5 stars, but it seems as if the staff here is lacking customer service. While my pizza is always great, I can't say the same for my customer service experience. There's no greeting when you enter. Upon reaching the counter they stand there and look at you crazy. They're easily irritated when you take to long to look over the topping selection. When you have kids it takes them a min to decide. The counters never seem to be clean (Morning or evening). One employee had an attitude because I asked her to wipe the counter before she made my pizza. I have a food handlers card, and there were some rules being broken. It wasn't the cleanest. Yes messes will happen, but geesh. I'd hate to see them get less than an A. Evan is always pleasant and smiling. He makes sure you're satisfied. The girls attitudes are less than desirable. The management really needs to work on who they hire. I come here because the pizza is good, but am considering coming less or visiting another location simply because of the attitudes of some of the staff. Give Evan a promotion."}
{"text":"so wanted to try an alternative to blaze. not stoked.  first they started making the completely wrong pizza. whatever, not a big deal. so then the server was supposed to bring my side sauce, but they never came back so i got it myself.  also not that big of a deal 

what is a big deal is their pizza was so nasty it tasted like a cheap frozen pizza that you can get for a dollar similar to totino's pizza.  the cheese was so cheap and processed it hardens shortly after it starts to cool..  

after a few bites you just start to feel icky from the super low grade ingredients.  I would not eat here again, if you do want this style food, i would recommend going to blaze off Decatur, which is worth the wait"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Pieology in Las Vegas - we had a great time! 

We had a party of 15, that walked in out of the blue. At this location, they had an incredible staff super friendly, fun, and accommodating! 

If you've never been Pieology is a pizza place, $7.99 for a personal pizza (that realistically is good for 2 people). You can pile on as many toppings as you desire for no additional charge!"}
{"text":"It's funny because I had no idea what to expect when walking in. I had a taste for pizza and wanted something new. Well you can choose one of the signature pizzas ornbuild your own. Of course, I built my own. They have so many different crusts, sauces, toppings and seasonings to choose from and then it's placed in the oven to cook. It was very good and bursted with flavor. The customer service was spot on."}
{"text":"Pieology is by far one of our very favorite pizza places in Orange County. While we love to see more variety with the toppings what they do have is incredibly fresh delicious and goes well with the pizza bases. Would love to see them expand the salad menu as well but for a good custom pizza it's amazing"}
{"text":"I was SO excited when this place opened. I have been quite a few times, and each time, they skimp on the toppings, you have to ask them on every topping, for more. They don't have as many topping options as Fired Pie. And a couple weeks ago I asked the manager about other them getting some additional toppings, and he was beyond rude to. I won't go here any longer. If you can't be nice, you don't deserve my business. I'll drive way out of the way for Fired Pie now, even though you are only 5 mins from my house. What a bunch of jerks!"}
{"text":"Got a pizza with olive oil, red sauce, mozzarella & parmesan, pepperoni, meatball, and bacon. It was pretty tasty with some oregano sprinkled on top, but it tasted kinda spicy... not sure if it was the sauce or what because it didn't used to be like that. It was just certain bites here and there but I wasn't prepared for it. Still pretty good overall."}
{"text":"So disappointed!!! What good does it do to order online then go pick up the pizza and HAVE TO WAIT for them to cook your pizza!! The assumption is that I dont know how much time 20 mins is??? Ridiculous concept!!! Its also not worth the cost of the pizza!"}
{"text":"Hooray for vegan pizza! My friend and I ate at Pieology Pizzeria in Downtown Summerlin for our post-hike meal. According to the Pieology nutritional information available on the website, the whole wheat crust is vegan (at least from what I can tell). This location also has daiya cheese, which is a welcome addition to any pizza menu. 

RUSTIC VEGGIE ($7.99): Minus the mozzarella and ricotta cheese in favor of daiya cheese. This pizza is loaded with tons of veggies, to include corn, red and green bell peppers, and basil. I added mushrooms for good measure (at not additional cost I might add). This pizza was packed with flavor, although the crust is on the thinner side and the pizza itself was pretty floppy. The personal sized pizza is more than enough for one person, and I had 3 slices leftover. 

The pizzeria was clean and our food was out within 10 minutes. I'll definitely go back to Pieology if I'm in the area and am craving a vegan pizza.

{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I have had since moving to AZ.  The staff is always super friendly from  the second you walk in the door to the moment you leave.   The manager Mike not only has an amazing crew but is out there making sure his guests are happy and enjoying their visit.  Both Mike and Mariah have recommend choices I wouldn't have tried otherwise ( who would have thought Alfredo and BBQ sauce would be good?.....well it's fantastic) and Have loved the different combinations every time.  Definitely found my new lunch spot."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place and their staff!  Love their pizza but I think it's the welcoming crew that always make our experience that much better.  Was in there again today and David came over to make sure we were enjoying everything as usual.  And even though the place was jammed, he took the time to talk to us.  The owner is even getting to recognize when I come in with my Mom and daughter and made a special trip to our table to say hello.  You would think we were living in a small town!  Add in reasonable prices and great foot, how can it get any better?"}
{"text":"I have been to Pieology 3 or 4 times. The first time, I quite enjoyed it. After that first experience it has steadily gone down. My most recent encounter has left thoroughly turned off. I will never come here again!
Upon entering the restaurant on a Monday around noon, there was a descent sized line. That in its self is not a big deal, however there were only 2 employees working. I waited in line for well over a half hour, all the while listening to one of the employees tell customers that were complaining \"3 people called out, the GM is on vacation in Hawaii, and he's not answering our phone calls\" blah blah blah. No apologies, no we'll be right with you, just excuses. Like I said I have been in here before and its not the first time there has been only 2 employees during busy lunch rush. Next, now this is what is making me not want to ever return. The employee that was preparing the pizzas was going in and out of the back to get things they were out of, NEVER ONCE did she remove her gloves (until she was asked by a customer), she continued making pizzas and touching food after touching the door to the back and whatever else she was touching in the back. I, starting to get grossed out, said something to the person that was with me. The person standing in line in front of me heard me and turned around and was equally grossed out.  As a matter of fact the person in front of me asked the employee to change her gloves. Although I appreciate that she was now preparing food with clean gloves, every food item she reached her hand into was now contaminated. The next issue was that they were out of at least half, if not more, of their toppings. Again, as she is explaining to people that they were out of whatever, never apologizing or anything."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat. I had all the toppings I wanted for one flat rate. The service was quick, and the staff aas friendly. Move over chipotle, there's a new sheriff in town."}
{"text":"The first time I tried Pieology was in California over a short vacation. Since the day I had it, I've been longing for a location here in Vegas. Finally, they opened one.

If you have not been here before, this place can be compared to Subway ... but MUCH better. 

You can let your mind go wild at Pieology with its limitless options to build the pizza of your dreams. You can choose any and all 3 sauces, 4 cheeses, 6 meats, 11 toppings and 8 flavor blasts for endless combinations of delicious pizza. 

I may also add that your pizza creation, however you make it, is ONLY $7.95 ... WHAT?!

Now, my review is only words. I would suggest you come and try this place out. If you love pizza, you will love this place. The high ceiling, bright lights and vibrant atmosphere is ideal for any situation. 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Customer service is superb! Great fresh pizza, of course. Love the Vegan option Thanks to Anik and her staff!"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner at 8pm after dance class.  They were super fast and very friendly.  Madison even came to our table and asked us if our pizza was good.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really good Gluten free pizza. 

It's almost unlimited toppings! 
They said there is a limit however I asked for extra pepperoni and other items and there was no problem. 

Overall good pizza, you pick which crust you want then start with the sauce, what veggies and then meat and other items you want. 

Fast service friendly and good price, for a Gluten free pizza it was $13.40 so not bad and I think it's a 10\" pizza. 

It's right beside a Chipotle grill walking distance from Ballys Casino."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of times the food was great came back the next time they have no more wheat crust no more herb butter and no more spicy chicken then they put all my toppings in the middle of the pizza what a big disappointment"}
{"text":"Great service! Maddie was super helpful! Margarita pizza was delish! Super clean and great for families!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, friendly service was just as impressive as the fast, fresh, and delicious selection of unlimited sauces and toppings on my custom pizza. From ordering my pizza to piping hot at my table in less than 5 minutes!!! I made the perfect Greek style pie with herb butter, tomato sauce, mozzarella, parm, feta, red onions, green peppers, kalamata olives, artichokes, roasted red peppers, and chicken!  Can't wait to go back to try another pizza creation of my own at Pieology."}
{"text":"When I eat pizza with my family, it is usually a compromise: I like \"stuff\" on my pizza and they don't. 

Here, I can go nuts and get exactly what I want while they get their boring \"cheese and sauce\" pies. 

Pieology is a lot like the other \"u pick\" pizza places, but they have some other options like a thick crust (\"pie rise\") or gluten free crust. 

Like the other places, though, it suffers from the indecisive customer syndrome: the line moves pretty fast until someone at the front can't make a decision. In my experience, the employees moved everyone through as quickly as they could: there were plenty of staff to handle the assembly line and cooking. While we were waiting for our pizza, I noticed a \"line stall\" when someone was apparently trying to order two pizzas but seemed to have no idea what any of the toppings were and had to have questions answered about each one. The employees were very patient, but the other people in line started to get a little impatient, I think. 

Our pizzas arrived in an appropriate amount of time and tasted hot and fresh. The toppings were good, and their soft drink offerings (three types of lemonade) are a little different. 

Maybe it was just crowded when we were there, but it felt like there was not a lot of inside seating: while we were in line, we were trying to decide whether we should ask for \"here\" or \"to go\" based on the available tables. By the time we got to the front of the line, the place had emptied out a little and we were able to get a 4-top. 

I'd go back again: there are so many options to try."}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be good considering it has high ratings. The issue seems to be with cooking their gluten free crusts. It was burnt around the edges yet all of my toppings were just as cold as when they were put on the pizza. I'm not sure how that happens but it definitely made my lunch unenjoyable. My husband's regular crust pizza was fine, but also not piping hot as it should have been. Another letdown as a gluten-free eater (not by choice)."}
{"text":"I choose this place over the pizza places near it simply because they're better! Always a good pizza and the staff is nice even when they're busy and it's late. I ask for it extra crispy and they never mind doing that. Also they will answer all the questions you have about the ingredients cause there's a lot to choose"}
{"text":"\"The Chipotle of Pizza\" 

The person who said that nailed it. The place even looks like a Chipotle.You go in and order a pizza and tell them what you want from the line of toppings, like a Chipotle or Subway. For $8 it's a pretty decent little pizza. They're pretty much all thin crust from what I observed and the people working there are very friendly and helpful. It's a good spot to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good.  Depends what you like on your pizza.  Got two pizzas in less then five minutes 7.99 a pizza.  I'd definitely say you gotta dry it.  Very friendly staff and pizza is really good. Definitely enjoyed the pizza I got."}
{"text":"I came in with my whole company for lunch and these ladies did not miss a single order as we came through this delicious assembly line that ends at a glass of lemonade. PieRise Margherita was so filling I got through the rest of my meeting so happy."}
{"text":"$12 to make your own pizza! 

This place was the first eatery I saw when getting into MGM from their self parking lot. There wasn't that many people when I got there around 1pm on a Sunday. The employees here were pretty friendly especially the cashier. The ingredients looked fresh, woot! The eating area was kept very clean, there was always someone cleaning up! 

It takes about 8 minutes to bake in the oven. When it came out, it smelled, looked, and tasted delicious .. Maybe cause I was super hungry... The crust was super thin, just the way I like it. 

Will be back again..!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.   Multiple crust, sauce and toppings are available.  You can customize your pizza however you want.  I chose the regular crust.  I had them mix sauces and load it up with veggies.  When I asked them to add more, they gladly did so.  Then they fired it up in the oven.  Kids also like to be able to choose and get what they wanted.  It's kind of an experience.  My crust was thin and crispy, just the way I like it.  I would go back here again.  Good place to get exactly what you want on a pizza."}
{"text":"What is there not to like about this place? Make your own pizza, huge selection of ingredients, specialty ingredients not offered anywhere else, and it all tastes so damn good. I just wish they had more locations here in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here is Amazing and the service is wonderful. This is my husbands and Ia favorite place to come. We make sure if we're in Vegas we stop here!"}
{"text":"A Chipotle-type operation, this place delivers great pizza at an affordable price. You pay one price and can add a number of different ingredients to make your pizza as unique as you are. Everyone is quite friendly and will recommend ingredients that go well together, in case you are a noob at mixing flavors. 

This place is great for large groups as well, as their dining room has ample seating space. Best of all? Your pizza literally takes less than 5 minutes to bake. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Team took the time to fix an accident at the condiment station, where some one loosen up the red pepper flakes.....

Awesome pies"}
{"text":"A second Pielogy location? Awesome! I used to go to one in Orange County before I moved here, so it is nice to see they've made their way to Las Vegas. This location is right by UNLV, which is convenient for students like myself who are looking for a place to eat near campus.

I love the freshness of the pizza here. Everything is done right in front of you, from pressing out your dough, to adding your toppings and finally placing your pizza in their stone oven. It is so customizable too! They offer an abundance of options for your crust, toppings, and sauces. I usually get the Hickory BBQ Chicken Pizza, made with Mozzarella & Gorgonzola cheese, chicken, cilantro, red onions, olive oil, and of course, barbecue sauce. I like to add mushrooms as well.

It's $7.95 for a regular sized \"personal pie\" with unlimited toppings. A bit pricy for pizza in my opinion. Also, as much as I love thin crust pizza, it burns rather easily. The last time we came here, half of our pizza was burnt around the edges! Next time I would ask for it to be made less crispy. Other than that, Pieology is awesome. Their hand-crafted, Artisan-style pizzas are definitely worth a visit. (Or more!)"}
{"text":"We stumble upon this place when our usual was closed on New Year's Eve. They allow you to pick as many toppings as you want. 

The young man who took our order was friendly enough but was not very good at putting toppings on. I asked for pepperoni and he put four slices on my pie... Literally FOUR. I ordered three pizzas and they gave me someone else's by mistake and gave mine to someone else. I asked to have it corrected and they did make me a new pizza which was very nice customer service. 

The problem I have with the pizza is the incredibly thin crust that the pizza has. It is like a cracker. The plate they bring it out on has holes in it so it gets cold as the person walks it out to you. I wish there were a thicker crust option. I will probably be back."}
{"text":"I don't think I was as impressed with this place as others have been. I didn't get excited when the worker said they were like The Subway of pizza, hopefully they don't use flip flops in their pizza crust! 
Well we just wanted a snack, so we went pretty safe and got a Classic Margherita Pizza and added ham. It was just okay, nothing special. We went with house made crust, it's a pretty thin, crackery crust.
We purposely picked this place because they had outside seating and we had our dog with us, so that was a plus on their part.
The establishment was busy and clean. Staff was friendly. 
Not sure if I'd go back, there are a lot of pizza places like this in town, some are still around, some have folded. It's in a good location with hungry people, so it may do alright."}
{"text":"Pieology is really great- build your own pizza! I really liked the crust. thin with a nice chewiness to it. topping were fresh and there's a good selection. I love that the will drizzle pesto or other toppings on your pizza after its cooked. we also had the dessert pizza which was super good- esp since it was $3 and feed all 5 of us. the email club gives you coupons and a free pie on your bday. super nice staff- the manager was great. we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza!! The BBQ Chicken pizza is really good. I've also had the regular cheese and margarita. Whole family loved it!"}
{"text":"Another Cafeteria style create your own Pie place.. This one is in line to the other 2 bigger names..

The pesto here was actually better than my other goto place.. Same fresh ingredients and options as the others as well... In the mall area, you cant go wrong with this place.. Not sure how long it will last, as the \"area\" is well traveled, and business seems slow every time I pass by."}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for pizza. Crispy thin crust, unlimited toppings for $8 and ready in 3-5 minutes. Already brought friends here and they're enjoying it too.  Def worth checking out, convenient to the strip and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here. We were skeptical, ordered, ate, and now were huge fans. Tasty stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my top 3 all time favorites. I love making my own creation. And the staff is always keeping my laughing and smiling. Mercedes herself is a tremendous person. I so recommend this place to any and everyone. Bring your appetite. Best place for a family dinner or a cute date."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  They have only an 11.5\" Pizza.  The crust was very thin and crispy like a cracker, they were very skimpy on the toppings. We ordered red sauce, mushrooms, onions, black olives, pepperoni.  The pizza was very flavorless, the sauce had no flavor.  No plates, not even paper plates.  Not my kind of pizza place."}
{"text":"We love checking out Pieology whenever we have a show or event to attend at the MGM! Just think \"Build your own Pizza in a pinch.\" There are great choices for a personal sized pizza and tons of toppings to choose from. You choose your crust, then your sauce, then your cheese, then your proteins, and then your veggies! I like their veggie options that include broccoli and even artichokes and the fact that you can select thick or thin crust. The food comes out quickly so that you can head to your show without being hungry!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!!!! They also gave gluten free. I love the buffalo pizza with blue cheese"}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided we would try pieoligy today!!! We left that place super satisfied and both agreeing on the fact that we would come again. Let me start off by saying that I am not much of a pizza girl... But this build your own pizza thing is genius!! We walked in and the layout is the same as chipotle. You line up and when you get to the front they ask what kind of crust you want (regular or wheat) and then you proceed along the line while you watch them put them fresh toppings on your pizza. I love that they have different choices, not much of a marina gal so I got the pesto and added some delicious toppings. They finish it off by cooking it in one of these brick ovens!!! Awesome! Then came the part where we pay. I was sure that food this high quality would be more expensive, but nope. My husband and I sat down and the waiter brought us our pizzas. He was very polite! That first bite was love! You can just taste the freshness! The pizzas are big enough to even share with someone (which my husband and I will do next time, you can do seperate sauces and toppings on each half). As we were eating we did not speak. Just ate. And then a gentleman who looked like a supervisor came over and asked how we liked everything.. We said we loved our food and he looked very satisfied. He truly wanted to know how our experience was and we had no complaints!! A few people walked in and walked out (the place just opened).. Too bad for them! (Excuse the empty panda container on the far right of the pic, my son is 3 and hates pizza!)"}
{"text":"Wednesday night and this place was empty! I can't believe it. This young crew tonight made some outstanding pizzas! Derrik was awesome very friendly and I noticed when there's no customer to make food for he was busy cleaning and checking on the customers who were in here dinning  we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It took me a long time to try this place because of the location being inconspicuous, but I am so glad I did!  The pizza is custom to your order but the best part is the crust options and seasonings; the taste is great and the price is amazing!  $8.29 unlimited toppings and kids $4.29!  They also have beer and wine by the glass.  I think they may have a Monday special for $5 but I have never made it here on a Monday!"}
{"text":"Love that you can build you own pizza for a fair price. Always fresh ingredients. Never a long wait and is perfect for a quick lunch spot."}
{"text":"This pizza place is not bad. For a quick and cheap pizza. This is the place to go to. One pizza will fill you up. You can put as much toppings as you like. Build your own pizza your way. Everyone is different. Make it to your own taste."}
{"text":"Was on the lookout for some food before heading downtown. Like all other locations, the place was clean outside and parking was plentiful. Strangely, the line was non-existent( It was a Wednesday afternoon). The interior is very spacious and the workers are very kind. The pizza is, you guessed it, delicious. These guys know what they're doing. Worth a drive away from the strip if you want some real food at a decent price. Sometimes it's good to get away from that \"Vegas atmosphere\" for a while to recharge. This is the place to do it."}
{"text":"This place this the best! I visit weekly The girls that work here are always so great I'm so happy and greet me every time I walk in with excitement I'm glad that i have a great pizza place to come to josh is great at making sure that the restaurant is clean and running smoothly thanks again for always having me and being so pleasant! And the watermelon tea that they have is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, definitely generous with the toppings which is a plus!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for awhile now and had never been disappointed until today. I have a gluten allergy one of the main reasons I go here ( pizzas are good) today I had to tell the girl not to use the regular butter and sauce but the get it from down below. Then my pizza was over cooked and burnt on the edges. I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"For all the thin crust lovers out there, this is your place! For the deep dishers...you probably will not enjoy this place.  The crust is perfectly crisp and thin, with a nice crunch with each bite.  This is like the subway of pizza...you go down the line and pick your items. For $8 you can put ANY TOPPING on your pizza and as much of it as you want!  The service is amazingly fast, with the pizza coming out in less than 10 minutes. I mean really, where can you find such an offer?!  I opted for two sauces on mine, herb butter first and then alfredo on top.  But really, you can split the pizza in half and have two totally different sauces....the options are limitless.  I can't remember the exact combo of all the veggies and meats I put on there, since I got a little greedy and picked almost everything.  Like other reviews, yes they are a little skimpy with the ingredients at first, but I just asked them to put more of whatever I wanted.  They were happy to oblige, without any complaints.  The only one minor issue I had was with the sausage.  I like Italian sausage with a little pepper/heat, but the sausage here seems a little bland.  I honestly can't wait to come back, thin crust pizza is my favorite and now I can have it my way every time, without paying extra for each additional topping!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place.  You can make your own pizza. You get thin crust or for $1 more double crust.  My favorite is double crust. The best time to go is Monday's for their $5 pizza deal. It can really get full so be prepared for a wait.  I'll keep coming back when I can."}
{"text":"First time being here,and as a big Pizza fan, I have to say well done. A true Italian Pizza is a thin crust almost cracker like crust. With the fresh sauce and toppings to go along making an over all excellent Pizza experience for me. I did however order the dessert as well, keep it to pizzas, desserts aren't your forte."}
{"text":"I wanted pizza (when do I not?) for lunch and had to also run some errands.  Avondale is not too far from me, so I decided to come down here and check out Pieology.  The ordering process is the same as all the rest of these type of places, so I won't go into too much detail.  I ordered my pizza with meatball, pepperoni, onions, ricotta, garlic and spinach.  I asked for it well done, and about 10 minutes later it was ready.  They bring this out to your table which is nice.  Here is how it was................

Pizza-  The pizza looked pretty good.  I did notice that the crust was really thin along the edges and didn't really have any \"body\" to it.  I also noticed that they could have used a sharper or more precise pizza cutter.  The pieces were hard to tear apart.  Those were my 2 gripes.  The rest, was all good!  The size of this pizza was huge.  I can usually put down one of these pizzas like its nobody's business, but this one seemed a little larger than all the other places.  I was struggling to get through the last 2 slices.  But, I'm no pussy, so I ate everything on my tray!  The flavors were wonderful!  The pepperonis curled up nice and crisp and had a little pool of grease inside of them.  I loved it and this was the best pepperoni I have encountered at any of these type of pizza places.  It was fantastic!  The other ingredients were really fresh and the flavors were great!  The thin crust surprisingly held up really well, too! 

Overall, I thought it was very good!  I will definitely be back because this is probably the closest \"do it yourself\" type pizza place to my house.  Service was great, price was par for the course (A little over $10.00 for a pizza and a drink (Coke products) isn't bad at all!), and the pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"So glad that there is finally a pieology near my house! I've been waiting for so long and I hated driving all the way to the flamingo location.

The customer service in this branch is great! They're fast, friendly, and the workers always keep the restaurant clean and tidy.

I've been here several times and they always make my pizza perfectly - crunchy crust and not a soggy middle!"}
{"text":"Loved this pizza! customized 11.5\" pizza and all the toppings you want for $7.95?! Yes! it's true. I especially loved the very thin crust. We chose 2 house made dough. one had pesto, mozzarella, feta, kalamata olives, red onion, artichokes, spinach, chicken, mushrooms, tomatoes and banana peppers. the other had marinara, mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, and spinach, tomatoes, basil. seems like a lot of toppings, but it's scantily put on and you can ask for more, but we were fine with what was offered. remember the  crust is thin and it can't take too much weight! 

We shared 2 pizzas amongst the 3 of us and it was perfect. you don't get that heavy feeling in your stomach like with usual pizzas that have thicker crusts. This was our first visit, but there will be more! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw a Pieology opened in Vegas, I first tried it in California and just always love their pizza, this one didn't disappoint me and I also brought my boyfriend and his daughter here, for the first time I see his daughter finished the whole thing, I guess they weren't disappointed as a first timer either lol"}
{"text":"This place has great and fast service, the food was amazing and well worth the price. It was such a great family fun night out building our own pizzas. All in all the experience was a great one and we will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Customized Pizza with unlimited toppings!  It was so good!  My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed our pizzas.  Over the counter type of restaurant with chairs and booths. Personal-sized pizza: my husband is a big eater and one pizza for him was plenty!  I only ate half of my pizza and saved the rest for later. You can choose white pizza or sauce on your pizza, and they have tons of toppings to select from. Thick and Think crust were both delicious... whatever you prefer.  Thick crust was a dollar extra.  This is located in the MGM Grande Underground."}
{"text":"Ok I'm from Detroit and I know pizza but this is so Good because you can put whatever you want on it and the crust is super thin like a cracker and glueten free. I highly recommend this place and price is only 8.00 for an 11\". Will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for the soft opening and once again I was not disappointed.  Been to the Summerlin location many times and was excited that a location was opening closer to work.

Sure, the wait was long but the the pizza was free.  I would have gladly paid for it.  The staff did a great job as well and things went very smooth for an opening. I'd also like to call out Brandon the manager and Mike.  Still not sure what Mike does but both were really nice and kept the crowd entertained.  I love to see the management talking to guests and serving guests and just creating a great environment. 

So far I've taken my family, neighbors, and now co-workers.  Pretty soon I'll run out of people to take and have to go just because.  I'm good with that too.  Welcome to Vegas Pieology!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest there is something very off putting about going into a Pieology and seeing how it is literally a copy of the Chipotle design in every single possible way. The layout is identical, the business model is identical, even the logo looks the same. And it is not owned by the Chipotle people so that makes it even weirder. Have you ever gone into a windows store and been annoyed at how it was literally an apple store? Me too and this is the same.

Im going to go out and say it. Chipotle is terrible and I think we all know that. It will always be C level fast mexican food and that has a function I understand that. Yes it also has Vegan options so some love that but no one is going to say that Chipotle is mind blowingly good. 

Pieology is pretty much exactly the same. Custom pizzas made in an assembly line and baked while you sit and wait. The pizzas are simply okay. It would be hard to say they are particularly good or bad pizzas because they are just average thin crust pizzas. You can get better pizzas at regular pizza chains I think that is pretty obvious. This place tries to give you innovative pizza options but ultimately thats more of a pathway to disaster than it is success. Some strange combinations can and will get created here.

I dont have any specific items to review because basically you just construct whatever pizza you want. The premise is a good one, but it's also one with limitations. The food can never be amazing if you get to construct it because you just have no idea what makes a good pizza a great pizza.

Perhaps I am too hard on this place because it's not trying to make amazing pizza just quick fun pizza. And I get that and to that end it is a success I guess. Is it better than Chipotle? Obviously. Do not tell me how can you compare mexican and pizza because thats not my point. 

But the ultimate question concerning a pizza place is this: is the pizza restaurant good enough to justify getting in your car, driving to the restaurant, constructing your pizza in line, waiting for it, eating it at a table, and then driving home? You have a plethora of pizza delivery options at your disposal so the above question needs to be answered a yes to justify a visit. The answer is obviously no. The pizza has to be incredible to justify that amount of time and effort. It is not incredible by any means. 

If you are walking through the boring part of downtown summerlin and feel like pizza okay then go ahead and eat it. Otherwise? Skip!"}
{"text":"Are you a fan of statistics? I'm not. Probably my least favorite subject in college.
But I really found these interesting:
Out of 66 Yelpers rating Pieology:
40 have done less than 10 reviews and 20 of those have done 1 or 2. Of those 20, 19 gave a 5 Star.
Only 5 reviews were done by Elite Yelpers and only 1 of them gave Pieology a 5. The other 4 gave it a 4.
Only 17 reviewers \"checked in\" which actually validates that the reviewer was really there.
The most recent 18 reviews were all 5 Stars. 
Well, that is until this one. Don't misunderstand me. I liked Pieology. The food was... fine. As good as most of the fast casual create your own pizza places. 
C got a half day at school so he and I decided to check out Pieology. C got the create your own Pie ($7.95). His was basically a meat lovers type pie. Sausage, Pepperoni, meat ball, Mozz and red sauce. It was interesting that he didn't finish it though and not because it was too big.
I ordered the Create Your Own Salad ($9.95) So before I even start, this is 2 bucks more than the other places charge and seemed to be a bit smaller. Sure, the produce was fresh and ultimately the salad tasted fine. But what am I paying 2 bucks for? I wouldn't come back for a salad.
No staff ever came by to see how we were doing and unfortunately my interaction with the \"manager\" was listening to him talk on the phone with a customer about a catering order. For 5 minutes or more. Put it this way, by the time he was finished talking on the phone and rang us up, C's pizza was ready. Next time, transfer the call to the office and have another employee ring up customers. Standing at the front counter waiting to get rung up wasn't cool.
So all in all, the food was fine. 5 Star worthy, nope. 4 Star worthy, not today.
Average food, higher prices than the competition, service needs improvement. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. Like chipotle for pizzas! My best friend and I came here today. Service was quick and the pizzas were so tasty and ready fast. The Alfredo sauce was very good especially considering I don't like traditional pizza sauce. I also got mushrooms, Canadian bacon, and mushrooms but there were so many options to choose from! Great selection. And it was only $11 for my pizza and a drink. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Ugh was so excited to try this place because of the good reviews. Extremely bland and not flavorful what so ever. To make matters worse, I had such an awful stomach ache after eating here. On the bright side, the staff was SUPER friendly and probably the only enjoyable thing about this experience. Sadly, I don't think I'll be back. :("}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had! The man who helped me was named Sean and he did a great job assembling my pizza! It's sounds crazy saying that but I've been to places where the toppings are not evenly placed all over the pizza and they are cheap on placing ingredients. Sean made my pizza so every bite will be delicious! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is not pizza, but it tastes ok. Crust is kind of a cross between bread and a tortilla so not even close to real pizza dough imho. That being said, the ability to walk up to the counter and build your own pizza chipotle/subway style is fascinating and fun! The place was clean and the staff was courteous and personable while making my pizza/thing and checking me out. The end product tastes OK - crust as described, marinara sauce very sweet and mozzarella cheese maybe not really cheese. When I put the leftovers in my toaster oven to reheat, the cheese wouldn't melt! I probably wouldn't come here again for pizza, but just its as good as a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"The taste was okay, they messed up on my wife's pizza, I went about two weeks after they opened so I expected slow service and I was right and it wasn't even packed. Employees had no training what so ever, its no blaze pizza but it's convenient"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great pizza. Employees are personable and don't skimp on ingredients. Pizzas consistently come out great. If you like thin crust, highly recommended."}
{"text":"We found a treasure in Summerlin that reminds me of the great Mexican restaurants I grew up with in San Diego. They have great food and exceptional service. My family and I will be back in soon."}
{"text":"My favorite thin crust pizza from now on!

I love how you can choose as many toppings as you like for less than $8. Personal pizza that can feed two! And if you're in a rush, you can get your pizza in all of 5 minutes. Can't beat that.

Since this place is pretty self explanatory, I'll just tell you how I made my special pizza.

SAUCE: red sauce. And extra red sauce.
VEGETABLES: basil, red onions, green peppers, mushrooms, grape tomatoes, roasted tomatoes, garlic (the server probably thought I was a vegetarian)
MEATS: meatball, ham, pepperoni
Result: fantastic.

The Hubby's pizza:

SAUCE: herb butter and 3 cheese alfredo
VEGETABLES: red onions, garlic, cilantro
MEATS: spicy chicken, sausage, bacon

Result: i thought it was salty but the hubby thought it was great!

We both loved the super crispy thin crust. So yummy. We were going to take the pizza to go, but we were too tempted to try at least one slice. Well, one slice became half a pizza. It is best to eat the pizza hot!!

We'll be coming back.. A lot!"}
{"text":"Just served by the worst server ever. Put salami and ham on half of my pizza, told me they limit portion...the sign says unlimited toppings, and should at least cover pizza...then she got an attitude...I work with approx. 1500 employees in the area, I just posted my experience on our community message board. I'm sure it won't affect their business at all...horrible...Blaze from now on...."}
{"text":"The only reason why I give this a 2 star rating wasbecause the others working at this location are very nice, but the manager Rosie had the WORST customer service in the world. Also, she's helping make the food and she keeps touching her hair and isn't wearing any protective hair net. That's my two cents.... if customer service and sanitation matters, there ya go."}
{"text":"For starters I understand that it was pi day but ,they ran out of mushrooms and olives and had none in the back . Then when I asked for my pizza to go they brought it out to me on the pizza trays and not in boxes so I asked to have them boxed and one of the employees acted like it was a inconvenience for them. also I have five pizza and the same employee forgot to bring me a pizza bag to carry them out in . Then I got home and noticed they forgot to cut some of my pizza like come on guys ."}
{"text":"Wow,  it's been a minute since I posted a review, as evidenced by the naked profile with the absence of the Elite tag.  Life can do that tho...  I seen this joint when Downtown Summerlin was coming up and finally got to try it for myself.   I am a fan of Novecento, yet,  something tells me Rocco would be disgusted.   

Upon entry,  the set up looks a lot like Smash Burger, the way the line corrals you to the upcoming pie slaughter along the chic decorated wall.  There are menus upfront,  but that didn't  help much for the indecisive first time customer that I was.   Eventually,  I just threw the menu in the air and ended up pointing out menu items over the counter like MJ shopping in an antique shop. #RIPMJ

You are offered normal thin crust or gluten free,  several types of sauce from red,  pesto, etc.  I went for the olive oil base then on to the veggies.   I remember basil,  green peppers,  red onions,  artichoke,  two types of olives (?), mushrooms and more.   I like to pile it on when it comes to the green.   Next is the meats which is surprisingly the least exciting in the crescendo.  I opted for pepperoni, sausage and...bacon?!?  I didn't know, I panicked and didn't  want to hold the line up.  All together, the pie totals a little over 8 bones.  

Not a bad deal and better than a premium sub sandwich or glutton burger that would equal that price.  Personally,  I think the quick fresh pizza phenomenon is the hook.   Why hit up Sbarro's for pizza way past the danger zone, wilting under a heat lamp, when you can have a decent sized instant pizza minus the nuke process!  

My combo wasn't the greatest tho, next time I'll up the stars when I find the right algorithm.  Calling all upscale soccer moms!  We found your next team outing...Booyakah Booyakah!  #shabba"}
{"text":"I love the concept of making your own pizza the toppings you want and the sauce that you want!! The staff are friendly. The eating areas are clean. I don't mind coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a pizza place that's worth paying for to get any unlimited toppings on your pizza. This is my first time a pizza place like this. I'm a fan of thin crust, so this place is fits me perfectly for that pizza cravings. I say it's worth it and the restiarant is pretty clean and modern."}
{"text":"Great pizza and staff is very friendly. It is not right on the busy street I just happened upon it on my way to a different restaurant but I am glad I stopped. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Im not really a pizza person but I was actually really happy with the final results! You get to pick what you want on your personal pizza, which is wonderful because I'm picky and I don't like to share ha-ha. Once we received our pizzas we were immediately asked how we were by a fellow named Frankie and were accommodated throughout the rest of our meal. The General Manager even helped us find a dessert place around town when he really didn't need to.
We Need one in Utah! Great service and great food. Nice job guys!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 minutes just to find out they are out of vegan cheese. Had to turn around and leave. Waste of time"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night and I was very pleased! They have a lot of toppings and sauces to choose from--I got wheat crust, tomato sauce, mozzarella, mushrooms, ham, and spinach. The pizza had a great crunch to it but my only concern is I wish there was more flavor to their tomato sauce. Overall great experience, and great concept with the \"Subway\" style pizzeria."}
{"text":"House red sauce + mozzarella and parmesan + pepperoni, sausage, meatball, spicy all natural chicken, Canadian bacon, black olives, mushroom, red onions, green peppers, artichokes and garlic = scrumptious pre-slumber meal. 

And the crust was cooked crisp through and through. 

The only thing missing: anchovies. 

But for $7.99 (plus tax) it's a friggin' steal.

Place was clean. The crew worked FAST. 

I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"I love this place this was one of my first pizza places with this concept that I really liked compared to all the other ones to be honest it's always a tossup between this place and mod pizza in Goodyear so I guess it just depends where I'm at and which place is closer but this place is good to go the ingredients are very fresh"}
{"text":"Great pizza and service. The toppings were generous, the crust perfectly crisp, and staff very friendly. We were asked what brought us by, and my husband mentioned it was my birthday. After our order was placed and brought to the table, they kindly brought a free plate of the sugar cinnamon dough (which was amazing!). Mike in particular was very attentive. We look forward to returning. Family friendly place and menu!"}
{"text":"Had a quick meal here with my daughter as her school held a fundraiser here! When we walked in I read the menu about building your own pizza and thought this could be fun! I have to be honest and state I really didn't enjoy their pizza. I found the crust to taste like a breadstick and was dry. I would have preferred some fresh ingredients versus canned. I was surprised as no sun dried tomatoes or basil that I could see and I did ask. The price point was reasonable for what you get as our dinner was under $20 for two personal pizza's. A down side was that we both  ordered at the same time but my pizza came out way after my daughter's pizza did. 

A fun and new place to try but I will stick to my favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"These types of pizza places have been gaining popularity across the country. They use a thin crust dough and they add toppings in front of you the same way they would at most sub-sandwich shops. The pizza is cooked and served within 10 minutes. The pizzas are reasonably priced as well. The food is good and the staff is friendly.

I like this place, located in the Summerlin mall area. It's got a nice look and feel and they have a nice selection of toppings. They have specialty pizzas which include the number of calories for each pizza which is nice for me because I do try to count calories as best I can. I usually go for the Buffalo chicken pizza and add spinach and tomatoes. You can order to go or dine-in."}
{"text":"I rarely ever eat pizza because 1) I'm not a huge fan of bread, and 2) I need a multitude of vegetables in every meal.

Luckily, Pieology allows me to put as many vegetable toppings as I want! Love that it's thin crust and you have the option of whole wheat!

It's also affordable and around $10 a pizza, which you can easily share with someone, making this meal cheaper than many fast food places.

Although the pizza did surprise me with it's affordability and customizable options, it was the service that really blew me away. Everyone was SO FRIENDLY and did not seem fake at all. Even at more upscale or expensive restaurants I don't receive such great service! The pizza was good, but the fact that I felt happier walking out than I did walking in is what makes Pieology 5/5. 

Tip: Get the vegetable pizza but replace tomato sauce with pesto!"}
{"text":"Just had a pretty crappy first time experience here. The place was being run by either teenagers or young adults who seemed to be messing around a little, but I didn't think much of it at the time. 

My daughter and I went through the process of picking the toppings and paying for the pizza which went fine. We sat and a little while later we could smell our pizzas burning which caused me to look up to see what was happening. 

One young man was spending time changing the change in the tip jar into dollars and apparently forgot them. I observed this, but no one came and talked to me, they just hastily put together another pizza for me, which was a mess, then cooked it in a rush (as in, it wasn't cooked enough, dough was still underdone) and handed it over. Not once did they mention what happened, and didn't seem to notice that I was watching the process.

We got them to go, and after waiting 20 minutes through this process, I just wanted to leave so I took what they gave me even with noticing my daughters pizza was definitely overcooked and mine was a mess. Once I got home, I also noticed it was underdone.

Given this experience, why 2 stars? Well the taste was actually good, even with one being overdone and one underdone. I would assume this would be great pizza if it was cooked properly, but I'm not sure whether I would return if these are the normal employees. Maybe they were just weekend people, but someone needs to teach them their jobs come before changing out money in their tip jar, and if they do screw up, to not make it worse by doing a quickie \"fix\""}
{"text":"I got the Margarita, and it was pretty good. The server did warn me of no tomato sauce, so that was helpful to know of in advance, and I appreciate that. The side salad is pre-made, boxed,  with that strange chemical taste. Didn't love that at all. Probably my main reason for the rating. I may or may not try again. There is a pizza place across the street. I'll try that next."}
{"text":"Pieology was pretty much the mid-point of my husband's old job and mine so we met here for lunch often. I much prefer Pieology to any other fast-fire personal pizza place because they don't burn the bottoms and the sides of their pizzas. I always order mine with the high-rise crust (I think that's what it's called) for $1 more, it makes the pizza tastes that much better. My husband and I used to get two individual pizzas but since we'd never finish ours, we just started getting half and half on one pizza. It saves money and that way we don't have any leftovers to store and possibly forget at work. He usually gets pepperoni, mushrooms, and pineapple on his side and I usually get just cheese or chicken, roasted red peppers, spinach, and garlic. The service is always friendly but I do find that it doesn't matter if I place my order ahead of time; it's most likely not going to be ready when I get there. I had an hour lunch so I'd usually go before my husband and order so it'd be ready when he got there fifteen minutes after me.  It's a little out of the way now but I'd definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"Pieology pizza was on point! Straight up fire. the pizza is fresh made in front of you exactly how you want it. I ended up eating the whole pizza to myself with in 5 minutes because it was so good"}
{"text":"So I'm here for the first time and I can say this their crust is prefabricated and when you get it before any of its toppings inhabit the pie , you can see it looks like some cheap tortilla type shell for crust.  So I proceed to order because who knows it may be the Business! Well not right.  The pizza dough lacked any pizza dough quality.  The meatballs I had were mushy and salty.  Onions, bell pepper , olives all cut in an uneven manner it looks like very little care goes into that department.  The meats look pre frozen and they taste it. The dough is disappointing and it totally refutes the purpose of getting a pizza baked from the fire.  If you are from the east or a pizza fanatic that has preferences and understands that the resistance in the dough which makes it pizza and makes it memorable than steer clear from here.  I will not be coming back especially because the concept is a rip off of Chipotles. It is totally a pizza chipotle but without the quality chipotle gives you."}
{"text":"I was gonna eat smashburger but decided to try this new place instead. The staff was very friendly and the place looked and smelled clean. One thing I really liked about this location is that they have a small patio in the back so you can eat outside (better stay inside because it's too hot outside) The pizza was not great and the prices were too high in my opinion. Maybe I didnt order well but I ended up paying about 15 just for me. My overall experience was okay, and i dont think I'll ever return."}
{"text":"been here a few times, it never fails staff is always very friendly, the atmosphere is upbeat, you have many options to customizing your pizza its fresh, quick, delicious, and great price!"}
{"text":"Yay! I had a much better experience today and me and my friend were very happy. I was accommodated by a young man and woman and they were attentive with our orders. Kitchen staff were friendly and the pizza oven, which was set on 540 degrees, popped out non-burnt crust. +1 from previous check ins ;-) 

I ordered red sauce, Parmesan, and all veggies (including corn- they have corn now!!). And my friend ordered red sauce, all veggies, sausage and pepperoni. 
Pizzas came out beautifully cooked and I enjoyed every luscious bite of my pizza. I must say, either I picked the right ingredients which fits my hunger or they put TLC on their toppings because the pizza tasted better than expected. Also better than my past previous check-ins :-)
 

I'll be coming back often; very satisfied with the improvements."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good.  You can order a preconceived pizza or customize your own.  Once it's built, its put in their oven and ready in about 5 minutes.    Service is fast, the food is fast. Like someone else mentioned, its a pizza place set up like a Chipotle assembly line. I got 2 custom pizzas, one red sauce and one white sauce. They were both equally good."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday 6-5-16 around 6PM.  These fast-casual assembly line-type pizza places are popping up everywhere so I figured I know the drill.  First you choose your sauce, then the cheeses, then other items.  So I smugly sauntered up to the counter and proclaimed \"marinara\" and the worker was like hey hey hey, wait, first you gotta choose garlic or olive oil to put on that crust, lady.  This took me down a peg.  After that I humbly completed my order and took a seat.  $10.04 got me a pizza and a regular size Dr. Pepper.  

The fella who took my order was very friendly and polite, and was actually very pretty for a man.  He had much better eyebrows than me and actually made me quite jealous.  

Not even 4 minutes later a gorgeous pizza was sitting in front of me.  The crust was thin and crunchy, the cheese was ooey gooey and plentiful, and the sauce was tangy and fresh.   I was in pizza heaven.  I could eat one of these every day.  

I've tried Novecento, Pizza Rev, Blaze, and a few others but this is by far my absolute favorite.  And it's only like 5 minutes from my house, which is dangerous.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Bad service but good pizza. I felt like the girls were just having an off day, they were very sweet but they could run a tighter ship when it comes to knowing what's on the menu and prepping your pizza."}
{"text":"First timer! My boyfriend decided to grab a quick bite and wanted me to try this place and it did not disappoint. The variety of toppings were great and well-organized for a make your own pizza place. The pizza was prepared right in front of you, freshly baked and then brought to your table within a few minutes. My only complaint is that the crust was a little thin for my taste. 

It is conveniently located near our house, which is why I question why I have never been here before. The staff was friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make you feel welcome. The environment is really cool and casual with an industrial and modern design to it. Whether you want to dine in or get your custom pizza to go, this place has something for everyone. 

Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"I passed Pieology several times on my way to catch urber. Last night, I decided to give it a shot and I'm so happy I did. The pizza was amazing!! I really like that it's made to order. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Not happy. I just ordered online today and I went to pick up the pizza at the time my receipt said and they said oh it didn't come in. They said this happens a lot. Well if it happens a lot then maybe you should take the system away and only do call ins, or walk ins. Then he told me I need to go stand in line and reorder. They didn't try to comp it, or anything. I am not one to get angry because I work food service myself, but this is poor customer service and they will not be receiving my business again."}
{"text":"Everyone here was extremely helpful and kind!!! Customer service is excellent and the pizza is always amazing! Sabrina Hartwiq, Isabelle, Olyvia, and Mariah helped my aunt and I today and they were great!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good pizza place--it's another of the subway style places, but their selection of toppings is robust and the quality of them is pretty good. Moreover, it's a fixed cost. Quite reasonably priced. I enjoyed my meal quite a lot."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! Service and food was amazing!!! Plus, everybody was so helpful there! Love the atmosphere, service, and the make your own pizza! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"So neat. like a subway but for pizza. Hot fresh pizza came out quick. Size of pizza is perfect, thin crust, tastes yummy. friendly welcoming staff. Outside seating too."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. No fresh cheese just shredded but it tasted fine. The reason why I only gave 1 star is because the place is filthy! Dirty dirty dirty! When I got there the place was empty and every table was dirty. Asked the staff for a rag and the guy offer to wipe down one for me... why not just clean them all??!! He did wipe the table but when I sat down I could see that the bench was covered with crusty BBQ and pizza sauce that was stuck all over the entire thing (see pic) This wasn't new. Crusty... like it's always like that. Floors were sticky and all the lemonades were empty except for the original. No one filled them until we finally asked. OMFG the bathroom!!!!!!! There was MOLD growing behind the seat! On the rim. Clearly visible. Dirt and grime all the way down the out side of the bowl. Paper and trash all over the floor. Even the WALLS were caked with GRIME. Disgusting!!! I have not seen such a dirty place since I visited the McDonald's on 35th Avenue and Peoria. HOMELESS HANG OUT AT THAT MCDONALDS AND IT WAS CLEANER THAN THIS HIGH CLASS PIZZA PLACE!!!! If an owner or manager is reading this, please please close for a day and clean your freaking restaurant. Teach staff to take pride in where they work! Next time I'm in this area I will go for Dickey's right next door..."}
{"text":"Usually hear once a week with my family- easy, economical way to feed picky eaters where they can choose their own toppings and cheap enough to each have their own.  Staff is nice and friendly-"}
{"text":"This is the second time in a month I have tried to make it to Pieology located on Harmon before they closed and I managed to get there 10 minutes early because they close at 10 p.m. only to find the door locked people inside dining and them tell me that they're closed this evening they open the door to let someone out at 9:50 and I told him it's not 10 yet your Google told me you were open till 10 I drove all the way over here to order pizza to go and I'm not allowed in because they're telling me they're closed if you're closing before 10 adjust your store hours on the websites so that when people Google you and it says you're open till 10 and you're not you're wasting people's time and money and effort and energy this is happened to me twice now and as a customer that's bad business practices."}
{"text":"Good pizza hits the spot after a long weekend, make it to your liking as many ingredients as you want."}
{"text":"I was sad when Custom Built Pizza closed on 215/Flamingo, but luckily for Summerlin families, Pieology just opened its doors! With the same concept of \"Subway\" but with Pizza crust instead of sandwich bread, you have no one to blame but yourself if you don't like what you got. 
They have wheat crust, which I always prefer. Both indoor and outdoor seating, which is great for Vegas.  Call me old, but I thought the music was a little louder than necessary. The to-go boxes are conveniently stacked and ready to be used right by the soda fountain machine, so you don't have to ask for one. All in all, there were five of us eating out, ranging from age 3 to 63 and everyone was able to leave happy."}
{"text":"This pizza place is amazing good! you get your own good size pizza and get to put on it what you want! I really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere is really good too! I think they have a good business here and the price isnt bad for what you get! Try them out, Im sure you will enjoy them!"}
{"text":"excellent customer service & delicious pizzas! super affordable and you get unlimited toppings, woo-hoo! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ate salad for dinner!  Mostly croutons and tomatoes.  Really just one big round crouton covered with tomato sauce.  And cheese.  Fine, it was pizza.  I ate pizza.

Since we made plans to hit the gym after dinner, I figured I'd help motivate myself and give myself a goal of burning off like 1,000 calories.  Genius, right [obviously joking but no seriously, I ate that pizza and then punished myself at the gym]?  I got myself half Alfredo's Alfredo and half Mad to Meat You.  I got artichoke hearts and black olives added for some more veggies.  I also got to pick at someone else's half Smokin' Buffalo Chicken and half Rustic Veggie pizza.  Both pizzas had a super generous amount of toppings.  Like I was seriously impressed.  One of the younger ladies tonight carefully placed all my toppings with care as well.  I was surprised since the other two make-your-own pizza places normally just toss everything on haphazardly so I appreciate the attention she gave it.  It ensured for a balanced bite every time.  After everything was topped onto my pie, they asked to make sure I was happy and it was great.  Wonderful service, seriously.  As for the crust, the crust is baked to be super crispy.  There was no way that crust was going to bend.  All in all, I was extremely pleased with Pieology!

This Pieology Pizzeria location just recently opened so everything is nice and clean.  Throughout the whole time we sat there, we had multiple people check in on us to make sure everything was satisfying.  Seriously great service!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere in this casual restaurant. Love the quotes on the wall! Pizza that tastes amazing! It is a thin style pizza. They put hot sauce on my BBQ chicken pizza once, but were quick to accommodate and remade the pizza. All you want on the pizza for one set price. I have seen a few people load it up with ten toppings. I love the gluten free pizza they have here too! They are always hopping, but get your pizza out quick. I highly recommend this place!! I have been here about five times and the service and food are consistently excellent."}
{"text":"The food is goods lots of choices. The service is terrible I must have need 7 pizzas delivered all to the wrong people. No organization"}
{"text":"I ate here at Pieology for the first time on May 21, 2018, when they had the Monday $5 pie (good only if you purchase a drink too) promotion.  I ate with a group of 8 \"Cheap Eats MeetUp\" people.

Now that I tried Pieology, I like Fired Pie and MOD Pizza the best, and Pieology the worst of the four because Pieology crust was like doughy shoe leather and not a \"crust\" at all.  Pieology ingredients didn't taste that great either.  I also did not like Pieology because the location I went to at Chandler Mall (101 and Chandler Blvd) did not have napkin dispensers at the tables like Fired Pie did.  Napkins are only at the drink station.  So if you are sitting on a long bench, people have to slide out to let ME out to  get more napkins.  I was embarrassed, because I found I needed a fork, then I needed cheese, but there were no more anywhere i could see.  only chili pepper shakers.  Then I needed him to scoot out yet again, cos I needed more napkins.  

When I had my pizza made, I specified I wanted it WELL DONE \"to the point that the crust is burnt black at the edges\".  I told them \"don't worry about making it pretty, I want the edges burnt!\"   Well the person who built the pizza isn't the person who attends to the baking.  When the pizza was brought to my table, I did taste it and nothing was burnt, the edges looked the same color as the center and and I would not consider it \"well done\" at all.  I told the guy who was bringing another person their pizza, and he said he would take it back to bake more \"just like this\" (I think he meant in the pan they transferred it to), even tho it was already sliced and paper was there.  

When it came back, it still wasn't burnt either, but somehow, it was no longer crispy like the first time it arrived at my table.  The first time, they baked in a pan with lots of holes in it for crispy crust.  I was disappointed and just ate two pieces.  The crust was not at all crispy, and dough was like soaked cardboard, really hard to pull apart and cut.  And the pizza was hopelessly stuck to the paper, so gooey it was, I had to peel off the bits of paper stuck to it, or leave the pizza behind on the paper and not eat it.  I never had that experience at MOD, Humble Pie, and Fired Pie, which I ate at Fired Pie only 3 days before, so my good experience there was fresh in my mind to compare with Pieology.   

Another thing I noticed about Pieology is not all the ingredients are signed on the glass, such as I did not see artichoke hearts, which I had my heart (no pun intended) set on, but when I said \"You don't have artichoke hearts?\", pizza builder said \"Oh yes we do, right here\", pointing to a very depleted bin (not enough int here to tell they had it, visually).  They also did not have two of my favorite pizza ingredients, 1. Kalamata olives and 2. Anchovies

Also I noticed here, that the salad fixings and list of dressings were scattered among the pizza ingredients both on the signage and the bins.  I had to scrutinize harder to pick out the pizza choices from the salad choices.   

The staff was very cheerful and accommodating. One guy in our party \"lost his pizza\".  It turned out when they delivered it to him, he did not recognize it (I said it looked like it had fried eggs on it).  Time went by and when it was finally determined that it WAS his order, the same employee who recooked my pizza, said he would make him another one, since this one got cold.

One thing I liked about Pieology was they had canned sparkling soda called Alta Palla in several flavors.  The fruit juices (only 5%) are organic and uses cane sugar instead of awful high fructose corn syrup.  the cost for 12 oz can isn't more than the fountain drinks, tho no free refills.  

I don't think I will be back to Pieology even for $5 Monday plus the drink, as MOD, Fired Pie, and Humble pie are all much closer to my home, and I like the crust, ingredients, and set up better.  But it was worth a try and now I tried all four build your own pizza restaurants."}
{"text":"I forgot how much I love this place and custom pizzas in five minutes! The place is always clean and has a nice modern vibe. Staff is friendly and patient even when you can do unlimited toppings for $8 bucks. (don't worry I wasn't \"that guy\"). I got the meat lovers added bacon and few veggies on the wheat crust..not that a pizza really goes well with  carb counting or anything but it made me feel better lol. I'll be back on my lunch break again very soon. Two pies can easily feed three people. I think the first time I may have gotten a small salad to share as well."}
{"text":"Yum!!! I love that you can create your own pizza. It tastes really good and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow pizza was good top five in my life, the price was fair and the atmosphere is awesome will come again, wish they open one in San Antonio TX"}
{"text":"These types of build-your-own pizza places are popping up all over the place, and I love the concept.  However, this one was just not as great as ones I have had before.  They used a press to flatten out the dough, which made it a lot more dense than it would have been if they would have thrown the dough to stretch it out.  I didn't like the consistency of the dough, which is the main reason of the three star review.  The toppings seemed fresh enough, and the staff was nice considering I was here on Christmas Eve and it was less than busy (we were the only ones there at 11:30 AM).  

We also got a salad, which was pretty decent although the dressing was very acidic."}
{"text":"We ordered on-line, easy order experience, and set the time of pick-up, and paid on-line.  Arrived at pre-agreed time, seeing unbaked pizza's setting uncooked in the prep area.  When asked \"why\" the pizzas were not ready to go, she replied \"it's our policy to not cook the pizza's until the carryout person arrives.\"  Really?  
Hmmm, We paid for the pizzas so we could just shoot in and get on our way home.  When asked if policy applied to already paid for pizza's - received a shrugged shoulder and \"what do you care?  Pizzas only take a few ninutes to cook...\"  Yikes.  Goid luck with your on-line program.  Not a friendly team.
Btw, we elected to turn up our oven and re-heat our pizzas because they were not fully cooked.  Be some time before we visit again."}
{"text":"Zesty Artichoke pizza on high rise crust with pesto was amazing! There was one girl working who was actually working- 3 others doing a bunch of nothing. Overall- good was good."}
{"text":"Came here the other day after class to grab some lunch. Staff was friendly and it restaurant looked clean. My only complaint was the toppings and cheese slid from the pizza itself. I was pretty much using the crust to pick up the toppings to my pizza."}
{"text":"Literally the best Pizza I've ever eaten! The staff is super friendly, and NEVER make you feel like you are a hassle or taking too long to craft your pizza, they are very helpful and knowledgeable about all of the ingredients as well. I have an awesome experience in here every time I go it doesn't matter if I get something crazy or just plain pepperoni & cheese! The sauce in incredible (ask for extra), and the toppings are always fresh. Also a great price for the size of the pizza, it's not your typical \"personal pizza\" it's actually enough for you to enjoy and not still be hungry. I love pieology & will continue to recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Everytime I've been here it's never that busy but while I sit there enjoying my pizza I notice a lot of people ordering togo which might be why it's never very busy inside. The most I've seen is maybe 10 people.

Though it may not be full, this place is delicious with a very awesome location. The pizzas are always loaded full of toppings and even if you wanted more just ask and they will do whatever they need to make the best pizza for you! Absolutely amazing preset menu options as well as customizable options with toppings ranging from pineapple to buffalo chicken and everything in between.

From a customer standpoint everyone here has always been very nice, welcoming and informative if you don't know how something may work. Another big thing is the workers always stay busy even when there's no customers in line. They are cleaning something, restocking something or whatever else they may find to do it gets done. And it shows. This place is spotless, not a speck of dirt or anything to be found. No fingerprints or smudges on the all glass doors or windows.

I've been coming here for a bit since it opened and I will continue to come back. Thanks for always filling me up!"}
{"text":"If I could have given this place a 0 I would have. 

It was my first time trying them out and needless to say, I still have yet to eat there. I walk in, I'm standing at the pizza station to order and the young man that was supposed to be taking my order didn't greet me for about three solid minutes while he was standing directly across from me. He was putting ingredients up, which is fine, I get it, you have a tasks to do BUT when we are directly across from one another and you couldn't even say, hello, I will be right with you. No one was in the restaurant. One pizza was in the over and no line! 

After three minutes I said, are you guys closed? He said no, I have to take this pizza out. I looked at him and mentioned he should at least greet someone when they walk in as well as the fact we are directly across from one another. No apology. 

I left and decided I would go to fried pie (a place I've been before). 

Customer service is everything. Quality of food is key but first impressions last a lifetime. Terrible first impression."}
{"text":"Loved this place, so many options of pizza you can make :) will for sure be going back. Also the customer service was fantastic and they explained all the steps to me because it was my first time"}
{"text":"Trust me on this, order it like this:
Oil instead of red sauce. Mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, ricotta cheese  (extra) and pepperoni. It's amazing. I visit a location in CA and was happy to see they have them in AZ now. This location oppose to CA asked me white or wheat crust. Restaurant was clean. Friendly service. Amazing food."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this since I noticed they were open! After walking around the mall with my son I decided to take him here so we could enjoy a late lunch. The employees were very polite and greeted me when I entered. The pizza was delicious. I also ordered the Herb Butter strips as well which were yummy! My 7 yr old liked the pizza too which was great because he is picky about his pepperoni pizza! All in all, the service was wonderful and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The crew is awesome, the food is great and reasonable, although they don't have anchovies they have a great variety of ingredients for pizza and salads. It's not super crowded depending on what time you go and for the price you pay you get a whole lot of grub."}
{"text":"While the the pizza is very good and the ingredients are fresh, the staff and atmosphere suck. They frequently don't pay attention to who orders what, don't take names to ensure food goes to the correct person, and are very \"whatever\" about everything in general. The choice of music is borderline offensive and way too loud to have a conversation. While I may visit again to buy a pizza, I'll only take it to go!"}
{"text":"I was assisted by Desiree. She followed my order to the letter. My condiments were so neatly placed on my pizza. Pure perfectionist! Great smile & personality. I definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good customer service. Pizza with unlimited toppings. I got the vegan cheese unfortunately no fake meat here. I got the thick crust. But it came out to more of a regular NY style. Good place to go if ur short on time. And vegan. Pizza was decent so 3 stars. Could make better at home."}
{"text":"I walked in and right away I thought of the Chipotle concept - Except with pizza! 
You choose your dough, white or wheat 
And then you add any toppings you want! 
They have a great selection of choices, which are all $7.95 for each pizza no matter how many toppings!
We ended up getting 2 pizzas and a side of the garlic bread and a drink, all for $22!
A part of me wished the dough options would involve a pan style crust because I love that stuff but it ended up being a perfect amount for me to finish without feeling that food-coma laziness after I ate. 
I'm excited for my next visit so I can make a new combination of toppings"}
{"text":"When you're really craving pizza , you're a vegan and it's almost 10pm at night ? COME HERE ! They won't short change you and close 15 mins early like the other place across the way . My husband & I were craving pizza one night after the gym , I knew I was cutting it close because it was almost 10pm and most places close around then . I went to the place across the street originally and sadly was completely ignored even though they still had 15 mins to close and the place was full . Did the employee come open the door even after making eye contact with me ? You bet she didn't . So as I started to pout , I remembered Pieology was literally right across the street ( earlier that month we went by , but it hadn't opened ) ! The heavens opened up and the guy was sooo sweet when we walked in - even though it was 10 mins until closing time their customer service was a breathe of fresh air ( or a fresh slice of pizza if you like C H E E S Y jokes - see what I did there ? Lol ) anyway , they made our pizza , including having the option of vegan cheese and it was everything I was craving . Will absolutely be back again and again . Thanks Pieology , you saved this hangry girl from disappointment !"}
{"text":"I was very hungry and persuaded my girlfriend to try this restaurant, it was my first time here too.  Once inside the place seemed to be similar to Mod Pizza. That's where the similarity ended, the 5 workers behind the order counter were confused and on the slow side.  It took 10 minutes to load the oven with all pizzas, 5 min later the rude lady asked me to sit down as I was trying to pay. I left shortly thereafter and ended up at Waba grill.  7 min later food was served at Waba"}
{"text":"Set up like Chipotle the pizza on par with CiCi's Pizza. 

 Pissy-ass amount of cheese and wouldn't let me put extra on of the mozzarella. They said I could have Parmesan instead of extra mozzarella, but I don't like Parmesan. Weird.

It was not as clean as it could have been, as reported on other reviews, but it is new so there's not years and years of built-up filth!

Customer service was excellent very, very friendly!

If you want great pizza I wouldn't suggest this place but if you want decent pizza at a good price..this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Today I was starving. I got to Pieology at 9:30 before they closed at 10pm. I was really craving Pieology because I haven't had it in a while. As I was ordering the lady didn't even say \"Hi\" or \"How are you doing tonight?\". She asked what kind of sauce I wanted and throughout the whole time of me ordering she didn't even look up. She was very rushed even though I was the only one in line. She spread my sauce not with  passion but with anger. She started from the outside and worked her way in. STEVIE WONDER would've done a better job. When she asked what toppings, she just threw it all on there and didn't even take her time spreading them out. I honestly lost my appetite because of her. This is such a cruel world to live in."}
{"text":"The first time my husband and I came to Pieology, it was beyond phenomenal! From the service to the taste of the pizza, the freshness of the ingredients, the pizza was piping hot and the crust was crispy and the cheese was gooey. We went back today and holy crap, talk about lack of consistency. The ingredients from the get-go looked not very appetizing and not fresh. The veggies were turning colors and wilting. When they cooked out pizza and delivered it to our table, it was barely warm and the meats were still cold. The pizza was super watery and we didn't even put anything on the pizza that would cause so much water to come out. As I was eating my pizza I got a funky taste of what a rotting, wet rag would probably taste like and stopped eating the pizza. My husband started picking at the pizza, trying one ingredient at a time and he also tasted something that had gone bad. We didn't complain because it's not like they would give us our money back and we didn't want them to remake the pizza. We won't ever be coming back here."}
{"text":"Probably the worst pizza I've ever had. I got the BBQ chicken pizza. The chicken was SWIMMING in BBQ sauce. Our pizza wasn't cut, my husband got the same pizza and my daughter asked for pesto sauce and they put it on my husbands pizza. First time to pieology. Not sure I'll come back..."}
{"text":"Really great positive friendly people , making you custom pies with a delicious thin crispy crust pulled on with whatever you like ... My new favorite pizza experience"}
{"text":"I liked the place. I had a pizza and my wife had a chicken cesar salad. The pizza experience was like Chipotle. Choose what you want and they cook it. My wife's salad was not very good at all. I don't recommend getting a pre made salad. You can build one yourself."}
{"text":"Went here last night and I was so pleasantly surprised! The pizza was so good! Just how I like it, a margarita with thin crispy crust. It was so cheap too! I think it was about $8-$9 for an 11.5 in pie. I'll be going back here for sure."}
{"text":"Managers a dick and clearly doesn't care about his employees by the way he talks to them. Owner should really take action."}
{"text":"Been doing the $5 pizzas for a while now. I have a family of 7, with 5 kids so this is a nice, relatively cheap weekly dinner. Went today and the lady behind the counter informed me that I could only order 2 pizzas because only myself and one kid was in line to order. I informed her that my husband and the rest of the kids are sitting at the table and I could have two come up when I pay (i ordered 4 and I'm aware it's max of one pizza per person for the $5 deal). She scowled, but went on her way. When worker #2 was adding veggies, worker #1 started adding veggies to a different pizza and leaned over my pizza, rubbing her shirt entirely across it, which was disgusting. Pay, no issues because the cashier knew our family. Get served 3 of the 4 pizzas, wait a few more minutes before going up to see what's going on, find out that #1 labeled my pizza to be boxed and it's been sitting there all this time. Personally not a fan of cold pizza. Huge turn off when workers act this way and not a huge fan of making a scene. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love Pieology!! The concept is really cool. You order a pizza for $7.99 with unlimited toppings. Upon entering you start at the counter where a pizza maker has fresh dough waiting. There are multiple sauces to choose from, a variety of cheeses, meats, and veggies. 
I highly recommend the herb butter first then add the marinara on top. I also thought adding ricotta made it even better.
The pizza crust is crisp and delicious. The flavors are perfection.
The staff is super friendly and the restaurant very clean and modern.
Highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"Staff here were very professional but also very chill. My pizza was delicious. Must go to!"}
{"text":"I expected more from Pieology today, especially since the line was almost out the door.  I ordered the rustic veggie, but was asked if I wanted to customize my order? I was already on the fence regarding ordering the rustic, now I had more options. I ended up getting the following toppings (red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, red onion mushrooms, artichokes, grape tomatoes, jalapeños, black olives, garlic spread on whole wheat crust). I ordered \"to go vs. dining in\" which was my 1st mistake & 2nd I think the toppings were too much for the thin crust, but I am also under the impression the cooking duration wasn't long enough.  

The concept here remindered me of an upgraded Papa Murphy's with an oven . To be fair the toppings were fresh, staff very courteous, location clean with cool life quotes on the wall. I'm willing to give this location another try sometime in the future. If you decide to eat here plan on dining in, the pizza doesn't hold heat well for a trip ride across town & is very messy if you plan on eating it in the car."}
{"text":"Not typically a fan of the build your own pizza type joints, Pieology is decent. The crust was cooked to my liking and I enjoyed many of the topping options. 

I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and added pepperoni because pepperoni makes everything better. The price is good and I would have no qualms visiting again for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when I learned that there would be a pieology near my home, the last one I visited was in Fullerton, CA. 

Looking forward to the opening day I scheduled a time to stop by after work, I thought maybe they would have an opening day special.. they didn't, no big deal, nothing is free- I get it.

Friendly staff, attentive, ordering started easy. Gluten free is $2 extra so I skipped it but here's the thing, I am lactose intolerant so I opted for the dairy alternative cheese \"Daiya\" come to find out they are charging $2 for it! That's crazy! I don't mind paying for a product, that's not the issue. It's clearly at no additional charge on the menu, and I have never been charged prior to this location. 

The girl asked the manager and he reaffirmed that this location is up-charging their dietary restricted patrons $2. I recommend going to the chandler location, I would rather drive all the way over there to get a fair product/price than be raked over the coals here.

All in all, I left empty handed. High feelings of anticipation followed by equal feelings of disappointment."}
{"text":"Absolutely no complaints. I was beyond excited when I found out a few months ago that a Pieology was opening in Vegas. I have been to the one in Irvine and it was amazing. 

So, if you've never been to Pieology, it's a build-your-own pizza place. I'd compare it to chipotle, except I hate chipotle and this place is amazing. But anyways, it's $7.95 per pizza. You can add as many toppings as you want. The price doesn't change. And the flavor of the pizza is fantastic. 

GO TRY IT ! :)"}
{"text":"Sooooo delish!! And the employees are super friendly! Highly recommend! This is a pizza I don't feel so guilty about!!"}
{"text":"Great food, good people. If you don't like the pizza you're bad at picking ingredients."}
{"text":"Best pizzas ever! 

I only came here because I dog seat for my neighbor and they gave me a gift card for this restaurant. Since I am not a big fan of pizza, I wasn't expecting much more than pizzas I had anywhere else. As soon as I walked in, we got a friendly welcome shout out all the way across from the kitchen. Then, we line up to pick different ingredients for sauce, toppings and veggies for flavor. Within 15 minutes, the pizza was ready to go. 

For my pizza, I picked white dough, garlic oil sauce, mozzarella, Italian sausage and meat. For veggies, I picked jalapeno, onions, garlic, sweet tomatoes, cucumber....I honestly don't even remember what else I had picked. THAT pizza was the best one I've ever had. The crust is very thin and Evert bite is juicy and delicious.  I would have finished the entire 11 inch pizzas if I would. 

I will most definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"So, I've eaten here on a number of occasions. The food   and service is normally good. Unfortunately, today I was a little disappointed. The food was still good but the service was lacking. I waited in line for nearly 20 mins. In all fairness, it was still the lunch rush but they seem to be understaffed. The individual taking my order could not get the order correct after I repeated it serveral times. Once I got to the register, a gentleman who appeared to be the manager, totaled out our order. The bill was around $35. I didn't have any change so I handed him a 50 dollar bill. It was at that point that he made me aware of the \"No Bills Over $20\" policy. He then proceeded to tell me that I could go next door to Five Guys or some other place to get change. Of course, they are not the only restaurant or retailer with this policy. Nevertheless, it is still frustrating. You would think that business of that size could easily purchase a counterfeit machine on Amazon for under $200."}
{"text":"Saw one of the employees grab basil with his hand and put it on my vegetarian pizza with his glove soaked in pork juice.... Had to actually ask for the person to change gloves....I'm grossed out, and will not be returning."}
{"text":"First visit here. The food prep area was sloppy. Ingredients were blending into each other. Isn't there a manager watching over these bored kids making my pizza? I will go again but not excited to make it  back soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place a few months ago, and we love it! I am not at all a pizza fan, but my boyfriend is. I love that I can ask them to make the crust extra crispy and he can ask his to a little doughy. Everything always tastes so fresh and delicious. We finally found a pizza place that we can go to anytime (where I will also eat the pizza)! 


Side note: The only bad thing I would have to say is that they don't have vegan crust or vegan cheese, which means I cant bring my friends here as well."}
{"text":"Pieology inside the mgm is simply amazing. How can you not enjoy making your pizza from scratch. From the dough, sauces , cheeses, meats, vegetables, you tell them how you want to make it. Good place for families and kids."}
{"text":"Shout out to Mike. Thanks for the great pie.   Completely enjoy our my pizza.  Glad to have you in the neighborhood."}
