{"text":"Très bon repas de moules frites et assortiment de bières impressionnant.  La terrasse est très bien, même si nous sommes près du boul. Taschereau."}
{"text":"Lunch 1/16. It pains me to say but the food quality has suffered.  I had bison cheek. It was nearly shoe leather and dry, with little sauce. Must have been leftovers. We have eaten here regularly and enjoyed in the past but $60 for that meal? I hope  that food service will be improved. I always enjoy the good service , great beer selection. Hope it was a bad day"}
{"text":"This is a great little cozy pub where you can enjoy a plethora of tasty European beer.  There's really only one thing on the menu you need to try here, because it is so rare and scrumptious, and that is their duck sausages. Wow. Such flavour. They're served with sauerkraut which complements the flavour nicely. Along with a few beers, it is without a doubt one of the tastiest meals you can have in Longueuil.   The service is friendly, without being overly involved, which is nice.   If you're the south shore and you're looking for a nice local place to try, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"On your way in to Montreal, here's the place to stop to get the best moules et frites! Yes there's free parking. Reserve ahead to get a table on the deck. Personally I love the beef tartare. Best Belgian beer selection I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"Ca n'est plus tout à fait ce qu'il a déjà été mais reste tout de même un incontournable"}
{"text":"Good service, mad selection of imported beers @120. Menu was limited but the food was good. Nice little terasse but I did not see the interior. We will visit again many times for sure."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a large group and we were seated in a private room. We missed out on the gorgeous main area, but the experience was still awesome overall.  The service was on point: it wasn't out of this world, but it was still pretty decent.  We went there for their selection of beers and we weren't disappointed. My girlfriend and I tasted 4 different beers and they were all good. My other friends tried many other varieties and the waiter even helped some of them figure out what they wanted to drink and was very helpful.  The food was amazing! I had Szechuan mussels with fries and it was delicious. I also tasted my girlfriend's beef stew and it reminded me of a Belgian dish I had over there a while ago.  Overall, I was very satisfied and I would definitely go back some other time."}
