{"text":"yuummm!  I love well done seafood and this place has it all seafood and every way possible plus the live music on a sunday afternoon with a bucket of Pacificos, was just perfect. there are like 6 different ones, I went to the North Vegas spot.  it was great and not so pricey."}
{"text":"This was the best seafood I have ever had!! Came here on a Saturday morning(right before it got busy). We were quickly seated, placed our order for drinks and got some chips and salsa. We had a party of 5 and instead of each getting our own plates we each ordered an appetizer size platter of different items on the menu. Everything was delicious my favorite was an avocado ceviche, I couldn't stop eating! They had different types of music playing our whole meal. The staff was very attentive and kept the beers coming! We were having such a good time that I believed we stayed somewhere between 3-4 hours. We also though we would have a crazy high bill by the end of our meal and to our surprise it was about half of what we thought it would be. All in all, the staff is great, food is smacking and the environment is fun! Next time in Vegas, this will definitely be a stop."}
{"text":"My friend took me here and man their food was delicious! I got the fried tilapia w beans and rice and flour tortillas. The fish was fried to perfection! Lightly seasoned which is perfect because I like to add hot sauce. The server was super sweet. And omg their beer w the mango bits and chile salt rim- yum! Definitely recommended for quality authentic Mexican food! I wish it was closer to my side of town but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Bomb.com but 1hour wait FK that. with all the $$ they make they need to expand the place."}
{"text":"Customer service lacked! No one greeted us as we walked in and we had to stand for like 5 minutes waiting until someone finally helped us! Food was good/ average nothing outstanding!"}
{"text":"My friends and I thought of spending a day off the strip to have some seafood and listen to music. After hours at the restaurant the dishonest and disrespectful staff not only stole my glasses but became belligerent and rude when I ran back inside to ask for them to be returned. We were the last ones there ( restaurant had already closed ) therefore staff was the only one there. Its very sad that after spending $1500 on a family dinner management would be so RUDE! 

I called the next day to talk to a manager and not only did he state that my glasses were not found but he had the audacity to hang up on me.  AHHHHHHH AND THERE CAMERAS DON'T work APPARENTLY !!!!!! #lasislitasmariscos"}
{"text":"Fresh Mexican seafood, which my husband loved and a delicious side of rice and beans for a vegan like me. 


The atmosphere is also authentically Mexican.  The place is happy with loud Spanish music and colorful decorations. 

Recommended to seafood lovers who seek to travel to Mexico without leaving Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The spicy shrimp dish and ceviche over oysters are absolute musts. Everyone seemed to have ceviche on their tables so definitely trying that next time as well."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for my husband's soccer tournament a couple weeks ago and I found this in a little strip mall (filled with spanish speaking businesses) across from FREEDOM PARK.  We were the only gringos in the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon.  Lots of families, soccer teams and other groups were seated.  You felt like you were in Mexico with the decorations, smell of fresh tortillas and the music.  What made it even more authentic was there was a guy selling purses, etc... just as if you were on a beach in a Mexican resort.  The ceviche was the best, the tamarind margarita was scrumptious and the shrimp tacos were like none other we have had.  This is the best Mexican food we've had outside Mexico...we'd love you to open one in Boise."}
{"text":"The food was good but not excellent. My large shrimp cocktail seemed as if I was having cold shrimp soup. They do have a large selection, some of the items are large portions as well. They don't offer refills on soft drinks either. Some of them of items get rather pricey as well compared to other seafood Mexican restaurants. On my visit a few days ago they forgot one of the times we had ordered, when we informed our waiter he was very polite and apologetic. Even though my previous experience eating here was poor I would give it another shot and definitely order something different from the menu. 

On a side note, some of the prices of this restaurant listed on yelp do not reflect the current menu prices. A lot more expensive now."}
{"text":"Great food, but it doesn't fit on the tiny tables!!! What happened to this place?? One of the most important factors when choosing a restaurant is comfort. I'm sad to say that they have shrunk down the booth tables and after getting our drinks and tostada appetizers the table was full. Very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Shrimps were over cooked. CUSTOMER SERVICE was HORRIBLE! Our waitress \"Patricia\" was very rude and defensive... we ordered a plate then changed our minds and swapped to a different plate got our food and she still brought out the replaced plate after we finished eating and said she could not take it back that shed still have to charge us. Not only did she argue with the costumers. But she had a very bad attitude. I mean if u don't want to be at work then don't, better to not be there than come into work with a crappy attitude and arguing with your costumers."}
{"text":"Que rica comida!!! We ordered ceviche de Cameron en salsa Verde and I have to tell you I actually just want to go back to eat that lol. The banda sucks they don't know a lot of songs. We had to sing some for them. But my 5 stars are for the amazing service the micheladas ceviche aguachiles and agua de coco."}
{"text":"6 Camrones for an Agua Chiles. Camrones a la diabla over cooked. Could of been better."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is so authentic and Good you will not be disappointed. Yes it is a couple miles away from the strip but its good and inexpensive so it works out.  I had the fish ceviche tostada and a shrimp tostada. I wish I could eat more it was so good! the service was good the server was very attentive. A cool bonus, mariachis came into to play live music. I was there with a group of 8 and we sampled each others food, everyone had a great plate of food.  They serve beer and alcohol good tequila, micheladas.  I will come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Love  love  love  this place real  good seafood so fresh very good service  live  music  banda its very busy they served  you drinks out side while you wait for  your table . Had lots of fun and  joy my food :) ;) we will definitely  come back , l"}
{"text":"The best Coctel de Camaron I've ever had! And the Micheladas are fantastic! Yes it does get crowded so expect a long wait time, but I've seen the waiters do everything they possibly can to get your group seated as quickly as possible. Yes, there is live music. So if you don't want to hear Mariachi or Norteno while you're eating, don't come.  Yes, they specialize in seafood (thus, the name). Yes, there are vendors who will try to sell you things. Another words, it's pretty much just like having mariscos in Puerto Nuevo, Mexico. So if you don't quite understand the music, the food, the culture, then don't come with expectations of something like El Torito or Chilis."}
{"text":"I've been to a fair share of Mexican seafood restaurants in the city and I have to say that I would not recommend going to Las Islitas because there are better options available!!! 

My wife ordered the shrimp ceviche tostada and the tacos el gobernador plate. Im somewhat of a fish taco aficionado so I ordered the plate of 3 tacos. The ceviche was just ok, a bit bland and nothing special. The shrimp tacos with melted cheese were pretty tasty when the green salsa was put on them.  In my opinion, the fish tacos were some of the WORST I've ever had!! The fish itself was not seasoned and was soggy from a lightly  breaded coating, but was overcooked at the same time, if that makes any sense!! Not enjoyable at all! Even worse, each taco was inconsistent with the amount of fish because one taco had a decent amount and the other two hardly had any, just a tortilla full of lettuce!!  It was not even close to being worth the $10 price for the plate!

If you're looking for a nice, relaxing restaurant, this is definitely not it! We were with a group of people and it was nearly impossible to hear the conversation because of the noise. The live music, which is usually a plus, was way too loud for the size of the place. Between the loud music and the chatter of the other customers, all conversation was lost unless you were sitting right next to the person. 

One more thing that I feel must be pointed out....the girl who rang up my check deliberately tried to keep my change, and this was AFTER a tip had already been added to my bill because of the group!!! Are you freaking serious??? I wouldn't have believed it had I not seen it with my own eyes. On a $37 bill, which was not worth it's value as is, the cashier put the $40 in the register and NEVER pulled change...then immediately started cashing out other bills! After 5 minutes, my wife had to go to the cashier to inquiry about the change, and the cashier still had the nerve to play dumb about it!!! 

If I could give this place zero starts, I definitely would! The only good thing I can say is that the server was nice and attentive. Other than that, I'll spend a bit more gas and go to La Palapa in North Las Vegas, which is outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"FOOD IS AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! MUSIC well you have the mariachi, norte√±o and banda playing one song after another so if you love it live, this is the place to come and enjoy one of their DELICIOUS MICHELADAS!! we where a group of 6 & ALL THE FOOD WAS AMAZING.. the ceviche mojaras camarones CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS RESTAURANT!"}
{"text":"always our last stop after our crazy nights in LV and before going back home..."}
{"text":"not good at all 
LA COMIDA no es muy Buena 
servisio es muy bueno pero la COMIDA claramente no no pierdas tu tiempo ay lugares MEJORES le daria 0 Estellas pero no puedo"}
{"text":"I came here after a weekend of fun in Vegas, hoping to have some amazing food.. but I was extremely disappointed. . I ordered two tostadas one ceviche de pescado and a ceviche de camaron, with a side of two empanadas de camaron. . The food was very plain and bland no flavor .. And the service was horrible they took forever to take our order and even longer to bring out our food. the only good thing about this place was the live music."}
{"text":"Iv been here 2 times now with my boyfriend and we're going to keep coming back! There's nothing like ceviche and a preparada for any day of the year. And this is the place to go! The environment of the restaurant feels so authentic!  You could only imagine how the food will be. And the service was as excellent as the food. A little over priced but a great place and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Zero stars!!!! Horrible experience! I ordered camarones sarandiados, which where not cooked properly. The shrimp was tasteless and it seemed like they where over cooked. When I told my waitress instead of apologizing she rudely told me the process of how they are prepared. I've had this dish plenty of times and know what to expect. She than proceeded to tell me she would let the manager know, and the manager never showed up. Makes complete sense of who is leading this staff, everyone is unprofessional. I'm Very unsatisfied with this place."}
{"text":"right off the bat, i wasn't impressed with the ultra-mild, almost bland, comp chips and salsa.  i did love the way they soaked my shrimp ceviche tostada in loads of delicious lime.  the amount of shrimp was generous, but the prices seem steep.  however, i will consider a return visit next time i get a hanckering for mexican style seafood.  the building itself was clean and feels wide and open.  the service was good and wait time was minimal (considering the food was prepared fresh)"}
{"text":"Showed up to this place after googling nearest seafood restaurant, ignored the bad reviews just to give it a shot. Absolutely horrible service, not sure if it is due to being too busy , but no excuses bad service is bad service. Food is average at best. Actually returned a seafood plate due to funky taste."}
{"text":"I always get the \"drowned shrimp\" and it\"s delicious. Great service and food."}
{"text":"Not the best area in Las Vegas but the food is amazing and authentic"}
{"text":"3 stars only since I didn't like my food. I ordered a Campechana and they put a lot similar crab with mayonnaise.I from Sinaloa and we don't put those
Things in a Campechana but whatever.My family ordered shrimp  cocktails
And they were good.

Music was awesome, they had a Live Mariachi band playing but hey it's not 
FREE no no no!! We had to pay $20 per song ,luckily we only ordered one lol.


I probably come back if I feel like Mexican seafood and try some other dishes
On the menu,definitely ask how is it made  before ordering."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and I ask around for a good restaurant a taxi driver told me about this place I went to eat and was awesome best restaurant in Vegas great service fresh food a lot food quality food if you travel to Las Vegas you have to eat in This place I recommend this restaurant to few friends and they told me best in Vegas live music family owed restaurant I come back to Las Vegas and I come back to Thai restaurant the waitress was great they treat you like family and we have to tell her don't bring more food basically they give me tortillas for free and nachos thanks mariscos islitas"}
{"text":"Im a big Mariscos food lover and this place by far has some of the best ceviche. The waiter was nice and the food was amazing . Will definitely be coming back on our next visit to Las Vegas !"}
{"text":"Tried this mariscos spot last week while in vegas and Loved it!  Everything we ordered was so tasty.  From the coctel de camaron to the shrimp ceviche oysters.  And can't leave out the micheladas...yum!!! Best spot to get rid of the Vegas hangover!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to be rude but my daughter and I had no service at all. We went there yesterday hoping to have a good dinner together but did not turn out that way. We ordered 1 drink each when we were seated. We ordered our food from the waitress ....and we never saw anyone again. Our food was great and spicy but we had finished our drink and we had to suck it up. Super disappointed. We asked a random waitress walking by for our check. That sucked."}
{"text":"I love this place... Especially their Oysters with ceviche on top (Amazing with a preparada by the way). They have live music which makes the environment even better!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday night at about 9:30pm. It was not very busy but it was so loud, it was ridiculous. There were two \"bands\" playing. One band had a tuba player and it was so loud that it sounded like there was an elephant in the room. I ordered a Diet Coke to start and I wouldn't have mind paying $2.50 for it, except for it came in a can. I think $2.50 for a can of Diet Coke (so no free refills) is way too expensive. In fact, almost everything on the menu was very expensive (most entrees are between $17 and $25), considering that the restaurant itself is very informal (almost like a diner), I thought that the prices were way too high. Between the high prices and the loud tuba, we didn't even stay long enough to order food. 
Unless you like very loud tuba music and like paying very high prices for seafood (given the atmosphere), I wouldn't go here."}
{"text":"Nasty. I had not visited this location in years. I ordered ceviche and it was flavorless, the fried fish was too greasy, the shrimp in the mojo de ajo was over cooked. It used to be good but not anymore. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican sea food restaurant in Las Vegas. They have the best shrimp everything is freshly cooked and I enjoy the atmosphere. Perfect to cure the hangover with there micheladas"}
{"text":"This Islitas is way different than the one on Las Vegas Blvd for sure. The food is still semi good and the menu is almost the same but the environment is different. I got the ceviche today and it was okay I give it about a 6 out of a 10. The micheladas are not that great at all I don't recommend them. The service is cool but it can be better. My favorite Mexican sea food spot is still the one on Las Vegas Blvd"}
{"text":"I was VERY dissapointed in this place. The service was horrible. The Waitress never asked to take our order, we had to tell HER  we were ready, same with the food and bill. It took maybe 40 to 45 minutes to get the food to us... I had a schrimp cocktail. I was still optimistic because the food at least looked great and was surprised  that it was good, HOWEVER half way through my meal I found a piece of octupus or \"pulpo\" as it is called which I specifically told her I did not want. I understood it was an error and I still tried to not be upset, UNTIL I chewed on shrimp shells. I can understand if a piece of pulpo accidentally making it on to my plate but crunching down on some shrimp shells is where I draw the line, at that point it is unedible.  I will never come back here and If I'm foprced to come back I will only order a michelada, those were at least decent."}
{"text":"If you want Mariscos while on Vegas this is the place to go. It's not far from the strip and you get authentic Mexican food. Good service and live music is a plus. The Coctel de Camaron is filled to the rim with shrimp and they have good portions for all their food. If you have a vehicle and want to get away from the crowded breakfast places on the strip stop on by!"}
{"text":"Let me just say.. This is my first time here, and the food is BOMB AF. This place is raw and authentic. Besides the fact that my family and I felt like outliers surrounded by a different sense of culture, we were welcomed by friendly and polite staff. And even though most of the employees spoke Spanish, there are some (like my waitress) who are bilingual. The restaurant itself was super busy during dinner time and it was very crowded. IMPORTANT NOTE: if you do NOT like spicy foods please say so because most of their food on the menu is spicy (my mistake when I ordered the fish tacos). Luckily, they were nice enough to toss it and took it off the bill. The only negatives I saw were personal: miscommunication, crowded place, and loud music/mariachi. Other than that, the food is great, the staff is nice, and the place is perfect for a grub (;"}
{"text":"I've only been there once because I live on California but I loved this place with live mariachi. I loved the food, next time I'll go to Las Vegas I'll be sure to visit this place again.."}
{"text":"The portions at this joint are beyond the normal. We ordered Ceviche, Camarones, Coctel de Camarones, Mojarra frita, Camarones ahogados, and empanadas de Camarones as appetizers. We were expecting small portions but we left massively full and had to get much of all our orders to go. 

The cocteles were overstuffed with shrimp. They did not hold back! All the food was well prepped and cooked just right. Will definitely be coming back again for sure! All 6 of us left happy and satisfied, not to mention with mega food coma!

The experience was made even more pleasant thanks to our server, Dulce. She was legit a sweetheart, and very knowledgeable of the menu and items. She was very attentive and checked on us often. Ask for her and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon, it was pack. Had the michelada while we waited to be seated. Michelada was delicious. Not too long of a wait. Live music. Seafood was fresh and delicious. Def try the pina mixta. Omg my mouth is watering thinking about it. Go to spot if u ever out in vegas and want authentic Mexican seafood"}
{"text":"So I came here on my trip to Vegas because I heard someone raving about it and all of the reviews said it was good. Well that being said I was kind of disappointed. I don't really know what the fuss is about. They have people selling candy, CDs, flowers, a song form a mariachi and I felt bad for saying no but also felt a bit harassed. I am just trying to have a nice dinner with my husband, If I wanted any of those things I would go to the store or approach you. The place itself is nice inside, looks clean but the location is a bit sketch at night which is when we went. The night we went I guess the ATM's went down so they wanted to write down our card numbers and then do the transaction the next day. I hesitantly gave them my credit card because I did not want my husband my to use his debit card. That turned out ok but everything that experience overall was weird. Save your money or go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love the food, portions are great!
The only problem I always encounter is the service! It's always 0 in my opinion!!!!! Servers have no idea what customer service is. However there's a busser that should be the server instead of all the girls. He is always nice, checks on us several times and very friendly.
Don't get me wrong but the ladies always at the register, when you walk in they all look at u but no one seems to want to do anything. I keep coming back, but i wish the service was better!"}
{"text":"Muy mal y lento servicio.. LA comida sin savor no pidan el ceviche De pescado save asquerozo. Las micheladas ni se diga .."}
{"text":"In the last 3 years I've only dined in a handful of times with friends but I do call & order their ceviche casero for pick up at least every couple of months. It is pricy (almost $30) and at least 75% of the time it's pretty good. The other times it's  either overpowered by the lime juice that makes you pucker and unable to continue eating it or at times the consistency of the shrimp is questionable... very mushy and weird tasting. But overall it's my favorite dish there.

My pet peeve however is because 99% of the time in the last year I've gotten the same lady at the register ringing me up for my Takeout order. Not that seeing the same face on a regular basis is a bad thing what irks me is that she ALWAYS  makes a point of asking if I'm going to leave a tip after she rings me out. 

Whenever I dine in anywhere I always leave a tip even when the service is not up to par. Perhaps, I'm not up to date with tipping etiquette... but I do not always tip on my Take Out orders. There's been a few places where I have tipped on my takeout orders but because they either brought it out to my car and/or it was a complicated order. 

Whenever this particular lady asks me if I'm going to tip on my almost $30 order of ceviche casero and I say sorry no thank you , she usually makes a face and continues the transaction with an attitude. On one occasion, after I said I was not going to tip, she turns around and tells the other lady at the counter in Spanish that I was not going to tip her and for the other lady to ring me out...seriously? So when the other lady took over I made sure she was aware that I speak and understand Spanish. She was very apologetic & embarrassed... not that it was her fault. 

I usually cringe before walking in hoping she's not there lol. So on the rare occasion when she's not the one ringing me out like last night then I do leave a little tip... simply because I wasn't made to feel uncomfortable or given an attitude for not leaving one."}
{"text":"I had the WORST experience at this restaurant. 

First I found a hair in my fish tacos which were also the nastiest fish tacos I ever had they don't even put cabbage on them or dice their onions.

Second we ordered ceviche and they never brought it out but brought us our check after us waiting for someone for 20 mins and still charged us for the ceviche!!! 

Third they took my card for about 15 mins and finally come and tell me that my chip wouldn't work on their machine and their ATM machine was out of service so my husband had to leave to take money out elsewhere and we were out of that hell hole. 

FINALLY I get home and check my bank account just to find out they charged my card!!! I called 3 times and no one answered so my husband had to drive back just for them to say don't worry it's probably a glitch since they only had their card machine for 3 days and we had to wait until the next day to call their card company to try and get reimbursed if not then they would give us the money back! 

All of this for some DISGUSTING fish tacos, shrimp burrito and chicken tenders. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing we had the soup called the 7s seas and a fish dish with pineapple postion is soooo big you cant finish flavor is on point, plate is bigger then ur face.."}
{"text":"When in need of a michelada you can't go wrong here, they make them just right. With your purchase you will also receive live music and you can enjoy or at least you should enjoy the shrimp empanadas and the ceviche. Good bye hangover!

Service gets two thumbs up too."}
{"text":"I used to love eating here, the food used to be great. Now the the last 2 times me and my family have come everything has gone down hill. The food has no flavor in anything we got. Like everything is watered down. From the vuelve la vida to the Jamaica to even the French fries. And the service has gone down also. Our waitress only came to the table to take the order and bring the food. \"Quote the raven never more\". Didn't even Bring us the bill I had to go get it my self from someone else. The people selling movies and flowers came by more then the people who worked there. And for the price so not worth it. They've upgraded many things but took away from the food and service. This is probably the last visit here from us."}
{"text":"I am sad I wasted my money at this wanna be seafood restaurant. I had the shrimp ceviche and was really disappointed. I took 2 bites and preferred not to eat anymore. The best meal at a Mexican restaurant should NOT be the chips and salsa!! Do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I visited Las Vegas and this restaurant was recommended it by a friend , I was excited to try because I love seafood but I ended up really disappointed!!!!
It was Tuesday afternoon , the restaurante was pretty much empty four tables the most included mine and there it was a BAND playing sooo loud that we couldn't talk me and my friend , next the service we sat down the server immediately went there with chips and salsa took our drink orders but after that she forgot about us , we saw her cleaning some tables and using her cellphone , we waited for a few minutes to see if she can come to our table but I guess her Facebook was more important, we called another server who was passing by and the last thing the food , we ordered ceviche con aguacate , extremely watered it more cucumber and lemon than any other thing , tacos el governador was pretty much a fold quesadilla with fish inside not really good , and fish tacos was ok ....!!!
So I guess weekends are better but I won't probably coming back here !!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and service was good, the prices were about average for a mexican seafood restaurant. The only thing I didn't care for was that they had two types of music being played at the same time(mariachi & banda) they should coordinate the music so that one plays than the other."}
{"text":"Walked in & it took 15 mins before someone actually noticed that my husband, our 1 yr son and myself walked in and needed to be seated. It took another 20 minutes before actaully being seated, they also kept seating other people ahead of us. After finally being seated we got our micheladas almost immediately and after placing our food it seriously took 45 mins for my husband to get his food and a total of an hour and 15 mins before I finally got mine. Our waiter was friendly and I believe she did the best she could with how busy they were. This place was super busy and noisy. There must have been at least 10 big flat screen tv's all on the same channel. The food and micheladas were absolutely delicious, however due to the extremely long wait for everything, I doubt we will come here again, unless its a slow night for them, or we just want some micheladas lol. My husband said they have the best oysters in town. If u enjoy live music, delicious food, insanely good micheladas and don't mind waiting almost 2 hours to get ur food, then this is the spot."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a restaurant to have a quiet dinner, this is NOT the place for you. On the weekends, they have 2 mariachis playing music. One mariachi sings a song, then the next one starts. It's like a dueling mariachi bar! Be prepared. It WILL be loud. The entire time. 

My family and I have been here a couple times and have been very pleased with the food. My favorite dish is the camarones al patron. My husband enjoys the shrimp empanadas. 

Next time, I think I'll try a shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Very good food but service is very poor ....food is delicious don't get me wrong !!! They Never came and ask If we need smithing !!!they forgot about us lol!!!"}
{"text":"Service was bad, food was horrible, VERY EXPENSIVE AND NOT GOOD, we got 4 plates and we all  ate about 1/4 of the plates, I don't know how this place is still in business.
I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE!"}
{"text":"The food was okay ... I didn't particularly like my order my boyfriend got steak tacos he enjoyed them . There menu can be very misleading as far as prices .... I really enjoy my beans and rice from the Mexican spots and there's was just no where near good or even editable there's beans texture was that of water literally would drip if the fork and literally had a whole pepper in it was burnt black and soggy just not appetizing.... And rice was white not the usual Orange color with peas and several types of other vegetables I just didn't enjoy . Not sure I'll return my waitress also didn't speak any English so communicating what I wanted was hard . Also they don't have a fountain soda machine I figured that was basic given the size . I paid 2.50$ for a can of Sprite . My meal altogether was 30$ n some change for 3 tacos a cheese quesadilla beans rice n two drinks . I pay 15$ and get the same meal if not more and taste way better at other places ... Disappointed really I expected more because of the reviews i read on here."}
{"text":"P√©simo ambiente,  exceso de ruido y los meseros se tardan un mont√≥n en llevar los cubiertos,  no me gust√≥ y no se lo recomiendo a nadie,  como dice afuera que es un lugar familiar con tanto ruido."}
{"text":"First timer from California at this place and I loved it! Wait time to get a table might take a while since this place is highly solicited, but meanwhile you can enjoy a nice cold beer while listening to the banda play outside. Once you're in, your ears will be greeted by more awesome Mexican music that makes you just want to grab a beer and sing along. We got our order taken pretty quick, but food wait time was a little delayed since it was pretty crowded and thats understable. Once i got my plate I could not believe the amount of shrimp that was on there. They arent stingy at all with the shrimp and well hey im fine with that. I ordered the camarones al mojo de ajo and I loved them. I definitely recommend this place if you want some good food, big portions and some good loud Mexican music."}
{"text":"Best food but worst service. This was my 3rd time here and they forget my food twice !! Like I was the first to order. I love the food but the service sucks ass !!!"}
{"text":"A seafood place with questionable seafood.


With scenes of watery docks, and fish leaping from the sea surface painted on the wall, you expect a seafood-centered menu, and that's exactly what you'll find here.  I went with a Shrimp Ceviche tostada and the fish tacos.  While the chips and salsa were good, I can't say the same for the rest of my meal.

The smallish shrimp served on the Ceviche tostada was flavored well enough, but unfortunately none of them were deveined.  I'm an adventurous eater, but I'm not trying to eat the last meal of each shrimp, partially digested.  I sent it back, and the waitress was nice enough to remove it from my bill.

The fish tacos were sloppy, with big pieces of lettuce and a few scattered red onions.  While the fish itself was lightly fried well, there was little flavor and an odd texture to it.  

The service was fine, but the product is lacking.  I can't see returning here with all the other options to explore in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend and I decided to try it. It's far from Las Vegas strip. I was very hungry so the drive felt super long! But anyway, the food was worth it! as my group came in they place a small bowl of shrimp ceviche. I said we didn't order this? But that is what they bring  when you are seated. NICE! I ordered a shrimp coctail wich was ok, but that is because i put to much hot sauce on it. Friend of mine ordered camarones al mojo de ajo..very garlicy but good. I also tried the fish tacos wich were ok.. tasted better. But I think this place is known for their ceviches. The schrimp ceviche was good along with they Oysters with schrimp ceviche on top! I will definetly come back here when I visit Las Vegas...like others said, best for the crudas! (hangover)."}

The micheladas were amazing! 
Will be visiting again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Super nice lil spot. Very clean and open feel, they have good lunch specials that are cheaper than the regular menu. Yummy food and very nice waitress!
Guacamole is very delicious and on point!


Thank you for a yummy brunch"}
{"text":"The place is loud due to the bands playing, that you cannot even have a conversation at least on weekends, I tried the ceviches and some other dishes and I was very disappointed. The only plus I would say is that the service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! It has a Mexican feel and the Mariscos are by far the best! The aguachiles are so good! I love the atmosphere! There's always a mariachi playing! While your drinking your Micheladas you get to just relax and enjoy the music! Love it!"}
{"text":"I've never been to this location before only to the other one in N. Las Vegas. We came to celebrate my brother in law's birthday and I soon as I walked in with my toddler I notice how hot it was. They didn't have AC on just a few fans on the ceiling. We were missing a couple of more people from our party so we sat there waiting for them and it just got hotter and hotter and it was really starting to get uncomfortable. Mind you it's 114 degrees outside on that specific day. Once the rest of our party arrived they also notice how suffocating it felt without any AC and we decided to cancel our orders and left. I've never ran into this issue before at the other location let alone at ANY restaurant in last Vegas! No AC?! C'mon! We left to another restaurant that's down the street called Fiesta restaurant and it was the best decision ever!!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday morning, well to start the parking here sucks!! The place was clean, the service was ok, but the food was disappointing. Everything kind of just thrown together, there was no effort in it I guess you can say. The ceviche de camar√≥n was salty as hell! The cerveza preparada was a bust and the waitresses looked and sounded like they didn't want to be there taking your order.  Probably wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Okay so this place was Hella busy. But the food is amazing. It took too long for me cuz I was so hungry and hung over. But  would come here again. Live music. This place was great idc that it took a while they at least kept updating me that they were trying to get it as soon as they can. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Yummy food but i haven't been to this location in a while and I'm thinking ill rethink it next time .The food was delicious and didn't take to long to get our food . The only reason i put a low rating is because I understand hot summer when you open the door there is a chance a fly will get in but in this case the fly situation is ridiculous I couldn't really enjoy my food i had to keep swapping at flys. Not to mention its not sanitary having so many flys.Customer service wise this time wasn't great after our waiter took our food she come back not once to check if we needed more drinks and my party finished eating and we waited maybe 10-15 min then one of us finally went to approach the kitchen area to be able to pay to leave. Ill think twice about coming here again the pecos location is definitely better ."}
{"text":"You Pay for a good time, not for good food.
I like this place because of the atmosphere. there's always something going on. Vendors coming in and out offering you the latest movies or CDs. Mariachi, Banda  or conjunto norte√±o playing constantly. this place is always full. It seems to be the place to entertain friends from out of town. Now if you looking for good seafood this may not be your place. Food is not bad but for the price you pay  it should be excellent!  Which brings me to the conclusion. you pay for a good time."}
{"text":"Great music. But the seating is horrible not very comfortable for  parties of 6 or more especially if they seat you in those ridiculous round tables even a party of 4 would be really uncomfortable. The tables are really small and no room for your plate or drinks. Besides the seating the food is good. Not omg it's delicious! ! But good."}
{"text":"Idk how this place doesn't have 5 stars! best Mariscos I've ever had!!! And the Michies are delish also... Makes me want to drive from LA to Vegas every weekend!"}
{"text":"This place has become a real let down. Horrible service and bad food. We came here on a Saturday morning.  There were six of us and everyone disliked there food. Food was tasteless and dry. The waitress took forever to take our order.  We won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Each time there is less food on the plate. Its not as fresh as before and there was not much much juice in the shrimp like last time. Not very consistent. When it's good its really good though"}
{"text":"Gave one star because the cashier lady was nice. Plain and simple: everything sucked and really overpriced. Not coming back"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for the weekend and I had to come eat here!! The food is excellent if your in town you need to come visit they have live music!"}
{"text":"Overpriced meals for what you receive. I used to come here years ago, and decided to stop by again. Food is more expensive than before, and for the price you get charged, I was surprised to get my Agua Fresca in a carry out plastic cup... Really? A ceviche for $30++ ? That's insane.... And supposedly they closed at 11pm... So we felt like we were being rushed to get out.... And then a couple walks in as we were leaving and they were seated. ?? There's better, more reasonably priced restaurants out there .... And with better service. Just saying you guys should think twice before paying for overpriced food here. Super overrated restaurant that lacks quality, service, and reasonable prices... You were warned."}
{"text":"Great food.  I don't ever make a vegas trip without stopping by...

I've had the campechana,  the shrimp wrapped in bacon.... And of course the micheladas.

Campechana is fresh...  Squid, shrimp, abalone, oysters...  cucumbers, tomaties avocado...  Where other mariscos places fail is allowing this concoction to get watery.  It kills the taste...  but islitas manages to avoid that.

The shrimp wrapped in bacon changed my life.  I literally walked out a different person.  Shrimp...  wrapped in bacon.  I mean come on??  

The micheladas are tomato juice, oyster sauce and beer of your choice. I like dos XX lager.

This place makes a great hang out for those of mexican descent.  There are conjuntos playing classic songs.  I'm not mexican so i don't care much for it.  But its still fun nonetheless.

The environment is a bit on the paisa side but what do  you expect from a mariscos joint?

The staff are really friendly and they are eager to serve.  Every time i visit they greet you with a smile and make great recommendations. 

I'm glad I was introduced to this place...  very glad. Thanks Ale!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. But what is good food with bad service. Your spending a lot of money there for the waitress to ignore you. Maybe someone should tell them they get bigger tips if you're more attentive to your customers."}
{"text":"Came down to Vegas for the weekend with my boyfriend & since i had been here before but he hadn't i kept raving to him about how good the place was. We ordered a Molcajete Mixto, a Coctel De Camaron, & a Michelada. The food was good, i think it was better the first time i was there & the service was much faster the first time around too. The michelada was good the only bad thing was that the beer wasn't that cold & the michelada cup had no ice, so it was warm. & everyone knows warm beer isn't that tasteful. This place is already loud enough with all the people that go there since it is a somewhat popular marisco place, & they have musicians there playing spanish music at customers tables per there request ofcourse $$$. 
We had a good lunch, the only bad thing is that right next to our table was this ratchet B in booty shorts shaking her ass all over the place, dancing on her man, & the chair she was sitting on even hit the floor at one point. She made herself look super needy for attention especially at a FAMILY restaurant where there was families sitting around with kids. Not one person working there told her to sit her disrespectful ass down. They just stared at her waiting for her party to leave, the waiter even came up to us after they left & apologized to us which i thought was a nice gesture. Overall the food was okay, i know it could've been better. The music is good just a little too loud in there to be able to talk to the people you're with, you kinda have to raise your voice at each other. & our service was good too!"}
{"text":"If you are hungover and in Las Vegas you need to come here! It's about 20 minutes from the strip but I guarantee you it's worth the drive. 

The place is very colorful. The music is good and the service is more than great!

Let's talk about the food though. 

I had the aguachiles. This is my favorite Mexican seafood dish. The ones here are just so good. The perfect amount of lime and chile. They also give you a side of chile which I made sure to use. My mouth is watering just thinking about the taste. 

I also tried the shrimp ceviche and it was just as good! The serving size looks small but it's actually enough for about 3 tostadas. They give you a lot of shrimp. 

We also ordered 4 shrimp empanadas thinking they would be small but boy were we wrong. They were huge! It was only 2 of us and we would've been good with just 1 each. The waitress recommended we mix  mayo with the green chile sauce it comes with. Good thing we listened to her because it was amazing. 

We also had 2 refreshing micheladas. 

This place is a must when you're in Vegas! You won't regret it and you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm here visiting from LA for the weekend. Never been here, but let me tell you as busy as this place is the food and service are great! All the employees help each other out, to insure that the client is happy rather then having the mentality that a lot of rest have \"that's not my table!\" I will definitely visit here again. Great job to the managers / owners. I hope you take care of your staff the way they take care of you."}
{"text":"Oh come on! This place is supposed to be know for their seafood Nayarit style? I have been to Nayarit and to see this place so packed makes me wonder if anyone who dines here has ever had well prepared seafood dish. So disappointed in the 7 mares cocktail in plain water which no matter what we added to it tasted like it was someones first time making this dish, their pulpitos a la mantequilla(small octopus in butter sauce) was a waste of octopus I hope they are not extinct because this place is wasting what ought to be delicious product. 

The only thing worth this overpriced meal was the mariachi bands and I think this place is lucky to have them as this is what may be the only reason they are as busy as they are."}
{"text":"People talk so good about this place I've been wanting to go to this location so badly. I finally did today & ended up extremely disappointed! The food was mediocre! The price was through the roof and the service was horrible. I ordered camarones a la diabla which is a popular food choice in Mexican restaurants. I should have followed my gut. I even asked the server if it was a good choice because I got a bad feeling. She assured me It was good! When I received my plate the food was semi cold and the shrimp had no taste I also ordered an horchata which tasted like soap! My date ordered fried shrimp. Again what could go wrong with that? They were super dry and over fried.  This place is pricey so I felt bad for my date he basically threw his money away!"}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough. We were referred here by friends a couple years ago and have never looked back. Very Authentic.  Great Atmosphere.  Place is usually packed. And haven't tried anything there I haven't absolutely loved.  The shrimp empanadas are a MUST!  Best fish taco I've had in Vegas. Carne Asada & Fried Shrimp platter are fantastic."}
{"text":"Best place hands down for Mexican sea . It's a 15 min drive from downtown Vegas . one thing Id never like was Micholadas until a friend bought me one, I have to say they are BOMB!! .And you have to eat this , Id tried it and fell in love with there scallop tostada , and they have live music and plenty Of parking"}
{"text":"First time ever at this place, celebrating mother's day. The worst decision ever. Not only  super pricy but the food is not worth it. My mom asked for the Huachinango fish. Which is a whole fried fish. The fish was fried to point that she had use a steak knife to cut through it. Never mind mistakes can always happen. We politely complained to the waitress, which by the way it seems shes never been trained in customer service. She said she would tell the cook 15 to 20 min later she came and picked up the  fish, never asking if my mother wanted something else, or even apologizing. So pissed at service here. We paid about $170 at this place. My mom didnt even get to enjoy a decent meal. I wish I could give negative stars to this place. People here are careless and dont really care about their customer. Dont visit this place unless you want to be ripped off."}
{"text":"La comida esta buenisina buen servicio I las mangocheladas ni hablar the bomb.. Nuestra mesera fue Karla I nos dio muy buen customer service lo recomiendo :)"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch; ordered camarones a la diabla and camarones al mojo de ajo. The plate came out and I couldn't believe the portion, large white Mexican shrimp, probably 20 to 25 of them. The table salsa didn't have kick to it, so we ordered habanero salsa. The server was quick, friendly and attentive. Definitely coming back, thank you!"}
{"text":"First thing is first, do not come here with a hangover.
While the food will definitely satisfy and cure the hangover, the loud music will not.

Service:
For as busy as it was, especially on a post-vegas weekend Sunday, me and my party of five were quickly seated and orders were taken. We had our main server and then greeted and noticed by other ones too. The wait was 15 minutes or less. The staff was so friendly, and very attentive.

Food:
I ordered the Tacos de Pescado (fish tacos).
Not only did they NOT rob you on your 'fish' part of the tacos, it was the perfectly prepared. Topped off my tacos with their red salsa which is delicious, not too spicy!
Definitely a MUST-HAVE!

Environment:
If you love mariachis music and bright colorfulness, then definitely come here.
And since you're close to the people around you I do not recommend if you don't like people and loud music."}
{"text":"Les recomiendo la botana mixta :) trae un pokito de todo excelente para k coman una familia de 4."}
{"text":"The flood was good but pricy and you can't hear yourself because it's too loud. Live music is nice but not when the band is next to you and they don't even let you stand up because of the instruments..."}
{"text":"I love the feeling of the place when i walk in. Lots of windows with lots of seating. Food is always fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Even though this place is popular with tourists-in-the-know, don't be surprised if the whole restaurant turns around to watch you and your gringa friend get seated. This location is so much better than the one on the west side that they're virtually nothing alike aside from menu.

The shrimp empanadas are the main reason we came here, and they're the bomb- large pockets stuffed with shrimp or cheese, definitely a must-order item. I only wish they had shrimp AND cheese, the best of both worlds. The oysters preparadas (topped with ceviche) are another solid app to start with, super fresh and heaped with shrimp. The ceviches (the mixta is my favorite!) are also available as whole orders or on tostadas, which are better if you're dining solo. The rest of the menu is pages of plates with fish, shrimp, and fajitas prepared several different ways. 

Service is really friendly, though it may take a while to place an order because they are so busy. Daniel is great, request him if you can. If you go on a weekend, be sure to dine inside so you can hear the bandas and mariachis."}
{"text":"Wow, this is the best Mariscos in vegas... And I'm from Cali.. It's better than the Mariscos in Cali too... If you have a hangover, it's sooo worth the drive.. They have different live bands, mariachi, banda, conjunto norteno...  The food prices are reasonable and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is definitely the worse time ever at this restaurant, we're usually here every year in the month of November to celebrate my birthday and my Comadre's Birthday ( my best friend) food is good music is awesome our waiter was great but right before leaving, my Comadre went to the bathroom and I went in right behind her and watched her fall, Apparently someone had just moped the floor with some slippery chemical. I helped her up she hit her head pretty hard not to mention one whole side arm, hip and head. As soon as I helped her up I left her to get the Mgr. I ran into the our waiter and asked for the Mgr. I then went to the Mgr told him what happened and all he said was \"ok sorry about that\" he sent someone to place a wet floor sign as he continued to welcome people into Restaurant,  it was then when I said hey to the MGR?\" What is your name he said my name is Guadalupe, then why don't you care about what I just said? He proceeded to tell me that yes I do care that's why I sent someone to go see and put a wet floor sign ( of course after the fact). Point being he just did not care. I was very upset at the fact that he didn't even ask to see who fell to ask her how she was feeling. I did tell him that he was not fit to be a Mgr. and that I could not even believe that he didn't even want to check up on the customer. If the owner/s is reading this please train your personnel specially your mgrs. in how to deal with these type of situations. Because of the \" MGR \" we will no longer return. Personally I'm very disappointed in Guadalupes (mgr) reaction. Prove to us that you are a profesional business owner and do something about this please."}
{"text":"I have heard this is the place to go for Mexican seafood. And growing up, I saw this place as a Wimpys, then this place took over. Special memories since my grandma lived right behind here So after 20+ years I finally went. I got a to go order ... I was amazed at how fast I placed my order. I had the shrimp tacos. They were so good! But for the price I paid for these awesome tacos, I wish they included rice and beans! The most expensive tacos I ever had!! Mariachi City was fun to watch"}
{"text":"This place is not good at all. Tried there ceviche and it looked my 6 year prepared the tostada. I do not recommend this place at all. Prices are way to high for what you get. Say your money and time."}
{"text":"Came to vegas for the weekend and was told I should visit this place while at it. The service was great I'll give them that. However it's TOO loud and I hate having to repeat my order because the waitress couldn't hear me after screaming my order. I ordered the deep fried shrimp with a side of bland rice and flavorless beans. I came here with high hopes of good authentic food but left with food that tasted like my brother microwaved for me before. (Which wasn't good btw)"}
{"text":"I've been about a half dozen times for the food, which is pretty good.  Not superb, but pretty good... with your standard mariscos fare -- I seem to always get their campachana, but the fried tilapia is good, too.  

I discovered it about four years ago when I first came to Vegas as a tourist and didn't want to eat on the strip.

What is a treat are the mariachis who are here in abundance, especially on the weekend.  Reminds me of the affairs I used to see in East LA -- all locals all the time and families in abundance.

I was here once where I think they had no less than four FULL mariachi bands going one after another and typically they have at least one group playing, walking about.

It doesn't look like much on the outside, next to a small strip mall, and with nothing significant about it; but trust me... it's worth going to at least once."}
{"text":"The food is good, not the best. The atmosphere was fantastic due to the karaoke they had mu friends and I sang some songs then left. Definitely not going back because I had the worst Molcajete in town."}
{"text":"Opt for the cooked and grilled seafood items, the ceviches were not all that fresh. Menu is surprisingly expansive, with some healthy and low-carb options available. The molcajetes and the grilled fish platters are pretty popular here. 

Pricing is kind of all over the place: seafood can be pricey, but I didn't expect to see burritos around $11 and some meals without sides run you $15? There are also a couple of sushi rolls on the menu, but they seem to use cooked ingredients (fajitas?).

I like having the option to order the submarinos- a halved cucumber scooped out to form a boat, served filled with fish and shrimp ceviche and avocado slices. The portion is large and price is reasonable, ~$12, but the ceviche is not all that fresh and is lacking in flavor.

NOTE: Location interior is currently under construction, only debit and cash are accepted here."}
{"text":"First off, I will NEVERR go back. I always come here when visiting Vegas. The food itself is very good. My husband ordered shrimp al ajo which includes, rice, beans and a small little salad. He was done with most of his food and when he got to the salad, he noticed a hair in it. We let a waiter know who told us she would let our waiter know about it. Our waiter brought us the check without mentioning anything about the hair as I sat there waiting for an apology at the least! When she came back to take my debit card (still no apology), I asked her if the other waiter told her about the hair and with an attitude she goes \"do you want me to get you a new salad to go or what?\" I said No! All I'm looking for is at least an apology! She then stated the only thing she could do was get me a new salad to go! Ughhh soo disappointed!! Worstttt customer service ever! She was soo rude, she definitely was hungover or cant find another job elsewhere. (FYI it was a Monday morning and the place was emptyyyyy). Will be looking for my receipt to update this post with her name"}
{"text":"Some of these reviews are ridiculous. Just stupid. A bad review because the place was empty? Who cares?! A bad review because of service? Our service was amazing. There was a language barrier and our server did her best to communicate. This is an AUTHENTIC PLACE so if you're going there expecting hoity toity American service don't go! If you're expecting authentic Mexican mariscos and service with a smile this is your place! The food was the best in Vegas. The micheladas were amazing, and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I gave one star cause I had to but this place is by far the worst!!!  Never go here!! 
Food is not good at ALL!!!!!! We literally walked out after tasting the food. Horrible!!!!!!!!!! 

Waitress had no customer service skills! 

DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best mariscos I have ever had, but far from the worst.  The tostada mixta was off the hook and I appreciated the fact that it wasn't swimming in juice because I like to taste the seafood and not just lime.  The michelada was eh, and the shrimp cocktail was average.  The food is pricey, but then again they aren't next to the ocean so I can see why they would need to cover their costs.  The service is good and they have live mariachi/banda on Sunday's."}
{"text":"The micheladas are really good.  They have mariachi and live music.

Considering this is a seafood spot, my shrimp didn't taste too fresh.  I had the tequila shrimp.

It was cool as a one time experience, but I wouldn't come back.."}
{"text":"The spicy shrimp dish (do not recall the name) and ceviche over oysters are absolute musts!! Everyone seemed to have ceviche on their table so definitely trying that next this as well."}
{"text":"Me and my gf were looking for some good seafood and we found this place everything was good until our food arrive to our table I had some plain fish tacos no taste with 2 cold tortillas and one strip of fish she had shrimp ala cucaracha style they were so dry with really spicy on The side guacamole plain service bad hopefully they do better after this but ain't going back to this place no more"}
{"text":"So my Review is a little late... Like a week late, but better late then never, right? I've dined here two times with the gf and within the two different times, We've had two different experiences ( try saying that 5x LOL) from the customer service to the way the food tasted ...

First time - Walked in and stood there for a couple minutes until a waitress shouted \" pick where you wanna sit\" uh ok.... We sat down and we had the choice of booth or table, so we chose a table, and then after a couple minutes our waitress finally greeted us with very bland Chips y Salsa starter .We were  asked if we wanted a beverage ... \"Of course we did right?\" ... GF and I both chose Preparadas and they were by far the tastiest and better than B. Michoacan * cough...  We ordered the most amazingly prepared Guacamole y chips ! The chips were deep fried and flaky and the guacamole was the perfection of the right ratio of onion and lime, and strangely it was topped with a cheese... I'm thinking it could've been Oaxaca (not sure) but it was damn good .. Oh and we both shared the Submarinos - shrimp and fish ceviche inside a hollowed out cucumber, 2 per order. It was just enough for both of us . We saved room for dessert and ordered Churros con Nieve (ice cream) the Churros were okay :/ not the best but not the worst ( they were filled with cajete & chocolate ) and the ice cream was .. Well it was ice cream ?  I give it a 3/5 

Now ... 


Second time-  Gf ordered a Preparada and I got a MANGOCHELADA oh my ! It was prepared like a Chelada but it had mango pieces and a tamarindo straw- it was amazzing! We shared the Guacamole, but this time it was way off, it needed salt, lime and more onion. It was a totally different dish from the first experience . The chips y salsa were a little better, it wasn't so gringo this time. Sorry :/  then lastly we ordered just the \"ceviche de camaron \" and it was great.. We skipped dessert this time .. 

Overall .. Food was good, better than most places in town, drinks are GREAT., but work on the customer service and making people feel welcomed & not rushed .. Both times were different so I'm sticking to 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Ive been here a few times already. The food is extremely delicious. Portions are amazing. Cant stress this enough! So many other sea food places ive been to that I order something with shrimp and i get like 4 pieces...
But NOT This place! They don't joke around with the serving sizes and that makes everything so yummy! Service also good. This place is 5 stars consistently! Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"BAD service, TERRIBLE food, EXPENSIVE prices. Ordered a mocajete de mariscos. The crab legs literally did not have any meat. Ordered extra octopus and I had to fish the teeny tiny bit of them out. Overall the dish was flavorless. I waited until after paying the bill to tell our waiter about the terrible dish because obviously she did not cook it. She agreed, yet did not offer an apology or anything at all. Lol so horrible. Do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 7 years everytime I visit Vegas. Great place to cure your hangover after a wild night at the strip...Seafood is delicious as well as their carne asada plate. Service is good. Expect a wait for a table when it is crowed. Live music is ok. Try the shrimp consome, best cure for that hangover (i.e., have it while you are waiting for your food, it comes in a small cup), you will be alive!"}
{"text":"The complementary tortilla chips were stale and the salsa was just ok. 
I ordered the shrimp quesadilla and it was mediocre. The shrimp weren't deveined which kinda grossed me out. I ended up not eating 95? of my plate."}
{"text":"there was a roach in my good eww


I can't believe this waitress took 4 ever then when I got my food had a roach . Gross 

we ended up trying the place across the street way better"}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican seafood. It's kinda pricey, but you can taste the quality of the ingredients. The decor reminds me of places I've eaten at in TJ and Ensenada. I recommend this place. I'm a regular."}
{"text":"It was good ! Not a big fan of the random ppl coming up to the table trying to sell us a little bit of everything !"}
{"text":"Coming from la where you can go anywhere and have some good seafood places,I've been in Vegas for four months I've try a place call talapa,and chamizal can't really call those places good ceviche nasty michelada really....so I had given up on looking for Marisco place until I saw this commercial on tv about this place Las Islitas Mariscos Estilo Nayarit..I ask the guy if it was the same someone he said no..but I still didn't hesitate he was really friendly and very nice attitude I'll give him 5 stars..so I had a michelada with modelo very freaking delicious from the glass to the drink...I also had the ceviche Casero de Camaron...bomb,delicious I fell in love with this food and place..I know now to keep on coming here"}
{"text":"Asked if they had carne asada burritos. Said \"Yes...$6 each, but you had to order 3.\" Thought, \"Fine, I'll have one for lunch.\"..Got home and opened box and there were 3, all about the size of a Snickers bar?...guess they specialize in seafood. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Simple the best!... if you know about mexican seafood flavors then you will agree by simple, quality, fresh and generous portions. 
 I try about 10 to 15 restaurants here in las vegas but still think this is the best \"hands down\". From high end to \"hole in the walls restaurant\". Service alway quick and friendly. Try the fish ceviche, steam shrimp, fresh oysters, and of course shrimp empanadas, if you are a big eater then try the campechana soup or the pescado zarandeado.. \"please dont go to this place to order tacos or steaks that will be an insult to your palate\" cheers..."}
{"text":"I love love their seafood here.  Even their empanadas were off the chain.  I love coming here.  Great atmosphere and great vibe.  The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Don't you hate it when you find those few restaurants that after you ask yourself \"would you come back again\", your only response is .... \"I don't know\"?

There's only one reason why I don't know if I'll come back though. They overdo it with the lemons on their cooked dishes. It's overkill to dress just about every dish with lemons. Certain raw dishes do require it, and that's fine. That's what Mariscos are all about: yummy raw seafood cured and drenched in lemon juice. However,  I found that even the cooked dishes were unnecessarily swimming in lemon juice. 

For instance, I ordered shrimp saut√©ed in a red chilli sauce that Satan himself down in sin city could have prepared. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/E6DmUAHfSRCEakvknot-zA?select=LCDJ1xqpSrDdy_xV5K3DOw#O9dSsy8KKzMZAgAGDH6iBQ Then I tasted it and.... bummer. It was sour. This was where I drew the line.

But then the good stuff: the raw dishes were really great. The shrimp and fish ceviches were above average http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/E6DmUAHfSRCEakvknot-zA?select=LCDJ1xqpSrDdy_xV5K3DOw#fEJ1DBMFRavlRSnReW_YIA , and the standout dish of the night was the Shrimp Aguachile, or raw shrimp with fresh jalape√±os.cured in lemon juice. 

Drinks were good, live Mariachi music was great... wait that's right. They have a LIVE MARIACHI.

Ok, I'm going back.

{"text":"The food was great and it was worth the price. We came all the ways from Hawaii in July of 2015 and it's was just an amazing experience at the Islitas Restaurant.
 
TOO AUTHENTIC I JUST LOVED IT!

FINAL JUDGEMENT
5 STARS---Customer Friendliness 
5 STARS---Taste of Food
5 STARS---Restaurant Appeal
4.5 STARS-Pricing (High but when you consider the taste it's worth it)
4 STARS---Cleanse 

RATING AVERAGE: 4.7 STARS but I'll round it off and give the 5 it deserves."}
{"text":"A group of 13 of us went on a Sunday afternoon. This place was packed! While we waited outside there was a person selling micheladas. Very much needed after a night of partying and waiting in the heat. We waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated. The service was good considering how busy it was. This is a perfect spot to hang out with friends, enjoy live music and eat good sea food. 

It's about a 15 minute drive from the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Traditional ceviche Mexican restaurant. In these places the service is not always great but the food tends to taste  just right. I had fish tacos and a ceviche tostadas."}
{"text":"OMG!!! The food was so delicious and the options were way too generous. Michiladas were perfect and the guacamole was awesome. Very Authentic taste! Pictures is what we couldn't finish only because it was so much food."}
{"text":"I ate here with my boyfriend a long time ago before I started doing reviews on yelp. I ordered a huge seafood type dish that came in a sauce . When I started eating I noticed a long black straight hair in my food. I'm blond. I was so grossed out and refused to eat it.Even though I didn't eat it they made us pay for the meal. I complained to the manager . But they didn't do anything. They totally suck. They got 8 demerits ftom the health district in February 2017 for being gross. Go check the Southern Nevada Health District for yourself. I recommend doing so before going to any restaurant. I do not recommend this restaurant at all. It's obvious they have nasty people working there."}
{"text":"We always come to this place when we Visit Las Vegas from California. They sale the best micheladas and the food itself it's amazing. I always get the Camarones enpanisados. Bomb.com"}
{"text":"The food was only so-so. The fish was too fishy, the beef too dry, the chips too stale. Overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Came back to this place yesterday and noted a few things...

We ordered different food/drinks this time. We got the shrimp ceviche which was good but the shrimp had a really weird texture to it...it wasn't firm the way cooked shrimp is but it had the consistency of clams. It was just weird. We also ordered the chips and guac again and the guac tasted off to me....we added a whole lime and salt to it and it was still just okay. Definitely a downgrade since the first time we went.

The salsa improved thankfully - I actually enjoyed it this time but the chips are still so stale that it hurt to bite into one at times. 

My GF got the Mangochelada which was AMAZING. It's a preparada with mango pieces and a tamarindo straw. I will definitely get that the next time I'm in.

We got a different waitress this time and service was good, which I was happy about so I decided to keep the rating because though some things were improved, others declined. The first time we went the food was amazing but the service sucked; this time the service was great but the food wasn't up to par. There doesn't seem to be a happy medium."}
{"text":"Excellent food and got excellent service. Definitely coming back here when I'm in Vegas. A little loud but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"They were out of several things on their menu. Beer was warm and they didn't have two types of beer on hand. I asked for a mango michelada and they said they didn't have it either. There was food on the floor were we got sat at, and the table was dirty. Overall bad experience. I was with a group of 7 and we all shared the same experience."}
{"text":"Best ceviche ever and the zarrandeado delicious love this place come here everytime i come"}
{"text":"Se tardaron 20 minutos para darnos una mesa y nomas apuntaron donde y cuando fuimos a la mesa no habia sufficiente espacion para sentarnos todos. I had to ask someone else for a chair. Then they brought out the wrong order I order ceviche de pescado and the brought de camaron. Then they forgot to bring out one of our tostadas literally we had to ask. The ceviche de pescado wasn't even good it was bitter like they used old lemons. The fish tacos have no sauce or dressing. The tostada mixta was just plain with no verdura. Y para cabarla de chingar they charged us wrong so they had to give us money in cash cause they charged to much on the card. Not worth the hype. Food isn't that great. Don't recommend it."}
{"text":"First time here, meeting a few friends. Great atmosphere with mariachi music blasting, goes well with a few Coronas. I recommend coming with a group."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying I don't eat sea food so my eating is based on the carne asada plate with rice and beans. I know this is a sea food place but I mean how could a Mexican place not have good carne asada. The asada had no flavor, the rice and beans had no flavor either. The meat was burnt... I could taste burnt...nothing else. They were fast in serving our food but I just didn't care for te plate. You would think their rice or beans would be good but it's not the case."}
{"text":"The ceviche here was awesome!!! I didn't like the tacos de asada. The meat was really dry!

I recommend coming here for the seafood -only!"}
{"text":"Cool hangout spot. Cool ambience. I enjoyed the musicians. But the food is way overpriced. The food is average, I've had better. Service was bad."}
{"text":"Love this spot I like the Empanada and appetizers are off the hook I always stop to eat here when in Vegas."}
{"text":"So much good food. The live music was good and so was the atmosphere. Good prices and again the food was amazing. We're from out of town, found this place on yelp and decided to give it a shot. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time we come to vegas we have to stop by. Great seafood, ambiance, and the micheladas are good too;) Great service as well. Our waitress name is Letty, she took very good care of us!"}
{"text":"Fell in love with this place! Loved everything about it. The ONLY thing that I wasn't too happy about is that they do not sell any other alcoholic beverage other than beer. I hate beer but that's besides the point. Everyone else there though seemed to enjoy their Micheladas (the ones you drink to cure a hangover). It is the perfect place to go for sunday brunch... I had heard about this place and made it a point to visit the next time I was in Vegas. There are other locations in Vegas from the same chain of restaurants but THIS ONE is the one you have to try. If you're into Mexican food & music... you'll like this place. Haha we liked it so much we got there at 1 pm and didn't leave 'till 8 PM!! yup... 7 hrs! My friends & I love listening to Banda, Mariachi and Conjunto music... this place has all 3. Agarramos el conjunto por un buen rato! Buena parranda que nos metimos. While my friends all got tipsy (the like beer) I had to be the sober one, BUT I had an amazing time. The food was great too. The decor of the place is pretty cool. Cannot wait to go back. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! me and my boyfriend went on a vacation to Las vegas (we are from Cali) and after a crazy weekend came a hangover and what better way to cure that hangover than with mariscos and a michelada. we went on a sunday it was a bit crowded the wait was about 15minutes (but worth it) service was awesome &the food my goodness i wanna say a bit better tasting than the places I have  been to here in Cali the shrimp was bigh lol. we 1st tryed the oysters preparados, we also had camarones envenedados, and camarones en mantequilla both plates were DELISHIS!! this place is located about 20mins from the vegas strip and a must try."}
{"text":"Really good food the seafood was delicious... But don't go there on weekends a lot of people was waiting just to get a table it was full the restaurant, but the wait is worth a really tasting food. The staff is very friendly.. Well I recommend to go here..."}
{"text":"Nasty. Food no. Flavor and over price .... don't waist ur time and. Ur money. Go some where better"}
{"text":"Great food ate aguachiles and camarones a la diabla. Ask for the hotter green hot sauce if you like spicy foods. Upbeat mariachi and trio were both good. Will be back maypac weekend."}
{"text":"I called ahead of time to ask how late they were opened and they said 10pm. I got a cab from the strip and got there at 9:50pm and no one was there anymore. They should stick to their own hours of operation. Almost $60 on cab fair"}
{"text":"Food is good but a bit over priced just like their other locations. This place is really loud & you won't be able to carry on a conversation. This is more of a bar than a restaurant, 90% of people are drinking and guys are perves. If you're a female Don't go by yourself if you don't wanna be bugged."}
{"text":"Went here right before going back home from our vegas trip and everything was amazing. Their empanadas and tostada mixta pretty good. I ordered the camarones patron ohh so good. The waitress was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. Very good place. Make sure to stop by before heading home."}
{"text":"Came here after a night of partying. Omg the micheladas are delicious. The food is great. They have Banda playing today. Service is great."}
{"text":"Our experience here was not as good as everyone else's. I had to practically make my coctel de camar√≥n. They bring me all the ingredients separate to put in. Still with half the bottle of ketchup and tapatio it had NO FLAVOR. It was also pretty pricey. I won't be going there next time we're in vegas."}
{"text":"So good best thing I had all week during my visit! A must try - Michelada's are served in a foam to go soup container while you wait,  so for me -  wait is worth it even in the heat."}
{"text":"Super yummy and did not disappoint! Huge selection of meals including seafood as well.  Everything was served perfectly and with generous portion sizes.  All servers were very attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"I went here about two years ago with my nephew and some friends and the food was decent our waitress was simply amazing she was very friendly, wholesome and cute!! The restaurant's decor was rather plain, nothing impressive.  it was a huge room with tables and chairs.  I remember going to this place based on a recommendation from a drunken local.  I am planning to return to this place in couple of weeks at that time I will truly be able to rate this restaurant accordingly.  Las islitas are in the in the central coast of Mexico in the state of Nayarit.  A native dish of Nayarit is pescado sarandeado!!! it is an extremely delicious fish that is slowly cooked over burning wood chips.  This restaurant serves it.  Since on our first visit they were about to close they were unable to prepare this fish for us!!! I can hardly wait!!! I am not expecting it to taste the same as the one I had in my hometown in Nayarit, but if it gets somewhat close I will be ecstatic!!!

3/16/08 
Was there this weekend and I returned to this seafood Nayarit style restaurant.  The infamous pescado sarandeado was good, but I don't believe I will be changing my rating.....This restaurant continues to be a 3 star, and I continue on my journey to find great pescado sarandeado.  No BEER!!! Mexican seafood with no beer????"}
{"text":"I have had my fair share of Mariscos and this was by far the worst place I had been to.  Not only was the food horrible and tasteless but it took 50 minutes to get our food served. I understand that this was a busy weekend but the Resteraunt should have been better prepared with more than just two servers. 

I DO NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place from the outside is so rich and famous but when you try the food you definitely throw up. Only the two stars I am giving them for the service. They run this business with garbage food with lame ass setting inside. Kids meal came from Costco food as you seen and all the other food may be heat up on the microwave."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Ceviche de Cameron was good. The fish tacos were alright a bit to dry. The shrimp tacos were the only good part about my visit. The waitress messed up on the whole order but did offer free desert."}
{"text":"This place is just all hype 
They should consider sending the cooks to some type of culinary school 
I've had better cockteles de camaron off some lunch trucks"}
{"text":"I was SO EXCITED TO GO HERE!!!
What a total disappointment. 

The band playing in the dining room was SO LOUD we asked to move our table to a remote part of the dining room, just so we could speak to each other with out screaming. 

The food came, and I LOVE Mexican food, I love Mexican style seafood even more, I seriously love it! But everything was bland, needed spice, we were a flurry of salting, peppering, squeezing limes, dabbing hot sauces, ketchup. ANYTHING to give this flavorless food some flavor. We sent stuff back, barely ate what we ordered. SO SAD!
And it was not cheap!

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Our hotel was in the strip and drove to this restaurant for a michelada. They were really simple but so good because we've been hunting for one the whole time we were in Vegas. I get my with Bohemia and my boyfriend gets it with Negra."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I always make sure to stop by when we're in Las Vegas. Love their ceviche casero and shrimp empanadas! Had their oysters and they were also really yummy. And of course had to have a michelada too!"}
{"text":"I love going to the restaurant with friends and family the food is really good customer service is always excellent never had a problem with that it's just a little overpriced compared to the competitors it does have some of the best food but again the price is just sometimes too much for the portions of food I get"}
{"text":"Don't leave Las Vegas without going to this place! Great food, reasonable prices, live music, great service."}
{"text":"Best food in town if u a real Mexican !! and love Banda & mariscos !! I had the poison camarones give it a 10 !! I'm from sj ca and the his Islitas is way better the customer service is the best ! The owner in las Islitas in San Jose ca is rude stuck up and gives a horrible service when u complain she says she doesn't care that she has enough customers !! However Las Vegas Blvd location is the best !!! Even tho their packed they try their best to serve their customers!! That's important to me!! My husband had tacos gobernadores they were amazing!! Also recommended!!"}
{"text":"The service was probably the worst I have ever experienced. Most of the food that our group got was undercooked and had no flavor and our micheladas were watered down. When we notified the waiter about this problem and asked to speak to the manager he mentioned that the manager would not come to talk to us so we should be content if he gave us 2 free beers for a party of 10. A customer should always come first in any type of service sector, needless to say this problem was not resolved properly."}
{"text":"Food is insanely good... They have great selection and variety in their menu. They have live music as well. Service was great. The only bad thing is that it's really far from the strip. So prepare to pay for a $30+ taxi fare to get here. Totally worth it tho."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I've been here several times ans would visit often if I lived closer. They serve traditional mexican mariscos. The food is fresh, good and the service is pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"Wow I am so glad I decided to eat lunch here with my boyfriend. We came on a Thursday afternoon and we loved it! I ordered the lemonade and it came In a big margarita glass which I thought was so cute. I ordered two Mangonados for my love and I. They were so good! I asked the waitress and she told me it had mango juice and chili in it. So refreshing it didn't even taste like beer. We asked for the lunch special menu which is so worth it! I ordered the Camarones rancheras. Shrimp empanadas to start and my boy ordered the steak chimichanga. The food is a 10. The rice and beans were authentic and so good. The green salsa that comes with the shrimp empanadas is spicy but gave the empanadas a better flavor. The chimichanga came with a small hot sauce on the side and it was also really good. The interior of this place is super cute with paintings on the wall and Banda music playing in the back. I felt at home here. They have live banda on the weekends I would definitely be checking that out"}
{"text":"Good food and good drinks. This was a Mexican seafood restaurant that had some authentic quality and flavor. We ordered oysters on the half shel, ceviche and shrimp cocktails. All the food was good and I got full so I was pretty content. They had a mariachi group walking around playing just for you if you paid them. 
I would have given this place more stars but I thought they were a bit pricey especially being several miles away from the strip or Fremont street. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Best seafood ever! Everytime I am in vegas, this restaurant is a must. The ceviche is delicious."}
{"text":"I really really had to step back and re-evaluate my previous review! Why? It's simple, no place that is actually deserving of a zero star review would I ever crave for days, weeks, or even months post review! With that said this place is simply one of the best Mexican seafood restaurants I know! I'll admit I will never attempt to use as much as a gift card here again, but that comes with some places, right? Some things you figure out and just don't fight! Simple! 

To the food! 

Oh my lord, the shrimp empanadas are an experience of their own! I came here with a group of friends and tried them a couple of years ago and that's all they raved about! Now when I invite anyone here or recommend anything, the shrimp empanadas are at the top of my list! 
At first bite you experience the crispy exterior, light but not too much breading, the inside packed.. no BURSTING with shrimp filling (not that mix of fillings from all around the kitchen, no this is all shrimp baby), and just flavor flavor flavor! The other meal I get here that's just unbelievably awesome is the shrimp enchiladas! The sauce is like a creamy tomato sauce, really inexplicable, but damn good! They top them with a delicious salad that  I can't help but make sure I get a bit of in every bite and it's served with refried beans and rice! 

Overall you will love this place, the food, the ambiance, the band, and the people really make you feel welcome! Just don't try to use a restaurant.com certificate when your starving! Haha... seriously don't!"}
{"text":"Place was about to close let me and my coworkers in. Food and service are insane. Fish and shrimp ceviche are a must."}
{"text":"Love the ceviche from here !! The shrimp empanadas the salsa omg yummy ! The shrimp n chicken fajitas   great place with great food love the music ."}
{"text":"I love this place. I went back for lunch today with a friend. Enjoyed empanadas de Camaron com salsa verde and some yummy fish tacos. It's a must if you happen to be in North Las Vegas"}
{"text":"To much noice you can't really enjoy a meal since they let mariachis and bands play at same time, place is not larch enough plus like 10 tvs playing all at same time, service is good food is good place is nice colorful, but to much noice at same time.
Not a good thing.
3 stars  for food and sevice
 0 estars for 
Non enjoyable with to much music noice."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place in Vegas! The food is really good and the seafood is fresh. I try to make it here every time I come to Vegas and normally come with a large group. We have learned to call beforehand and make reservations and get seated pretty much upon arrival. This last time we got the best spot in the restaurant because aside from their usual Mexican musicians that play upon hire by customers, they had an awesome Banda that surrounded our table. Perfect way to to celebrate Mexican Independence Day wknd! As far as the food and drinks, my personal favorites are the micheladas, empanadas and ceviche! Yum, yum, yum! I wish we had an Islitas in the East Bay."}
{"text":"I'm a huge mariscos lover and oh mah gawd.. I love this place. I live in Cali and come to Vegas maybe once or twice a year. I've never came to Vegas and not came here. Micheladas are insanely delicious and the shrimp ceviche is the best I've ever had. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Venimos a pasear de los angeles y quisimos probar algo diferente pero la comida de ac√° no nos gust√≥ despu√©s de esperar casi media hora el servicio muy malo..mi esposo pidi√≥ tacos de pescado y estaban horribles la mesera le prometi√≥ una salsa y nunca apareci√≥ con ella yo ped√≠ un veracruzano y la verdad no me gusto..no volvemos a regresar a este lugar..los precios est√°n bien altos y para pagar x una mala comida. No vale la pena.."}
{"text":"Super delicious sea food nice place super customer service I will be coming back. And they were filming a music video and even at that point they were awesome !!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst mariscos restaurant that we have ever been to! I would of gave 0 stars if I could..that's how bad it was. The service was terrible, the food wasn't great, I got my food last when the rest of my party was already half way done & only because I said something (it was a shrimp cocktail-the easiest plate out of all). The food had no flavor, we had to put a bunch of seasoning on all of our plates and our drinks were super watered down! The price is way too high, I understand that it is seafood but it was not worth it! Our server was rude & did not want to split our check 4 ways. She said only if we paid with cash she would split it..but it was only because she didn't want her tip on card to be deducted or be less because they included the tip in the check already. It was seriously such a bad experience that we will never come here again! We are only visitors but come to Las Vegas pretty often & after a night of drinking a good seafood place is exactly what you need, but do not come to this place! A taco stand on the strip would of been 100 times better. We are so disappointed because we waisted a good amount of money of worthless service and food! The ONLY good thing about this place was the mariachis and the grupo! We definitely DO NOT recommend this place! Save your hard earned money!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on wednesday arouns 4pm. It was dead inside the restaurant...only 4 tables were filled. We ordered the mango cheladas and muchelada. They were good but a bit pricey for $10 each. For lunch we ordered half dozen the ostiones preparadas (raw oysters topped w shrimp ceviche) great presentation but lacked flavor. The oysters were NOT FRESH. I can tell by just eating one, but then again what do you expect, you're in the middle of the desert away from the ocean. I just ordered just cuz i was curious if they have fresh ones. We also ordered the shrimp ceviche, again very pricey but good portion and also the tacos governador (marinated shrimp and cheese in grilled double tortilla taco) it was okay but too sweet and they seem to use IMITATION cheese. Yes. I am a cheese eater but their cheese didnt taste like cheese and i know it was those giant cheap imitation mozarella bags. Service was ok. Not bad but not good either. Just average. Live music on the weekends and it can get really packed in the weekends. (This was our 3rd visit). Our check came out tp $71.36 for 2 people. Not cheap."}
{"text":"Really good service. Food was the best first time coming here and yes I will come again and I will recommend it. Live music too mariachi Banda or grupo norte√±o the best."}
{"text":"This place has good food but the service is very slow. When I walked in there were only a few tables seated but it still took a while before we got a waiter to ask for drink orders and the food took at least 35 minutes for a table of 3 to arrive. When we were finished we had to waive down a waitress from other tables bc our waiter hadn't stopped by since dropping of the food 20 min earlier. They charge for everything like water and refills and they provide you disposable plates, cups and utensils and for the price you pay you would expect so much more."}
{"text":"We were on our Vegas trip and my brother in law had heard about this place. Staff is really friendly. Let me tell you about the food we all got seafood and it had a lot of seafood. We were super happy for the portion of food that we got and it was inexpensive. Oh and let me tell you. That place gets super busy. Good thing we got there before they got slammed."}
{"text":"If you are on the SW side of town, in Spring Valley there is a restaurant called Las Islitas Mariscos that is owned by the same management. Both have delicious micheladas but the service lacks a bit at both restaurants. Ceviche and shrimp empanadas are good as well!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times for dinner.  On Friday night there was a couple of sets of musicians playing.  So we got live music all night.  AWESOME! 
The food is always good."}
{"text":"Not good, the food is very flavorless. I added salt lemon and more lemon. Still not good it was not good i got the mix tostadas. Plus they were huge. One would have been enough i told lady if she can take the other one back just cause it is was going to be thrown away I was on the road and cant leave shrimp out she said no. So bad customer service."}
{"text":"Overpriced? Yes... wait times for food are bad, so keep that in mind when coming. Service is friendly but absolutely no peace while eating. ... there was a clown, a guy selling flowers, a girl selling cds, mariachi and banda... food is average and overpriced."}
{"text":"Me and my mother and sister love love love this place! My mother is the Spanish speaker so we can't go with out her. But truly incredible food i love the deablo pasta and the cucumber civiche and the mango michilada just love it! If you don't like loud family feel restaurant this isn't for you because it feels when you go to a family's house for dinner. We love everything on the menu and we will continue to come back"}
{"text":"This place is really good. The food is great. Seafood is fresh and they have good  micheladas. Its a very busy restaurant but their service is great. They brought us drinks outside while we waited to be seated. Definitely recommend this place if u are ever in Las Vegas with or without a hangover."}
{"text":"Food is ok fish ceviche not good. Ir was more a pur√©.
But service was bad. Too slow, it was not even busy to be that slow. We ordered tacos dorados de camaron. We got tacos de pescado.
It took forever to receive The check. 
Not coming back"}
{"text":"One of our clinic attendings raved about this place, so I decided to check it out with a friend for dinner one evening when we returning from a trip north (since this is pretty far north in North Las Vegas).

The entrance is quite extravagant, and the interior is quite colorful and spacious. There are definitely some English-speaking servers, though the vast majority of patrons were Spanish-speaking. 

It was pretty loud during our whole entire meal, which made conversation somewhat difficult. I'm all for a lively atmosphere, but at one point, there were two separate mariachi bands in the restaurant playing simultaneously, which was confusing and the sounds definitely clashed.

As for the food, the food was tasty, and they have a huge menu with a lot of unique offerings. Portions are fairly big, but the food is also VERY pricey. I know seafood is expensive, but it still seemed a bit high. Prepare to spend a decent amount of money for a meal here.

It seems like a fun place, but I don't know that it was amazing enough for me to make another trek up north for a second visit."}
{"text":"Gets super packed and super loud. It's like battle of the bands in there.  It's a bit pricey but worth every dollar.  Can't go wrong with anything you order from the menu.  I would go more with seafood cocktails, fish tacos, and the Oysters."}
{"text":"Would have so enjoyed it more if during our conversation we did not have to scream to each other to be heard. We made the mistake of going on a late afternoon Saturday, between the blaring jukebox so loud that it made your ears almost bleed and the even louder mariachis playing in between the jukebox music, we couldn't even enjoy our meal. Don't think we will be back, although the food was good, it isn't worth the risk of going deaf!"}
{"text":"Hangover heaven.... The my---cheladas are so good.. Very well prepared.. Had some others to start.. Since my appetite was not there yet it hit the spot. Its worth the drive and the wait... Oh ya there's a wait. This place is packed.... Lots of drinkers in Vegas...."}
{"text":"Awwww MAN!!! I have written a review on their Pecos and Washington location, which I love and obsess about during the summer when craving sea food. However, felt like this location is lacking that \"touch\". I ordered the shrimp ceviche and fish tacos and they were definitely not as flavorful as they are at their north town location. The ceviche tasted way too fishy, needed lots of lemon and salt and the tacos where just blah!  

The restaurant itself is nice. Waitress was nice and attentive, just didn't get the same experience. The people I was with also agreed as they have also tried the other location. I will not be coming back to this location, especially because the prices have increased but worth it if you get the \"Islitas\" experience. This place does not have it. Go to north Las Vegas location. They are overpriced for the quality. I give them 3 starts only because I know they have potential on improving, or else I would give them 2."}
{"text":"I been a customer of this place for about 10 years every year in September we go to Las Vegas and our first stop after getting our rental car is always been this place, well let me told you that this year I was very dissatisfied with the service we got, the food was very bland my wife order fish ceviche and after we all got our food the server tells my wife \" oh I'm sorry the ceviche is not ready yet they making it as we speak\" so she didn't get her food until we were almost finish, I'll give it another try on our next year trip I hope they improve and the owner needs to be friendly he never smiles, let me tell you owner don't take your customers for granted and you need to bring the mariachi bands on the week days again"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS DISGUSTING!! i have no idea how it has good reviews. the food waste tasteless as if it was old. i just cant explain how bad it was!!!! THE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE... RUDE WAITRESS!!!! THEY IGNORED MY FAMILY AND I, my mom had to walk up and yell for something to get the check.. DISGUSTING.. DO NOT GO HERE.. You have a better chance at going to Robertos to get Better mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, my first time there. They had two Conjunto Norte√±os and Mariachi. I don't drink beer but tried their Mango Michelada and it was delicious, need to go back for another one. I had the shrimp & cheese tacos and they were very tasty, I think they are called Imperador. We went on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait about 30 minutes. It was worth the wait. I'm very picky and I can say I will be back to this restaurant every time I go to Vegas, it's a must stop visit."}
{"text":"ay caramba! where do I start..... 
It all started because of a nasty tasting can of Budweiser of CHELADA, (beer of choice with lemon, salt clamato and spicy stuff) and this place was recommended because they have the best....well they do!! Here we go: 

-TIME 
Fast and courteous with beautiful Spanish accents sneaking through their English words, the waitresses were prompt and kept checking on us from time to time, we certainly kept them busy. 
-TASTE 
This is where I have issues, My friend had the 7 mares and stated it was good I wouldn't know because I stay away from crab, the Alambres were a bit salty but the rice and beans were delicious, keep in mind that rice and beans are always a big failure in most restaurants, the beans here are fresh and so its the rice, nothing was from a can or a box, awesome! 
I ordered a dozen of raw oysters and they were semi fresh, obviously we are in the middle of the desert so I wont expect much... they were OK. 
Here is where I saw a major failure: the Fish Ceviche, I expected the usual ceviche that is chopped but theirs was mashed up, the waitress explained that it was Nayarit style but I'm not convinced, it was like canned tuna with lime juice, no major flavor. The tortillas are not made on site by hand, they are store bought, I believe that is a major fail in a big Mexican restaurant, also they were not tasty. 
THE CHELADA: the main reason why I came here, it was great!! I would go back just for that! I ordered it with a Victoria beer (recently they just started importing it from Mexico) the spice/salt on the glass rim was just right with the perfect amount of clamato....the whole thing was refreshing. 
THE FLAN!!! omg I almost forgot about this awesome oven baked flan, it was creamy and sweet...I highly recommend it!
-CLEANLINESS 
As clean as a busy restaurant can be, the salsa bottles on the table needed to be wiped other than that the place its old but well maintained. 

-THE RUNDOWN 
A bit pricey for the quality of food, good atmosphere, a bit noisy sometimes I couldn't speak to my friend on the other side of the table due to the high volume music on the speakers. They do play the Soccer games on TV so that's a plus if you like Soccer, beer and a good time. 
I would go back for the Cheladas."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this restaurant but it's terrible now . The service was terrible the food was no good. Everyone in my party of 6 complained about something that was wrong with their food, either overcooked or wasn't the way they ordered it. The only thing that was good was guacamole  and green salsa. We ordered items that were never brought to us and even when we reminded the waitress twice for an item she still didn't bring it to us . the only reason I Give It 2 Stars instead of one is because of the guacamole  and green salsa and they have occasional live band that is semi ok.."}
{"text":"My husband took me to this place for a date. I felt like I was in Mexico! There were live mariachi band and balloon clown. It was packed during the whole time we were there. Food was very decent. We had shrimp chiveche and oysters on shell. They both tasted fresh. There were also several tv on wall showing ball games like sports bar. Overall, this is a very cute Mexican Seafood restaurant with full of energy. I would like to bring more friends and family here to have true Mexican dinning experience."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Menu has a great variety, ceviche style is delicious, and the empanadas are packed with shrimp. Staff was attentive and courteous. Woman's bathroom was very clean. Only bad thing was the chips and salsa. I expected a better quality and spicier salsa for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"So fun, so tasty! Came here for my good friend's birthday this past weekend and I'm so glad I finally got to visit this talk-of-the-town seafood joint.

Although it is a bit pricy, you're getting fresh food and hearty portions... (Truthfully, the experience in itself is worth it! But I'll get to that later)... The menu has about a million options to choose from, so even if you're not a huge fan of seafood, there are other fish-less options. (However, you'd be missing out if you didn't just ~try~ something with fish from here.) I went with the fajitas de camarones - or shrimp fajitas. It was about 10 lb. of sizzling, spicy shrimp with peppers & onions. So good and definitely worth $18. Paired with an ice-cold Pacifico and a couple of scoops of ceviche, I was in ~~HEAVEN~~... Plus it was enough food to feed me the next day, too.

Now back to that experience I was talking about earlier: Despite my party of 10 arriving without any kind of reservation, we were seated immediately - I'm not even sure if they really even have a reservation process? They seem to know how to handle large parties on a whim - Anyway, that was impressive because it was a Friday night! The service was also quick and attentive. The food did take a bit to come out, but that's just fine. We had plenty of ceviche, cerveza, and live mariachi music to enjoy in the meantime!"}
{"text":"Been going here for. While food is always delicious!! Waitress was very busy so I understood why she was taking a little long on refills. We were also a party of 15 and they managed to take care of us well. although food did come out at different timing like a through a 10-15 min span for all of us to receive our food the rest was good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice while visiting Las Vegas. If you're looking for average Mexican food after a night of partying, this place isn't bad! They are always busy so arrive early. Be prepared to wait on the weekends. It's certainly nothing fancy but they do have a variety of beers and drinks and the menu is huge. There is a lot of seafood to choose from. On my first visit I got a shrimp burrito and it was pretty tasty but very spicy. The second time I ordered the seafood pasta. I was starving so I liked it but it was actually super heavy and nothing extraordinary. There's a lot of chicken in it and it comes with buttery bread which is great for dipping in that alfredo like pasta sauce. The order was humongous so you can easily share. Overall, it's a fun place with live music at times and decent service. I do think it's rather overpriced considering the quality of ingredients. It's on average $15-$20 a plate."}
{"text":"I guess its a hit or miss, depending on when you go during the week.  Our party of 5 went for a late lunch on a Friday.  The food was just okay.  Since their specialty is seafood, I would stick to ordering just seafood.  My daughter who does not like seafood ordered steak tacos and was disappointed at how dry and bland they were.  I ordered the carne molcajete, which came with shrimp, chicken, steak, chorizo and cheese.  It was good, not great, and all the meats were dry as well.  The other people in our party ordered seafood dishes and loved them.  

The atmosphere is unique.  They have a battle of the bands type of deal going on between a group with instruments and a mariachi, so be prepared for it to be loud in there.  Not only the music is loud, but the people are loud as well.

The service was not great at all.  Waited for our server for a while initially, had to wait for our drinks, then more of a wait for her to actually take our order.  Refills were a pain to get as well.  I would recommend going maybe on an off day during the week if you would like better service, but since I live out of town and heard good things, that's why I went ended up there on a Friday due to time constraints.  I know they have other locations, so they may be better than this particular one."}
{"text":"Ok this place is great, the micheladas really hit the spot after a massive hangover. It was 12 of us and surprisingly  we were seated immediately. I ordered an \"aguachile\" which is raw shrimp cooked in spicy lime juice garnished with sliced cucumbers and red onions, a dz oysters and a seafood stew. Ok ok I shared the oysters and aguachile with my brother in law.. The aguachile was really really good, the green chile is frkn amazing, the stew is definitely a hangover cure! this will be our new hangover cure spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Cultural lesson: a molcajete is a traditional Mexican mortar. As in a mortar and pestle. The molcajete dish usually involves a hot molcajete filled with various meats, Mexican cheese and veggies. And I was craving one!

Soon as we got there we were immediately greeted with the sounds of live Mexican Norte√±o music.

Now, you might think you've been to a traditional Mexican restaurant because you don't eat Taco Bell and maybe you've listened to other Yelpers suggestions but lemme tell ya it isn't a true Mexican restaurant unless you have folkloric art on the wall, some variant of the michelada, some one trying to  sell you jewelry, CD's or flowers while you eat, a live conjunto [Mexican Norte√±o group] and authentic Mexican dishes. This place had all of these things and more! So it is legit.

Again, if you're not ready for music so loud you can't hear the person next to you this is not the place for you. If you're not ready for salsa so hot it'll make you cry this is not the place for you. If you're not ready to dish out $20 for the conjunto to play your favorite song. This is not the place for you. 

But if you *are* ready for all of this then you're in for a treat.

My molcajete was delicious and my girlfriend's shrimp empanadas were the best I've ever had. My michelada [Mexican beer cocktail] was good and almost every one was very courteous and on point in their customer service. Which I appreciate more than the actual food.

The reason I can't give this place a perfect score? 

The waitress we got. Her name was Patty and she was very rude and dismissive. I think she eventually caught on that we were displeased, and that her tip would be in jeopardy, with her initial service so she tried to fix it but at that point we had had enough. We're not total dicks, so we still tipped her 10% but it could have been WAY more had we felt we weren't a burden to her.

Anyways, I'd go back. The food was good and except for 1 hiccup we enjoyed our night."}
{"text":"Must admit, the ceviche here the THE BEST EVERRR . came here for breakfast twice and was pleased both times. got pretty faded too, even tho they have pretty basic beer, corona, negra modelo, and dos x, $4.50 each. mariachi and ppl sellin flowers on sat morning, got pretty crowded and loud but was a pretty good spot to start off the day."}
{"text":"Food was a bit on the expensive side but totally worth the money. Portions are big and drinks were good too. They dont really have a bar, but they make basic drinks. Mariachi was playing and  small banda too"}
{"text":"You never know until you try. So we tried and now we know. This lonely star goes to the live entertainment. They were great. The only thing that didn't disappoint during our visit. It's a clean enough restaurant, but the service was slow and didn't explain menu items very clearly. 

I had a shrimp burrito. The portion was generous, but if it's not that good that's no consolation. The shrimp was overcooked- rubbery. The rice was a pale bland mess and the only thing I enjoyed was the beans. My husband had a plate of whole shrimp with a red sauce. It looked better than it tasted. 

Overall we paid $50 for 4 Cokes (no refills- it's bottles) and 2 entrees. We tried to give a card to the gent who brought our check and told to wait for our server - but I didn't catch why. We swapped that plan for cash after waiting- we just wanted to leave. The server saw us get up and ran over to ask if we were going to pay- maybe she thought we were making a break for it. We weren't- although the thought did cross my mind ;)"}
{"text":"Well i came here to eat a shrimp cocktail i kept getting shrimp peels on it wasnt seasoned good i had to season my own shrimp cocktail wtf its 18.95 u do it . The only good thing was the michelada and the salsa ans tostadas thats it"}
{"text":"best micheladas i've tried so far anywhere...lime juice shrimp soup and clamato in it..Delicious...good place to get the hangover out of you"}
{"text":"Expensive Mediocre Seafood.

I was expecting more from a marisco place not that great. We tried a little bit of everything here. I ordered shrimp imperiales, shrimp tacos governador, empanadas, Shrimp coptel, Ceviche botana, langostinas, micheladas. 

Nothing memorable, I judge a place right of the back off the salsa. Salsa no flavor stale chips. Next michelada for the hangover, this one was disgusting not refreshing at all. Their shrimp is not devined, disgusting eating shrimp dookie, ill. The shrimp is precooked for the ceviche does not come fresh. Our food smelled very fishy not fresh at all. The shrimp imperiales were ok the salsas they use are extremely bland no flavor at all I guess that's why they have several bottled salsas at every table. The tacos governadores were OK, they use tiny shrimp in these tacos with again a very bland sauce. My coptel de camaron very dissapointing no citrusy flavor at all, they serve it with all veggies on the side and lime. You have to fix it up yourself how unoriginal. The botana that we ordered again very bland very expensive 6 of us walked out of there with a $220 bill. 

Just to give you a little background, Im mexican grew up in LA, grew up on home cooking. This place will not give you that hangover cure and seafood craving you are looking for. Try small hole in the wall place I have on my other review in Vegas."}
{"text":"I think the only thing they did right was the micheladas. Service was terribly slow and they didn't even bring out all the food we ordered. The server was impossible to find. I ordered the shrimp cocktail and it had no flavor at all. I don't think I'll ever come back here."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Good music. 
I go whenever I am in Las Vegas.
Definitely try the shrimp tacos"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would. Should have read the reviews before going. Where to begin? Oh yes they have a sign that they want you to wait to be seated but then expect you to sit as no one welcomes you. The place was empty so you would think food would be served at a decent wait. Well first of all the waitress claims that our party of 10 was to big so she needed a minimum of 4 separate bills. We said ok then she took 20 minutes to bring our drinks. When the place was empty. I ordered a jarrito with tequila well it was a sunny d beverage no tequila there for $13 instead of the $10 on the menu with a quality of a dollar. Next our food after a long long wait was cold and tasteless. No lemons no salt on the table no refill of sodas no napkins but remember about the separate bills? Well each was charged a $10 tip on each one. So that's why the bills were separated. Mind you none of the totals were less than $90 when I orders fish tacos at $5 and shrimp cocktail plus my sunny d beverage and a michelada totaled to $85. My sister who ordered 3 items under $20 paid $70 . How is this place in business ???"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing one of best restaurants I've been to, I will definitely come here again when I come back to vegas. Great Food and service as well. If you like sea food this is the place to come."}
{"text":"They have live bands playing while you eat,and TVS to watch football games. Gets crowded but worth the wait. Micheladas are bomb and anything with shrimp in it is bomb...I definitely recommend the oyster's with ceviche on top! So yummy!!"}
{"text":"I will never ever come back to this place . One of the worst service ever.  I cant believe a busser was taking care of us instead of a waitress. This is my first and last night i come. Food was good but damn server suck. I think the manager should talk his employess if his gonna continue with running his business."}
{"text":"Food is delishes and great service, considering the fact that it's in Vegas sea food is bomb!"}
{"text":"I read a review somewhere that said this place had the best fish tacos in town...actually, all I knew was that I read a review giving the title of 'best fish tacos' to a place on Nellis Blvd with Mariscos in the name. I was working on this side of town for a couple months and drove past Mariscos Las Islitas daily. It's in a pretty random and trashy strip mall, but I finally decided to give it a try. I was on my lunch hour, so I didn't sample the famous micheladas or ceviche, but I did get the fish and shrimp tacos. They were excellent, maybe even the best in town. The shrimp and fish were both lightly fried in a delicious crispy batter, the chunks were meaty, and the tacos were accompanied by the usual cabbage 'slaw' mix and a little bit of sauce. Overall, the tacos were excellent, and I think average-priced, at ~$10 for 3.
It's not a takeout place, which probably explains all the seafood and the love for the micheladas, but I got mine to go, so I can't comment on the service.
Overall, the food was delicious, and I will be back when I have some adventurous souls in tow (just because it's a long drive) or when I'm working in the area again."}
{"text":"I would have gave this restaurant zero stars if i could. It is my second time here. The first time everything went awesome. It did take a long time for everything to come but we were in no rush.
BUT this time, we came in a party of 6. I ordered two tostadas of shrimp ceviche and a shrimp empanada and my niece ordered chicken strips and fries. Our order came within 5-10 minute intervals. I got my food first but I only got one tostada and one empanada. I was missing one extra tosata, then 10 mins later my brother, then 10 mins later his girlfriend, ect. My dad got his meal last like one hour or so later than I got my plate. RIDICULOUS. And we are about almost done and my niece STILL HAS NOT received her chicken tenders. And when we informed the manager he went to the cook, and she said that she send it, and he came back to check if we have the food hidden on or table. Seriously, who hides food?! Now that we're all done my niece isn't even a quarter done with her food. Ridiculous.
And we are done with our meal, my niece is taking her food on the go and I never received my second tostada. I won't be coming back here. Not even did they mess up once and took forever, they messed up twice with no apology."}
{"text":"This place is really good I'm from California and this is one of the best mariscos I have eaten and there cold michelada you should try the Coco loco it's fire"}
{"text":"The michelada is really what brought me here as I've been wanting to try it since I saw my friends postings. Beer of your choice mixed with clamato in a lime/salt/chili rimmed mug....so good!!!

Food is just okay, some were a hit (shrimp ceviche) some were not (fish ceviche). The raw oysters tasted fresh enough and the raw oysters topped with shrimp ceviche was delish.  The fish ceviche tasted \"off\", kinda mushy, really not to my liking at all.  I've had much better back home in SF...

The seven seas soup had fresh seafood but the broth was quite salty and lacked something...can't quite put my finger on it.. I've had better elsewhere.

My other half had carne sasada and enjoyed his dish, while another of my dining cohorts had the Alhambres- steak/chicken with veggies with cheese.  That was a bit salty also but their rice and beans were actually better than most places.  They served corn tortillas but were not homemade, same kind you buy at the grocery stores...too bad...

Overall- it was just okay, I would go back just for the cheladas and shrimp ceviche.  The prices are kinda steep, the bill came to $166 for the 5 of us, with only 3 people actually ordering entrees, the rest was the drinks and appetizers.."}
{"text":"The food was amzing.... I had the fish tacos and it was great... Had to ask for some extra stuff on the side like sour cream and cheese but they were good just the way they came... You can tell they use great quality ingredients... My husband had the Molcajete mixto which was also very good.... I had a little taste and the beans reminded me of my my moms..  I can not wait to go back.. 

Down side: service was a little slow for there to only be 5 tables and 4 servers... We went on a Monday afternoon so it wasn't busy... The girls were more into their conversation then the tables..."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give a better review. The food is great but the overlapping musical bands playing at full blast makes this place kind of annoying. The service is on point. The waitresses are always pretty fast and accurate. The molcajetes and shrimp cocktails are delicious and fresh. The only serious concern I have for this place is the restrooms!!! They are sooo gross and it feels like you're in a gas station restroom. No soap, and all the dispensers are tagged up. The image sucks!"}
{"text":"Delicious seafood restaurant, had a coco loco it was amazing. There's live Mexican mariachi. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Some reviews are not purely based on food, this is one of those places for me.  We were in the mood for Micheladas and have been looking for a place to find them GOOD ones not beer and tomato juice.  A Michelada is prepared with beer, lime, salt, and particular hot sauces or chile slices. There are several other optional ingredients.  And ohh soo good!  I have had them at the outdoor swap meet before but it is just to darn hot out right now to go out there and get them.  

So our quest begins... We search the web including Yelp and found this place.  The ambiance is awesome fun and makes you want to have some fun!  We walk in and they have dueling mariachi bands!  AWESOME!  LOL I had a blast drinking my micheladas and hanging with friends and having a snack.

This review is based solely on my experience and my drinks, I did not enjoy my food it was mediocre at best but I would go back for the drinks and the fun time I had."}
{"text":"I came here on my wedding for cinco de mayo the menu is very big and the food is so good!! Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I can't complain. Clean place with delicious food. Everything taste very fresh. The service could be a bit more consistent that's why I'm giving a 4 star instead of 5. Came in on a Wednesday and it took about 20 minutes to get our Bill. Other then that, I have nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Amazing!!!! Amazing food & michiladas. This is the Mexican restaurant to go to for authentic food and music. One plate can feed two people. Totally  recommend this place"}
{"text":"If you like hard core ethnic Mexican food, you'll love this place. We go every now and again and are always smiling when we leave. Most of the staff speak little or no English and we have to point to items pictured on the menu, but it's always tasty and they are very friendly. I have no idea of what I ordered, some kind of Asada, but was hella good. Worth the stop."}
{"text":"So after a long and crazy night on the strip. I woke up hungover. So naturally, my hangover cure is Mariscos. So I yelped a few places and Las Islitas was one of them. The mariscos here is fantastic. Very crowded but to me that's a good a thing. Didn't have to wait long at all considering we had a party of 8.  This place takes pride in there mariscos and its noticeable in there service and food. Everything was great here. With my budget hands I would have to say its kind of pricey but typical for outstanding mariscos. I'm not a local just visiting but I now know about this hidden gem. So next time I'm in Vegas I'll be paying this place a visit!"}
{"text":"The waitress was either high or asleep, brought our food but all wrong. Not attentive whats so ever, food was bland. I would not even waste my time coming here, they dont even acknowledge their customers. When we arrive we were standing around until we saw an actual employee to help us. This place needs some management , nothing special about this place. Why is this place still open?"}
{"text":"overpriced, ceviche was decent, guacamole was good- also had chicken quesadillas which literally tasted like they had chicken in them from McDonald's (so gross!!!!)"}
{"text":"Food is off the hook. The place is known for shrimp.  Big size plates big crowds. Even through they messed up my order we kept it and I got another plate."}
{"text":"This place has horrible service, food took for ever to be ready, after a long period of time waiting to receive the food I had to find out my food had a hair that's disgusting after notifying our server about the hair in my food he was saying the hair belonged to me, like really you don't argue with the guest, just resolve the problem! Never coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant four times before and each visit had been a great experience. That is until yesterday. 

First, as you wait for 45 minutes in the heat, they try and sell you pre-made micheladas. They come up to you with them on hand asking you if you want to buy them. At first we said yes, because we thought that the \"waiter,\" was taking the ones that he had with him to a different party. We quickly said no after he said, \"here you go, it's 18 dollars\". Who knows how long those micheladas had been sitting in a fridge? We were at a restaurant, not a charriada. We were expecting fresh ones, with our choice of beer. The ones that he tried to sell us came only in Modelo. I was really confused.

Then, when we were finally seated they ran out of chairs. They had to replace them with cheap party rental chairs. Nothing against party rental chairs, but they were too short! When I sat, I felt like a child sitting at the adult table. However, the staff worked with us, and were able to switch to an average height table. 

Our meal overall was mediocre. To start, styrofoam plates replaced the appetizer plates that they used to have. Also, long gone is they're fresh salsa. The stuff that they served us tasted like El Pato salsa. Oh, and the vegetables in our ceviche looked dull, which leads me to believe that just like they're micheladas, their ceviche had been hibernating in the fridge. Their guacamole was really, really good, but it wasn't brought to us until near the end of our meal. One last thing that I almost forgot, when we tried to order a margarita, we were told that they weren't serving any because they ran out of place to make them in. Again, that was really confusing. 

In the past, this was my go to spot for mariscos in Vegas. I don't think I'll go back again."}
{"text":"Islitas mariscos is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. This restaurant provides a lively atmosphere with the best seafood. It is LOUD so don't expect to easily converse at the table. My personal favorites are the shrimp empanadas. Ostiones preparados, and ceviche. Their menu has an impressive and large selection. I highly recommend trying islitas mariscos"}
{"text":"This place suck and are faults advertised the hours it say open till 9:00pm I showed up at 8:10 and they closed the door on me, after I had took an Uber and spent money to get there. So for those who like to rick getting a door slam and a sport not sorry this is a good place for them."}
{"text":"Yes it is the best sea food and all around mexican food in all of Las Vegas and they're molcajetes ate out of this world but don't take my word for it , So come on down ps.come early on Sunday you might have to wait ..
Oh yeah please say hi to Lupe the boss for me ... and Letty she's  the best 

Yup I'd say this place five yummies"}
{"text":"No se porque tanto alborot√≥ de este lugar. Es demasiada gente y una espera de horas. Cuando al fin vimos una mesa disponible AFUERA nos sentamos y ordenamos la comida. Hay m√∫sica adentro y afuera. Est√° muy caro y NO est√° buena la comida. El culichi town de California est√°  veces mejor! Las tostadas de camar√≥n est√° p√©simas. No tienen buen sabor.

Venden micheladas en la larga espera. 

Si pregunta cu√°nto le falta el se√±or dice lo mismo a todos que un momento m√°s. El c√≥ctel tienen una miseria de camarones. Prueben mejor la playa escondida est√° chico pero sabe mejor la comida all√≠. No pierdan su tiempo aqu√≠."}

{"text":"This place is horrible. The bf suggested this place. I was craving for a good shrimp cocktail. as soon as I walked in, i knew I made a bad decision. the shrimp cocktail was watered down. the shrimp looked disgusting. the worst part was that the shrimp cocktail was room temperature..are they trying to kill someone? it looked so disgusting I just didn't eat it. I tried a little bit of the watered down broth it came in, and it tasted like sea water!! worst shrimp cocktail ever!! my bf ordered an octopus cocktail. his was the same, watered down but he ate his since he was really hungry and we had already waited for a good minute to get out food. he said it was alright, but the next morning, he woke up with diarrhea and throwing up. food poisoning? most likely!!! good thing I did not eat that room temperature, watered down shrimp cocktail or else I probably would had have food poisoning as well. never coming back again!! btw kitchen look really dirty when I passed by it. and there's no heating lamps where the food sits ready to be expedited!! disgusting!"}
{"text":"I had my doubts because the Yelp rating is so low ! But I'm glad we tried this place regardless cos it was super yummy and fresh !

A friend of a friend that is local to the area comes here all the time!

We got different ceviches , shrimp tacos, and oysters and EVERYTHING was super delicious .. PORTIONS are HUGE also .

Next time I'm in Vegas I'm def stopping by !"}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant was the cold Modelo Especial. The ceviche was bland and the fish was not fresh. The fish tacos were super greasy as were the chips that accompanied the guacamole. This place is not authentic mariscos."}
{"text":"Only been on Sunday afternoons, always a small wait but it goes by fast. 

Micheladas are bomb and made in house with their own recipe.

Camarron de las huicha is a favorite, large and filling. Looks smaller then what's inside the goblet.

Mochajete is big with lots of protein and shrimp. Very filling and worth the cost.

Service is great and everyone is attentive.

To get seated fast, keep bugging the guy at the front that too your name and party amount, he seems to get you in faster since you are attentive to getting seated"}
{"text":"Tried it out last time we were in Vegas. A little pregame before getting ready to hit the strip. Love the food and place. Music is good! Aguachiles...mmm!"}
{"text":"Eater beware!! This place is a super rip off!!! Pulling up there was lots of parking for a Friday afternoon. We were seated with ease fortunately then we see the menu....$2.50 for a canned soda?!?! $2.50 for non refillable not even homemade horchata??  Ok my hubby's actual words were \"they're trying to rape us, huh?\" They brought out some tostadas, crackers, lime, and salsa. The salsa was pure onion with red food coloring. Worst salsa I've ever had!! Now what should have tipped us off to make us leave. We were enjoying our conversation then a guy selling CD's comes by our table....really? One, who listens to CDs still? Two, I didn't go to lunch intending on supporting your family I would like to be left alone. At this point I was just kinda like wtf? But what evs. 3 minutes later a guy comes around asking for money to sing a song....this is not super unusual in a Mexican restaurant but we were seated no where ear the band. Not 5 minutes after that a nother guy comes by selling flowers!! This guy wouldn't leave my table because my 3yo wanted flowers....well she tears apart flowers so um, no. So before we even got our food 3 people came by selling stuff. Oh and I forgot to mention as we were walking in this last had a bunch of swap meet crap for sale right outside the door. It's like these people pay rent to the restaurant to bother the guests!!! 

Ok so I ordered the carne asada plate since I don't care for shrimp or octopus. Hubby had coctel de Cameron y pulpo. 

The carne asada plate was $15.95 and had a small thin piece of meat, beans, pico de gallo, and avocado. Was it edible, yes. Was it worth $15.95? HELL NO! I can buy that type of beef for $3.99 a lb at Cardenas and hook it up. The fact that my food was just okay is a reason they aren't getting 0 stars(if it were possible)

Hubby's cocktail was unremarkable for the most part except they did give him fresh cut tomato, cucumber, and onion on the side. He orders cocktail wherever he can and I've never seen that! That's why I gave them 2 stars instead of one. 

If you are thinking about this place just skip it! My hubby said they used to be the big thing back in the day....clearly by selling crap table to table they need to make extra money!"}
{"text":"A large group of us came here during a weekday lunch for some quality bonding time. We had a group of about 14 and were easily able to get a table. The restaurant itself is super festive & colorful.

The prices are definitely a bit high, especially for the location, but the food quality makes it worth it. We started off the meal with some Micheladas, hands down the best I've ever had. I would come back here just for that. For a meal I shared the ceviche del mar with one other person. It was easily enough for 2-3 people. The seafood was very fresh & tasty, but I would have liked it to be a bit more spicy. Overall everything was very good though.

I'd recommend this place as a nice lunch spot or after work drink hang out. The shrimp cocktail is a must try for next time, it looked amazing."}
{"text":"My favorite are the aguachiles! They are really good. My husband and I go here every time we are in Vegas. It's away from the strip and we avoid all the crowds. Ceviche and empanadas also really good.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The shrimp empanadas are amazing! And the fish tacos are the best ones I've EVER had! It's a little pricey but worth it! Ask for the \"salsa veneno\" they only serve it if you ask for it."}
{"text":"I recommend  this place to everyone that's going to Vegas, after a long nigh out you need authentic Mexican seafood !! You will be born again.. TAXI is bit pricey about $30 from strip but its worth it! ask the front desk for a ride back to strip and one of there employee will take you back for small fee!! A MUST IN VEGAS!!"}
{"text":"This place is waaaaaaaaay overrated. Food is eh, service sucks and it's expensive for the quality. Waiters took forever to take out the drinks, food was brought out at different times. Some people were eating while the other side was starving, one side was finished while the other one barely got their food. Oh well. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"A must go to spot every time we come to Vegas.Camarones Imperiales are the bomb.empanadas are good the music is the best."}
{"text":"This place has great food and service!! I'm from Los Angeles and this is the spot where me and my family always go to when were in Las Vegas. They have the best Mexican seafood in town. The plates are delicious and well priced. The micheladas are the best that I've tried so far! So if you're in Las Vegas go to this restaurant you won't regret it."}
{"text":"First Time Here The Service was Amazing great food. Y los meseros est√°n bien Chulos !! Daniel was a amazing he really made us feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious!! Can't stress enough how tasty this place is! Tbh I'm not a big fan of sea food but oh boy the ceviche is AMAZING. I myself ordered camarones a la diabla and they were good but my friends shrimp ceviche was the best! Will be returning here soon!"}
{"text":"We ordered so much food but it was fun trying everything....a must try is the shrimp emanadas.."}
{"text":"First time at the Islitas restaurant. I've been meaning to try this place as I had heard mixed reactions to this place.

Well, all I have to say is that I wasn't disappointed. I really enjoy sea food and the taste of the items we ordered was delicious. 

I ordered a cocktail which was really big and it was packed with sea food. It was kind of pricey but you get your money's worth and good tasting food. 

There are also options for the kids just in case they don't like seafood. Chicken nuggets with crinkle cut fries are apparently popular, and not bad tasting either. 

Overall good food and a good experience. I will definitely be back for seconds!"}
{"text":"I had ceviche and shrimp tacos here and it was phenomenal. I love the culture and the live music! Our server Karla is so sweet and provided excellent service. My family and I love las Islitas!"}
{"text":"It's the last day to claim those Entertainment book coupons and after finding out Siena Bistro was closed for a private event, we headed to Las Islitas #3.  Their banner outside advertised lunch specials starting from $5.99, Monday through Friday.   

I had already called ahead and learned that their seafood dishes were not part of the coupon special.  After looking through their menu, it left us with very few choices.  (Their specialty is seafood, so the majority of the menu had some kind of seafood in it.)  On the back page of the menu were a few meat dishes so we stuck with that selection.

The waitress had already brought over tortilla chips, salsa, and fresh limes.  (The Big F really liked their tortilla chips and I found their salsa with just the right amount of heat.)  We were more than hungry by the time our food arrived.

The Big F ordered the Carne en su Jugo ($14.95) \"beef stew with bacon, onion and green sauce\" - The first thing I tried was their refried beans and was impressed.  Sure, they don't give much rice, and they really should give more beans because it's that good!  It's so creamy and unlike other refried beans I've had.  The Big F thought the beef stew was different, and liked it a lot.  His plate was licked clean.

I tried their Fajitas de Res ($14.95) \"beef fajitas\" - It came with either corn or flour tortillas, and I chose the flour kind.  Chunky pieces of beef with red and green bell peppers, onions, and some other red vegetable.  It was a pretty filling dish, and I had enough for leftovers.  The Big F found the beef to be a bit dry, but I loaded it with salsa and hot sauce, so I couldn't really tell.

We were definitely curious about their seafood dishes since we saw other diners enjoying themselves on generous dishes of ceviche.  

Overall, we were surprisingly pleased with our lunch.  We went in the afternoon, so it wasn't too busy.  We were probably more bugged with the 'no seafood' part, so we couldn't really enjoy what they offered if we wanted to take advantage of that coupon.  Oh well.  Next time!

American Express not accepted.

3.5 stars.

{"text":"This place is not the best. Food was poor and you will be greeted by every street vendor you can think off...The Caldo de Camaron was shrimp in water no vegetables , the carne asada plate meat was dry w/ no flavor, Shrimp cocktail tasted soapy no flavor... Plates are a $20 average.. entertainment was lively but I'm really disappointed. I will not come here again...nor would I recommend this place. Go to Mi lindo Michoacan on dessert"}
{"text":"This is our favorite mariscos spot when in Vegas been here several times and were never disappointed always enjoy and the service is #1 seriously it's a  must for us when we're in Vegas"}
{"text":"this place really rocks!...the food is delish...we dont mind the drive from the strip to come and enjoy some good food, drinks, and live musicos!!! the tacos al gobernador are yummy and the pulpitos are a must try! dont leave vegas without stopping by!"}
{"text":"Great food! Im from California but heard about this place so many times I thought i would give it a shot instead of going to the buffets and it was worth it! The shrimp was not over cooked like other places. The empanadas were by far the best i have ever had, I cant wait to go back to vegas and try another dish. Also they have love music playing, the vibe is great. I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Fantastic guacamole and ceviche. Unassuming location.  Pl turn down the loud tv station, tho..."}
{"text":"The food was amazing I'm from LA and I love seafood and it's good to know that if you go to Vegas and have a late night seafood craving this is the spot to go!! They close at 10pm . Good customer service all the way !! The staff checks on you to ask if everything's okay . I do recommend they give or offer a appetizer at the beginning when we sit down in the table . I tried the agua de coco and they give the coco in the side how you know is fresh cut . Michelada beer in the side so you see they don't cheat you and cocktail and shrimp tacos can't wait to try the other food"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service that place offers...The wait staff should get proper training in regards to customer service we had a guy approach the table and ask us for drinks. .then a min later another one. ..we told him that someone else had taken it...Once we got our drinks the server came and got our order. ..then a lady asked if we were ready. ..I was so confused didn't know who our server was...appetizer was brought out and then our entree but our appetizer was taken away :-(. .. we were not done. .I order a carne asada plate. ..but once I tasted it I realized it was not carne asada it was more like milanesa. .I told the waitress cause she said that now she was our waitress. .and she said I dunno. ..seemed so confused. ..I asked to speak to the Mgr....and 5 mins must of past and I asked her if she had told him and she said I don't think he will come. ..but 4 min later a server who was on the other side came and acted like the mgr. He was soo rude unprofessional and told me that it was good carne asada that he had sold over 50 plates that day and I was the only one that didn't like it. ..didn't help whatsoever. ..I didn't eat...left very upset and noone checked on us after wards. .I would of totally walked out. ..but I believe in karma. ..so i had to hunt down someone to pay. ..not going back"}
{"text":"Had a molcajete and 2 kids meals and our bill was $85?!?! Wouldnt if the food was amazing,  but not even close. Never again! Go to La Mojarra Loca people!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill..every other time we had came the food was awesome and the service was ok since they are busy they try here and there to see if everything is ok and if we needed anything but the last two times and today food was just bland, customer service sucked..took us more than hour just to get out of there to pay! And it was not busy at all today. Only once they came on their own to see if everything was ok...didn't freaking ask us if we wanted refills the many times they've passed by to take other people's orders...and to wait for the bill or boxes to take leftovers was just ridiculous...I think it's just better to come when they are super busy that's the only time u will get good service! Btw you would expect great customer service with everything being so overpriced so if you expect to get what you paid for then this place isn't it...."}
{"text":"After a long Vegas turn up, this place is perfect before that 4 hour drive home. Camarones A La Diabla is very good and spicy. Ceviche is awesome."}
{"text":"Best mariscos I've ever had !! live banda was awesome .. Wait time was not too long .. Customer service was also very great !! Would definitely recommend this place .. I will surely come back next time  I visit Vagas"}
{"text":"The food is OK is not bad but is not the best sea food neither the decoration as many mexicans restaurants is scandalous the biggest problem here is too loud there is a band playing live terrible music that I can't even talk to my wife or place my order to my waitress really...I'm Mexican so don't say I'm being racist  IT SAYS IT'S A RESTAURANT NOT A BAR OR A CLUB you came here to eat in peace not to dance for God's sake besides there is an army of people trying to sell you illegals copies of movies and all kind of things. ...I THINK IM GOING TO TRY TO SELL EARPLUGS HERE AND START MY OWN BUSINESS"}
{"text":"Great food! Horrible customer service. Our waitress was very nice but took forever to bring out our food. 
The woman at the counter who was charge us couldn't of been more unprofessional. She didn't know how to use h credit card machine, didn't know how to sum up the total with tip (even though I broke out the total for her) and she kept running my CREDIT card as a DEBIT!!! My card got decline because she kept running over and over as a debit. She put a hold on my card after trying over and over. Then she has the nerve to disrespect me by putting blame on us. I asked for another person to help... she put the card into the machine BACKWARDS! At the end I told them once again they didn't know how to use the credit card machine and I left no tip. But here is a tip: hire and train your staff for better quality service for your customers."}
{"text":"Once again this place does not disappoint us. The shrimp enpanadas, mango michilada, camarones a la diabla, and ostiones preparados were all on point!!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Went in with 45 ppl. Called 4 hrs earlier to reserve, the lady(server) said she would Oss on the message to the manager. I even gave her my number to call if there is any problema. We get there July 2nd Sunday and manager tells us there's no room and sit us outside in warm weather. I told him but I called a couple hrs before and I even left my number and he said he didn't received anything.  Well anyways we invest so much and had the mariachi and trio for hrs. We left the ppl inside without music. And we made the best out of it. Any how I'm going from now on to la Mojarra loca, way nicer, fun'er and service top of the line."}
{"text":"Went here because La lomita was closed, We had a big group party ordered different meals, hug disappointment. Ceviche look like cole saw, food didn't really have great taste and it's over priced."}
{"text":"The hubby and I usually get the same thing on the menu each time, it's our favorite! Ceviche Casero! So good, fresh, lime, with freshly made house tortilla chips- you won't go wrong with this. And it's enough for two. 

The location is north LV is much better, but when we can't make it out there we opt for this loc. Overall, seafood is pricey no matter what you get. I don't really enjoy their taco selection and burrito combos aren't that well."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is delicious. The ceviche is bomb, the empanadas are warm and delicious. The molcahete is so much food and so good too! Definitely one of our spots when we come visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I was in town and was excited about coming here. My sisters and I got tacos dorados, aguachiles, & Empanadas de camaron. Later that night we ended up in the toilet throwing up non stop. We got food poisoning!!!! We were throwing up the whole way back and I had to go to the ER. Do not eat here! It was the worse experience I've ever had. My stomach is barely recuperating from Saturday and Sunday. Just thinking about the food is making my stomach hurt. I will never come back!"}
{"text":"I will definitely be back whenever I'm in Vegas again. Found this place on yelp because I was craving a michelada to cure the alcohol withdrawal from punk rock bowling. 
My significant other and I shared oysters that were fresh, super clean and delicious. What I mean by clean is they did not taste like the ocean floor nor did they have any shell chips from being pried open. 
I had the shrimp cocktail which was ok-good but ok. My boyfriend had the camarones a la diabla which were perfect. Great flavor and not too spicy that he couldn't enjoy them. 
Micheladas were perfect! We also shared a shrimp empanada since the reviews on here all raved about them...they were not kidding. It was better than my cocktail. 

The restaurant was busy but service was good. They have a few televisions and even live music so it's also pretty loud; which if you're Hispanic you should be accustomed to that. LoL"}
{"text":"Pretty good, approve !!!! Welll worth the price! Very friendly staff, if your in town, you have to give it a try"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant hands down. It is loud and busy on the weekends but man the food is just amazing. Camarones empanizados are a must so are the aguachiles tropicales!! This is the place to go if you want real Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible the food had no flavor absolutely at all I will never return"}
{"text":"Was at Broad acres swap meet one Sunday with my wonderful girlfriend and wanted to try something new for lunch. Our eye was drawn across the street to an interesting sign and full parking lot so we decided to give Las Islitas a try. We were very pleased to see the full restaurant and friendly staff when we came in the door. We were seated quickly and placed an order. While waiting for our meal we enjoyed the mariachi band and took in the decor, very nice. Amanda's oysters came out quickly along with my shrimp Ceviche tostada, both were very good. We've enjoyed their shrimp tacos, burritos, and shrimp diablo. There are flat screens on usually set to football games or news, and the juke box can be a bit loud at times but all in all it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"OMG this place was so absolutely delicious! We came in on a Sunday and were greeted by amazing live music and a full house. We ordered the shrimp cocktail and the house special called mocajetes! Soooo much food ! Loved everything about this place . Definitely won't judge a hole in the wall again!"}
{"text":"This place is the best Mexican seafood I've had in the USA (I say this because nothing compares to fresh seafood in Mexico.

We ordered a botana, which had: aguachile, cooked shrimp, cooked octopus, shrimp ceviche, and fish ceviche. The portions were HUGE, eventhough we ordered a medium botana, my boyfriend and I were stuffed! The flavor of the ceviche was so good, the seafood tasted great, fresh, well marinated.

We also got shrimp empanadas, and they were so delicious, packed with well seasoned shrimp, and no fillers! They were cooked to perfection.

Their cerveza preparada is so yummy and refreshing, they put shrimp juice in it and I believe clamato, gives it a really good taste (lighter than a michelada).

The place is visited by  mostly Latino/Mexican families, and on the weekend, they have live Mexican music, that day they had taca tacas and mariachi. WARNING: It will be loud.

If I lived in Vegas, I would make sure to visit this place often. It's VERY good. Totally fell in love with it."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Anytime we come to Vegas this is definitely on our list. Although the last few times the service seems to be slow. The empanadas are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and the wife decided to give this place a try. We came in on a Thursday and the World Cup was going on,it was a bit loud but to be expected. I ordered the dozen oysters, seafood bowl, and chicken fajitas. We washed that down with hands down one of the best red beers I have ever had. 
Now onto the food. The waitress brought us out two waters which we didn't ask for and charged 1.50 a piece for them. The oysters were hands-down the worst oysters that I have ever tried in my entire life. They were not spoiled however they taste like River water smells and they were not cold even though they were served on a bed of ice. The seafood bowl was equally tasting like River water with a bit of saltiness however the broth was completely tasteless besides the hot sauce and salt and I put into it. The chicken fajitas were cooked well there was plenty of chicken fajita and also came with a side of rice and beans however the tortilla wraps or disgusting and fell apart in your mouth while you're eating. 
The prices are absolutely ridiculous the chicken fajitas were $16 my seafood bowl was 17 ,two beers were seven dollars apiece you could just go and get the same quality food for probably a third or a half of the cost.
The only redeeming factor of this place is the furniture inside does have a Mexican island feel and the Mariachi band was pretty cool but the food is utter trash and the level of attention that the workers placed on the customers was also poor.
I understand the World Cup was going on however these employees are being paid to serve customers but without the customers they would be out on the ass."}
{"text":"i came in early at 10am. it says it was open but waited about 15min and they opened. food was delicious, we had shrimp empanadas, tacos enchilados, and a michelada. everything was really good. its empty but theres nothing bad with that."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food around the strip, this is it. Seafood is fresh and delicious. Micheladas are delicious. Their service is always good. It's about ten minutes away from the strip, but worth the drive."}
{"text":"I do not know whether to leave a 2.5 or a 5...Lets start off by saying this place is super crowded. I guess that's a good sign right? They have live music (1 mariachi and 2 conjuntos) and it is extremely loud. Could not hold a conversation with anyone at our table. I went there with family and half were satisfied with their food and half weren't. I ordered the avocado ceviche, it was really tasty but it was room temperature which isn't to my liking, but over all it was a delicious item and really big too, I had to give half away. I also had some empanadas de camaron and they were soooooo yummy. One person from our party ordered a coctel de camaron and they brought her a caldo de camaron and the shrimp wasn't clean. She told our waiter and he said that they usually are clean but that this time they weren't (not such a good response, she wanted him to resolve the issue.) He didn't offer to take the plate back or have her get something else. Nice customer service. Another person ordered the 7 mares and came cold, they had to re-heat it. 3 people left their food and they did not even ask if everything was okay. I believe the owner was there and all he really cared about was the live music and the people next to our table dancing with the mariachis and having a good time. I left 2 stars because I liked my food, liked their portions but I really felt bad for the rest of my party who left unsatisfied and annoyed at their unsatisfactory customer service, food quality and pricing."}
{"text":"Best sea food for the price...drinks,and live music, love there fried ice cream ,they make the best fried fish...the pasta Brava omg! We also got the Oster there are so fresh like you just got them.out of the water, the atmosphere is very fun party like with the music playing right on your table it's so fun love it and we come her all the time..."}
{"text":"talk about great food and service!!! this place has got the best Mexican style sea food i've EVER had. The plates are authentic, delicious, and well priced. from the shrimp to the oysters, all dishes were super tasty plus the service was attentive and friendly. Consider leaving the strip if you are in the area and take the drive down to this spot. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Great spot to have good food and hear great Mexican music.

When one band stops the other continues.

You really don't have to pay for live music unless no one is asking to play a song.

Check this place out. You will have a great time."}
{"text":"Ambiente super perfecto!!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service and fab drinks. The only con is the prices... it was almost $80 just for me and my husband. Too expensive."}
{"text":"I had always driven by this place and would see how full the parking lot is so Friday Apr 7 my husband and I came for dinner. We arrived around 5:30 and were not greeted but seated promptly. There was a live band going on so it was loud. I got hit on by an older man with drumsticks in his hands only after having sat for two minutes. The items on the menu are pretty pricey. I just got myself fish tacos (three of them for $12) and my husband tried the shrimp enchiladas (with rice and beans $17). The tacos were pretty basic but the enchiladas were a one star. This place is usually pretty busy so I don't think we'll need to come back."}
{"text":"Very overated marisco spot. Way too high on prices for the taste . Mariscos el puerto way better and cheaper. Mariscos el pariente was also better than this spot."}
{"text":"Last time my boyfriend and I came to Vegas we came here with some friends and I don't remember what I got exactly but it was some shrimp dish with rice and beans. The shrimp was ok, and when I picked up some beans put them in my mouth I felt something hard. It was a piece of one of those stainless steel scrubs for the dishes. The waitress was very apologetic and offered to bring me another plate or something different on the menu. I did not make a big deal, I told her it was okay and just started picking at my boyfriends plate. He had the pasta brava and it made me regret not ordering another plate when she offered, but the portion was pretty big so it was ok. This past weekend we were back in Vegas and we made sure to come back here for the Pasta Brava it is so GOOD! It tastes like Alfredo sauce but with a bit is spiciness. I cannot describe it but it is a must try!"}
{"text":"I went to this incredible mexican restaurant w/ my dad's niece and her family just tonight. When i took the first bite. the reaction was 'holy cow, i have never tasted such incredibility in my whole life!'
What my party ordered was the fish platter that serves six, carne asada because my sister abhors seafood for unknown reasons, and the cuccaracha shrimp. I thought i would not like it, but i was wrong. and the best thing was there was a mariachi band that played continuous music.
for reasons i cannot fathom. The green habanero sauce got me crazy with tastebud scorching. The sauce was so spicy, my nose started bleeding, it was that spicy. The bill was kind of pricey, but after the service, quality, and satisfaction form the meal; i felt that the experience was worth every last cent. Plus, their tortilla chips were not like i would normally see, instead it was like a tostada disc. they were pretty good as well.
As a matter of fact, everything; down to the last piece of shrimp was worth the drive and the expense my party incurred. 

In conclusion, if you are in the mood, for certified pure mexican seafood, big portions, and consistently friendly service...
You have come to the correct place."}
{"text":"Shrimp sushi not good. The fried rice has a wierd taste and color. Paid with debit card and was ID. Also, they took my license number down for who knows what reason. I called on the phone before coming and they said they had live music (norte√±o) which was not true. They had a guy and a girl singing like karayoke night. Never coming to this place again. Couldn't give it less than one star, so that's why I'm rating a one star."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 times. It's a must visit every time I'm in Vegas. They have improved the patio area to include trees that provide a nice shade for visitors. The service was great and the food even better. The coco loco is my ultimate favorite and this is the only place that I know that sales it. The coco loco deal includes the coconut water, the coco skin, and a shrimp cocktail.  We were in a hurry, yesterday, Labor Day holiday because we had to drop someone off at the airport. The waitress made our orders come out fast and she was so nice about it. Another gentlemen packed our left overs in ice to keep it cool."}
{"text":"Quick review:

Came here after a wedding for dinner and to mingle with friends and was quite surprised with the food and beverages here. Everything was delicious. Had the garlic prawns and the combination plate. Great food; place was packed and there are like 4 separate bands all vying for your attention. It felt like you were listening to mariachis the \"P Diddy\" remix version. You mix in some dudes trying to sell you roses and it's like your standing in the middle of Tokyo and everything is spinning around you...whirlwind place but great food. Hats off to the chefs in the back!!

BTW. How come when you turn down the rose guy's offer he looks at you like you're a loser? I'm like, I don't want a rose and his facial expression was: \"you're a sad excuse for a human being...\" 

Just wondering...

You must try this place. It will surprise you. Kinda pricey though...but you're in Vegas..."}
{"text":"My family and I were here just visiting & came here to Celebrate Fathers Day. Wait was long but its understandable because of the special day. Our waitress was really annoyed by the bad day she was having at work being that the restaurant was too busy. She gave us bad service. They didnt have all items in the Menu. She made us feel really uncomfortable we only stayed because our kids were really hungry.I'm just looking at my bill and come to see my bill included her tip ?? honestly I didn't think our bad server deserved a $36.32 tip. I would not have given this girl named Bere any tip for her bad service. I mean where I come from we decide the amount of tip we should give our waitress and is not automatically charged in the bill.First of all if I were the owner of this place I would first be embarrassed about this and second I would train my people to give good customer service. Plates are pretty pricy and the least we deserve is good customer service. I would never come back to eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. No lunch specials just an overly priced menu. $8.00 for a cheese quesadilla! Portions are small. My chips were old and stale. My chicken was dry, just hope don't get food poisoning. The service was not good. I felt ignored. I was not offered a salsa or water refill. At checkout, the waitress just dumped the bill and left. I had to get up to pay at the cash register. Very cold and rude service. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and quick service. Place gets packed on Sundays. Ordered the molcajete super hot and fresh. Order of shrimp ceviche makes about 10 tostadas."}
{"text":"The worst service ever the manager Is the worst example of what good service should be. Expensive load waitress forgot to put the order in waited one hour for the food never again. The host was acting like he was herding cows"}
{"text":"I'm so sad to see the stars this place has.... It was my first time here the food was DELICIOUS!!!!! we went around 10am so it was pretty lonely and quiet... No music or anything kind of weird, too early maybe, haha like 30 minutes later they began playing music and made things less awkward. The food did take a little while to get to the table but once it  arrived it made up for anything else that could have gone wrong.....we were a party of 7 and we each got different plates and picked at each others food everything was too Good! The agua de horchata was on POINT! THIS WILL DEFINITELY BECOME MY FIRST STOP next time"}
{"text":"Food is OK, some items pretty yummy...SOME, service sucks! These bitches act like they have a stick stuck up their ass! My Shrimp and fish soup was missing the veggies and when I told the waitress she said they were frozen and if I wanted to wait a lil longer. Bitch Whattt????? Never again coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food, service,  and environment!!! Their Micheladas are the best. Their food is very good and authentic. We ordered the ostiones preparados, ceviche, and a vuelve a la vida. Everything was delicious and our server was very attentive. If you're okay with a mariachi playing while you eat,this is the place to enjoy great food and music in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday, ordered 3 different seafood plates. From oysters, shrimp cocktail to ceviche. Besides the Oysters, In the back of my head I knew the Seafood texture was off but ignored it. Thought probably I was just being picky ---- flash-forward  to today - I am very bloated and have the biggest Stomach pain ever. I know its from eating here. 
Tip: Don't eat here. 
Moral: Listen to your intuition. 

Hope it helps. You're welcome."}
{"text":"How could I have overlooked this Jewel on the  northeast side of town? Not only was the food very good the waitress there was so nice and pleasant. I found her to be very attentive and even while I was waiting for a to-go order offered me water! This place serves mostly Seafood and I'm excited about trying some of the other dishes that they have. The Establishment is clean quaint and has some very interesting artwork to look at. Lots of different hot sauces to choose from that are placed right on the table. Definitely a place to try for people who like exploring hole in the wall restaurants! You might be surprised what you will encounter that would make you want to come back."}
{"text":"On our search for the best authentic Mexican restaurant, we tried Las Islitas.  It was very noisy inside, I could not hear my dinner partner across the table.  Mexican music played loudly over the speaker, and a juke box played in the back.
Chips were okay, the salsa was good.  We ordered the shrimp tacos and chili relleno.  The tacos were deep fried (not stated on the menu), and greasy.  They were more like an empanada.  They were plain and bland.  The relleno was greasy as well and soggy.  It also had very little flavor.  It was also somewhat pricey for a strip shopping center, \"dive\".  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, so that is why I would give it these stars but the service is trash. I came here on a Monday night with my boyfriend, and as we walked in we were just stared at by the waitresses but no one helped us. An older man then came to seat us and get our drinks. It took the waitress quite some time to come to our table to get our orders. The vibe was just off with this waitress, I don't know if we just caught her on a bad night or what but she was not friendly at all. It was not a busy night, so I did not understand why we didn't get much attention. As I said before, the food was amazing. I ordered the camarones al mojo de ajo and some empanadas de camar√≥n (garlic shrimp and shrimp empanadas). As we were done eating, the waitress took a good 15 minutes before she came to offer us to go boxes and the check. I would only return for the food but the service is terrible. Couldn't imagine what it's like here when it's busy!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! Had the molcajete, amazing! The chorizo was so delicious! Our waitress was very helpful and attending. Would stop by and check up on us. The micheladas are bomb too, so if your craving one this is the place to try. Was a bit iffy about trying it for the 2.5 stars it had but I convinced my brother to try it out."}

{"text":"So I called early in the morning at 8 AM. It's Father's Day and my dad wants have breakfast and see the soccer game. Some guy answered me with attitude, all I asked is are you guys open and are you guys playing the soccer game? And he said yeah of course we have breakfast, then hung up on me."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Not by choice... just tagging along with people who swear it's a magical seafood palace where Poseidon himself selects his little sea creatures for sacrifice and consumption by \"lucky\" humans. Well, my thought is; if you're the type of person that enjoys mediocre seafood, while listening to loud music, performed by amateur bands, in a confined space, this place is an absolute must... if not, you'll find much better tasting food and entertainment elsewhere.

The food is nothing to rave about, it's simple and uninspired.  Most dishes are the same ingredients cooked in varied ways.  For example, they offer three types of shrimp tacos; pan seared, deep-fried corn tortilla, and a baked empanada (it might be fried too). All three are served with the same toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream), the only difference is the taste that the different cooking method brings. i.e. a hint of cooking oil, or dripping in cooking oil. 

On weekends, they have up to three musician groups roaming the dining area asking customers if they would like to hear a song... sounds intriguing, right? Well, please remember that ideas on paper always sound much better than the actual execution. There is an insane amount of tables and chairs inside this place.  So much so that it's hard to walk around without bumping into someone's backside as you make your way to the restroom or anywhere else for that matter. I'm pretty sure the place violates building fire codes when it's full of customers. When the musicians play, it is incredibly loud.  So much so that I have to scream in a person's ear to have a conversation, even if they are sitting right next to me.  My ears were ringing for days after having lunch in this establishment... I was there for about 45 minutes.  Look, I get it, some people enjoy the loud, trumpet-drum-accordion-cymbal combo.  Not me though. 

Servers are very busy on weekends.  Do expect to not see your server for a significant amount of time - this translates into poor service.  The last time I was at this place, our server dropped off our food and we never saw him again.  I had to chase down a different server to ask for the check - and this was after nearly an hour of trying to get the attention of any of them.  It's ridiculous.  I did notice that the majority of them focus on customers who order alcoholic beverages... I guess it makes sense: keep the drunks happy and they'll keep spending money.

Venture and dine at your own risk. Experiences will vary."}
{"text":"Comida Deliciosa!! anbiente esta muy bien la espera es un poco larga pero vale la pena ir a probar este lugar.. servicio muy Bueno y la limpiesa ni se diga."}
{"text":"Awesome place para la cruda...... Good Mariscos and if you head over during the weekend Mariachi and Trio playing... You have to try the Michilada and the mojara.... all in all fast service/nice atmosphere/good food....."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5stars because I had a great time. I went to Vegas this past weekend for the canelo fight so it was very packed. I'm talking about an hour to two hour wait. I have never had so much fun waiting to be seated. Everyone outside was drinking and some were dancing to the musicos. While waiting i had a michelada which is not my drink of choice but i was treated so i complied. When we were finally seated I ordered the mojarra frita which was sooo good and buttery. Then my cuzns and I were bought 2 buckets of beer and a bucket of flowers which was very sweet. 
We came back the next day because of how much we liked it. It's a must now every time we come to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"The most amazing micheladas and horchatas in life are born here...not te mention all the food here is absolutely amazing especially good for hangovers...great service, good music an all around terrific restaurant!"}
{"text":"My first impression was that this quaint restaurant is certainly not a chain.  My last impression was how do I get out of here never to return!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant I have been too. The atmosphere of this place is very family like and loud (if you don't like loud places) with live music. We start off with the oysters. So fresh and amazing! All their food is fresh. I had the fried fish, I enjoyed that, but I love getting the pasta brava, it's a seafood soup, comes really big, has pasta, fish, shrimp, clams, and more, I highly recommend that. Also try the fried ice cream, the best."}
{"text":"I'm from California this is my first time coming here to this restaurant and damn the food was amazing I'm coming back for sure"}
{"text":"ordered some shrimp tacos.. super yummy...        jaiva tostada... not so much... Micheladas! amazing.....        Enjoyed Nice Banda....for hours.... and good atmosphere!!! definitely will come again... Service on Point...very courteous! with a large group of people"}
{"text":"This place is very good, everything I've had has been pretty good & service is good, it's always full of people & they always have mariachi or banda which I think is great. The salsa is not good at all, at least for my taste, that would probably be only thing I have to complain about."}
{"text":"The ceviche is life! $35 for a jumbo size! Definitely should've shared it! But the restaurant is amazing! The food is authentic! A little pricey but worth every penny! Highly recommend if you like mariscos and live banda! Just expect to spend about $100ish for two... but the portions are huge!"}
