{"text":"Get the BAKED (not fried, as it says in the menu) calzone!  Chef Chris, with the goatee, is a frigging magician.  He makes the the best I've ever had. It's that ooey-gooey -so cheesy-smooth ricotta-delicate golden crust, that isn't soggy, kind of experience. Jason, the bartender will turn your night into an experience you won't remember the next morning, if you get my drift. The owner, Spencer, is the guy that will make things right if it isn't already. Prices are super reasonable. They have karaoke every night if that's your thing. I come here right before I see a movie at the remodeled AMC, which is an awesome combo!"}
{"text":"Thank you Spencer for making my bff Alex's birthday one to remember! The food and drinks were awesome and everybody there was so nice! We had the two pounds of wings which were nice and crispy and a pepperoni pizza. Everything was well cooked and delicious! I'm usually weary of thin crust pizza because a lot of places that have them are really soggy but this pizza was really good! The server was really busy because it was a Saturday night but she made sure to keep checking up on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Singing karaoke here was so fun! I loved the whole vibe of this place! I told Spencer (the manager/ karaoke dj) it was my friends 21st birthday and he made sure to embarrass her with a birthday song and a giant dick made out of cheesy bread lol. They gave her a birthday shot too!!!! This was one of the best nights ever thanks to him and the staff they were all so very nice. We will definitely be coming here regularly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and I keep coming back.

Good pizza by-the-slice. Best of all they use the top-quality cheese. 

New management since about a month ago and they are definitely on the right track."}
{"text":"Unexpected atmosphere and great late night food, I was totally caught off guard to how awesome the food was especially since I ordered online at 3:23 am Friday morning.  My food was hot and delicious I ordered the lemon pepper wings and the pick three - cheese sticks, poppers, and chicken fingers.  The poppers were awesome and so hot mmm mmm mmm.   I walked in at about 10 minutes to 4 am (closing time for these guys) I was greeted by the bartender cute petite and had a great smile I was pleasantly surprised by the eclectic décor and lyrics on the wall I love karaoke so I could imagine people enjoying themselves here in this space that's seems to be a very progressive establishment! The food was great but the atmosphere of great customer service between the bartender, the manager, and the cook (yes the cook this dude came out of the kitchen to let me know it would be a few extra minutes while my very late online order would be finished- thanks for that dude). I left wanting to come back! Go here order the poppers the cheese they use is creamy and is unlike any other I've tasted. It will melt in your mouth and will quickly become your favorite too along with this place."}
{"text":"Usually try new places when I see a flyer on my door and this one looked pretty good. Decent prices and good deals.

I live a few blocks over from the place so I figured it would be quick so my girlfriend and I placed a delivery order. I should have taken the girl who was taking the order as a red flag. She did not know what one of items on the menu contained. \"I dont know...\" (Gold Spice wings to be exact)

After finalizing the order, the order was read back and all was good. Problem #2: The girl put me on hold and I heard her ask another employee if she should write down an address....Ok!? Im ordering delivery here.

So an hour goes by, no food. Called back and asked the status of the order. Apparently she wrote down the wrong address and the pizza will be here in 10 minutes. 25 minutes pass by so another call was made. The driver left 5 minutes ago is what we were told. Never made it. This was the very first time EVER that I have canceled an order. I did not want cold pizza almost 2 hours later!

Called a pizza place 10 minutes away and got a hot pie within a half hour!

Read the other reviews! Pretty much the same experience!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE & BAD FOOD!
Walked in for beer and pizza with my little sister and fiancé. I said hi and The waiter stared at us and didn't say anything, I then broke the ice with 'we'll just sit over here.'
We then sat for 10min while the waiter chatted up a girl at the bar before asking what we'd like to drink. I asked for a pabst and the waiter wasn't familiar with that brand or the menu so I ordered a miller lite.
 We then waited 20min for my beer and our waters. 
Then he placed our orders for our appetizers and entrees. 45min later we hadn't even gotten our appetizers, I went outside for a smoke, upon my return the waiter asked me 
'what the hell?! Did you pound a couple beers next door?' 
I politely responded with
'I went out for a smoke' 
He then picked up my half empty miller lite in attempt to call me out and then returned to talking with the girl at the bar. 
By this time he brought out our entrees first, 5min later brought out half our appetizers, 15min later brought my sisters salad and acted like this was normal protocol.
Aside from the piss poor service the pizza doe was raw, the calzone was burnt, and the salad was drowned in dressing. 
We took a few bites, asked for the bill, and left no tip."}
{"text":"This place is one of the most chilled out, relax place on mill. Staff is pretty cool and food is great. Lots of regulars come here and for good reason. Worth a visit or 2! I wish they had a dance night or music themed nights(Friday 80s night..or 90s night etc). It would make this place perfect."}
{"text":"Sooooo I was looking for the best slice of pie on mill and I have to say that I didnt get one here --- reason is as I was waiting for my pie the very nice kid was twirling the tongues and they fell on the floor twice....take this as you would like - only reason for the two stars is the nice counter kid (slightly tooooooo stoned but who would want to work in a bar without being stoned ;-)"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place through GrubHub... I'd never heard of it before.  

The food I got was terrible... the mozzarella sticks I ordered were severely overcooked, they tasted burnt and most of the cheese had vacated the batter into a hard rubber like lump that I couldn't even bite into.  Seriously... I've never had such bad cheese sticks and they are a bit of a staple in my diet.

I also got a calzone...  it was flat as a pancake, I'm used to them being more of a stromboli shape with more filling than dough.  This one was mostly dough & sauce, with barely any cheese.  If they put the ricotta in, there wasn't enough for me to be able to see or taste it, and it has a really distinctive taste.  And, the part that really annoyed me, it wasn't fully cooked.  For as flat as it was, I'm amazed that the cheese inside hadn't melted and the inside parts of the dough were still raw.   (as an aside, I wish their menu on GH stated there was sauce inside, as I'd have ordered it without the sauce, I'm used to east coast calzones where the sauce is always on the side)

All in all... I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Amazing place great drink specials and great food they deliver and have karaoke 7 Nights a week this is my favorite spot ro be!!!!"}
{"text":"First time having food here. We order some wings, a calzone, and garlic knots for delivery! Everything was excellent, we did receive bone in wings when we ordered bone out, not a big deal. I called and they sent me bone out wings no problem! Great food, and customer service! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING!, RAW PIZZA!, NO HEALTH FOOD STANDARDS!, ABSOLUTELY FILTHY!

     I live near Mill Ave and this place is the only place open after 2am.  Every time I've been there the food and service has gotten worse and worse. I thought the first time maybe they just didn't cook the pizza long enough but it's been soggy and so floppy every time I've tried it that you couldn't even pick up a slice without all the toppings falling off! The pizza dough was RAW! The meat they used tasted like it had been left out overnight and over cooked in a microwave. Last time i went in late at night and got FOOD POISONING from some mediocre chicken wings. The same night i noticed all the pizza they leave sitting out, under NO protection and NO heat lamps is the same gross pizza they use to REHEAT for customers. I went by for drinks one Friday night and saw them reheat the same pizza for customers that had already been sitting out for 4 WHOLE HOURS!!!

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND NEVER GO INSIDE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!!"}
{"text":"We waited for an hour with no food or service. While people who came after us got their food first. Very poor service."}
{"text":"Karaoke is always a lot of fun, BUT, the pizza truly does SUCK!!!  And I am from BROOKLYN NY, and pizza is my favorite type of food, so please DO NOT tell me I do not know what I am talking about."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night, met some new friends crazy good drink prices, had a blast and once the karoke got going it was was a whole different atmosphere even with just like 6 people in there (pretty sure it grew to more but left early in the night around 930ish). Would definetly recommend not only for the above mentioned but also, Pizza bowls!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered through grubhub @ midnight on a Sunday thinking it would be pretty quick.  Delivery took a little more than an hour and a half.  I had called first to make sure they weren't closing soon... And the guy i talked to sounded like a rude, lazy slob(I pictured Arty from the Howard Stern show)  his parents probably own the place


Even though it was 35 minutes late my sandwich was still kinda warm... And my meatball pasta was okay - except they forgot the meatballs!!!!

DO NOT order from this place.  There are plenty of late night spots in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Wowzers I will knowingly never eat food from here again.

I placed an order via Grubhub and awaited for the food to arrive.  We were beyond starved and the moment it arrived  it was time to dig in.  

I started with the salad, which was presented well and crisp.  After removing a layer we ate and continued our studies.  Time for more salad anyone???

It certainly was...until I looked down and noticed a dead FLY in the mix.  Ewww, how disgusting!!!

I don't remember ordering extra insects in my salad.  It certainly had me wondering that if their quality control for food preparation was this horrid, which other insects could we have consumed in our bug salad.

We were rather grossed out by the ordeal we did not eat the pasta we ordered from them.

I called the restaurant the next day, and they mentioned a manager would call me in a few minutes, after confirming my address and phone number.  No call or acknowledgement of the problem from management.  No thanks, I am unable to respect a business who operates without responsibility for their mistake and or \"mixup\"....

If you order food from them, be careful.  You might receive extra bits you did not ask for.

I hope this is helpful for someone, I wouldn't want you to have the same experience."}
{"text":"The bartender was the most arrogant and incompetent person at the bar, which sucks when you go to a bar to drink with friends. He did not know how to make a drink we requested and went on to argue with us about what the 'actual' name of it was, in an attempt to save face with his drunken cohorts. He is an imbecile and works Saturday nights. Do NOT go to this place unless you want terrible drinks and an argument with this idiot."}
{"text":"My pizza was delivered ice cold... not worth the money or wait. This is my first ever review thats how disapointed I am"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza anywhere. The wings are amazing, and the drinks really get you there, if you know what I mean. The staff has attention and pizzaz down pat. The nightly karaoke is my main attraction."}
{"text":"Awful service, awful food, and really expensive, ... All together it's just a waste of time to even step foot in this place. If I could give them a zero I would."}
{"text":"Fabulous little place for pizza.  We come here before Sun devil games - always very friendly and great service.  Really good pizza!   Tonight we were pleasantly surprised with the live music.  Thursday nights 6:30-830p - they have Mark Shirtz #dirtyshirtz playing!  Great voice, guitar and selection of music - definitely something for everyone.  He plays covers as well as his own songs he has written.  Mark puts a nice spin on all your favorites! We enjoyed listening and singing along! 
If you are looking for good food, music and fun - check out 414 Pizza in Mill ave in Tempe.  We will definitely return on Thursday's! There was also Karaoke as we were finishing up! Such a fun time!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood spot tucked in at the north end of Mill Ave. If you want to hang out with your friends and have a great time this is the place. Karaoke every night starting at 9PM, delicious pizza by the slice, and the friendliest staff you'll find in Tempe.
This place is under new management and they're doing an amazing job, I've only had good experiences at 414."}
{"text":"Went to the 414 because of Groupon. The place is decent sized with music and plenty of tvs. I ordered a 12\" cheese pizza and onion rings and my husband ordered a salad with chicken. Onion rings and salad came out first. The onion rings had decently thick onion inside. The salad was amazing looking. It's a better salad than what you would get at a fancy restaurant. The pizza was pretty decent. The crust wasn't super oily and the dough was light and fluffy. The star was friendly and checked on us frequently but not overwhelmingly so."}
{"text":"This review is 5 stars solely for the pizza. It's really good, one of the better pizzas you can get. Delivery until 4am is very nice too.

The crust is the right kind of thickness. Not thick but not a super thin crust either. They give plenty of sauce, and it's a solid sauce. The pepperoni slices are thicker than most and makes for a great pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"We walked into the restaurant and although only about 6 customers were there, we were not even approached by anyone for at least 5 minutes after seating ourselves. Despite the fact that at least 3 employees could see us I had to get up and request a server, which then took another few minutes to greet us.  I ordered a draft beer, which took about 8 minutes to get and was not full.  My companion and I ordered fried mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, and a large pizza.  About 20 minutes later, our pizza arrived and we had not yet been served our appetizer.  After eating the first piece of pizza, we received our cheese sticks, which were very good.  The pizza was not.  It was so greasy that my companion and I both turned to each other with an \"eeew\" face, and I began sopping up the puddles of grease with several napkins, literal puddles in every pepperoni and all over the pizza.  I picked up a piece and it was too soggy to stay horizontal, even when folded in half lengthwise.  Service was very inattentive and the pizza was brought out before the appetizer.  Beer was not full.  Pizza was limp, soggy and suuuuper greasy.  Thank god I had a Groupon and didn't pay full price for this disaster of a meal.  I will not go back.  I would recommend an ice water from this place.
Unnecessarily LOUD karaoke began just as were were finishing our crappy meal, so we beat a hasty retreat for the door.  Thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Great music, great beer, great music. I would totally recommend if you are in downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"The pizza was good for late night delivery. Fries and wings were meh. 5 small wings cost 7.25...horrible deal. Would order the pizza again but not the sides."}
{"text":"Karaoke  5 nights a week! ! Pizza, beer, yes... it is fun!! I had Kiltlifter, Garlic knots, deep fried zucchini,  all good. The pizza looks great!!! Spencer is cool!!! A lot of great singers!!"}
{"text":"I am a singer songwriter who just loves going to small karaoke bars. These guys were really personable, gracious hosts to all the customers. The fact that anyone can get up and sing and not feel uncomfortable is always a welcome vibe. No ego here. Just a bunch of people looking to cut back on stress, and bond. Maybe even make a new friend. I know I for one will be coming back to this place next time I'm in the Arizona area. All the workers are really chill. Special shout out to Alyssa the server, Marie the PIZZA driver (mobile pizza-smith), Spencer is a really modest guy who is not afraid to get down on a track with you. Come here for a good time. Great for groups."}
{"text":"This place was terrible! My pizza was cold, the tea was rancid, and the waitress told my husband she had brought him lemonade, when it was clearly water! We only stayed because I had purchased the Groupon already. We will never go back!"}
{"text":"Aaron best bartender in Tempe and cute! He  recommended a drink that was made perfect!! Reasonable prices and great service! Pizza was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great bartenders, great food!!!! Amy and Anthony are the best ever! I would totally recommend coming to see them and enjoying there awesome customer service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 12 inch pepperoni and wings. Had it delivered. The delivery person didn't include the sides of ranch that I paid extra for also the pizza left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Great service and a tasty menu. Sampled the white pie, margherita and meatballs. The table chose white pie over margherita. The meatballs were very moist and the sauce had a kick on the back side. If you aren't looking to try a few things I would recommend the calzones. Not too filling and made just the way you like with your choice of ingredients."}
{"text":"Come here when I travel to Tempe.  Fun crowd, fab.com karaoke book and the bartender (Kory) tonight was very sweet to an old lady like me.  Stop by for a good time!"}
{"text":"Wrong order delivered. Employee at the restaurant was incredibly rude about it. Can't say anything about their food as I was not able to eat it...but this customer service experience was lacking to say the least."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time a couple weeks ago and I honestly couldn't think of calzone that tasted better I was blown away that it was so delicious so today I was hoping for that same results and it didn't even come close to the mark it was as if I went to the wrong restaurant because it was not even a shadow of the one that I had last time so I guess it all depends on who is making it seemed as if somebody took some pizza dough cooked it then put the toppings on it and just folded it in half it wasn't cooked together it was absolutely horrible the there was no taste i've never in my life had to put salt-and-pepper on a pizza just to give it some substance I don't know but you guys completely missed the mark tonight and was disappointed to the point of I was kind of pissed about it just very little effort went into making it I literally think that you guys cook the dough first then put some pizza toppings on it and just folded it in half and gave it to me it was cold and everything but the first time I ate a calzone there I fell  absolutely in love with that calzone so really big letdown to end up with what I did tonight sorry had so much to say but pretty bummed I paid that much for the by far worst calzone I ever had in my life"}
{"text":"Why settle for drab pizza with boring ingredients when you can have awesome? I love the food, but I'm addicted to the nightly karaoke. And the song selection!
There are wonderful people and staff. Even though it's off Mill Ave the regulars and pizza lovers alike are fantastic people. The atmosphere has bettered recently with the changes in furnishings and decor. The art on the walls really make for a musical experience. I believe I've found my cheers and my second home."}
{"text":"We went for the karaoke and despite a hiccup with a few people, I had a great time. The crowd is diverse in age, and so many people were really talented singers. I was content just watching. 

I didn't want to sing, but my daughter, V and N put the pressure on me and I finally gave in. I now realize I am tone deaf, I didn't know \"Shake It Up\" as well as I thought I did and after watching a short video clip I dance like Elaine from Seinfeld. It was ALL bad but I had a blast and we made some fun memories!

This place is small, very simple, the DJ was really good, it has indoor and outdoor seating and speakers so everyone can hear you singing. The gal checking ID's was also waiting on tables. She wore lots of hats yet was always of a sweet and friendly disposition."}
{"text":"Great karaoke night. Lots of fun. Never too aggressive but everyone is having a good time with great bartenders and nice servers."}
{"text":"This was a great first experience! Me and the fam sat inside and had the Brooklyn Bomber pizza, lemon pepper wings, honey hot Wings and an appetizer sampler. Spencer was great and very helpful! I strongly recommend the wings, especially the honey hot! For those meat lovers, the Brooklyn Bomber is the bizzness!"}
{"text":"We were clear that we had a flight to catch and the kid needed to eat. Credit to them for being open during Christmas, but they need to be clear about the wait.
They said half hour for wings and fries. An hour for pizza due to some oven issue(?), so we passed on that. Waited an hour anyway for the wings and fries and nearly cancelled the order. Had to rush the kid and stuff our faces. 
Food was \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a bite to eat and have some good drinks!lots of seating. Plenty of parking. Highly recommend. The gyros are to die for! Thank you for a amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Love 414, so much fun for awesome karaoke, pizza and I personally love their wings! If your looking for something more than just clubbing on mill Ave 414 has you covered. It is always a good time in there everyone is always so nice and over all just a great atmosphere. The staff is great, they all work so hard. Overall I would recommend 414 any day."}
{"text":"Superlative pizza! With or without the parmesan, oregano and peppers vailable at the table. Staff at bar and tables friendly and fast! Might be different as the evening crowd arrives but in the afternoon it's great for pizza and beer!"}
{"text":"It's a place that actually TRIES to be divey, which is something I really dig. The push towards something unusual on Mil Ave is a real thing here. The interior reminds me of the bars in Colorado, where you can just kick it, sing karaoke like shit, sip a few drinks and have a good time all around."}
{"text":"They just got a healthcode violation. I was there to witness the activity cited below:

They let customers back in the kitchen to make their own food. I overheard the owner tell a cook not to worry about healthcode violations at night because the health department wont be there to check. There was rough housing in front of the establishment with one person getting their head split open on the glass door. Management didnt think it was \"that big a deal.\" 414 pays their workers under the table but still takes taxes out of their checks even though zero is going to payroll tax. 414 encourages tip theft and has committed wage theft. The pizza is shit its cramped and the advertised drink specials are a lie. They will overcharge you if they see there's an opportunity to take advantage. Last but not least the place is so bad, the owner would rather go out and promote another bar taking business from his own restaurant to go run a karaoke night and advertise that on his restaurant's page! I would hate to be an employee or a regular and its disgusting that anyone off the street can just walk back in the kitchen and handle your food with their dirty ass hands. Enjoy that pizza though. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I recently went to 4one4 pizza on a Tuesday with a friend especially for karaoke. We had never sang at Karaoke and had to do it as a dare for a class project. We got there around 8:30ish and there were group of about 8 students outside with a mic singing in the top of their lungs. They weren't the greatest of singers, but then again neither were we. We looked at eachother and right away we knew that it was going to be a fun night. Inside, there was a table with 2 people sitting. The bar was only half filled. There was one bar tender, one waitress, and Brian the bouncer who was very nice. All the staff was really cool and friendly. The karaoke Dj was pretty good and had a pretty good singing voice, not too shabby. We stayed for 2 hours and got 2 songs in only because we didn't mind just chilling. We ended up singing No Doubt and Brittney and even got complimented by the students. The bouncer Brian happily took our photo while we sang and everyone singing was super nice. I got a couple of tips from the bouncer : there is a 1 hour wait to sing on Friday nights and a 2 hour wait in Saturday's. So, get your songs in quickly. The pizza looked delicious but I was on a diet and didn't eat. I should have though."}
{"text":"KInd of a strange place. They have their pizza slices way back in the corner of the bar, but since the pizza tastes like a par baked pie from Papa Murphy's, it might be a good location to hide those slices. The slices at HH should be $2 according to the sign, but they were actually 4 bucks. The dough wasn't undercooked, but it was soft and did not really resemble pizza from a pizza place, but more like a pizza on Pillsbury dough. I think the greek guys from next door run the place, so that could be the issue, but the beer was cold and there is a small outside patio to drink and people watch on Mill, but that is all I would do here next time."}
{"text":"It was alright. Cheap pizza but the slices were a bit small. 

Server was nice and greeted us right away"}
{"text":"Ok so was going to Spinellis Pizza right around the corner it was suppose to open at 10:30.  One of the employees was putting out tables said they would open at 11 am.  So it's Tempe I walked through a few shops came back at 10:55 & sat outside 11:05 still not open walked around corner 414 Pizza open.

 414 Pizza..The only downfall the coupon said 2 slices & drink $5.99.  Nothing on Coupon says it's M-F only.  But I'm craving a slice I go ahead pay $4 for a slice & added a drink that was almost $7.   The pizza was good one of the dudes who seems to be in charge was friendly told me about their wings.  All said & done I gave 4 stars probably would've given more had the coupon been accurate.  I went ahead & got a pizza a wing combo to from another coupon from what they had put on our doors at the complex.  I ordered the 1 topping 12 Pizza plus 10 wings for $15.99.  I choose meatball & the traditional hot wings."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was okay, if you pay you should pay with cash. I left my card there and asked to see if they could look for it for me. The server responded with \"we are really busy can I call you back\" I don't think she even looked."}
{"text":"The Philly cheese steak is a sorry excuse for food. I ordered UBER eats and received a soggy and practically meatless sub. They didn't have their daft punk steak fries so they give me regular fries! It sucks being disappointed when you once had a delicious meaty philly from here once upon a time ago and now i get skimped for $12 and booking fee. Last time I order here!"}
{"text":"Not good. Pretty sure I got totally different wings from what I ordered (mild sauce which was supposed to be on the side) might have been hot garlic but only took a bite because it was too salty. Couldn't bite into the jalapeño in the poppers or even stab them with a fork because they were so tough. Delivery was fine but the food was overpriced and, in my opinion, not good."}
{"text":"This place is great! The owner is serious about having a good time, and the pizza crust is SO FUCKING TASTY!!"}
{"text":"Ordered:
\"Hot Stuff\" My Calzones, Small Pizza Bowl

Delivery Fee: $5. I live quite far away so I am ok with it.

When I received the order, I was confused on what was supposed to be the Pizza Bowl. I called (around 12am last night) and spoke to a woman who explained how both items I ordered should look. She was very helpful. 

Small Pizza Bowl -- I was disappointed about this item and do not think it is worth the $9.50 spent. It tasted great, however, I thought with a name that had pizza in it there would have been some bread under the cheese or on the side. Instead, it is just cheese with the selected toppings.

\"Hot Stuff\" My Calzones -- $10 is about $2 more expensive for the size of the calzone, however, once I bit into it, I quickly disregarded the price and considered it worth it. I chose artichokes as my topping. The artichokes were soft and enough were in it to add to the overall flavor w/o overpowering the rest of the calzone. The calzone was the right size for a single serving meal and it completely satisfied me. 

I gave a review of four stars instead of five due to the pizza bowl. You should add in the description that it does not include bread for those that have never had it before."}
{"text":"This place on Mill Ave was serving food all night and we were able to get a pizza at 12:30 AM.
The service and employees were good. They are kind of expensive compared to other pizza places and it took about 18 minutes to get the pizza after ordering. Which wasn't that bad at all. There was karaoke that everyone in the place could participate in. It really had a lively atmosphere. The place was relatively clean."}
{"text":"What a great place. I live in San Tan Valley, but it's worth the drive for good food, good beer, and no nonsense Karaoke. MUST GO!"}
{"text":"If you like bomb pizza and great service this is your place, 'cause- DAMN. I came here with a friend for lunch before leaving Phoenix and I was super impressed by the service, wings and pizza. 

At first I was super hesitant because no one was here for lunch on Sunday- the place wasn't as \"fancy\" as the other surrounding restaurants, but I wanted pizza and I wanted it BAD.
So we decided not to walk nine miles to the next pizza joint since NYPD was closed. 

Jason was our server/ bartender and coming from someone who has worked in fine dining establishments- he was great. We ordered water because we both had to drive 2 plus hours and while most servers/ bartenders would have tried to up-sell or gotten annoyed with this choice- Jason simply brought them out AND refilled them at the halfway point EVERY time.  

Ok, it's not like we had our table de-crumbed and our napkins folded, but his willingness to satisfy, be helpful with the menu (not to mention find me jalapenos if there weren't any on hand) and refill our water? If you don't tip this guy 30+ percent after an experience like that? You're horrible. 

We ordered a pineapple, jalapeno and pepperoni pizza- yes we are weirdos and we understand that. Moving on, it was GLORIOUS. The pineapple was actually pineapple CHUNKS and the other toppings weren't skimped either.
The wings were \"on fleek,\" and beyond what I expected both in sauce and chicken quality/size. 

Look, I get one cheat meal a week so maybe I'm not a connoisseur of pizza and wings- but um I'm sure we chose wisely."}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if that was an option. The food was terrible. I ordered off eat24 which gave me an estimated delivery of 45-60min. After waiting impatiently for almost an hour and a half my order finally arrived. I opened it up to find burnt garlic knots ( total waste of money right off the bat) i couldn't even eat them. I went on to eat the wings id ordered. These were supposed to be buffalo wings but had no buffalo sauce on them, they were not hot nor fresh and as i tried to eat them the meat was dry. I got old celery and carrots along with the order. Thanks :( for the $21 that i paid i hardly got what I paid for. I would never eat here again nor suggest anyone else to for that matter. Its a shame that i paid my hard earned money for bs ass food that i cant even eat. Now i still have to go to sleep starving because i cant eat the bs i just ordered."}
{"text":"Only stopped in for drinks, but not a bad spot! Decent drink selection with unique cocktail names - Lady Gaga Killer tasted like a legit melted jolly rancher of you have a sweet tooth.  We came to this restaurant as we thought it was associated with Wisconsin with 414.... opportunity for management to pull in the snowbirds!"}
{"text":"I came here once for karaoke, that was fun. Came back a second time to actually eat and that was a BIG mistake. I got there at 6:30pm on Friday night with 2 friends and we were the only table in there. I asked the server(Adriana or Ariana I believe was her name) if there was a happy hour, she looked at me confused and goes \"uhm no.\" I happened to glance at the napkin holder and saw that they do have one and corrected her by letting her know they did. Her response was \"oh my gosh, is it that time already?!\" Mind you....happy hour starts at 3pm so it had been \"that time\" for 3 and a half hours already. I ordered 3 green tea shots($5 each---and they were actually pretty good) and I noticed they had a sampler for $10 with options like mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, daft punk fries, mushroom cups and a couple others. We weren't sure what the daft punk fries were so we asked the girl if she could let us know. She didn't know what they were, walked over to another menu to see if she could find a description-if there was one on the menu we wouldn't have asked her, then she goes into the kitchen and asks the chef, comes back to our table and said that they were just plain fries with sauces on the side. We ended up ordered the sampler with mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, and daft punk fries with cheese whiz. Food comes to the table and the server goes, \"oh no! They forgot the mozzarella sticks, ill be right back!\" I looked at the food, pointed at the mozzarella sticks and said \"they are in the basket with the jalapenos poppers, but why are there only 3 sticks and 3 poppers?\" Her response was \"I am pretty sure you are missing some. let me go get them and ill be right back\" She comes back to the table and tells me \"The chef said that since this was a sampler, you only get a little sample of the food. if you want the whole order you will have to order it separately.\" ARE YOU FRICKIN KIDDING ME. My response when I left the restaurant, \"if you want a good tip, you give good service.\" Not ok. and not happy. I also do not recommend coming here if you want any good food or service. I spent $30 on 3 shots and a half assed appetizer only to watch the waitress play on her phone, and ask questions to other staff that I was asking her. The karaoke DJ did a better job than the staff here."}
{"text":"Spencer has this place dialed in with pizza and karaoke . Great place to let your hair down or your freak flag fly any time of the week . Awesome food and people inside . Staff is always friendly . Check out that cute ass boy Kory working the the bar in the evenings Friday- Sunday too . Great dude gets ya where you need to be before ya go up to sing . Man 414 is a blast and a half ."}
{"text":"We ended up at this place due to a $20 groupon and got some chicken wings. The wings were fine, definitely not 2lbs as described on the menu, but whatever. Water is self serve and they give you the smallest imaginable plastic cups, forcing you to interrupt dinner to make several water runs (first world problems, I know, but still annoying). If you need anything you will have to waive down your waiter.  

This place is advertised as a Karaoke place, so I won't count the horrendous music against it. But truly, the loud singing was almost unbearable.  

The reason for the two star rating, opposed to a one star rating, is that I can imagine this to be a good stop for anyone after a night of partying looking for a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm not typically the person who writes the bad review . . . but I've gotta say that I really wish I'd just had a bowl of cereal and called it a night.

Boyfriend and I were exhausted from a rough day/week and pretty hungry. We ordered from 414 because they'd left a flier on our door. They had a special: an 18\" pizza with one topping and garlic knots for $13.99. Not bad. We were told it would arrive in 35-45 minutes--also decent for a Thursday night 3 miles away.

An hour later I called back to ask what happened. Apparently they were pretty backed up, and they'd be sending an extra pizza along free of charge because of the wait. Okay, I figured, everyone gets backed up sometimes--not a big deal.

But I guess \"a little backed up\" means \"Don't expect your pizza to show up for almost 2 hours.\" And of course I was willing to forgive that, but then I opened the boxes. The pizzas were mangled, totally squished, as though someone had held the boxes under an arm on their way up to our door. (I'll post a photo.)

Of course everything was cold--goes without saying. Hot, it would've been a decent pizza. The garlic knots were doughy and the dipping sauce tasted canned.

And to add insult to injury, they'd charged us for two toppings instead of one because I asked for half mushrooms, half olives (which makes one whole pizza, so one topping, in my opinion--debatable). So I got overcharged.

I'll be calling the manager tomorrow. At least the delivery kid was nice. And the only thing that could make this experience worse is if we wake up with food poisoning in the morning (pray for us)."}
{"text":"Last night in Tempe. Just went sight seeing just so happened the only place we walked into was the spot we parked directly in front of . It was karaoke night and you can hear it from outside. Who doesn't like karaoke right. So we had a couple of beers. The atmosphere was great. A nice melting pot of Tempe locals. My go to karaoke is \"Delilah\" by plain white T's. Don't as me why lol. But everyone was singing along with me, that was cool. I recommend this spot, almost didn't walk in but I'm glad we did. Tell me what u think..."}
{"text":"I come to 414 at least once a week! The food is delicious, the drinks are great and reasonably priced. Karaoke is my favorite part, Spencer goes out of his way to make sure everyone is having as much fun as possible! I've never encountered such a wonderfully multifaceted human."}
{"text":"I took our new employees out for a welcome dinner on Tuesday evening and we wanted to end the night with something fun. I contacted Spencer who helped us get all the information so we could come in for karaoke. They were excellent hosts and my team had a great time. We only had cocktails and sang so I can't speak to the quality of the pizza but I look forward to trying it."}
{"text":"The short review....NO.  Don't order here.....

I wasn't bummed out when it took two hours to arrive. (I live 2 miles away)
I wasn't bummed out when it arrived cold. 
I wasn't bummed out when the delivery kid was a total asshole.

I was pissed when I actually saw my food.  

If you like receiving a single chicken nugget slathered in Siracha when ordering 1/2 dozen hot wings your gonna love this place. (Literally a single chicken nugget about half the size of a golf ball)

If you love a measly portion of uncooked pasta and a single piece of meatball (read actual part of a meatball) slathered in store bought sauce, your probably gonna love this place.

If you like still frozen walmart cheesecake squirted with some kind of strawberry jam, your probably gonna love this place.

That and the fact that this was stupid expensive....I will continue ordering from Rosattis and more reputable places.

They did offer to give me a credit, but seriously why would I ever try this again....the service was bad, the food was much worse...."}
{"text":"New and improved!!! The owner who has taken over 414 has done such an amazing job setting a positive and lively atmosphere! Drinks are cheap and good and the pizza is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent find!! It was a Groupon we purchased and SO worth it!! I highly recommend this place. Great food and service!! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza ever! There wasn't any part that was good. The sauce was gross, the cheese didn't even cover the whole pizza, the pepperoni (which was $2 extra) was very sparse and overcooked. I wish I could go back in time and not order from this place. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Not really my type of place. Mill let alone is pretty bad during the day, lots of people asking for change.. This little spot was a quick pizza stop. The service is 4 out of 10. About 80% of the time the bartender was in her phone (even while other customers were walking in). Not very welcoming. The wings were Great! Def up there. As for the pizza, it's nothing special, the same flat pizza found everywhere else on mill. Prolly won't be back, you guys should def work on your customer service."}
{"text":"loved there 90s music! they were quick to get us a table but the server was rude when asking to split the check between couples."}
{"text":"Ordered deliver.  Got order 90 min later bc they only had 1 driver and had no clue when she was going to be back. Manager was kind enough after multiple call backs to deliver it herself. 

Pizza was undercooked- doughy, had zero flavor, awful. Don't order the mushroom appetizer or the garlic knobs. Super disappointed in the entire experience minus the managers attempt to help which was decent."}
{"text":"if you love the following: karaoke, pizza, cheap alcoholic drinks and beer, daily drink and food specials, friendly and attentive bartenders and servers.  This is the place for you!  I was only doing karaoke one night of the week at another local bar I will not mention, and found that it was a waste of my time and money, plus I was cabbing there and back home. 414 is a walk from where I live, and they offer everything I like, every night of the week.  I am able to do karaoke on my nights off from work, and I don't get weekends off. this place has the most awesome staff I have ever encountered on mill ave.  Spencer is the karaoke host/d.j. and also the general manager or owner I believe... he is super friendly and attentive to your needs, even if you are a little tipsy, he will not ignore you!  he wants you to come back to his business, and he wants you to have a fun night, every time.  I have introduced this place to my friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers.  they all have good things to say as well, and enjoyed their time, and ask me if we can go back again sometime soon!  I'm so proud of this business, and will continue to be a loyal customer.  I forgot to mention that I've never had a bad experience here with any of the other customers.  no creepy dudes, no fights, everyone having a good time singing and dancing together.  I feel safe and maybe it's because of their security guards (front and back doors), they're on it!  I've met so many nice people here, and can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I ever had. If you like sandwiches and pizza come on to this place. Great place to hang chill sing karaoke . have a good time. I barely started coming to this place, And I got to say I love it. Thanks to Stunna and Spencer for a great place to chill and hang out and have good times."}
{"text":"Dave, the manager and cook, is a great guy. Outgoing and works well with customers. A lot of drug users come through here (usually as delivery drivers) and they turn over people faster than anywhere I have ever seen. The bartenders are generally pretty great with the exception of a couple weirdos, and even then they are tolerable. Not the place to come if you are disrespectful or if you are looking to be bowed down to. Great deals, 2 slices and a soda for $5 or 2 slices and a beer for $7, cheapest on Mill Ave, period. Beers are priced well (definitely better than Mellow Mushroom down the road, but their pizza isn't quite as good), wings are great and the chicken caesar salad is my favorite. This is my regular pub, and will remain that way for some time."}
{"text":"First of all this review is not about the food.. (the wings were great as always). Anyways, tonight I ordered some wings for delivery. As I'm waiting in my house I all of a sudden hear music BLASTING outside. I knew it wasn't my roommates because of the terrible choice of music. After a couple minutes the music was still blasting. Thinking it was my stupid neighbors I walk outside except right when I open my door your delivery guy was standing at the door and I find out that it was his music.. if your drivers are going to wake up the entire neighborhood at least do it with some good music."}
{"text":"Decent enough pizza.  Prompt service.  Good pizza lunch deal.  It looks like some tough reviews for this place, but honestly they didn't seem bad at all when i stopped in.  Way more seating than some of the other pizza places on Mill.  Way less grimy/grungy than the other pizza joints too.  

The guy working behind the counter even offered to swap out my soda for a to-go cup when I paid my bill.  I'll certainly give them another shot."}
{"text":"I waited over an hour then went to the counter and they told me \"we're just getting started on it give us 10 minutes\" as well as us sitting at a table with a thing of Parmesan and the waitress says to us \"I need those\". Outrageously slow service and forgetting about expensive orders??? Don't come here. Waste of money and horrible service. Didn't even order drinks wasn't worth it. Waited another another hour and then when I asked for a refund the guy says \"you keep talking I'm giving you a refund but you're messing me up with you talking\" take New York off your name. Horrible horrible horrible service. Don't ever come here."}
{"text":"I met The own we working at My job. He invited me to check out his establishment. I took my son in and was Very pleased with the service. 

Service-- Quick, efficient, polite, (I was served by a great bartender )  even the cooks came out to confirm With me my order. Very accommodating when I gave the bartender a run for his money requesting these outrageous drinks that no one in Arizona orders  I figure I bust his balls a little while I'm here. And he maintained such a great attitude. 

Food-- Amazing Pizza. Perfectly cooked. Crust was Aldente and not At all Doughy or chewy. Sauce was Not too acidic, salty, or overly sweetened. Perfectly cooked. Garlic Parmesan Was A MUST have for wing sauce.  meat balls were perfectly cooked and seasoned enough so that I did not need marinara sauce. I had the Cookie for desert, it was nice and warm chewy and I got some ice cream with it. 


Atmosphere-- Very inviting. Nice white leather round booth seatings. Perfect lighting and a nice air flow threw front and back entrance. Not at all Stuffy. Great set up and very spacious. 


Bar set up-- not much beers on tap but just enough people to have a Few. Nicely organized able to see almost everything they offered. Not very many stools but with an establishment so cozy you'd probably grab a booth anyway.    


Recommendations-- Keep up the great work hopefully the people next door leave so u can extend I'd love to see what else can happen there with a bigger venue"}
{"text":"After my last experience, I was contacted by Spencer who I'm assuming is a manager or owner at 414. He apologized for my bad experience and offered to make it right by sending me a free pizza or dessert. 
The process was very simple, and everyone I dealt with was very friendly and attentive. I requested a supreme pizza, and it arrived hot and fresh. I've just tasted it and it's definitely one of the better pizzas I've had in Tempe. 

I feel very satisfied with my experience and willing to give them my business in the future. I really appreciate that they were willing to go above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction as a customer. It means a lot."}
{"text":"Great experience every time. They have a green tea shot that is wonderful! The pizza is awesome and the staff are always friendly"}
{"text":"Just ordered their pizza slices and sampler platter tonight. Holy huge servings! The slices are $3.00 each and are HUGE! Then the sampler platter serving sizes are crazy big. The cheese bread with it is a full serving and the pizza rolls are pretty big themselves. The cheese fries didn't have much cheese.. But they were pretty decent fries still. Pizza was delicious! This was all $20.00/ $24.00 with my tip. We will definitely be ordering here. SO cheap and it's dinner and lunch the next day for 2 people."}
{"text":"Third time here and I love the atmosphere.  Great food and Spenser is so fun!  We enjoy the food and the karaoke."}
{"text":"Holy Shit! I went to mill and found the best pizza place ever! Best thing is they are open till 4 am. Had the pizza and also some wings. EFFING AMAZING! Service was quick and the prices were awesome. I will definatley be coming back."}
{"text":"made a quick trip to phoenix in may and was looking for places to eat. had a restaurant.com gift certificate and decided to try 414 pub and pizza. it was awesome. Got the 24\" pizza and the 2lbs of wings. everything was great. going back this week and planning on stopping by for lunch."}
{"text":"I never really actually ordered from here but decided to tonight. Overall, it was not good. The food was about 10 mins late due to the delivery driver not going through the gate when he had access. Pizza was decent.. Not the best, just plain. I ordered a cookie/ice cream combo. The cookie was so burnt that I couldn't eat it. Definitely a waste of $$. Take it elsewhere.."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but the sauce was much spicier than your average pie.  The pizza was also cheaper than expected, though the beer was not.  The real problem was the garlic knots, they were a total waste of money.  Karaoke started at 8pm on Friday night and it did not take long for it to get loud and raunchy."}
{"text":"Floor management has improved over the last few months. Still a few minor hiccups along the way as far as karaoke rotation is concerned, but the servers and bar-tending staff are friendly and helpful most nights. I had a not-so-pleasant visit a few months ago, but decided to give it another try after hearing the last floor manager had been removed. I came in with a girlfriend to celebrate our birthdays. Had a good time. Sadly, coordination for our 'birthday surprise' was extremely poor, so we didn't receive the birthday event promised...but still a step up from the last time. I will return as a regular."}
{"text":"Decent food. Good service. Nice place to chill. College crowds."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last night (skeptical of how a bar could pull off doing karaoke 7 times a night without being terrible) & I had a blast!!
Our server was absolutely amazing, she did not let a single one of our drinks run dry & CONSISTENTLY checked up on us, ever after being there for three hours. Our table mates ordered an annoying amount of water multiple times (former bartender here) & she brought it with a smile. I really wish I could have gotten her name, she was young with dark brown hair and a long ponytail. I really appreciated how welcome she made us feel the whole night."}
{"text":"We did not eat only Drink and sing. That being said we were probably the most sober people there and we had a blast. They have a crazy crew of Karaoke singers. Some of the best I have ever heard and some can just dance their asses off. 

The place is a dive, the drinks were poured properly, not too much not too little. Good prices. 

The karaoke sounded really good. (except the outdoor speaker) the KJ (owner?) was gracious, inviting and did a good job keeping the system rolling."}
{"text":"The cook forgot the pepperoni on the pizza, not under the cheese not over the cheese lol other than that it was fabulous great music cold beer and a beautiful and delicious pizza dough with crisp crust! The wings were crispy and juicy. Definitely a great price point for the service and quality"}
{"text":"This pizza was the worst I've had. It didn't even have any sauce on it. We would have had better luck making a frozen pizza. We ordered delivery and the pizza was $30 and it was cold when it got here. The delivery driver couldn't figure out how to get inside the gate of the apartment community so I had to go out front to meet him. Even though I had opened the gate for him he still didn't drive through to my apartment. He called me again and said he was still waiting up front for me. Seriously? I wouldn't consider it delivery."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place, they have awesome food and the best karaoke in town. The staff is very friendly and no matter how busy they get they still provide quick service."}
{"text":"As a 37 year old, I stay away from Mill as much as possible but got a flyer in the mail for this place and ordered delivery.  All we have gotten so far is pizza but the 5 times we have, each time we get different types and have loved each one of them..  They make one he'll of a pizza and have found a loyal Friday night delivery out of my family.  We have found a few pizza joints in the past that we have loved only for them to cutting costs after they get their fan base.  Every one of them is now out of business.  Please don't change."}
{"text":"Do NOT  eat here until further notice! We saw a rat in there and my friend threw up!   (pic attached). 

I saw something move and I thought maybe it's just a bird but I kept my eyes on it. Next thing I know, I saw a tail swoop down and then I saw it hop and scurry across the ceiling area, before making its way above the middle table where people were sitting! I kept thinking to myself, \"Please don't let it drop out of the sky! I would freakin' scream and jump on the booth so fast!\"

I let the waitress know and she let the bearded security guy know. I showed him and he said \"I see it,\" very nonchalantly! I have that recorded on my phone in addition to the waitress telling me that the owner was called, the building is old, and I will receive a 15% discount. The food didn't get finished by the way either. 

IF YOU ASK ME, THAT FOOD SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE JUST FOR US NOT CAUSING A SCENE AND CREATING CHAOS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT LAST NIGHT! It could have gotten pretty bad... 

Instead, I kept my eyes on the rat while my check was printed and we left out. The waitress did give me a cup of water for my friend who threw up.

THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO ACT AS THOUGH NOTHING WAS WRONG AND KEPT THE PARTY GOING AS IF THERE WAS NOT A RAT RUNNING AROUND ABOVE!!!

So.... last night I sent the owner Spencer a message (pics attached) letting him know that I saw a rat in his restaurant and he said \"Yes thank you, one of our neighbors was infested and now has driven them over to us. We know about the problem and are working with our pest control company to try to fix asap. Thank you very much for the heads up and I hope it didn't ruin your evening. 
Thank you, 
Spencer.\"  

WAIT A MINUTE! So you mean to tell me that YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS ISSUE and food is still being cooked and served there?! Blaming the neighbors does not justify this unsanitary practice! Plus the waitress said it was because the building was old so that's contradicting..... 

Anyways, then I looked up the business to see if anything prior happened and it showed they had 5 violations last year, that the news reported but it didn't have anything to do with rodents 

...........

(Beginning of night) When we first walked up we tried to walk right in quickly but were stopped at the patio by this lady to show our IDs. She was smoking and I've never been around something SO strong, I literally had to back far away and hand her my ID. She said I didn't have to move so far back but I let her know it was the cigarette. Did I already mention it was SUPER strong?

The waitress was nice and the food was good enough for a late night meal, so we have no complaints there. 

THEN I LOOKED UP.... (you read what happened from there) lol"}
{"text":"I decided to order room service and had a taste for pasta. I stumbled upon this place thanks to the Tempe takeout. The Alfredo pasta and graham cracker cust cheesecake was AMAZING!! I was upset that I didnt give a better tip! I called to compliment them and spoke with a great guy named Spencer. 
Before heading back to LA I'm taking a trip to the 414!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza here through grub hub figured it would be a decent experience.. pizza is pizza right?  Absolutely not.  No issue with the online order.  That worked perfectly.  Ordered it for delivery.  

Delivery is where the issues began.  First off, the delivery \"driver\" called to tell he was in the area, but having a hard time finding my house.  So my friend went outside with my phone to flag him down.  Disclaimer*** I was recovering from surgery from a broken leg.  The rest is that he comes walking up to the house, not driving, and mentions something about his bike and that he is half blind so he cannot see well at night.  Why is this person \"driving\" for you if that is the case.  That is just the delivery and service itself.

Next, to review the food.  We ordered the Garlic Knots, White Pizza, and a Caesar Salad.  The salad was pretty much the only tolerable part.  The knots were doughy and lacked a good amount of garlic.  The white pizza arrived cold and pretty much inedible. Grease marks littered the top of the box.  Made me question the delivery method even more.

Either way, it was horrible.  They never answered their phone, which was fun to find a way to get in touch with them about their food and lack of service.  Would avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Came with a couple of coworkers, great quick service from the bartender \"Kory\". Reasonable prices. This karaoke bar has some very good singers so you forget you're at a karaoke bar at times. The pizza was delicious. Different from other mill bars and has a very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I don't usually like writing negative reviews, but after my experience with the food here I had to. The pizza lacked flavor and was very greasy and almost spongy. And the appetizers were bland and honestly a let down. Save your money and order from spinelli's down the street."}
{"text":"The fries were really mushy and felt like slush in my mouth. The sub I had tasted like a glorified hot pocket. The drinks were fine. Overall, not a place to write home about."}
{"text":"The Pizza was amazing but they did not honor the Yelp discount. The delivery girl was awesome as well. The pizza arrived hot and fresh. SHe even took the time to try and talk to the owner about the discount. He just continued to refuse."}
{"text":"Will never return. Felt mocked by the bartender when my friend ordered a Hennessey and my friend is black... kept making comments about Hennessey  (weird vibe) never again. Didn't even try the food."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place on mill or anywhere. It's a restaurant/bar/karaoke bar so you've got many options here. My boyfriend and I like to eat dinner and watch all of the karaoke singers. The golden spice wings are some of the best I've ever tasted and cheaper (and BIGGER) than most wing restaurants. All of the staff members I've encountered here are great and they make sure we are taken care of."}
{"text":"great pizza , the crust was really light and had a crispy bottom , not soggy like some pizza.
the service was good and the waitress was super cute and friendly.
i will definitely be back and will recommend the pizza and wings..
oh yeah the music was on point it was as though they had my play set ."}
{"text":"Con you at the door by giving you a voucher for a \"free slice\". It's pretty much an 1/8th of a slice of pizza. What a joke"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. We requested a song. DJ thought he was funny and said he wouldn't play our song until we tipped him. The song eventually played and we saw the employees grab our mic to sing OUR song??? And then wouldn't give us the mic.... HORRIBLE and unprofessional employees"}
{"text":"Awesome place, awesome food, possibly the worst bartender ever (Cory). Poured nothing but mixer in a sex on the beach (I know it's fruity but there should be at least as much alcohol as sugar; soda would have been a better buy). I even offered more money for a touch more liquor and he just argued about the ingredients. Also told my friend the beer taps were \"only for decoration\" and not in a flirty way."}
{"text":"The sub was ok, the garlic knots aren't garlicky, 3 bucks for a 20 oz soda was disappointing. Delivery was fast. I won't order again, I might stop in and sit down to eat and try it again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I have been craving a Philly cheesesteak for the longest time. While I have no idea what a great philly consists of, I know what I like and that is extra cheese and lite pepper and onion. I stopped in and everyone was friendly and greeted me.

I came of course with my difficult annoying order; a philly with extra, extra provolone, no cheese whiz, mushrooms, lite bell pepper, lite onion, and bacon. The young lady who took my order was very sweet, but I doubted her because she didn't write my order down. I was nervous, but I was hungry and hoping for the best.

So the wait was a little long because it was lunch time and the place only had 3 other customers. They did offer me a drink and that was considerate. The young lady accidentally brought my food out to eat in and I asked her to make it to go, but I got to look at it before she walked away and what I saw was the most beautiful sandwich I had payed my eyes on.

I hurried back to the office and the sandwich was perfect! The fries were seasoned so deliciously. She got my order right and I should not have doubted her. It was so gooey and cheesy with a perfect amount of onion and bell pepper not overwhelming, but great flavor. The bacon was a nice touch too. I am such a picket eater and I'm not proud of that, but I appreciate when I can get what I want and not feel like I wasted my money.

I would definitely suggest giving 414 a try. I will be back for pizza and appetizers next time and of course my custom Philly."}
{"text":"Good pizza and prompt friendly service.  Staff was attentive and my waiter made sure we were happy. They even changed the channel so we could watch a game."}
{"text":"If you ask my kids this is the BEST pizza they've ever had. I can't deny it's up there in my top three. We love the writing on the walls and the option for boneless wings. When we walked in it was a Saturday around 4pm. Not another soul eating, but a few guys drinking at the bar. We had a drink orders taken pretty quick, but after that we waited for over 20 minutes for the person working to take our order. He was more focused on his cell phone and filling the Alcohol of one of the gentlemen. If it had taken much longer we may have left, but the food is so great we stayed I. Hopes that it was just an off day. We were not disappointed. I only wish they had one on our side of town in the west valley. I've also been at night with friends after work and had a blast singing karaoke and watching everyone enjoy themselves. Definitely more of a night time scene."}
{"text":"I love their Chicken Wings and pizza.  Great place and the fact they deliver high quality food makes it even better."}
{"text":"There are better pizza places than 414. In this day and age with various food allergies you would think they would have more options like gluten free, but they don't. Also I thought it was pretty tacky that their delivery person slices the pie in the middle of the restaurant. They get a C for effort on service. Don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and at $2 a topping I expect generous amounts of toppings, especially mushrooms which aren't exactly gourmet or expensive. I waited over 1.5 hours, call Yelp support  and am told they never got my order. Then a knock on the door...pizza's here! yippee, I'm hungry and I open the box and ONLY HAVE 5 MUSHROOMS AND TEENSY PEPPERONIS? FOR $40??? FOR A MEDIUM PIZZA? Oh this did include delivery, tip and dessert btw, a tiramisu which was tiny, flavorless and not worth it."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday (10/12) about 6:00 pm. Sat on the patio. Initial service was okay, but it went down hill fast. Only ever saw 2 dudes at the bar, no other customers than my daughter and I on the patio.  Had to wait at least 20 minutes for a beer refill, she said she forgot, um no one else is here! The wings were good, the garlic knots were not.  Some street freak who was obviously on something came and sat and the end of our table. The server never asked the guy anything, or asked him to leave, he just sat there staring at us, when we left he started following us so we went in the candy store next door. They get 2 stars because we had a Groupon and the cost was reasonable, however, will never go back."}
{"text":"Super friendly service with the nfl games through house pa sounds awesome. Got wings and a Philly cheesesteak with bloody Mary's and bloody beers. Service was on it. Nice open air environment in this great weather was appreciated. 

Will definitely be back for more nfl football!!!

Was great portions.  And great prices."}
{"text":"There are many reasons as to why I'm never coming back to this so-called \"pizza pub.\" First of all, service has been declining ever since it came into new management. The food is utterly mediocre since it's not made fresh and the ingredients are dismal! The pizza dough, which is made elsewhere, is delivered at night in front of everyone and not discreetly distributed from the back patio, which is very tacky and unprofessional. The only good thing about this place, which is the only reason that I gave it a one star, is the Karaoke, which has also been on a downward spiral. Due to some recent events as to how my entourage was treated in, I've taken the initiative to make this bar known for it's horrendous service towards the public and previous loyal clientele such as us. May this be a lesson to the new management team who run this business, as others will be posting similar reviews in the future regarding their practices."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a group of friends and had a great time at karaoke. The food isn't amazing, but the atmosphere made up for it. Apparently they have karaoke every day of the week. That makes this place the spot to go for anyone looking for a new bar for karaoke. I highly recommend 4one4 if you're looking for a good time in a Friday night!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza sub and when I got it delivered, it was the tiniest sandwich I had even seen.  That was NOT a pizza sub, that was a pizza sandwich with one tiny layer of meat, very little sauce and two inches of bread.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited 4one4 Pizza recently. The food was pretty good and the server was friendly and very efficient. Now for the bad part: the music in this place is absolutely deafening. We had to shout at the server (who was only about two feet away) just to place our order. There are enormous speakers everywhere, including at least one hanging from the ceiling. My ears were ringing after we left. I'd love to return because we liked our pizza and salad, but there's no way. I just couldn't tolerate the noise again. If non-stop, high-decibel, throbbing music doesn't bother you, then you'll probably like this place."}
{"text":"I always order delivery.... iv never actually been to the restaurant, so my review is based solely on that. This is one of my favorite places to get Really good food, at late hours of the night....I Order the delivery to my shop Pleasure World since we're open 24 hours it's hard to order from any other place...I always have the nicest delivery service, and food has always been 100% on point!!!  And you can't beat the prices!!!  I  supporting local business - and this one is worth the try... trust me"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in the Tempe area.  It's sooo much better than any other pizza place I've tried, which is pretty much all of them in the downtown/central Tempe area.  Venezia's is the only one that comes close and even that isn't quite as good."}
{"text":"Garlic Parm boneless wings were awesome.
Friendly bartender. It was a Saturday afternoon quiet and peaceful. Decent prices . Will be back"}
{"text":"414 is actually pretty awesome. Look at my other reviews and you'll notice I'm not only through and conclusive in my ratings but harsh sometimes too. My friends are like wow, if 414 impresses you...! 

I've only ever had the pizza slices they have under the heat lamps and the soda I guess. So my experience might be a bit different but I think it's the best grab and go thin crust style in the Phoenix area. I used to be all about \"Slices\" but now I'm like 414, 414! They have a great lunch special and pretty reasonable prices.

I've been about 8 times before and it's a nice place to relax, eat and not get bothered (ahem ladies) or party and have a laugh all night long. Security here is very personable and alert so that's good on Mill ave. I actually had an annoying recent experience which is why it gets 4 and not 5 stars. After Summer Ends music fest I got 2 slices and the prices were outrag-high plus I stood there for 10mins exhausted just staring until anyone talked to me and then waited another 10 to get my food *and* waited to pay. Points for not running off?

They also have karaoke which I hate, just loathe as a concept and I think most people can't sing, but a lot of band geeks and opera nerds trickle in from End Game bar to eat so you actually can get a better good show."}
{"text":"Such a fun place!
One of my girlfriends frequents this place for karaoke- she loves to sing and has the talent to do so (2 for 2!). So when it came time for her birthday, she wanted to celebrate here naturally with karaoke. It's a fairly small spot along prime Mill real estate with both outdoor and indoor seating. Outdoor seating includes speakers so all the world can hear ya when you sing! 

The indoor setup includes a full bar, food menu (mostly pizza), and a very attractive karaoke DJ with an extensive playlist of songs! I even pulled out of my hat some of the most random songs I know back from high school (to keep it TBT)- and he had them! 

A few of our friends got food and loved it. I didn't order anything except for drinks, I wasn't hungry. They pour the drinks well for the price! Maybe since I don't drink much anymore they tasted strong haha.

Call me a fan of 4one4, and know that I definitely will return."}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber Eats.  The pizza is soggy and veggies under cooked.  The wings were Sriracha teriyaki and mild but both were cooked well but not much flavor.  Not sure if eating in would be better but I would not order for delivery again."}
{"text":"If you have great qualities to sing, this can be one of your favorite places with great karaoke for those with a great voice, but also for those who sing badly. The sounds of this Karaoke have a good quality. The drinks are good and cheap in this place. The server that night was very nice, fast and very efficient.

I did not have a chance to eat here, but I am looking forward to take a bite of the menu when I come next time to AZ."}
{"text":"This was the ONLY place that was open & delivered around midnight when I was hungry and didn't want to drive anywhere.. some reviews seemed to be really good and some reviews seemed to be bad. But I was hungry so I gave it a shot. The pizza was really freaking good.. I love pizza with white sauce so I got the Blank Space Pizza .. I asked to add chicken which they did not but I still liked it anyways. I also got the garlic slip knots which were a little overcooked and hard.. for dessert I got The Tiramisu & that was pretty good .. for all 3 food items,  a 2 liter , & delivery fee I spent $29, and they arrived in about 30 minutes. Overall satisfied.  The garlic knots would've been good too if they weren't overcooked.  I couldn't see how other reviewers said there was no flavor because everything was flavorful in my opinion..  even the over cooked garlic knots."}
{"text":"Ahhhh talk about the best drinks ever!!! Jason was so fun and funny. I just peeked in the bar and he encourage me to come in with his humor! (Glad I did) the second I sat down he made sure I had everything I needed and encouraged me to try new drinks,That I will now take home and entertain my friends by the pool with!! Also thanks for recommending the pizza it's killer! You really hit it out of the park. I'll be back. Just for entertainment purposes."}
{"text":"i really like the atmosphere and the regular dj who is a ginger and the weekday dj who has a black hAIR/soulful voice are awesome what keeps me from giving 5 stars is the servers are too into themselves they talk and joke more than customer service i understand they're busy and packed but the food takes way too long to get out but i always see deliveries coming out real quick also if you're not there early/WEEKDAY  you're only going to sing 1 song the regular host caters to the regular karaoke people who are mostly theater ish college kids i get it they come every day but if i'm paying for food and service i'd like to sing more than one song and if the rotation gets long don't let the same people keep singing otherwise this is a great place and i'm sure you have a good time it's the only karaoke bar on mill ave as far as i know and the do have promo nights so that you can test some of their alcohol specials"}
{"text":"Ended up here after being unable to find the place we were looking for, so already disappointed. I got a veggie wrap for $4.99--average, and a order of fries for $2.99. Fries were good, but a smaller serving that you would expect for $3. 

Nice flat screens along the walls. Basic bar food at slightly above average prices. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"Have been here quite a few times. The most recent visit was Saturday during the ASU game. This place was pretty packed. I got myself a slice of cheese pizza and 4 pieces of pepperoni and a chicken Alfredo to take home for later and for my boyfriend. Total for everything was $25. They have big slices of cheese for $2 and the pepperoni $3. The pasta was HUGE and full of nice big pieces of chicken. The minus a star is because they have the music so loud that you literally have to scream to the guy taking your order. Yes it is Mill on a Saturday night, but they can have the music playing at a normal level and still have a god time."}
{"text":"I came here at 3am and ordered wings. They were very tasty and I was told they're cooked in peanut oil to keep it healthy. I would come here anytime to order these wings. And the pizza looked really good too. Maybe next time I'll get a couple slices."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  The 2 guys working were playing video games on the big screen tv.  I felt like we were interrupting.  I ordered a chicken ranch sandwich with a side salad.  It was mediocre, I've had better sandwiches at other places.  There are so many other restaurants in this area, skip this one and try a different one."}
{"text":"I used to go to Grapevine in Scottsdale but after a bad experience i had to find a new karaoke spot to go to on Tuesdays. And this is the one! The atmosphere is very chill, they have a very extensive song list and better food than my last spot (who doesn't like pizza) and it's affordable, my bill has never been so low at a bar!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The owner was funny and nice and came to our table! It was karaoke night and there were kids and he was VERY conscience that there were children in the place and made sure no one sang song with swear words! Very impressed! Atmosphere was fun! Food was great! Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! Checked it out because i heard they have karaoke every night! Its a small little bar with plenty of seating. Its kinda dark in there but it gives it a cool vibe. They have so many songs and karaoke host is great at keeping the crowd into it. There were so many great singers here so i was kinda intimidated to song, but screw it you only live once. It was so much fun. They have drink specials and my one kinda negative is the pizza by the slice.... They are thin paper thick slices, and they are expensive for what you get. It was just ok, my suggestion is get some dinner elsewhere before you come."}
{"text":"The worst pizza and god awful mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella stick was so bland it was disgusting. The pizza was burnt and absolutely just disgusting. Cheese didn't even cover the pizza. And they just put way to much sauce on it. This place is way to expensive too. You want to go to a better place for pizza go to Little Cesar's. People there are pretty nice. But the food disgusting. Definitely not coming here ever again."}
{"text":"It's kinda fun. Friendly folks.
Cheap drinks.
Same people hog the microphone song after song.
I didn't eat the pizza, but it doesn't look great. 
Awesome security.
No ambiance."}
