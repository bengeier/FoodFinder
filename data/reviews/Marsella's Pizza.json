{"text":"Love their pizza ... Always consistent ... As in consistently good!! They never skimp on the sauce or cheese !!"}
{"text":"Yum. My favorite local pizza joint. The sauce is delicious and they don't cover it with ungodly amounts of cheese. Nice crust and not too greasy."}
{"text":"Well I called this pizza place hoping it was everything everyone has made it out to be. Since my wife life isn't really a pizza person was hoping they may have something else to offer. Called and asked a few questions and the man that answered was very short, rude, and obviously having a bad day. One persons attitude shouldn't detour a customers desire to eat at there establishment. Poor customer service is the downfall of most establishments. Don't eat here. Go somewhere else were they want to make your experience a pleasant one instead."}
{"text":"The pizza I grew up on, well this and Mama Mia's which has been long gone for a while. When I worked at Medic (also gone for a while now) I used to order once a week. Usually it was pizza but if I was in the mood for something different I went with the shrimp dinner or chicken dinner. Couldn't go wrong with either. I only get Marsella's once in a while now as I live in Brunswick but every time it reminds me why I loved it as a kid. Great no frills pizza at a reasonable price. Give it a try...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've eaten lots of pizza in my lifetime and marsellas is In my top 3 for sure. Ingredients taste fresh and not frozen especially the cheese. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! We absolutely love this place. The chicken and veal parm subs are our go to choice. Pizza is great... But give the thin crust a try! They also have great wings and salads. A little pricy but very worth it!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 large - there was only a lite sprinkle of cheese on our pizza. Very disappointing to say the least . Skimp
And skimp and watch your business go down the tubes.  Why cut corners take pride in your pizza. Never again."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wing dings!!!!!! :) ask for Courtney Z to make it and it will be perfect!"}
{"text":"While the pizza is good I'm so disappointed in the customer service at this place.   It is the year 2018 and yet you need to have a printed out piece of paper with the special in order to get the pricing.  Doesn't matter I can show the special on my phone from their website.  I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Coming here from NY to visit my in-laws we happened to order from this little gem. The crust and dough were excellent, and the toppings were very fresh and generous. The overall size of the pie was a little small by N.Y. standards but 3 large fed 6 of us with some left over. The only criticisms of this place are 1) the do not put a lot of sauce on the pie, 2) they don't take American Express...good job with the food!!!"}
