{"text":"Great selection of foreign alcohol. Food is delicious, would probably go back just for the food"}
{"text":"Try \"Bulgogi Nachos\", a creative style of Nachos comes with thiny sliced beef, cheese, sliced peppers, onions and avocado sauce. 
Waitress/waiters were friendly overall, always with a lovely smile.
* Really don't like the interior design.
It's not a good idea for hanging wood sticks thickly dotted on the perspective of Fengshui."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. I know it's busy on friday and saturday night but waitresses gave no shit about our table, one of the waitress gave attitude most of the time. Haven't got this bad of service in a while and i'm not the kind of person to complain about the service since i'm also a waitress and I understand that its a hard job but it was horrible at a point where it ruined the night of all my friends including myself. At least, food wasnt not bad but people should some at least some effort when serving.."}
{"text":"Perfect place to hang out with friends with some amazing food. Vast selection of drinks and asian cocktails. The food is different from the main ganadara restaurant so it doesnt feel like eating the same things. The skewers set and the salmon dupbap is a must. 

The staff is friendly and nice and the service is great. The place is clean and the ambience is great. Highly recommended, especially if you like kpop :P"}
{"text":"It's a bar but they have excellent food. I cant speak of the restaurant of the same name down the street, but the food here really surprised me. I had the udon noodles and pork in creme sauce. It was like an alfredo sauce but the pork was just so tender. They also have skewers of meat you can order mix n match style, the meats were cooked well. They had a wide variety of drinks, but sadly I did not get the chance to try many because the service was really really lacking. The waiters never came over to take a second drink order once the food came. I had to flag the waiter down just to get a refill of water multiple times. It was so long and the place was empty! Maybe it was just a bad night, so I'm making a point to come back and try some of the awesome shaved iced desserts they have too."}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal, me and my wife went out for a walk searching for Soju after dinner. We found some restaurants who requires you to eat a meal in order to drink (huh!). We stumbled upon the Ganadara Restaurant on the other side of st-catherines and while they had Soju, there was a bit of a wait. When the waitress/hostess found out we were only looking to drink and not eat a meal, she pointed out the Ganadara Bar. We promply found the place and it was plesant from there on end. Its more like a Tapa's place where you can order small dishes on the side with your drink (perfect!). We tried to get the Lamb Rack but they were out so got the Lamb on skewer which was delish and we ordered some more of that. We also got our Soju and was very happy! In fact we returned the next night for some more. The atmosphere inside is HIP and the hostess/waitress and waiters are very polite and on top of their game. Next time we are in town, we will most def hit up this place!"}
{"text":"Brand new bar from the owners of Ganadara. Was pleasantly surprised that there was no line to get in and actually, not many patrons inside. I think this was due to the fact that there's no large sign outside and the interior is so dark, it looks closed from the outside. I came here hoping to have the perfect marriage of Ganadara's signature fast-food type Korean dishes with some good cocktails (and without the lineup that always seems to plague the original location!). I was a bit disappointed at first view of the menu, since the menu is limited and not what you get at the other location. They had two sushi items, a few salads, meat skewers and some main courses, four of which revolve around an udon noodle saute with various meats or vegetables. I ordered the beef udon saute; I will say it was very tasty. The beef was tender and not at all chewy and the noodles were the perfect firmness, but I do wish there were more veggies/additional ingredients or even more noodles to plump the dish up a bit. The fried chicken dish, however, was huge!!! Four large pieces of fried chicken were laid on a bed of cabbage and sliced lemon, and came with a spicy red sauce. This plate is perfect to share as an appetizer IMO. I tried the cumin lamb skewers, and while the pieces of lamb were generous, I found the seasoning not as addicting as the one at Otto. For dessert, they offer bingsu. The cocktails were surprisingly \"not\" disappointing. I say this because I generally find Asian restaurants or pubs to be weak on the cocktail front, in that they usually don't contain much alcohol and don't have much complexity. Here, the whiskey sour was pretty good. If it had just a tad more sweetness to it to give it that perfect sweet/sour mix, I would have probably given it an 8/10. Alcohol content was decent. Prices for both food and drinks are reasonable, but not super cheap. It will be interesting to see how this place picks up as a bar and snack spot, considering the other options around (Otto, Kinka, Kampai, etc). I wish them luck!"}
{"text":"It's a cool place to hang out get a beer and some light Korean tapas ! I feel the food is well priced but might be a hit or miss but definitely can't go wrong with their delicious fried chicken which definitely competes with the ramen bars in the are. Large prices of juicy chickens with medium crunchy batter on the outside!!!"}
{"text":"I really like their cold dishes.
The Botan ebi  (sweet shrimp) is amazing!
MUST TRYYY
Scallops sashimi dish alright. More sour than I expected.
Overall food is great!"}
{"text":"I only went once with friends, but the Espresso Bingsu (shaved ice) was great. It was a tirimisu in shaved ice form, it didn't come out frozen. There was a shot of espresso to pour into the bingsu. The bingsu was soft, no chunks of ice in it. There were lady fingers and cheesecake bits (they were larger than the size of their tony spoons) in addition to their shaved ice.

There weren't that many people inside when we went on a Saturday night, but it might also be because it's fairly new. It's pretty dark with music, but that's you would expect from a bar. But the hanging wood pieces looked really low, even for someone who's 5'3.

My only real complaint would be the price of the bingsu. After tax, a little over $10. It was good but it was a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday night. The set up was quite nice and the whole place had a Isakaya/lounge feel with a Korean accent. I definitely recommend reserving before going and also to take the sashimi platter. The sashimi was fresh."}
{"text":"We went to Bar Ganadara for a couple of drinks and Bingsu. 
The ambiance and decoration was very nice.
The service was horrible. 
Bingsu was ordinary."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here rather late looking for some late night eats and I'm glad we stumbled upon this place when it seems that there weren't many quality asian options open past 9:30/10pm. 

We were famished after a day trip to Tremblant and were looking for some carb-filled dishes. Luckily Ganadara just had the right things in their sauted bulgogi udon and their salmon dupbap (hoedupbap).

The udon still had very much the flavor profile of bulgogi and was more of a saucy version as opposed to a dry stir fried version. The noodles were nice and chewy and there were plenty of veggies. 

The dupbap was also pretty good. Their chogochujang was a bit off, as it was seemingly extra vinegary to the point it was almost on the cusp of sour. However, it was still was very much enjoyable. Just remember to mix the entire bowl for a more even tasting. And kudos for actually having spicy gochujang for once. 

I really liked the interior here, the tables/countertop were in a really unconventional manner but is aesthetically pleasing and works. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Went there after being disapointed by the food from another restaurant. We needed a quick fix and drinks to drink away our sorrows. Went there on a Saturday evening around 7pm, and we ended up leaving around 2am. I guess the ambiance was good so we stayed. 

At first, it was pretty empty. But as the evening/night got along, it started filling up, and around 11pm/midnight it was pretty full. Food-wise, we ordered a combo which included a plate of fried chicken with potatoes, bulgogi nachos and a bottle of soju, which was perfect for us to start the night. The food is comparable to their main restaurant Ganadara, which is like a block away and super hyped with line-ups all the time. Ambiance-wise, when full, it was alive and nice. Service was good also. 

Overall, asian food/snacks with asian drinks are a great combo!"}
{"text":"Like the music. It's a quite busy place, but waiters are trying their best to help you out.  Not many dishes are on the menu. I think they focus more on drinks instead of foods. A nice place to check out if you wanna try Korean drinks."}
{"text":"Really good and edgy korean bar. The food was really tasty and the staff was very nice. There is also a large selection of drinks to choose from. 

The bulgogi nachos were really good and I recommend them if you're not sure what to get (however the guacamole was meh).

The bingsoo is also really good and the portions were pretty generous."}
{"text":"I'm already a huge fan of Ganadara the restaurant, when I learned they were opening another branch as a bar concept, I was already sold! First time I went, it was at night and I think its the perfect time to experiment it. There's not as much food as the normal Ganadara because they focus more on drinks, but the short menu has some of the most exquisite things to eat AND add on sangria or a classic bottle of soju to with it ;). I totally recommend their fried chicken, it's heaven in a plate. I went there with some girlfriends to chill and drink, and the vibe is suuuper nice! The music is not to loud, the decor is majestic, the lounge music is soothing... Its a 10/10 for me! ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome Korean bar with a wide variety of cocktail and soju choices!! The interior is very nicely decorated and service is great! Bulgogi nachos, chicken wings, sashimi platter and bingsoo were sooo yummy, definitely recommend this place if you're into soju or looking for bar great for accommodating large groups."}
{"text":"Finished work late and decided to have a late dinner.
We ordered Chef's choice of sashimi, salmon ricebowl, bulgogi fried udon and skewers combo.

The sashimi combo is amazing!!! Freshness is a must and the Chef did took care of that! The best part of all, they serve the sashimi with ice underneath- it's detailed, but it ensure the freshness from the first piece to the very last.

The skewers combo is a fantastic idea, it gives you the chance to try a little bit of everything, I do wish the chicken skin to be a little bit more crispy but regardless, it's all very tasty."}
{"text":"First time visited this place in a Monday night. Surprised by their good food. Good Korean food. The portions are very generous for a bar."}
