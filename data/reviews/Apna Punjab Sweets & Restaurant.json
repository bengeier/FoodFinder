{"text":"Haven't tried the restaurant yet however the store alone is worth the five stars. Samosas are the best in town and enough of a selection of sweets it will take you a month to try them all. Lost count how many times I have stopped by to pick something up."}
{"text":"We by chance saw the sign to this restaurant on our drive home. This is the place to go for all sweet and Samosa lovers. They have all kinds of sweets and snacks. It's self serve so you can pick whatever sweets and snacks you need. But definitely a place to go. I would highly recommend this place to all people who have a sweet tooth. I love the Motichur Ladoos and Jamoon."}
{"text":"The food is great, and the price is reasonable.  They recently remodelled 2011.  The restaurant is small and they have an upstairs room for banquets.  The owners seem nice.  Great jalabi.  The buffet has a moderate selection of food (meats, veggi dishes, desserts and salads), which changes daily, and you get fresh hot naan.  They have a reasonable buffet take out.  They also have a very reasonable menu.  Our favorite, especially for the price."}
{"text":"You want to have a tongue orgasm? You want to know what heaven tastes like? You want to take your eyes on vacation to a place where they have the most colourful desserts on this planet?   You want to go to Apna Punjab Sweets & Restaurant.  This is how we do. Seriously, any time my family needs a mithai (Indian sweets) hook up, we come here.  Ask me how the food is, and I have NO idea. You KNOW that I'll skip ANY meal for dessert... so then you sure as hell know that if the dessert counter is what you need to bypass to get to the restaurant, then I'm sure as hell not MAKING it to the restaurant. And to this day, I never have.   When you walk in, the dessert counter is immediately to your left. It's big, it's welcoming and it's gooooood. They sell everything from Jalebis (orange pretzel-looking things, but don't be fooled, they are deep-fried sugar and RIDICULOUSLY sweet!), Gulab Jamuns (Brown, juicy cake), Laddoos (balls of goodness) and a million different types of barfi (Indian/milk-based fudge-like goods).  A couple things I have to warn you though:  #1. If you are planning on going THIS weekend, LOOK OUT. It is Diwali this weekend, which is the Festival Of Lights for Hindus and let me tell you, this celebratory day REVOLVES around these sweets! So it will be packed, it will be chaotic, and it will be INSANE. This only happens once a year, and if you're planning on deflowering your mithai virginity this weekend, then I would say prepare yourself for a rave-like, circus-type, all out gong show. Okay, disclaimer - check.  #2 - If you're planning on going on a regular weekend, ie. any weekend other than this weekend, It's best to go at around 11am. If you go in the afternoon, it is often packed and the line up goes out the door. The service can be VERRRRY slow as there is often only one young woman working the counter (she is very good though!), but prepare to have your patience tested.  #3 - If you've never had mithai (again, Indian sweets) then get an assortment. You can tell the woman at the front 'I want 1 pound, mixed\". Yes, everything is ordered in the pounds... kinda ironic, isn't it? One pound mixed will get you one pound of mixed barfi, and you can specify if you want gulab jamuns (juicy cake) in that mix or not.  Apna Punjab Sweets is my a-list sweet spot. It may not look like all that, but it definitely delivers the goods.  Happy Diwali Y'all!!!"}
{"text":"Its an Indian grocery store which has been poorly setup. looks unorganized, lots of cooked foods like the sweets, chutneys and curries were kept in the open, no proper refrigeration, no health code followed in any way i could see. Owner really needs to rethink of how a grocery store should be kept. Only reason it running is because it's the only one around."}
{"text":"Decent buffet. Goat and butter chicken pretty good. Everything else... just ok."}
{"text":"If you are an Indian veggie food lover then this is the place you shouldn't miss in calgary. This was recently opened with a very low price vegetarian buffet meal ( 7.33 incl. tax ) with no compromise on the items being served. Around 6 varieties of sweets,and 6 varieties of veg-curries with 2 rice items,samosa , roti etc.   I had been to this place twice till now and both the times the food was delicious.It's worth going that far just for food.  But the only problem is, the place is very small and clumsy. So you should be a lucky one if you have a less crowd."}
{"text":"Best Veggie Samosas in town! @ .59cents a peice you cant go wrong. Spiced to perfection and stuffed with goodness 3 of these will fill you up. 5.99 Veggie buffet to boot. Well worth the drive for the samosas"}
{"text":"When in the northeast I usually like to take advantage of all the great Indian places to eat, I usually like to feast at Apna, because not only does it have an affordable lunch buffet at $9.99  that they serve Monday to Friday, there is also an Indian candy take out area attached to it.  The service is fine, there has usually been one girl attending to as many as 8 tables, but being a buffet seems manageable and she basically focuses on refreshing our water glasses and the pans of food in the buffet.    The food here is good, the vegetable and chicken curry, the samosas, the naan, everything tastes pretty good and $9.99 the price is more than reasonable.  The decor is nothing to write home about, standard wooden chairs and tables and tacky 70s decor, but the food makes up for the lack of ambiance for me.  My only dilemma is what to bring home after my meal, all the candies are weighed by the pound and there are so many candies to choose from that I spend almost the same time I did eating as I do deciding.  My favourite hands down is my Gulab Jamuns; I can't leave Apna without a collection of these plus something else.  So if you want a tasty lunch that will fill you, won't deplete your pocketbook plus have the option of tantalising sweets, I suggest you visit Apna."}
{"text":"It's a busy little Indian sweet shop that sells the kind of samosas I'm not really into but the sweets... And in particular the gulab  Jaman... Was really good. I'll be open and honest when I say it was the best I've tasted and... I'm not really a fan of Indian desserts so wasn't going to try anything else... But everything looked fresh.  The Gulab Jaman, though, we're fresh, so soft, perfectly drenched in sweet syrupy goodness. I took some home, put it in a bowl, and in the microwave for 10 seconds. Perfection. Sweet, soft, delicate flavor and texture. A ball of sweet syrupy cake, warm and moist.   Big steel trays of fresh sweets were coming out from the back constantly. It was a line to pay and a line to fill beautiful little boxes with sweet treats. You fill up your little box with whatever sweet treats using tongs... They look so beautiful as the light shines onto their sweet sugary goodness...  Everyone is smiling into the depths of their being because they're about to eat something that will blow their head off with happiness.   The stuff could seriously make me fat. And happy."}
