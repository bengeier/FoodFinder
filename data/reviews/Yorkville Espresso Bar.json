{"text":"This little hidden gem doesn't sound like it'd be hidden, as it is right on Yorkville Avenue, but it's still a gem. It has a cute little interior area with the classic chalkboard menu and a delicious looking pastry section.  I ordered an Americano to-go, and it was brewed perfectly. It's hard to mess up an Americano but you'd be surprised at how many times I've had a disgusting cup. I also love how they stamped their coffee sleeves and kept the simple white cup."}
{"text":"The location is good in Yorkville. The coffee is great and service is excellent. I haven't tried their sandwiches yet. Nice place to meet my friends."}
{"text":"overpriced and not worth it. Was looking for a cozy spot in the area to have a warm lunch and read. The decor was nice and it seemed to have all of the right elements to be great but the $10 veg sandwich was small and subpar and the $5 latte was weak. I don't mind higher prices for an overall nice experience, but if the product itself isn't great then I just end up feeling like a chump for paying for high prices for an address and nothing more. One star for cozy decor and a second for friendly staff, but missing value and quality of food."}
{"text":"What a great cup of coffee!!!  This is a small shop, with friendly staff, modern, relaxed environment and small treats to tide you over.  Try the cortado if you're just looking for a small pick me up!  Such a smooth coffee flavour.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great cappuccinos and friendly service! A must for any avoid coffee person to check out."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely awesome experience at their gluten-free brunch event. The food was spectacular (clean, flavourful, light and rich at the same time, and beautifully presented). The layout of the restaurant is also inspired: each table feels like the chef's table with the chef conscientiously preparing your food on his large quartz island within arm's length. The atmosphere, the ambiance, the food: all inspired. The only complaint: I couldn't finish all the food because there was so much!  Update: really poor customer service and no wifi. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Nice to see Yorkville Espresso Bar finally up on Yelp!  Great spot for an espresso-based beverage, or a yummy pastry.   It's been a pleasure to get to know the staff over my visits, and I highly recommend this to anything else in Yorkville."}
{"text":"I made a planned trip to this area as I needed my caffeine fix. The location is quite good though the the space is limited. Setup is nice and clean though a bit confusing as I thought that there space next to the main area was setup like a cooking class.  I ordered a cappuccino and my friend had a latte. For good measures I got a pistachio biscotti that looked tempting and my friend a vanilla scone (I think) The drink is a small serving  Espresso: light Crema': OK Milk: Frothed OK Latte Art: Decent I found the espresso to be really weak. The Biscotti was nothing special and didn't match the salivating look. I tried the scone and it was rock hard.  I see this spot as a place to lay back if you don't want to stick in the big cafe across the street. 2.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Just stumbled on this place yesterday afternoon when I was in the area. I'd been in line at a 'competitor' coffee place up the street (not to name names, but it started with a 'U') and was underwhelmed by the atmosphere and rude cashier. Before placing my order there I left and came to Yorkville where I encountered Roberto - an extremely kind barista who knew his stuff! Not just the coffee, but the story behind the companies and various baked goods they also carry. Their use of organic and fair trade is wonderful, the cafe is a perfect size space, and though I'm rarely in the area I plan to make this my regular stop when requiring a bit of caffeine intake. Quite a gem of a place, and lucky me for bailing on the other cafe up the street."}
{"text":"The vegan zucchini chocolate muffin is great. Personally an omnivore I fear baked vegan products as they all usually have that foreign vegan 'flare'-lets call it to them. This muffin tasted like it had every animal by-product hidden in it, like it was feeding a vegan a chocolatey pill pocket of eggs and dairy.  Service was nice, hot chocolate was made with all milk and chocolate syrup, opposed to water and sugary chocolate dust"}
{"text":"Yokville Espresso Bar is my new favourite coffee place in the neighbourhood, maybe in all of Toronto, for one simple reason. They use organic milk.  Not as an option which most places in the city don't even offer, but it's just their usual milk and it's not priced much different than any other fancy coffee shop in the area.  I'm not going to talk about the values of \"organic\" because I think it varies but when it comes to milk I do think it tastes better which is the main reason I use organic milk.  The space is small and there are only 2 tables but they have a wide selection of baked goods and sandwiches, many baked from their kitchen/showroom/event space next door.  It's an interesting place and definitely worth a stop if you live or work in the area. Due to the limited seating I probably wouldn't plan a sit down meeting there... or at least have a plan B just in case."}
{"text":"While the coffee and food were good, the service was appalling. When my wife asked if an egg sandwich was vegetarian she got a lecture on how eggs come from animals and would you eat a cows eggs or your own egg? It was ridiculous and unprofessional and really ruined our breakfast. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I only came here because it was \"Macaron Day\" last Thursday.  Purchased 4 for $7 with my colleague.  I thought that was a reasonable price.  I never tried a chocolate mint macaron before and I thought it was pretty good.  However, there was not a huge selection of macarons so I don't consider this a macaron destination place like Nadege or Butter Avenue.  The free macaron was really tiny as well.  Not worth they hype if anyone ever wants to come here for Macaron Day.  As for the coffee, I don't really drink this so I am unable to comment."}
{"text":"I am always looking for REAL coffee shops in Toronto and for some reason this place doesn't appear on any of the top ten lists...well it should! They make fantastic cortados and mochas that are suspiciously cheap, coming in at $3 with almond milk. They take several long minutes to meticulously prepare and come complete with beautiful latte art.  I find the staff to be friendly, unpretentious (this is Yorkville) and funny and the decor is nice with a faux kitchen for decoration. The main thing that stops me from hanging out here more often (with laptop in hand) is that they don't provide free wifi. They are doing themselves a great disservice because of this. And also the bathroom is kind of out of the way and requires getting a key from the counter. On the coffee alone I just love it."}
{"text":"Place is nice, a great place if you are meeting a friend for coffee and gossip. Cappuccino is good, not amazing, not bad, although it is among the higher prices I paid for cappuccino. The people are extremely friendly. Would definitely come back again if I want to spend an afternoon with a friend."}
{"text":"Why bother fighting with foreign students and study groups at Balzac? Just take a two minutes walk and head to Yorkville Espresso.   They have great coffee and awesome baked goods. Selection of tea is limited, but hey, it is a coffee shop after all.   THE BEST PART: You will have a quiet spot to enjoy your coffee and read a book that you just took out from the Reference Library.   Don't forget to grab a key when you want to go to the bathroom, the \"Harry Potter cupboard under the stairs\" type bathroom."}
{"text":"I had a meeting at Yorkville Espresso Bar for the first time. It's a small cafe attached to an adjacent kitchen that doubles as extra seating for patrons. The Kitchen Studio is a cooking school, catering company, and a private/corporate event space. It's also perfect for filming and photo shoots.   When I received my drink, I was surprised for a second because I thought the barista had given me the wrong order. Usually hot chocolate would look like hot chocolate, not like a cup of latte! Luckily though, it was not a mistake and it was delicious. I overall like how quaint the cafe is. I think it's a nice spot in Yorkville and can be overlooked if you aren't seeking it out."}
{"text":"Yorkville Espresso Bar is a bit of an enigma. They are right across the street from Balzac's in the Toronto Reference Library. They have very little room to sit. One  of their bench seats is uncomfortable and awkwardly elevated on one side while the opposing chair is way below eye level.   The next door room has a kitchen which serves as a showroom for a condo and used for holding cooking classes. The bathroom is miniature and located in a maze of offices on the second floor.      Did I mention that they close by 6pm on weekdays?"}
{"text":"So I was literally there yesterday for a caffeine boost before some serious shopping and although I was being picky about my americano, I wasn't made to feel that way and that my friend is great customer service!!   I will be back to try one of their deliciously looking sandwiches!"}
