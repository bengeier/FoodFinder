{"text":"Good selection of food on the buffet - if you go away hungry it's your own fault. Food, service, and atmosphere were wonderful.  Great place for a pre-game meal followed by the best seats in the ballpark!"}
{"text":"Very good selection of food offerings for a family, easy access to seats. Great fan experience!"}
{"text":"First time at the Lexus club. I'm from New York, so my basis of comparison is the Legends club at Yankee stadium.  That said, I give the Lexus club 3 stars. The stadium was nice and the view of the city from the seats was awesome.  Food choices were few compared to the Legends club.  Lexus has a more intimate setting which was nice, but overall, I found the club underwhelming. Great experience and fun night despite its short comings.  View was amazing!! I wish we had the Manhattan skyline from the seats like the Pirates have!!! Lucky Bucs"}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburg for a conference and took in a game while in town.  I've been to several ball parks ... and spent much more on tickets.  The Lexus Club is without doubt the best game experience I've had.  Dinner was included, game snacks were included, seats were amazing and game time service was extraordinary!!!! Highly recommend the club"}
{"text":"Food was great and the selection was endless.  Great atmosphere and the staff was very pleasant. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! The Lexus Club @ PNC Park is unbelievable! Great food, outstanding service &, the best seats to view a game. It's a first rate establishment. Every detail is carefully thought out. The free food & non alcoholic drinks included. The candy & ice cream selections are a treat. Every Pirate fan should experience a game this way."}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to a fantastic park. Go Buccos!  I remember sitting in Three Rivers with my Dad for Clemente's 3000th hit. PNC is the best park in the land. If you can get to the Lexus Club it is the next level of the experience.   Great service. VERY good food. Then all the ballpark food you can eat!  We love Linda if you can get her as a server inside.   AWESOME experience. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It was great to walk in and sit down to eat on real plates.  The food was good and varied, perhaps a bit too varied for my tastes (I'm a simple eater.)  The service was good.  Aside from alcohol it was all \"free\" - but you do pay for it in the price of your ticket.  After dinner and during the game you have full access to a free concession stand with all the peanuts, popcorn and cracker jack you can eat, plus nachos, hot dogs, pretzels, fries, and a wall full of candy."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the pleasure of visiting the Lexus Club on Saturday night.  After visiting Pittsburgh each year for many, many years, to catch a weekend of Bucs baseball, we decided to treat ourselves for one of the games.  Unfortunately the weather was cold, misty, and wet, but fortunately, the atmosphere, service, and food were warm and inviting inside the Lexus Club.  We decided to eat in the lounge, and due to the weather ended up watching some of the game at the bar.  The good was excellent (carved roast beef, pork loin, great salads, etc.), as well as our server.  Shannon did a great job making us feel at home and providing friendly and engaging service.  After we ate we ended up at the bar for a few innings, where we got to meet Larry.  Great bartender who knew how to work the bar and engage his customers.  Sure it is a pricey ticket, but for any true Pirates fan, it is an unforgettable experience.  I highly recommend it, and will certainly return."}
{"text":"This is definitely a great experience. Believe it or not, attending a Pirate game and sitting behind home plate (Lexus Culb ), was an item on my bucket list.  The seats are expensive, but it was worth it.  We attending during an afternoon game.  The buffet had a great variety of food. From homemade waffles to salmon, frittatas, chicken Milanese, salads, fruit and desserts. Everything was delicious. We arrived an hour and half before the start of game, which gave us plenty of time to enjoy our food without being rushed. The wait staff was very attentive and cordial. Then you proceed to your seats and lo and behold there is more food. Hot dogs, popcorn, peanuts, ice cream, pop, water and a wall of candy! You just have to take your seats and enjoy the game. We lucked out, we saw a great game; extra innings with a home run in the 12 th inning!"}
{"text":"Experienced the Lexus Club, great seats for the Bucs game, but unfortunately got rained out. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So....... The seat were great but the food was average.  I paid 240 bucks for the experience and will most likely stick with the baseball club tickets from here on out.  The food there is just as good.  The buffet at the Lexus Club was nice, I am not complaining or being overly critical, it was just not equivalent to the price and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I get to enjoy the Lexus Club one or two times per season.  The quality of the food can be inconsistent but last night everything was very good.  Maryellen, our waitress, was very attentive.  We love the new set up downstairs with the bar, self serve stadium food, candy, and drinks. The seats are comfortable and crowd respectful.  The Lexus Club is a great place to watch the Pirates."}
{"text":"This is an incredible way to watch a baseball game. The staff and service is incredible. The food is okay, no chance you leave hungry."}
{"text":"Well my first time here was way better   The atmosphere is beautiful.  The staff are low brow and aren't service oriented to the crowd they serve.    I hear they are union jobs. No wonder there job Is protected whatever they do   The bar is sad.  Sure they can pour a draft or whip up a rum and coke but they have no clue of a classic margarita   The bar oaf squeezed garnish cut lemon wedges with his bare hands to make my margarita.  He didn't intend on shaking it either.  He made the drink and poured in an short glass of all things   I declined the mess   Buffet isn't worth $55"}
{"text":"The pregame buffet meal was good.  Definitely not 5 star quality, but better food than what you get on the club level here.  As others have written in reviews here, there are temperature issues in the food at the ballpark level along with items running out and not replenished.  I also would have hoped for more drink options in the cooler than coke, diet coke and bottled water.    For a cold afternoon they did have plenty of coffee and hot chocolate to warm is up.   My wife also noticed the restroom here was not as clean and maintained as the club level upstairs."}
{"text":"We were there August 24th and it was my first time there. The buffet was awesome! The pork loin and flank steak were to die for! I also liked the self serve stadium foods and of course the seats are the best in the house. We had a great time"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this isn't Golden Corral (I mean who eats there really?).  The selection is always changing and I don't think I've had a bad meal yet.  Coke float bar tonight was super cool.  The waiter let me take the menu home so I can replicate the cold spring pea and fennel salad - amazing."}
{"text":"Had a great time at the Pirates game in the Lexus Club. The food was delicious and Ali, our server in the seats, was very attentive and helpful. Chris, the usher I'm our section, made us feel like we were long-time friends of his."}
{"text":"The food was not very hot and the desert area was nothing but store bought deserts. I had asked for coffee and was told it would take 20-30 minutes."}
{"text":"Everyone should experience the Lexus club at some point in their life-especially if they like baseball. Yes, I know the tickets are high but they are worth every penny. Part of the ticket includes dinner. They have real China and silverware. At each game they have a different style of food. Tonight we had steak. They have different stations so one had meatballs and pasta, one had different types of salads, one had different sides, one had dips with chips and pitas. Of course the fruit and dessert table is always nice. If that's not enough to fill you up you can have nachos, hotdogs, popcorn, Cracker Jacks, peanuts, a small selection of ice cream, and a wall of different types of candy-Swedish fish, Cowtails, etc. there is also soda and bottled water. The only thing you pay for is beer and/or alcoholic drinks. (Please remember to tip your server).  Now let's talk about the seats. They are big and comfy. They have plenty of leg room. The obvious is that they have an amazing view!!  You feel up close and personal with the game. (Please remember to tip the seat attendee).  I have been in the Lexus club a couple of times. The food and employees are always on point. In fact on this visit my son dressed as a Pirate and they changed our table to the middle of the room so everyone could see him.  So yes, again, the tickets are pricey but when you figure it all in you see that it's worth the price."}
{"text":"I attended a wedding here this weekend, and was really impressed by what a great job they did. The decor was classic, the staff was friendly & available, and the food was surprisingly great."}
