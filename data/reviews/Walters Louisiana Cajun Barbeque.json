{"text":"We had the hot links sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw. The BBQ sauce was similar to Carolina style, thin and vinegary. We loved it. My husband loved it so much that he will take me back to a farmer's market for Walter's food. We are from Georgia and it  tasted like home to us."}
{"text":"FIRST - $14 for small chicken thigh, very small leg, 3 good size hot links, small amount of beans, small amount of cole slaw

SECOND - neither chicken nor links were completely cooked!

I had to microwave at home.

LASTLY - Taste: cheap sauce and way too spicy in a cheap way

Sorry, Walter, you are lucky you are not shut down. This is crap-ola!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Walter since I was 9 years old, don't let these underrated reviews get to you, his food is FANTASTIC. When he gave me his secret sauce (No pun intended), on my chicken it was absolutely astonishing. I had never tasted anything that delicious in my life, and still to this day I crave his secret sauce all over the breasts of my chicken. Might I add-he and his wife are two wonderful people, it's unfortunate that I now live in California, and am unable to go to their Cajun Barbeque-but if you have the luxury of visiting his BBQ spot, please check it out!"}
