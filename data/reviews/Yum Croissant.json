{"text":"This is a new cafe just opened up in the beach area. Their plain, butter croissant is out of this world! It reminds me of a cafe i used to visit while i was in Paris. A crispy, warm croissant with a cup of cappuccino is perfect way to start your day. Small, cozy atmosphere with very friendly customer service. They also have a small, rear patio. I would definitely recommend this place and will come visit again! I have to try their sandwiches. I heard very good things from other reviews and few of my friends who live in the beach area."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean and quaint little eatery in the beach. The diverse menu and types of sandwich croissants is awesome - I wanted to try more than one, but will just have to go back again because the croissant sandwiches I ordered for myself and my two children were absolutely delicious!! The croissants were freshly baked and buttery and just melt in your mouth. The seating area in the back is nice and there's a pretty little patio. Looks like a lot of care went into this place. I'll definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"The croissants are good. Coffee is decent. Seating area the same as when Dufflet was there; clean and comfortable. The smoked salmon sandwich was ok, but expensive for the amount of salmon you get. They use Royal Chinet paper plates for the croissants, but glass coffee cups. We will come back. Good for a lazy Saturday breakfast."}
