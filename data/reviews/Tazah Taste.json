{"text":"Decent food, decent price, great for a late night take out !"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. Bought chai, kashmiri chai, falooda and mangos.   Service was quick. The boys working there was punctual. Didn't waste any time - even though place was full and I took everything 'to go'.   Haven't tried the mangos yet. But will update review once I eat them.   Price: 4 mangos for approx $12 was pricey. But I guess because they come from Pakistan.   Other than that. Not bad.   Check out the pics!"}
{"text":"Good price, tiny place with a small menu but quality rich food for takeout or dine in if you dont mind tiny tables.   ================================PRIYA====="}
{"text":"The food seems authentic, as a lot of Indian / Pakistani customers come in and out. The price is okay."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian and Pakistani food in the down town Mississauga. Very reasonable pricing. Not a place you would take a date to, definitely not. But, when you are lazy to cook, definitely a place to go to.  Ordered a lazy Saturday meal, Chicken Kadahi with Butter Nann and my wife ordered a Chicken Biriyani. Both were awesome and the spices were just right.  The service is ordinary and it can be expected. The Restaurant is what would be considered as a small joint. Very clean though.  The pricing is reasonable, not over priced. Too bad that I have to give it a 3-star because of the Restaurant."}
{"text":"This place needs to redo it's stuff,  it's like they are living in 90s. They need to take care of hygiene and food presentation. With so much competion like Milan etc."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a bad stomach the next day Everything is basically microwaved or heated in the oven Hygiene can be an issue"}
{"text":"The food here is decent but what really stands out is the  Kashmiri Tea . It is amazing. It has a good punch to it that  its  ideal for enjoying on a cold day.  My only issue with the tea is that its excessively sweet. I would   recommend ordering the tea with half a teaspoon of milk and half a teaspoon of sugar. It will allow you to enjoy the tea much better without the overpowering taste of sugar and milk ."}
