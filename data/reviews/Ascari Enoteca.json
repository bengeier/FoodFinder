{"text":"FAIL!

My roomy and I recently dined at Ascari and were sooooo excited to go. What a disappointment.

The food was bland and way to salty to the point where I didn't event eat it. They forgot our appetizers and to top it off, they put onions in my friends dish when we clearly said she was allergic to them. 

I was looking for a great little Italian place on the east side and was hoping this was it, but sadly it is not. If anyone has suggestions please let me know!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighbourhood and Ascari Enoteca was our first dinner here. This meal was amazing, and the service was phenomenal!

We ordered the olives and the Crostini alla Toscana (chicken liver mousse) to start and both were very high quality. For our mains we both had the special, which was tagliatelle with duck, swiss chard, mushrooms, walnut sauce, and breadcrumbs. The duck was perfectly flavoured and succulent, the bread crumbs added a fantastic dimension to the texture. We don't usually both get the same main, but this just sounded so good, and we were certainly happy with our choices!

For dessert we had the banana donuts and the cannoli, and both of them were spectacular! Both the flavour and texture were mindblowing. The restaurant really does a great job of creating dishes with excellent flavour and texture!

We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"My experience at this restaurant marks the first time Yelp has lead me astray. I was so jazzed for what I thought would be an excellent evening, and was very disappointed. The tables in this place are crammed so close together, and the music is so loud I could barely have a conversation with my dinner companion. The charcuterie board was lacklustre, as was the pasta.

The bill was $150 for two...at that price, there are so many other, better options to choose from that I won't be back."}
{"text":"We went here on a recent Monday because they offer wine bottles at half price and we are wine-lovers. We made our reservation in advance but were only told on the day of, that we would have to vacate by a certain time for their second seating. I find that a really annoying policy and one that's becoming more and more popular. Sure you're a business but 2 hours for dinner doesn't make for a very relaxing, enjoyable dinner. 

Their wine list was quite good and we enjoyed that part immensely however the food was spotty. Better for the others at my table (although the friend who'd been their before said the pasta carbonara was much better on their first visit) but for me, who is one of those annoying vegans, it was passable at best. They made me a pasta with zucchini for noodles (which I usually would have loved) but the zucchini was in sticks, not even in thin strips so the spoon they gave me to eat it with was laughable. I had to ask for a knife so I could cut it into bits. Italian food for vegans should not be difficult, especially when I had left a message in advance to let them know. And ok you make your own pasta but maybe carry a few packages of egg-free for cases like these?

Whatever, they probably hated having a vegan dine there but not to worry, I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this when I walked in, it was warm and relaxing on a cold, raining night. My favourite dish was the quail salad and lamb croquette. The quail was perfectly cooked and croquette was flavourful, much more flavourful than the pasta with pork shoulder I had.
It'll be perfect if they have more options on menu as main."}
{"text":"Was very good. Highly recommend the rabbit ragu. Skip the fried broccolini though sounded much better than it tasted. Would go back."}
{"text":"One of the best authentic pasta joints in the city in my view. Even the starters are absolutely delicious. The price point is very reasonable and you can usually get a seat at the bar if you come without a reservation for one or two."}
{"text":"Had the arancini and then the octopus and chorizo risotto.  Both were excellent.  They have a great wine list -- note, it's not what's posted on their website and that's a very good thing.  It's an excellent selection of reasonably priced VQA wines.  Great service and a great experience."}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant focusing on basic ingredients to create authentic Italian food.
Ordered the liver pate and quail as appetizers, which were both great.  Although, I would save some bread for the liver pate, so you can transfer the generous portions of pate from the crostinis to the bread.
When I went, we ordered the specials of the day, which included a tagliatelle with a corn and tarragon butter sauce, which was surprisingly light and delicious.  The other was a tomato based pasta with chorizo, was not as big of a fan of this, however the quality of the noodles was great!
Expensive but delicious, would not go all the time, but on a special occasion or when I am really itching for some homemade noodles."}
{"text":"I was the first customer in the door! 
This is a new venture by the Table17 folks, and has been in the work for a few months now. 
There's no trace of Lou's Variety or Ben's gallery left. It's a cool, contemporary spot with an open kitchen (they make their own pasta) and the colours make me think of mens wear -- those subtle tones, nothing too bright. I don't recall any artwork on the walls: will check next time I go in.

On opening day, they didn't have their liquor license yet -- they were hoping it would come through this week. I'll have to follow up on that.
Failing alcohol, I had a carbonated beverage: they have a few Italian ones, and I chose a Chinotto. It's like having a non-alcoholic bitters. Label looks like '40's pin-up girls. I'm sure a few of my friends would enjoy that. Kinda had a nostalgia thing going on there.

There were a lot of items on the menu I wanted to order. I really had difficulties deciding (and I'll be back to try out other items).

I settled on the Crostini Toscana for an appetizer. Three toasts with a good dollop of chicken liver paté each, with caramelized onions on top, and a fried sage leaf covering all.
Very tasty! I've been making paté for over 30 years, and this one was enjoyable: smooth, sweet, no hint of graininess or bitterness. Not as rich as foie gras, which sometimes is a good thing! The sage leaf had been fried to the point that it shattered perfectly when biting into the toast and had that sort of funky sage flavour, and the onion contributed additional sweetness. Good appetizer. It's going to be a challenge not eating that all the time, now that I know how tasty it is -- saves me making a pound of paté and then eating it all.

I was tempted to order one of the side vegetables -- brussels sprouts -- they sounded delicious. But I worried about eating too much. Then I found a pasta main that included brussels sprouts, so I thought I had it all covered! I had the cavatelli with shredded confit duck, brussels sprouts, and chanterelle mushrooms. The mushrooms were on the verge of crispiness, which was delightful, and helped their meaty taste come out. The brussels sprouts were individual leaves, casually tossed in olive oil, and bright green. They were sweet, and I almost wished they were a little bitter, as a contrast to the richness of the duck, which was gorgeous and moist and everything that good duck confit is. The pasta was firm, provided some resistance when chewing it, and teamed perfectly with the fall food ingredients.

How to finish? I didn't need anything else to eat. I decided to have an espresso, and it came with perfect crema, lovely depth of flavour and richness to complete the meal. 

Yah, it's a good thing I'm fixing up my exercise cycle with a laptop holder, because I'm going to need it with Ascari Enoteca in the Leslieville neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I love the homemade pastas and seriously any Ragu of the day rocks. Must have chicken liver crostini and broccoli fritti. The chocolate chip canoli are the perfect dessert. Great cult wines, prices and super nice wait staff."}
{"text":"Great little Italian place in Leslieville open everyday. Lovely, intimate atmosphere that does get a little loud from all the people talking. Service is friendly and knowledgeable. Monday's is half price bottles. My only criticism is that the food is on the salty side, so it's a good thing Monday is half price bottles."}
{"text":"Quirky little place, great food {fried broccoli is incredible), friendly and efficient staff.  Glad we found this little gem!"}
{"text":"Absolutely top notch service and food! Sat at the bar and the bartender gave us amazing service. We started with the arancini, and the buffalo mozzarella salad which were both delicious. The daily specials didn't disappoint ... We each tried a different pasta dish and were fighting over the last bite!!"}
{"text":"It's not a five star as I made the mistake of ordering steak in an Italian restaurant!  I loved the atmosphere....it was packed on a Monday evening!  Yes it's a bit loud and busy but there's a great vibe. Our server was very polite and helpful even though she was busy.  Love: My friends loved their pasta specials and the lemon pudding dessert was absolute heaven!  Regret: We weren't hungry enough to order appetizers. The chicken liver and arrancini looked amazing.  Also, I ordered the steak special...I know what was I thinking...and it was disappointing. It was supposed to be sou vide but I found it a bit dry and underwhelming.  All in all a great evening with great food and atmosphere. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is now my go to date night spot. Theres not much not to love about this place. a tight, well curated menu, beautiful interior, minimal and a great deep grey. its nice and small, so It feels special.

the best part of it is the special wine flights, giving you the option to do a 2 oz pour or so of some VERY cool wines, that might be a bit out of the price range in a full bottle or glass. 

mostly really well thought out pastas, and delivered with class and elegance.  this place is exactly what a neighbourhood resto should be. cant wait to be back there. in fact, i am making a reso right now."}
{"text":"Always impeccable.  Very straightforward Italian done without fuss but to near perfection.  Nice rotating wine list as well"}
{"text":"Economics of the menu are off for a small, casual neighborhood spot.

Avg. price of an entree is around $15 - $20. No problem.
Cheapest bottle of wine is  $70. No way.

Food is good. Prices of the wine list do not pair well with the menu."}
{"text":"4.5/5!! Absolutely loved the food. All the dishes we ordered were fantastic. The only downside is that the restaurant accepts cash or debit only. For starters, recommend the Arancini Cacio e Pepe and Cavoletti di Bruxelles. As mains, I recommend the Spaghetti alla Carbonara. The ravioli is great as well but I'd personally pick the spaghetti over the ravioli."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this restaurant yet?  I've been a 'regular' (well, as regular as I get) since it opened. 

The pastas are made in-house every day and once you go fresh - you never go back. So good.  I love their carbonara which they decided to keep on the menu last fall (it was a seasonal special in the summer) and I love it when they have a pasta in 'beurre fondu' - because who doesn't love pasta in a butter sauce?  

I come here most often with my husband (who is equally as enthusiastic and he's not enthusiastic about much) but I once organized a large party of 15 women to come on a Monday night (half price wine! woot woot!).  Firstly, arranging our dinner was a great experience because I made a few last minute changes and additions as well as changed our party numbers a few times.  They handled it all with grace and enthusiasm.  And the night we went our service was wonderful.  Anette handled us from my initial inquiry to our last drop of wine.  She's amazing.  I wave to her when I pass the restaurant walking the dogs.  My friends were all so impressed by the amazing courses (ranging from charcuterie to fresh pasta to lemon cakes) that they are now regular customers as well!

I also make it a daily routine when walking the dogs and the baby to check out their specials.  Like some sort of weird compulsion.

I love it here so much that on my first night home from a c-section, my one wish was for a bowl of their pasta carbonara and my husband raced out to get me some!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on New Year's Eve. 
Busy enough but still felt welcome with good service
Ordered the Stracci and will definitely order it again.
The charcuterie plate was very nice but maybe a little small.
No pizza on the menu -- understandable with so many pizza places nearby."}
{"text":"Saturday night dinner here with my wife and another couple (one a foodie of Italian heritage)  was fantastic. We shared the small 'salami' tray, the orenchini, burrata with leeks and pate on crostini which was great fun and a chance to sample all the wonderful appies. This was followed by 4 great mains.I had the beef cheek ragu on a very creamy polenta. It was delicious and particularly satisfying on a cold rainy fall night. We enjoyed our mains while drinking a litre bottle of red wine followed by a couple of delicious light shared desserts. The food satisfied us all and the service was great. We thought the food prices were very reasonable. The waitress was attentive with a good sense of humour. We had an absolutely marvellous time."}
{"text":"No race cars but the homemade pasta is fabulous. had wild boer lasagna and it was superb. good wine selection and great servive"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Italian cuisine this is the place to go. I've been to many Italian restaurants in Toronto but I feel compelled to write this review because their pasta is the best! I've had the Spaghetti alla Carbonara, Stracci con Salsiccia and Spaghetti all'Amatriciana and I have enjoyed all 3 pastas. The Spaghetti all'Amatriciana is my favourite but I would definitely recommend coming back to try them all! Service is always great - staff is friendly. The restaurant does get busy so be prepared to make reservations!"}
{"text":"Just about everything at Ascari is top notch: food freshness & quality, chef/preparation, people, wine list is tremendous and main reason I go back but you just cannot say no to the food, I love it here... well, except the acoustics are awful, and I must always yell at the person right in front of me when the place gets busy. This is very much a Toronto problem so cannot blame just Ascari, but there are solutions out there and owners MUST be aware of this annoying ambiance killer in their establishments.
However, everything else is top notch at Ascari!"}
{"text":"I visited Ascari back when it first opened on a cold January night - it was mostly forgettable - but years later, after browsing photos from a recent trip to Italy, we returned with a healthy craving for homemade pasta. 

The menu has certainly matured from what I remember, and after inadvertently lighting the wine list on fire (they were lovely about the fact that I nearly burned the place down) we got down to business. 

The Burrata was enjoyable, though I found the baby leeks a bit of an odd pairing. Onto pasta, we ordered the Agnolotti and Carbonara - both were a hit - though we did the ol switcharoo halfway through the dish. Can't go wrong with either, it comes down to what you're in the mood for. 

Service was impeccable and the ambiance (albeit a relatively tiny space) was buzzing with lively conversation. Will definitely be back soon, likely to sample an updated Fall menu with some heartier dishes."}
{"text":"The seasonings are way off on their pasta, so I had to add some black pepper and 2 spoonful of parmigiano reggiano(it's not even freshly shaved, they either pre-shaved it or they're just using one of those crappy green cans). It's an italian restaurant, but they don't have any secondo, just appetizers, antipasti and primo. I won't come back."}
{"text":"Was recently here with my husband for a date night.  The ambiance was perfect for a small restaurant.  Not too quiet, although I do wish it felt a little warmer, like it was missing a touch of femininity.  I get it, the restaurant is named after a Formula 1 racing legend so shouldn't be girly lol Wine list was decent, they could have had one or two more inexpensive bottles on the list though.  Food was delicious. We ordered the tuna crostini and lamb stuffed croquette to start.  I found the crostini to be a tad on the oily side but it wasn't off-putting in any way.  Mains were the agnoloti stuffed with braised beef (i think?i can't remember, sorry!) and lasagna.  Both were thoroughly enjoyed but we felt the lasagna was missing tomatoes (tons of meat and cheese though) and the agnolotti could have used a touch more olive oil in the sauce as it was a little dry.  Flavours though were all spot on! For dessert we had the pumpkin zeppoli and chocolate cake.  Both tastey but we agreed the zeppoli were far superior. The menu overall had a very fall/winter feel to it.  Looking forward to when they change over to spring/summer!  The service here is very friendly and laid back.  They were happy to make suggestions whenever asked.  

and hey!!  The give you an opportunity to buy the kitchen staff a beer for $6.  We did and so should you!  We thought it was a great way to thank the staff responsible for your great meal out.

Keep up the good work, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Very good food!! 

They were super sweet and knowledgable of their foods/drinks. My boyfriend and I had a great time! And we cannot wait to return again!"}
{"text":"I took my parents here when they were visiting in Toronto and was not disappointed. I ordered the Stracci con Salsiccia which was the perfect balance of spicy and flavourful, not to mention the fact that the noodles were just the right texture. It's pricey, but the food is worth it. The atmosphere is friendly, it's not too loud inside and out server laughed and joked with us. He was also a good sport when it came to explaining the specials and describing dishes when asked. Next time, I'd like to save room for desert!"}
{"text":"I have been to this gem in Leslieville about 5 times now. For the majority of my visits the restaurants has been packed as it only seats about 50. Food is amazing here! The menu is limited but the pasta is always fresh and the appetizers impressive. The reason I only gave this place 3 stars is because although table service is usually great the last couple times we have sat at the bar we haven't had the greatest experience. Although the bartender is knowledge he is not personable at all. Im not sure if it was just us but we noticed that everyone else was receiving great service from him EXCEPT for us, and this isnt the first time I can say this. You would think every customer should receive the same service regulars and newbies alike. I'll be back and will be sure to make a reservation so I don't have to be serviced by grumpy again."}
{"text":"We're still trying to find some good authentic italian food after a summer trip to Rome and Florence.  Here at Ascari Enoteca, breads are $1.50 per person and had 2 choices plus olive oil for dipping.  Both breads were underwhelming.  For appetizers we tried the charcoal grilled lamb skewers (extremely thin pieces of meat and overly large Maldon salt flakes, I can do much better on my backyard Kamado), the Broccolini Fritti (lightly battered broccolini) was which nice nicely done, and the shaved brussels sprouts which was nothing special.  For mains we had 4 pastas to share: Spaghetti alla Carbonara (very cheesy but redundant and overly similar texture after the 3rd bite), the spicy Stracci con Salsiccia (bits of home made sausage) which was mediocre, a fish and pasta dish (too much lemon and fish pieces were dry) and rabbit with pasta which was probably the best of the 4 we tried.  For dessert we had the Cannoli which was the best dish of the whole meal, and the Zeppoli (donut balls in chocolate sauce) which the kids enjoyed.  Service was excellent and attentive.  Overall a dissapointing meal food wise and no where near the authentic italians dishes that we are still seeking in the GTA."}
{"text":"I understand that each and every business has its good and bad nights, however this night left something to be desired. Very much so.

I'd like to start by saying our waitress (or server if you like) was especially friendly and did try to make sure everyone was pleased. Certainly top marks for her. 

The food.... well I will never go back based on the poor showing it made.
Not only did it come a full hour after we ordered, but it was some of the cheapest food I have ever been served. 
The pasta was as if it had come directly from a Ramen package (this is not an overstatement), had some lemon butter thrown in, and a meagre slice of Speck (ham) throw atop. This is $19? Honestly my wife and I were shocked that something so incredibly poor could have taken an hour to deliver. The lovely server was apologetic, mentioning that the kitchen was very busy that night. I would have bought that if it were not for the conversations I saw the staff having. Not rushing shall we say....

So, overall, maybe this will review will be seen by the owners, and patrons in the future will have a better experience. It certainly seems that others in the past have enjoyed the food a great deal, so let's hope my experience wasn't the norm."}
{"text":"There's something to be said for great Italian food. You know - food that's delicious using simple and fresh ingredients. That's the basis of Italian food (btw I'm pretty sure I was Italian in another life!)

Context: I've been to Italy. Several times. Tuscany has my heart. So I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food. I'm not easily impressed.

Ascari Enoteca is a great place in the East End - I'm lucky enough that it's in my neighbourhood (though it's slightly dangerously too being in such close proximity - ha!)

I've been here twice (so far). And both times I've thoroughly enjoyed the food. And the atmosphere. It's a small, charming local joint. I love that. Completely different vibe from a Terroni, for instance.

Now onto the food! My absolute favourite bite of food here: The Chicken Liver Mousse appetizer (aka Crostini alla Toscana). Simply bellissima. I LOVE chicken liver mousse/pâté, and the family recipe at Ascari completely delivers on the flavour. It is truly sublime. (Btw I recently took a friend there who said she wasn't a big chicken liver person and she love it!) It's completely decadent (yet light) and is somewhat reminiscent of a foie gras-ish texture/feeling/taste. Very different from the more rustic/country version found in Tuscany - but amazing!! Don't miss out on this one - trust me.

As for pasta, I've tried their infamous Carbonara (they claim to serve one of the best ones in the city). I agree with that claim. Definitely one of the top in the city (that I've had). Now some notes: It's not a classic carbonara - they do take some liberties. For instance, the pasta they use (though made fresh daily, I believe - and very light & yummy) is more similar to a noodle than a spaghetti. As well, they add peas - not traditional, but I loved the element of brightness it brings to the dish. Complements the fatness from the super crispy pieces of guanciale, egg yolk, and cheese. A standout dish for me.

The other pasta I had was a special they had - which included sautéed chicken livers. So decadent and delish as well! 

I haven't had anything else on the menu yet - but I'll be back to try more stuff :)

Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"I suspect I'll get into trouble with the locals but I can't help myself.  I have to gush a little bit about Ascari.  

Went with a large group and they accommodated us without any difficulty.  That said, the restaurant was FULL.  You definitely want to get a reservation if you're bringing a posse. 

This was an all around excellent dining experience - from the service to the wine to appis to the mains to the...well, ok, the coffee for dessert was probably my least favorite part of the meal but everything else was absolute perfection."}
{"text":"It's expensive enough that we only eat here on special occasions, like my wife passing a big exam with flying colors at graduate school.
The wait-staff are friendly, smart and casual. The decor is laid back, the music a tad too loud. But it's still comfy.
The food is excellent. Dishes are quite original, even though most are based on pasta. There are many ways to verify the authentic Italian approach to cooking; one is that red meat is not central to any dish. Healthy fats -- the olive oil served with bread is a knock-out -- prevail, as do veggies.  
The place is a real tribute to local and sustainable, though they make no fuss about that. The owners are supporters of Local Food Plus and it shows in wine choices that are organic and local, as well as many ingredients. 
The pasta is made in the kitchen by two pasta makers who come in four days a week -- talk about the local job creation that comes from local, sustainable unprocessed food!! In my book Food for City Building, I rant at length about how Toronto's restaurants could become major scenes of artisanal job creation, so there's no reason to rant anymore here.
Lots to enjoy and feel good about at Ascari"}

{"text":"So so pleased with this little joint.

Reservations highly recommended as seats are limited but we managed to walk in on a Friday night and grab two seats at the bar. The bartender was super nice, knowledgeable, and helpful in recommending not only what was good, but what was a MUST for our first visit (pasta!). 

BURRATA to start was served w braised leeks, pistachios, honey, olive oil croutons, microgreens, and the lightest drizzle of truffle oil. Perfection in the balance of flavours and textures. CARBONARA was flippin delish and what was nice was the pancetta was crisped but rendered soft enough to easily chew. Roasted butternut squash to provide just a hint of sweetness. Special of the day was a SOREL MUSHROOM thin pasta -- a bit heavy on the butter but still pretty tasty with tarragon. To drink, the grapefruit cocktail was indeed easily crushable."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it.  Again.

Fresh made pasta, not the dried stuff.  Pure ingredients, it's what real Italian food tastes like.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Came back here this past wknd as I had a craving for their lamb tagliatelle... Made reservations for a table  but decided to sit at the bar instead. The restaurant is small and cramped and service was beyond spotty this time - I'd say the bartender is borderline rude.  

My bf and I shared the broccolini appetizer - delicious but they went a bit heavy handed on the salt. I got the lamb tagliatelle but this time,  the pasta was a bit too al dente for my liking,  plus the sauce was a bit too sweet rather than savoury.  I wasn't a fan.  My bf had the spaghetti carbonate which was quite good - the pasta was cooked quite nicely and the flavour was excellent. 

Overall,  the food was OK but inconsistent,  the atmosphere is cute but a bit small and cramped and I was put off by the service at this place,  not sure if I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner. Didn't make a reservation but they were able to fit us in at the bar. It's a small place but gets packed on a Saturday night. The appetizers and main were delicious, and the bartender (who I assume is the owner), knows his food and wine."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place in the east end to enjoy some really good pasta. I heard Ascari was the place to go.....I was wrong.

I don't even remember what I ordered, it was so unforgettable. 

Looks like it's back to the west end - Campagnolo is waiting for me (still the best pasta in Toronto)"}
{"text":"The food and service are very good ....however; when busy, as it was yesterday evening at 9pm, the noise in the room is deafening ......not the place for a romantic dinner for two ....or a get-together with friends.

And, while the wines are interesting, they are very expensive with no 'good value' options.

The food is good, the staff friendly and hard-working ...... but really the resto is too noisy and too expensive for what it is ....a trattoria"}
{"text":"Good food, good wine.  Nice bar area.  Pastas are simple but well executed.  Have been a couple of times and will go again.  One tip is if you call and they say they don't have a table yet you just go you will probably be seated.  I've done this twice now."}
{"text":"Took my parents for dinner here when they were in town. I was a bit worried about the negative reviews regarding service, so was happy when we received attentive, friendly service. Pastas were excellent, different from what you typically see from other restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Cool little place on queen east.  The food was very nice, great fresh ingredients, interesting and original wine selection, we would go back!

Only thing lacking was the service, we had to ASK to order and a lot of other people were sitting around too, the wait staff seemed a bit dosey.  This place is very small so there's no reason people should be waiting to order or pay their bill."}
{"text":"What an excellent evening of food, drinks and ambiance.  The service was spectacular from the second we walked in.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and even took the time to ask what we were doing for the weekend as we paid our bill. 

We started out with cocktails, which were delicious.  For starters we had the caponata (sweet & sour stewed eggplant with tomato) and the special starter: zucchini stuffed with ricotta, deep fried in a crisp, light batter.  Both appetizers were wonderful, particularly the zucchini.

For our mains we obviously went with pasta.  My friend had a dish with spicy sausage.  I had a dish with zucchini and ground pork shoulder in a very light cream sauce.  Again, both were perfection.

The ambiance was nice - the interior modern but warm and definitely a friendly, welcoming environment.  Love the vintage racing posters and thematic nature of the entire restaurant.

Wonderful food!  Great Drinks!  I will be back - hopefully sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here with my husband and also with my cousin. 
A great place for both occasions! Its a cozy restaurant with really yummy entrees and desserts. They also have a good drink selection. 

Would recommend for date night"}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious and made with care, and our server, Drew, helped make the experience wonderful.  He was very friendly, knowledgable and on-point.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As usual in the East End, restaurants do not disappoint!  This may be one of my most favourite hoods to eat in!  Go Leslieville!

This place delivered a nice ambiance with delightful food with delectable flavors.

For appies, we had the ANTIPASTO CICCIO, a perfect blend for charcuterie, it had great flavors of meat, cheese and roasted beets.

For pasta, I had the TAGLIATELLE, which was homemade.  You can definitely taste the homemade consistency which was light and buttery.  You can taste the truffles, mushrooms and thyme - what a delightful mix.

Overall, the restaurant was good, it is more pricey for what you get, but the taste is definitely worth the splurge for the experience!  I was a happy camper after my meal here."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Italian food in Leslieville as well as excellent service!...
Make sure to make reservations..."}
{"text":"Great food, and speedy service. The pasta is definitely fresh and flavourful.  The desserts are equally as good. We ended up going for an early dinner, and had brought our little one with us. It's definitely not a family restaurant in the evening, but if you go early enough you can make it work."}
{"text":"So there isn't more than a handful of hand made, top quality pasta restaurants in the city. This place does it VERY well. It's also small and intimate and the service is great. Sit at the bar for a great experience and a Somalier that will guide you through some nice by-the-glass choices"}
{"text":"Imagine being a sit down restaurant in 2018 and not accepting credit cards. Making a shitty experience for your customers just to save 2.9%. 

I guess it makes it for a good money laundering business. 

On the food, was pretty disappointed. The calamari pasta had no flavors going together. The carbonara barely had any flavor and tasted pretty basic. I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"Named after legendary race car driver, Alberto Ascari, this Italian eatery delivers excellent fresh made pasta dishes in a contemporary and casual environment.  The place was busy and happily boisterous which made conversation sometimes difficult but does not detract from the real focus which is outstanding food.

Ascari does well with offering a simple menu mostly of pasta but elevating each dish to simple perfection.  All too often, trendier places fall victim to too much experimentation and over-complicating food.  Ascari does not.  This place gives you excellent quality with pure and vibrant flavours.  

Deep fried broccolini was on par with the best tempura you would have had.  Lightly battered and dusted with salty parmesan, each morsel maintains the crisp crunchiness of well cooked greens.  A touch salty for some of dinner friends but perhaps it was just the pieces that they happen to grab.  

Other apps were equally well prepared, a quennelle of chicken liver pate, salumi, a bite of cured sardines.  Yummo!

All of our pasta dishes were super delicious.  They do stretch on the higher side of the price scale for pasta dishes but its worth every extra loonie.  
Papperdale with mushrooms and truffle, stracci with braised lamb, chard and black currants was a savoury delight as was the other pasta dish whose name i've forgotten but it came with a spicy pork sausage.  Porky goodness! 

Ascari Enoteca is an excellent place. Casual and well priced, Ascari has the benefit of doing a few things very well rather than try too hard.  The wine list is good with many reasonable priced bottles on offer."}
{"text":"An excellent choice for a dinner date, my friend and I booked in a spot here on Friday night.  Braving the impending rain, we were tucked into a small table near the window and sat down to enjoy what would be a lovely evening.  Ascari Enoteca is a cute little place, soft, and warm, with a minimal decor and amazing food.  Pasta is made in house daily, and the menu rotates to keep it fresh.  And real.  
  Having visited only once previous to this, I was very much looking forward to sampling the menu wares.  My prior visit was a stop in for a drink.  We ordered up a round of Amaretto Sours, and watched with amazement as the bartender poured all kinds of potions into the shaker and produced the best Amaretto Sour I've had to date.  My sister nearly toppled off her chair with amazement.  Now, the food that the friend and I had this past visit was the equivalent of the seat topple.  Yes, that good.
  I ordered the linguine with sausage and clams, dusted in an anchovy bread crumb. She enjoyed a dish with a truffle puree and hen of the woods mushrooms.  Each dish arrived, well presented, easy on the eyes, nose, and of course, the palatte.  The truffles in the one dish paired up nicely with the earthy meatiness of the mushrooms and left me wishing I had room for more.  My own dish was just delightful as well.  The sweet of the sausage against the brine of the clam was a welcome contrast, with the breadcrumbs offering a nice texture to hold up to the softness of the two.
  Having said all of this, for some reason, I feel that this place has the potential to be something greater, based on the menu alone.  I can't say exactly what it was that I felt lacking, small details, perhaps, but I hope in the future, my next visit will be of the five star variety."}
{"text":"We ordered the salumi (3 selections) for $11 ... several tasty cured meats served with whole grain mustard and some pickled vegetables (celery, cauliflower, onion, etc.). It came just after we were served bread and oil, and made a lovely appetizer. Enjoyed this one. I really liked the pickled celery. 

I just felt the carbonara was off. It was too greasy -- a carbonara should be rich, of course, with the egg, cheese, and guanciale, but it seemed there was too much grease. The squash cubes were tasty on their own, but seemed too heavy in addition to what is already a heavy dish. Maybe others find it more appealing, but I felt that Ascari's rendition had too many things going on. The dish was unusually dark, and just fatty. I found it hard to finish.  

Their menu changes, so what we saw on the menu is not the same as on their website. My boyfriend mentioned that he enjoyed his pasta, but also found it a bit busy. It had ground pork and broccolini (?). 

The service was fine -- good. The server was kind and attentive -- whisked our dishes away when needed, and kept our water glasses full -- something even nicer restaurants frequently don't manage. We went on a Monday night, so perhaps it made the room more manageable. Still, we appreciated it. 

I didn't get to see the bill this time, but the prices are probably a few dollars high considering the main pasta dishes, although I'm not sure I really even liked the dishes, so prices are a bit immaterial. 

The wines could have been more reasonable, but I've sort of resigned myself to the fact that prices are going higher rather than lower in most places in Toronto.

I think if the pasta dishes were more straightforward and lighter on the fatty taste, I'd come back to try it again."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and LOVED it both times!  

Come for the fresh pasta, but add on some appies and wine.  Yes, it's pricey, but it's oh-so-worth-it.  We've tried the Stracci and the Cavatelli.  Both were pitch-perfect!  The Stracci has a healthy amount of wonderfully non-gamey lamb with swiss chard, currents, pine nuts and other tasty ingredients.  The truffle-scented cavatelli is hard to go wrong in my books in that it has many of my favourite things: not raindrops or roses, but duck confit, brussel sprouts, and chanterelles.  

Off the starter menu, we've had the crostini and caponata.  Of the two, I like the crostini, but both were excellent!   The crostini is a great blend of smooth and crunch between the well-seasoned chicken liver mousse and the perfectly toasted crostini. 

Wines were generally tasty and I love that they let me sample before committing.  

The vibe is great too.  Small room with a large bar and you can kinda see into the kitchen.  

They're doing DJed events on Monday.  If I remember, I'll go on Monday and report back!"}
{"text":"It's been less than a week since my dinner at Ascari Enoteca, and I'm already planning my next meal there. Vivek S. has already nailed it on the head -- the pasta is absolutely flawless, and definitely the star of the show. My Stracci pasta was to die for: wide sheets of fresh pasta with sumptuous chunks of braised lamb, a smattering of pignoli, and bits of chard. I could have eaten four bowls of this. My dining companions were kind enough to let me have a taste of their pastas, and I'd say it was a pretty close race for 1st place between all of our dishes. Eeetza good pasta. *makes Italian-esque kissing noise* Squisito!

The Antipasto Ciccio was delicious as well -- a huge board with several kinds of salumi, cheeses, and antipasti. I particularly enjoyed the pickled vegetables and the bresaola. The appetizer was huge, and definitely feeds two starving people or four for nibbles. 

The wine list is quite large for such a small, casual place. I also loved the wine descriptions on the menu -- playful but still meaningful enough to make a good decision.  

I'd also like to award Ascari some extra-credit points for two more things: 
1. Not restricting menu access on their website to a PDF download. I *hate* it when restaurants make me download a PDF to view the menu. So, yay Ascari for doing it right!
2. Online reservations! No need to call the restaurant beforehand! 

In short, I loved my meal at Ascari. I'm definitely headed back ASAP so I can shove my face in another bowl of their awesome pasta."}
{"text":"Similar to Pat A. who was the first customer at Ascari, we ordered the Crostini Toscana to start.  It was quite delicious and our dog tried to lick our face off when we got home so human and dogs approve :) 

The menu is predominately pasta, salads and appetizers aside, so this I found a bit disappointing. With little variety of options I was left wondering how this place would have me coming back consistently. 

Regardless, having difficulty choosing from the lack of choice I defaulted to the waitress, which we all know can be a challenge sometimes. You hope to hear some romanticized answer and often get the \"Well I haven't had a lot of this stuff because I don't eat meat.\" This waitress on the other hand was amazing. With a hint of an Italian accent and ability to tell a story, she had me sold on the lamb pasta. Now I'm not going to do it any justice by explaining it, so you'll have to try it yourself but essentially it was braised lamb, with square homemade pasta, what seemed to be dried cherries and a very subtle use of cheese. Spectacular!

The significant other settled for a simple spaghetti but as far as simple spaghetti's go ... again the actual noodles were incredible and the tomatoe sauce was deliciozo!

We ended the night very unnecessarily with the equivalent of what I'd say are fried banana donuts. Banana's battered, fried, dipped in sugar and cinnamon and then served with a creme of caramel. 

We also had an espresso and Americano and I'd go back just for the coffee it was so good.

The meal was served with perfect olive oil and bread, which they are apparently still trying to settle on ... the bread not the oil.

They still didn't have their license so it ran us $70 before tip and tax.

In terms of decor ... it's lacking the warmth of an Italian establishment. I'm all for minimalist and slightly industrial looking design but it's too \"cold\". What's really great is the postcard that comes with your bill that tells the story of Alberto \"Ciccio\" Ascari, why they haven't leveraged this story to add some life to the walls via black and white photography is odd.

However, given it's Table 17 affiliation, I am confident they'll make the place work but would def recommend more variety on the menu or at minimum a changing menu.

Otherwise it was yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent apps, terrific pasta. Three of us ate and drank (a bit) for $95. A very good price for a very tasty meal."}
{"text":"Went here for a late reservation on a Friday night and could not have been more happy with the food or service. It's all Italian, pastas, cocktails, wines, you got it. 

The restaurant was busy and had a fantastic feel to it. The wait staff were fantastic and even though we had one waitress assigned to our table there was never an issue with ordering another glass of wine etc. from a different server, they were all very friendly and accomodating. We split an appitizer and each got a bowl of pasta. Both were fantastic, they had a summer special pasta that was fresh and the perfect sized portion. Not too big...no food coma. 

Excellent wine selection, a little expensive but delish. The food was very reasonably priced. Will deffo be back."}
{"text":"Went here for Mothers Day - it was pretty busy I recommend reservations unless you are a party of 2.
Between 5 people we ordered:
Apps:
fried broccoli (daily special) - pretty good, light on the breading (a positive)
Tuscan beans - didn't try
arugula salad - surprisingly flavourful and the mushrooms tasted bright and tangy
Entrees:
Jerusalem Artichoke pasta (big, flat noodles cooked perfectly with rich sauce)
Sausage/Pepper pasta - lots of veggies, wished there was more meat but still good
Ricotta Stuffed Gnocchi - OMG probably the best bite of pasta I have ever taken, I could have eaten 3 bowls of this. I have been talking about it for days.
I am only sorry I didn't have room for what can only be described as deep fried bananas dipped in caramel. Yum.

Everyone was happy and full leaving the restaurant. Atmosphere is clean and simple but also warm. I would try anything on the menu as none of the dishes we ordered disappointed. Service is fine, they definitely know their Italian and their dishes. Will absolutely return and recommend highly. 

As of May 13, they were accepting cash & debit only."}
{"text":"Named after a legendary Italian racecar driver, Ascari Enoteca is run by the same folks behind other Queen East haunts like (now defunct) Table 17 and the Hi-Lo Bar, and promises the same kind of warm and relaxed hospitality here as those other places. Dunno what the hell that is supposed to mean, but if it's warm hospitality you're driving here for, they quite delivered it. The warm chatty bartender who's happy to answer questions about the food and whatnot, sure; great service indeed. For an intimate upscale casually-spirited Italian dinner house though the music's kinda racing loud--maybe they were more aiming for totally social over a few wines ambiance. La dolce vita, eh?

The human gasoline at this corner fuel station are friggin awesome, even if the menu is small and it drives you way up the budget, which it sure will; I'll balk at that. That being said, the pastas all taste very fresh, because I'm told a minion in the kitchen is tasked solely to produce the noodles in house daily. My Tagliarini al Limone ($18) was delicious with ricotta shavings and shallots complementing elegantly with the pasta. You can also fuel up with their daily special, as well as a small selection of appetizers like a cured meat board to share.

It's an enjoyable dinner place like so many others on Queen East for the one time you decide to check it out. It is smaller than it looks, seating maybe a good 40 at best, so better best shift gears quickly for a reservation.

{TTC: any Queen streetcar to Brooklyn/Caroline Avenues.}"}
{"text":"One of the most disappointing dining experiences we've had in a long time.  

When the call came in from Ascari confirming our reservation and they pointed out they don't take credit cards (cash & debit only) we should have cancelled right then and there.  This is a big pet peeve of mine.  It's 2016 even I take more payment options then this business does.  

We arrived and the place was loud.  It's fairly small (15 tables) and they had a group of 12 booked.  We could barley hear each other or the waitress. Not much they really could do about that but it really set the tone for the evening.  Especially with them popping in and out for a smoke leaving the door open so the stank of their cigarettes can flow in.  

Service was the worst we experienced in our 4 years together. Did I mention this was our anniversary?  All we could do is laugh.  There was only two waitresses working and one was dedicated to the party of 12 and hostess duties.  Ours I think was stoned tbh.  We asked for more water and she'd come by and fill the gasses on our neighbouring table and then walk away. We'd as a second time and it would take another 10 min.  Getting a drink was equally as frustrating.  I finally gave up and we even tried to give a subtle hint asking if it was always so busy.  

Food was for the most part very good.  The grilled lamb skewers were tasty but they were a little heavy handed with the maldon salt  Broccolini fritti were crispy and not at all greasy.  Agnolotti di Bufala was the perfect summer pasta dish,  Light tasty and bright.  My Spaghetti alla Carbonara however was like eating ramen noodles with Elmers glue paste."}
{"text":"My hubby and I tried out this place when we had a child-free night. We didn't have a reservation, but the hostess was able to seat us at the bar. The bartender was incredibly congenial, knowledgeable and attentive. The menu included fresh pasta dishes, vegetables with a twist, and local brews. It was so good we came back a few weeks later (made a reservation this time) when we had another date night opportunity. The server was also awesome and the food was fresh and delicious. This is my new favourite restaurant!"}
{"text":"This gem is tucked away in east Leslieville and it's worth traveling out to it. Had the beef cheek ravioli that was to die for.

Small place, quaint and great for date night with your partner.

Love it"}
{"text":"Like many others I salute their quality.  Everything tastes fresh and well made.  I wasn't a huge fan of the small olives but good quality.  Chicken pate was a bit strong tasting for me but good portion size.

Risotto balls were very tasty.  Excellent choice.  

Decent selection of wines and service prompt, attentive and helpful.  
Pasta of the day was good - freshly made pasta is always nice and house made sausage tasty.

Obviously skilled chef - I think he could add to menu a little bit as choice s felt a little limited  but given place was full I am guessing it works just fine as it is for them!"}
{"text":"First off.  I quite like this restaurant.   It's quaint enough to be intimate, but lively enough to be social.    There's a great wine list, an upbeat attitude to the environment and everyone's friendly and fun.  

Unfortunately, it's a little too hit-and-miss for a place at this price level.  

Sometimes you get delicious delicacies.   Sometimes you're amazed at how bad it is.  

And you really have no way of knowing which way it's going to turn out.   

I like the cute idea that you can buy the chefs a round of beer for $6.    Unfortunately, I guess everyone bought the kitchen drinks all at once last night because the chefs  decided to prepare what seemed to be Mister Noodles packets while they drank. 

It's lacking in consistency in a way that's unsettling.   Which is a shame.  

Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

Had a wonderful dinner here and definitely want to come back soon! There are so many rustic little Italian restos, but Ascari Enoteca stands out for amazing quality, service, and ambiance. 

The menu is not huge, but there are lots of interesting pasta combinations and a bunch of side dishes which are great for sharing. We got the brussel sprouts, which were actually shredded so it looks almost like cabbage. I've never had brussel sprouts served that way and they were delicious! For my main, I had the cavatelli pasta with veggies and cheese (forget what kind). The portion was just right and the homemade pasta was perfectly al dente. Nice cocktail list too! Didn't have room for dessert. 

If you like Italian, definitely try this place out for a laid-back meal!"}
{"text":"First time visit. Love the decoration style of this store. We didn't make reservation in advance so only the bar seats left for us. Food was good but a little bit salty for me. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and it definitely delivered. The pasta dishes are delicious and are definitely the standout things we had, which is good because it was the main reason we came!

We started with some bread and the Burrata to share which was a great sharing option. The bites with the guanciale were my favourite part.

I had the Spaghetti alla Carbonara which came with peas instead of roasted squash that night. My wife had the Tagliatelle con 'Nduja. Both dishes had quite different flavours, so it was enjoyable to share them with her and mix it up. Both were incredibly delicious though if you like spicy you might prefer the Tagliatelle con 'Nduja.

Both desserts we had were great. I had the Chocolate Walnut Cake with rum sabayon, cranberry powder and maldon salt. Love the bites of the cake with the sabayon and the salt! My wife had the Cannoli which she liked because it wasn't too sweet on the inside.

I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I dinned here on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was packed.  It's a small restaurant I'd say 40 people occupancy and that is with tables spaced very close together and bar seating.  It's very quaint.

I examined the menu not an abundant number of options and the mains were all pasta dishes.  I would have liked to have a couple non pasta dishes.  For an appetizer my friend and I shared the arancini.  The arancini was on a mushroom sauce, superb.  For an entree I ordered the special Octopus Risotto.  The Octopus was perfect and delicious, the risotto also good.  We finished our meal with dessert. Only three options again very limited.  Options included deulce de leche, lemon semifreddo and banana fritters.  I got the deulce de leche cannoli and my friend the lemon semifreddo.  Both were delicious, although expensive at $8 each and both were small portions. 

I wasn't wowed by Ascari but I enjoyed it.  A little crowded and they could use more options on there menu, entrée and especially desserts. They are pricing things on high end, which could be acceptable if portions were larger."}
{"text":"Didn't have resos on a friday night, so we just got seats at the bar. Same menu, but just higher seating. The overall vibe of the place is very cozy. Everyone in the room seemed to be having a great time. 

The barkeeper/waiter was very nice and explained how the menu works and what they're known for. They kept emphasizing that their pasta is house made. But when you pay $20+ for a plate of pasta, I would really expect that its not Unico pasta from a bag. Pastas were good, but nothing special to be honest. 

The chicken liver crostini is by far the best thing on the menu, and really bumped it up to 4 stars fro me. Otherwise, this would be a 3."}
{"text":"200th Review! 
I've heard the raves about this place so it was the perfect place on a Saturday night when an old friend was in town. I called and the hostess squeezed us in at the bar.  For me it's more 3.5 than 4 but this is the first time. I'll have to go back! 

VIBE 
It's very simple but it works. Charcoal grey walls with nothing else on them and a few pictures on the other side of racecars (the reviews below explain why). 
The bar is fantastic. Beautiful, gorgeous marble and you can't peek down to see the magic of what the bartender does. :) 
Crowd is sophisticated and relaxed. Lots of couples or four-tops of friends. It's a nice vibe. You don't feel rushed here. 
Service is friendly but not warm, if that makes sense.  However, he was very informative on the drinks and food. That said, I was here to catch up with my friend not make friends with the bartender. 

WE ATE
We started off with the olives and bread --it would have been nice to get a basket, instead of one piece of bread at a time but that was probably a good thing since we'd be loading up on our carbs that night. 
We wanted something more heavy so we got the Crostini alla Toscana: three crostinis topped with a generous dollop of chicken liver mousse, capers and sage. Wow. If you want an explosion of flavour, this is where you'll get it. Definitely good value. We were happy after this course. 

We were craving pasta and pasta we ate! I got the fetuccine bolognese, which was the special of the night. It was a generous portion that made you feel satiated. There aren't many meat with pasta options on the menu so this is why I got it. But this bolognese didn't have red sauce and I was disappointed by that fact. Pasta was as fresh as can be. 

I nibbled on my friend's choice: the Tagliatelle with Jerusalem artchoke sauce (whatever that means); mushrooms, black truffle puree and fresh thyme. All I have to say is I wish I got his dish! Wow. The flavours were amazing and the thick noodle picked it all up. Damn. 

WINE: 
I got a glass of 2008 Nero di Troia / Colle Petrito  --it was a full bodied red that went well with the bolognese. I was definitely a bit tipsy after this one. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Definitely one to \"race\" to in Leslieville. It's a nice space and I hope it continues to do well but I would love to see a chicken pasta dish on the menu. I'll definitely be back if not for the Tagliatelle, for the Cavatelli. Great date place!"}
{"text":"The food is always pretty good here. We have been a bunch of times because we lived pretty close to the restaurant. We were there a few weeks ago and I had some tartare for an appetizer and the mushroom pasta for dinner. It was perfectly cooked pasta and the flavours were great. Everyone else seemed pretty pleased with their food as well. The service can be a bit spotty which is why I am giving it a 3 but the food is always great."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with two friends - this place gets so busy so make sure you make a reservation. Luckily we were able to get seats at the bar. 

The entire experience was absolutely lovely, I don't know how else to describe it. We had the Crostini alla Toscana and the Arancini to start. The former is chef's mother's recipe, melts in your mouth with lingering flavours and paired wonderfully with the Nebbiolo that I got. Absolutely heavenly. And the latter - well, all of us were \"oh my god. oh my god.\"-ing after the first bite. All the pasta is freshly made in-house - I sadly do not remember what the name of what I had was, but it had rabbit and lavender jus in it. Flavourful and harmonious. 

Intimate atmosphere. I would come back in a heartbeat. This would be a great spot for a date or small group (four people or less). Do keep in mind that they do not take credit, only debit or cash."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and I love it every time. Delicious wine that's different from what I'm used to. The Georgian red was delicious. They are proud of their unconventional wine list. 

The warm olives are amazing. There's the regular ones on the menu, which are great, but if you're lucky there might be a special warm olive dish. They had crushed big green olives with herbs and lemon. Amazing. I've never had olives so good. 

The pasta was pretty good too. The duck confit on the tagliatelle was a bit salty but other than that the dish was delicious. 

Not a cheap night out that's for sure but not outrageous either. 

I would definitely recommend checking this place out. 

The service has always been friendly and efficient. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, good service, and tasty Italian food. I had the Spaghetti alla Carbonara, which was very flavourful and satisfying, even though the portion size is modest. Noodles were fresh and perfectly al dente - but resembling a delicious ramen noodle more than spaghetti somehow. For dessert I had some kind of lemon soufflé and an espresso, both of which were lovely. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Delightful neighbourhood go to.   It's hard to get a table without a reservation, but you can usually grab a seat at the bar.    Monday nights all the wines by the bottle are half price, and it's a pretty good list.   I always have the broccolini fritti - it is irresistible.   Short list of pastas - made in house, simple and delicious."}
{"text":"This is a 2.5 stars, which is unfortunate given the tasty pasta.

Here's what you need to know:

Simple ingredients put together in a delicious concoction. The duck tagliatelle was simple but tasty as was the canoli dessert.

Prices are way off - $23 for a pasta that's an average portion size.  Prices for the wines are idiotic given it's a small neighbourhood joint (if Skin+Bones is open head there. It was unfortunately closed due to some private event)

Service was terrible at the dinner table, as though the waitress couldn't give a damn. Didn't tell us about the specials, was generally rude and unhelpful. When I asked for advice on wines, she literally shrugged and said \"that's a Chardonnay, that's a Sauvignon Blanc and that's how they taste\". Really? I asked for a dry and she shrugged and looked uninterested again. Not what I expect when I pay $13 for a very average glass of 5 oz wine.

Service at the bar was better by the time our friends joined us, and the bartender told us about the specials, gave good advice on the menu etc. However, the bar stools were so uncomfortable we didn't want to sit long.

Ambience is meh - nothing to think about. The service and ambience make the prices really stupid. We paid over $85 a person for 1 pasta each, a couple of glasses wine, and one dessert that was shared. NOT WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Nice warm, cozy atmosphere, a bit noisy once it got busier. Packed on a Monday night (half price bottles of wine!). Friendly and attentive service. My main was good (the ravioli), but the small plates were the most tasty part of our meal. We had the broccolini (highly recommended), the brussel sprout salad, and the arancini."}
{"text":"How delighted I was to have a fantastic italian restaurant in my new home of Leslieville. My standards for italian are very high and Ascari has exceeded all my expectations time and again. Lets begin with the space: its cozy, romantic, small but very comfortable = intimate. Service, excellent, wow, great. From the uber-honest bartender who pleaded with me not to pay the extra few $ for hendrick's in my negroni, the server who gave me an entire jar of their spicy oil on the house after i professed my love for it, and everything else, service is on point here.

Food: Each dish i've had was immaculate, delicious, tasteful and artistically prepared. Listen, chicken liver on toast isn't pushing any boundaries, but whipping that liver into a mousse and putting it on fantastic toasted bread and garnishing the way they do, now that is special. 

I'd have to peruse the menu again to give a play-by-play overview of each dish but i will stop and tell  you that the food is incredible, priced right, the service is top notch, the wine menu is extensive and they make great cocktails and the space is really gorgeous.

Book ahead as they are always busy.

See you there!"}
{"text":"Now, my job as an aspiring poet/non-paid food writer doesn't exactly make me a Rockerfeller so I can't afford to eat at Ascari Enoteca too often, but when I treat myself after a long week of slaving away at the corporate ladder, it's well worth it. 

I've been here a few times and after a lovely dinner tonight it's about time I wrote a review. If anything I can comment on consistency. I tend to think that second to food, consistency is the cornerstone to success. I've been known to frequent restaurants with the sh-ttiest of service based only on excellent food and consistency. Happily, Ascari Enoteca has wonderful service, whether you have reservations or not, whether you are sitting at the bar or at a table, whether you're with a group or alone.

Brass tacks. Let's talk food. I can tell you that the Carbonara is the stuff dreams are made of. When you mix up that raw yolk into the perfectly al dente noodle, with those small cubes of ham and sqaush, something magic happens. All that rich creaminess is nearly impossible to finish in one sitting, especially if you opened with an appetizer (which I always do). This evening I started with a unripened mozzarella paired with salsa verde and an anchovy fillet. They cover they mozzarella with a crunchy bread crumb that brings a desserty-sweetness to the cheese, creating the perfect sweet/savoury combo when paired with salsa and anchovy. Between courses I snacked on a dish of warmed olives. I drank Italian beer and sipped ice water. I read Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Talk about the path to happiness.

And then I paid my bill and slipped in to the night, already dreaming of that day where I've saved my pennies and can come back again."}
{"text":"Opened by the the same folks who helm Table 17, Ascari Enoteca is Leslieville's entry into the Amazing Torontonian Enoteca Race. It's fitting then that it's christened for a famed Italian Formula One champion. The resto features racing iconography and postcards regaling diners of its namesake, Albert Ascari; a man who was as enthusiastic about eating as he was with driving at high speeds, i.e., a Man.

Though it isn't enormous, there are quite a few tables inside which make it well suited for groups large or small. The decor is mostly subtle, modern and grey, which is as far from nonna's design sensibilities as I can imagine. I enjoyed the long bar, where bottles of wines slotted themselves into Tetris-like wall shelves.

Their menu comprises of starters, salads, and pasta. Quite simple. The drinks menu is actually more substantial. They have a handful of inspired cocktails (Fernet-marinated kumquat in a Manhattan? Say what?), some bubbles, and a solid selection of red and white by the bottle or glass. When the description promised the that the Cacc'e Mmite di Lucera \"tasted like purple\" we had to order a bottle of this red. Pretty dark and fruity and a respectable match for the eats.

Our foursome started off with the Antipasto Ciccio which was a platter of meats, cheeses and spreads served on a large charcuterie board. It's quite an array: provolone, quince jam, honey comb, a grape seed mustard, pickled veg, honeyed chestnuts, olives, and three kinds of salami all served with a small basket of soft bread. I thought the meats fell a little flat but everything else was interesting enough, and it was sufficient for four people to share. We also ordered the Crostini alla Toscana: three crostinis topped with a generous dollop of chicken liver mousse, capers and sage. I could eat about a dozen of these bad boys. 

The pasta was flawless.Two-bites-in everyone was thrilled with what was on their plate. I was impressed (with myself) for ordering the casarecce with sausage, tomato sauce, peppers, and fennel. Simple but extremely satisfying, and a Big Boy portion. I also snuck a bite of the other pastas on the table; everything was great.

We polished things off with a three-layered semifreddo of maple, quince, and chamomile and cappuccino. A wonderfully light closer to a fantastic meal. With a bottle of wine, an appetizer and dessert dinner for two came to $120, which is well worth it. I shall return!

Obligatory Title Pun: Leave V-ROOOOM for dessert!

Menu Readability: Fabulous design. And I really dig that azure blue.

Need to mention: At present they only take cash and debit.

What this place teaches me about myself: Did you know that \"a racecar\" is a palindrome?"}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal we had last night to celebrate a family anniversary.  We preplanned a family style dinner and  having never been to
the restaurant before we were delighted and blown away by each course.  Everything from the salads to the bread to the arancini (outstanding!) and freshly prepared pastas to the final dessert of nutella doughnuts made us all very happy.  Special shout out to Laura our waitress who was terrific. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We saved coming to Ascari Enoteca for a special occasion. I wish we hadn't waited. The food was amazing and the service was down to earth. I wasn't sure how much you could innovate on Italian but the chefs here really know how to take the food to the next level. Make sure to save a bit of room for dessert."}
{"text":"OMG.  This is the kind of place that serves food you think about days later.  I had a simple pasta dish with sausage and peppers with a nice wine, Each mouthful of the pasta was incredible and I did not want it to end.  The flavours were so inspiring and unique.  A beautiful place and experience."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday evening after work with some friends.  Great corner location (we were all able to find parking close on the street).  
The restaurant is small and intimate, with large glass windows all the way around.  Nice dark modern furniture.  
The front door was sort of odd, as I had to double check I was entering the correct place.  You open the door, and then have the push aside a curtain of sorts to actually get in the restaurant.  I guess this is the keep the draft out which I figure would be problematic for those sitting close to the door.  

This is some really good italian food.  I had chicken liver mouse crostini, which was delicious and then a pasta dish as my main course.  Being with a large group, we all tried a little from each other's appetizers and mains.  I think everything I tried was delicious.  The stewed eggplant was very good and the antipasto was nice.  The staff were friendly, professional and very knowledgeable about how the food is prepared, purchased, etc. (as they should be).  

Good small place... would come here again.  Very nice."}
