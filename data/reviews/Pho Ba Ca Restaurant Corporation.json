{"text":"I was completely unfamiliar with my surroundings.  Nothing faintly resembled state-side Chinatown's; it was far more grimy and populated by non-Asians, which made me more or less skeptical.  The ordering system was also different, in which the customer writes down the order number instead of a waiter -- then again, I noticed the restaurant was staffed by only two people.

On the one hand the food was very average, but on the other it was indisputably true to Vietnamese cuisine (i.e. pho, ca phe sua da).  Despite the super laid-back service we enjoyed the sweet company and conversations with the manager and chef, though I probably will not plan on revisiting."}
{"text":"This place is open until 5am during the week and 7am on weekends. The food is great,  always really consistent, delicious and affordable. Service is good  but we prefer to do take out."}
{"text":"My friends took me here for a late night grub one time. We got to sit wherever we wanted, which was nice. I ordered a small Pho with Rare Beef & Meatballs. It was Ok, nothing special to rant about. My friends ordered Pad Thai and SpringRolls. 

Overall, our experience was Ok. We never received water like requested so my friend just ordered shakes to go."}
{"text":"The best Pho and spring rolls I've ever had, hands down. This place is a must-try!"}
{"text":"The review below did an excellent job of warning about how grime this place really is and to ignore the randoms that walk in or stroll along the parking lot.

This place is open till 5/6am and staff don't speak English well. The ordering system is much like every other Pho place. Numbered. 

The few to MUST try here 
Avocado shake - deliciously creamy. It's a surprise to everyone that tries it. Pre warning - it isn't light by any means. It's VERY creamy and high in fat. 
Spring rolls - oddly fantastical ^_^
chicken wings - the wings taste SO different. I don't know what it is but I've never had wings anywhere like this. It's def worth a try. 
Calamari - pretty delicious. Comes in a small portion so it will go fast in a group :p 

Order:
 Steamed white rice with grilled chicken and egg (sunny side up ) :)
 Steamed rice and spring rolls
Chili chicken and rice - spicy 

 The price is dirt cheap and the service is fast-  so after a night of drinking, dancing and sweating, it's a pretty happy ending for everyone here. (he he he)

{"text":"One of Mississauga's finer establishments. haha. I joke of course.

Being situated where it is, don't be surprised at it's dingy, under lit, poorly painted interior; which of course draws only the \"best\" and not-at-all-scary customers. lol. For some reason the best pho restaurants seem to look or be in the most sketchiest of areas, and this resto stands no different. Can't expect much in terms of decoration or ambiance. However, it's the food that matters.

I've grown accustom to liking their pho. I didn't at first, but something about the taste of their broth that I enjoy. I typically get pho with rare beef and beef balls, also adding tripe (which is a $2 extra charge I believe).

The thing I LOVE and always go back for is their summer rolls! Nowhere else compares to it. This roll has the glutinous rice paper on the outside with fillings of lettuce, vermicelli, shrimp, cucumbers, and CHICKEN! All other places I ate at always have beef in it. The chicken is a rare treat. And oh so yummy!

This place is definitely a Late Night joint as it typically closes at 5:00 am everyday. Again, don't be surprised at the type of people who walk in at this time. Last time I went there, there happened to be the sketchiest drunk person. But he kept to himself and didn't bother anyone, so I can't really complain.

I don't eat there often though. I much rather get take-out."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say having a good Pho place near my house is a requirement but it was definitely on my mind when I moved to the neighbourhood.

I've been to Pho Ba Ca a few times in the last couple of years and I've always been happy with the quick service and good food.

I rarely get anything but a large Pho tai (rare beef soup) and fried spring rolls but everything else I've tried was delicious. If you love pho you know that the key is in the broth and Pho Ba Ca's broth is very good.

Pho tai is my comfort food and this place i walking distance now so I'll be back very very often.

They are also open super late so it's perfect for those midnight pho cravings (you know what I mean right?!)."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after work one night looking for some quick Vietnamese. I used to live in 'sauga and had ordered take out Pho from here about 10 years ago (it's been around forever) and it was decent. Although I don't think I really knew what Pho was back then, I just ordered what was popular on the menu.

This place is open late, like till 5am. They have all the usual dishes. On this occasion I ordered Curry chicken & Noodles or something like that, which was really just that. Nothing more. Chicken and noddles in a curry sauce, with a few bean sprouts thrown in. A little more could have been added to this dish, some green or something? it was a odd brown color but tasted good so I wolfed it down.

My friend orderd the usual Vermicelli noodles and beef. He said it was pretty good and the fried roll was one of the best he's had in a long time.

It's kinda sketchy but don't let that deter you. Check it out if you're up at 5am and are craving Pho."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Only giving a two star out of pity. 

Since it's always empty there, you can hear microwave beeps in the back. 

We got fried spring rolls, pho, and rice platter. 

I personally have always thought all pho places taste the same, but man oh man.. 

The rice platter I got was - obviously - microwaved. Extremely small portion. Cucumbers and tomatoes were dry from being left out for so long, and the chicken had this weird sweet taste. Pork was slightly dry (but tolerable). Like I am just baffled at this place. Sitting here marvelling at it's shittiness as I write this review. 

So yeah, please don't come here. 
PLEASE. I beg of you."}
{"text":"Before coming in here, my friend warned me that this Pho joint was ghetto but the food was good and cheap, was she ever right! We got hit on right in the parking lot right before we could walked inside...im guessing its the area lol.

We ordered the pork spring rolls, which was indeed delish. My friend ordered the rice dish with pork chop and a fried egg. For myself the chicken fried rice. The prices were about $7-$9 for the rice dishes and the pho prices from $5-8 which is pretty standard. The service couldve been alittle better considering there was only myself, my friend and a couple of other people in this restaurant. It kinda has like a old basement decor type of feel to it, It definately needs a little TLC. The washroom was out of order for some odd reason. Overall im not sure if id come back but the food was good and the portions as well...maybe later on this place will get better."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for late night pho since I can remember. The food is good and cheap but the decor is depressing. There is a way nicer pho mi 99 near my house so they stole my business but I still come here every once in a while."}
