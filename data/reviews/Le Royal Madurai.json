{"text":"Nice Ambience and excellent service.
One of the best places to go for authentic South Indian food in Montreal.!"}
{"text":"This place serves authentic south Indian food. Sometimes, it gets very spicy so beware of it. Naan, Roti and other toasted breads they serve are good and the curry that goes with it also tastes good. Try having a Mango Lassi which is like a milk shake."}
{"text":"Another JustEat find for work lunches. $3 delivery charge, most importantly, the Thali deals aren't served in traditional unilateral styrofoam but rather individual containers. This made a big difference as I first gawked at the price being about 30% above normal however the volume of food provided allowed me to easily break it down to 2 lunches. The vegetarian dishes were more spicy than I would have assumed, too much kick for those with softer pallets but enjoyable to me. Dishes were much more traditional and less Americanized which was a nice change. Delivery was within their estimated time frame and the driver was nice. Overall would order again but not a go-to."}
{"text":"Review is for a delivery order.

Idli sambar: the idli were dense, but still quite good, and the sambar was flavourful. This was the first part of my meal, and it made me really excited to taste everything else!

Butter chicken: The sauce was good, but I didn't love it, I can't quite explain why. The spices just seemed a bit off.  The chicken, on the other hand, was awful. Very, very dried out boneless tandoori chicken chunks. Seemed like a mix of white meat and dark meat, all of it super dry and stringy. They can try to hide it in the curry sauce, but there's no mistaking what's under there.

Spinach dal: very soupy and a bit underspiced. this would be good to eat if I was sick.

Delivery was quick and friendly, no complaints there. 

Probably won't go back, but if I do, I would try more of the South Indian items (idlis, dosas, etc)."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, We were very impressed. Can't wait to go back.  This restaurant recently opened and the food that comes out of the kitchen is simply fantastic. The attached picture is Samosa Chat, the best we've had ever!!!"}
{"text":"I had veg kurma, chilli gobi and parotta - surely not good. However my friends had ambur biryani , mutton roast , naatu kozhi biryani , prawn pirattal - heard it was really good and they would visit back. So I would say for vegetarian dishes it's not the best."}
