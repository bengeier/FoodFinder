{"text":"The food was less than  nice. However, the service was horrendous,  what I ordered with the waitress before she left the table. After this I ordered desert, which just never came. The waitress also paid almost no attention to our table, im not sure if go there again"}
{"text":"I have been here before during the weekday and week nights and usually have on par service. Tonight was otherwise. Coming on a Friday night dinner rush was an epic fail. We ordered several rounds of AYCE with food items and drinks being missed each time and having to reorder while the third order comes and the first isn't all there yet. Waiters and waitress just not refilling tea. Bummer. Not sure if I'll be back on the weekend. They definitely need more staff to adequately handle their dinner rush."}
{"text":"I have been to Maki 1 on two occasions and the first time, I was actually satisfied with the food and the service was acceptable.  I tend to make large orders to avoid having multiple orders so one thing that did bother me on both occasions is how they limit the number of pieces per dish - eg an order of 18 pieces of salmon sashimi would only get 12 pieces.    So on the second visit, I ordered a variety of sashimi, maki rolls, some teriyaki dishes, and one of my personal favorites - beef and mushroom rolls.   Of course, everything came in limited quantities, and the beef teryaki was like eating leather shoes.  Do not order the mango yogurt thing they have - it is absolutely disgusting.    The servers never once stopped to ask if we needed to re-order any food or refill our drinks.  We had to continually flag down servers and they did not look happy to take orders.    There are plenty of AYCE sushi restaurants all over Toronto - just skip Maki sushi."}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon. Go there for the teppanyaki - make sure you reserve a teppanyaki table beforehand as they do get quite busy.  Upon being seated, learned that it was all you can eat. The teppanyaki cook was very enthusiastic and friendly and put on quite a show for us. The seafood teppanyaki was done well. I especially enjoyed the grilled salmon and flounder. Sushi and sashimi were good but nothing special.  Would rate the food as 4 stars and the cook as 4 stars, but some of the waiters need an attitude adjustment. Here is the bad news: the restaurant screens out groupon users. Tried calling once and mentioning the groupon - sorry all booked up. Called again and made a reservation for the same time without mentioning the groupon. However upon finishing our food, the waiter cross referenced our reservation and refused to honour the groupon. It was only after a lot of hassle that we were able to negotiate a partial deal of the groupon. In addition the waiter was very curt when serving and would scowl when we were ordering food - as though we were ordering too much. As other AYCE, food orders were dropped.  All in all, would go back, but only with the groupon and would reserve well in advance to get a teppanyaki table.  Teppanyaki - 4 stars Chef - 5 stars for attitude Waiter - 1 star"}
{"text":"I've gone to this place plenty of times cause it's in the area. But it's not a dream sushi place I've only really gotten all you can eat sushi but the quality varies from time to time. I once found a bone in my sushi. Something you're not expecting to find when you bite down hard into something you expect to be soft, I almost cut myself. And their way to make up was \"sorry the boss isn't in so we can only give you the taxes off\" I didn't cut myself but I was so grossed out I couldn't eat the rest of my meal and still had to pay for it. The boss did call me and gave me 15 percent off but that was basically to bring me back in their with friends charge us a full amount and take off 10 bucks. Not cool.   On the bright side I got a groupon for their dinner they prepare infront of you and te food was good and the chef was extra friendly ! - but that was before the whole bone issue"}
{"text":"I started going to this place when it had just opened, and the service and food quality was a lot better. Recently, the service is not as great, the items don't arrive together and they forget to bring some of the orders. However, the price is very good and the atmosphere is nice.   The lunch on the weekends is the same price as the lunch on weekdays and the dinner is more expensive. I would go to this place for lunch but not for dinner. The rolls are not as tightly packed either.  Onsite free parking is available and they do take reservations and are very good with accommodating big groups."}
{"text":"This place looks very clean and organized, the staff and works are trying to be as helpful of possible.  Foods taste good and fresh/all you can eat is the best feature of this restaurant.   Mango ice cream and spicy salmon sushi roll are my favourite.  Try it out, Maki Sushi is a good experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The waiters act as if they are doing you a favour. They also watch you eating. I was there with a few girlfriends for lunch and as we were chatting and eating our waiter rudely interrupted to tell us we must finish everything or they will charge us. Needless to say we are not coming back. However, we weren't anyway since the sushi was not fresh and some of the maki had a funky taste.... Back to Hockey Sushi we go. It's near by. All you can eat, fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE HAS CLOSED  Just know what your getting when you go to a place like this...  Decent price for decent all you can eat sushi.  Fish is not the highest of quality, but still good.  A nice variety of other dishes to get with your sushi.  Food comes to the table as each dish is ready and can sometimes take a long time depending on how busy they are.  Service can be bad and if you order a lot at once they often forget something.  They're not great about refilling water and tea, but if you have patience you leave stuffed and satisfied."}
{"text":"We moved close by recently and decided to try their all you can eat sushi dinner for Mother's Day. $22.99 Saturday dinner. They also have teppanyaki AYCE, although I don't know what that menu is like (its on a separate menu). A la carte is also available.  Very good quality sashimi, fresh and big, just like a la carte quality. Cooked foods in general are also above average. Wide selection. Free fountain drinks. Rolls are also yummy and nicely presented but do tend to have a lot of rice. Try their special rice paper roll with veggies and salmon sashimi, very refreshing. Dessert also includes sesame ice cream, fried bananas and crispy pumpkin cake yum! One person from our party had a la cart (chicken bento $12) and it looked decent, but the AYCE is definitely the better value. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Bland Flavourless Crap!  The wife and I did the AYCE on a Friday night with high hopes of another decent local AYCE Japanese place aside from California Roll on Bayview.  Alas, our hopes were dashed with the first disappointing taste of this place and its horrible, horrible food.  The sashimi was bland and tasteless.  The sushi an even greater disappointment since we expected a good quality sushi rice to help offset their inferior fish.  But its clear that the cooking staff know as little about properly preparing sushi rice as the Maki fish buyers have understanding of the meaning of the word \"fresh\".  And really, how can you screw up sashimi? It's just cuts of raw fish!  You really, really have to suck at your job to not be able to tell whether fish is fresh or frozen. A hint for your next shopping trip: frozen fish are solid and very, very cold, so do not buy them.    Even cooked things like their Sirloin steak or various meat skewers were either very undercooked or very overcooked.  This isn't a 10 course Chinese banquet, just meat on a stick.  How can you not tell that you've overcooked it when large sections of it are burned black?    A place this big obviously exists to generate lots of money at as cheap a cost as possible.  What amazes me is that it is filled with Leaside people who should know the difference between quality and crap.  I guess it just goes to show that money doesn't buy good taste."}
{"text":"Bottom line.... sushi was pretty good, service was terrible. I will more then likely go back. But hope the service improves. I will give in one more chance. We waited 25min for a beer... got the wrong order 3 times... and waited as costumers that just walked in got seated , served and left .... booooooo!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. I don't think the food was all that bad but service is lacking on and off rush hours. They were pretty flexible on how I wanted my kitchen food to be made so I was happy about that. Overall I'd come back."}
{"text":"My experience was meh. My shrimp tempura tasted like somebody ordered it, sent it back, and they gave it to me. The dynamite roll was horrible. Everything tasted off. The only thing good about this place was the service. The only reason this is getting 2 stars and not 1 is because my friend seemed to enjoy his meal."}
{"text":"Good selection from regular menu and all you can eat. 21.99 on weekend and 19.99 for weekdays.  I ordered sashimi from reg menu and liked that there was salmon, tuna and surf clams and shrimp. Service was good and price was ok. Was decent and I'd go back to try all u can eat."}
{"text":"The service was very bad; the staff is unfriendly and slow. The food was not that great as expected. I would not come back to Maki sushi. It was quite expensive compared to other restaurants in the area. Kintako or Fukui restaurants are much better places in the area."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick lunch and were pleasantly surprised.  We ordered a Spider roll, a spicy scallop roll, a California roll and some assorted nigiri sushi.  The rolls came with miso soup, which was very good.  The fish was very fresh, and the quality of the sushi was much better than many places we've eaten in in Toronto and rivaled good places in California.  The servers were pleasant and efficient, and the atmosphere nice.  We'll come back."}
{"text":"The food here is good however service as others have mentioned at this location lacking. The other location owned by the same owners as this one in Toronto has servers more attentive"}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time with a friend of mine and was very impressed.  The lunch special was all you can eat for $14!!! Food and service was very good. Sush and chicken fried rice was excellent and chicken pad tai was pretty good..not the best I've had though. Nice environment and will be returning this weekend with my boyfriend!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice looking but the food is disappointing. This is not authentic Japanese cuisine. I suspected it when my order came with a fork for the rice.The sauces were too sweet, the miso shiro too salty and I was served me the wrong order.  The friendly waiter/manager promptly brought the correct the order after I noted that one order came with one missing item. Service is great. But the food is not."}
{"text":"The sushi and maki were not rolled very well and kept falling apart. Nothing was very flavorful. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went here twice, first time for AYCE and second for AYCE teppanyaki. The normal AYCE has a lot of options, food is fresh and portions are good. The teppanyaki menu is pretty small. Doesn't have a lot of options, sushi menu is much smaller and their normal food selection is reduced to about 10ish items and also doesn't include deep fried banana for dessert but does have green tea ice cream. However, the chef was really fun and did cool tricks so that was nice :) Will return for normal AYCE."}
{"text":"Ok.  Decided to give Maki Sushi another try.  This time we went on a Saturday around 5:30ish.  Service was MUCH MUCH better.  Staff was attentive even though the place was much busier.  The food seems to be a little small on the portion size, but this is typical of ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI places.  I like the ability to order Brown or White rice on some rolls.  I'm holding out for a few more visits to see, but for now I give it a 'cautious recommendation'."}
{"text":"As you can see, I have not written a review on here in ages but after having gone to Maki Sushi I had to make my long-awaited return to Yelp because I want to save my fellow Torontonians a trip to this place if/when in doubt!   I went to Maki Sushi about a week ago with my mom and my sister and we decided to go for the All You Can Eat menu. We went there on a Saturday afternoon and despite that, the place was not busy at all.   Where should I begin? The service was horrible right from the start. We had 3 grumpy waiters serving us, none of which had an iota of interest in customer satisfaction. We ordered some hand rolls, some edamame, shrimp tempura, two Misu soups and helped ourselves to some seaweed salad as well (salads and desserts are placed in an open fridge nearby where customers can go and pick out whatever they like).  When the food arrived, the hand rolls were falling apart, the edamame was hot and cold (microwaved for 10 seconds?!) and our handpicked seaweed salad tasted like shredded cardboard painted green with a Sharpie!   When my mom informed the waiter that the Misu soup was cold, the waiter only replaced her Misu soup as I turn invisible on Saturdays. Our water was not refilled even ONCE while we were there and our order of shrimp tempura never came.   After waiting for our waiters to finish eating too, (they were sitting 2 tables across from us), we finally got our bill and were surprised to find out that there is 10% gratuity included in the bill for service which we never received.   If I could give this place 0 stars out of 5 instead of the 1, I totally would!"}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with the food here, in fact I think it's quite good. I live around the corner and so this place use to be a regular in my repertoire.   They raised the prices of their meals three times in under 18 months which was really the beginning of the end for Maki Sushi. A basic bento box of any sort is now more expensive here than any other sushi restaurant in a 10 km radius. Over the last few months was the very last straw when they decided that on takeout orders you now have to choose between soup and salad instead of offering both.   If you're looking for all you can eat, then the food is pretty good at a slightly above average price. If you want anything other than AYCE then you're much better off elsewhere where you can find better value and selection for that matter."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here! There's a way better sushi joint down the street. Ordered a bento box and asked to make sure that the 2 vegetable tempura that already comes in my box to be sweet potato and then the waiter says additional 1.50 because that is a change from the menu. Later on I get my box what was described on the Menu was not what I got. I asked the lady and she simply says we changed it but didn't care to ask me if that was ok. She wouldn't take it back and even though it was false advertisement, she didn't care. The bento box I got was priced at 18.99!!! I've been to places with way better food for less than 12 dollars."}
{"text":"Sure, the food was alright. But the service was horrible. We had to repeat multiple times to the waitresses that we needed water and when we asked for our bill we spent a good fifteen minutes waiting for the debit machine when the restaurant was dead. Never coming back AGAIN."}
{"text":"This is the the worst restaurant ever do not go. I went there this Friday and it was jam packed. We get in and they take our order and everything is fine. 20 minutes later they come with half our food. When we finish it we try waiving one of the 3 waitresses but they say\" one sek\" for 20 minutes straight. I'm not even over exaggerating. Then when we finally get one to listen to us they are like \"we ran out of rice\"! We ordered the rice 40 minutes ago! We get the bill and its 20$ per person. We argue with the crazy waitress for 10 minutes when she tells us to go speak to someone else.( the manager was continently not there that day). We speak to this crazy Sophia girl and she is like I'm calling the cops if you don't pay. So we had to pay and that girl deserves to get fires because we argued with her for 10 minutes straight and she was so rude. I'm never going back there and Sophia should feel ashamed."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Dirty table, menu, cutlery and cups. Recycled (or appears to be), tasteless, crappy quality food. What else can be wrong???????"}
{"text":"Some items are good such as the house specialty like the Snow Roll a roll which is wrapped in rice paper not seaweed on the outside.   The green onion beef roll, salmon terrikayi, mushroom beef roll, ramen, desert specialties like the crispy rice dumpling and pumpkin cake were also good.   Could improve in the freshness of the items such as the shrimps and scallops.   Service was excellent. Not one item was missed when ordered. The waiters were approachable and friendly.    A good option for all you can eat if you're in the area, there was all the basics a bit more to keep it interesting."}
{"text":"Worst service, worst sushi, and dishonest billing. Don't come here. The waiters are rude. They routinely bring you items other people ordered, the sushi itself is below average and very simple. At the end of the visit, they automatically add a $5 \"service fee.\" Their machine does not permit a tip of less than 15%. The worst sushi experience I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant in history. We came right at the end of lunch and they charged us for dinner. The food took a very long time to come. The service was horrible. They did not list kids price on menu and charged us $8 each child when we just gave our kids a bit of our noodles. We have to even return the noodles the first time because it tasted like gasoline. The food is less than mediocre and is not fresh whatsoever. The manager throw dishes on the table, sucked her teeth when we explained to her about the charge for the kids. If I can give zero stars I would. This place should not be in business."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night around 7:30 PM. Have been to this location twice before and have had positive (but not outstanding or memorable) experiences. On this particular night there was a large party that had taken over most of the restaurant; however we were still seated right away.  It was not a great experience from the get-go.  A bit annoying that this place still uses paper menus rather than the tablets most AYCE restaurants do now. Several mistakes were made on our orders and some things never came at all.  One of my friend's dishes took 45 mins to come out after we asked twice about it. The worst was our server who either ignored us or was outright rude. We complained to the manager who didn't care that we had a poor experience; my pop wasn't on my bill but I think they forgot to charge me rather than comped it to make up for how terrible the experience was.  It took so long to eat we couldn't even be bothered to have ice cream.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went for lunch to Maki Sushi, and did not expect that a meal becomes a \"theatre of the absurd\". Among other things, I ordered a Salmon Skin Roll. When they brought the order, I discovered that there is no salmon skin in this roll at all. It was just a cucumber and «crispy» - crumbled roasted dough. I opened the next roll - indeed, no trace of salmon skin. I call a waiter. - I ordered a Salmon Skin Roll, and this is a Crispy Roll. - No, it's Salmon Skin Roll. I show him an open roll. - And where is the salmon skin? - We are preparing a Salmon Skin Roll with the mixture of salmon skin and «crispy». - OK, but where is the salmon skin? Here is nothing but «crispy». - We currently do not have salmon skin. We are preparing a Salmon Skin Roll with only «crispy». - But then it is not Salmon Skin Roll. It's Crispy Roll. - No, it's Salmon Skin Roll. We prepare it from a mixture of salmon skin and «crispy». - And where in this mix (again show him an open roll) salmon skin? - He is not here, because we have not prepared it yet. - Then, prepare and bring me what I ordered - Salmon Skin Roll. - We've brought you your order, sir. Here it is... And he points on the open roll. - But there's no salmon skin! - Yes, sir. This is a mixture of salmon skin and «crispy» in which no salmon skin. 90% of our customers do not pay attention on it. - But I'm not interested in 90% of your customers. I ordered a Salmon Skin Roll, and I want to receive my order. - You already got it, sir ... - Can I talk to the manager? - It's me, sir... No comments... :) In addition, the waiters have little understanding of English, mix up orders, bring what you have not ordered and vice versa - do not bring what you ordered, often working in pairs - one takes the order, the other (more experienced) translates him what you said. The sushi was made \"wrong\" - carelessly, and fall to pieces. A tip, meanwhile, is included in the bill in advance, \"by default\"..."}
{"text":"pricey considering the quality of the sashimi. spicy salmon sushi wasn't spicy at all. no toilet paper. reused the same glass for pop."}
{"text":"It is a good place. Foods are not super delicious, but they are fine. They have varieties in their menu. They have most of dishes I want to eat. The place is clean and nicely decorated. Seats and tables are comfortably good size, so I can relax and have some privacy. If I were in the area, I would come back if I want to eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely perfect for the tepanyaki. There are not many tepanyaki restaurants around the downtown. This one is definitely worth the value. You enter and are seated around the grill. The exhaust they turn on is rather loud and cooling. But with the AYCE, the whole experience opens up. You can order tempura, you can order sashimi, as well as sushi. And we ordered all of that and shared. The spring rolls are also rather refreshing.   The next course is the reason we are here though. It's the tepanyaki. We have ordered each pieces of what we want. There are 6 of us and we all have different preferences. Some will only eat seafood. Some only eat meat. But all of us appreciate the good natured chef. And the fresh selection of seafood ( scallops, shrimp, mussels, salmon) and meat( steak, short ribs, beef, chicken). All of that and mix it with veggies and fried rice. It's enough to satisfy 6 foodists.   Definitely worth it. They didn't scrimp in taste nor personality."}
{"text":"This is my go to Ayce sushi spot. I have been going for years and have never had a bad meal.  The menu has options for everyone. Fresh made maki and hand rolls are always delicious.  They also have a lot of menu options for those people that want a bit more with their sushi. Their stir fry dishes, and hot apps are always on point."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times and in the beginning found that service is not very good and it took long time for the food to come and usually a few items were missing. However, my last time was better. Even though the place was full (as always), they greeted us and order arrived very fast. They have been constantly cleaning the table and bringing new items.  On the other hand, I believe that food quality became worst. Many items are not tasty and have too much oil in them.  Overall, it is a nice place that can be visited once in a while."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and to get take out.  Staff are always super friendly, professional, efficient and attentive.  Each time I've eaten here I've walked away satisfied with the quality of the food and service for the cost.  In fact, hubby said that the lunch portions are quite generous (he had a bento box).  Recently ordered a party platter as well and it was nicely presented and well prepared with a generous amount of soy sauce on the side.   I'm happy with my experiences here and will not hesitate to come back.   I have not tried AYCE at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday evening.  Service was bad.  We were given 3 a la carte menus for 6 people, two weren't even at the table and we'd been asked twice if we're ready to order.  The terriaki beef went from rare to over done in 6inches.  The serving size was good and the a la carte price good but hard getting past the server. Second time here, probably the last."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday on an impromptu birthday lunch with two friends! We were seated promptly and decided to do ayce for $13.99.  Ordered miso soup, seaweed salad, quite a few rolls (green dragon, spicy salmon, california, avocado roll, crispy), beef short ribs, mushroom beef and some skewers.   We got our rolls first - green dragon was the best and the rest didnt taste that great. Spicy salmon and avacado roll was okay. The rest tasted off - especially crispy roll.   The meat entrees I heard were good especially the mushroom suffed beef (?).   We didnt get our miso soup or seaweed salad and had to ask twice. Both were good.   We ended the lunch with mango ice cream for myself and mango pudding for my friends! The pudding was a joke - barely enough for one spoon. It was in a taster cup!!   To end - I didnt really enjoy it that much. Bayview has a few that are better!"}
{"text":"Had dinner and opted for the regular menu instead of the all-you-can-eat. We ordered tonkatsu bento and chicken Katsu bento.  The service is sub standard, even for a Chinese run sushi restaurant; the food was bland.   To top the evening off, 10% service charged was automatically charged and was not pointed out. When paying with credit card, no option was provided for 'No Tips' on the machine."}
{"text":"The food was very nice. However, the service was horrendous. We placed 3 orders for food. Every one of them was extremely wrong, despite confirming what I ordered with the waitress before she left the table. After this I ordered desert, which just never came. The waitress also paid almost no attention to our table, even getting water refills was a struggle. To add insult to injury, we were charged a mandatory tip on our table of two people. Will never be returning."}
{"text":"All you can eat place!  Because it's all you can eat, the sushi wasn't the freshest and some sushi rolls were falling apart. Although for all you can eat it's not a bad place.   The servers were quick - but there weren't a lot of people in the restaurant. (Not peak hours).   Make sure to double check your tea before drinking because mine had some extra protein in it..."}
{"text":"Worst customer service at an all you can eat. The waiter did not want to give us a booth because he said he wanted to reserve for a larger party. We were the only table in the whole restaurant at this time (3:30pm) so I wasn't sure where he was expecting a random large party walk in.   Majority of the staff stood there and gossiped. Didn't offer tea or water. No wasabi or ginger was offered when our items came. Food was average (some were still semi-frozen)   Overall- shitty service with average food. Rather go to sobeys and grab the sushi from their sushi bar which says a lot"}
{"text":"Very classic Asian fusion resto. Nice atmosphere and good place for what we went for (company luncheon). Very good deal for the all u can eat buffet with a lot of choices! Service was on point the entire time and handled our big group wonderfully! I would definitely go back when in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"First off I have to start by stating there are two Maki Restaurants right next to each other.  There is Maki I (no teppanyaki) and Maki II (has teppanyaki).  Maki I (the restaurant with no Teppanyaki) is absolutely terrible.  The food is awful and the restaurant smells like lake Ontario when it smells like fish.  It was really bad and I didn't want to eat there but did.  Maki II (the restaurant with Teppanyaki) used to be really good when they first opened.  Then the restaurant just went downhill.  I tried it a few more times after my amazing experience and they always seemed to disappoint me.  The waiter would glare at you when you ordered more food (Ayce Sushi) and you could tell they didn't want you to really eat that much.  When I did Teppanyaki the last time they were out of all of the expensive fishes.  We could only order some of the inexpensive fish on the Teppanyaki menu which costs over $28.00 per person (I can't remember the actual price).  I definitely left unsatisfied and don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"I was here with my family twice and the service was good both times and they had a lot of choices. The food was tasty and sushi we had were fresh. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Today I decided to write a review of as many AYCE Sushi places as I can remember going to as I tend to like finding new places for Sushi regularly. After writing up a few reviews for other places that got higher average scores, I was surprised to find that the score here wasn't that good. It's not that my score of a 3 is awesome, it's just that I find Maki better than other places that are getting 4s on average. :P  In fact, while Maki is definitely not the best place in Toronto, it's good enough that I would consider going back again after the few times I've been already. It's a solid option and if you're in the area shopping and want to pig out, you'll be fine with Maki. :)"}
{"text":"I've seen this place go downhill in recent years...  I don't know if it's the fact that the owners feel that they now need to cater to pretentious Thornhill patrons, or if it's because they opened a second restaurant right next door, but the service and quality has dwindled as of late.  They have a cute coupon card.. visit Maki 9 times, and your 10th time is free... however, prices are sky-high ($24.99 on a weekend), and tip (15-18%) is always tacked-on to your bill.  I would consider skipping this place..."}
{"text":"Terrible. Don't waste your time or money.   Tea was lukewarm. Salad has French dressing it appears!!  Had beef teriyaki. Beef was greasy and tougher than any steak I've ever had in a restaurant. Very few vegetables. The rice was the only thing they didn't screw up. Not worth a visit, ever."}
{"text":"I've been here a lot of times. This is probably my favorite all you can eat place.  They have a great variety on the menu and you can always get a table  Sometimes they bring you the wrong order, or forget to bring you something,  The service is nonexistent. You get your food. That's it.  I ordered noodles once and they brought me inconsistently warm noodles with chicken. I asked for no chicken (vegetarian) and was upset that they brought me poorly microwaved food. When I politely requested the correct order, our waiter was so rude and brought me udon noodles instead. This was really petty and stupid of him. Poor service because they get their 10% mandatory tip."}
{"text":"We came here for teppanyaki. The menu selection is pretty good. They have a decent selection of seafood ranging from mussels, salmon, to scallops. For meat, they have chicken, steak, beef rolls, mushroom beef rolls, and short ribs. You can also order sushi. Their sushi selection was decent. I like how they have octopus and squid. My favourites! Noodles, rolls, and various kitchen stuff round out the menu.  Since I consider this a teppanyaki restaurant, I don't put much weighting on sushi menu. But it's passable if it was just a regular sushi AYCE place. All the items on their sushi menu can be found almost anywhere. We didn't order much from the sushi menu. But it certainly didn't hurt the score I'm giving it. It's a nice option.  The teppanyaki experience was passable. If you're considering going, you should ask yourself why you want teppanyaki. If you want a show where the chef does tricks, Maki Sushi is NOT the place to go. Maki Sushi's teppanyaki is decent value for delicious food. If you want a show, you need to go to more upscale places. The food will probably taste the same though as Maki uses pretty high quality ingredients. The chef does exactly one trick, and that is to set the table on fire. Looks cool.   Maki loses points on being lame on ordering. If you arrive early, you have to wait maybe 20 minutes for everyone to place their order and also for the kitchen to prep the stuff. The wait didn't bother me as much as how they keep screwing up our portions. Don't bother asking for multiple portions. If feels like they will give you the same portion no matter what. So it's not as \"AYCE\" as they advertise. They only do 2 rounds of cooking. They actually forgot to give me vegetables. I know scallops can be a little expensive but being stingy somewhat ruined my experience. And how do you forget to give me vegetables? Maybe it's because we had a Groupon? Or maybe I was the only one who wanted vegetables so it was not worth the effort of prepping it in the kitchen?   In between waiting, you'll probably end up ordering some sushi. Which is what happened. On the bright side, everything we ordered was delicious.   As usual, I don't mind bad service too much. I generally only care about the food. The experience is what I make of it with whoever I'm with. So I can overlook this ordering fiasco because the prices are not bad at all. Teppanyaki is about $29 pre tax. It's a bit more expensive than your regular sushi buffet but I think it's worth it for the seafood stuff. And there's something about watching food cooked in front of you that's satisfying. There are several teppanyaki places in GTA but most are not AYCE, and many of them are significantly more expensive. Maki Sushi is the place to go if you want AYCE teppanyaki at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Went here tonight nothing impressive about best thing is location  Would not go here again in a rush everything is bland  Salad was over priced"}
{"text":"We went to Maki Sushi with a Groupon  coupon for AYCE sushi  and Teppanyaki. Prior to going I didn't have high expectations because usually Good AYCE sushi places don't do Groupons.  We were very pleased with both the food quality and service.  First we started off with sushi and sashimi, the selection was good and fresh.   Then came the Teppanyaki. We went with the combo, with was little bit of everything. The Teppanyaki chef was very professional and nice.  We had a full house at our Teppanyaki counter, about 18 people in total with 2 chefs. The food was excellent and everything was cook to perfections. Very fresh and flavourful.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try Teppanyaki experience."}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for a while. At first it was ok. The food was pretty good.Mainly was going back because they has squid sashimi. Very crowded and squishy though. So if your looking for some space, wrong place to get it. Service was ok, kept not giving us the amount that we ask for. kind of irritating that way. Would I go back? Probably but we'll see.  Hope this helps!!"}
{"text":"Headline: Listen to Yelp,  not friends. Date of last visit: Jan 24, 2014 # of visits before review: 1  Came to this place based on  recommendation from friend.    Order: 4-5 maki rolls, grilled salmon, grilled mackerel, cold tofu, agedashi tofu, hot and sour soup, chicken cutlet  Likes: The hot and sour soup was okay. Price is alright at 13.99  Dislikes: *Disorganized service. Came to our table 4 times with the wrong order.   *While not a lot of rice on the rolls themselves, it was mostly filling and not a lot of fish.  Full of cream cheese, veggies and/or tempura bits.  I'm not gonna differentiate the rolls because they all tasted very similar....yuck * Grilled salmon was charred and burnt on the outside, so  it's probably not the freshest.  *Automatic 10% gratuity.  If you are going to do an auto-grat, please do 15% so the servers will care.  Verdict: Skip"}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this by saying I already ate.  That being said, I wasn't very happy with the service. Basically, your average all you can eat sushi place, except a little shittier...  We ordered the salmon sashimi -which wasn't bad - but not fantastic.  Overall, I felt as though they were spraying msg. ALSO I found the portions a little small and the bill a little pricy. What more need be said?"}
{"text":"This place have really good sushi. This is the second time I had sushi in my life and I was impressed."}
{"text":"I visited Maki Sushi in a group of 6 for the all you can eat lunch special, which comes to just over $15.00 per person after tax and mandatory gratuity. At the onset of ordering, I made certain to inform my waitress of my life threatening shellfish allergy and requested that my food be prepared on a clean board and with a clean knife. She didn't quite understand what shellfish was, so I explained to her that it included crab, shrimp, lobster, oysters, etc. She looked at what I had ordered and said there was no shellfish in any of it, as if confused. I explained again that I couldn't eat anything that had touched shellfish, and she seemed to understand and walked off to put in the order.  When the food came out, it was plated with an order of shrimp tempura rolls, and there were obvious signs that the same knife was used to cut both sets of rolls (tobiko from the shrimp rolls were stuck in the cuts of my rolls). Seeing this, I tracked down our waitress and requested that my rolls be remade with a clean knife. She took away the plate, and returned less than a minute later with the same rolls on three separate plates. Noting that this was not a fix, I again asked her to have the rolls remade, and explained again about cross contamination. She took my order back to the kitchen once more.  About 20 minutes after that, I was still left without any of my food. I tracked down the waitress again and asked where it was, as the group I was with was finished eating and were waiting on me. She was again confused and asked if I wanted to order more of the same rolls. I managed to communicate that my original order was still missing, and she assured me she would check on it. About 5 minutes later, one of the two rolls I had ordered (an avocado and cucumber roll) arrived at the table, along with all the bills, split 6 ways. Since the group was ready to leave, I figured I should just request that I get charged for the avocado roll, as I didn't get the rest of my order and it didn't warrant paying $15 for one roll.   When I got to the cash register and made this request, the gentleman got very aggressive and said that it was MY fault for not contacting the manager before we got the bills, that there was nothing he could do because the bills were already issued, and that I would have to pay the $15. I explained that I had communicated several times with the staff, that the food brought to me would have put me in the hospital had I eaten it, and that it was unreasonable to charge the full amount when this was clearly a failure of training the staff to handle food allergies, as well as a failure in communication between the waitress and the kitchen. The gentleman at the cash register insisted that he was the manager, that I should have told him right from the beginning about the problem (though I feel informing a member of the staff should more than fulfill my obligation to notify the management - is the waitress unable to speak with the people necessary to handle a request for allergy free dining?), and then he threatened to take down my licence plate number and PRESS CHARGES should I not pay the full $15.   This argument continued for several minutes, with the manager making ridiculous accusations about how I should have known that the bill would be issued before my food was completed, that I should have told someone I had an allergy (which I had done), that I should have told someone my food wasn't prepared (which I had also done), that he was incapable of creating a new ticket for just the item I had been given, and that I should wait and have the rolls made so I could take them with me. I was hesitant to take rolls to go after seeing how poorly they had handled my allergen issues. Finally the \"manager\" started begrudgingly saying that he would \"pay for it out of his own pocket\", and kept repeating \"You're getting a FREE MEAL! FREE MEAL!\" Which is laughable, considering that a $4 avocado roll - which I offered to and WANTED to pay for - is hardly a \"free meal\".   I will NEVER go back. It is experiences like this that make me hesitant to dine out as a person with life threatening allergies."}
{"text":"I have come here in and off for years. Tried all you can lunch and dinner, a la carte and take out. I was really disappointed when they took away the teppanyaki a few years ago. I was here last night for AYCE dinner. The menu has changed somewhat over the years. The AYCE menu has a lot of options. Healthy options as well. They have taken off beef ribs and snow crab off the menu. I liked the grilled eggplant, chicken ramen, beef roll green onion, chicken wings, chicken skewer, futomaki roll. Old sashimi selection and special items pressed sushi on the weekend. Everything tasted freshly made to order. Presentation was nice. Service friendly. Kitchen didn't come out as fast in the middle but it was acceptable. Overall great AYCE place in the area."}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers here on Yelp, my first visit to Maki Sushi is based on a Groupon deal. Money-wise, it was a pretty lucrative deal and was a huge draw for the group of us. I've gone to other sushi restaurants in large groups before, and the bill always ends up staggeringly high, so this is the one area that Maki Sushi definitely excelled in.  However, I was not too impressed with the service, starting with the accommodations. Despite making a reservation in advance, and arriving a few minutes early, there had been a mix-up and we weren't served right on time. It wasn't like we were in a hurry or anything, but this was still a minor inconvenience that kind of annoyed us.  Maki Sushi has a pretty decent selection in their menu, but we feel the food tasted just mediocre at best. It might be because we came on a particularly busy evening, where the restaurant was packed with people, so it felt like the food was prepared in a rush with disproportionate rations among us. We also placed some orders that never arrived, and we had to order the same items again before the food was finally served to us.  Overall, I wasn't too impressed with the food quality or the customer service. I suppose that's one of the drawbacks to a cheap meal - you get the quality that you pay for."}
{"text":"Place was clean, nice atmosphere. Was busy at dinner time and the service was still pretty good. The food was great, better than some other places I've been too. I wouldn't say it was the best sushi ever though. I'd go back again, price was ok compared to other sushi places."}
{"text":"this is my first time buying a groupon deal - and here we are on a friday evening.  the groupon deal was a bit confusing... basically we get 59 dollars to spend on whatever we want, fair enough. alcohol is NOT included in the dinner. make a reservation, or they won't accommodate you. and when i got there, they questioned me like airline security. They had to confirm a few times before they can let us sit.  appatizers - all sat in a little fridge and you go get whatever you want. all cold, non-fresh looking, covered in seran wrap.  some teppanyaki dishes were quite nice, i liked the tiger shrimp, scallop, flounder fish, veggies very much. i did not like the steak, chicken fried rice, or any of the sushi dishes. if you ever wanted more teppanyaki things grilled, forget it, they will put ur raw seafood in the open till they collect dust in front of you and pretty much make you wait till you give up and walk out - that's what we did. dessert - seran-wrapped, refridgerated goodies.  we ended up paying a bit more in the end - cuz of the tips and tax and things. food was kind of subpar, don't think i'll visit again."}
{"text":"A few of my friend recommended that I try this place that is located in a brand new plaza that was just built. Finally on a random Saturday I was craving some sushi and decided to go.  Upon entering, the doorway seemed extremely small and not very welcoming but I was greeted and told to wait for a table to be freed up. I waited for approximately 10 minutes and then got seated, which was weird since a full 8 person table was empty with a reserved sign on it, the party still hadn't shown up once I was finished with my hour and a half meal.  The service is what gave it the 2 stars but the food was not good at all. I am a sashimi eater and so I expect a certain level of freshness. That was not present at all. They did have a wide variety of food to choose from and the udon soup noodles weren't too bad but came in the smallest bowl.   I love Japanese food and I have to say that as an Asian person, this specific restaurant was geared more toward the cakers of the world because I thought the food was subpar and not worth the money but all I hear from friends are raves.   So I guess if you're a newb to sushi and Japanese cuisine, give this place a try but I would not recommend this place to anyone who has a refined palate for the good stuff."}
{"text":"The rating is actually 3.5 stars  I went on a Thursday evening, as part of a group of 42 people.  We had about 1/3 of the restaurant reserved and I would recommend this place for large groups.  The all-you-can-eat sushi option was perfect for our group.  Sushi is good and there are a few items worth mentioning: Appetizer: Enoki Beef Maki Sushi: Snow Roll Dessert: crispy rice dumpling with red bean paste and the crispy rice pumpkin cake  Service was very attentive and fast.  We stayed a little past closing and never felt we were being pushed out the door.  Plenty of parking either on the street in front of the restaurant or in the parking lot behind.  The only minor gripe we had is that it got a bit warm towards the end of the evening."}
{"text":"Food: This place gets an extra star for the variety of rolls and options in their lunch menu. None of the AYCE restaurants anywhere near the area have as good of a menu.   The rolls themselves weren't bad for AYCE quality.   Service: Here's where Maki Sushi fails. They forgot items more than once, and when reminded the waiter became frazzled and really stressed out. I was actually concerned about him, seeing as the restaurant was busy and he was going red in the face.  Ambiance: It wasn't an enjoyable restaurant, by any means and possibly one of the most stressed out meals I've had in a while."}
{"text":"One of my favorite resturant in Toronto.  When I visit usually have all you can eat. The food is tasty and the service is good"}
{"text":"To sum up our experience: waitresses are  uninterested in serving us, no knowledge of what they are selling and , slow. But very fresh sashimi otherwise - only redeeming feature.  Sad.    Green tea ice cream had ice crystals in them. Mango pudding came in a tiny disposable plastic shot plastic cup.  Blueberry mousse tasted like the refrigerator - not a popular dessert I guess.  When we spoke to the manager, his response was that it was very fresh it was only made on Monday (this was a Wednesday)... I do not consider 3 day old mousse Fresh.  The other locations are considerably better."}
{"text":"Excellent take out.  We consider ourselves picky sushi eaters.  We went al a cart for $55 and got a mountain of rolls, sides etc. Fresh and very tasty.   This is now our goto take out."}
{"text":"We always order lunch box (delivery). Seriously if not delivery we will not get food for this place. Meat is always dry."}
{"text":"I went to Maki today and it's horrible that I never want to come back. The food is ok, but the sashimi is warm, pretty odd because it has to be cold enough. The salmon slice is too thick that you can't have it once time. One more thing is worse than food is serving. My boyfriend order 2 hand rolls for second time order and half hour later, we ask the waitress if the food is ready and he said he would take our order again. I don't think they are busy too much to forget our order because we are the only customers in the restaurant. I waste my $60 for awful experience and never comeback here again."}
{"text":"It's a great option to have in the area. The restaurant interior is well put together with a small tapanaki section and a visible sushi bar. The food quality has been consistent and fresh. Lunch AYCE is $13.99 and provides above average selection so it's worth the extra buck or two. I personally enjoy their bento boxes and especially their a la carte hand rolls are noteworthy. The service is luke warm so they definitely can work on that."}
{"text":"I just got home from Maki Sushi. I can say it was great and I am overly full. We had amazing service. It may have been because there were 3 groups once we had entered in the restaurant and we were the last ones out. The server was funny and entertaining and the atmosphere of Maki Sushi was sensational, it was a beautiful place and the presentation of the food was quite pleasing.   We ordered Raw Beef, Surf Clam, Calamari, Egg, Mackerel, and Salmon Sashimi. The size of the slices were a nice big portion, unlike other Sushi Restaurants I usually go to. We ordered a bunch of different Dragon Rolls (Green and Red), a bunch of Tempura (Shrimp, Yam, Crab, and Onion) and other Sushi. We found that all of the mentioned were well made and very well presented. We also ordered Mushroom wrapped with Beef, and found that the beef was a little bit overcooked but it was not terrible. Other dishes include Tofu Sushi, Avocado Sushi. and others. I was extremely full after all of this but I had to eat dessert once I found out that they had Sesame Ice Cream. I had 5 scoops of that, Pumpkin Cake, Red Bean Cake, and Deep Fried Banana. At the end of it all I was rolling around uncomfortably, but it was all worth it. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"So I was craving sushi pizza yesterday.  Just really wanted some.  Since my friend lives near this sushi restaurant, and we were at the Starbucks just down the street.  I got a salmon sushi pizza to go.  I decided to call them, and they told me to pick it up in 10 minutes.  Was not very impressed.  1) the salmon was not that fresh; 2) the description was: salmon, spicy sauce, onion, green onion, unagi sauce (what onion and green onions?! I didn't see it!); and 3) the salmon was strangely warm by the time I got it.  Maybe I'll try going for dinner next time... Should I try my chances?"}
{"text":"I've given many chances for this place to impress me because of the one time good service and food 4 years ago.  However, I have given up on you Maki Sushi.  I came here with my friend, excited and reminiscing about my sweet sixteen dinner I had here, hoping to be served the same delicious hand rolls and tempura from back in the day. I was surely disappointed. The second we stepped in and walked by all the disappointed faces in a sea of leftover sushi platters and half eaten tempura messes left on the table, we realized we made a mistake coming here. There were people waiting for their bill or for their food for far too long, and you could feel the tension in the room. The server was stressed out, juggling too many tables for one person. Nevertheless, we dismissed all those things and decided to just order and try to enjoy our time here.  We ordered a variety of sushi rolls, hand rolls, tempura and soups. Lets just say that even Loblaws sushi was better than this. The rice on the sushi rolls were inadequately portioned, dripping in soy sauce, containing minimal vegetables and cold shrimp (why are they skimping out on white rice??) The wasabi and ginger on the side was also missing.The shrimp tempura was not fresh, had a slight fishy smell to it. The batch we ordered was not piping hot and the sauce for it came after we were done eating it.   We ended our sushi experience on very average mango ice cream. The service wasn't too bad, waiters were scattered at times, but luckily, we didn't wait too long for our bill.  This place has definitely gone downhill from the time of its opening. Don't think I'll be checking in here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Been here many times.  Has several very good dishes.  Butter shrimp, amazing. Salmon sashimi amazing. Stir fried vegetables amazing.  There is some confusion from time to time, getting the wrong dishes meant for another table, but atmospheregood, owner very pleasant and they do try hard to ensure your happiness.  Your visit here will be pleasant.  Not the best, but far from the worst.  Worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"WORST RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! Do not come here under any circumstance! I have tried this place out twice (once delivery & once at the place). I will never in a million years, even if this is the last sushi place on earth give this place my business again. I am shocked that this place is even open.   First time I ordered in. Really simple order 3 avocado sushi rolls & a seaweed salad. The food took forever to come & then the delivery guy so so rude, no smile, no hello even & then he even very rudely asked for a tip. The food was ok seaweed salad wasn't the best & the sushi was just ok. Very very small rolls. I was not happy about the size at all.   Second time I went to the restaurant & brought company. I was so embarresed to bring someone here. To make a long story short the service was appalling, they kept messing up our order, bring us food that was not ours, the food was awful. are guest didn't even eat the food it was so gross, they brought entrees first then appetizer to two of us, small portions again plus we had to sort out are bill because they tried to over charge us! On top of all that the table next to us had an issue as well. They brought them the wrong food then tried to charge them for it. The whole thing was just a disaster from start to finish.   You under no circumstance should come here/order from here. It is just plain awful."}
{"text":"Just really mediocre.  Rushed service though the restaurant was nearly empty and wait staff abandoned us during the meal.  $40 for a crap meal, it felt so cheaply done.  Truly such a sad little restaurant, a bit shabby.  I really wanted to like this place.  I hope they can get it together."}
{"text":"As much as I love AYCE sushi places, I am not a fan of Maki Sushi.   Service is fast and the staff was friendly and helpful. We even jokes around with our server, which was a hard worker.   Clean bathrooms and clean restaurant overall. Beautifully decorated.   The downside is the food. The sashimi is dry and the fish is most def frozen. Not acceptable given that the menu advertises it as \"fresh\". The tempura had a great crunch to it. The desserts were alright in general and the fried banana (which was served with chocolate) was fantastic. Overall, the noodles/appetizers and other Asian dishes were insanely bland. Please do yourself a favour and do NOT order the pad thai. Eating their pad thai is like eating water. I had to add about half a cup of sriracha in order to be able to eat it.   I gave the restaurant 2 stars due to the great service but I don't think the food is worth 25.99$."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  It's near my house, in a nice area of town, and I thought that the proximity to affluence would make this a good -quality restaurant.    Boy, was I wrong.  Came for lunch.  And yes, tried the all-you-can eat special.  Did not feel welcome from the get-go.  The girl who sat me and took my order left me feeling like I was imposing on her and her extra-special life.  She clearly did not want to be there.  The sushi just didn't taste right.  I eat sushi regularly and have for many years in many places, and I have never before noticed an unpleasant, fishy, smell associated with any other sushi restaurant or the food I was served there.  It happened here for the first time.  The hand rolls were unappealing and I actually had to force them down.  All the sushi tasted the same, nothing fresh or exciting about it.    Remember, I wanted badly to like this place, so it's hard to recommend other Yelpers avoid it.  But you should.  Seriously.  I am upset I spent seventeen bucks here."}
{"text":"Standard sushi. Nothing really stands out here. Service is there, price is right, but left wanting more. Spicy salmon to me should be a staple of a great sushi place. There is potential here. The kitchen needs to put more love in each roll. Don't get me wrong there are some hits among the misses. Cheers."}
{"text":"Environment was good, enough traffic to know food that was coming out was being made fresh but wouldn't know otherwise. Tempura was overly oily and sweet potato was obviously rushed being slightly undercooked and more apparent with the other tempura pieces. Veggie sushi rolls were well prepared and fresh however the ends were still on the plate and should have not been served. Veggie fried rice had a piece of beef, no biggie just ate around it but very oily. Service is plus at this place no shortage of drinks and very friendly. Good once in awhile sort of joint nothing special or beyond expectations. Swag."}
{"text":"My experience at Maki sushi was at best average. First impressions were not good because they totally mishandled my reservation for 7pm. When I arrived at 6:45, they told me that there was no reservation for me?!? Another family was in the same position as I was so it wasnt a coincidence. So be certain that you get your reservations in for sure.   Seated 30 mins later, we were at a teppanyaki table that was already midway through their meal. That was also disappointing. Food was alright since the ingredients used was fairly fresh.   So I would say \"long story short\" food was alright but management was horrible."}
{"text":"There is terrible sushi in Toronto.   This place however is not one of them. It's  not the best in Toronto either but it's definitely an acceptable solution in relation to Hockey Sushi down the street. The decor is nicer than most places and the service is quick enough to meet ones' needs. The quality of sushi is OK as well as the variety of what is available off the menu.  I also want to state that there are TWO Maki Sushi's in the same area. It's most likely owned by the same person based on the close proximity to one as well as the similar decor. However one is an AYCE sushi and the other is a Teppanyaki restaurant.   I like it, not obsessed with it, but I'm definitely not going to say no to it."}
{"text":"We used to be semi-regular take out and delivery customers. No more!   Last two times were terrible. Meat in bento boxes ($15) is poor quality and very overcooked. Beef looked like shoe leather. No vegetables only a lot of rice and bland over cooked meat. Salad is a couple of pieces of iceberg lettuce (somehow the only part of the head they have to offer is the chunky white interior because that's all anyone in my family ever gets).  They even skimped on the fruit -- the two pieces of orange I got put together was half a slice.    Tempura is good and sushi is OK ( defined as not horrible).   Seriously, Leasiders why are you eating there, there are better Japanese places nearby!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I both like going to Maki Sushi - but try to avoid going there during rush times. When they're busy the service quality plummets and you have to remind staff of the things you ordered? eg. \"Excuse me, I ordered 4 dishes and only 1 of them came. When are the other 3 coming?\" And I don't mean we were waiting 5 minutes for the items to arrive. I am talking 10 minutes and the waitress comes over and asks if we want the bill. \"No, we don't want the bill yet. We are still waiting for the things we ordered.\" On two separate visits the waiter or waitress gave our order to a nearby table by accident. The one time the waiter noticed his mistake after both tables complained. The other time the waitress was oblivious to the mistake and the table which received our food just shrugged and ate it. We still keep going because the place is conveniently close to our home, the food is good and the prices fair. But the service is s***."}
{"text":"There is a real art to making good sushi, something that the majority of sushi restaurants lack, Maki sushi falls into that same category. Sometimes I cant really blaim the restaurant because Torontonian standards for quality sushi is lower than it should be. The fish quality isn't bad and the portions are large but poorly assembled. Would I eat here again? If I'm looking for a quick takeout in the area yes but would drive the distance for something better."}
{"text":"My sister and I came her on Saturday evening. We hadn't eaten all day and by this point, out stomach juices were pretty much digesting air.   Anyways, we did the all you can eat instead of a la carry because we were hungry. Unless you for sure know you're going to pig out, don't get the all you can eat on weekends. $30+tip per person. Plus you can save paper because their pencils have an eraser on the back so you can erased the previous order and order more food.   The place was basically empty. Other than a couple that was probably just as starving as ourselves, the only other people was an older couple that sure knew how to put it down. The employees for the most part were nice. Our server was really nice too. When our new server came, she didn't look interested which we didn't mind.   The sushi, sashimi, hand roll were pretty much like all the other ones when you go to any sushi place. There's a wide selection and variety to pick from. My sister and I really enjoyed the different ways squid and octopus were prepared. Except I kept chocking on octopus rings because the skin wasn't cooked all the way through.   The restaurant is large spacious and for Saturday evening, pretty quiet which was nice."}
{"text":"The food is very good. The service sucks, but this may be due to the attitude of the people living in this area. I've seen many people be rude to the servers. Just be courteous and civil. Great sushi in the area."}
{"text":"Opened with some great momentum a few years back, but I think the glory days are over. The service quality is not the only thing suffering. The food is substantially worse than that of other AYCE sushi places, and they're usually pretty indistinguishable."}
{"text":"Maki sushi to me is losing its touch. I first visited around 2 years ago and I LOVED it, regardless of the fact that there was a gratuity charge at the end of my bill I was pretty satisfied with the service especially the food. I recently visited last month for a friends birthday dinner to find out there were TWO maki sushis. Umm? What? Yeah I know right. Anyway we got to the one where our reservations were supposedly was only to find out that they were clearing and setting up a table for us. Maybe it was the fact that we showed up late or whatever but I let that slide. We got to ordering and I realized the more busier it got the less visits the waiters did at our table. The food took longer and A LOT of food started arriving at our table that we didn't even ask for! I can remember there being around 5 plates being thrown at our table which we never ordered. Anyway we decided to just get our ice cream (which was half a scoop, no lie) pay and go. NO TIP. But overall 3 stars because of my previous visit. If that was my first visit definitely a one star."}
{"text":"I really should be aware when so many yelpers complain about a place to not visit it, but I've had good times in the past when I went frequently a few years ago.  My fiancé introduced me to the world of AYCE sushi a few years ago and Maki was a fave of ours. It was fairly new, quiet and the service was quick! This past time we went, the service was slow, the atmosphere was terrible (screaming children... So many screaming children!!) and the servers were forgetful and rude.  The food itself was great. I enjoyed a lot of sushi (avocado, cucumber, carrot - I don't like fish), some edamame, seaweed salad, and more sushi after that ;)  I was absolutely stuffed when I left - proof that even gfree people can enjoy AYCE sushi at times!  No one had any complaints about the food.  However, we were a party of 5 and the servers were constantly forgetting things we ordered, would take forever to refill water (and we were asking, not assuming they saw our empty cups) and would be quite rude whenever asked a question.  Sadly, good times at Maki seem to be out the door :( we wont be returning."}
{"text":"From my favorite Sushi place to not worth it at all!"}
{"text":"About 3 years ago, when they just opened up they won the neighborhood over by offering good quality sushi for a very decent price, but few years later after they have opened a Chinese restaurant next door (yes it is by the same owner) and part of the management team switched over, things started sliding down. The service deteriorated fist, but food caught up with it over some time. It happened a lot when our orders were not prepared and other people's orders got delivered to our table. The waiters mostly look like they are doing you a huge favor by pouring some tea after the 100's request. Food used to be alright for the AUCE* place, now it averaged to the lower end of the all-you-can-eat spectrum. There actually is a difference between dishes made for AUCE customers and for a la cart. In the latest you get a little bit more fish and it is executed somewhat more accurate. The last few times I have noticed that the fish is no longer the freshest and I can only imagine what goes into their  maki and temaki. One of our friends actually complained once about having a food poisoning after going to dinner. So, why 2 stars then? First, I still can navigate my way around the menu and compose a decent order(though mostly for take out these days) and second, they are still rather on a cheap side, given my appetite I manage to fit into 20-25$ bill for 2.  Also the decor is interesting though it starts to show some wear the tear and  yes, they do deliver around Thornhill.   Anyway, if you are used to eating sushi at the mall kiosks and other AUCEs this place is ok with lunch at 12.99(till 4:30) and dinner at 18.99, but if you know better my advise would be to go somewhere else.  *AUCE = all you can eat"}
{"text":"FOOD:  PRO: I love the volcano roll, eel sushi, salmon belly and their other rolls which I forgot the names already probably because they're too many to mention.   PRICE:  CON: Their All You Can Eat is good but I think too pricey.  AMBIANCE:   PRO: They have nice big couches and tables, good design inside and out. The vibe feels sophisticated, not casual.   RECOMMENDATION:  Make sure to order their Volcano Roll."}
{"text":"Dined here with my bf once a few days ago. The food was average, sashimi was fresh. Wait time with certain foods on the menu was long. Opens until late, but service was pretty bad to me. Waiters were kind of rude. The price for AYCE dinner is $$$, but then again it is a high demand location. I recommend this place.. Give it a try."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurant in the Toronto. Food very tasty and all what they cook definitely from the very fresh ingredients. Sashimi were extremely amazing. They serve crab legs, which were real big! 100% coming back! And recommend this restaurant to my friends!"}
{"text":"This place has changed new owner and it's really really shitty.  They don't have anymore king crab legs like how they used to but still advertising as they still do and when u went there the waitress don't even bother inform u there's no king crab legs. Their sashimi aren't even fresh and smell fishy. I was really pissed off and walked away and would never recommend anyone come here at all."}
{"text":"I knew straight away something was off about this place when I was met with strange unpleasant fumes coming out of the kitchen. I found the sanitation and overall appearance of this place to be generally poor. The walls were stained with glossy lipid residues. I saw an older lady in a dirty apron carrying a cleaning solution from the washroom to the kitchen.   The sushi itself was bad, even for AYCE standards. The rice was dry, the fish, particularly the mackerel, was too rubbery. Most items were lacking in freshness.  Even the wasabi had a dry cracked surface. For all these reasons, I think $18 per person is hardly worth it.   The service was definitely the silverlining. I have not seen better service at any AYCEs."}
{"text":"Good food, only complaint is this rude waitress. Very disrespectful to her customers. She even took a photo of me without my permission, which I gladly smiled for. Other then her, this place is great and I come often."}
{"text":"I've been here before when it first opened but I have to admit I've come back due to the Groupon many years later.I was able to use the groupon the day I bought it which was great.   When I got there, I was so confused that there were two Maki Sushi. One was teppanyaki and the other one (that I've been to before) is the regular Maki sushi.   Looking at my groupon, I checked which restaurant it applied to and alas it was the teppanyaki one (which is probably why the groupon was cheap; two teppanyaki all you can eat dinners for 29.)  The all you can eat teppanyaki menu obviously featured less than its all you can eat menu however it was still satisfying.  A tip is to order a lot of the teppanyaki items at once because the chefs go to the kitchen and get your raw items, cooks for you and repeats the process for everyone at the table. To avoid waiting for the chef to cook other people's food, order sushi or a lot of teppanyaki at once. The desserts and salads are available in the refrigerated area however there are more to choose from the menu as well.  From my other teppanyaki experiences, these chefs didn't do much of a \"show\" to entertain customers.   I would say it's a great price with the groupon and I have purchased more to come back but on its own, it's quite pricey. In the end we only had to pay 2.50 extra for tip which is fantastic!   For those who have the groupon, the subtotal of the meal for two is $49.98, HST is $6.50, gratuity is 10% at $5.00 so total is $61.48. With $29 groupon being a value of $58.98, you only pay $2.50. I ended up paying more tip because I really found great worth in the deal was it was enjoyable talking with others at the teppanyaki table!  **update 08/18/13 Pricing breakdown has changed since my review and now every groupon you have to pay an extra $9.60. They would not explain to me how it has changed."}
{"text":"I'm a regular who orders a la carte not all-you-can-eat. Prices are good and staff knows to bring extra ginger and tea often.  Thanks.  Greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is very cheap (no sashimi) but you have a lot options!  The food came shortly after we ordered. Not perfect, but for the price I paid, I was pretty satisfied. The grilled teriyaki salmon is really good with a fair amount. Crispy salmon rolls are very good, too! The service is nice. We went there during lunch time and it's very fast and the waitresses were friendly, too. The cons: you need to remember what you order, because your order will come together with others on the table."}
{"text":"It's hard to say no when your friends are adamant about getting you to try Maki. I was immediately greeted upon entering, and quickly seated. Our server seemed to personally know the people I was dining with, which was pleasant. My partner got a bubbletea (which isn't great in my opinion, their tapioca sticks to one another and in general is not well made). We were given water and menus. I opted for the BBQ Beef Ribs Box for $16.99 in the Maki Bento Box section of the menu. Our food arrived promptly and I enjoyed my ribs. It was a very filling dish, as it comes with a california roll (6 pieces) as well. All the carbs!!! Overall, I got a family restaurant feel at this establishment, which created a nice dining experience. The server was attentive, friendly, and quick to answer any requests that we had. After our meal, our server got us all ice cream and the menu. It's a bit out of my way, but if my friends said to come have dinner at Maki, I wouldn't object."}
