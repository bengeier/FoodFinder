{"text":"B&M makes the best Polish Boy in Cleveland. ThIs location isn't as good as some of the others, but is still pretty good. Great chicken wings, ribs and fries."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, I personally like the wings the best, but you can't really go wrong.  Just a really solid BBQ joint, will be back often!"}
{"text":"Great food and great people! I'm big on customer service and they have it together! I ordered a wing snack, polish boy, ribs w fries and the butter pecan cake!  Everything was HOT and Delicious. I love the sauce but not too much where it makes your food soggy. It was just right. YESS quality BBQ. Def will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We love BBQ and always try out new places. At the suggestion of a friend we wanted to get their wings. The wing dinner is amazing here as are all things. The wings were so big and plump and perfect sauced. If you like the hot, suggest you get those. My kids loved the ribs and fries as well. It's really great and if you cannot make it to the south, this is your next bet."}
{"text":"There breakfast is over priced and the portions for a breakfast is to be desire. I'll continue to pay less and drive to Harvard inn on 71st."}
{"text":"Okay, this is going to sound funny; I'm giving a review to a restaurant that I've never actually BEEN to.  But let me explain...no, let me sum up.  My Wife and I have had B and M's barbeque at Wade Oval Wednesday's a really great party in University Circle. They've had a booth there several times, and we've ALWAYS gotten their food. Their pulled pork nachos are AMAZING, and their sandwiches are great.   So, here's an unbiased opinion just about the food; it's amazing and the people there are really nice.  So, no matter what location you stop at, STOP, trust me:)  (BTW, for ambiance, could we have the category \"out in the park-ey\"?"}
{"text":"You know you have arrived at a crappy restaurant when you walk in the door and the employees are literally rolling a blunt in front of you."}
{"text":"I must say I'm shocked this is the first time I've ate in here since they reopened a year ago ! Very good service and the food excellent! I had the short rib dinner with cole slaw and fries with sauce on the fries . My wife kids had the 5 piece whole wing dinners with cole slaw and fries great crunchy chicken even with sauce on it ! I have to say the sauce is so good I sopped it up with the bread you get two slices with your dinner. They have a cool lobby rustic just like a bbque spot should be . I will be back , usually I have to drive to the East side to St. Clair for some Bbque . I've ate other B and M locations and they were no where as good as this Bellaire rd location. I will definitely be back Kudos for the great food"}
