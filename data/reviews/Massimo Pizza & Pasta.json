{"text":"Massimo's makes some truly excellent pizza, although they also make Italian sandwiches (meatball, veal, that sort of thing) too.  Growing up, I used to come here for lunch on a regular basis, and it was years before I could finish an entire slice of Massimo's pizza. For extra torture, I used to get the \"arrabiata\" slice, which is simply the delicious, pesto-based \"marguerita\" with jalapeno peppers, and completely destroy by ability to eat for the rest of the afternoon.  These days, I wimp out and avoid the peppers, but at least I can finish the whole slice. I don't come as often anymore, but every time I do, I hear about it from the old guys: \"Hey! Why don't you come in anymore?!\" That's the personal touch."}
{"text":"There really is no better pizza than this.  Don't even think of those fufu places like Terroni.  Massimo's is really better than all the rest.  Born and raised in Toronto, I know what is good and what is not in the city.  Massimo's is the best margherita pizza and the best calzone.    They don't own the best title for their veal or pasta (anymore, their chef Chicio left and opened his own shop on Dundas west south of Little Italy and he makes very good pasta)."}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent.  The best in the area.  Pros: very tasty pizza Cons: Hours could be better, pizza is sometimes not as hot as it could be (it can't always be \"straight from the oven\", but sometimes I have gotten a lukewarm -- though still delish! -- slice)"}
{"text":"This is bar none my favourite pizza place of anywhere i travel.  They have three main slices: Margherita (with garlic sauce and basil), Pepperoni, and Supreme (notable that it doesn't have mushrooms! Yes!).  Other stuff on the menu is OK, but the pizza is what I go there for. The most important part is to cover your slice with the garlic/parsley/basil oil that is on top of the counter there... The crust is variable in thickness - but always tasty."}
{"text":"At $3.75 for a large slice, topped with your personalized amount of greasy garlic and saucy green stuff, the \"margueritta\" is a local favorite, nurturing many local hippies.  You can get the hot pepper version for the same price.  They only sell three types of pizzas but are very popular and fast.  People do sports betting in there.  Open until 2am."}
{"text":"Say it ain't so Massimo's!  Say it ain't so!  I don't know what's going on, but whoever is running the place needs to get their act together.  I don't like to see conditional pass signs on the doors of my fave food places.  Especially so many within such a short period of time.  You're supposed to fail once, learn your lesson, and make sure it never happens again.  Conditional Pass (Toronto Public Health) June 12, 2007 Sept 23, 2008 Jan 8, 2009  And then...Closed by Toronto Public Health- Feb 27, 2009!!! The one condition for closure I can't ignore? \"-Operator fail to prevent a rodent infestation\"  Ewwww.  I haven't been able to order pizza from Massimo's since.  I just can't do it.  It's been 2 months now, and I still can't do it.  I'm so upset.  Can someone who knows how to run a clean and safe establishment please buy this place up and FIX IT so I can have my pizza back pls????

{"text":"One of the first orders of business upon moving into the city many years ago: find a new, beloved pizza hotspot to nurture our late-night (and all day) cravings. After not too long, it was Massimo's that fell into my house's collective lap through word of mouth and...pretty much just word of mouth.   The pizza is great, with fairly sized, oil and basil-brushed (after it comes our of the oven- a delicious touch) slices that seem worth the 4$ or so charged. The interior has had some work done since these old days I speak of, seeming more like a sit-down restaurant, seeming like the kind of place in which I might actually order pasta-- something I had never even considered til the I tried my dining companion's Gorgonzola Gnocci. Thus began a dangerous obsession.  The pasta really is fantastic, and I know I have enjoyed at least one or two veal sandwiches there in my day. The pizza, as I said, is also no less than delicious when purchased in slices at the counter, but I must add that this translated less-than-perfectly into a couple of deliveries, which I felt were slightly pricey for my degree of satisfaction.          That being said, I embrace any opportunity to run there for my (way-too-short-to-do-it-often) lunch-break when I am working down the street."}
{"text":"Massimo's is a great place for late night pizza if you're anywhere in the strip on College from Spadina to Bathurst. I remember a couple nights spent dancing at Rancho Relaxo where all I had to do to grab food was go next door to get a huge slice of pizza for super cheap, and in the summer I could sit on the bench outside and people watch before heading home.  It's not open as late as, say, Sneaky Dee's, but it's the best pizza on the strip and sometimes you just need a slice of greasy pizza covered in cheese to end the night."}
