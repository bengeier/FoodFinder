{"text":"Made another visit.  This time, I just wanted to try their dinner special, which is a choice of items from their buffet (1 curry plus rice for about $7, 2 items plus daal, rice and naan about $10).  I enjoyed my meal and thought it reasonable value. In all, I thought their buffet food to be good, with strong depth of flavour, but not exceptional.  Hence, I'm going to stay with 5 stars, but I'd apply that rating only to meals made fresh to order. Especially that Chicken Karahi and their pakoras..."}
{"text":"I went to this place a few times when it was called Debu's. It still looks the same (minus the Debu's sign), but it's changed. No more friendly owner, the food is ten times worse and more expensive, the restaurant is dirtier. When I ate at Debu's the food was light, tasty, and felt quite healthy (I felt great after I ate it).   I ate dinner here tonight with a friend at this place about 5 hours ago and my stomach still hurts. My friend's stomach started to hurt 30 minutes after we ate, and we both have been feeling terrible the rest of the evening. I've had bouts of nausea ever since, with an upset stomach that started 45 min after I ate. The food was alright, but cost way too much, was too oily, and what hasn't already vacated my intestines is sitting in my stomach like a brick. Nauseated is not the way I wanted to spend New Years' Eve.   I will NOT be returning. I wouldn't go here again if it was the only restaurant open at the end of the universe. I paid $10 for a stomach ache that still isn't going away. Seriously, I feel 10x worse than I did when I used to eat at McDonald's!  Learn from my mistake! Avoid a belly ache!"}
{"text":"I live nearby. They have indoor and outdoor seating, they take credit and debit cards. In terms of the food, if it's hot it's quite good, if it's cold, it's not the best. I pretty much go here when I miss home and want decent Indian food.  I have had some packaging issues from getting food here in that the sauce either spilled in the bag or on my jacket in my mad rush home and I didn't notice until it was far too late, so take caution.  Make sure you get charged the correct amount, as they did make a mistake on pricing one time and overcharged me, but I was too cold, too angry at myself for being spilly, and too hungry to go back to get my $3.  TLDR: Pricing is reasonable, food is good when hot, owner is quite nice, be careful of packaging and aware of correct amount charged."}
{"text":"Definitely avoid this place.   I just picked up lunch and the curries looked so runny I think they water them down. the chicken in my dish didn't look well cooked and given the sauce was so runny, i was affraid to eat it.  I love Indian food, and have had from all types of Indian restaurants, but this was the worst I've seen in terms of food quality. I literally had to throw out my lunch."}
{"text":"I live near kensington market and visit this restaurant and waterfalls quite often since they are the two best restaurants for indian food imo.  The food is absolutely awesome and affordable.  I personally recommend the sheesh kebab and chicken korma.  As far as I can recall there isn't a seating area so take out is the better option.  Hope this helps."}
{"text":"i had a hankering for chicken biriyani. i should have known when i saw it on the special menu. i ordered it, and then heard the dreaded microwave door open as the owner (?) went back to heat up a frozen carton of my food. It was not fresh, did not taste good at all. Chicken was dry and gross. three smallish pieces, and the rice was pretty flavorless.  I also ordered Raita (thick yogurt -cucumber side sauce) to accompany my dish. it was separated and the consistency of water. looks like skim milk, i don't know what kind of food this is. will not return. couldn't finish it, threw out the food. if they can't do a traditional indian dish correctly, i am frightened to think that their more unique dishes taste like (butten chicken poutine)."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have been to cleaner nicer places while traveling through India and places I trusted the food more as well. I will be amazed if I don't get Dheli Belly from this place.  The food was just horrible and really not worth trying, I recommend you not waste your time and try any of the other good restaurants that Kensington has to offer."}
