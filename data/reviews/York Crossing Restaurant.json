{"text":"First time here. Everything was excellent. Eva made me feel welcomed and was very warm, friendly, and had an uplifting attitude. She answered all of my questions and made suggestions. I would return just for that level of customer service. But the food was delicious! Flounder Special, Super Cheeseburger Special, Ribeye sandwich (all with sides), hotdog, a bowl of pintos, and a fountain Cherry soda to go. The whole family ate like little piggies and all had left-overs! Portions given are plentiful and fresh. Prices are surprisingly reasonable. Clean (sanitation grade 95). Popular eatery but did not wait long at all. They also have a call ahead Drive-thru. Dailey specials. Open Mon-Thurs from 6am-8pm, Fri 6am-9pm. Breakfast served from 6am-10am.  Only cons: no desserts this evening                     not open on weekends We will be back!"}
{"text":"My coworkers introduced me to this place for lunch a long time ago. It's tucked into a shopping center behind the new Steele Creek Police Department  and I wouldn't have known it was there. It's a simple no frills restaurant with excellent home style American cuisine. I don't bother with McDonald's or Burger King anymore, I am spoiled by the burgers here and I love the flounder plate as well, and if you want a good breakfast it's also a great place for that. There always seems to be something good on the specials menu, and the staff is very friendly It's a no frills look, but the place is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is fantastic. I love this restaurant.   My only complaint is that they aren't open on Sunday."}
{"text":"I promise, this little hole in the wall place with some mildly uptight service just served me the best hamburgers ive ever had"}
{"text":"Breakfast is amazing and the prices are even better. Flounder and croaker dinners are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! Love this place. Staff is friendly and fast. If you are in a rush however, I would recommend calling in your order at least 20 minutes ahead as they stay busy."}
{"text":"Well, for years I've heard term \" if you want to eat some good food eat where truckers eat\". Not far from me is a such place have noticed for years that they get a lot of traffic in this restaurant,: so I decided to give it a try. They have a modest down home decor put a warm friendly atmosphere. Hey I understand why the truckers and many others stop in here daily too, food is down home good."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to my husband we gave it a try on Monday. They seems to have numerous daily specials as well as your everyday grill/burger/deli selections. Price is certainly reasonable especially compared to portion size. It's a decent sized place and was busy-busy around 1PM. Service was great I can think of a few places that could take a page from their customer service book, for sure!!! Being our first visit we---as in I the picky one of us was a tad overwhelmed with the choices. That always makes me feel a lil rushed especially at peak times, zero need to worry, the lady who took our order couldn't have been any nicer. This is certainly a place to try!!"}
{"text":"This little place was recommended by a realtor friend of mine as a inexpensive nice spot to get a good breakfast. Not everything has to be a five star dining experience, right. Well, I can say that you get a big cup of coffee and that's about it. The menu is a bit confusing by having two specials named the exact same thing and not being the same. Also the food isn't very warm and the as kind of disappointing. Maybe lunches are better but the breakfasts miss the mark."}
{"text":"Ate here recently for the first time. It was... okay. I got chicken tenders and fries to go. The food was still hot when I got to my destination so that was a plus. The tenders taste okay, kind of like tenders you get from a seafood place. The fries had no seasoning and were a little hard . I'd try this place again only because it's close to my job."}
{"text":"The York Crossing Restaurant is just good food without pretension.  It seems that almost every new breakfast restaurant has to be something (our eggs are the freest range of free range from chickens that are named after the members of Destiny's Child) in order to justify charging $15 for an omelet.  The York Crossing Restaurant is none of that, and that's what makes it so great.  This is a no-frills restaurant with counter order service, homestyle meals and great prices.  Two people can get breakfast at this place for around $10.  That's incredible when you think it's nearly 2017.    I had the ham biscuit, pancakes, eggs, and home fries.  The home fries were amazing but so was everything else.  I could definitely see being a regular here.    This diner is only open during the week so don't make any place to brunch here before hitting your Sunday Funday activities.  However, for a great breakfast without the hype, definitely check out the York Crossing."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and the service was even worse. Ordered an egg sandwich and hash browns at 9:50 am and finally got my food at 10:20 on soggy toast and undercooked hash browns...#neveragain"}
{"text":"It's clean, fast and fresh! I popped in to pick up breakfast before work. I was able to place my order immediately...I beat the crowd. I was greeted  with a smile."}
{"text":"This place has a down home spin on things. From the Super C double cheeseburger to awesome fish plates, you won't be disappointed!!"}
