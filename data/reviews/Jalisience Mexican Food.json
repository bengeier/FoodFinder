{"text":"Just had a chance to try this new spot and it definitely was not what I was expecting. We ordered some street tacos, soft tacos, taquitos and a cheese burger. The street tacos were really oily like if it was fried, the soft tacos was soggy and fell apart when trying to pick them up, the cheese burger had one huge blob of mayo right in the center and the meat tasted low quality the fries that came with it were dark as if the oil wasn't changed. Finally the taquitos were the only things edible but still just ok, nothing great."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, excellent service! Had the shrimp ceviche and shrimp-stuffed chiles - both were spectacular! Chips and salsa are some of the best I've ever had. Don't miss this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"They are now inside AZ International Marketplace.  The food is great!  The pricing is exceptionally reasonable.  Great street tacos."}
{"text":"So after moving from SoCal 2 years ago, I had given up on finding an authentic Mexican restaurant.  Well, I found it in Gilbert. Food was supreme, menu is extensive and the service was fantastic. You've got to try this place. Support your local business. I've already been twice in two days."}
{"text":"It's very hard to find good Mexican food in Gilbert. So I was very excited to find this place! It's very clean, great music, has tv's for games, and the staff is awesome. The food was great! And the margarita was amazing as well! Definitely gonna be my \"Go-To\" spot for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"We have been in twice since it opened and love it! Lots of variety on the menu. Food is delicious and the prices are great for what you get. Excited about this place being so close to my house and the customer service is awesome."}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos were awesome!!! Great little place!"}
{"text":"The Shrimp Cocktail is beyond yummy, the Carne Asada Plate big enough for 2 and the street tacos are the best! Even the Iced Tea is good.  We haven't have good Mexican food in some time, this place blew us away.  Perfecto!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little \"Mami and Papi\" restaurant: good food, good prices, cheap beer, casual environment. The decor is not fancy, but I don't eat decor. ;) They have Latino soap operas, a soccer game, or talent show playing on the TV. The service can be a tad slow if the man is waiting on you, but the woman is great.  Today, I had the Enchiladas Suiza combination plate, which was yummy. The green sauce was so creamy and delicately savory, and the frijoles were creamy and tasty. My boyfriend's Chicken Chimichanga was fried perfectly and filled with meat. The $1.99 Pacificos (during happy hour) made it even more enjoyable.  Oh! The salsa! Nice heat, a bit thin, but still has bits of cilantro, tomatoes, and onions. Yummy.  Definitely good for families. Fast service. Plenty of parking. Near the freeways.  UPDATE:  We've dined here several times, and the food is always good. Just a note, though: The music from the jukebox or the volume on the TV can be VERY loud. So loud that you can't hear someone speaking to you who is 8\" away from you. It's really weird, because it's not like it's a bar."}
{"text":"This place is a great find! Food is very flavorful! I would've given it 5 stars if they didnt charge extra for more salsa and chips, NO mexican restaurant should ever  charge extra for that! Otherwise loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I had the shrimp burrito enchilada style with green sauce and it was amazing!  This place is a breathe of fresh air for the area!!  Carne asada, chicken, shredded beef, various shrimp and fish dishes.  All fresh and great prices!  Support this local business and I guarantee you will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Brought my family here when they first opened. We got street tacos, carne asada burritos, and ceviche. Over all the food was good. My husband loves seafood and enjoyed the cocktail Cameron. I like how the carne asada burrito did not have fillers like rice and beans like other places. My boys liked the spicy salsa. We will be back"}
{"text":"Yum, went around 10:30 and was graciously greeted. Only 3 other parties in the restaurant so we received plenty of attention. Started off with water and the chips and salads came out with it. Mmmm little too hot for the wife but I like it hit. We then Ordered and I got a shrimp cocktail and micheleda. Generous with both the shrimp and the drink! Wife orders the carne asade tacos. We can't wait to come back and try something new. Great new gem!???"}
{"text":"We found out about this restaurant when driving by it. The best burrito I have eaten in a long time. I like the tortilla very crispy, they fix  it as I like, very crispy without it falling apart. Myusband had a shrimp tostada, he liked it also. Very good food and the staff very friendly and accommodating. We definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend absolutely got me hooked on the shrimp tacos! Hope you can enjoy too!"}
{"text":"My favorite place has moved from their original location to the newly built international market on Broadway and Dobson. The location changed but the not the quality of the food or the friendliness of the staff.."}
{"text":"This place is a must have!  We stopped in for dinner.  Customer service was great.  We were greeted right away and got our drink order in. I completely forgot to take pictures of all of our food.  There were 4 adults and 2 kids. We have sopes, crunch tacos, carne asada torta ( was excellent!!!)  Shrimp burrito and everything was great.  We will be back and I will try other items on the menu, they have a very good variety!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food! Love their spicier salsa - ask for it. All homemade food and very reasonably priced. Taco Tuesday is even cheaper for great carne asada street tacos. Friendly service for dining in or you can call in for take out. If you are in Gilbert you should try and support this small business, it has quickly become one of our family's favorite!"}
{"text":"Went to try this new place and it was great, we tried their shrimp cocktail and tacos and they were very tasty. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"My husband went here to order out and the employees acted like they didn't know how to handle that. On the menu you can choose two or three rolled chicken tacos, he asked for 5 and the employee had to go check if that was okay...? Wtf..? He ordered me a chicken burrito and himself a breakfast burrito. The first bite I took I found a chicken bone.. Thought that must have just been a fluke but I found 5 more bones in my burrito...5!!! The chicken tasted old and bland, eventually I had to pull the chicken out of my burrito and just eat the beans and rice. My husband said the breakfast burrito was just mediocre, not what we expected from this place. On top of that the wait was about 25 minutes and the prices are not that great."}
{"text":"The service was fast, and my husband loved his burrito, but the tacos and enchiladas were bland. The salsa was almost unbearably spicy. Looks like they have a lot of seafood entrees so maybe that's their specialty."}
{"text":"Been there a few times and the and service is family friendly. Seafood cocktails, carnitas and they serve beer and mixed drinks. Going to get the oysters next time."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a bean burrito to go for lunch. I loved it! Their red and green sauce is awesome. Not runny like most other fast food Mexican places. Definitely going back to try the ceviche. They also have Micheladas!"}
{"text":"What a gem to find! Great food and margaritas! The staff is so friendly and the best Mexican food I've had in a long time! Born and raised in Tucson that says something!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food. The vegetarian burrito was tasty and so were the chips and salsa. A great place to celebrate Cinco de Mayo."}
{"text":"OMG!  The worst!  I ordered a crispy taco.  It came and was a tortilla that had been dunked in an odd color oil.  No crispness and no way was I going to attempt picking up the sponge of off color grease. Hubby bean burrito was not eatable Every table in the place was dirty. She never came back to check on us!   Now at In and Out having lunch after paying for and not eating the first one."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The service has been slow. There were only two other tables.  It took 30 minutes to get lousy iced tea that tasted very old. When I asked her for water because the tea tasted bad, she suggested we sweeten the tea instead of just bringing us what we asked for. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and the service was friendly. I had the bean and cheese burrito and my husband had green Chile burrito. They're both so good!! I also loved the taco Birria. The only problem is their phone doesn't work! Please fix this for future! I would hate to see this place go out of business because people can't reach them!"}
{"text":"We stopped for the first time this evening and found the food was the absolute best of anywhere we have eaten in the Phoenix metro area.  It takes time for your order to be made but the wait is worth it since all food is made to order. This is not some fast food place where food is precooked. Nor is it a restaurant where some of the more common foods are held for hours in a steam table.   The wait is worth it.   Salsa was outstanding. Chips were great. Service was good. What more is there to like. We liked it all."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I ordered a Carne Asada plate and my fianc√© ordered a Mojara. We are definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Very good neighborhood spot. The salsa is NOT too spicy. This is a Mexican restaurant in the southwest, it's just right, served with chips that hold up. My husband is a green chili sauce fan and this was towards the top of his list. There were two types of tacos on the menu, I had one of each, both were good. Service was fast and attentive. We will return."}
{"text":"Overall, great food and service. Family ordered breakfast burritos and were more than satisfied with taste. I ordered menudo. You can it was home style with a good balance of tripe to hominy and broth was rich. A tell tale sign the Jalisience know what they were doing is when I saw the cotija cheese on the beans. Sooooo good. All good here for the real deal"}
{"text":"Best ceviche ever, I usually travel to phx for good seafood..... glad I found this place that's close to home !"}
{"text":"I tried this place while shopping in the International Market and it is good, but not great. The food itself is pretty decent, but it takes SO long. I ordered elote once, and there was no one else there, and it took 15 minutes to get. It's priced just about right but the food is not the best Mexican food I've had. The elote lacked flavor.   If you're shopping in the market, it's a nice place to stop, but I don't really see myself going out of the way to get food from here"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm so glad I found it, especially in Gilbert!! The tacos are as good as they can get, I recommend the al pastor! I finally found the best authentic Mexican food around town!"}
{"text":"Ceviche tastes fresh. I really liked it. Menudo just how nana used to make. Service was great. Quick. Very new and very clean. Usually have to go out of my way for authentic Mexican food but now it's right here in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat good Menudo. Theirs was great!! We will definitely revisit. The lady that brought the food out from the kitchen was awesome. She realized we had a 9 month old, and sat everything out of his reach and brought a small spoon for us to feed him...all without even having to ask her. She made it worth our drive from Queen Creek. I've already recommended it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break and oh my goodness! One of the most authentic restaurants here in Gilbert! The food tasted as if my nana was in the kitchen with them! Very very very good food! Highly suggest this place to everyone!  I will say this: the waitresses definitely need to be more properly trained. Saw many big waitress no-no's when it came to not greeting new tables, not bringing out the food properly, bringing out silverware without napkins. Those are basic waitress skills so they definitely need to be whipped into the proper shape to serve in a restaurant or that alone can cause the restaurant to do poorly."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you see everyday as you drive by. It's also one of those places that you kick yourself for not coming here sooner!  I ordered the Carne Asada burrito, which is my usual when I'm in a new place. It was good sized, I could tell it was going to fill me up. It had the meat, guacamole, beans and Pico de gallo. It is unusual that it came with beans inside, but the were really good so i didnt mind. But it made it a little light on thr meat. Again, i didnt mind because it was reall good. I asked for the Pico on the side. They brought green and red salsa with the burro (different from the one with the chips) I liked the green alot but not the red, I liked the chips' salsa better. The cook himself brought my plate out which was cool. But was a little put off when I asked for more chips and salsa. The server brought them. She was really nice, and the cook was probably just busy... Once I started to eat the burrito I only put it down once before I finished it, it was that good lol. The tea had a funny taste I drank my water instead. The have pepsi products  (dislike).  I'll be back, and if you haven't been here you should definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place across my kids' dentist (Super cool place too, btw). Definitely check it out. I will be back for sure. I had the grilled fish and really liked it."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. I had the Chile Relleno Happy Hour special and my wife had the fish taco. Very good flavor and priced right!  We'll be back for sure, and be sure to check out those happy hour specials!!  Went back a few weeks later and were disappointed in that we were told every was made in the morning and if we wanted something without cilantro we would be limited on what we choose.  That was a change from our first visit and not a positive for us.  Maybe we'll be back."}
{"text":"Had green Chile's wrapped in bacon, with cream cheese and shrimp.  Never had anything like this. It was really good. 4 green Chile's could feed 2 people.  Everything made fresh, took some time but worth it.  My wife had the street taco, meat was amazing."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and the food was very good but the service was horrible and will likely prevent me from going back. I had the spicy fish fillet and my friend had the spicy shrimp. Both were very spicy but very flavorful.         There were only 2 other tables there but the server chose to basically ignore us and talk and flirt with a group of three young men who seemed to only be watching the World Cup. I had to ask for a refill of my drink but the other two tables got refills of chips and salsa. We basically sat there waiting to be acknowledged.      When spending $23 a piece for lunch I expect some attempt at service.  There was no excuse given the lack of a crowd to have this poor of service."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever! Shrimp cocktail is authentically amazing, with amazing service!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst mexican food I have ever had. The bacon in my burrito was raw for starters. There carne asada with more like dog food. The smothered chimichanga I ordered had no sauce what so ever and the side of sour cream was spoiled smelt like it had been sitting out on the counter for a week. This place need the health inspector called on them"}
{"text":"I am so excited and thankful that Jalisience is open and right around the corner! My husband surprised me with some tacos and a burrito from this location and It was amazing!   Warning, we love to eat, so we ordered: two street tacos (adobada and pastor), bean/cheese burrito, special birria tacos and a carne asada burrito! Told you, we like our food! I tried everything but the carne asada burrito and that was because my husband finished it so quickly and forgot to give me a bite! The tacos were all delicious I could have eaten more! They are generous with their protein and have a lot of great flavor. I also enjoyed the surprise and food so much I forgot to take a photo too! This should indicate how delicious it was.  Overall, I'm so excited and I want everyone to try this place! I already can't wait to go back! Next time I will try to be strong and take some photos before I chow down!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, food was great, staff is nice and the place is clean. Hidden gem. I will definitely be coming back for happy hour and to try new dishes."}
{"text":"It's a definite \"yes\" for me...I'll be back for sure!  Great food, friendly service and no wait (although, I'd wait if I had to).  Clean but simple.  Don't let the atmosphere of a small restaurant in an strip mall discourage you.  Salsa was amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for the first time - the shrimp ceviche was awesome and the portion size was huge! Hubby loved his burrito and the beer was ice cold. The service was excellent, we will definitely go back!!"}
