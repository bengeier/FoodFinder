{"text":"Good meal. Lots of fun. Nice staff. Loved the duck and calamari.  Also the seafood potato dish."}
{"text":"Its a surprise to me that this resto was rated at 2.5 stars. We had a great experience there tonight. Tuna was mid blowing, fresh, unexpected and delicious! I also took the ravioli- they were done in a very different way, see the photos- they were placed on top on basil pesto with fresh tomatoes and olives and almonds and topped off with parmesan. They also have pimms there!! Loved it! The atmosphere is very chill and the service was great."}
{"text":"Great food! Very fresh. The cocktails are amazing and the staff is very nice. Will definetly go back more than once :-)"}
{"text":"Food was great - courgette and tuna starters were delicious (although small) - as were the ravioli and fletan....the main problem was the service! The waitresses were actually cleaning the empty tables around us before clearing our plates. They seemed to have forgotten about us, which was odd given that the restaurant was near empty. I suspect the staff are just inexperienced - would do the resto good if they invested in the waitstaff."}
{"text":"We had a great meal...  from the drinks at the beginning, the appetizer, the main course, dessert. Every dish that the four of us had was superb. We started with some cocktails. There was quite a list and difficult to choose. But we settled on Ke Germaine which was great. My wife!s appetizer was a grilled octopus which she loved and I had the mushroom puff pastry. For the main course my wife had the tagliatelle and I had the braised beef. Both dishes were excellent and the portions were very large. I had no room for dessert but my wife had the cheesecake and our friends had the puffed pastry which was unbelievable. All in all a great meal. Recommended for everyone."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few weeks ago and was blown away. Despite the negative reviews going around, I was intrigued by the menu had to try it out and see for myself. 

To start off, the service was excellent. The guy who seated us and our waiter were both friendly, polite and helpful. We ordered two different cocktails and both were great and very generously sized. Wine list was interesting and they also serve beer.

I had albacore tuna as an entrée and it was fresh and delicious. Portion was a little small but then again that could be said about most of the plates I saw being served around me. I had the scallops as my main dish and it's what really blew me away - one of the best meals I have ever had! The plate was a piece of art. Each little dab of sauce, veggie and scallop was meticulously laid out. Each different element tasted fantastic and was simply delicious as a whole. Hands down one of the best main dishes I've had the pleasure of enjoying in Montreal. 

The deserts were OK but nothing out of this world. Overall a great experience and meal - worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This place was only good for the 10 oysters.

Everything else was terrible.
$23 for 5 cold crappy ravioli.


The chicken was flavourless crappy and bloody as can be.

The fish and chips were greasy and .
The fries were okay 
The coleslaw tasted like fennel."}
{"text":"The food was excellent however the service was atrocious. We went on a Saturday during \"Montréal à table\" last November. It was the \"waiter's\" first day working at the restaurant and he didn't let us forget this fact. It was obvious that he had no service experience. Whether he was there to just help out is possible but what a disaster. Secondly, it took over one hour to be served the main course. This was quite embarrassing as I had chosen the restaurant. Our friends were gracious with their patience but it was naturally wearing thin. One of my guests also craved a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon but such a wine or anything similar was not available. I would recommend the restaurant with the hope that the service and wait time we experienced is not a regular occurrence."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. Unless you have an hour to wait for oysters don't come here! We ended up leaving after the oysters because it took so long to get RAW food that we couldn't fathom wasting the entire night trying to get another drink and COOKED food. I ordered an old fashioned, thinking I would drink that then order a bottle of wine to share when the oysters arrived. The old fashion cocktail took them 20 minutes to make - and there was a lot of discussion back and forth about what goes in an old fashioned cocktail. An OLD FASHION - how could there even be any discussion?? My friend ordered a Corona to avoid any discussion. So 1 simple cocktail, and 1 beer and 24 oysters cost us WAY too much money and 2 hours of our lives we'll never get back... AVOID THIS PLACE! Satay Brothers is right across the street - opt for that!"}
{"text":"Visited Henri Staint-Henri for Oystermania. The 10 oysters and a drink for $10 was great. 

The atmosphere was a touch on the loud side, finding that special place where the music is just loud enough that people are shouting at each other. With closely placed tables and music loud enough to necessitate shouting, but not loud enough to drowned out conversation, you will find yourself a willing or unwilling participant in all nearby conversations. 

Beer selection was a bit on the weak side. The beer tartare and tuna gravlax were adequate with nice presentation. 

Service was rather tragic. Our two plates of rather small oysters  (whatever it was $10 no worries) took 50 minutes to an hour. The appetizers were another 40ish minutes. 

Nearly an hour on 20 oysters is rather impressive. 

With so many other great options in the area I think we're unlikely to be back to Henri Saint-Henri."}
