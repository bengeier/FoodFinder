{"text":"Service was TERRIBLE!  Told us we had to wait 35 minutes even though we had a reservation!!!  3 of 4 of us were there (ontime) and the 4th person was running late.  The hostess said they wouldn't sit us without the entire party so they cancelled the entire reservation and put us on a waiting list for 35 minutes.  The hostess was rude and didn't even tell the party that was there on time that this would happen.  Unacceptable and unbelievable!  Never has this happened to me at any restaurant ever..."}
{"text":"Smallest half chicken I've ever seen. It had no flavor. The cornbread was the best I've ever eaten, but with the price of the entrées, it should have been a free side dish and not an eight dollar extra. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I recently ate at Banderas with family members in for the Spring Season baseball games ( Go Giants). Bandera was as busy as any restaurant could be. Our waitress was excellent with so much going on. The chicken salad was the best I have ever had. It has an incredible light sweetness to it with their signature cornbread as croutons. The chicken flavor is very very good. We will return. All other entrees were equally enjoyed."}
{"text":"Excellent ,  my husband and I always eat here when we get a chance. I love the trout it's grilled to perfection and well seasoned . Would definitely recommend this place to anyone !"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant...   Service was fantastic, we got seated quickly and drinks were out in quick fashion and tasted great!  Food was delicious, I highly recommend the Dip Duo and Skillet Cornbread starters... they were fantastic.  As an entree, we ordered Prime Rib and the filet.... both cooked to perfection and delicious. Finally finished dinner with the House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches... oh my... I want more!  I can't remember our servers name, but she was great! Checked on us the right amount and took care of us, I never felt like we needed anything or were forgotten.  Definitely looking to visit again and try the Chicken!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and I loved the booth seating.  The mac & cheese and the cornbread are a must-get.  My prime rib was about a 7 on a 10 scale (a little dry), but everyone else at the table raved about their dinners and the rotisserie chicken was a 9+.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Bandera to me.  First, point in their favor - they take reservations.  We arrived on time and they seated us right away.  I had heard that their appetizer cornbread was not to be missed and so we ordered it to start.  Delicious in flavor and unique in presentation,  I loved the fact that the cornbread tasted like corn *emphasis-on-the-corn* bread and not corn flavored cake.  The green chilies were a fabulous compliment.  The prompt service and delivery of our food was the second point in their favor.  I ordered the roasted chicken and the barbeque beef rib with coleslaw and my dinner companion ordered the carnitas sandwich with braised pork and rio grande glaze with a side of the shoestring fries.  My chicken was moist and extremely flavorful - real flavorful, not the \"we-added-fake-smoke-flavoring-to-the-store-bought-barbeque-sauce-we-slopped-all-over-your-chicken\" flavor.  One of the three ribs on my plate was a little over done.  I'm all for cooking the ribs until the meat falls off the bone, but please stop when it starts to turn to charcoal.   The best part of the dinner was the coleslaw and that's saying something, because I hate coleslaw.  It was unlike any coleslaw I've ever tried.  It wasn't a mayo based coleslaw rather it was shredded cabbage with a touch of cilantro and what looked to be fresh spinach mixed with an oil based dressing that had a touch of chili powder.  It was then topped with crushed peanuts.  A savory and unique dish.  Bandera's food was deliciously memorable. Its service was prompt and thorough.  I'll be visiting Bandera's  again in the very near future."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in all of Arizona by far.  Any Hillstone restaurant for that matter should rank in the top restaurants of Arizona.  The service here is above a vast majority of restaurants in the area.  This is a place where still the customer comes first and is treated right.    The food is exceptional and the standards of quality are worth every penny. Even if this is what you would consider to be slightly out of your price range (ex. 13-15 dollar burger), save your money and don't go to some junk restaurant or drive through and only go here once.    After you try Bandera, drive up the road and try Houston's."}
{"text":"Outstanding food for a decent price.  You can get a good bottle of wine for $30 to $40.  Try doing that at Maestro's.   Lots of compliments from other Yelpers on the cornbread, but it's a little too heavy for my taste.  My favorite dishes are:  artichoke heart as an appetizer is unreal.  Best ribs I've ever had and I lived in Texas for 6 years.  Great filet.  Great prime rib dip sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food, but their take-out leaves you wanting more. They have cut the portions in half the last few times I've ordered pickup. Its frustrating if your trying to feed more than 1 person. 1 pint of a side will not fill up a cup (see photo). I wish they would just call it what it is so buyers know what they are getting. It feels like a slap in the face to a long time regular.  2 stars is because the food is so delicious."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, MUCH better than the Italian Grotto we just walked out of. Warning, the hamburger is HUGE and couldn't eat the whole thing."}
{"text":"The corn bread is amazing. It has a crunchy top and inside there are bits of jalapeno and sweetened corn kernels. It's almost dessert. I also had the carnitas sandwich, and it had a little too many things going on for my taste, but all the parts were delicious - I loved the glaze and the pork. My whole family loved the green rice - it's basmati rice cooked in coconut milk with minced basil, spinach, and cilantro mixed in."}
{"text":"Arrived (with no reservation) on a Saturday in March around 5.45pm. 20-minute wait, but the smell emanating from inside made us hopeful. First problem; no kids' menu. Panned corn bread was good. We ordered a variety if dishes; crispy chicken sandwich, roast chicken, chicken and ribs, pork sandwich. Service was fast and friendly. Food was good; in both quality and quantity. We were in and out in an hour, but dropped $180 for 2 adults and 3 kids ($150 plus tip). Three full doggie bags to take home, but still not worth ~$200. Probably best to avoid if you have kids but good for couples..."}
{"text":"Bandera is just a great standard and they always do well.  I have been there a few times in the last year and have never been disappointed.  The service is fantastic - and yes, sometimes you do have to wait for a table - but thats old town on a Saturday.  They have a fantastic basil martini that is always worth trying not to mention a great wine list.  I was there last weekend with my mom; she had the ribs - which literally were falling off the bone delcious and I had the meatloaf.  The meatloaf was running a little late and the chef came out to apologize.  Afterwards, he came back to see how it was and I told him I wanted the recipe.  He took 5 mins out of his BUSY shift to explain to me how to make it and I really appreciated that.  Also the fries are soo good!  Bandera - I love you."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Always get the flying chicken for take out!  Management is easy to work with and accommodate where they can. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you about their food because their reservation policy is so obnoxious and unfair that I won't go. They take reservations for parties of up to four. They have tables that seat larger parties but those are first come first served. They even refused to take the reservation with a credit card guaranteeing we would show up. I don't know what their problem is, but they can go broke without my money as far as I'm concerned. I'll go where I'm wanted."}
{"text":"The go-to place for very good steaks. Dark decor, elegant low lighting and top-notch service. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"It's like Lonestar or Outback or Applebees...only worse food, service and you get to pay double when it's all over.  A buddy called in to see if there was a wait. He decided to joke around with the guy who answered the phone by asking what the lady situation was like in the restaurant. \"It's mostly a white upper class restaurant,\" we heard in reply.   After a dozen or so minutes of soul searching (should we really go give these people our money?) we decided to check it out.  To our delight, we found that it was not overly white and not very \"upper class\". We were seated immediately - the only positive segment of our outing.  We had a young, shy waitress who was nice enough but didn't seem horribly interested in making our experience enjoyable. A buddy ordered a drink which came out quickly; about 10 minutes quicker than the waters the rest of us ordered.   About 15 minutes in, we get our waters and are asked if we would like some cornbread. Now, I don't frequent \"white upper class\" joints too often but i remember bread being offered for free at some of the finer establishments I've visited. Usually when an appetizer is being offered, the waitress says something like \"can I start you off with (Appetizer A) or maybe some (Appetizer B)\" not, \"Do you want me to bring some cornbread out?\" Thinking it was free, we confirmed that, yes, we would like some cornbread. The cornbread was the best of the food we ordered (knowingly or unknowingly), so, there's that.  Three of us ordered the rotisserie chicken and ribs. One buddy ordered the prime rib - he said it was decent. The chicken was mehh. The ribs were bad enough that once I saw them I wished I hadn't ordered them. Once I bit into them, I wished I hadn't tasted them. Once I finished them...you get the idea.  Decided to wash that nastiness down with some rye:  \"Ma'am, what rye whiskeys do you have?\"  \"Ehmmmm...excuse me?\"  \"Rye whiskey...do you have?\"  \"Let me ask the bartender...\"  (15 minutes later I catch her walking by.)  \"Ma'am, did you have a chance to check on the rye?\"  \"Oh, yeah...\" (makes the long trek to the bar [we're sitting right next to it])   At that point, I didn't really want the drink but because of the terrible service, I needed it.   Maybe this whole \"white upper class\" dining experience isn't for me."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant multiple times, and I've had good experiences but also bad. I love the cornbread, and the chicken is normally bomb, and every time I've tried to order the meatloaf it's been sold out. But last time I went both my friend and I had the chicken salad (her favorite) and it was fully of fat and cartilage chunks and both of us had hair in our meals."}
{"text":"I have never been so dissapointed with the service at a restaurant before. It was my friends birthday so we went to Bandera as it was suggested to us by the concierge at our hotel. We arrived at 8pm prompt which was the time we made reservations for. Appon arrival we were told it would be about 15 minutes and to have a seat at the bar and enjoy a drink. We had been drinking all day at the pool so opted not to have a drink at the bar. I scanned the room and saw at least 5 open tables. We waited about 10 minutes before being seated. We were greeted by our waitress who was very profesional but did not have much of a personality. Our food came in about 15 minutes and was good but was NOT worth the money we paid for it. We started with the Duo appetizer, which was delicious... the only good part of dinner. We had our food in front of us for about 5-10 minutes when the waitress came back and asked if we needed boxes. She did not ask if we were finished or if we needed more time but when we said we did not want a box our plates were taken immediately we didn't even have a chance to stop her. It was as if she was yanking our plates away telling us we were done instead of asking if we were finished. After that the appetizer was still on the table, so we started to munch on that a bit because they took our dinner away and then they came and took that despite us still enjoying it. The check was dropped and about 2 minutes after she returned our cards to us and we had signed our copies she took them all off the table. I have never been rushed out of a restaurant so quickly. We were seated at 8:10 and back to our hotel by 9pm. Not to mention we were still hungry after eating a $100 meal for 4 people because they did not allow us to finish. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Great food every time, ABOVE AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE and a perfect atmosphere - this is how i would describe this old town Scottsdale spot. I am here at least twice a month and have been going for years. This place is dialed in. Try the Mustard BBQ Beef Ribs with fancy mashed potatoes - perfection."}
{"text":"I was at Bandera on 2/21/14.  Fantastic food and even better service!  Management appears to oversee, review, and approve every item coming out of the kitchen.  Bandera does  not disappoint!  If you are going to Bandera on the weekend, be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation, but it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but my biggest issue was with the service. We made a reservation and still had to wait an hour. Isn't the whole point of a reservation...so you don't have to wait an hour? One of the three hostess, tried to help at the end of the wait but by then all we waited was to eat/drink. All in all, I enjoyed my chicken and bbq ribs but would not go back."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant for Spring Training! The food and service are always exceptional. I must give special props to our waitress this visit, Jenna, who is simply the best! She is exceptionally nice and very efficient, making our 2 visits memorable and superb. Kudos on a great job done by all the staff!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but now I have to knock their review down a bit. I mainly enjoyed the French Dip here, but sadly, they no longer serve it.  The last time we came here, they misplaced the reservation I made with them. After some cajoling, they got us in earlier than they originally stated. Dinner was pretty good, but it was not as good as I had remembered.  I'd say I would give it 3.5 stars. I wish Yelp did half stars!"}
{"text":"I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because I'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy. But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food.  Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two.  Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food."}
{"text":"Little pricey to go with kids but not too bad. Agree with most of the other reviews. Corn bread and artichoke apoetiser were delish. Ahi tuna was yummy as well as the chicken. My 9 year old got the French dip and only finished 1/4 of it. For 4 people with 2 drinks and 4 meals with 2 apps was $153.  Agree that things get cleared from your table way to quickly and you feel a little rush to eat and go. We ignored that fact and sat."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good.  The service is impeccable!  Order artichokes when available. Order chicken Caesar salad or the corn bread.  Whatever you order will be fantastic"}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in the area for about 4 years. We have tried places from north Scottsdale to Tempe and phoenix. HANDS DOWN the best food from appetizers to entrée was Bandara. The chicken was simply amazing. The ribs were fantastic. And do not skip the deviled egg appetizer!    Worth every cent. Leanne was our server and made our visit the best. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we had a really bad experience with their service...so bad in fact that we left before we were even seated. We put our name in for a party of 12 and were told an hour wait for two tables of 6. When the time came they told us that it would be 30 more minutes and would be three tables of 4, which wasn't a big deal until the hostess called us liars and pointed her finger in our face. Terrible service and terrible accommodations."}
{"text":"Had dinner there for the first time on 6.22.16. It was very comfortable, great atmosphere! The cornbread was AWESOME! The chips and guacamole were excellent too! The service was great!"}
{"text":"From the moment you step foot in the door you feel the warm energy. Staff is PHENOMENAL!  Every server is gorgeous working with a smile at all times. You instantly feel comfortable as the home cooked delicious aroma fills the air. Our DELIGHTFUL waitress Glorianna was the BEST. She was knowledgeable about everything and had wonderful recommendations for a first time customer. Just lovely and such a sweet doll! Although ALL the staff, including the hard working manager, all pitch in to help make the experience top of the line I suggest you request to be seated in Glorianna's section. THE FOOD! Beef ribs and the ever amazing rotisserie chicken were fabulous! So super Tender,  seasoned to perfection and soooooooooo juicy!  Oh, and the sides!  Everything is made with a dash of extra effort that makes the quality of your meal special.  5 stars in my book because it is so rare for a menu to be done to perfection and have a staff that works above and beyond as they exude the pride they have in their resturant!  Very impressive.  Xoxo ciao bellas!"}
{"text":"This place was really great and we will definitely be back. My wife and I went for dinner on a Thurs night and we loved the food and the overall experience. I had the rotisserie chicken and my wife had butternut squash enchiladas. We were both very happy with the main course but the funny thing was that we really loved the house salad and the Ceaser salad we got to start off. Strange but they were delicious.  The service was very good so no complaints there. Parking is tough but we found street parking The prices were very fair and I had a beer and the wife had a mojito which was very good We also had coffee after dinner and it was delish!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, however the menu is very small. The service uses to be amazing and then the past few times I've eaten there their service has been terrible. It has completely changed my experience there. I will def. give it one more shot after all the good experiences I've had there, however if it still has not changed then I will not be going there for a while."}
{"text":"I love love love the food here. I usually get either a sad or a rotisserie chicken  I have never been let down here and the staff are always very efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"NOTE:  i usually order the same things here.    Fire grilled artichoke app:  home run Jalepeno corn bread:  best corn bread i've had Dip Duo:  skip the guac (it is good) for double cheese (it is awesome)  tip:  they will refill your chips.  don't stress...  Beef Ribs:  fall off the bone beef.  unreal.  I loved their old bbq sauce:  ask if they have any.  The mustard bbq is still excellent.  4 ribs on your plate.  Sometimes they switch up the menu and do a rib/chicken combo: just tell them you want ribs only.  Sides:  you can switch out anything.  Best sides:  fire roasted corn (only in season), spinach, roasted brussel sprouts.    Other Mains:  Tri-tip and Enchilada platter.  solid.  REQUEST:  bring back Izze soda's.     Service:  i'm not gonna lie...the Hosts/Hostesses are generally rude at Scottsdale (i've always had great service at the Corona del Mar location).  Bar is typically packed in the evening.  Server's have generally been great at both."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years but recently they changed a few menu items and policies:(  They no longer offer kids options for food so your forced to purchase a $26 dollar meal for a child. They also charge you extra for substituting  a veg instead of mashed potatoes. They feel mashed potatoes are a garnish for the steak or fish. Bandera your in the hospitality business! I won't be back. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Bandera has a menu with something for everyone. This is the second time I've been there. The BBQ Salmon was delicious and the Macha Salad was awesome! The hostess staff and service were excellent."}
{"text":"Ok. Ate dinner here two nights ago. I had the roared prime rib with the seasoned mashed potatoes & broccoli. It was so good we went back this evening.   We were greeted & seated by a lovely young lady named Nicole. She was super pleasant & courteous. Our waitress, Brittney was awesome. Not only need she make the perfect suggestions for us but bought my Wife & I a round of drinks. The skillet cornbread was delectable. The Cajun Ribeye  was super flavorful & cooked to perfection. I can not express what a wonderful meal we had.   We introduced our selves to the manager & expressed our thanks & appreciation for the excellent dinning experience. I can not say enough about our two wonderful meals here. Thank you."}
{"text":"Wow! What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said! We walked in off the street not knowing what to expect, but we are sure glad we did. Immediately we noticed that we were perhaps a bit underdressed, but the wait staff was amazing at making us feel welcomed. We had our three small children with us, which is also not a great idea here, but our server went above an beyond to make them comfortable as well. You have to get the cornbread appetizer! It is the best cornbread I have ever had! I also had the tuna for my meal and it was delicious! Very intimate atmosphere; great for a date night or get together with friends. The servers are absolutely amazing, and the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"My first date with my husband was at Bandera, he proposed to me at Bandera, and every year to celebrate our anniversary we eat at Bandera. It never disappoints. I love walking through the back door and saying hi to the kitchen crew who are incredible, not to mention the cleanliness of the kitchen! Big points for that! Hostess is prompt and genuine. Great smile! Here's the best part. Every year we celebrate we always get the same server without requesting her. The universe has spoken and Amy is by far the best. She served us on our first date, at the proposal, and on our anniversaries.I need to keep her around as a good luck charm!! Excellent service , anticipates our needs, and gives us the space we need to enjoy our meal. The meal itself is part of the top notch experience. To die for prime rib. Perfectly executed. I really do enjoy myself when I dine here,I don't have to manage my experience. It is very hard for a trained Chef ,such as myself, to let go and enjoy. Thank you Bandera and team for creating such beautiful memories for my family."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant in Old Scottsdale! Chicken that is done on the spit, corn bread hot and crisp from the oven and the best coleslaw I have ever eaten! Service is exceptional! What a great place!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Not accommodating and wouldn't seat more than 5. Hostess was snarky and pompous. Can't rate the food; wouldn't seat us because there were 6 of us."}
{"text":"Let your nose lead the way....  This is one of the few restaurants that can draw you in by olfactory senses alone, thanks to a giant outside rotisserie that seems to excite your senses and it only gets better.  The food is simply wonderful, I recommend trying the Southwest Corn bread appetizer to start off the evening and all of the entrees are extraordinarily well done. I have dined at Bandera numerous times with everyone from in-laws to business associates trying numerous dishes including fish, chicken, lamb, and steaks. The lamb will melt in your mouth, the chicken is wonderful, and the steaks enchilada style are sizzling in more ways than one!   It's been a wonderful experience each time as far as the food and the atmosphere. The lighting is wonderful, it casts a very warm flattering glow over the ugliest of my friends and it is definitely a place to take a date or celebrate with friends. Well over 95% of the time the service is spot on, they are responsive, friendly, accurate, etc.  but there have been a few small preventable mistakes (the nights in question were very busy so it is somewhat understandable)."}
{"text":"Fast service, great atmpsphere, and corn bread that I am STILL dreaming about.  Seriously now....this is the best corn bread on the planet. Next time I might just order a plate of it for dinner."}
{"text":"A MUST, every time I go to Scottsdale!  The best \"Mashed Potatoes\" you have ever tasted. I haven't figured out what is chopped up in them, but they are heavenly! The rib and chicken combo is our perennial favorite to share. It is alot of food for the money! The ribs just fall off the bones, they are so tender and nice! Yes,  the cornbread is spectacular.  I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"The Good:  The service was super attentive, the ambiance was really fine, the food was good, particularly the chunky guacamole in the Dip Duo and the steak my companion ordered.  The bar menu was interesting and the wine list was well chosen.  My companion's dessert, a homemade Oreo sandwich, looked amazing.  The Not So Good:  I have food intolerances, but I'd rather just order carefully than discuss them with strangers.  That means I rely on accurate menus, not ordering the entrée that comes with ponzu, even though I love Ahi, and asking for no almonds on my Macho Salad.  It's really good and half as big as one I'd make for myself, which makes it a very large salad, but it was a chore removing the many croutons and getting all the corn out would have required more patience than I have.  I'd probably eat here again quite happily, if it didn't require that conversation (\"So, I can't eat..., etc.), but it does, so I'd rather move on to one of the many other fine restaurant choices in Phoenix and Scottsdale."}
{"text":"In 10+ years, I have never had a bad meal or experience at Bandara. A lot of love goes into their food and it comes with great ambience. Best beef ribs in AZ."}
{"text":"Wood fire grilled chicken and lamb. Delicious. Try the cornbread, moist with a hint of jalapeño. Good service, good food, quiet enough for conversation. Right in the middle of Oldtown. Third visit, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I like Bandera because it offers the quintessential multi-sensory experience.  As you walk from their parking lot you're given the opportunity to experience a blast of heat put off by the intense fire roasting their rotisserie chickens.  Once inside you are offered the opportunity to watch the chefs race each order to near perfection.  Plenty of booth seating provides a great way to converse with the people you are eating with, and many seats around the bar enable you to chat it up with the staff.  And all of that leaves the food - the most important sensory experience of any restaurant.  Bandera's food is quite good and that has led me to eating there more times than I can recall.  I am by no means a connoisseur, but I feel as though I am experienced enough with Bandera to suggest some pretty solid options.  Their rotisserie chicken and cornbread (perhaps two dishes that the restaurant is best known for) are very good.  I am a big fan of ordering a grilled artichoke for my appetizer and then following that up with the chicken enchiladas.  With that dish you get all the benefits of their great chicken, but with the added variety that enchiladas offer.  Plus the management at Bandera has been altruistic enough to enable you to get an additional enchilada for $1 more.  Yet don't ask for a third enchilada for $1 because you won't get it; believe me I've tried.  And as I said just a few sentences earlier, their cornbread is really good.  So be my lemming and always order a skillet of this Bandera specialty - the jalapenos in this cornbread really set it apart."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town. Not only for the food but also the service."}
{"text":"Definitely a 5 star restaurant!  The food, the service, the atmosphere - all great!  I've been eating at Bandera since they opened so when we had out of town guests, this was the first restaurant we thought of to bring our guests.  They did not disappoint!   The grilled artichokes are wonderful! And if you're indecisive like me and can never decide what to order... don't worry, whatever you order will be great.  They don't accept reservations so head there early on weekends as they will get pretty busy."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great service. Order the little house salad and devised eggs plus a steak and you are golden."}
{"text":"Yum!! It has been well over a year and a half since I have been here but when I went it was great. I expected it to be a standard Houston's-tasting of food just eh ok. But, luckily I was wrong. This place is really nice looking and unique on the inside with raised booths. We had, I can't remember the exact name, Pork Sandwich (avocado, bbq sauce) & Ribs (they were going to take them off of the menu soon). I loved the sandwich and the shoestring fries that I ordered with them! The sandwich was pretty affordable at $13 (at least last year it was). I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place gets a 5 star rating from me!  We went to this restaurant this evening based on all of the prior yelp reviews.  The place was fairly busy for a Tuesday evening.  The hostess was busy seating other guests so one of the managers saw us and seated us immediately.  He asked us if we've eaten here before and when we told him we were from out of town he took the time to tell us what was good on the menu.  His (Luke) recommendations were on point!  I had the chicken and green rice platter, my husband had the tri-tip and enchilada platter.  He also recommended their house margaritas which is made fresh!  They were the best margaritas I have ever had.  We had an awesome server, Danny.  He knew when to approach us and not to approach us.   To top it off this restaurant is in a little area called Old Town Scottsdale.  What an adorable area!  Make sure to visit this area and go eat at Bandera!"}
{"text":"I only get to stop here now and then, about 3 times over the past 8 years. Each time it's a delight! Crowded as always, we squeezed in at the bar and had the cutest girl Megan wait on us, so friendly and attentive. Enjoyed our appetizer at the bar. The skillet cornbread and coleslaw are two must haves!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a corporate steak house.   My service was great and the drinks were full all night. My steak was cooked well, I like that they use a wood fire grill. For a corporate steak house I was impressed and I enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"The service that we received was awesome. A must try is the skillet cornbread."}
{"text":"This was the place to come to back in my college days! Fast forward to Valentines day 2011. I was a little behind and I know the Mrs. Was hoping to go out and enjoy the Monday evening. As I frantically called around, they said they could guarantee a reservation for me, but they normally do not take reservations. I was OK with that.   We arrived hungry so the all too memorable smell wafted in the air. We had a drink at the bar and did not wait long at the bustling bar. The bartenders are on it here! Great service!   Once seated, we ordered the grilled jumbo artichoke. So good! The corn bread is good too! I had the aged prime rib with mash potatoes ($26) and veggies. The Mrs. had Chicken enchilada ($15) that was meh. Wine was good, service was awesome! No room for desert.   We forgot that there is good people watching here too. I guess pretty people got to eat too!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and excellent service!  Went there on business and had the aged Prime Rib.  You can watch them cook right there behind the bar.  They have great service and a friendly staff.  If I go back to AZ on another trip I will go here another time!!!  They also have TVs and good beer on tap so it sort of a sports bar with amazing food but not noisy; just cozy.  I put prices at $$$ but they have other items on the menu.  The fried corn bread is really nice.  I thought it would be boring but enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I was in town for business, and I decided to give this place a try.  The food was good, but a little overpriced for what it was.   The service was terrible. The waitress misplaced my credit card and implied it was my fault. She said \"Im 99% sure I gave it back to you\".   After frantically looking all over our seats and floor for about 10 minutes,  the waitress came back with our credit card and made an excuse how she misplaced it.  I'm \"99% sure\" she wont be getting a tip....  It ruined the whole experience.   I recommend going to a restaurant where they take value in protecting your credit cards."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going go Bandera for over 20 years ... since it first opened.  You can tell they take great pains to train their staff, although not inexpensive, the drinks are excellent and food good ... except for a major mistake they just made.  We LOVED their mashed potatoes.  I have several times gone to Bandera only their side of mashed potatoes and a drink at the bar.  It was worth the trip.  Now they cheapened the potatoes ... a creamy mush of nothing special even when compared to other much less expensive restaurants.  I assume this was done to cut the prep cost in the kitchen to improve the profit margin ... i.e. Less labor and cheaper ingredients.  I would gladly pay an extra buck or two for the old mashed potatoes ... I will not even even order the new ones again.  Tonight I had them take mine back and remove the cost from my check.  What else are they going to change to cheapen the food experience ... is there new management???  They may have lost a long time local resident customer.  If they do that to their unmatched mashed potatoes of the past, what else are they planning to do to cheapen the quality of their food in the hope their past reputation will fool their customers .  Often this is a slippery slope to mediocrity and the beginning of the end for a formerly well-run restaurant.  Sadly I have seen it too many times over the years.   It makes me sad because it is unnecessary ... a self-inflicted wound and a loss of a formerly wonderful restaurant experience.  I will try you again, Bandera, but you are on probation."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  I have never had a bad meal there.  There cornbread with green chilies is to die for and their Asian coleslaw is the best in the world.  They also make the best margaritas I have ever had. They also have a restaurant in Corona Del Mar (Newport beach, ca) and it is just as good.  The service is always exceptional. I highly recommend you try this restaurant if you haven't had the opportunity."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night.. The staff was very friendly. I would stick w appetizers and sandwiches.  The main entrees were skimpy and my son and I had the Carolina Beef Ribs - do not get this dish.. They gave us both 4 ribs that were dry to the bone.. Again, I notice mostly everyone ordering appetizers and sharing sandwiches, which were really good from tasting my wife's. My son and I were still hungry and went down the street to Capo's for an cheese steak.."}
{"text":"The rotisserie chicken and ribs combo was excellent. I ordered it with mashed potatoes which were also delicious. The ribs were beef and came with a mustard type sauce. It was a bit tangy and delicious. The chicken was nice and juicy."}
{"text":"Load and expensive. Dud not have a good feeling leaving.  It was very difficult to hear each other not to mention it was expensive."}
{"text":"In oldtown Scottsdale. Cool place with great food and super service. We had the cornbread appetizer which was wonderful. Also had the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and cucumber salad. This was our first time to Bandera and will come back again next time in Scottsdale. Loved it."}
{"text":"When we get into town, this is the first place we come!  As always the macho salad is first on our list, followed by the grilled artichokes.  Sadly we never have room for dessert, but I hear its amazing!"}
{"text":"I think this was the best prime rib I've ever had. The service was great! The drinks from the bar were excellent. Great all around!"}
{"text":"This place is getting 3 stars because their bartenders and hostesses are slow and rude. They have these crazy rules too that you can only make reservations for five or less.  And if you have a party of 7, they only have two booths to accommodate you, but they don't tell you that when you call to make reservations.  So, we had to wait an hour. Even though a booth that would fit 6 (and could easily fit 7) was open - they wouldn't allow us to sit there.  And don't even try coming with 8 people, they won't allow that many at a table.  So, besides that and the slow service at the bar, we still managed to have a good time.  My Carnitas Sandwich with Braised Pork, Avocado & Rio Grande Glaze was delish - although I would prefer it without the avocado.  I also got the mac and cheese - which was just okay - I wouldn't recommend it.  I stole some of the shoestring fries from a friend - they were quiet tasty!  Also, my glass of wine Mi Sueño El Llano (a cab) was perfect.    All in all, I would come back here with a girlfriend or a date.  Definitely not a good place to dine with a group!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with family for a birthday dinner, and we were excited to be back at Bandera, as we had great food on each previous dining visit. The last time here was about a year ago and everything was delicious. However, last night we left so disappointed in our meals and the service.  First of all, the meals were at our table in minutes!  Kind of too soon, as we were enjoying the cornbread and conversing before eating. The Brussels sprouts were very undercooked - too hard to enjoy.  The ribs were dry and tough, and NOT falling off the bone like I had remembered. And the mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant.  We all remembered them being one of the highlights of our meals and last night they were the type you'd get at Denny's!  We asked one of the waiters if the restaurant changed management and he hesitatingly replied, \"I'm not sure....\"  My margarita was taken away before I was finished and I was never asked if I wanted another.  We definitely got the feeling that they just wanted to flip our table fast. Then when we asked for the remainders of our dinners to go, our waiter unceremoniously plopped three plastic containers down in the middle of our table.  No offer to help us wrap, no bag to carry them out, nothing. $30 plus a plate and we wrap our own leftovers? We finally asked for a bag and we got one.  All in all, this was a huge disappointment for us and I personally won't be going back at these prices.  Bandera, you've lost one of your biggest fans."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place! I will say, the food is very good. The problem we had was with the service. It seems we were instantly profiled, as the hostess sat us at the worst possible table, in a mostly empty restaurant. Our table was right next to the dish station and we could hardly hear eachother over the constant clang of dishes. We asked our waitress to be moved to a less noisy table. She seemed really irritated and moved us to the table nearest the door, with the cold night breeze coming through the doors right at us. With the table change came a new server, she was really nice. We just couldn't get over their blatant desire to sit us at the absolute worst tables when every other table was open. We spent too much money and tipped too well to have been treated like that. We probably should've just left and spent our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great wine list & the food melts in your mouth. The price point is excellent for the quality of food!!! Highly recommend roasted chicken or the enchiladas. You're missing out if you haven't been here."}
{"text":"Thank you for RUINING our anniversary. My boyfriend and I had a gift card to Ra and Bandera, and we decided to grab a quick bite at Ra since it was their 15th anniversary and dessert and wine at Bandera. During our 'quick bite' we were towed from the parking lot because we didn't have 'dinner' at Bandera, even though we showed a receipt of giving them business. $150 tow fee and absolute rudeness from the Manager  later, we will not be back, nor will we recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We love Bandera! Of all of the Hillstone concepts in the city, this is the warmest and most friendly. It feels like a cozy neighborhood spot (albeit an expensive one...) but the food and service is always on point.   The staff seems to go out of their way to get to know their guests and they have an uncanny way of remembering you even if you have only been in once or twice.   If we could afford it, we would be here every week- but it is still a monthly go-to on our list of date night spots."}
{"text":"It's a very upbeat restaurant and you usually need reservations in the evening.  The food is delicious and very large portions. One of the best salads I've ever had (the Macho salad). They are famous for their wood-fired rotisserie chicken.  I wasn't a fan of the thin french fries though.  The burgers are also delicious too. Overall a great place to meet friends or go on a date with great food.  Although I don't believe they have any outside seating."}
{"text":"Came here for a buddy's b-day. I was amazingly surprised at how good this place was. Their salad (I had the Caesar) was incredible. Their rotisserie chicken dish was really good as well. Definitely on par with restaurants in NY, and in some cases much better than some overly hyped places in NY (I'm looking at you No. 7!) I've also heard very good things about their burgers.   The food isn't going to blow your socks off with any new unique flavor or flare. They don't have a Picasso working the kitchen but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It keeps prices reasonable and what they do make, they make it very well. I didn't get to try 30 restaurants in the area but I have to imagine this has to be one of the best ones.   I should also mention that the service and ambiance of the place were also excellent. Great place for a special occasion or a nice night out when you don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Due to being a loyal Houston's patron, I decided to give Bandera a try because of their direct relationship. The difference was night and day... Bandera's servers were very inattentive and almost rude regarding all aspects of communication during my dining experience. My filet was mediocre at best and not worth the price tag. This place gave off a very cold and insincere vibe. I will most definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is truly 5 star worthy. Every drink I've had here has been top notch, from their margaritas, to their mojitos, to their gin and tonics made with Hendricks gin. Perfection. Their food is just as good. The cornbread is a must, I get it everytime I go, and the fish is always fresh and perfectly cooked. The menu is only a page long, but everything they offer is top notch.  If you'be been meaning to try this place, get on it, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazing Food!!   You can't go wrong at Bandera. The food here is soooo good. I've had the Artichoke appetizer, the side salad and the prime rib, ribs, fish sandwich and chicken for entrees and don't forget about the banana cream pie! The artichoke is served with a delicious mayo like with lots of seasonings sauce, the salad comes with goat cheese and a deviled egg and the entrees all come with your choice of a unique side such as maple sauce carrots, red cabbage with goat cheese or whatever the side of the night is. The chicken which is suppose to be their signature dish is ok, not much flavor to it but everything else I've had there is to die for!   My boyfriend is quite particular about where we go to eat but would love to go to Bandera every night of the week if we could.   One warning: Ladies - the floor is very slick so make sure you wear shoes that have some grip on them. Last time I was there I almost did the splits but was saved by the guard rail on the 3 stairs up to the dinner area. Embarrassing..."}
{"text":"I love love love the chicken sandwich. Very eclectic menu. We always start with the chips and guac/cheese duo no matter the entree we choose. I don't love the skinny skinny fries, but taking a big handful makes it sorta feel like one normal sized :)!"}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience at Bandera. We were greeted at the door and promptly seated. We had a pre- meal cocktail while waiting for our dinner and our server Jenna actually brought me a replacement chilled glass for my drink, I had the chicken-rib combo and my wife had the BBQ salmon. Both were excellent. I can't say enough about the great service that we received here. Although they were slammed with the Spring Training crowd, we didn't feel rushed at all."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed !  My husband and I were looking forward to taking friends after the Good Guys car show. We asked for table of 6, were seated and then asked to leave as 1 of our guests didn't arrive, therefor we couldn't have the table for 6. My husband offered to pay for an extra meal, but we were refused. Across the street we went to Bucca de Peppi, and enjoyed a wonderful meal and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fabulous service. Don't believe the other reviews. Many choices on the menus and great food!  Busy on a Tuesday night. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Amazing food always great service. Shout out to Nica she was great tonight."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed by the meals here and especially tonite our server Jordan earned 4.5 stars for her amazingly enthusiastic service. She was attentive, considerate of when to interrupt and passionate about our satisfaction. I've dined at 3 star Michelin restaurants where the maitre d/server ratio is up to 4 or 5 to a table, so if that is the bar of my perfect 5 star measure then getting a 4.5 really made my nite!  Our meal at Bandera always includes the duo dip where I pass on the guacamole and enjoy double scoops of the jalapeño cheese dip. It really is divine and chips are easily replenished not even before you've seen the bottom of the dish. Then for more of a blended sweet savory side dish the skillet jalapeño cornbread always is a welcome choice.   Hubby and I shared tonite's special 14oz ribeye and it was definitely enough food after we stuffed ourselves with apps. A minor criticism is that our medium turned into medium well but as I enjoy the perimeter fattier area of the steak I wasn't as bothered. Great food and the triple filtered tap water in a frosty refreshingly cold glass always makes an H2O lover like me come back!"}
{"text":"Management is terrible.  Service is meh.  Support a local business and try somewhere else.  I recommend OhSo which is a bit of a drive or Pink Pony or RA is right next door.  I'd even go to buca de beppo across the street over this place.    Never again."}
{"text":"My parents come in a few times a year and love to eat at bandera. I've explained to them that people who actually LIVE here don't frequent this spot but tonight I gave in. Walked in at 6:45. 4 adults and 2 small-ish kids. The restaurant was empty with large booths around the perimeter that were desolate. There are ONLY 2 booths in the entire over priced rotisserie chicken joint that accommodate 6 people and they are on a first-come-first-serve basis. Both were filled.  However when I asked about the uninhabited LARGE booths I was told we we could not sit there because \"That's not how their restaurant functions\". After asking for the manager and hearing his lame excuse of why he can't seat us in the booth that would spontaneously combust if the 6 of us sat there we decided to take our business else ware. Good luck with that small minded business model Bandera. When you are looking for 6 hungry deep pocketed patrons to fill your failing chicken joint, we will be down the street enjoying our dinner and laughing."}
{"text":"I had the best rotisserie chicken ever in this restaurant.  Don't really know their secret but even with white meat, it's so tender and full of flavor!  You'll feel relaxed there, the waiters are so genuine and friendly that it seems like they really care about you.  I am always skeptical about having rotisserie chicken for dinner because I could live with Boston Market's anyway, but this one is so much better than any others I've tried.  The restaurant is roomy and dark but it's quiet enough to carry a good conversation with friends (in my case it's my boss.)  I greatly recommend this restaurant if you are in Scottsdale and want to eat chicken."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here for years and we've never had a complaint except for now.  We came to the restaurant and I had a  Penn State hat on.  I was told that it had to come off to sit in the dining room which was two rows away from the bar.  This Fiesta Bowl weekend folks! Really???  Also my drinks were served in a smaller glass than what was severed at the bar for the same drink - totally bad form.  We loved your restaurant but we're hesitant to return.  Your portions have gotten smaller while you're increasing the price. What happened to the Bandera we loved?"}
{"text":"Usually, I would give them a 4 or 5 because the food is fabulous, but I had a bad experience there recently.  The salmon  was raw in the middle (a little frustrating when you have to wait as long as you do at Bandera for a table or seat at the bar ect and not be able to eat your food when it comes).  I sent it back to be cooked but asked for chips and guac to snack on in the mean time.    I'm not all about getting a free meal because of inadequate cooking, but they could have at least comped the guac for me while I waited for them to cook my meal---again!   They didn't.  I was charged for it. I give Banderra a 4 or 5 for the food when it's cooked properly, but a 2 for the service.  The servers (actually the bartenders)  need some training in handling issues  and providing quality service at an upscale restaurant ."}
{"text":"To earn a 5 star rating your place has to exceed all expectations in food quality, service, atmosphere, and eating out experience. This place delivers on all fronts.   Others must agree with my assessment because we showed up at 6pm and waited over an hour for our table. No problem! A waitress walks through the crowd and takes drink orders. Nicely played Bandera!  The Chilean sea bass was absolutley one of the top 3 things I have eaten in my life  I almost ate it all, and it was my wife's.   We had read reviews about the cornbread skillet so we ordered it. It was huge and only $5 so you can't lose. It was so good it didn't need any butter or honey with it.   Our server was attentive and helpful.  First, the hostess was able to find us in the crowd without a vibrating coaster or annoying intercom system.  Our waitress was able to transfer our bar tab to our dinner ticket which made things easier.   The atmosphere is loud because of the number of people but very professional. A sign on the door says no shorts allowed. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Annual visit to Bandera's and was surprised to see a new menu  I had called in reservations advising that there would be 3 birthday boys, Hubby, SIL, and Son and a toddler. When we arrived, they made us wait until everyone was there which I don't understand why restaurants do that. Then we get to the table and there were only 4 place settings and no booster chair or high chair. Service was terrible. Waitstaff tried to clear table while we were still eating. Felt rushed but didn't see any customers waiting to be seated. Not only that, but there was no special offering of dessert for the birthday boys. We ordered the skillet cornbread, which was a little underbaked. Also ordered the green rice which was bland. SIL ordered the veggie platter and did not eat the tuna; it looked overcooked. Son had the ribs and chicken and the chicken was good. It should be since that is their signature dish. The ribs were beef and they were tender. They no longer have the pork spareribs, which is what Son wanted. Hubby ordered the prime rib and it was tough and overpriced. He substituted the mashed potatoes for the coleslaw which he's had in the past, but the kale in the coleslaw had not sat long enough in the dressing to have wilted and was still too crunchy for his palate. I didn't mind it, but since Hubby and Son have had this side dish in the past, they didn't feel it met up to their standards. All in all an average dinner and I had to take down the rating primarily because of the waitstaff and hostess and less than stellar food."}
{"text":"Banana Cream Pie Heaven!   Definitely one of the best deserts on the planet.  Over the years, I have been to various Bandera restaurants numerous times and the food and service are always, consistently good.  Bandera is definitely a place to \"see and be seen\" -- and is especially popular with a fairly well-heeled crowd of folks who drive 7-series BMW's and wear fancy gold Rolex's.  The bar also has the reputation of a world-renown cougar pickup joint --  But, if you can get past the obvious pretentiousness the food and atmosphere are always excellent.    The to-die-for Veggie Burger and Chicken Enchiladas are stand-out good items on the menu.  A dedicated meat lover -- the Bandera Veggie Burger is hearty enough to stand it's own against any steak sandwich.  Get braised cabbage with goat cheese as your side and you won't be sorry!  The grilled artichoke appetizer is also very good, albeit overpriced for what you get: a split artichoke with a tiny cup of very good aoli sauce.   Overall, a very good meal, for a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"Just went here on a short vacation to Scottsdale with my wife. It is by far our favorite restaurant. We don't come to Scottsdale often but when we do we go to Bandera! Best prime rib I think we have ever eaten, and the cornbread and artichokes or I must have!"}
{"text":"I am only giving this one star as you have to give one to leave a review. This place, staff, management and corporate don't deserve any starts!  This was my first time eating here (March 10, 2014) I had some friends just get in from Cali that I had not seen in 25 years. We picked them up from their hotel around the corner at 5:45 and we were seated promptly for our 6:00 reservation. My girlfriend and I split a bottle of wine while my boyfriend and other friend had a martini.  When our dinner came we ordered a bottle of wine for the four of us. We had started with the artichoke appetizer which was probably the only good thing about our whole visit.  Our dinners came and we had not yet gotten our bottle of wine. My friend went to ask the waitress if we could get our bottle of wine as our dinner has been served. She said \"OK\".   We started eating our meals, I had the rotisserie chicken dinner with the green rice. My chicken was bland and red in the middle and my rice was cold. Before I could say anything, the waitress came to the table to see how it was, but we again asked for our bottle of wine. She than told she could not serve us anymore alcohol and that was their policy because my friend and I had shared a bottle of wine. More than two people have to share a bottle. They didn't tell us that when they served it to us. So my friend went to talk to the manager, Nick. He told her he was not serving us anymore because she was already slurring her words! This really upset my friend and she came back to the table in tears. My friend was in a horrific car accident a few years ago and her speech has been affected and Nick took that as her being drunk!!!  So my boyfriend goes to talk to the manager and he said the same thing. Then the waitress came back to the table and we told her this was ridiculous and she said that a week prior someone had gotten a DUI after leaving the restaurant and blamed the restaurant for over serving them alcohol so they were being cautious.  The manager came back to our table and told my friend she was DRUNK! Right to her face and that he will not serve us anymore.  My friend didn't even touch her dinner she was so upset. I didn't eat much of mine as it was cold and not good at all and then the managers behavior turned me off.  My friend asked that he take her dinner off the bill because he upset her and he at first said \"NO\" but after our arguing, he did take if off which we appreciated.  I called corporate and spoke to a nice woman there. She said they have to protect the restaurant and they don't know if we came from somewhere else that my friend could have gotten drunk at.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  This restaurant is part of a big corporation so what do they care?  I explained to her that we will never be back and we will tell all of our friends. The manager should be more sensitive to people than thinking everyone is drunk all the time. The only thing the woman was concerned about was Nick's usage of words \"slurring\" and \"drunk\" and she said she would speak to him about his verbiage.  My girlfriend is owed a big apology!!  We will never go to any of these restaurants and I we will spread this to all of our friends so they don't go either.  We went somewhere else where they were more than happy to serve us alcohol and they had NO ISSUE with my friend who has a handicap!!!"}
{"text":"I came back for Valentines Day and I was disappointed. I hyped this place up so much to my boyfriend and when we got there Banderas dropped the ball. Not only was our reservation pointless and a waste of my time, my prime rib... The meal I always look forward too, the one I hyped up so much, was COLD when I started eating it. My boyfriends was also cold. What a waste. The free desert they provides showed they didn't care, their offer to throw our meat back in the fire shows how they are ignorant that reheated steak is awful, their offer to send us home with new ones shows the clear fact they don't understand how they ruined our Valentines Day.  Seriously Bandrea, what the hell happened to you guys? Truly, no longer my favorite restaurant..."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and each time we have a solid meal. Their strength is definitely consistency.   They have a fantastic rotisserie chicken that you can purchase to go or eat in the restaurant. It is what they are known for. My favorite entree is the Macho salad which is a really nice combination of the rotisserie chicken, toasted cornbread, fresh veggies, avocado, etc.   Last time we were there we also tried the ribs and they are excellent. The meat just fell of the bone and the sauce wasn't too heavy.   If you like rotisserie/BBQ, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Hungry for a late snack and drink after the basketball game. Came to Bandera because, well, we are obsessed with Hillstone restaurants. :) Decided to share something we've never had before...the butternut squash enchiladas. So delicious!! Flavor explosion in a dish. AND you can add a second enchilada for ONE DOLLAR! (Thanks to Jordon for the tidbit).  Hillstone/Houston's/Bandera/R&D, whatever you call yourself, you have the best Margaritas EVER, no salt please. This location no exception.  Thanks to Jordon for going above and beyond. You made our experience special and fun!!! Great end to a perfect day."}
{"text":"Great place to dine while visiting Scottsdale!  Ambiance of restaurant manages to balance traditional and trendy without coming off as old-school or pretentious.   The staff is amazing - incredibly accommodating and kind. But specifically, server Amy forever provides an excellent experience with unparalleled attention to detail."}
{"text":"Bandera is our go-to place to eat a truly fabulous meal. Everything they do is wonderful! The service is amazing, the atmosphere is perfect, and the food is ALWAYS good. The smoked salmon appetizer is truly the best I've ever had. I also recommend their enchilada side dish - it's a great portion for a full dinner for one person...and it tastes so good! I also love the artichokes when they're in season, the cornbread, the deviled eggs, and of course the roasted chicken is absolutely delicious. We like to sit at the bar to eat our dinner -- the bartenders know us by name and are so friendly. Bandera is the top restaurant to go to in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"So my firstime at Bandera for dinner.  Spent the whole day on a plane to arrive Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Luckily for us, artichokes were available to the chef and the appetizer 'grilled artichokes' was available.  THIS IS THE MOST OUTSTANDING PREPARATION OF ARTICHOKES...EVER!!  Chef Jason has nailed this for foodlovers worldwide.  Again...OUTSTANDING!!  The prime rib...well...nothing less than awesome.  A very subtle back flavor of herbs.  I had as the french dip sandwich and did not need the jus. Well done Chef Jason.  Our server Lindsey took great care of us.  We arrived a bit before rush hour...this place fills up fast.  No questions as to why."}
{"text":"I went to Bandera for dinner for a staycation weekend getaway with girlfriends and it was fantastic! I ordered the Macho Salad with slow-roasted rotisserie chicken, avocado, chopped almonds and goat cheese. So delicious. I think my favorite part was the croutons - fried, rich, warm, the perfect consistency. Cleaned my plate, perfect amount of food. YUM."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the area. You always get great food. The drinks are good. The service is very good. Make sure you have a reservation unless you do not mind to wait for long time."}
{"text":"My sister, daughter and I had dinner last night at Banderas.   Fun place with a nice bar and great ambiance. The service was excellent and so was the cornbread.  However, My dinner was somewhat of a disappointment. It came out with 2 ribs , 1 very small chicken leg, and a tiny piece of chicken, and mashed potatoes.   Thank goodness we ordered the cornbread!   Just felt that food was very over priced and really not all that great.   The server brought out hot towels which was very nice.   Next time I'll try the burgers!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not a genuine steakhouse. My Filet was undercooked and a bit bland. The Bone-in Ribeye was much better. 14.00 for a glass of wine was overpriced."}
{"text":"RUSHED OUT THE DOOR:  My wife and I invited some friends to this restaurant.  At first appearance, the service appeared to be genuinely good, but then it showed its true colors.  The Mustard Barbecue Beef Ribs were so burnt that when we called back the waiter, he recognized this before we even said anything and took it back.  We were brought the check without requesting it and without being offered dessert. As soon as we finished dessert, our water glasses and napkins were removed.  When I asked--tongue in cheek--if it was because he wanted us to leave, he said \"yes\" just loud enough for us to hear.  Feeling lead out the door, my wife and I were quite embarrassed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Dinner only. Try to make a reservation for priority seating. Still you might wait 45 minutes but its better than 90 mimutes!   Food is good. Try the grilled artichokes for starters."}
{"text":"Scottsdale has no shortage of restaurants with excellent food, so what makes one restaurant stand out?  In the case of Bandera it's excellent food coupled with authentic, warm hospitality.  True hospitality isn't taught, it's ingrained in the person.  Stealing the Chef would only be half the equation.  To truly succeed you would need to steal whoever does their hiring."}
{"text":"I have to say, the skillet made cornbread definitely lived up to the hype!  It is SO GOOD, a crunchy sweet crust on top, a savory, almost muffin like inside that is filled with cheddar cheese, jalapenos, and maybe even some onions and chives.  Wow, TASTY!  and totally worth the $5 for an app. to share.  Now, I have read other reviewers say that the rotisserie chicken is the king.  So I had it, and I have to quote Jim Carrey in Liar Liar - \"I've had better.\"  It was good chicken, I have certainly had better other places.  The spanish rice, however was the best I have had. now that is good stuff.  Too much cilantro on their escabeche made it awkward to eat.    It was a great place to eat, perfect lighting, AMAZING waiter service, and tasty local Amber brew.    Great place for a night out in Old Town...."}
{"text":"Flavorful southwestern flare in a tiny dark homey spot- subtle Hillstone- esque tones with the decor.  We were seated with a smile in Steve's section who was timely & personable.  I tried the classic margarita no salt which was so yummy my husband traded me his grapefruit tequila martini drink.  Loved them both and the dip duo- Steve offered to bring more chips but the amount served was good for us.  One dip is a cheesy cold salty yumminess and the second dip is a chunky freshly prepared guacamole.  For our entree we shared the tri tip and enchilada.  The enchilada was Melty cheese and some spinach I think but it was the highlight served with half green sauce and half red.  The tri top was seasoned perfectly and charred in the edges.  A little chopped salad is served with this which has a nice broad range of veggies from cauliflower, onions, cucumbers, and a goat cheese crumble.  Our favorite dish was the banana Creme pie!  We had 2 rounds of coffee and enjoyed the casual festive ambiance.  We overheard the table next to us inquire about the rotisserie chicken which apparently is marinated 72 hrs in citrus and then slowly rotisseried.  Going to try that next time!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! The decor is beautiful  and comfortable...the service perfect and the food so delicious. Can't wait to take the rest of my family there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite chains. I lived in Chicago and frequently ate at the Michigan Avenue location.  Been to the old town Scottsdale location 3 time on different business trips. Loved it every time. Cornbread is a must have. I get the rotisserie chicken and beef rib combo!"}
{"text":"This is a go-to for me when I have visitors or when I want to take family to a very nice (but not crazy expensive) dinner. Everyone I've taken has enjoyed their meals, and we keep going back. I love the salmon, the meatloaf and of course the chicken. When artichokes are in season, we always order them to start. The only disappointment comes if you don't make a reservation during tourists are in town because, trust me, I'm not the only one who is a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here so many times and this place has never grow old on me. The food is always a great treat if I'm looking to have a delicious dinner. The fillet is usually my regular but I've tried many other item from their menu and it never failed me down. Great restaurant in old town scottsdale. Ps: don't forget to get the peanut coleslaw as a side they have taken it to hole new different level. Highly recommended !!"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed the food and service for several years. Food has always been very good for all items. Take out service is very easy to use. Try the artichokes!!! A Old Town favorite for me."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place! Fiance took me here for my birthday dinner and we absolutely loved it! The ambiance and vibe in this restaurant is wonderful. Super clean, great music, great service and amazing food! We had the guacamole and queso appetizer and yet, a little small, it was SO good. He had the chicken, I had the ribs. Both were stellar.  We were able to grab a drink at the bar while we waited, only about a 15 minute wait. Guests at the bar sitting next to us were soo fun and nice as well! Cant wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Cornbread croutons in the Caesar salad!! Grilled artichokes, house-smoked salmon, tri-tip and enchilada platter all amazing!!"}
{"text":"Love love love Bandera!!!! Best cornbread you'll ever have!!! Never a disappointment coming here always look forward to it!!!"}
{"text":"In April of 2010, we went to the Bandera in Old Town Scottsdale after being treated like dirt at the Italian Grotto. Our food at Bandera was excellent and the service was top-notch. It easily is the nicest place in downtown Scottsdale for VERY good food, really nice atmosphere, and VERY good service !"}
{"text":"Just got back from a trip to Phoenix and i have to give kudos to Bandera.  We didn't know where to go and got a recommendation here. The meal was great.  Don't miss the cornbread, it was spectacular.  It was warm, moist, tasty, delicious! I couldn't make up my mind between the chicken and the ribs, so i got both.  I'm not one to eat a lot of roasted chicken when i was out, but this was very good.  Juicy and cooked just right.  There weren't a lot of ribs, but the meat fell off the bone into my mouth.  MsD had the chicken as well and couldn't finish it, though she really liked it.  Being from South Jersey, I consider myself a bit of a corn snob.  I snickered at getting corn in Phoenix, but Bandera had it seasoned nicely with butter and garlic to make it edible.  Quite the complement from a Jersey Boy! The service was excellent, our waiter Stefan was there when we needed something, but not intrusive.  As we were walking around Old Scottsdale we ran into a couple of eastern travelers who were looking for a place to go.  We sent them to Bandera without a second thought.  Wish we could go back soon, but we'll have to wait until we're out west again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. This is me and my wife's go to place if we ever want to take friends to a new place. The fire roasted chicken, and the cornbread is to die for. The cornbread is the best ever!!! Although this is one of our favorite places, we are disappointed that they just took the house salad off their menu. It was truly to die for and it is sad they took it off the menu."}
{"text":"Okay Bandera. After a long hiatus we decided to try you again with some friends. At one time you were our favorite restaurant and we would come here as many as eight times a year. That quit happening after a series of rushed undercooked meals where the last time all in our party were ill. That is stomach wise.   Returning we found the same great atmosphere. The restaurant was comfortably cool and the corn bread was outstanding again unlike the last few trips where it was over cooked and dry. Had their rotisserie chicken which I always liked. Here is my problem. Now it comes with mash potatoes instead of their summer rice. That was disappointing. Service was rushed as usual. This was off season. We were with another couple. SLOW it down.  Anyway long story short. Probably won't be back for another few years."}
{"text":"Bandera doesn't try to do it all---they have a small menu and they those items well. My personal favorites are the roasted artichokes, jalapeño cornbread (served in an iron skillet), Caesar salad with a creamy dressing with just a hint of Southwest. I also enjoyed the prime rib (med-rare). My friends enjoyed their salad, chicken enchilada a la carte and roasted chicken. Service was attentive and friendly, but would've liked to have been asked if we were done with our dishes and drinks before they so efficiently stealthed by to take them away before we were done. The only downside was waiting over an hour to be seated because we had no reservations. We were able to keep ourselves entertained at the bar while we waited, and the margaritas and mojitos were great!"}
{"text":"It's not as good as it used to be.  The ribs and chicken used to fall off of the bone they were so moist and tender.  Tonight they were just ok, nothing stood out as spectacular, this used to be a standout as traditional excellence goes.  They have gone by the way of the foodie and it's not the niche we need them to fill."}
{"text":"A Scottsdale classic. Loved coming here for 15 years.  The recipes were classic and brought people back year after year.  Lately however the menu has slowly been changing and not necessarily for the better.  First the classic rotisserie chicken we changed making like everyone else's chicken and potatoes.  The green rice was brought back but not the tortilla sauce ( although they still have it upon request.  Another classic they've abandoned was their take on the Pimm's cup.  The latest incarnation lowers the standard to be just like every other bar/restaurant in Scottsdale.  If you are coming back for the classics you probably won't find them here. 4 of our last 5 visits, the grilled artichoke hasn't been available and is MP3 longer a regular menu item.   Still the food is still good and the service outstanding. Although food often comes out of the kitchen not warm enough."}
{"text":"Excellent environment. Food was just so-so. Not sure we will be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Looking for a top notch Dinner? Look no further. Bandera which is part of Hillstone restaurants has it all. Central location, attentive and helpful service, scrumptious grub, delicious drinks and nice ambiance. I went with some girlfriends but the restaurant boasts a dimly lit romantic vibe so would be great for a date night.   I am an unapologetic carnivore so I went with the gigantic prime rib, while my friends had ribs and chicken dishes. Each plate had superb presentation and the potatoes had a delicious cheesy flavor we loved. All in all, we had ourselves one damn good dinner and look forward to my next visit.  Tip- make a reservation"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Old Scottsdale, with Barrio Queen a very close second.  The margarita here is the best.  The Rib Eye special has been spectacular (although I personally am not a fan of Greek salad so that side gets left behind).    Nice upscale atmosphere even if it is part of a chain.  Didn't know there was one in LA so I'll have to try it.  Very sweet bartending staff where I always sit to have dinner.  Why is it all women behind the bar?  A few men wouldn't hurt.  Limited menu but the barbecued chicken is very good."}
{"text":"Awesome! mustard beef ribs are a must.  We ordered the jalapeño corn bread as an appetizer and received perfect service; very attentive yet not obtrusive.   The best meal I've had on my trip and would return without any hesitation."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience.. Kudos to the manager, Keith, who sent a free round of free appetizers because our table was not ready. I highly recommend the macho salad!"}
{"text":"Service at the bar has really declined lately.  Was there for 20 minutes and was never asked for my food order, there were 4 people at the bar including myself."}
{"text":"You can always tell a good restaurant by the line of patient diners waiting for a table. In Old Town Scottsdale, the one place you will nearly always find a line of hungry folks Bandera's on Scottsdale Road at First Street.  Once the summer heat turns temperate, the walls open up and the entire restaurant enjoys the great Arizona weather. The food? Don't worry. Just start out with an order of the best corn bread you ever tasted, add a favorite BBQ or steak, sandwich or your choice of great foods, always great.  Service is robust and on target. Atmosphere is cozy and comfortable, you won't be disappointed. BTW, the roasted chicken is outstanding and available for pick up too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but menu/options are limited. I asked for some soda water (from bar tap) for a friend who wasn't feeling well and that wasn't an option. We also asked about a side of macaroni and cheese which was not available. It's alright not to have it but we were not presented another similar offering or anything...just a \"no.\" The grilled artichokes were great!"}
{"text":"I love this place. There used to be one in my hometown, however it was sold and the name and menu were changed. When I moved to AZ and found another Bandera, I was thrilled. The food is always delicious, the bar is pleasantly crowded and employees are friendly and professional. I love that they serve the full menu at the bar. The smoked salmon is a huge delicious piece, and a great deal for $13. The appetizers are my favorite and I usually order almost one of each whenever I go-- the salmon, artichokes, and cornbread."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious! I have never had to wait to be seated. The service is great and every server I have had there was quick, attentive, and not annoying. The restaurant is intimate and I always feel relaxed there. We ordered the cornbread which was awesome! I have to say I don't usually eat salads, at all.. But when I read what the Macho Salad had in it, I decided to give it a try and wow it was excellent! It had avocado, roasted chicken, chopped almonds, and goat cheese. I never like salads but this one is incredible! I love it! I get it everytime I go. A family member of mine always gets the Bandera- Style roasted chicken which is always good and roasted to perfection. I have gone here a couple times and each time it has been excellent!"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced but that's likely because it's a chain.  Food is good and so are drinks.  Good atmosphere for a date or group of people."}
{"text":"SO good! Food was delicious, service was amazing, ambiance modern and chic. Would highly recommend if you want a special dinner!"}
{"text":"This is great restaurant.  The salmon and Tuna was cooked perfectly.  Ribeye steak was seasoned well and very tender.  We had Brussels sprouts, peanut coleslaw and mashed potatoes and it was very good.  I would come back to this restaurant and bring my friends."}
{"text":"Great food and service. You have to try the corn bread and save room for dessert!  The rotisserie chick is always amazing"}
{"text":"Great ambiance Walked in with no reservation but were promptly seated. Over the top service. My martini glass was replaced with a new frosted one half way through the drink. Love the lighting in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Like my little black dress that always fits & is a classic. This place is also a classic. Although unlike my little black dress Bandera's ever changing. The menu varies with seasonal vegetables, entrees & drinks come go like the seasons. The things I go to Bandera for don't change. The skillet green chili cornbread always hot, moist, sweet & salty just great. The macho salad is delicious from start to finish. All of the senses are tantalized completely. The burning flesh aka the rotisserie chicken calls my name when I turn the corner onto Scottsdale Rd. in Old Town it's always delish. The grilled artichokes & ice cold Stella don't hurt either. I recommend them one & all. Bring Friends or a hungry date & prepare to pull an Al Bundy & unbutton those true religions or better yet leave those at home girlie's because this isn't for the faint of heart. I do have one very very small issue I have begged and pleaded my pathetic desires for the basil martini to return & alas they have all been brutally rebuffed. Each of my food fairies aka wait staff have given me different versions of why it left the menu when on my last visit I was told it was a pain to make so they removed it. Finally, that's what was probably the most pathetic but refreshingly honest answer I'd been given to date. It was one the the few drinks on the menu that required multiple steps behind the bar beyond a pour of this & that. I loved it though & can now accept it's premature departure & lay my case to rest it was a pain to make. But like a high maintenance woman I wouldn't wanna put up with making it myself I did enjoy it while I could. Good bye Basil Martini & hel-lo Ginger Basil Martini. Not the same but a decent backup plan."}
{"text":"One star is generous. My table didn't even get halfway through appetizers before the staff infuriating us so much we walked out. Apparently bandara has a dress code (no hats, tanks), whatever that's understandable. (At the same time this place isn't Mastro's). One of the my guests had a bag which was placed next to the booth, this created a huge problem with the staff. He had moved his bag twice and the hostess came over to our table 3 separate times to Intrude on conversation and hassle us about the bag. Halfway through my salad I pulled a long blonde hair out of my mouth which came from my food. I told the manager about this and she looked at me like I had three heads. I'm VIP security at a high end club and my friend is the AGM at the same place. I would love to buy the management a table at our place of work and give you your first bottle on me so we can teach you proper customer service, you need it. Absolutely terrible!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant in Old Town...but get a reservation, as the secret is out!  This is a very good restaurant in the Old Town area, with a nice ambiance and great service. They have a good wine selection (bottle and by the glass), and a full bar featuring custom cocktails such an a Bullet Rye Old Fashioned (which I highly recommend).   The food is very good, with rotisserie chicken that you can see slowly turning on the rotisserie, smoked ribs, delicious salads and burgers to die for. You will not leave hungry, that is for sure.   You can eat at the bar or get a table, however there is usually a wait for tables, especially on the weekends.   The staff aim to please and will make it right...a very refreshing attitude of the staff and servers.   I really enjoy this place...you will too!"}
{"text":"If you come here for dinner on a weekend, prepare to wait.  This place is popular, and deservedly so.    They told us the wait would be 30 minutes, and it was 30 minutes.  Honesty, plus 1.  The service was super friendly and everyone seemed to remember our names, another plus 1.  The food came out very promptly and with no problems, plus 1.    We ordered the corn bread, which was HUGE (enough to share with four people) and came with some onions and jalapenos.  Warm and good (if you like what's inside).  Then we split their rotisserie chicken and their pork ribs.  I'm not a huge fan of pork, or of ribs, but these pork ribs were absolutely delicious.  They slid off the bone with no problem, and they were just the right amount of sweet and with very little fat.  The chicken was also pretty good, but I found it a bit dry.  It would have deserved 5 stars if the chicken was a bit more juicy and if they had a larger menu.  As it was, the menu was a bit limited."}
{"text":"Bandera has always been our go to date night spot if we are not in the mood to try new things.  The staff is always so nice and friendly, and the food is always on point.  They are well known for their rotisserie chicken as that is there staple.  It's a must get if you are big into country chicken and potatoes.  But my all time favorite is the burger, I am big burger guy so if you are looking to spend a little more than the average burger this is where you should spend the extra dollar.  The only reason I provided the 4 stars was because they are always busy especially on the weekend.  The staff is not to favorable when it comes to walk ins.  If you do plan to go to Bandera I highly recommend using the reservation app, because of you don't it will be an hour and half wait at the LEAST."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and they have some interesting choices - cornbread, peanut coleslaw.  The chicken is a healthy choice, but smells better than it tastes.  It is ok.  What struck us this time is the service.  The servers themselves were ok, I just think the management needs to receive and provide some training - and look at some of their silly policies.  We went on July 5th - a very slow day when we got there. We were meeting a friend who was visiting from out of town for dinner.  At least half the tables were empty, yet when we asked to be seated they said \"You can wait at the bar. We don't seat you until everyone is here.\"  We told them, half the tables are empty.  Can't we be seated?  \"It is our policy,\" they said.  After a bit of pleading with a \"you've got to be kidding me\", they agreed to seat us.  I can understand the policy if the restaurant was busy, but it was almost empty!  Then, the servers kept trying to rush us.  When our friend got there, the server kept trying to take our order.  We ordered some cornbread and said we wanted a little time to visit.  We got the cornbread, but kept getting rushed to order.  Once the food came, the servers (not just ours, but others) kept hovering by like they were checking us out. It was an unpleasant dinner.  Then, they kept trying to rush us out.  I am sensitive to staying in a restaurant and \"hogging\" a table, but that wasn't the case.  I could see the front door and kept an eye on it to make certain there were no people waiting.    If you want to get a quick dinner, then this place is fine.  If you want to enjoy a reasonable dinner, I'd find someplace else."}
{"text":"Awesome unpretentious food. That's what it  is here at Bandera Restaurant. Fine and fresh ingredients prepared to absolute perfection. We tried the grilled artichokes, grilled chicken and Butternut and white cheddar enchilada. Banana cream pie was just there, not great. We have tried other Hillstone restaurants, hustons, Hillstone, Rutherford grill in Napa, Los Altos grill in SF Bay Area. We will comeback to this place for sure. Their service is great too."}
{"text":"We used Yelp to find a place to eat in Old Town and of course it did not disappoint.  We arrived on a Thursday night around 7 and the place was slammed.  Since we did not have reservations the hostess said it would be a 25 minute wait.  I did find it odd that after telling us this, she selected \"25 minute wait\" on her ipad for our reservation.  I wonder if the software only called us after 25 minutes....  It didn't matter as we spend that time wandering around Old Town Scottsdale which was great.   The place reminds me of the \"Houston's\" chain with it's dark wood/steakhouse decor.  It's definitely pretty nice.    I'm not sure I would necessarily call the menu southwest since had cheeseburger, french dip, bangers & mash, and BBQ Salmon on the menu.  They also did not have a kids menu which didn't make our 7 year old too happy.    While outside you can see the chicken roasting on the rotisserie and it smelled awesome so I went with that.  My wife had the Kale Salad, and our kid the fried chicken sandwich (without the bread).  Overall the food was pretty good - the rotisserie chicken was juicy and flavorful.  Since our kid fell asleep we ended up eating her sandwich which was tasty. I was also a fan of the kale salad.  The menu is a little bit all over the place so I'm not sure I'd come here again, but it was a nice dinner in Old Town."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food ONE STAR for requiring men to have sleeves which has NEVER been a requirement in the over 10 years use come here!!!  How ridiculous is that when you run a business in a tourist town when it gets 100 to 115 degrees!!!  I've never known this to be a \"snob\" place but. .. corporate should take a look at the demographic."}
{"text":"We got reservations for Saturday night at 830pm.  The atmosphere was great and active.  We ordered the Dip Duo to start and even got a little more chips (hot and fresh!) to finish the plate. My friend ordered the filet (medium). She enjoyed every bite.  I wanted the meatloaf but they were sold out. I then ordered Bandera-style Roasted Chicken.  It was very good.  I love watching their chickens roasting outside.  A cool place.  Fun for a date and a small group.  I'll be back to try the meatloaf!"}
{"text":"One word: Consistency!    Time and time again Bandera's does not disappoint.  We used to go to the one in Newport Beach, CA and have dined at the Old Town Location a few times.  The food at Bandera is always consistent - so much so that when we don't know where to dine at we end up here because we know it will always be a fantastic meal.    We started off diner with a couple of Martini's with blue cheese stuffed olives - some of the best colossal olives out their!  Here's a nod to the top notch waitress, Ashley Z., halfway thru our martini's she noticed that the glasses weren't as chilled so she replaced our glasses.  We ordered the devil-eggs and fire roasted artichoke to start.  Definitely get the artichoke when it is in-season.  My Fiance ordered the rotisserie chicken which is a huge portion of their famous chicken - very moist and tender served with mash potatoes.  I had the BBQ salmon which is my go to, it is cooked to perfection and never dry."}
{"text":"Attended a birthday dinner last night for a friend at Bandera. Bandera is categorized on Yelp as a \"steakhouse.\" However, other than filet mignon, there is no steak on the menu. In fact, there are more fish entrees than anything else.  Admittedly, what they do, they do well. Unfortunately, what they do is very limited. Namely, a very small wine list and limited number of entree selections. Further, some of the menu items that were most in demand have been discontinued.  Ordered was: deviled eggs, the prime rib dinner with mashed potatoes, the rotisserie chicken with garlic mashed potatoes, the jalapeno cornbread and a white cake soaked in cream, topped with caramel sauce and fresh fruit . We didn't order wine because none of us saw a wine we recognized or liked. We ended up drinking beer (Fat Tire) and iced tea.  The meal was solid, but unspectacular. The five deviled eggs were good and remarkable only for the fact they appear on few other menus. The prime rib dinner ($31) was a smallish cut (approx 16 oz) for the money. The mashed potatoes (and the garlic mashed potatoes) were made from real potatoes and had chives incorporated. The rotisserie chicken dinners ordered were \"off the menu\" but the kitchen readily accommodated us. Where they were unable to accommodate us was with a former menu item, baby back ribs.  Bandera was famous for their baby back ribs. Enjoyed on previous occasions and commented favorably upon by other reviewers here, these should be a staple, like the hamburger at \"21.\" For a while, they were available \"off the menu.\" Alas, no more.  The highlight of the meal was the jalapeno cornbread. It comes in a small cast iron skillet. The crust is sweet and the interior is soft and crumbly. Combined with butter, it's by far the best item we sampled on the menu. To eat at Bandera and not order the the jalapeno cornbread is almost a wasted trip.  The white cake soaked in cream with caramel sauce and fresh fruit was excellent. Our \"Birthday Boy\" had to settle for a single candle in his dessert. The staff does not make a special to do over birthdays and anniversaries -- thank God.  The service was well above average. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. Our meals arrived at the table hot and our glasses, especially the iced teas, did not remain empty for long.   I'd like to give Bandera 3.5 stars. They would otherwise be four stars except for the small size of their prime rib and the small size of their menu. Bandera is a \"safe\" choice in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We have lived in Scottsdale for the past few years and just tried Bandera tonight.  Scottsdale is filled with great food, but we have have nothing better than Bandera.  LeAnn our waitress was terrific and we couldn't have had better food.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Pork ribs perfectly done.  Meat fell off the bones.  Cornbread best ever!  Kale salad exceptionally tasty and I've never liked kale before!  French fries thin, light and crispy.  Salmon very tasty and vegetable salad yummy.  We were so full but we are glad we had the banana cream pie.  Best we ever had.  The service was super.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best place in Scottsdale for me. Love the chicken sandwich or the salad. Which by no means is a healthy salad. But fantastic. No guilt if it says salad on the menu.   Always great service. Worth a wait on a busy night. Wish they were open for lunch. Drove down town to discover they are not."}
{"text":"Three friends and I YELPed this place while in Oldtown Scottsdale looking for a place to take a friend's dad. We saw it had good reviews and looked fairly busy and went in. They sat us quickly and I really like the ambiance and feel of the place.  Our server seemed okay in the beginning. Very knowledgeable and efficient...at first.  She got us our drinks and brought us amazing jalapeno cornbread. Then it went downhill very quickly.  First, not once did she refill our drinks.  Second, she forgot one of the meals and it took her twenty minutes to come back and figure it out!! Then it took forever to get our ticket. Then even longer to get our card back!  Service was the minus two stars of this review.  As for our food? My salad was perfection. The best of salty and sweet and crispy. Three ordered the filet and they said it was cooked perfect, the potatoes were creamy and even thought the brussel sprouts were yum! One had the Caesar and it was big and looked great. The last of us had the enchiladas and she licked the plate clean!  I'm guessing just get carryout and you'll have a five star experience?"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday - she'd been wanting to try it for awhile, and we'd never been - so I made a reservation and we went.  We were definitely not disappointed.  The ambiance was very nice, and our server was polite, attentive, and very helpful.  The house salad I started with tasted noticeably fresh and was generous in size.  My wife had a rotisserie chicken, which she really enjoyed.  I had their special for the evening, a lamb sirloin, and I was delicious.  Very flavorful, and the sides (broccoli and mashed potatoes) were tasty as well - and I'm not usually a fan of broccoli.  The evening was topped off by a birthday dessert of a banana/chocolate pie - again, delicious.  No complaints about the food, service, or ambiance.  Wish we would have found this place earlier, and we'll definitely be back.  It's risen to the top tier on our list of Scottsdale restaurants.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Scottsdale, I head over to Bandera as it a no fuss, no reservations needed restaurant. The food is consistently good and comes out fast. The service is not the best as it takes a while to place your order, but once the order has been made the food comes out quick. The skillet cornbread is amazing. Moist and flavorful. It is baked with a hard, crunchy crust and soft inside. Very nice contrast in textures. The cajun ribeye was tender. It's a decent steak, but nothing to rave about and nothing special.  However, the grilled corn on the cob was great; fresh grilled corn on the cob is always great. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Excellent service, delicious meal. A good spot for visitors or locals."}
{"text":"Great food, STELLAR service. I've probably been to Bandera a dozen times and it never disappoints. The cornbread and rotisserie chicken are the best I've ever had anywhere, and they definitely know how to cook a steak. The ribeye is super tender. The atmosphere is sort of upscale relaxed, so you feel taken care of but still casual. Only one time did we have a slight service issue at the beginning of the meal, and it wasn't that big of a deal, but they still went above and beyond all expectations to make it right and give us an awesome experience. I will absolutely keep coming back here."}
{"text":"PDSF Review:  PARKING is free, behind the restaurant.  DECOR: lights are dimmed for a classier and more mysterious feel.  SERVICE was tremendous, from the receptionist to the waitress; always checking up on me.  FOOD was super amazing.  I ordered a large cut of prime rib.  It was cooked to the exact temperature that I like.  Also, the meat itself was juicy and yummy.  I actually think this place's prime rib is better than Lawry's!!!  Great deal for just $35 at Bandera.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We made a 5pm reservation and were greeted promptly and seated. Our server was attentive and professional throughout our meal. We enjoyed the Chicken & Rib entree, Prime Rib and the Chicken Sandwich. The food was eye pleasing and just as tasty. It is always a good idea to start with their cornbread - no butter needed. It's tangy, it's sweet, it's just awesome! The restaurant fills up quickly, so if you have to wait, it is well worth it. The servers work as a team and the helped everyone seamlessly! Another great time at Bandera! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Arrived just before they opened at 5 and the door was open so we walked in.  I've been coming here for years and didn't really expect to get seated since they are always busy.  Got lucky tonight and was greeted by a super friendly welcoming bartender and we were able to have dinner there at the bar.  Drinks were great and the bartender provided great service.  I've always had the best luck with the burger just LOVE the homemade bun.    Had one issue with this visit but like any great business they make it right.  Thank you Sarah!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant... Best Kale salad ever!  Great atmosphere, wonderful staff.  When I am in Scottsdale again, I will be stopping in.  Great food!!!!"}
{"text":"Great awesome, great service, food, portions.  Made reservations, got there table was ready. We had the prime rib, excellent, too much to finish and the Kobe steak enchilada ...perfect A++++."}
{"text":"This is a great southwestern restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale.  Service is excellent.  The hostess, server, and manager were all very kind when my group came in.  We got our food incredibly quickly.  The server joked that the chefs weren't very busy, but hey, that's much better than the food taking a long time.  The food was all great.  Everything had a little bit of a kick to it, from the Dip Duo to the Carnitas Sandwich.  Nothing was outstanding, but it was definitely worth the money.  This seems like a great place for a date night or a calm night with friends. Check it out!"}
{"text":"WOW!! This place is truly a gem in Old Town Scottsdale! From the outside coming in, all you can smell is the aroma of meats on the grill - so good! The wait staff is polite and quick to serve you. I ordered the cornbread and jumbo artochokes as appetizers while out with my aunt, and both were great! I am a cornbread fanatic, and this version was delicious! It was moist but not over buttery, and had mild jalepenos inside. The artichoke was well seasoned also. For my entree, I had california sea bass, which was prepared perfectly. My sides of red and yellow peppers were also perfectly prepared, although I didn't care for the tabbouli. My aunt ordered the prime rib, and wasn't fond of the spicing and thought the meat was quite tough. When she told the waitress, she immediately asked what else she would like, no questions or comments! She replaced that with the pork ribs, and OMG they were to die for!! Also, the corn on the cobb is killer. This place two thumbs up :)(:"}
{"text":"I found it odd how identicle Bandera is to Houston (which I ate at the day before). Then snap OH they are owned by the same people.   Food:  The best corn bread I have ever eaten in my life. And I don't even like corn bread (except from here). A Must try. I ate alone (yes very lonesome) so 1 order was way too much. Best to be shared amongst 3 other people but I tell you it is a MUST try.   Chicken/Ribs combo - Chicken was moist and very well spiced. Ribs tasted deep fried! Delicious. The bbq sauce on the ribs was sweeter than I am use to but left a fairly refreshing taste in my mouth.   Service:  This is Scottsdale...service better be good! And it was.   Environment:  Dampened environment. Great for first dates or lonely dinners on your own. I highly suggest sitting at the bar if you are eating alone.   Price:  Cheaper than I remembered, but you'll probably spend at least $30 a person eating here.   Food: 5 Service: 4 Environment: 4 Price: 4"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday with colleagues while on business.  Wouldn't ordinarily order the cornbread, but followed the recommendations on Yelp and it was really good (served in an iron skillet).  In general, the food was good (one person didn't love her steak), but otherwise everything was tasty, and great margaritas."}
{"text":"Wow! What a spectacular meal and outstanding service. From the grilled artichoke, kale salad and corn bread to the ribs and salmon, everyting was bursting with flavor. One of the best meals we (myself and 4 other ladies) have ever had. Will definitely be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Just went to Scottsdale for Cactus League ball. Bandera was an oasis among mediocre tourist traps. Lovely room, waitstaff in crisp white shirts, excellent cocktails and very good prime rib. Really hit the spot."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed this trip.  We had a 7:15 reservation for 7, only to have to wait 45 minutes 'so one of the big tables could open up.'  Next we come to find out that the 'big' table only seats 6 and the 'only' chair they have for extra diners was being used.  The waitress was nice enough to point out where the extra chair was and said that once there were done we could go grab it, which we were on the moment then left the table!  I tried the 2 items they are known for, the grilled artichoke and the chicken.  The Artichoke was awesome, however the chicken did miss the mark.  Good food, not worth the hassle with a larger group..."}
{"text":"I received a call from Sarah, the new manager at Bandera.  She said my experience was unacceptable and asked me to come back to give them another try.  I was reluctant after my last experience but decided to go for my Bday.  What a difference a new manager makes!!  The food and service was excellent tonight.  I ordered the macho salad and my wife had the BBQ salmon.  She loved her meal and I was extremely happy with the macho salad.  While the dish was 25% smaller than previous visits, it was perfect.  I could never finish the salad before so a little less was fine by me.  Most importantly, the mix of ingredients was spot on.  The chicken was tender and plentiful and this time there was avocado, tomato, goat cheese, dates, corn, etc. all mixed to perfection.  I will definitely put Bandera back on my very short \"go to\" list of Restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. It's a special place for  me and the hubs. We celebrated our 5yr wedding anniversary last night and ate at Banderas... once again, the food was delicious, the wait staff friendly and the service fast. We got an appetizer, drinks and 2 main courses, our bill was $90 - also, the portions are very generous and the menu is always evolving. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant in downtown scottsdale. Low lighting makes it seem even fancier - they even put on the menu that you can't use your cell phone (broke that rule to check in). The food was outstanding! We ordered the cornbread app (sweet, crumbly goodness) and the dip duo (guac and spicy queso dip) with very few chips. They were kind enough to bring us more chips on request at no additional charge. For dinner most of us ordered the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes. Huge portions at only $17/each - pretty good deal for fine dining! Drinks were standard. Margarita was a little weak for $10 - lots of ice.  The loss of two stars is a result of terrible, grumpy service. Our waitress, Vanessa K, put on the smile, but you could tell she was really hating her job last night. I don't know why - we ordered plenty of food and drinks, you'd think she'd be excited for the tip? Not so much. She was very short spoken with our group and at no point offered to do anything for us, we constantly had to request service.   I would recommend the food, just not the service. I expect more at a fine dining location. Let's be honest, there are lots of places in that area to eat - choose one that treats you well!"}
{"text":"Great, simple food prepared amazingly well with easy service and a casual yet upscale atmosphere - I really, really like this place. My mom was visiting from Los Angeles and wanted to head to dinner in Oldtown Scottsdale. After nixing The Mission due to deafening noise level, we headed to Bandera where we had a fabulous dinner. Started with the deviled eggs (they were okay - I am not a fan of surprise celery in anything-  but needed a little more spice.) Skip these and get the skillet cornbread! I had the filet mignon with seasonal veg (broccoli) and mashed potatoes and the mom had the Loup de Mer (seabass) with marcona almonds and herbs plus veggies. The fish and steak were both perfectly cooked. We also got a couple very well balanced cocktails and the nice, unobtrusive waitress brought out additional chilled martini glasses to keep our drinks cold during dinner. I am looking forward to going back as the view of the open concept kitchen has convinced me I have to try a lot more of their menu!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: You know what, I'm changing my stars to 5 for this guy, I just like it that much, really good food, really friendly folks.  Yes, you're 5 star Bandera.  ****  Great atmosphere, great eating, great service.  I got the fillet and it was excellent, lots of butter used to make sure of that.  Oddly, my friend also ordered the fillet and 15 minutes later mine came out, and a minute after that my friend got the manager instead of the fillet.  The manager explained that they ran out of fillets (they had also been out of chicken but we knew that pre-ordering).  They apologize, took a wine off the check, and blasted a prime rib out after about 3 minutes wait (sorry person who had that snagged from the heat lamps).  Nice service save."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, they have the best burger anywhere!!  I've never been unhappy with a dish that I've eaten and the service is outstanding. You have to try this place....it's a definite must!!"}
{"text":"Was in town from Denver for the rock and roll marathon  Our hotel concierge recommended this restaurant. Our party of six arrived and the restaurant was at about 75 percent capacity. There were three large booths open and set for dinner. The hostess told us we would have to wait 45 min for a table until people were done eating. We asked about the three large booths and they said they could not seat our party unless we took two separate tables and split the group.   We asked why we couldn't be seated at the large booth and they said it was against policy to seat six people in a booth for five. It was obvious the large booth would accommodate 6 to 8 with ease, yet they continued to tell us that we would have to wait for the other smaller booth. Go figure... We know the cherry creek grill in Denver very well (I hear it's owned by the same person) and decided they clearly don't need our business at either location in future.  We found a nicer more accommodating place across the street."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places. The service is great, but the food seems to have gone down. The ribs had very little meat on them, the chicken was tasty, but not outstanding. The cornbread was outstanding."}
{"text":"I am hard pressed to give any restaurant a perfect review, but Bandera was right on point. From the wait staff, especially Brittany, Nicole and the GM, Zack, to the ambiance, to the incredible edibles, our meals were perfect. We tore through the cornbread then feasted on salmon with an amazing cucumber salad and the blackened ribeye with scrumptious mashed potatoes and seasoned broccoli. Everything was cooked to perfection. Having a chef for a son, we are no strangers to fabulous food and Bandera has fabulous food."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the money. Amazing prime rib."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my fav places  Always great service but the food and atmosphere is the best.  A must have is the cornbread and the rotisserie chicken is to die for.   I also love the prime rib dip amazing.   You won't have a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Walked by the place various times throughout the week and the smell of the chicken on the wood fire rotisserie was making me bite the air. The place was crowded but we sat at the bar and ordered some drinks and just as fast we got a table. Great view of the restaurant. I went for the chicken and I was a bit surprised at how small it was but that did not matter, It was cooked perfect and full of flavor. This was a good choice. Good food, great service a must stop."}
{"text":"Love this place! We visit Scottsdale every year and this is one of our must go places. Our favs are jalapeno cornbread, prime rib, and the roasted chicken. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Have visited this place  20 times over the last 25 years. Still good cornbread .The mesquite chicken is good, however it was GREAT 20 years ago. The potatoes are good and they were GREAT 20 years ago-with the right combo of parsley, cabbage, and onion. Somehow the flavor has changed maybe due to recipe changes. It's been 3 years and I will be returning in another month to see what's changed and will update my review accordingly. Service has never been a problem however perhaps the economy has taken it's toll on the ingredients. Can't speak for the drinks - have not ordered any there."}
{"text":"Although I checked their website before making the reservation - there was no notation regarding attire, specifically that men were not allowed to wear sleeveless shirts. The hostess suggested that we buy a souvenir t-shirt - no thanks, the sleeveless shirt my husband had on was way nicer!! Please update your website so everyone is aware of this dress code."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd year in a row we were in Scottsdale for spring training for an entire month. Bandera's is by far our favorite restaurant! ! We had 5 delicious meals during our stay and our party of 4 has had just about  everything on the menu! We have not had 1 bad experience!  Not only is the food great but the service is above and beyond! I also want to mention how accomodating the manager Sara has been. She is another reason we will continue to come back!!"}
{"text":"Have been going to this restaurant for years; however recently they no longer serve their great bloody Mary's for even a Riesling wine; the mashed potatoes years ago were far superior to what we had last night and was even disappointed in their famous rotisserie chickenYet our dinner tab was ridiculously high"}
{"text":"Great food even better ambiance. If the menu was more diverse, especially the dessert portion, this review would be even better. Will be coming back to Bandera again for sure."}
{"text":"The food at Bandera was very good.  I was with a group, and we shared a couple starters that were all delicious:  the corn bread was flavorful and beautifully presented, and the \"duo-dip\" (guacamole, and a cheese-type dip) were seasoned perfectly.  For the main course, I had roast chicken and it, too, was delicious.  So, why only 3-stars???  My issue goes beyond the food and drinks, I had a very strange experience at Bandera - one that I've never had at any other restaurant.  I was with there for a business dinner, and we weren't sure if 6, 7, or 8 people would be joining us.  First, our group encountered a lot of resistance to us sitting at ANY table if we weren't exactly sure how any people would be there, despite the fact that when we arrived, the restaurant was nearly empty.  (Being fare to Bandera, they did draw a very nice crowd, just a little bit later).  We ultimately sat at a table for 7, and of course, our 8th person arrived.  Even though we made room by squeezing in - and we were ok with that - the wait staff hurried over to let us know we had to split up into two tables.  We reiterated that we were fine, but it was made clear that 8 people at this table for 7 was NOT ok..... Our business dinner ended up split between two tables.  Very odd.      Sadly for Bandera, the people at this dinner were influential local and national business leaders who dine out frequently.  After dinner, many of us commented that this restaurant did not seem to be amenable to accommodating our group, and most of us won't be returning for future business dinners.  Here's the thing:  if you go to Bandera, expect good food, but only go with a smaller group.  (And, by the way, the largest table they have seats 7, so let that be your guide)."}
{"text":"No dings on this one. Always a great time and the food is terrific. Service is friendly and personal. Drinks are generous. Perfect up scale dinner house light level - makes everyone look good. I can't think of anything I would change. The house rotisserie chickens are featured in a showcase on the south side of the building...I'm sure just to get you salivating. (Also check out their \"Flying Chicken\" - under the radar takeout via the back door. Very Cute) Not a huge menu, but lots of comfort items, great variety and consistently excellent all the way. Deviled eggs, cornbread gets a big thumbs up, and I'm a big fan of the Macho Salad. I could eat that everyday. Can't wait to go again! Soon."}
{"text":"The artichoke appetizer was dynamite. Smokey and flavorful dip. Bangers and mash were fine. Good ambience."}
{"text":"This place is busy on a Saturday night; an indication of a popular place to eat. We were hoping that the food would be the reason for groups of patrons waiting at the bar and outside the doors for a table. Thank goodness we made a reservation (highly recommend!), and the hostesses had us at our booth within 15 minutes of our reservation time.   Excellent ambiance in the restaurant was followed by fantastic service. We were also lucky that the grilled artichoke was on the menu. My vegetable adverse husband said he had never tasted anything so good.   I ordered the rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes: they were excellent from the taste to the presentation. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because of my favourite rotisserie chicken at Casa Mingo in Madrid (sorry).  I cannot wait to eat thoepic mashed potatoes again, and we will definitely return to Bandera."}
{"text":"Bandera is one of my favorite places to eat in the country. Every time I visit Arizona I find myself eating here at least 3-4 times per trip. The grilled artichoke is absolutely amazing and their steak is always cooked to perfection. Most importantly, the staff at Bandera is always incredibly welcoming and smiling."}
{"text":"Ein \"Fleischfresser Tempel\" vor dem Herrn! Das Restaurant liegt ein wenig außerhalb von Tempe in Scottsdale aber es ist jede Meile wert dorthin zu fahren. Jedes mal wenn ich in Phoenix bin muss ich dort essen gehen. Die Steaks sind für Amerikanische Verhältnisse relativ klein, aber die Qualität des Fleisches ist unfassbar. Der Service ist exzellent und der laden ist immer gerammelt voll, ohne Reservierung geht hier nicht wirklich was. Aber für was der Laden wirklich bekannt ist sind die Spareribs, WOW die werden 8h bei niedriger Temperatur gegart und sind so zart, das dass Fleisch von alleine vom Knochen abfällt sobald man ihn hochhebt und dass ist nicht übertrieben! Einfach nur der Hammer. Man sollte versuchen mit mindestens 5 Mann dorthin zugehen, weil dann bekommt man sicher eine der großen halbrunden Bänke an der linken oder rechten Seite des Restaurants, von dort hat man einen Fantastischen Blick. Ich würde alleine für die Spareribs 6 Sterne vergeben wenn ich könnte, wer die Gelegenheit hat dort essen zu gehen sollte es keinesfalls verpassen!"}
{"text":"It was good, but it wasn't as glowing as some of the reviewers led me to believe.  I ordered the cornbread, mashed potatoes, and went with the server's recommendation of mushroom meatloaf: OK.  In fact, the meatloaf wasn't hot, it was tepid.  I think the mashed potatoes had chives, parsley, and maybe dill in them.  I would have preferred good 'ole garlic mashed.  The cornbread was OK.  I think people are more wooed with the presentation: served piping hot in a small iron skillet.  But it definitely wasn't the best I've ever had.  Far from it...  Nice part of town, good ambiance, and I felt well received.  The food is good, but not great.  I might go back again, but it's not the cheapest place to give a second chance."}
{"text":"My friends and I checked this place out pre-Cinco de Mayo last night based on its pretty darn decent Yelp reviews, and I wasn't disappointed! Even my coworkers were impressed with my good-restaurant-picking-abilities in a strange town...thanks, fellow Yelpers!  Atmosphere-wise, it bears an uncanny resemblance to Houston's...and the cuisine isn't terribly different, either. Despite how busy it appeared to be, our party of 4 was seated immediately, and our waitress was super friendly...even chatted us up a little about where we were from, etc., and provided us with some good beer recommendations.  For starters we went with the Dip Duo with Tortilla Chips. The duo of dips turned out to be a pretty chunky guacamole, which was very refreshing, and some kind of queso dip...I'm not sure exactly what was in it, but it was very yummy...they also brought us more chips after we'd polished off the ones that originally came with the dips, which I appreciated. For dinner, I ended up ordering the fish special, which was a grilled cajun blue nose, which is, as our waitress kindly informed us, in the the snapper family and is a mild, flaky white fish. And it was JUST fabulous...I enjoyed every bite of it! It came with a little cucumber salad, which was just basically thickly sliced cucumbers tossed with a light dressing that had cilantro and corn in it...and some other stuff that I can't identify, but it complemented the fish wonderfully.   Obviously my meal wasn't probably the classic Bandera meal, what with the lack of steak and all, but my experience was nothing but good, so 4 stars it is! I noticed they have a Brentwood location, so I might have to check it out once I'm back home...maybe I'll give one of their steaks a try!"}
{"text":"I like Bandera. The food is upscale bar food but the presentation is good and I love the wood smoke flavor the meats have. Some of the servers are a bit uppity but in general they are very professional and quick. I will keep coming back. I love the cornbread appetizer."}
{"text":"Great food, great cocktails, fun bar. Service always good and fast. They have a really great chopped salad on the menu that I usually get. I have friends who rave about the French Dip sandwich. The artichoke appetizer when in season is delish!! My favorite thing, though - they use FRESH SQUEEZED juices for their cocktails, so I can get my greyhounds with fresh grapefruit juice, which is obviously the only way to make a proper one!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday evening with colleagues from work and we where placed very awkwardly in a booth. Not cool and we had reservations for 5.   The carnitas sandwich was very tasty but their fries are terrible. They do an ok margarita nothing to rave about.   My colleagues tried the chicken. There were no remarks of delight during the meal or the ride home about the food so I will surmise that it was average.   Go to Blanco it's is much better."}
{"text":"Rotisserie chicken and prime rib is excellent. It is a must. Plus they have pretty good selection of wine"}
{"text":"a GREAT place with a warm, friendly , classy atmosphere.   the lighting is perfect.....Bandera gets it!!     definitely a cool, but un-pretentious vibe  they deliver in the food & drink department .     all of the mention of the rotisserie chicken & corn bread is right on the money.   everything i have tried has been savory & delicious.  on of my favorites in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The problem with Bandera is everyone waits at the bar prior to getting seated. Well how is that a problem you might ask since that is normal everywhere else...the problem is that they order their meal, are half-way through it and then move to their tables when called upon instead of finishing their meal at the bar. That's a problem because those of us waiting for tables can't get drinks at the bar since the bartenders ignore you unless you are seated at the bar. We waited nearly 45 minutes for a table standing around. The bartenders ignored you and it was impossible getting a drink.   The food was good but overrated. I ordered the por ribs and the meat fell off the bone. The fries were terrible and burnt little crisps..think of it like stale pringles... The service was polite and friendly yet not outstanding.  A good restaurant for the Phoenix area but a lot of hype. This restaurant caters to the 40-60 year old White local Scottsdale crowd. I definitely recommend arriving before 7 PM and after 9 PM on the weekends otherwise you will wait 45 minutes for a table standing around without a drink."}
{"text":"Poor Management!!! I wish I would have read the other reviews before eating at Bandera tonight. I was a long time fan and I'm still a big fan of Hillstone on Camelback. But will not go back to Bandera until I'm notified the manager \"Mark Poltntan\" is no longer employed by Hillstone."}
{"text":"Went to Bandara tonight.  We ordered the prime rib and it camr our RARE,  very rare. We sent it back and guess what they stuck it under the salimander.  How embarrasing.  I confronted the manager and he wasnt very happy.  We re ordered  and on the third try it was rare but not as much.  I have seen a drop in quality over the past year."}
{"text":"Stunning staff and food!   No matter how many times I dine here...its a LOT...I find I want to yell from the rooftops for everyone to come here. They have their grilled artichokes right now,  which is reason alone to celebrate! Megan W is the best server we have ever had! She is super attentive and always so fun to see! The macho salad is my \"go to\" and while they used to not have pomegranate martini's,  asking for them often enough will make them be ready for your requests. This is a \"must visit\" when you are in Scottsdale. This former Chicagoan is just so grateful to be able to still enjoy their food!"}
{"text":"I haven't been there in 5yrs and I may not be going back. The chicken, the side and the not so good butter nut squash sauce was yuck. It's definitely not worth $17. It shows because on a Saturday night there wasn't a long wait. They changed something that was once good"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to get home and yelp this place. Five stars, too!  After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago, I hadn't been to Bandera until tonight. WOW! It was a GREAT experience!!!  We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous!  Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries.  Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage!  The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY!  I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top! Next time, I'll take some pictures (if I'm not too hungry)...  I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean... REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about this place before going and I brought my mom here while she was visiting.  I was amazed at how busy it was for just a Monday night so it seemed promising.  The rating says it all just A-OK.  Most of the food seriously lacked flavor.  My boyfriend actually really loved the ribs.  I had the grilled trout-unmemorable.  My mom had the ribs & chicken with the green rice all of it was pretty boring.  I doubt I'll go back unless my boyfriend forces me to so he can have the Texas ribs again."}
{"text":"Had a 7pm reservation but they made a mistake and made reservation night prior.  They have had us wait over 1 hour for their mistake and still not seated!"}
{"text":"Lots of reviews for Bandera, so I'll keep it simple.  If you like cornbread, you have to try theirs! But schedule time for the gym the next day...trust me on this one!    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here for my brother in-laws birthday. Ordered the chicken sandwich and was incredibly pleased! My mother in-law ordered ribs and was brought out the chicken and rib combo. They took it back and took her rib meal off the bill. To me, that is extraordinary service. It's hard to find customer service like this these days and Bandera's needs to be recognized!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious!  My husband and I went this past weekend with friends.  We started off with the cornbread and artichoke appetizers.  the cornbread is to die for!  Hands down the best corn bread I've ever had with little jalapeño bits to add just a little spiciness.  I had the Tuna as my entrée and was not disappointed.  For dessert we had the oreo cookie sandwiches.  Amazing!  I left feel stuffed but satisfied.  It was worth ever calorie.  =)         Also, my husband didn't order any wine but our friends who are total \"wine-os\" informed us that they barely mark up their wines.  Awesome food.  Awesome Deal!"}
{"text":"It was good...but thats about it...wasn't great or outstanding...Didn't wow me..for the prices I want Wow :)"}
{"text":"About four years ago I was watching best thing I ever ate, on the food network. This restaurant came up for their banana cream pie. My first visit I got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and of course the banana cream pie. Went last night got the rotisserie chicken and rib combo.Man I forgot how delicious this places."}
{"text":"This restaurant is class! All the way elegant, food made fresh, and picture-perfect presentation! You must start with the cornbread! Then pick anything off the menu - you won't be disappointed! Our servers were extremely friendly and professional.  Depending on what night and time - make a reservation - otherwise it could be a long wait. Solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is part of Houston's though it is smaller, and much more intimate. The menu is very limited, but the dishes are amazing and the service is outstanding.  Last time I visited I had the burger, which was excellently seasoned, and cooked perfectly. The visit before that I had the filet, with mashed potatoes, which was also to die for.  Each time we have arrived through the back entrance which takes you through the kitchen, the staff is so welcoming and hospitable even though we are walking through their workspace.   Amazing place for a grown-up outing or an intimate date."}
{"text":"Bandera has a simple menu, and really solid food.  They do not have a happy hour, and you may want to make reservations if you plan on dining after 7pm. But overall the food is good, but don't expect a changing menu. Their focus is on a chicken they roast, and cornbread and mash potatoes. I would say the style is comfort food with culinary flare. Don't get me wrong the food is awesome. Although my boyfriend would disagree I LOVE their vegetable platter with fun, seemingly farm fresh vegetables charred to perfection. Their macaroni and cheese, appetizer of skillet cornbread and half-chicken come recommended.   Drinks are of higher price, but the atmosphere makes up for it. EXCELLENT service, definitely a highlight of the Bandera experience. This place is perfect for date night or when you're just looking for a yummy, solid dinner with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"OMG! Went tonight and the baby back ribs were not on the menu!! They still made them for us but said they will be \"phasing them out\". Please mister manager or corporate person re-think this. If you take the ribs off the menu my wife won't want to go as often!! You are gonna lose customers!!  Save the Baby Backs!!"}
{"text":"Decent.  Used to be one of our regular bike night stops several years ago.  A small bribe could get you a quick table back then but HOG parking had to be at Myron's place down the street.    I still prefer Houston's for my bistecca and anything else American."}
{"text":"I had some clients in town and someone suggested Banderas. I had never been there so thought we would give it a try. Call them around noon and made a reservation at 7:15 pm for 9 people. A couple of the people in our party had gone to the Waste Management Open that day but the rest of us went to the restaurant directly from work. We arrived around 6:45 and had a beer while we waited for our table which was finally ready around 730pm. At that time they informed us that they could not accept parties larger than 5 or 6 and they would  be sitting us a two different tables. We asked if they could just push two tables together and we were told no!   The hostess sat the first table of 4 and then came back for the rest of us a few minutes later. She asked where the rest of our party was in which I said that they were all seated or outside on the phone and that they could go ahead and seat us. The hostess refused to seat us and said that she needed to make sure we only sat 5 people at our table. That was the sole reason she wouldnt go ahead and seat us. She could not trust that we would sit 5 person per table. Frustrated and upset I informed her that were were all business professional adults and know how to count, that we would sit the correct amount of people per table. She finally sat us.  The waitress brought us waters and asked if we wanted anything, at that time we ordered apps. She came back later while I was in the middle of a conversation with one of my clients and when I didn't acknowledge her right away I noticed she stormed off with nasty look on her face. About 10 minutes later, she returned and asked if we were ready to order, we said yes, the first question was from my wife who asked what the house soup was, in which she said \"we don't have one\" in a rude way. One of my clients tried to order the grilled artichokes which is highlighted on the menu as a specialty, the waitress said \" we are out of that too\" so he picked something else. I ordered last and asked for the house special French Dip, she replied \"Oh we are out of that too.\" It took me a minute to find another dish as the menu was not to my liking.   A few minutes later after the waitress left I commented to the table about the bad service from her. I clearly pointed out the fact that she was rude, did not talk to the table about any restaurant specials or inform us what the kitchen was out of, I told the table she was not very good at her job. While I was talking about her i did not realize she was at a server station behind me, listening the whole time. About 5 mins later she returned to the table to bring silverware, my wife asked if she could have another Margarita. At that time the waitress informed us that she was cutting off the whole table, I informed her politely that all most of us where on our first or second drink. (One of my clients had been to the PHX Open that day and was buzzed but very quiet). She reiterated that we were cut off. I replied that I would like to see the manager. When the manager came I calmly explained to her the whole experience, situation and fact that the server cut us off because I made a comment that she was a bad waitress, that she was merely being vindictive and retaliatory because of my comment and while the manager understood she did support her server by stating   \"I am not going to go against my server.\" In the same breath, she looked at my wife and said I'm sure we can get you another margarita, (because we were not intoxicated) but it never came.  Based on this incredibly poor experience I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Food, décor, service are all good - cornbread is awesome.  Wish they were open for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"We have been to Bandera quite a few times over the years since moving to the valley.  Service is always great.  Food is consistent and fairly good.    Over the years the prices are consistently increasing and portion sizes getting smaller.  Went Friday night and ordered the rotisserie chicken dinner.  $17 for chicken and a side of slaw! My wife ordered the grilled salmon.  Unspectacular and with over abundance of black pepper.  Nothing I couldn't cook myself on the grill at home.  Probably have trouble making the fancy grill marks :-)  Unlikely I will make a return visit."}
{"text":"After spending a week in Scottsdale, Bandera was perhaps the highlight for dinner! If you plan on coming here, take the time to make a reservation. We did and it paid off. We started with the grilled artichoke with lemon aioli dipping sauce (phenomenal). She got the bangers and mash and I got the rotisserie chicken. Presentation was nice, speed was excellent and taste was amazing!   Drinks were good, with a suitable selection and to top it off, the banana cream pie was delicious!   Overall, great service and food! This place gets busy and it's easy to see why. If you okay spending a little bit more, it's well worth the price...every bite of it..."}
{"text":"Dined here last night for the first time in years.  The staff was scary friendly and very attentive.  The food was as good as I remembered but now they offer a tortilla sauce over the chicken.  We opted for the sauce on the side (good call) and really enjoyed dinner.  $17 for a 1/2 a chicken seemed pricey, but not overtly so.  I am glad to see they are still in business and wish them many more years of success.  Cornbread was awesome too."}
{"text":"We've been there a few times now, and the food and service has been wonderful each time.  Great location, parking is never a problem and a solid menu.  Can't go wrong when treating out of town friends or celebrating a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is a great quote once in a while \"special occasion\" type of restaurant. The ambience and atmosphere are great, but the food is extremely expensive. I recommend the double \"duo\" dip appetizer which is delicious, but at $9.00 you cant help but notice how small it is.  My main course was the pork ribs special. These were incredibly delicious, but they were served with fries that are so thin you cannot grasp them with a fork and you cannot dip them in sauce with your fingers because they are so small they will get stuck in the sauce. Plus, this entrée was $28, and struck me as more of a $17 at best entrée. At $28, you truly are left feeling like you should have received more of something.  Trying to impress that special gal? This is the place to do it. This is a great first date restaurant, or a special occasion restaurant. But chances are I would never become a regular at this place due to their prices."}
{"text":"I made my first trip to Bandera a week ago or so. Actually I forgot I'd been there until I saw Gabi's review. I wasn't particularly hungry when we stopped in for a late dinner before Nathan's surprise party, so my meal consisted of a few sides. We started with the obligatory cornbread skillet which everyone raves about...I wasn't crazy about it. I love the idea: cheese, cornbread and green chiles, but it was WAAAAY sweet for me. I definitely expected something more savory and cheesy, but the sweet corn over-powered everything else.   My 'meal' was the side house salad and a side of mac and cheese. I make really awesome m&c so I wasn't uber impressed with bandera's version but it was good nonetheless. The 'nice little house salad' was indulgent, my favorite part by far. Well-dressed, ribboned lettuces and cabbages, with I think 1/12th of an avocado and a tablespoon of goat cheese and a few other bits and pieces tossed in.   Our server was pleasant, service in general was quick and we were seated right away too, which was surprising on a Saturday night around 9pm. I would go back if someone suggested it."}
{"text":"The food was all right. The cornbread was terrific. The prime rib was great. The broccoli was under cooked with a weird flavor. The mashed potatoes were a little weird. The tri-tip steak was overcooked big time but when I complained they replaced it no questions asked. They had like 6 options for drinks (non-alcohol), 10 entrées, 3 deserts . I wouldn't say the customer service was the friendliest... they were just there  Overall I'd never waste my here except stopping to pick up corn bread."}
{"text":"We ate here recently over the weekend while visiting from Dallas.  The ambience was nice but a bit noisy.  We got the chips and dip and cornbread for appetizers.  The chips and dip was solid but the cornbread was slap yo mama good.  They do individual cokes with no free refills which is a joke. Two of us got the burgers and honesty I've had a better burger at Wendy's. It was poo. One of us got the rotisserie chicken which was excellent , but still one other got the steak and it was meh. Some positives overall but honestly it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Best salad I have ever had. Rotisserie chicken, avocado, goat cheese. Favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Early dinner equaled getting a table quickly!  Great cornbread, salad and ribs. Excellent service, busy environment, open kitchen for entertainment aspect."}
{"text":"We always come here for special occasions, one of my daughter's was visiting and we thought she would enjoy it . We started off with our usual cornbread and Margarita's, that was delicious. They were out of their famous grilled artichoke's !! She had the salmon which came with mashed potatoes and cucumber salad. It was a large portion and she saved half for the next day. She really enjoyed it. I had the macho salad with was delicious, I also saved half. My husband had the prime rib dip sandwich. Which disappeared pretty fast! lol. Can't wait til the next time. This restaurant was in the Scottsdale magazine this month on The Guide list of restaurants !!"}
{"text":"Sooo I went here with a friend who is well...older...than me. As soon as I waked through the door people were staring at me like I was a sugarbaby. Looking around it didn't seem so uncommon. It didn't help that my friend decided to squeeze into my side of the booth. The bartender nearly chocked when I ordered a glass of wine and took a look at my ID. Anyways....never really into the whole scottsdale scene.  The wine suggestion was superb and service was great. Cornbread was ok didn't live up to the hype. I got the salmon and it was tasty. All in all just didn't live up to the hype. Oh well...good place to bring a sugardaddy lol. Just Kidding!"}
{"text":"With Ra Next door, I think this is restaurant alley.  Bandera came as a recommendation and the prices were not too bad.  25 for some pretty good prime rib isn't too bad especially when you can expense it.  The wait time was about 10 minutes, but I can really see how this place can be super crowded on weekends.    I didn't try the chicken, but the other 3 folks who ordered it enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Dinner at Banderas today was awesome. I had the Prime Rib. I ordered it rare and they served it perfect. My wife and daughter had the French Dip and thought it was great also. Our server Kylie was great. She answered all my menu questions helping make the perfect choices. I would definitely go back to Banderas."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! Had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. We were quickly greeted and asked for our drink order. No less than 4 different servers waited on us, delivering drinks, appetizer order, serving, dinner order, taking our payment. They never left you waiting and were always pleasant. The food was great, although a little spicy. I like hot food, but you need something to temper the heat a little during the meal. The pork carnitas were great, my wife had the butternut squash and white cheddar enchiladas. Fantastic! The deviled egg appetizer was also a pleasant surprise. I wish I would have had room for the banana cream pie, it looked delicious. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Tonights vacation dinner destination was Bandera, located in Old Town Scottsdale. We heard lots of good reviews for Bandera, and were excited to try it. Bandera is also a sister restaurant to Houstons and The Rutherford Grill (both 5-star ratings from me).  We got there about a half hour earlier than our reserved time, and enjoyed a drink and the Deviled Egg app on the patio. Our table was ready in no time. We ordered the Grilled Artichoke and Cornbread sides...the artichoke was fantastic. The cornbread was the best I've ever had. For my main course, I ordered the Steak and Enchilada. The 6oz filet was sliced into three small pieces and had a maroon spicy sauce on the side. The enchilada had their signature rotisserie chicken inside. Both were tasty.  The wifey had the Macho Salad. The salad arrived and for whatever reason, it was missing the rotisserie chicken. They quickly corrected it, and she enjoyed it quite a bit.  I liked Bandera, but it was a touch off. Maybe it has something to do with the Mexican fusion? Good, but not as good as their sister restaurants. 4-stars."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fabulous restaurant! We were greeted with big smiles as we walked in the door. 20 minute wait on Friday night was great. Cocktails were wonderful...Bartender knew what he was doing.  Our Server was fabulous. Big smile, good sense of humor and anxious to make us happy. We tried Prime Rib (outstanding), Steak with Enchilada (also outstanding) and two enchiladas (wonderful). We all had the Mexican cucumber salad with our entrees and it was delightful. The enchiladas had a savory sauce unlike I had had before it was fantastic.  Service was outstanding... water always filled, cocktails refreshed, check-in often and very personable.  We'll be back again soon! I can HIGHLY recommend Bandera...You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Not too crowded for a Tuesday evening. I went in to have a drink at the bar with a friend. The beverage was good and strong! Quiet, dim atmosphere. The barista was pleasant as far as fulfilling the drink orders, not very sociable though. Great place to take a date. I will definitely go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Good definitely, great...harder to say. The chicken was great, the ribs good, mashed potatoes very good, cole slaw good, tomatoes with blue cheese good, cornbread good though with  butter it would have been better.   The wine list is ok.  The martinis good. Service was very good, not only our excellent waitress but hostess impressed us too. The open windows on a cool evening were not good.  There was a lot of noise.  Parking was satisfactory by Old Town standards. It is in an interesting neighborhood.  Price was fair by local standards."}
{"text":"WOW! My fiance and I stumbled across this place after being completely ignored at the adjacent sushi restaurant and I can't even begin to explain how pleasantly surprised we were! This place was absolutely amazing!   The service was superb (bar and servers). The food was delicious as well!! We witnessed five different parties ask to meet the chef to compliment him, and we were number six! This was two years ago and we still remember this amazing dining experience.   We're sooo excited to go to Scottsdale for spring training this year and this will be our first stop! I hope it's as good as I remember. Oh, the cornbread croutons were to die for! I've been trying to mimic that recipe ever since!"}
{"text":"Amy helped us on our visit and she was excellent. Not only that but the food could not have been better. Thanks to the chefs and farm fresh ingredients. We ordered the cornbread, filet and kale chicken salad. Wow. Wow. Wow. :)))))))"}
{"text":"I pride myself as a locavore and to think it's only been since 2008 where I've become much more attuned to supporting local eats and drinks. Bandera altho a chain and part of the Houston's brand is one of those chains that I will frequent because they are worth it.  For some odd reason I like my 3s and if I were to recommend 3 items on their menu ok wait 4... but the main 3 are the Green Chile Cornbread Skillet, the Bandera Cheeseburger and the Roast Chicken. These menu items are foods that must be tried because they're good. The cornbread skillet is crumbly, moist, and simply good. It easily serves at least 3 people but the center comes out drier so ask for some extra butter in order to moisten it a little bit. The Roast Chicken is half a chicken and served with green rice (the fourth recommended item) which is divine. The Roasted Chicken is moist, and the flavors of the chicken is scrumptious. And last, the Bandera Cheeseburger which must be cooked medium but it's not served on the usual two buns, not it's like a long bun split in 3, so it comes out like large sized sliders. Along with the shoestring fries and that my foodsters is one of the best cheeseburgers on the old town drag. LOVE it! Bandera's is perfect for date nights, friend night outs, and family dinners. It's a nice laid out place with good service and totally recommend dining there. deuces!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new.  This was the only restaurant busy on a Tuesday night at 730.  I figured it must be good if people are willing to wait instead of going to eat elsewhere.  I asked the server what their secret is.  She said good food, good prices and good service.  She described it perfectly.  While I am not usually into chain restaurants, I was pleased with the food, prices and service.  The BBQ salmon was good. The cornbread is a must try, as is the mashed potatoes.  It is also fun to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Okay, please try the macho salad! The Macho salad is great, if you enjoy huge chunks of avocado and fresh ingredients this is a must try. We ordered two more entrees, the steak which was excellent. The salmon, was not to my liking. The salmon had a sweet glaze that I did not enjoy but was cooked nicely. Service was wonderful, on point. Menu is great, the items were priced well for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Great meal quick service.  We ordered the cornbread. It is amazing the crunchy top was addictive I just wanted to keep eating that and then I discovered they super moist bread.   The macho salad was seriously yummy. The hothouse tomatoes were cut in half and actually tasted like a tomato rather ham tasteless red balls. The croutons were made from the corn bread   The ribs and chicken were excellent. The BBQ sauce was not overpowering tart vinegar taste. The smokey taste hit the palate a few seconds after the sweet sauce taste.  My only disappointment was The banana cream pie.   The crust was a fine the filling was sad. It was like a very soft banana pudding poured into a pie. The bananas were in chunks on the side. The presentation was great but the taste very ordinary  The salad will Always bring me back"}
{"text":"I dined in this establishment earlier today and was totally disgusted by the quality of the food. The fact that I found a living cockroach on my table. I guess that's about the quality of the food. Good luck if you choose to dine here and watch out for the bugs."}
{"text":"Wow - everything we had here was really good.  The skillet cornbread was delicious. My husband had the burger and said it was one of the best he's had.  I had the Carnitas Sandwich and it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had - amazing.   They make everything in house - even the bun.  The sandwich was really creative and super delish.   I can't wait to go back and have it again!"}
{"text":"Had the artichoke hearts as an appetizer and it was great.  Very tender and seasoned just right. I had the trout and it was a generous portion with vegetables as the side. My coworkers ordered Banana pie for dessert and they said it was excellent, but I'm not a big banana fan so I didn't try any.  Great location in the Old Town part of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just left Bandera where I had the most awful experience with a manager in my 40 years of restaurant dining. Due to a malfunction with THEIR machine our credit cards were denied 5 times, each a different card. On the spot in the restaurant  I called AMX and was told the had NO record of our cards  ( my husband's and mine) even being attempted to be used. We had a huge credit line and no late charges. At home we called Chase and we're told that no attempt was made to use that card either.  The manager was arrogant and did not even listen when we told him what American Express told us.   AMX said it was an error with their server or their machine.  He was very rude and condescending. He insisted it was us. On a last attempt our card went through. No apology. No attempt to make it right. Not even a cup of coffee!  Went next door for ice cream and the card was fine!   A new manager  is desperately needed !"}
{"text":"The last time I was at Bandera OJ Simpson was being chased down an LA freeway, so it was time to revisit this downtown Scottsdale favorite. A friend took me for my birthday, and I was surprisingly let down. The place really is too stiff for a rotisserie (as a fellow poster noted), and I think the prices are exceedingly high for mid-level food. Portions were small, and the staff was a little too formal for my taste. I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant!  I usually don't care much for \"chain\" restaurants but this is by far, one of my favorite places to eat!  And I appreciate the consistency between both Sacramento and Scottsdale locations...the 2 where I've dined.    The grilled artichokes are fabulous and nobody makes a better lemon drop!!!!"}
{"text":"We ate there last evening. I was really looking forward to an evening out with my husband. The service was horrible. Our waitress was rude and she could barely be bothered to take out order. She did not make eye contact with us once. In addition the food (macho salad) was mediocre and overpriced!"}
{"text":"If we could give a 6 star we would. Had Ruby as our server who was delightful! So attentive and personable. For starters we had the deviled eggs which were awesome, then the smoked salmon..highly recommend, best I have ever had. Wife had cheeseburger. Came with Cole slaw and spicy fries. If it's going to be this good, we may be back every night. Thank you Ruby for cleaning up my spilt beer!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants in old town Scottsdale.  Service here is exceptional and the food is to die for.  There are restaurants that boast about having the best of some sort of dish and this place has the best rotisserie chicken I have ever had.  Still have not had a dish here I disliked on the menu so that's saying a lot.   You may expect to have a wait for you snowbirds during those times of the year.  However, the wait is well worth it.  The staff if is on point all across the floor and some of the best I have seen!   5 stars to the staff and chefs that prepare some of the best home cooking plates in Scottsdale!  Also, hats off to the wait staff for providing exceptional service at all times.    Also, ask about dishes that you do not see one the menu ie, grilled artichokes!"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal and the service was 1st rate. Our waitress Meagan took care of our every need. This turned around a rough night at two other restaurants. We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Top Notch! One of my favorite places to eat and drink in Arizona. Rebecca is awesome and takes great care of you! Hungry for a well thought out menue? Its all here! Great afterwork meetup."}
{"text":"Delicious. Cool place, nice atmosphere, great service. Had the duo dip and rotisserie chicken and they were awesome. Very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"The beef brisket and pulled pork are moist, tender and most of all tasty. The BBQ sauce is tangy and understated - it allows the really good meat flavor to dominate. The slaw is unique, with an almost citrus flavor. The place is not huge, but decorated with lots of wood and leather like a smokhouse should be. The staff were pleasant and attentive.  I had a great lunch and will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Burger is monstrous with a shoe string fries like a haystack. I love the cornbread. Have the macho salad. It's not for the faint hearted. It's got a kitchen sink in it kidding. My favorite time of day is 5-7 when the sun is setting and the glass is lit up while I'm at the bar drinking a fantastic margarita. Feels like some timeless movie set."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I consider myself a picky person and rarely give 5 stars but I was impressed all around. I was visiting from Texas and a group of us decided to try this place based on recommendations. The food was perfect. Cornbread is exceptional, prime rib was the best I've had, salmon was great, and broccoli was cooked perfectly. That's all of the food I tried but everyone in the group thought the food was amazing. The service was outstanding. Kind, attentive and knowledgeable servers. I even loved their \"uniforms\" and clean, slick back hair."}
{"text":"Great place to get a drink or enjoy dinner.  Incredible jalapeño corn bread baked fresh in an iron skillet and wonderful  environment."}
{"text":"I had the Macho Salad, and it was amazing. I'm a big salad person but this one had so many flavors and everything was amazingly fresh. I wanted to order one to go! I didn't get any dressing on it however but the goat cheese created for a nice touch that I felt it didn't need any dressing. I will most definitely be back just for this."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but great things about Bandera since I moved to Old Town, and I had to try this place for myself. It was fantastic!! The service was great, we were seated right away and our server was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. We started with the artichokes and had the carnitas sandwich and steak and enchilada for our entrees. Everything was amazing, but hands down, the carnitas sandwich was my favorite. The restaurant was packed but the level of service didn't change a bit. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went there two nights ago.  The service is impeccable, a standard of perfection to which all other restaurants should aspire.  That says a great deal about the manager, doesn't it?  Seated promptly, server arrived to take our drink order within one minute after being seated.  Drinks came out promptly.  Nice selection of beers on draught and a reasonable wine list - not great, but adequate.  Server was attentive throughout the meal, although she did not ask me if I wanted another beer or if my wife wanted another Margarita.  WE would not have ordered a second drink, but the server did not know that.  One should always be asked - revenue generator.  The food is delicious and well presented.  Pricing is as follows:  my wife's salmon dish, probably about 5-6 ounces of fish, was $28, her Margarita was $12, her dessert, a cheesecake dish, was $8.  My beer was $5 and my pork sandwich was $17, I think.  I must say that the \"home cut\" fries accompanying my sandwich were a bit of a disappointment, cut very much like shoestring potatoes, very thin and short.  I prefer my fries a bit more on the meaty side.  The ambiance is quite good, very pleasant.  Although on one website the restaurant more than hints about one's cell phone etiquette, suggested elimination of baseball caps, (particularly if one has not even a modicum of couth and wears the cap backwards like an ill bred, redneck slob), and general standard of dress, I still did see some men in the restaurant with shorts and t-shirts, generally against the restaurant's published dress code.  If you are going to publish a dress code, at least have the courtesy to those of us who follow it to enforce it as your web site says you will do.  Overall I would probably go again.  Bringing children to the restaurant is also strongly discouraged -Hallelujah!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting friends in Phoenix and had dinner on a Saturday night.  The place was packed!  My friend was trying to get us a drink from the bar, when a girl went out of her way to take our order (come to find out she was a manager walking by).  Talk about excellent customer service!  Dinner was excellent - I had the prime rib which was cooked perfectly.  It came with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes; I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts, but they were awesome.  The others had the rotisserie chicken which was really juicy and favorable.  Alex was our waiter and he did an excellent job, even though the place was really hopping.  Definitely check it out - you'll be thrilled.  Oh, I forgot to mention the cornbread skillet is the best too!"}
{"text":"Really fabulous place we decided to try due to other fellow yelpers' reviews. We did not try the cornbread but did try the ribs and prime rib. Wowzies. The rib meat just fell off the bone. So tender and delicious. I had the bbq sauce on the side. The prime rib was perfect in temperature, tenderness and flavor. It also had a petite rib attached. The mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful. Coleslaw came with the ribs and broccoli with the prime rib.  All-in-all a really nice place!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrific experience. Would not recommend this place to anyone. I had a large group and attempted to call ahead for reservations. I was told I would need to come in. I then walked to the restaurant and put my name in. I was told my party would be seated in two groups of 6 in approximately an hour. They do not offer a call or beeper service so I was told to call back in a half hour check the wait time. I did as instructed and was told the wait would be 30 minutes. I had my entire group of 12 leave the bar we were at enjoying drinks immediately to ensure we were on time. When we arrived at the time we were told to arrive, I was told they could only sit us in 3 groups of 4. This was not what I was told initially and unfortunately, this did not fit our group dynamic. Rather than apologizing for the mistake, the hostess accused me of lying with her finger pointed in my face. The manager offered no solution. We waited over an hour and a half and were not ever seated. Luckily, Gramaldi's down the street is delicious and accommodating."}
{"text":"Bandera is a solid restaurant, not out of this world but very solid. It is famous for the chicken which my brother ordered and was then highly disappointed.   The line to get in was out the door for 4 nights in a row. This may have been because of spring training or maybe its like this every night, who knows.   The food is good but maybe not worth the hefty price. The menu was somewhat limited but the server was really helpful and knew it inside/out. I had the steak/enchilada combo and it was good, but seemed to be cooked before hand then preheated when ordered. The cornbread is very good but a little does go a long way.  The french fries were unique and delish. The smash hit was the oreo ice cream dessert which was truly very memorable."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and I liked the atmosphere. But for the price of the entrees - I did expect it to be better. And how can you not have mint jelly with lamb, at least as an option?  I doubt I'll ever come back for a meal, but three stars because I can see why people like it and the service was very good - and we weren't mad about waiting ten minutes for our reservation because the hostess warned us that might happen when we called ahead."}
{"text":"For a more dressed up casual and quaint place I love coming to banderas. Owned by houstons and Hillstone, it's dark inside which makes it comfortable and romantic. It's good a night out with family/friends or a date spot. Everything on the menu is really good and the service is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Went here after having heard repeated recommendations from friends and reading great reviews for quite some time. The place was packed and waiting time was among the longest I've had at any restaurant but the quality of the food and atmosphere (always a big thing for me), easily made up for it. We had the Barbecue Salmon with Spanish Rice and Escabéche.  The meal was quite pricey but that's often the case when you enjoy a few glasses of wine with your mean and that's not necessarily an issue with me as high quality restaurants like this aren't ones I visit often. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Bandera has THE best BBQ ribs I have ever had! Great food. Great service. Five start restaurant in my opinion! Want to impress a date? Take them to Bandera. Want to impress a prospective client. Take them to Bandera."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Scottsdale I used Yelp to find a good dinner stop and I was intrigued by the idea of a steakhouse with a sort of Latin twist. I had no idea that it was a chain and am only now finding out that there are a couple of locations nearer to me in California, so I'll need to see about going again. I had the prime sirloin tri tip with white cheddar enchilada and I am admittedly a sucker for enchiladas anytime anywhere, and Bandera's version was a winner. The steak was also cooked very well and the service was super-duper quick and friendly. The ambiance is noisy, but I liked it and I liked that the kitchen was open too. The drinks we had were also tasty. The prices were on the higher side, but the quality and taste of the food were worth it."}
{"text":"This has always been my one of my favorites in the Phoenix area, It had been a year or so since I'd been back to Bandera, and I'm happy to say it's as good as ever quality-wise.  The cocktail drinks were perfectly mixed and best of all, were strong (there's nothing I hate more than weak drinks!!!). We had the always tasty & fresh deviled eggs and it was great to see that they returned the Little House salad to an appetizer sized serving which is where it belongs. The staple of this place is the rotisserie chicken, and once again, it did not disappoint. The quality & quantity of the food negated the need for deserts. Although Bandera is not inexpensive, the freshness & quality of their offerings and the responsive, friendly service of the staff make it a worthwhile experience in Old Town Scottsdale. As I always say after ding at what I consider a 5-star place, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it back to Banderas to actually dine in the restaurant.  I am still dreaming of the macho salad... I think I am in love!  This salad is so good it has Roasted Chicken, Avocado, Chopped Dates and Goat Cheese... I cannot wait to come back.  Michael had their dinner special which was the mushroom meatloaf with mashed potatoes and spinach; I tried this also and it was so good.  I wish Bandera was open for lunch I would come here every week!"}
{"text":"This place made my trip to Scottsdale worth it.  The rotisserie chicken is the best I've ever had.  Cooked over a wood fire made it perfect.  Rice and skillet cornbread was awesome too.  Great wine selection.  Allie at the bar was very nice and attentative.  Everything was on point, even the music.  Appropriately priced.  Would come back to Scottsdale just to eat here."}
{"text":"I have to give 4 stars this year. Normally love this place but my husbands Ribs were disappointing, a little tough and small. My meal was great.  I had the macho salad which was good And the corn bread was awesome as usual."}
{"text":"I love this chain of restaurants, and I definitely do not like chain restaurants!  everything is good here-from the service, to the martnins, to the deviled eggs, and ALL the entrees. love it! Great atmosphere too. If you're lonely, just come sit at the bar and chat it up with some new friends."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  We have been going to Bandera's for 19 years.  Always consistent, always know it will be amazing and always know the service will be top notch!!  The food is excellent and the choices are vast.  Anytime we have out of town guests, it is usually our first choice, Bandera's never disappoints.  We live in the very north valley and it's is worth the drive!  Will be returning as long as they are there! 5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"took my dad here a few months ago i had a ribeye and he had the prime rib. freaking delicious!!! that cornbread is to DIE for! place is great, easy to park, plenty of seating, and the food is on point!!! will come back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"First restaurant I tried in Phoenix/Scottsdale area. It was really good. The layout and atmosphere went along great with the food. Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very good food and service!!! Try the honey mustard BBQ sause!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best margaritas in town! You can't go wrong with this old town Scottsdale restaurant. Try the little garden salad (delicious) or the famed whole chicken entree. Top off this fabulous meal with banana cream pie. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great steak, excellent service. I had the Tri-tip and Enchilada platter, while my friend had a chicken entree. My friend enjoyed her meal, and I loved the Tri-tip. However, I didn't enjoy the enchilada one bit, but I guess I just don't like butternut squash like I thought I did. The sauces on the enchilada were perfect though. As for the service, I couldn't ask for better. Polite, fast, friendly, and professional. I saw that a previous reviewer had a lot to complain about a specific server and a lot to brag about their rich friend and how they spent a whopping $105.80... big whoop. Gotta love the snotty \"middle-class-millionaires\" around here. Anyways, it turns out the server they're complaining about is the same server we had, Kamaili. She was excellent, and I hope we have her every time we go here in the future. She was clearly focused on making sure we were happy with our meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic place in Old Town Scottsdale...I just love the feel to this place - so relaxing and comfortable.  The servers are fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! It's setting in old town Scottsdale is awesome! I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Oh my word, thank YOU Scottsdale.  Heaven in a slice of meat & potatah! Yes, I said \"potatah!\"   YUMM. Freakin' yumm... Good 'ol meat and potatoes."}
{"text":"You know that restaurant where you go to and immediately ask yourself \"why don't I come here more often?\", well you guessed it, it's here.   Walked in and immediately was greeted by the hostess. Great first impression. Sat down and was immediately greeted by our waitress who, if the management ever reads this, Kayla was just about everything you can ask for in a waitress. Talk about someone who made our meal an \"experience\". I mentioned that it was my girlfriends first time dining there, and I promise you it won't be our last. She was fan-fricken-tastic. Her recommendations were spot on, and she did everything with a smile. Huge shoutout to Kayla!!!  I guess I should mention the food now. Ribs. Get them. Fall off the bone with a BBQ mustard sauce. My mouth is literally watering writing this. Everything was taste buds bursting quality. Topped off our dinner with their banana cream pie. Save room for this dessert. You'll thank me after.  Can't wait for our next visit. We want Kayla!"}
{"text":"Love bandera's  Excellent food service quality  Gets a bit crowded but well worth it"}
{"text":"The filet is amazing and the service is exceptional. This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix - I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times over the years and have not been disappointed. The Macho salad was delicious and the cornbread was just as good as I remember."}
{"text":"Bandera's Chicken Enchiladas have set the standard for me.  I doubt I will ever find a better mexican dish anywhere.  The mix of Green and Red enchilada sauce is Bomb.com/thebestieverhad"}
{"text":"Excellent! Ambiance is great, service is top-notch and I was promised the best french dip I ever had, and they delivered! Only downside was the portioning. The sandwich was $19.00 and large enough to feed two adults. I was dining alone and traveling, so sadly had to abandon half of it. I ate at the bar, and everything I saw come out of the kitchen, looked amazing! Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I along with our brand new baby went here Saturday night. The caliber of waitresses and waiters was superb. We were blessed to have Kylie as our waitresses. She was extremely in tune with our needs. She would walk by often just to see if we needed anything else. She was warm and friendly. She wasn't the only one - we heard a few other employees talking to other tables and they were all very professional and caring.   To make this review really stand out. I left her a huge tip. Trust me I do not leave big tips; it is rare. She truly deserved it. When I say huge tip I don't mean 30%. I'm talking more than 50%. That's how good I felt after visiting banderas.   Food: we had the rotisserie chicken and the macho salad with the chicken. We had the artichoke for an appetizer. All of the food was great!  Beer: my husband loved the frozen cups that made the beer taste fantastic!  I had to speak to the manager just to let her know I was highly impressed with her team. She explained that their hiring process was pretty intense and they want their customers to feel special so they train their employees to exceed the standards.   If you've never been to this restaurant. You must go!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Good food. Strong drinks ;) Tried the deviled eggs ;) I had the ahi tuna w a great salad.  My wife ordered the chicken and ribs combo. Ribs were great. Chicken was chicken.  The tuna was sashimi style ;)"}
{"text":"The cornbread - a must have! We had the chicken enchilada and the filet entrees. Both were outstanding. Would not hesitate to recommend, and look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in town! The menu is small but everything is cooked to perfection. The Lemon drop is amazing."}
{"text":"I have been dining here for years.  Although the food is always tasty, the portions have gotten much smaller over time and of course prices have gone up. After my last meal there the perceived value was shattered. Tiny portions of everything from chicken to potatoes and vegies. The avocado salad was kind of a joke and certainly not shareable.   I think the wine is overpriced because they serve a 4 ounce pour and at 11 bucks, a small glass of a grocery store Chardonnay is a bit much.  Service is always predictable and by that I mean fast very fast as in eat and go please. It's rarely kind and personable but at the same time never bad, because the severs are obviously trained to turn there tables professionally.  This use to be my go to restaurant in Old town, but I find myself choosing others now. I wish Bandera was great again."}
{"text":"GREAT American restaurant. Has the atmosphere of a nice steakhouse, but it's menu is much more diverse. Best appetizers: the grilled artichoke and the skillet cornbread, hands down. You get a ton of food with both. I always get the burger, and it's pretty good. The fries are really thin and crispy--so thin that I didn't think I'd like them, but I did. A lot. Their rotisserie chicken is good too--you can see the chicken roasting on the spit through one of the side windows of the restaurant. The only downfall? The water glasses are really really tiny. It isn't a huge deal, but as a big water drinker, I feel bad having my server come to refill my glass 19 times throughout my meal. Good thing the service is so nice!"}
{"text":"This was the definition of a great restaurant. I had the prime rib, which was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The service was great and would gladly go back. My only issue was the side of mashed potatoes had little to no flavor and felt they didn't belong with the wonderfully seasoned prime rib. Then the Oreo cake desert was just the perfect end to a great meal."}
{"text":"It was amazingThe waitress Anna was So amazing I loved the food especially the French dip"}
{"text":"This place is just GREAT.  Have been coming here for a many years it is very well managed, the food - all of it is in some way special even the cheeseburgers are oblong very tasty and served on matching poppy seed rolls.  The roti chicken is incredible everyone at the table ate mine.  The garlic mashed potatoes- excellent, the wilted spinach - the best I have had.  Hey it's not cheap but the beers are only $5 - oh and the complimentary french bread is prepared on the grill with the grill marks in it.   Hey and the atmosphere is warm and fuzzy even if you are with 2 kids - ( oh and they loved it too)"}
{"text":"Wow. This is all I have to say about this place. Headed down here for a early dinner. We arrived a little after 5 on a Saturday and were promptly seated. This place does seem to get busy so try to get there as early as possible if you do not want to wait.   We walked past where they were making the chicken and the smell from that alone pretty much sealed the deal as to what I was going to order. We did start off with the cornbread which was absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend getting that as an appetizer.   We all ordered the rotisserie chicken as stated and it did not disappoint. It was so juicy and tender and the sauce that they had on it was absolutely amazing. By far the best rotisserie chicken I have had in a long long time. The green rice it came in was pretty darn good as well. After we stuffed ourselves my friends dad insisted on dessert so we got the oreo with the ice cream which did not fail to disappoint as well. In all, a great meal. I would definitely recommend this for a casual dinner out with a family or even a date."}
{"text":"Very good, high quality food. I just wish they seated your party even if not everyone was there."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!    Food - Ambiance - Service - Consistency  First thing i think about when I'm in Phoenix is Bandera's.  Everything on the menu was outstanding.  This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, and our server, Leah, was awesome- very attentive, polite, and apparently a comedian in training! What an excellent experience, I highly recommend- and ask for Leah if you are lucky enough to dine when she is working!!"}
{"text":"Dip duo with double cheese is my favorite, still need to try some other menu items but so far I like this place a lot. Very professional atmosphere too which I love."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on YELP and because we needed a restaurant within walking distance of our hotel, we decided to give it a try  We had a 2 year old and a 6 week old with us. The hostess took us to a great table.  Our waitress was excellent.  We split a sandwich and an order of the corn bread.  Delicious! And plenty of food.  We watched a guy inspect every plate and we saw him send 2 back. We asked our waitress. She said he was the GM and every plate had to be perfect before it was delivered to the table.  Ours was!  We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Ceasar salad was perfect, chicken and rice was the best I have ever eaten, corn on cob with chili butter was amazing, and the homemade Oreo desert was incredible. By the way, the service was 5 star all the way. No wonder this place has a wait most every night. Wish I could eat there 8 nights a week..."}
{"text":"GREAT food, wonderful atmosphere.  I can stand outside all day and smell those rotisserie chickens!  LOVE LOVE LOVE"}
{"text":"Love this place. So many reviews, so I'll just give you my last week favorites . Grilled Artichokes are back:) and better than ever. Corn bread, no matter what kind of diet, this is worth a splurge, so good you can eat it without butter to feel better about yourself. Also anything chicken!!!!! Have a good time, see you there ."}
{"text":"Let's pretend for a moment that we're bigshots! We want huge steaks, giant glasses of wine, and beautiful waitresses serving us. It's Friday night and we're getting drunk. That's the feeling at Bandera. Excess is normal and we love it!  Bandera intends to be a serious steakhouse, but they only have three steaks on the menu. That's pretty good compared to the rest of Arizona though. I ordered the fillet mignon with spiced curry powder. Perfectly cooked to my liking (medium rare), the curry powder was balanced, providing a nice zip that vanished as soon as it was detected. The grill masters really know their stuff, as the wood fire grill provides a beautiful aromatic char.  My entree came with a gargantuan piece of broccoli, fitting the theme of excess, as well as an accompaniment of shoestring fries. The fries were thin, crispy, and dainty, being the only reminder to an outside world where things aren't always super-sized. It was a great balance to everything else that evening.   Service is gorgeous and polite. At the bar, the wait staff is a bit hectic as they need to handle two types of requests at the same time. But it's forgivable and the food more than makes up for it.  Highly recommended if you're a voracious carnivore."}
{"text":"This was an amazing restaurant! The service was the best in the world and I'm not kidding! I am definitely going back! If you haven't went go! And if you have, go back! With amazing decor beyond great service and amazing food this restaurant is stunning!h"}
{"text":"I'm thru with this place... How the mighty Bandera has fallen from grace... Having eaten here for many years I've witnessed the demise of a great restraunt faster than the fall of the Greek Empire.  Menu has changed  way to much over the years and the beef ribs which was worth traveling across the globe now, have left the building faster than Elvis... And if this was not enough the peanut coleslaw formula changed into an inedible mess... They've added parsley to the mix which has destroyed not only the flavor but the texture when u place a fork full into your mouth...  RIP"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  I love the atmosphere and the food is always on point!  You have to start with the artichokes. Delish!  They make the perfect Kettle One Martini.  I love the Macho salad.  My husband always enjoys the rotisserie chicken and beef short rib combo. We always get an order of fry's and ask for the spicy mayo to dip them in.  The kale and peanut side salad is so amazing also.  I know, Its alot of food, but we cant resist the amazing party that takes place in your mouth.  And to end the evening, no matter how full we are, we always order the decaf freshly brewed americano coffee.  Seriously the best coffee we have ever had!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband ,our son and our good freind Meghan from Michael Stars enjoyed a faboulous dinner .Stephan was incrediable server and he is soo very funny as bonus. We had devilled eggs and corn bread for appys then each of us had something different .my salmon was cooked perfect and apparnatly the barbecued chicken and beef ribs were out of this planet .The desert menue all be it smal was wel received  - al in all a very enjoyable evening highly reccomend for those wanting old town eating experience"}
{"text":"Bandera is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. I have never had a single menu item I didn't like and I've been there more times than I'd care to admit. Their cornbread is To.Die.For! Their house salad is so delicious and unique- quite a surprise. And their chicken and green rice are mouthwatering and always cooked to perfection- a combo made in heaven. Can't wait for another excuse to go back."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that the food at Bandera is always amazing. The service has always been technically sound, but also very transactional. Let's just say they're not known for making you feel all warm and fuzzy, but the food is always great so you go back.   If you want to go somewhere to spend time with friends or guests then don't come here.   Tonight my guest and I were asked to get up from our table to make room for the other reservations. I was so horrified that a manager would even come over to request such a thing. To clarify, we asked if this was a policy and she responded that yes- after 90 minutes they ask people to get up if they've finished their meal. If I'm going to spend about $80/person on dinner then I feel like I should be able to stay and enjoy my wine or cocktail.   Hillstone, Houston's, Bandera are industry stars when it comes to polished service but what the heck was that tonight?? I couldn't even believe it, I still don't think it has sunk in. I will never spend another cent at any of your restaurants and I will definitely make sure I tell people why.   1 star for you."}
{"text":"This is my favorite old-stand-by in Old Town! I have never been disappointed with the meal or service.   Best bets are Rotisserie Chicken, Ceasar Salad, Prime Rib, Skillet o' Corn Bread & Oreo dessert.   Expect a lengthy wait because...your in Old Town Scottsdale at a great restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been going to Banderas for 15 plus years in downtown Scottsdale. We went with friends for their prime rib which we love and got there early at 6 o'clock with a party of 6 all craving prime rib. When we ordered our prime rib they informed us that they had run out. What a disappointment it was only 6 p.m. so the next best thing as they said was the chicken and ribs which we all ordered. What another disappointment. The chicken was dry and cold and the ribs were overcooked. Did this company sell out?"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Phoenix to visit my friend over the past 4 years, I always want to eat here. It's excellent.  A chain? Not sure....  The cornbread and artichoke is excellent (the best artichoke my husband ever tried... keep in mind he's only eaten it with me).  The Cesar salad is excellent. I think they use the cornbread as croutons. Yummy!  The ribs are my favorite here. I haven't tried anything else because the above appetizers and ribs are too much food for me.  I would have given this place 5 stars BUT they CHANGED the peanut coleslaw recipe!!!   NOOO.......  I don't like cole slaw, but their peanut one was incredible. I would order extra sides of it, because it was so delicious.  I haven't been here for ~1 year, and the cole slaw turned into a salad kind of thing with peanuts sprinkled on top.  awful.... it was not very good.  What a disappointment. Don't know anyone who makes coleslaw like that. It was incredible. I wish it would come back...."}
{"text":"This was our 4th choice in the area and stumbled across it.  By far the best meal we have had yet!! The bbq salmon is amazing!!"}
{"text":"not my favorite bandera but i like the size and location...still no live jazz :("}
{"text":"This was my first time there, food was delicious and the service was amazing! Big shout out to Ruby who took such good care of us and went over the top for my boyfriend who was leaving the following day to fight wild fires for two weeks! An overall great experience!"}
{"text":"We frequently dine at the one in Sacramento which is close to where we live and were usually not a fan of chains but this one always makes the cut. Great energy in the restaurant. Must haves are the dip duo, skillet of corn bread, caesar salad and their martinis. We've never had a bad meal at any of them. Great service too"}
{"text":"I love to go to Bandera to start my evening off.  I've had there dinners in the past, but the most memorable food item there is their Dip Duo with Tortilla chips and their yummy Mojitos.  Bandera is a cool place to start off the night with a good appetizer and a strong drink."}
{"text":"Bandera is one of my Scottsdale favorites! It's got great ambiance and would recommend it for date night. It's almost always busy so I would recommend a reservation.  The best appetizer to start things off is the grilled artichokes. They come with the best dipping sauce! Brussels sprouts are also pretty good. For the entrees, it's hard to find anything that isn't delicious. I've had the macho salad, bangers and mash, prime rib, and rotisserie chicken...none will disappoint. They've got a great selection of wine and beers as well. I've only had dessert a couple of times but both were excellent. One was a nut crust pie and the other was creme brûlée. Great place and would highly recommend...make reservations though!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant of all time. Absolute excellent service and the food is in incredible . The rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes is the best Iv ever had. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The ambiance is top notch and the staff provided good service by being attentive.  However, I have to ding Bandera for its small portion sizes.  The food wasn't enough quantity nor high enough quality to justify the price premium."}
{"text":"A great location, great decor, ok food with high prices and just average service....use to love it but frankly, there are now many better choices."}
{"text":"We had great dinner at Bandera Saturday night.  Myself and 3 other buddies tried Bandera again.  We had ate here 10-15 years ago when it opened, and I thought it would be fun to go back and try it again.  I was really glad we made this decision.  We started with the cornbread and a rack of ribs to share between ourselves.  Now, I had been to other Hillstone restaurants and I new the cornbread would be great.  However, I had never had the ribs.  They had a good char on them and were fall off the bone tender.  They topped the ribs with a mustard BBQ sauce that was just perfect balance of sweet and savory.  I had the 'campfire' blackened ribeye.  Perfect temperature.  An interesting blackening rub gave it a sweet smokey flavor.  It needed salt and a little more 'heat' for my taste for a blackening seasoning.  My other buddies also got the rib eye or the bone in prime rib.  The prime rib looked awesome...I was a little jealous.  Two last comments:  The wine prices are more than fair...they appeared to not mark up their wine at all.  We had a bottle of the Lewis Cellars Hillstone Cab...$125.  This is what I would pay retail for it.  This was a very nice surprise.  Lastly, our server, Anna, was outstanding...dealing with our alcohol induced antics and giving us great recommendations throughout the meal.  1st class server in a great dining establishment.  The GM should be proud of what they are doing."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Service and food was amazing!!!! Cortney was the most friendly and welcoming bartender! Made my experience there unbelievable. The food was fantastic and will be coming back more often now. Thanks Courtney and Banderas for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"So my friend from Tucson said when she's in PHX she always likes to stop by at this restaurant called Bandera. She told me how good it was so I went on Yelp to do some research because I haven't heard of this place, which to me was shocking. I'm not sure how I missed this place because it's right in Old town where all the restaurants are at. O_o  So what grabbed my attention from the pictures on yelp was their Cornbread... let me just say that I LOVE good cornbread...Bandera serves their cornbread on a skillet, it came out right out of the oven, hot, fresh, crisp, and my golly it so good! (Yes, I said \"Golly\" lol...)  I could  taste the corn and jalapenos all together in my first bite. If anyone has tried ZTeja's skillet style cornbread, Bandera has got it in the bag! I just wanted to eat that as my main entree...it was that good...!)  I got the Prime Sirloin Tri-Tip and Enchilada Platter with cucumber salad (this seemed the be the popular choice on yelp). The portion was good, although it was plenty it wasn't too small or gigantic. Everything went well together, the sirloin was cooked to medium rare, the enchilada was delicious with the perfect amount of their special enchilada sauce that was drizzled on top, and their cucumber salad was refreshing! My bf got the Aged Prime Rib which is slow roasted on the bone with mashed potatoes. He was surprised on how big the rib was, it was literally the size of his hand haha! It was just way too much meat for him, if you like a lot of meat then this dish is for you!   So everyone said that they were full and had no room for dessert but I insisted on getting something! It was either between Banana Cream Pie or their homemade Oreo Cookie, they both looked so good but we choose the Banana Cream Pie with caramel and crushed chocolates to share and guess what...we all killed it!   I would definitely recommend this place. The ambiance was great, service was fantastic, food was good, check it out. =) I'll be back to try their Oreo Cookie Sandwich next time and of course their Cornbread."}
{"text":"I have the darnedest time figuring out the differences between the Hill-stone, Houston's, and this place.  Evidently some of the subtlest market positioning ever is taking place at their corporate headquarters.  Having said that, I like the place.  The cornbread is the stuff of legend, a modern day manna if you will.  Just read every other review.  Also, the way they roast their chicken is top notch.  I believe 3 of my favorite dishes there feature it.  Great American dining, even if it's hard to distinguish this place from a Houston's."}
{"text":"Okay, I went back to Bandera's after realizing that I missed out on the Cornbread skillet...and boy I am glad I did!!!!  The Cornbread Skillet was Heavenly SIN!!! Crunchy, creamy, so flavorful I am in LOVE!  My friend and I shared a few different items, and everything we had was top notch, not sure there is anything at Bandera's that isn't good. I find it hard to believe that a \"Chain\" Restaurant could have so many great dishes, but Bandera's has proven me wrong.  We also ordered the Roasted Chicken & Low Country Barbecue Beef Rib Combo with Coleslaw. The Chicken is amazingly flavorful. The Beef Ribs were fall off the bone moist. And the Coleslaw was out of this world!! Can I please have the Recipe for the Coleslaw!?!?!?  What a great Menu, not many choices but all of them great!"}
{"text":"Banderas is as good as it gets!!!!!!!!!!! As everyone I know KNOWS (lol) I am a total \"FOODIE\" And have an extensive history in food and beverage. I am in love with all phases of this restaurant-The highest level of Quality, Service, Atmosphere, Cleanliness, and The highest regard for safe food handling. There managers and staff are trained to the most professional level I have ever experienced.  They are there for YOU the customer and show you as a customer how valuable you are to their business. We appreciate you Banderas and will always be loyal grateful customers! PS If there is any question to the quality or service level being less than your expectaion, they immediately rectify the issue with authentic and genuine willingness and care!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and have always wanted to try this place out. For one, I've heard things about it and secondly I like to be able to refer my customers to restaurants nearby. However, I have to say I was very disappointed. The ambience is very nice, the service was fairly decent, but the food was terrible!! Way overpriced. I had the prime rib and thought it had no flavor to it, the raw horseradish had zero kick to it and the broccoli tasted like I was eating a tart lemon, just odd. Very disappointed!  On a side note, I work in the wine industry and thought they had an excellent wine list - which is impressive.   Overall depends what your looking for. If it's prime rib, this is definitely not the place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It is one of my wife's and my favorite date spots! The atmosphere is great! The food is AMAZING! Try the Salmon!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The atmosphere was really cool. It's dressier than I would expect from driving by. It's really busy so make a reservation. The food is worth it. Service was good. Everything we ate was great."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Bandera's star worthiness.  Ambiance is great, dark, romantic, great bar area..I could picture James Bond sipping on a cocktail at this bar and charming a Scottsdale woman back to his suite at the W before flying off to Casablanca to kill another villain..one star for that. That said, it gets packed, and can feel a bit claustrophobic.   Our server was wonderful. I think the true talent of a great server shows when they can handle big groups and are good with kids. I can't remember her name, but she deserves a shout out, star for that.    Now that I'm living with a famous health food chef/trainer I am lucky to experience what real quality food can taste like when prepared to perfection. Ill say the food was good, but not life changing here...so one star out of two for taste.   Why do they lose the other star you ask? Well it's always nice to have management stop by and ask how things are, it is an important part of customer service. We were celebrating a bday..and one of the attendees was in the two year old range. For the most part, behaving very well, but was occasionally letting out a giddy, happy scream, which can happen at this age especially with the excitement of helping open a few gifts for her mother.    There is the way right way to approach this situation as manager on duty, and a wrong way....The only time we saw management was when she approached the table and straight up told the group, \"If the child screams one more time you are going to have to leave this restaurant\"  This was after we had a half dozen appetizers on the table and waiting for our mains..Now I  certainly do not write books on the basic fundamentals of nonviolent communication, but I'm guessing this would not be in the manual.   Pissing off mamma bear is exactly the last thing you ever want to do.  A better approach may have been to start with  \"Hi guys, Im so happy everyone is having a lovely time at our establishment, happy bday, and I just would like to ask you guys to try and hold, insert name of said child here, happy screams down. The pitch is rather loud and echoing across the other tables thanks again.\"    It certainly soured the evening and I know that it may be a long time before anyone in our group gives this place any business again."}
{"text":"The burgers are SOOOOO good!!! Oh, and they do take reservations which is great for the weekends in Scottsdale. And don't forget the Oreo dessert."}
{"text":"Cornbread alone is worth the trip, but don't stop there.  Get the chicken.  Don't think of getting anything else (at least not your first time).  Just get the chicken - it's extremely moist & deliciously simple.  Rustic modern decor with a charming waitstaff complete the package.  It makes you wonder why there aren't more restaurants doing this kind of thing."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Scottsdale! It never disappoints.  Staff is always very friendly.  Drinks are great & the glasses are always cooled, which is a nice touch in this heat! Food is always superb and we have never been disappointed.  We especially love the artichoke appetizer and the rotisserie chicken is to die for.  Very tasty.  The macho salad is out of this world!  Nice and super fresh and great ingredients."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our driver and we are so glad that we took his advice!  The chicken was really maybe the best I've ever had.  It was full of flavor and so moist.  I also ordered the cornbread , which I actually took the left overs home!  ( I know, I should be embarrassed, but it was THAT good!!)    I saw a gentleman with a great looking salad  that I figured had to be a specialty salad but that was not the case, it was the house salad and it was also really good.  Our bartender was  so friendly!  I cannot remember her name but she was a local  and gave us tips on places to go when we headed to the grand canyon.  ( Jerome was awesome btw, if you read this!)  I would definitely go back if I visit here again"}
{"text":"Been in Scottsdale for less than a week and we've had to come back again to eat at this delicious restaurant. The burger here is to die for. Comes with real shoestring fries that are delicious. The artichoke and deviled eggs were also favorites.  You can tell they make all their sauces in house. We tried both desserts and they were both great but I loved the ice cream sandwich! The service was great especially our server Anna. I will definitely come back the next time we come to town!"}
{"text":"Place is real nice and the service is good but you pay a lot for average food.  Nothing to excite you except the cornbread which is a must have."}
{"text":"I really like Bandera.  I really LOVE their cornbread.  Best dang cornbread I've ever had.  I dream about it in fact.  Food is always great, service is usually great as well.  Great place to take guests if you're not sure what they like.  My only complaint...Bandera is a fairly casual restaurant, yet last time I was there my father was asked to remove his cap.  No biggie, he willingly obliged, but then I noticed the staff didn't seem to have a problem with the cute little thing wearing hers at the next table.  Come on, be consistent guys."}
{"text":"We recently visited Bandera again thinking we might just go in for cocktails and appetizers but it was not to be.  We put our name on the wait list for a table in case the bar failed to clear out which is what happened.  We also met a local who frequents Bandera multiple times per week so through him we were able to learn more about both the restaurant, it management and corporate history which is not really important for an update.  What is important is to remember to always ask if something you want is NOT on the menu.  Good example is their incredible meat loaf which I thought was long gone.  Not so according to our new friend who not only spotted it in the open kitchen but also asked our server who confirmed that it was.  I still haven't had their renowned rotisserie chicken which is a favorite of the friend who joined us for dinner.  This restaurant never ceases to amaze me and I don't think I would ever get tired of either the food, the ambience, energy and class of this place.  It may be part of a chain but it is one hell of a good chain restaurant.  Can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here on a date when i was visiting Arizona, this is quite possibly the best steak i have ever had. I ordered the filet...this steak is literally 2 inches thick, word to wise medium rare will be warm in the center. Green Rice sounds funny but taste fantastic. Bandera is pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"First time dinner. Really great service from Anna. Started with cornbread and deviled eggs. Terrific. Wife and I split the chicken and ribs. Chicken was perfectly cooked.  Ribs are beef and tasty. They come with a sweet yellow sauce.  Finished with banana cream pie. All in all, a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Terrible parking. Located in Old Town Scottsdale area. But the area is full of exciement and the beautiful people. Great atmosphere and simialar to J. Alexanders or Houstons. Could be same owner as one of them. Menu is simple. Food is medium to upper price and cocktails a little pricey but fits the atmosphere. I had chicken caesar and it was good but nothing special.Had appetizerof chips and cheese dip and quacamole dip which was good but only comes with minimum chips but they did bring more upon request. Probably wont go back but I can see why alot of people like it. 3+ sta and alot of good competition in the area."}
{"text":"This is a quiet, mellow place to have a quiet dinner with friends or your spouse. Not crazy about the staff, but they are not horrible, though. I guess, that I have experience great customer service in other places and we, as human beings, tend to compare."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food exceeded my expectations! I had the burger, medium rare. It was cooked to perfection. You don't need to do a thing to this burger. The slaw added a simple sweetness to it not to mention they bake the bun in house. I'd recommend the charred corn on the cob as a side."}
{"text":"Burger was great! I have not had a better butternut/white cheddar enchilada...service friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale for work and was told to go there by a local. So glad I did. Excellent service, great atmosphere and location. Your first time there, go with the flagship chicken & ribs combo. You will not regret it. Also, get the cornbread, even if you don't like cornbread. Trust me here. Love how the entrance actually takes you first into the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great ambiance!  Free parking garage directly across the street. Rotisserie chicken and carnitas sandwich were so yummy and the jalapeno cornbread was great also.  Attentive servers.  Be prepared to drop some dough."}
{"text":"Think of Bandera like Houston's with a Southwestern flair. Well, I mean it's owned by the owners of Houston's after all, so it's not a surprise it reminds me of Houston's.   I enjoy Bandera for dinner because it's cozy inside and filled with the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant without making it uncomfortable for customers. I like this atmosphere because we can have a nice dinner for two and be in our own element but it's not quiet either. Nothing's worse than being in a dead silent restaurant where the staff is lurking around waiting to hear your conversation.   Now moving on to the food side of the evening. I have two words: southwestern cornbread. Oh my...I could eat the entire skillet, but I contained myself and just had a corner of it. It's filled with jalapeno, and chunky corn throughout the bread. It's amazing. It's so amazing, it didn't even need butter. That's a sign of good bread. I had the crispy chicken sandwich which was delicious but ginormous.   In summary, I have Bandera on my rotation for great dinner spots when it's time to make it a night out but without making it a huge deal."}
{"text":"Service is pretty good, however they do group service and dont communicate so you often have to repeat yourself.   Atmosphere is warm and cozy. The largest table seats 5 so not good for groups. We came in with 8 and had to be seated at two different tables.   The food is good- I got the sweet potato enchilada and would get it again! The portions are not huge and shareable.   We had an issue where there were black specs in the water (maybe a filter issue?). At first we thought they were bugs but after asking for new water and getting it again, we realized it must've been the whole supply. They seemed too busy to really care or address this so unfortunately the 8 of us just went without water.   We aren't dying to go back, but would return sometime in the future because the food and atmosphere are great"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Tasty, unique menu. Great food. Great service- fast, personable, plentiful service   We had the duo dip nachos - that cheese dip is AMAZING.  We also ordered grilled artichokes as an appetizer. I had the tri tip beef & enchilada plate with a lovely chilled vegetable salad.  We also ordered the  prime rib dinner. Everything was delicious and I would recommend this place to anyone!  The i my downside was the cost.  It's not cheap ... But depending on the occasion, completely worth it."}
{"text":"Started off with the skillet cornbread and the grilled artichokes for appetizers. Both were unbelievably good. The grilled artichokes were just short of a spiritual experience! I could almost hear an angelic choir hit the high notes after my first bite.   For the main courses, we ordered the Kobe beef tips and the grilled salmon. The beef tips were the clear winner, tender, cooked to perfection, and with a nice wood-grilled flavor. The salmon was good, but the \"green rice\" that came along side of it was a little on the tangy side for me. The salmon had a sweet glaze over the top which was good, but I guess I was not in the mood for that flavor.   The bottom line is, the Yelpers were right again. This place is a winner. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great experience all around. I love the Macho salad  and grilled artichokes. Don't even hesitate for a second. Make reservations."}
{"text":"OK, I never thought I'd be giving Bandera less than 4 stars, but here I am. We visit this location every year when we are in town, and this might be our last time. Our favorites are the Macho salad and cornbread (tho ribs and chicken are outstanding as well). We had a small takeout order one night, and I was shocked at the pricetag ... $17 for my salad ... WHAT? The cornbread seemed to have shrunk as well (though still more than enough) - and it didn't taste as good as it has in years past. Maybe just our order, but on top of my million dollar salad, it added to the disappointment.  Still good food, but with price increases, there are so many other great places in the area, we will now be checking them out vs. coming here next time ...  Thanks for the memories ...."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been eating here for more than 20 years and am never disappointed! The atmosphere is so posh but mellow. It has such an elegant vibe. The Oreo dessert is one of the best desserts in town. The fresh crispy Cole slaw is bright and creamy at once."}
{"text":"Food ,atmosphere, drinks were all great everyone was super friendly . felt the wait was a little long other than that I'll be back . price ehhh fair . over all a good job"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service by Sarah, she is a class act among servers! I had seasonal vegetable plate with wilted spinach, peppers, tomatoes, delicious caramelized carrots and a grilled artichoke that picked up the smoky delicious flavor from the grill. Boyfriend had the ribs, which fell off the bone into succulent pieces of perfection. He even enjoyed the cole slaw which is a dish he usually detests! Topped it all off with banana cream pie. This pie has the perfect amount of chocolate shavings and caramel sauce all atop a walnut-Graham cracker crust. Swoon. Highly recommend and we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Rotisserie chicken was fantastic. Super juicy and great flavor. The Brussel Sprouts are a must try item, with a great aioli type sauce. When we asked the waitress what was in the sauce she immediately told us and it had about 8 different ingredients, which explains why it had such a complex flavor. Oh, also get the kale salad. Just do it. It is phenomenal with crushed cashews creating a crunchy texture and delicious flavor!  I shared two entree items with a friend so we had the rotisserie chicken and prime rib cooked medium rare. The prime rib was bone-in and was huge!  The meat against the bone was delicious, but the rest of it was pretty standard for prime rib."}
{"text":"Honestly just not that great.  The smell of the place (smokey) was amazing so I was excited to see what they would whip up.  Menu looked promising.  Then the service, and don't get me wrong this will not be another \"the service sucks so 2 stars\" review.  Not only was the service just ok, but they were out of grapefruit juice, they did not have a certain type of dressing listed and out of prime rib. The prime rib I get, but the other stuff ....amateur hour.  The server was not very attentive and did not have any energy or personality.  The food, I had the ribs and chicken combo... the ribs were WAY to dry and the sauce was, I don't even know what that was but it was not good.  The chicken was ok nothing to write home about but it was smokey which was nice.  Over just a very underwhelming experience.  If you want good smoke house or good prime rib experience go to Bootleggers across the street."}
{"text":"Jalapeno cornbread....yummmmmy.   Known for rotiserrie chicken and it is quite good and so is the rest of the menu.  I could get full on the cornbread and be fat and happy and ready to go.  There usually tends to be a wait on the weekends and last time we learned that no hats were allowed in the dining room.  A little stiff for a rotiserrie restaurant but it is still delish."}
{"text":"Hey, not every place has to be The French Laundry.  Everyone needs restaurants in their little black book that are just always a solid experience.  Bandera reminds me of Houstons (same owners?) and has a gorgeous layout and open kitchen that give the place a great energy.  Their specials are well rounded for the fish lovers, just in case someone doesn't want a big slab of moo, and their appetizers are good enough to have just as the meal.  Desserts are straight-forward and well executed.  Round that out with a decent wine list (a lot of the wines are by the glass, which is HUGE) and a full bar that knows how to do your drink and you have a bar that gets a \"solid\" rating.    It's location makes it easy to walk to quite a few other restaurants or bars and of course downtown Scottsdale and \"The Waterfront\"  are one of the best places to hang out in America for the evening."}
{"text":"Good not great.  The place reminds me of Houstons back when there was a Houston's on Camelback.  I will say however that a few things are really great.  The Mac and Cheese comes in a delicious sauce that is rich and savory.  Crunch is provided by some bread crumbs and toasted walnuts.   A different take on Mac and Cheese that didn't involve Bacon which was nice. The skillet cornbread is a must have.  Sweet, crunchy with a few corn corners.  Not too dry and just dense enough.  I almost stabbed a fellow dining companion when they didn't give me a large enough wedge. The entrees are good, but not great.  Apparently the lamb steak was cooked beautifully, but just had no seasoning.  My carnitas burger was good but didn't taste of much unless I doused it with sauce.  The french fries are super skinny and good.  The roasted chicken is a safe bet.  I think the prices are about 2 dollars over what I would pay for this type of food.  But for a nice meal in Old Town, the place really is easy to slip into, it feels a little more \"adult\" and doesn't scream I'm in Old Town, so those are huge pluses."}
{"text":"Another fantastic dining experience.  Raina was our waitress and was welcoming from the start and very helpful with the menu choices.  I had the ribeye and it was seasoned with just a hint of Cajun spices and cooked to perfection...yum!  My wife had the rotisserie chicken kale salad and our friend had the BBQ rib and chicken combo...all were excellent.  I recommend The Prisoner wine, great with many dishes.  Quickly becoming one of our favorites in Old Town!  Make a reservation,  the place is busy."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with family. The 6 of us really enjoyed our meals and we each had different dishes. We ordered a cornbread for the table that was delicious. It was sweet and savory and dissappeared quickly! Service was excellent and it was very busy. This restaurant is a solid place with a good buzz. Would recommend it, but definitely call for reservations, as it is not a very large place."}
{"text":"The rotisserie chicken was so moist and tender!  The atmosphere is comfortable and upscale.  It was busy but not too loud for a quiet conversation.  Our server was knowledgable about the menu and friendly.  Nothing about this dining experience knocked my socks off, but overall it was really good."}
{"text":"I'm going to go ahead and give this place 5 stars... it was damn good!  I seriously couldn't stop eating... and lets just say I learned my lesson about over-indulging!  I was lucky enough to be invited here by a friend who's date was very food knowledgeable.... he's been in the industry for years.  So he took the liberty of ordering for us which I don't mind at all.    For starters we had the cornbread... Delicious.  It was so crusty and yummy on top and tender with a nice crumb in the middle... it had cheese corn and peppers in it and I thought it was great... def try it!  Next we had the deviled eggs... FRESH and delicious, and I'm not a huge fan of these unless my mom or gram makes them.  These had celery in them just like my mom/grams and they were perfect.  I would order this again.  Finally we had the guacamole, also very fresh.  This had corn kernels in it as well and I just loved the texture it brought to it.  The chips were house made, and NOT GREASY AT ALL... YUM!  you should have seen the chunks of avacado in this!  Beautiful.  I ordered the filet with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Our friend recommended I order it Philly style (at least I think that's what he said) which is charred on the outside and I always order my meat rare... LOL and of course the other girls at the table had to let out their \"EEEEEEEW\"'s!  I'm not sorry, that's how I LOVE my meat, RAW :)  This was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had... Just perfectly cooked, almost purple in the middle.  Apparently their meat in the best of the best, Prime Prime, not just one Prime but TWO!  Not a drop of blood on the plate, which means they rested it.  The mash was delicious as well... and the broccoli was wonderful and buttery.  My friend ordered the ribs and they were tender and sweet and just mmmmm... if you love ribs you shouldn't pass these up!  She is not a big eater and she finished the whole slab!      I almost ate all of it I'm such a pig.  I just couldn't stop eating!  But I did save room for one or two bites of the banana cream pie (my favorite!) the table shared... and it was great... I would've eaten more but I was STUFFED to the gills!  They also ordered this oreo ice cream dessert but I simply couldn't fit in another bite.  I almost forgot... I had two (the second one was ordered for me against my will) lemon drop martini's and they were very delicious but VERY strong... jeez I didn't know what hit me!  I tasted my friends' Cosmo and it was very good as well... apparently they are famous for these two cocktails.  I would go back here every week if I could!!!  Its just that good.  I'll be thinking about this meal for a while!"}
{"text":"So glad to have discovered this place on our trip to Spring Training! Come to find out it's in the same restaurant group as one of our favorite CA restaurants (Rutherford Grill).    Food - Amazingly delicious Service - both times we visited during this one trip the service was top notch   Highly recommend reservations unless you don't mind waiting. Even if you have to wait it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best food I have had in a longggg time. Service was great, staff was friendly. Used the open table feature and we had a nice quiet booth waiting for us upon arrival (even though they were rather busy).  Price is okay, but you get what you pay for here.   Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Guys, get the cornbread skillet!! It is so awesome and the most memorable thing about a meal that was already great! We ate half as a starter along with the nice little house salad, and took the rest to go (ended up as a nice dessert later that night.   Also for dinner, we had the chicken, which was moist and tender, and the butternut squash enchilada, which came with a spicy glaze and was just unique and delicious! My companion says the enchilada was the highlight. Both were great and came with a tasty green chile rice.  Overall experience was great, too. We had early dinner reservations (5pm Saturday) prior to our evening plans and were seated promptly. Others without reservations seemed to be seated no problem either, though the place seemed to be getting pretty full. The wood fired menu options, tasty food, and great service made this one a winner!"}
{"text":"Everything is good but it's too pricey.   I had their signature rotisserie chicken. It's very good but I only got two legs and a large glob of mashed potatoes; $19 for that. The chicken was wonderful but for that price I could have so much more and almost as good at Pollo Loco.   The cornbread is outstanding. Draft beer selection was not impressive.   The restaurant has a very nice neighborhood restaurant ambiance.  If I ever go back I might try their wood fired beef ribs because they look tantalizing."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service and the atmosphere was not so good. The roasted chicken and beef ribs were excellent but I give this place a 3 star because the service was not good and the people that were there were drunk or just liked to stare at other people."}
{"text":"There are way to many amazing places to go to Bandera.  When calling in to make a reservation I was informed \"they don't do that\" when asked what their corkage fee was.  The place had a normal busy Saturday night crowd but it seemed there staff was not trained for that.  We had multiple servers where we had to ask for menu's, silverware, drinks & plates. At one point even stopping a cook.  The food was ehh and no I would not go back.  Because like I said before there are way to many amazing places in the valley to go here."}
{"text":"Experience started off awesome! The margarita was fresh squeezed and delicious . We got there early and decided to eat at the bar. We have been to Bandera's many times and  enjoy the entire experience.  We had the opportunity to talk to the General Manager Sarah. You can be sure they care about their customers! We look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I came to Bandera for a double date, and overall we had a pretty pleasant experience.  I booked a reservation for 6:00 on a Saturday night.  When we arrived we had to wait 20 minutes before we were seated, even though we had a reservation.  That was a bit annoying.  Once we were seated everything went well.  The service was friendly but our server was a bit awkward. The food really was very impressive.  The cornbread was made fresh and had incredible texture and taste.  All of us sampled each others plates and agreed that everything was really great.    I like Bandera but feel like they are a bit overpriced; I'll probably come again but only for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We are big fans of the stone hill group of restaurants.  Bandera had great food, however the staff was a bit rushed compared to other establishments.  Typically the service is so much better.  It could have been that it was a Friday evening and there was a long wait.  I would avoid this location during busy times."}
{"text":"Wow. I don't know what the heck happened to Bandera. This has been our absolute favorite restaurant for many years and we've always raved about the prime rib to everyone. We took some friends out for dinner for a special occasion and arrived there early since it's usually busy on Saturday nights. We were surprised to find that it was not busy at all and we were seated right away. We ordered at 6pm and 30 minutes later the server came back to apologize that they only had one prime rib left (all 4 of us ordered the prime rib). That has never happened to us before and we usually go for much later dinners. So disappointing. But we ordered rib-eyes instead. 15 minutes later they came back to say they were out of rib-eyes as well. When we finally got meals well over an hour after we ordered, my prime rib was WAY over cooked. I ordered it medium and it was definitely well done but since it was the last one there was nothing that could be done. They offered to bring me another dish but I didn't want to wait any longer. The prime rib was also tiny compared to what they used to serve. I would write this one night off as a fluke but they replaced their AMAZING mashed potatoes with a pathetic little smear of what seemed like mashed potatoes out of a box. I gave this review 2 stars because the server and manager were very gracious and comped most of our bill. I don't know what changed but I will really miss the flawless food and service of the old Bandera. I guess all things must come to an end. Sad."}
{"text":"I went to Bandera when I first moved to AZ a few times and enjoyed it... and then a few years passed and I didn't really think about it.  But then all of a sudden, Bandera was on my mind.  I needed to go back!  Perhaps I was craving that cornbread or that warm atmosphere that I remembered, but for the past few weeks, I've been suggesting Bandera to whomever I'm eating with so I could return.  I saw Bandera at Noche De Gourmet, and that just put it in my head even more.  So finally, this past Sunday night, I convinced my dining companions to go to Bandera!  It was around 7:30pm... it was me, Jared, my parents, and Joan M (my mother-in-law).  We'd all worked up an appetite watching my brother complete in IronmanAZ.  We arrived at Bandera and luckily, there was no wait.  I ordered the cornbread and grilled artichoke as appetizers for the table.  A few of us enjoyed a bottle of wine.  Our server was really sweet although perhaps a bit annoyed when my dad attempted to special order the sides that came with his fish.  My mom had the meatloaf, I had the Macho Salad, J had the rotisserie chicken, and Joan had a Caesar Salad and side of brussel sprouts.  While I really enjoyed the appetizers and wine, my meal was not all that... On the menu, the Macho Salad is described \"with Roasted Chicken, Avocado, Chopped Almonds and Goat Cheese.\" I ordered it without the almonds but it had some other surprises in there as well including cornbread croutons and dates.  Don't get me wrong - i like those things but I also like to know ahead of time what I'm getting!  The salad was huge and could've easily fed two of us.  Everyone else seemed satisfied with their meals.  I know a lot of people compare Bandera to Houston's (and they are both under the Hillstone Restaurant Group umbrella), but I have to say, I think the food at Houston's is much better!  I will no longer be craving Bandera's food... but perhaps I'll return for just their cornbread!"}
{"text":"I've never been to the California location but I've actually been to Houston's many times which is owned by the same company my only complaint was I ordered a hamburger medium well and it came out medium rare they did take it off the bill but honestly by that point I just really wasn't hungry anymore I also ordered their cornbread and I don't feel it was as good as the other places that I've had it I think it must have been made to because literally it came to our table within minutes of ordering it and it wasn't really that hot all in all it was still on my birthday dinner from my girlfriend the manager came out and apologize for my hamburger and offered us dessert and then charges for it what do you do"}
{"text":"I just ate at the Scottsdale Bandera. The cornbread and artichokes were superlative. My chicken was wet, pink, and bloody in the middle. I'm home now praying I don't get salmonella."}
{"text":"Love this place. Need to review though because I feel it has gone down hill. I have been coming to AZ yearly for 12 years and always come here. The food and atmosphere are top notch, but if an broke don't fix it. Recipes going down hill when changed.  Also, first time with two small children at the restaurant and it's not very child friendly for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"The food is so good. Even when you're full you keep eating. The chicken and ribs come right off the bone.   I've been here easily 10 times and am not disappointed yet. Definitely recommend the jalapeño cornbread, Brussels sprouts, and the cold avocado/cauliflower salad.   The fresh made lemonade at the bar is bomb too. It's legit almost so sour and not enough sweet.    Xoxox  Fiona"}
{"text":"We called for reservations but were told the earliest would be 8:00.  Since we had not eaten lunch and our body clocks were 2 hours ahead we knew we couldn't wait that long.  We were told we could come and walk in and see what happened. Decided to take a chance and am I ever glad we did.  Upon arrival we went straight to a table.  Anna was our server and guided us well!  We were delighted that the grilled artichoke appetizer was available.  Delectable...savored every delicious bite.  Husband ordered mushroom meatloaf which was generous.  I had the BBQ salmon, cucumber salad and substituted braised red cabbage with goat cheese for the mashed potatoes.  I can't remember the last time we had such a wonderful and different meal.  We ordered their banana pie to go.  When our bill came they had comped the appetizer since it was our first time there and our first artichokes.  The service was outstanding as was the food and the ambience.  What a Tuesday treat we will long remember!  Special is an understatement."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great place in Scottsdale, with amazing service and more than amazing food you definitely need to check out Banderas! I have never eaten the same thing twice and have loved every single thing I've had! I have on the other hand frequently ordered the mi sueno wine, which is UNBELIEVABLE.  The team there is just BEYOND top notch, I can't say enough about Ana who was just the sweetest most attentive waitress. My girlfriends and I will take off from Chandler for an evening out at  Banderas every chance we get. It's worth every single penny and then some. The quality of everything that comes to your table is unvelieable. Compliments to the chef and team!"}
{"text":"We went to Bandera last night.  We have been to Bandera many times over the years and had always been very pleased.  Last night, though everything about our opinions changed.  From the moment we received our Duo Dip appetizer our meals were terrible. The Duo Dip portions were barely enough for one person, let alone enough to share!   We ordered the rotisserie chicken like we always do.  Last night the chicken portions were so small we were wondering where they found such small pieces!   In addition to the small pieces, they did not even taste fresh.  They tasted more like old chicken  that had been reheated.  They have also started putting some kind of spicy pepper sauce on the chicken, which totally destroys the flavor!   Needless to say, we don't be going back to Bandera anytime soon!"}
{"text":"We heard great things about Bandera, and had to try it.  I have to say, the pork ribs outdid the chicken (although it was very tender and tasty).  Our source said the meat would fall off the bones, and it did!  You must order the cornbread, but expect it to be a little on the sweet side.  We loved all the sides, and the oreo ice cream sandwiches were fantastic.  We had a reservation, but did have to wait another 15 minutes, which was a bummer.  The staff was very professional and pleasant, and they accommodated our 11-month old with no hesitation."}
{"text":"Fun intimate environment and delicious food! Would recommend the deviled eggs and skillet cornbread for starters and the rotisserie chicken is so moist and yummy!! Perfectly seasoned! Salmon is also good and so is the enchilada dish!"}
{"text":"Made our annual pilgrimage to Banderas last night and was not disappointed. Getting there when they open at 5, which is the key to no wait for a table, allowed us to be seated immediately. Service was good & food was great. Artichokes, cornbread & margaritas are musts!"}
{"text":"After watching the most amazing sunset at South Mountain Summit I headed back to Scottsdale and stopped here for dinner. Sat at the bar and had a ice cold beer served in an ice cold glass. The butternut and white cheese enchiladas were absolutely amazing and the cucumber salad that accompanies it was very refreshing. Vanessa the bartender was very attentive. It was a perfect end to a perfect evening!!"}
{"text":"Let's start out with the positive. Yes, the food is amazing! Ok...that's it. DO NOT bring your kids here. I'm in town from Orange County for a girls weekend with my 2 daughters and mother. The fact that there's NO kids menu WAS the problem until the server had the audacity to bring my 5 year old a scorching hot plate, sit it right in front of her without...I don't know...a THOUGHT...or common sense absolutely blows my mind. My mom went to move it quickly, burning her hand. The server then had an amazing thought to send her less than stellar manager over who let the first thing out of her mouth be \"I didn't know the plate was for a child\" again common sense or even clear thought processing was lacking! Needless to say, our entire meal was comped (thank you) but not before I made sure to make the manager aware that she's very lucky it was my mother (sorry love ya mom) and not my 5 year old who burned her hand or it would've been MUCH more than a comped meal."}
{"text":"I would be a regular at bandera if we lived in Scottsdale!  The food was excellent and the environment was great.  Just the right amount of busy and activity on a Tuesday night.   We shared the cornbread and salad and they were good.  The rib and chicken platter exceeded my expectations.  The ribs had a sauce that took them to the next level and the chicken is not your grocery rotisserie!  It was so flavorful and moist.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and light.  We shared the banana creme pie.  Every bite was better than the next.  The portions are generous so perfect to share or take home and great value for the price.  All of the above and 3 beers and 2 margaritas was $100."}
{"text":"Great all around restaurant. Food was amazing, service amazing. Very well run. Artichoke and cornbread out of this world"}
{"text":"Great dinner with my brother, his wife and son.  We received excellent service from Emilee.  She provided descriptions of the menu that were spot on.  The front end manager Leli stopped by and made sure that everything was up to Hillstone quality.  We started with the cooked artichoke for a table app that was delicious and more than enough for our party.  Entrees included ribs, ribeye, bangers and mash, and a hamburger.  The ribs were meaty, tender, and juicy.  For desert we ordered the Oreo ice cream sandwiches and banana cream pie.  The desserts  were made from scratch and not to be missed.  Bandera is now on the top of my list while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Very rude management .  Temperature is in the 50's. Came in with my fiancé to have dinner and was told that you could sit at the bar but not at the dining room in a fairly empty Resturant because he was wearing a beanie and they had a dress code that said men could not wear hats. The bar and restaurant are all in the same area and not separated. This chain has lost it's mind . Between me and my fiancé we were probably wearing a half a million dollars in jewelry not trying to be pretentious but we eat out 6 nights a week and they lost a good customer."}
{"text":"Good food, long. wait even with reservations,  What's the point in making reservations if I have to wait for an hour to get in???"}
{"text":"Great place to have a nice meal, in a great atmosphere with the significant other, or a group of friends. Visited on New Years Eve and had a great experience. Party of 8 on New Years Eve is no small job, but they got us sat in 30 minutes and the service was consistent with the busy vibe. Everyone enjoyed their selections and even when my food came out late, they were quick to comp the entire meal. Now thats what I call customer service.  Been here  a few times and will be back."}
{"text":"There's not too many places that compliments each other from the facility to the services music and attention to detail.  And then comes the food pretty amazing. VERY GOOD JOB!!!!"}
{"text":"We eat at Bandera just about every time we are in Scottsdale - I had the ribs for the first time last night and they were so good I'd go back tonight just to have them again.  Had the kale salad along with it - it was a perfect combo - so delicious! The service is always consistently good and I love the atmosphere - dark and comfy."}
{"text":"The beef ribs are to die for!! Prisoner wine by the glass was fair price.  French dip is always on point.  Kale salad was yummy.  Ribs, ribs just get the ribs!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER EVER!! they make everything at the restaurant so it's fresh and delicious!! the show strong fries are crispy and thin! the service is excellent and the vibe is rockin!! definitely try the artichoke when it's in season!"}
{"text":"This was a well run restaurant with delicious food and top notch service. I just wish I had been more adventurous when ordering. I played it safe with Chicken when I should have gone for the Lamb."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of hungry guys after the Jackson Barrett car show. Throwing down the booze, eating a ton of food and chatting the night away. They've got a great selection of liquor and that includes my Malibu. Thank you!!  We got a corner booth on a Saturday night (9ish) with no reservation... although we did have to wait about 20 minutes for whatever reason.   Started with the obligatory cornbread. Ya. It's good... and really filling especially when you order a slab of meat for the entree. They know how to cook a medium rare which is always good in my book.   Decor is dark and old Hollywood with a modern flair. Kind of like you are having some clandestine affair-type meeting place. I dig it!"}
{"text":"Tonight I had an excellent meal at Bandera.The jalapeo queso dip appetizer was quite tasty.  My rotisserie chicken sandwich was the best chicken sandwich I've ever eaten. The chicken was tender, the cheese was melted yet still flavorful and the bun complemented the flavors as opposed to just being filler.  It was my first time visiting the restaurant and I was unaware that it was part of a chain. I think that speaks volumes about the establishment right there. I'm rating Bandera four stars instead of five because the prices were rather high for the size of the portions. That being said, the portions were what I would call \"a good size\" compared to say, Claim Jumper which has portions that are too large. Further, I think that Bandera could use a larger selection of beers and mixed drinks.   Bandera was packed, something that surprised me for a Thursday night, and while I was able to get a table for two almost immediately, the background din made it difficult to hold a conversation or even clearly hear the server. I enjoyed the darker candle and track-lighting lit atmosphere, but it might be a turn off for some.  I'm definitely going back to Bandera, but next time I'll be prepared and not wear a ball cap, as they aren't allowed in the dining room. ;-)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Bandera.  The restaurant actually took reservations, which was nice since we had a party of 6.  We approximately 15 minutes before getting seated.  I had the rib and chicken combo.  The chicken was slightly overcooked, which I have found is a common problem.  The ribs were tasty but definitely no where near real smoked ribs like you would get in Memphis.  Overall the service was great, the atmosphere nice and the food good."}
{"text":"Great Service every time I'm in her thanks to my server Serena. There's  always a line to get in but it's well worth the wait"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service.  I can always count on the macho salad AND the chicken and ribs combo dinner for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I've been to Hillstone, Houston's, Rutherford Grill, Los Altos grill and now Bandera. Consistently great service everywhere, including this location. Pretty much everything on the menu is solid. Nothing mind blowing, but it's a very reliable upscale dinner spot. Highly recommend the smoked salmon appetizer. Make sure to swap out your sides if you don't like what your main course comes with. The wine list is fantastic too with very little price markup (compare to Total Wine prices to get an idea). Hillstone group is the Lexus of \"chain\" restaurants."}
{"text":"What a great intimate place for a date night or dinner with a few friends. Bandera is a small cozy establishment with a bustling crowd. I'm not sure, but I didn't see any big tables to accommodate more a bigger group (8+). All the booths on the side seem like they were meant to hold 6 people max. Anyways, the place we actually ended up sitting in the bar area b/c a spot opened up fairly quick after we got a few cocktails. (20mins at opposed to waiting for 40 mins for a table).   The drinks we got were strong and pretty good. I wouldn't say it's a place to go for cocktails since I've had better ones at speakeasy type bars. However, they do have a pretty good and unique in house selection of cocktails like the alcoholic tea.   The food was amazing. This was the best part of coming to Bandera. We started off with the skillet cornbread which was sweet, savory, and had the right texture. Will definitely recommend it to anyone coming here. Then we shared the enchiladas and the macho salad with rotisserie chicken. Both are very very good as well. Portions are huge too, so sharing is encouraged.   The service i thought was top notch. Everyone was very friendly and the food came out super fast! I was almost surprised by how fast the food was coming out and they were all at the right temperature and no undercooked dishes.   Overall, i would love to go back and try out different items.   Tip would be to make a reservation if possible since there is a huge crowd waiting outside and most times the wait could be 40+ if not longer. Or you can just wait around the bar and wait for a spot to open up!"}
{"text":"What great food & service. Started with Corn Bread & grilled Artichoke.  Corn Bread is out of this world. Grilled Salmon was melt in your mouth, served with Mash Potatoes and Broccoli.  Could not ask for a better meal. Wife had Flying Tuna platter  - words cannot describe the flavors.  Must Try.  Ask for Megan as your waitress. She was just awesome."}
{"text":"This is my go to place in old town Scottsdale. Everything on the menu is going well. My favorites or smoke salmon appetizer, the enchilada, and the cornbread.The staff is amazing, he's always very consistent and very good"}
{"text":"Like every HRG restaurant that I've been too, this one lives up to the high standard that Hillstone has set.  With a more southwestern feel but the traditional high quality and short menu, Bandera does not disappoint.    The outdoor chicken rotisserie is an awesome touch to the already classy decor and the center focus bar makes one heck of a signature margarita.  The wine list literally doesn't have any bad choices on it especially when paired with their duo dip.  When in Scottsdale this is a stop worth making...twice."}
{"text":"Never dissapointed here, best cornbread. Houstons and Bandera's is THE place to go for artichokes, the best, mesquite grilled. Chicken is excellent. Artichokes were out of season on a recent visit, but generally available and were on our last recent visit."}
{"text":"I don't feel like I use the word \"succulent\" often enough in day-to-day conversation. I use it to describe Bandera.   First off, I didn't even know it was a chain. And I say to that, whatever, it's a damn fine chain from what I can tell, so keep it up Bandera!  Last time I was here I had the salmon special and it was delicious, while my girlfriend nibbled on a salad that she was so-so about. The appetizers are good and the service was pleasant, and I will have to wait to try a dessert till next time. Which hopefully is soon."}
{"text":"Best dinner night In Scottsdale. Sat at the bar and witnessed the true art of mixology! Watched over the kitchen, perfection of sending out the dishes, garnished and wiped down plate edges.  Most impressed"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and attentive staff. Yet after finding this restaurant under \"Steakhouses\" I was disappointed to learn that there was only one on the menu--for $29!  A little pricey....Also surprised that a prime dip wasn't on the menu. The wine list was limited and quite pricey, although the tempranillo was perfectly smooth and very addicting.    The crispy cornbread was excellent and the Bandera chicken sandwich was delectable. The roasted peppers I had as a side were a bit oily for my liking.   I'll definitely be back. The atmosphere is perfect for anything from a date to a family dinner, drinks or even a solo meal at the bar."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Old Town. When I first moved to Scottsdale, I ate here every night as I was staying in a hotel right in Old Town. The waitstaff and the bartenders are all so friendly, they make you feel right at home. Whenever my friends came to visit me, it was always our first stop after I picked them up at the airport. I love, love, love their grilled artichoke appetizer! I think it is one of the best in town and is served with their delicious creamy dipping sauce.  Their rotisserie chicken is delicious and my favorite entree on their menu is their grilled bbq salmon which is cooked perfectly tender and melts in your mouth!  Their mashed potatoes are also excellent and served with chives, and their corn bread is also delicious!  If you have room for desert, their banana cream pie is heavenly!"}
{"text":"Is this the best restaurant in Olde Town?  Maybe.  Great service, beautiful ambience.  Great place for a date.  Rotiserrie chicken with the rice is my favorite dish. It is just so damm good.  Not over expensive either.  Great deserts as well.  Guys who read this take a date their.  You wont be sorry."}
{"text":"Our server Sarah Jean was fantastic. She spent the right amount of time explaining the menu. She took our starters order and then let us enjoy. Upgraded our wine and then ordered our entrees. Perfect service. Will be back."}
{"text":"The Ahi Tuna is best tuna we have ever had!! Cooked to perfection and the dressing on the greens was perfect! Rotisserie chicken is excellent! And the green rice was a great pairing. The service was excellent as well. Our 20 minute wait ended up being less than 10. Excellent cocktails. I would recommend this place for a nice evening out with friends, date night, or just for drinks. Everyone down to the kitchen staff was out together!"}
{"text":"I love their food but their soda system is ridiculous.  When everyone is giving unlimited refills they decide to charge you $2.50 for each little 8 oz bottle of coke.  I don't drink so i love to have a coke with my dinner. The waitress tried to make it sound better by telling us the bottles were cute and we could save them as a souvenir.  Well I don't think people going to Banderas are the type  to display coke bottles in their living room.  So I spent 10 bucks on soda that night.  Even at $3 a soda they are making bank.  I think they are trying to be trendy and different but this just ends up being stupid.  Talk about being out of touch they probably still use a typewriter to type the menu.  Save some money and aggravation and go to Roaring Fork where they will refill your coke all day long for one reasonable price."}
{"text":"Just a fun place to dine. We asked if the chef could prepare us a chicken enchilada since it was no longer on the menu. Not a problem. That's the way a restaurant should handle a customer request. To have an experience with the locals, dine at the bar.  Unfortunately this accommodation has now changed as of 5/122017..so Banderas has lost our business..for the sake of making a simple chicken enchilada. Bye bye."}
{"text":"I've dined here 4 times in the last 12 months. Service and quality of food was consistently high each time. My last experience was 2/18. Our seats were back by the open kitchen. We placed our orders after watching the 6 chefs prepare meals. The lamb entree and the pork ribs entree were the best of the four entree's we ordered...I called in reservations 10 minutes before our arrival. I was told that there were 2 open tables, but when I got there, there were no open tables. Our wait was 15 minutes (or one cocktail)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was amazing! The service and food was incredible and even with a large party everything was quick and efficient. The servers were very nice and welcoming.   As a meal I had the chicken and rib combo and it was delicious! The ribs were super tender and so was the chicken. I did not finish the whole chicken but what I had was great. In addition, the appetizers were really good as well. The skillet cornbread was fabulous and the dip duo was great too. After all of this food we still had desert and it was super good as well. I loved the banana dish but the homemade Oreo ice cream sandwich was amazing!   After my experience here when I come back to Scottsdale I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"We walked by this place several times and the out rotisserie had me sold. Our last night in Scottsdale and this was our choice. the place was packed and the crowd was having a good time. We were seated in under 10 minutes and scored a booth overlooking the whole place. I got the chicken and rib plate. Now I was expecting 1/2 a bird and a half slab. Umm. Not! First off there is no steroid use on anything they serve. So the leg and breast that I got were junior size. Delicious and juicy, but small. The two ribs were in a mustard sauce, but the meat was dry. Brussel sprouts were not all that. And I am a fan when they are done right. The banana cream pie was over the top delicious. It had chocolate between the graham cracker and the cream pie. The service was outstanding and the atmosphere made the night."}
{"text":"My in laws chose this place to have dinner and when I looked up their menu they didn't have a kids menu. The website also said they weren't kid friendly. So I called and sure enough, no high chair and no kids menu, but I didn't want to be rude and change the venue.   The waitress came over and asked if we were ready for drinks and asked if she could put I an order of fries or a banana for our child. We don't even get that kind of service at restaurants that welcome children. We usually have to wrestle with our 2 year old until everyone's main course comes."}
{"text":"I will Forever LOVE this place! Every time I have people in town I always take them here. The food is to die for and the service is impeccable. I highly recommend going here for any occasion! Some things could get pricey but totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place is the best place I've eaten out of all the times I've visited the Phoenix area. My friends took me here when I was visiting last weekend and I really hope we go back next time I'm in town! The cornbread was amazingly delicious with the jalapenos inside and caramelized top. I split the chicken, green rice, and cucumber salad with one of my friends and the other ordered the ribs. Of course we all sampled each others meals. The ribs are without a doubt the best I've ever had and I would make that my standard order as the meat literally falls off the bone before you bite into it! The chicken was great, but not really covered in bbq sauce; it was moist and came off the bone easily. Rice was great and something I've never heard of before; I forget what was in it exactly, but I think it was cilantro or something similar. Cucumber salad was fantastic with it's cucumber, avocado, corn, greek olives, fresh feta cheese and peppers. I had a really great glass of Riesling from a German winery; wish I could remember which one it was, but it was very smooth. The waitstaff was fast and courteous. I love that there is a dress code for guys as it adds to the classiness of this place."}
{"text":"My husband said the Carnita sandwich was the best sandwich he's had in a LONG time."}
{"text":"what a great place. there were 4 of us and we all have something different. the ribs just melted off the bones. my wife had the filet and it just melted in your mouth. she had the special mashed potatoes, don't remember what they were called but she really enjoyed them.another party had salmon and it looked great. the son from OR had the meat loaf and it really left a lot to be desired. sort of dry and not much taste. The B 4 drinks were good  and near the hi end of pricing,but hey its Scottsdale. This was our first visit and it will not be our last. Just a long drive from Surprise. don't forget the corn bread and request butter. A great meal would be a large salad and the corn bread."}
{"text":"Yes I know the food is good but when they tell you the wait is 45 minutes and you're over 200% wrong (and we're still waiting) it completely ruins our experience."}
{"text":"Here is the breakdown. Fresh squeezed oj and goose, the salmon , and the filet! This is all you need. The sides are awesome too. I'm not going to say I have never had a crappy server here, but that happens anywhere at times. I will give 5 stars for the quality of the food and the reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"This is one of the best, most consistent restaurants in Scottsdale. I am a foodie who loves small independent-owned restaurants but there are always exceptions. This place is one of them. Don't follow the recomendations of the rest of the herd posting here though. The chicken is probably the last thing I would order on this menu. Not that it's bad. It's actually quite good. It's just that it doesn't compare to the rest of the items on the menu. Bandera has the best Filet Mignon I have ever had. They put a worcestire & chive filet butter on top that is out of this world. There beef ribs are also the best that I have ever had. They are meaty and tender and the barbecue sauce is out of this world. Other recomendations include the barbecue salmon (or any fish that they are offering), the sliced leg of lamb, the burger (delish!)and of course the cornbread. The service is always good as well. Bandera is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale and it I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Chicken and cilantro lime rice is perfection. It's a big portion (half a chicken) so if you feel like sharing definitely order all white meat ($2 extra) and an extra side of rice . We weren't able to finish our plates . Cucumber salad is so good and I was excited to try the artichokes but they didn't have any that night . Overall delicious meal ."}
{"text":"Great food! Their sandwiches were amazing and the corn bread was to die for! Would definitely recommend Bandera to a friends. Went there for Valentines Day and the atmosphere was lively and fun. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer that I pretty much love all Hillstone Restaurant Group establishments.  They are consistently good.  I have been to the Bandera in Brentwood (Los Angeles) and love it. This place is no different-- same set-up, same great food.  The only difference is that this location is laidback. Whereas the Hillstone restaurants in L.A. required a lot of getting ready beforehand, Bandera in Scottsdale was still upscale, but with less high maintenace-looking people.    I had the prime rib and it was ah-mazing *cue angelic chorus*.  I tried both the creamy and fresh horseradish with it and prefer the fresh one. The mashed potatoes were also pretty bomb-a-licious.  I paired it with The Rule cab sauvignon.  I was so consumed into my food that I forgot to try my boyfriend's ribs dinner.  I did try the salad and it was also solid. We shared the Oreo cookies with ice cream for the dessert and enjoyed it.  Perfect meal.  We actually explored going to a more local joint prior to deciding upon Bandera. But because we were both craving meat and wanted something we knew we would enjoy, we went to Bandera.  And it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Almost a five-r, but the service seemed a bit odd. The space is dimly lit for both intimate and casual encounters.  Plenty of seating available, however large parties may be separated due to layout. The meal was delicious and the sample of a drink plus my beer was great. They missed the five mark for me because of the robot-like service. Also for the no cellphone comment on the menu. I'd still come back, but maybe sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a few times and I absolutely love it.  The first time I went I was with a group and as not sure what to expect and it was always a pleasure to dine here.  The Grilled Artichokes are amazing.  If you had to start anything and get a feel for what to expect this sets a great foundation.  The entrees are focused on the savory proteins but thats what I'd expect from an American themed restaurant.  The service is always top notch.  Professional, precise, informative and quiet.  Simply put its like ninja's with water jugs because everytime I'd look my glass as always full!  Honestly I love that.  Great atmosphere for a business dinner or formal quiet celebration.  Drink selection is accomodating for any taste and I'm always a return diner at any time of the year."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend the Carolina style ribs. They are so tender- meat falls off the bones. The mustard bbq sauce is to die for. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Two words: Dip Duo. This is the main reason I keep returning to Bandera. This appetizer comes with guacamole and cheese dip and definitely should not be skipped. Another top rated appetizer is the cornbread - it comes in a skillet and is baked perfectly. I had the Seared Ahi Tuna. It was seated to perfection and features nice, light flavors. Don't expect to be stuffed after this dish, it is filling though (especially after the dip duo and cornbread). The other dishes that were ordered were the salmon and the chicken sandwich. Both of these dishes received raving reviews - not a bad word to say about either (hard to come by when you're in a group!)  This restaurant has a very lively ambiance and is always packed during Spring Training. I recommend making a reservation. However, do not be surprised when you have to wait ~10 minutes for a table. If you find yourself in Scottsdale, I would suggest it for your short list."}
{"text":"Hilstone restaurants do a great job normally and wished I could hand out 5 stars except my food just didn't cut it temperature wise. Flavors and quality of product was spot on but serving the food on a room temperature plate left me somewhat disappointed. Go take some notes from the manager at Rutherford Grill where every visit I have had there makes 5 stars. Unfortunately I won't be rushing back for room temperature food."}
{"text":"After an afternoon at the pool I really wanted a nice dinner at a place with ambiance. I came to Bandera, a nice booth and looked at the menu. Almost everything looked delicious. I did order the Prime rib which was beyond expectation. Salty crispy outside and a juicy (medium) inside. The mashed potatoes were so flavorful. I loved the main dish and ended up with Oreo Sandwiches for desert.  My dinner was lovely."}
{"text":"I love Bandera. I was there on Sunday for a birthday dinner with some friends and I left asking my wife: \"Why don't we come here more?\"  Bandera is part of Hillstone, so it is like Houstons in a way. I prefer Bandera due to the smaller, seasonal menu and the smaller, more intimate feel to the restaurant. On Sunday, I had the ribs, my wife had the lamb (a special item that night), and both were delicious. The table got the cornbread to start (amazing), and we finished with their banana cream pie (UH-Mazing). The rest of the sides, salads and entrees that we ordered were very good as well.   Every time I've been there the service has been spot on, the cocktails are good and the food is consistently great. I'll probably end up here again within a week or two.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We went here yesterday for our anniversary and we were so happy we picked this place. Since the moment we walked in, service was wonderful. Unfortunately I can't remember my waitress's name, but she was one of the best waitress we've had in a while. Food was brought out immediately and was incredibly tasty, corn bread is great! Our fave dish was the BBQ Salmon. Great place for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali. Decided to try it on a recommendation from a friend . We were seated way faster than we expected . We were estimated 80 minutes and we only waited about 1/2 hr. The service was great. Attentive without being pesky . The drinks were very good . Husband had the prime rib and he loved it . Huge portions. I had the emerald kale and chicken salad . It was also very good . The artichokes were sublime . And the cornbread is a must have . We would surely recommend this establishment and return when in town next time ."}
{"text":"Went here last week on a date with my boyfriend, it was his first time and about my millionth, lol! Was instantly wowed by their outstanding greeters and servers! My every need was taken care of right away. I had a very attentive blonde female server! She was quick to take our drink order and made sure we had all the appetizers we could possibly need and suggested a really yummy one!(the deviled eggs, which to my surprise were absolutely delicious!) I also ate the chicken sandwich which is my norm and always so delightful! One thing that has always made me a little uneasy is the attire they dress their employees in. I am a personal shopper for Nordstrom and wish I could just get in their and dress these individuals. The white button up shirts and sherrif's badges scream olive garden/farm attire to me. If there is anything I could tell Bandera as to why they only got 4 stars is their clothing choices. Overall wonderful eats!"}
{"text":"Great experience and delicious food. We randomly stopped by after work and were treated extremely well even with a bit of a crowd gathering to watch the football game at the bar. One of my coworkers was skeptical but ended up loving his meal."}
{"text":"My father's friend recommended Bandera as a dining location during our family's pilgrimage to Scottsdale. It's a popular restaurant - when we called up at 5:00pm to make a same-day reservation, the earliest available table was at 9:15pm. We decided to wait for a table instead, and were seated in about 45 minutes.  A quick perusal of the menu told me that it was a Hillstone-owned restaurant: there's the \"macho salad\", a butternut and cheddar enchilada, homemade Oreo sandwich, etc. This was a bit disappointing as I've dined at a couple of Hillstones elsewhere and was hoping for a more original dining experience. But since we were there, we ordered:  Grilled Artichoke (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#NXGmm9uLQ9DrIYJSSJffMw): 4/5 Who doesn't love a nicely-grilled vegetable? This was nice and crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside, and served with a good remoulade dip. They serve this at every Houston's and is an appetizer I'll always order.  Skillet Cornbread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#sd27YFMBnR2nFa0P4FY2og): 2.5/5 Another Houston's staple. There is much less cornmeal in this than in most versions of cornbread, and it's quite heavy on the butter. This combination makes for a heavy, non-cakey cornbread, which I actually prefer but will leave traditionalists a bit disappointed. You'll find corn kernels and jalapenos baked into it.  Crispy Chicken Sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#p25rQpHnyaxrdxQu8feqXQ): 1.5/5 I had this at Honor Bar in Beverly Hills and LOVED it. Unfortunately, this was quite disappointing. The chicken breast was flavorless in addition to being fried too long so that the overly-crispy batter was falling off. There wasn't enough moisture in the sandwich overall to combat a heavy-tasting bread; the kale slaw was really lacking in vinaigrette and there was none of the delicious honey aioli I remembered from the previous time I ordered this dish. It didn't get finished.  Bandera-Style Roasted Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#Cc7HeytW61mGJIjsOjzuSQ): 2.5/5 I guess there's only so much you can do with rotisserie chicken, but this wasn't a huge step up from what you can get at El Pollo Loco for far cheaper. While the 1/2 chicken was moister, it was prepared with the same paprika and onion powder rub. The accompanying rice looked fantastic, but was ultimately very bland and herbed with parsley rather than cilantro.  Banana Cream Pie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ) 1/5 The only thing \"banana\"-y about this dessert were the fat slices on the plate. The pie itself had none. The custard wasn't flavored with anything (no vanilla, no banana, no nothing!) but was just your standard thickened egg yolk. And the whipped cream had no sugar or other sweetener mixed into it and was completely bland. This was less than half-eaten between 3 adults.  We were a bit disappointed with our dinner and won't return in future visits to Scottsdale. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who has been to another Hillstone/Houston's in the past."}
{"text":"We were on our way to the Pink Pony only to find it closed down...so sad another tradition gone...thanks economy!    Luckily Bandera is alive and kicking...this place was packed...hostess told us it would be a 30 minute wait for a table (Saturday Night)...we were able to snag a spot at the bar immediately.  We got lucky!  The food was fantastic...like always.  I don't think there is anything bad on this menu.  The Bartender talked us into the trout queso as an app...it was really good. The prime rib was so good (medium rare) and don't forget a side of mac and cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just typing this.   We did not have desert but I've had the key lime pie here in the past and it is fantastic.  It is not always on the menu...so call ahead."}
{"text":"Banderas, you never disappoint! My husband and I love gong there on date nights and special occasions. Extraordinary food selections and drinks! Highly recommend the desserts!"}
{"text":"Honestly surprised they're not top 5 in Scottsdale on Yelp. From ambience to service to food, it's utter perfection. Chef Anthony and Waitress Patricia teamed up for one of my favorite meals in the 'dale. Patricia is all-knowing about the menu, cooking methods, and wines. She even brought us a complimentary banana cream dessert which was light and fluffy, and apparently Food Network's \"best dessert in town.\"  -get The Rule Cabernet -get the dip duo (house made chips) -get the butternut squash enchilada a la carte (it's spicy!) with the peanut coleslaw as a side   Voila! See you again soon Bandera"}
{"text":"It is so good but we had to wait for two hours to get seated.  The cornbread was good and the rest of the dinner was fabulous.  I wish we could eat there more often."}
{"text":"Holy shazam...this place is awesome. I've been to a lot of restaurants, and I'm not that easily impressed - I'm impressed with Bandera.   Everything I ordered was top notch. My entree was the prime rib, which was ridiculous (-ly good). At first I wanted to order the BBQ Salmon, but then I thought, \"Wait, I'm in the middle of the desert, I'm not ordering fish!\" But the waitress suggested the salmon appetizer, so I figured I'd give it a shot - see what a talented chef can do with desert salmon.   Best salmon I've ever had...in the middle of the ******* desert.   That one little anecdote is just a taste of the care and talent Bandera brings to its food. Everything was awesome. Ribs? Sure. Pick it up, take a bite, and oh, all the meat falls off of the bone because it's tender AF. My dining companions had good things to say about the chicken and cornbread, but to be honest I was in too much of a salmon/rib/prime rib haze to comprehend actual words.   Bandera's bar game is pretty on-point, too. They have a good scotch selection, the old fashioned's are a little sweet for my taste - but everyone has their opinion - and my aunt is in love with their lemon drop martinis. I would like to see a bigger wine list, but that's just the wine snob in me. The Syrah I ordered went great with my meal.   In conclusion: quit readin' Yelp. Instead, eat the food, drink the drinks, Bandera = good, I'll fight you if you disagree with me, end of story."}
{"text":"Always great food!   The artichokes are to die for....  how they get 3 halves of heaven out of each grilled choke is beyond me.    The service is FANTASTIC with veteran service staff and talented seating people.   I have yet to have a bad experience.   The tuna is fantastic, trout wonderful, ribs great, chicken perfect.     The banana cream pie (my favorite pie) is prepared in a non traditional way that I wont order again but many love it!     The place is always busy and now you know why!  Thank you Bandera,   I will be back!  Frank T."}
{"text":"Last year, the group I was with and I tried everything on the menu.  Or so it seemed.  Or so I remember.  I don't know; I was drunk.  I do remember, however, that their prime rib was awesome!  I'll try to update this review when I get back this year if I go again."}
{"text":"Our daughter gave us a gift card for Houston's, but found out we could use it at Bandera's. We made reservations for 5:30.  Don't even mess around to find parking. I guess I don't have the 'parking karma' yet. Tried looking for a space for 10 minutes and found valet parking kitty korner to the restaurant. When we got there, the hostess was pleasant and we were immediately seated. Our  server was polite and knowledgeable.  We started off with the Mac & Cheese. WOW, love the larger pasta and with the walnut cornbread crumbles it was delicious. I ordered the Snake River Farms American Style Kobe Tri Tip and Ceasar Salad. I forgot to tell the server that I wanted it medium rare. When I got it, it was not over cooked and the flavors just exploded. The Caesar salad had too much dressing for me. I should have had it on the side. The croutons were made from the cornbread, different, but it worked. My wife had the Kobe-style Steak and Enchilada Platter with Escabeche. She was blown away by the sauce on the enchilada and the flavors of the Escabeche. She ordered a side of Escabeche to go, that's how good it was. By the way, we had an intruder flying around our booth for the first 10 minutes. I hoping it died and didn't pester anyone else. We finished off our meal with Banana Cream Pie with Caramel and Crushed Chocolate. I didn't really need to order it, but I hadn't had one for some time. It was excellent . Now this is a place to bring your friends from out of town that you want to impress."}
{"text":"Found it to be overpriced.  The menu is very limited.  Had their rotisserie chicken and it lacked flavor.  Was disappointing."}
{"text":"Scottsdale has some pretty standard restaurants I could find back in CA: Mastro's, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Wildfish, etc.  Bandera was a safe choice for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had a slightly different menu than the one I go to in Corona del Mar.  We started off with the grilled artichokes with a garlic aoli sauce, deviled eggs, and, of course, the infamous cornbread.  The grilled artichokes were standard fare, simply grilled and seasoned but tasty nonetheless.  The deviled eggs were ok, there were parts of the yolk that hadn't cooked fully through and were slightly congealed.  Also, the filling was a bit too acidic for my tastes.  The cornbread, however, was perfection.  A heaping, crumbly carb filled with corn, queso, and jalepeno.  Yum.  I almost finished the whole pan, that's how yummalicious it was.  If you go here, you must, must, must order the cornbread.    For dinner, I had the grilled loup de mer with a side of tabbouleh and mac n cheese.  The loup de mer was grilled perfectly, was very tasty. The tabbouleh was good, not too lemony and the parsley was in perfect balance.  The mac n cheese is my absolute fave here at Bandera.  The shells are perfectly al dente, the cheese isn't too cheesy, and they top it off with panko bread crumbs.  Ahhh, a dish after my heart.  This is a must have, IMO.  My friend had the ribs and they were super yummy, but I'm not really a ribs kinda gal.  If you dig ribs though, they were falling off the bone, no knife needed.   All in all, it was a pretty good dining experience.  Next time I'm in Scottsdale though, I'll try something a little more adventurous."}
{"text":"Dined here on a busy Spring Training evening with 2 others. Service was courteous and professional.  The menu is much like the Los Altos Grill so I was pleased to see the Cheeseburger. It hit the spot and was cooked perfectly. They know what they are doing.  I thought $13 was a bit high for my vodka and soda since the burger was only a few dollars more. That's the only nit I have."}
{"text":"The aroma of barbecue coming from this place drew us in.  The service however was less than desirable. We started at the front area bar due to a wait for a table.  To be fair the bar and restaurant were busy but the bar tender had enough time to leave the bar a couple of times when we were waiting for drinks. We were sitting in 2 seats so it was hard to overlook the fact that new costumers were seated. We waited for 20-25 minutes without service and were eventually seated for dinner in the restaurant.  The food was very good. We started with corn bread which I highly recommend. My husband got the enchiladas which he really liked and I got a salad with chicken which was good. We got a beer and a margarita. Our server was attentive and had a great personality. However, there was a woman walking around clearing tables that made us feel very rushed through dinner. As soon as we put a fork down our plate was cleared which I usually appreciate. It became a bit aggressive at one point because this happened multiple times immediately upon finishing.  I have been a server in the past so I understand the benefit of quick turnover but my husband and I do not tend to linger in restaurants for long periods of time and the tables around us had all been there longer than we had. When I turned my head my margarita was cleared (which was not cheap) before I was finished. Although the food was very good the service was lacking and I will not plan on returning."}
{"text":"We got engaged tonight and wow what Amazing service! Kasie the manager went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and taken care of!! What an amazing night to remember and what a special place to celebrate!!! All 5's!!!! We will always remember this special night and the amazing staff!"}
{"text":"Gotta love a place that makes meatloaf and potatoes feel like a gourment dinner!  The service is excellent, the place is packed (meaning I must not be the only one who thinks this place rocks!)  We ate at the bar to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on 3/24/16 around 8pm when the Giants/Cubs game was getting out and I had to sit at the bar! The service was great and I had the TriTio and Enchilada with roasted peppers and goat cheese! Yo can never go wrong with Bandera's!"}
{"text":"I went to Bandera with my family who was visiting from Minnesota. It was a good experience before we even entered the restaurant. They had whole chickens cookibg rotisserie style that you could see and smell from outside, creating a wonderful aroma. Our server Megan was very polite and good looking. She was quick with the refills and made sure we had everytjing we needed. We had an appetizer of the corn bread, which was great. The rest of our food was brought out surprisingly quickly. I had the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes. The chicken was maybe the best I have ever had anywhere! So tender and juicy! The mashed potatoes were very good too! My brothers both had the rib and chicken combo and loved it. They preferred the chicken to the ribs, but liked both. I had some over their fries, which were delicious and the corn on the cob looked very good. Everything there was great! Highly recommended for a nice dinner"}
{"text":"I went to Bandera on a girls night, and was excited to try it. That was pretty short lived.   After I looked over the menu I wasn't so keen. Honestly, nothing really sounded that appealing. The food was pricey for what it is, I mean seriously, $7 for an a la carte enchilada and $17 for a chicken salad?   Anyway, I went with the $17 macho salad...it was ok. Not really what I expected based on the description in the menu. My friend and I were hesitant when we saw black squishy bites, but I ventured, and turns out they were dates. Not bad, just unexpected.   Overall my meal was ok, but felt very overpriced for what it was. Would I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Denied service because our party of 7 is too big?! They can't sit parties larger than 4. Happy to take my service else where."}
{"text":"Our experience at Bandera was a good one. It was all four of my parties first time and we were very pleased. The service was decent, our server filled up our drinks quickly and got our food out reasonably quick. It did get awkward at the end though because it seemed like the staff was trying to make us leave quickly by taking away our cups and staring at the check waiting for us to pay it. But besides that the food was very delicious. We got two appraisers (deviled eggs and the Duo dip) and they were both worth getting. All of our meals were also very tasty! We will be returning to Bandera."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews. Did not disappoint. Only bad thing was that we had reservations for 6:45 and was not seated until 7:15.  We had the corn bread, duo dip, grilled salmon & banana cream pie. Everything was delicious and we cleaned our plates.  Have to say this again, our servers were so attentive."}
{"text":"Are you looking for the ultimate cornbread?  Order the cornbread skillet (last time I ate it was $4 for a 5\" or 6\") and you'll search no more!  I began my ventures here on the recommendation of a coworker after I mentioned eating complimentary cornbread from Z'Tejas and the $2 basket at Redfish Grill and Bar.  I first started having one huge slice (you can substitute a slice for a side that comes with their entrees).  I then graduated to just ordering the skillet and having two slices.  On my next visit I had half of the pan (the server even commented how the meal I was having that night wasn't very nutritious).  I seriously believe that my corn allergy was aggravated with my obsession of Bandera's cornbread skillet :(  I was able to try two entrees on separate occasions before I went stir-crazy on the cornbread.  Bandera is known for their rotisserie chicken, so do try some.  The salmon is also very good.  For sides, the spinach and glazed carrots are nice.  The enchilada my aunt tried was also quite tasty!  To help keep your wallet padded, have lunches here instead of dinner.  The vibe here is usually subdued, with great-looking staff and clientele occupying space, but it can get quite noisy on busy nights.  In the summer, try to sit at a booth with the window cracked open.  So refreshing, and quite relaxing- almost like having dinner at one of your chalets."}
{"text":"The outside of this place looks really nice and the inside too. The menu did not have much variety but the quality and quantity of the food was very good. My friend got a cheeseburger and I got the prime steak. The steak was extremely juicy, soft, and omg yummy!!!  The service was really good. Our dirty dishes was taken away really quickly and they checked up on us very often.   We also had a smoked salmon appetizer and that was very good to. They had this tarter sauce that went very well with the salmon. I could eat that sauce by itself lol."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Bandera for many years. That was prior to having children. Well It was my birthday and the girls want to take me there. We get there and my youngest daughter starts going bananas. Crying and screaming, my first thought was we were going to be asked to leave ( as the manager comes over ) what does he do? He offered anything and everything to help us out and help take care of our children. Crackers, bread, he even brought over a plate of frys to help. And boy did it help. The rest of the experience a great as well. Service has always been spectacular.  We have been going for 12 yrs and will continue for another 12. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Since I am a lover of red meat and potatoes, I truly enjoyed my steak, potatoes, and cornbread, with a couple of glasses of Red Wine. :)   Service was just ok. Nothing special which surprised me."}
{"text":"I love the baby back ribs they fall right off the bone! Order them trust me!"}
{"text":"This is a really enjoyable place to have dinner.   We ordered the rotisserie chicken and ribs to share.  The ribs have a delectable mustard sauce on them that we were fighting to have more.  The meal was served with a nice simple cole slaw and tomatoes with goat cheese. We highly recommend the homemade Oreo ice cream sandwich to finish the meal. When we are in town again this is definitely on our places to go back to.  The service was also really spot on, very attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"I come here for the prime rib and the banana cream pie. I saw a chef on the food network talk about this place once (after I visited) and they said to go for the banana cream pie and the prime rib, so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"Great burgers in a casual, yet intimate setting restaurant. We were too full to enjoy dessert, but we were told that their cookie dessert is to die for."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Bandera for dinner & were seated & served quickly by friendly staff. To start with we ordered the cornbread. Smoky, sweet peppers inside gave the bread amazing crumbly texture and flavor, which is a feat to behold as that dish is so easy to make bland & unappetizing. For my entreé I had the Carnitas sandwich which came with fries. The sandwich is absolutely enormous and I could only eat half as it was so messy & filling. Unfortunately, the fries added nothing special to the dish. They were limp & seasoned unevenly. My friends had the Rotisserie Chicken & Meatloaf which they both said were excellent. We all shared the brussel sprouts which were also enormous. The aioli accompanying them was delicious, however I prefer my brussel sprouts to be crispy throughout & bite-sized. Bandera is a solid 4 star restaurant and I'll be back again ordering the cornbread, just not the sandwich or sprouts."}
{"text":"I still want to go back again for the ribeye.  Very impressed with everything.  I don't give a lot of five star but this was very deserving."}
{"text":"Soon to be brother in law brought us to dinner here tonight. We had high expectations for the chicken and corn bread.   The good: Cornbread is the bomb. Sweet, spicy and moist. So good.   Coleslaw is also  winner, spicy but not overpowering. A must try.   The meh: Chicken while tasty didn't knock my socks off. We had just had El Pollo Loco last night and don't see much difference between the two.   Green rice, hmm really lacking flavor. Skip it and sub Coleslaw.   Service was overall very good. Staff was very friendly. We did receive our food rather quickly, which didn't make for a relaxing meal. Timing could have been better.    Overall it is a good place. 5 stars no, but a solid 4. Would try again."}
{"text":"We have been going to Bandera since 2001, and it has always been consistently excellent. I suggest you get an artichoke when they are \"in season,\" and the deviled eggs are phenomenal... You can't go wrong with either!   -Muffy Bennett / Gary Bennett"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner last night at Bandera and it was delicious.  Staff at the bar was warm and welcoming, even offered glasses of water to go with our wine.  Then, when our table was ready, the waitress brought the bar tab along so that we could pay both the food and beverage together.  What a concept, and why don't other places do that?  The matre de who seated us suggested a couple of appetisers - which we did order.  the grilled artichoke was delicious and the ceasar salad was very nicely done.  Although my husband did not like the cornbread croutons that adorned the salad, I loved them.   Our waitress was friendly and professional.  Explaining menu options and giving us time to decide what we wanted to order without hurrying us.  I had the barbequed chicken, which was very moist and delicious.  He had the barbequed beef ribs - another good choice.  I loved the cole slaw with peanuts - it's fantastic.  Prices are quite moderate for what you get.  We spent twice as much at a French restaurant nearby and the food was terrible."}
{"text":"Decor was great very modern and classic but fancy. Their service was great and the food was delicious. They have a small menu that they can perfect each dish which is good. Me and my bf got the rotisserie chicken and beef rib combo with came with 2 sides and was 27$ each. We also got a Caesar salad that was really good as well. By far one of the best Caesars I've had $8 I think it's pricier than other restaurants but it has more to offer and the service and food make up for it . Therefore it's so worth it"}
{"text":"Basically, this is a fancy grill in Old Town Scottsdale.  The food four star but the prices, crowds, and awkward hostess team drops it a star.  I had the chicken and ribs - the ribs were very small, there were only two, but they were very moist and well cooked.  The honey mustard sauce was tasty but a bit overpowering.  The chicken, which is apparently their signature, was pretty run of the mill.  Not sure how they did it but the skin on the chicken wasn't crispy - it was soggy - which is hard to do on a rotisserie.    Now, the awkward hostess and waitin time.  We arrived at 7pm for dinner and was told it would be 75 minutes.  Normally a non-starter but we walked the town and it was fine. A friend of ours decided to join us so we notified the restaurant and they said that adding another person would push the wait to 2.5 hours becuase there are a limited number of tables for 6.  Gulp.  I explained that two in our party are children (aged 2 and 4) and didn't need a full seat.  that seemed to really confuse the hostess ... she reminded me a few times that the wait is 2.5 hours and that we'd still need a party of 6.  Even though they're tiny, would likely be sleeping in the stroller anyway, and the booth style seating meant there'd be plenty of space if we needed it.After speaking to a manager I convinced them to let us take a table for 5 and all was saved.  But let's just say that the hostesses should work on being less awkward and more flexible."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was AMAZING!!! I had the bbq salmon.  The cucumber salad that came with it was incredible.  Great service and our waitress Tammy was awesome.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had Dinner here for spring training - good service, good food. I had the roast chicken, was delicious, and everyone who had ribs was VERY happy"}
{"text":"Okay, this place is great!  The rib-eye was close to Jocko's rib-eye flavor and texture and is one of the better steaks I've had in a long time. Hat's off to you!  The service is top-notch. They use the tag-team approach so each server is hitting your table at different times. GREAT JOB GUYS!  The devil eggs were okay, not home run, but good. The croutons in the will make you think about what they are - very flavorful. I liked them.   The mash potatoes were great too as was the cucumber salad...of course I removed those suckers as I hate them!    The long island ice tea was unique too. Very good stuff.    I don't like chain restaurants, but I like this one!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Bandera is our benchmark; Whenever my husband and I try a new restaurant we always compare it to Bandera. Maybe that's one of the reasons we keep coming back here so often! As many new restaurants as we try, very few measure up to this place. There are so many things I love about Bandera I need to make a list, paragraph form just won't cut it. 1. Consistency. In my experience very few restaurants can pull off making the same dish exactly the same way every single time. Bandera does. We go back over and over again for our favorites and it always tastes exactly the way it's supposed to. 2. Food. It's amazing. Some of our favorites:      -grilled artichokes      - corn bread (my arteries hate me afterwards but seriously, best corn bread ever)      -macho salad      - crispy chicken sandwich      - peanut cole slaw      - every single fresh seasonal vegetable they serve      - banana cream pie 3. Service. Always friendly. Always knowledgable. Love that I can start a tab at the bar while I wait for dinner and they transfer it to the dinner table, no questions asked. And yes, the bartender is tipped out appropriately on this transfer so I don't have to worry about that.  4. Take out. It's hard to find take out that tastes as good at home as it does in the restaurant. Sometimes you just want to eat something delicious in your pajamas and on your couch! And as many times as we have ordered take out from Bandera (and it's been a lot of times) they have never once messed up our order or forgotten anything. Seriously! That never happens but here, it just does.   So, long story longer, we love Bandera. If you've been hopefully you've had the same amazing experiences we have. If you haven't been, GO! And order yourself a home made margarita while waiting for dinner, it's amazing."}
{"text":"So I first went to this place on a business trip with my colleagues. It is a great place. A somewhat classier restaurant though I got in, in warm ups and a t-shirt (after paintballing). At night it's dimly lit and during the day they open up the windows. They have only 2 beers on tap, but both are excellent choices. Stella and Kilt Lifter my favorite beer in the universe brewed right in Tempe! Check my other reviews for more info on that beer. Anyway, they have specials every night so when I took my family the other night I ordered the apricot glazed meatloaf it was phenoninal but I tried everyones plate. So I can personally speak to...the meat loaf, sword fish, Ahi Tuna, chicken enchilada's, and the prime rib sandwhich. All of those were fantastic except the enchiladas I found those to be \"ok\", but not phenominal like the rest of the menu. For appetizers they have a duo dip (guac & cream cheese kind of dip) its very good, I also have had their deviled eggs & corn bread. Also extremely good. Everytime I have been to this place there service has been great, it is a perfect setting for a first date. I believe its a dinner only joint that opens @ 4pm. They take reservations. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So good we came back multiple nights. Service is too notch, they totally took care of it's even though we came in a bit late, and everything we tried over multiple nights was f-ing great. You can't go wrong with this place. I'd give them an extra start for their dress code if I  could."}
{"text":"I travel for work a lot and this place was Hands down amazing. I never think to order corn bread and it rocked my world. My co worker said \"this is a burger you come back for.\" I had the ribs and they were mouth watering. Very nice staff. Booth was comfortable."}
{"text":"This place has always been pricey but I used to think the food, at least, was worth it. I haven't been there in a while and just went last night. although the food was tasty, the portions were like the size of appetizers. I had a tiny little burrito with an ice cream scoop full of salad. My husband had some tasty chicken with an ice cream scoop's worth of  mashed potatoes. My son had a side of fries. We split a beer. With tip we couldn't get out of there for under $62. I think you're just paying for the location of the restaurant; a busy corner in Old Town Scottsdale. It was so dark I couldn't even see the food I was eating. I had to turn my flashlight on to see what was on my plate.  Two stars because the service was pretty good and the food was good but I would not go back there."}
{"text":"The chicken was unreal good!  And, the cornbread, just as reviewers stated was heavenly.  It was light and very good!"}
{"text":"Perfect temperature for the steak, believe me I am from Argentina... If back in Phoenix will come back for sure. Excellent."}
{"text":"Great quality food and the service is great.  I would go back again.  Only reason I gave a four star vs five is the price -- it's pretty expensive for what it is...but still good nevertheless."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Bandera.  We came for dinner before a show at Gammage. We had a 6p reservation but waited a bit before a table cleared. Once we were seated we were attended to promptly. I had a perfectly mixed dry martini and my with a glass of wine. Our dinner was great. I started with a Caesar salad and my with had the small dinner salad - neither were tiny. My BBQ salmon was cooked to perfection and accompanied with mashed potatoes and cucumber salad. All was tasty. My wife enjoyed her French dip and fries. A great meal."}
{"text":"Will absolutely eat here again. Service was prompt, wine/food tasted very fresh and good, and the seats were very comfortable. Bit pricey but so be it"}
{"text":"Fun place. Staff was great. The skillet corn bread and Oreo cookie dessert were defiantly highlights."}
{"text":"You can smell the voluptuous rotisserie chicken wafting down the street, inviting you to experience the classic yet well executed flavors inside Bandera. It would be a shame for you to skip over this place as its in a touristy location. This is outstanding dining and service.  I've spent quite a few years in Chicago and have experienced my fair share of smoked salmon. The smoked salmon app, smoked in house at Bandera was mindblowing. The delicate flavor of the smoke wasn't overpowering and mingled nicely with the fish. There were no bones, and the texture was just flakey and smooth. This was as fresh as it gets and beyond even the finest deli's smoked salmon. Bandera pairs this with a brilliantly executed twist on a caesar dressing. It's a mayo with anchovy paste, lemon juice, black peppers and scallions. I'm trying to recreate this delicious sauce right now. I guarantee I will be back for a lagunitas IPA and this thoughtful appetizer.   For my main, I had the rotisserie chicken. This was seasoned in a light cajun rub and perfectly cooked. I loved how tender everything was. The scallion mashed had an oddly high ratio of scallions, but I enjoyed it. The moisture level was just perfect with this meat.  Another interesting standout was a home made cabbage, this anti-crout had some firmness and was served with goat cheese. Weird but memorable.  Service was spot on, you may have to dress up to get in to this place. Pacing between courses was as it should be and the wait staff was knowledgeable. While bandera is on the pricy side, its not unfair. Your looking at 17$ for the chicken, and 14 for the smoked salmon which fed 2 people. I can't afford to eat here all the time, but my mind keeps wandering to that legendary smoked salmon app. I'll just turn it in to a lunch!"}
{"text":"The chicken Caesar salad was delicious. The rotisserie chicken in it was so moist. I did however have a couple bits of chicken knuckle that should not have been in there. However it was dressed well and the cornbread croutons are delicious.  I love how the kitchen is open so you can see what is going on in the kitchen; it is very clean. The banana cream pie was yum too. The inside is very classy and our waiter was very professional and knowledgable and helped us figure out what to order."}
{"text":"The carnitas pulled pork sandwich was probably the best that I have had, and I have had a great many!! It had avocado, lettuce, and tomato on it. The meat was flavorful and lean. It was not real saucy, but they serve it with this fabulous bbq sauce/glaze!! Yum, yum!   My kids shared the kids chicken dinner. If I could give 10 stars for this, I would. This was by far the best kids meal I have ever had, and we eat out with our kids a LOT! I think it was about $5 and they shared it. It was a leg and a thigh (I assume it is the same as their regular roasted chicken). Super moist and flavorful. Served with a side of your choice. We chose mashed potatoes. They were fantastic too. I also ordered a side of broccoli for them and it was a nice sized portion for $4. The broccoli was super good, but tasted like it had a good amount of butter on it.   Best food we had in Scottsdale for our weekend getaway!"}
{"text":"Somebody please lower the flag to half-mast out of respect for Bandera's dead menu. I was wondering why they kept it dark in the restaurant. It was so dark, I could see the ghosts of past meals wandering around. 'Eeeeat meee.'  I dined there expecting dinner, but felt like I got only small plates. I'll admit less is more sometimes, and with my finickiness and snobbishness for quality over quantity, I'd like to think this was a good deal. Have I been took, because I'm feeling jooked - hook, line, and sinker?  Seasonal Vegetable Platter ($15) was pretty with bright primary and secondary colors of reds, yellow, greens, purple. It served a bit of cucumber salad (very tasty), cherry tomato halves, a slice of red bell pepper and a yellow slice too, broccoli, and disappointing bread that was soggy with something oily.   Skillet Cornbread ($8) is about 6\" diameter. It's good but crumbly and too sweet. I wanted a strong corn flavor with spiciness from the jalapenos, but I tasted no corn and no pepper whatsoever.   Dip Duo ($8) with thick tortilla chips was delicious and I could not stop eating the chips. My impulse was to order more, but the ramification of eating too much of a good thing...ugh, I decided to pass this time around. First dip was avocado. Very good (no tomatoes - yeh!) and not salty. The second dip was of cheese and very salty - chunky too - like cottage cheese which was kinda weird. If you order it, do yourself a flavor and slap some of that salty stuff on the sweet cornbread. Winner!   Salad ($10) was good with fresh greens.  Enchilada ($7) of potato, squash, and shard was topped half-and-half in two sauces tasted okay.  Other items on the menu include entrees and specialties ranging from $15 to $40 and desserts for $8."}
{"text":"I am sad that they took the Mac n Cheese off the menu about a year ago.  If you are going for the 1st time get the cornbread and the chicken and ribs combo.  The peanut slaw is awesome too.  They have a small menu and I have had everything on it and everything is good!  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Some of the trendier places in Old Town Scottsdale seem to draw a progressive crowd. Of course, this being Arizona, that means that only half the crowd is armed. Bandara is such a place.   I was greeted warmly by a bubbly hostess. Seated quickly and greeted again by a server. The menu is concise. In fact, I was surprised how skinny it was but after looking, it was all quality. The wine list was not special but they did have many by the glass selections which was gerat because no one else was interested in wine. Silly people.  I went with the filet. Two petite filets with whipped potatoes. They were perfect and heavenly. The other two at my table had been here before and raved about the desserts. They were pretty good but not jawdropping.  Solid four stars."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Bandera probably 50 times over the last 10 years!  They are, without question, the best run restaurant I have ever been to. The service and the consistency and delivery of the product is second to none. Even when they're slightly off, they are better than the rest. About the food: although the atmosphere is somewhat elegant, the food is purely comfort food. The beef ribs are absolutely delicious! The grilled artichokes, when in season, are amazing! The Caesar salad is the gold standard of all Caesar salads.  The biggest complaint I see on Yelp about them is the price. To that, I say, you get what you pay for!  Note to the manager: please bring back the regular mashed potatoes... cheese potatoes are too cheesy. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"If you want to wait in line for horrible overpriced food and bad service here is the place. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Short and sweet review .  Prime rib and a 9oz filet with a Pittsburg sear.  Both steaks were cooked as orders and to perfection. Cocktails excellent .  Service a 10 Anna was very attentive.  Kelly the GM came to table and was very caring about our selection and service.  A must if you are in Scottsdale ."}
{"text":"The meals at Bandera are always amazing at this place. The grilled articoke appeziters was fantastic, the prime rib is huge and perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the cesear is light and refreshing. The only downside I see is the atmosphere - it's too dark and I always wonder if I'm going to fall asleep before the food comes."}
{"text":"We go here every year after a spring training baseball game. It's always awesome! We love the chicken, mashed potatoes, Cesar salad, and Oreo ice cream dessert. My husband and I are in our 50's and we split everything. We leave full and happy. The employees are always super nice. We love the ambiance, too; the lights are dim and the music is great. I suggest making a reservation. We did ours online a few days in advance. If you don't, there is a long wait. Oh, and we each had a glass of wine which was delicious. :-) One more thing...we noticed a couple walk in and the man had a sleeveless top on. He was politely told he needed something with sleeves. I think he went to his car and got a jacket. So, there is a dress policy, which is fine by me."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker for dinner during a humid nite in Phoenix. Really craved their roto-chicken!  What I liked: -5 stars just for the cornbread!!! Skillet cornbread: try it, you'll love it! -not related to the restaurant, but in a great area, Old Town Scottsdale, nice place to walk around in the evening. -they ban cell phones! Yup, means I can't check my email or fantasy baseball stats, but made for an enjoyable dinner as the ambiance was strictly human conversation. -rotisserie chicken: enjoyed it with the green rice and paired with a great white wine.  Why no fifth star: -good portion for me for the chicken, others might find it small; if so, get the chicken/ribs combo -no sound on the tvs at the bar. -not a large variety of steaks on the menu, more of a nice restaurant than a steakhouse  Overall, really liked the food here; would definitely come back here or visit the one in Sac or Chicago just for the cornbread!"}
{"text":"Was told an hour wait that turned into two hours. Was told that they would comp an appetizer because of the wait. Was charged for appetizer and told that they never told me that. Food was dry and cold. Smells great outside but lacks inside"}
{"text":"Best restaurant EVER! I always have a great dish here to eat. I always leave full and happy. The restaurant is always busy for dinner, but thankfully it doesn't get too loud. I hate when restaurants are too loud. The servers are friendly and the service is quick for a fancy place."}
{"text":"Home of the flying chicken (aka delicious chicken to go that they bring out to your car)!   I have been a Bandera fan for as long as I can remember. Everything on their menu is tasty and high quality. Most frequently my family and I ordered to go; we ordered ribs, chicken, house salad with cornbread croutons, a burger, and fries with spicy mayo (don't forget the spicy mayo). Ordering to pick up could not be easier, you call and order and then they bring your food and bill out to your vehicle. Oh and let me tell you, every single time the order is correct!   Once we got our food home it was still warm and ready to eat. Oh my gosh, the ribs were absolutely incredible! The sauce and the temp that they cook them in are something special. The chicken was juicy and had wonderful flavor, and the burger was cooked perfectly. The house salad is a decent salad on its own, but when you add the dressing and cornbread croutons it is taken to another level; so yummy! The only thing that wasn't up to par were the fries; they were seasoned well, but were not fully cooked which was a disappointment.   If to go isn't your thing you are in luck, the restaurant itself is lovely. It is in the heart of old town and has a traditional and comfortable atmosphere. Just make sure to call for a reservation or get there early, because it is a popular place. The best thing about dining in is the way it smells...heavenly!   Bandera has incredible food, top notch service, and great ambiance. I'll be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"Funny how I have to come all the way to AZ to have salmon done perfect. It was even Seattle BBQ style."}
{"text":"Above average food, below average service.  We ended up at Bandera because there was a wait at the Mission. On arriving we were accosted by a really drunk guy who was completely abusive and spewing nonsense about \"the rich fu%^ers who live in Scottsdale\". Now, Bandera can't control fools on the street but this guy was hanging out with an employee who was working the rotisserie/takeout window. Not a good 1st impression at all.  The person I was with was in a deviled egg mood - not something I'd generally order but the Bandera version was quite tasty. My Macho salad was amazing - goat cheese, almonds,  some sort of dried fruit and fresh chicken. I asked for the dressing on the side and they dutifully omitted it, but never brought the side - however the salad was plenty good without it.  Everything was delivered to the table quickly but we weren't really checked back on (see: no salad dressing above) and they never bothered to refill drinks. That said, for a chain Bandera was above average in the food department."}
{"text":"The BEST artichokes in the world! The macho salad is delicious but....very little  Chicken in it. the bartenders and waitresses act very snooty  The Cornbread is the best in the world."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Hostess quoted a short wait time then gave us the run around for 45 minutes.  Food was overdone and bland.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Overpriced - service was ok. Really disappointed for the price. I'm just not into the hype...."}
{"text":"Really good prime rib. Beware can be a long wait this time of year with spring training in full bloom. We waited over an hour and a half for a table. On street parking can also be an issue. Typical old town Scottsdale overpriced but you are paying to be in old town and the experience.  Food was good, but not sure if it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"The cornbread is fantastic!  It is a MUST HAVE!    Be prepared to wait for a table (during peak dinner hours), but the wait has never been more than 15 minutes.  The BBQ is unique and the portions are large.  The crowds is always eclectic, energetic, and typical for Scottsdale.  Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The ribs were outstanding.  The cole slaw was unique AND good.  I was excited about the chicken, but it didn't deliver.  It was good, but definitely not \"The best rotisserie chicken on the planet\" as many have proclaimed (some might argue that I could get better (i.e., less dry) rotisserie chicken at any number of Costcos or El Pollo Loco's.  I wouldn't go that far, but it's close.)  Next time I'll pass on the deviled eggs and dessert, which were both forgettable.  The environment was perfect.  Lighting, noise level, unpretentious without giving way to the shorts and flip-flops, and the parking, oh the parking."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Caesar salad is amazing.  The chicken is the best I ever had!  Ribs are very tasty.   I was not impressed with the prime rib or burger but maybe it was a bad night for it.   Everything else has been on point and beyond every time"}
{"text":"This place is definitely on my top 5 list for having a delicious meal out. After eating here a few times I didn't think it could get any better but each time we discover better foods on the menu. Anything that they cook on the rotisserie out back tastes awesome and the drink list is nothing to laugh at with only the best bartenders with top shelf liquors! Bandera also can cater your events or call for take out but make sure that you call ahead since everything is prepared fresh and you don't want them to run out ; ) Two of my favorite foods here are the mac and cheese and the chicken and ribs dish which gives you a taste of both worlds! Bandera is a must try for everyone that appreciates food!"}
{"text":"We went there only for their delicious banana cream pie. Great server at the bar!  Go there!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Bandera for years.  I called for reservations as I always do and was told they no longer take reservations.   If you want to have a work dinner , celebrate a birthday or not risk waiting for a table for an hour,  there other excellent dining options with another fine restaurant in Scottsdale.  We always celebrate birthdays here but now go to a competitor on Goldwater Blvd where I quickly secured a reservation.  Normally I would give a 5 star but now they're on the 1 star list."}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment. I love it. Everything is amazing. The service is awesome, Staff has great sense of urgency with every table. I have been here 20 times and every single time has been perfect. Sorry it has taken me so long to review. I cannot get away from the Fillet!!! It is hands down best Ive ever had and most consistent. The corn bread!!!!!!!!!!! OMG, Its awesome!!! When Im there i have to make sure I dont eat too much bread so I save room for my steak!!! Save me a table weekly because I will be here eating my Fillet and cornbread!!!"}
{"text":"After reading favorable reviews, decided to reserve a table so that we could dine after taking a stroll through Old Scottsdale on \"Artwalk Thursday\".  Pleasantly surprised that the restaurant had a dresscode, which is fairly uncommon nowadays.   Only issue was finding parking due to the nearby SF Giants game, but eventually found a spot within a couple of blocks of our destination.  Walking into Bandera immediately reminded us of the old Houston's on Park Avenue South in NYC.   Same subdued lighting and dark wood booths surrounding a vibrant bar scene.   Soon learned that the Hillstone Restaurant Group which runs the Bandera chain also manages Houston's, thus the many similarities.  Menu choices were sufficient to please even picky eaters. Terrific wine and beer and specialty cocktail list.  For a chain restaurant, service, food and value were uniformly excellent across the board. Menu choices were sufficient to please even picky eaters."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Brittany was very attentive. The cornbread was so good. We ordered the rotisserie chicken and rib combo which was delicious."}
{"text":"So we eat at Hillstone or Houstons about 6 to 8 times a month. Tonight was our first time at Bandera.  Made a reservation for 7:00 and we were seated around 7:10 which was excellent!!!  Once seated our impatient waitress was nothing but RUDE at best the entire meal. After asking us if we were ready to order 3 times within 10 minutes....we felt forced to choose our meal and actually would have had an appetizer but weren't given the time to make a decision.  We both had salads with the meal but before we could get finished our meals were already at the table. That is not what we have come to expect with a Hillstone Restaurant.  Our dinners were good Prime Rib and BBQ salmon. No real complaints about food quality with the exception that I had to ask 3 times for my Ice Tea to be refilled...absolutely not acceptable. Again our server was not up to the quality I would expect from a Hillstone restaurant.  Normally I have no problem remembering our waitress name..and providing a substantial TIP but this waitress didn't impress enough to matter.  UPDATE: Received a follow up phone call from General Manager Sarah and was very impressed with her concern about our service last night. I felt reassured that she would address our concerns...thanks to Sarahs follow up we will be visiting Bandera again soon."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance here is always great and consistent. One of the my favorite things about Bandera is just the simplicity of the menu, There is nothing super over complicated. It's simple food that is done really well. If you have an indecisive person in your life this menu will make it a bit easier.   Both of us had prime rib last time we were there and it was great. Cooked correctly, great mashed potatoes on the side. Only real complaint was that the cornbread was just not to my liking how they do it but other than that. Solid place to have a nice dinner."}
{"text":"One of my fav's- They also have stores in Los Altos and Sacto.  I used to be stuck on the Chicken, but now it's the steak and enchiladas- If it's in season, be sure to have some of the cold vegetable salad- \"Escoveche\" or something close to that.  Great martini's and the service- well a buddy of mine lost a couple hundred dollars and got it back the next day.  This place is full of integrity and good food too!!  Try to get one of the open air booth's."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Get the steak...it is awesome!!!! The atmosephere here is very comfortable. One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I dated a much, much older man.  And we always came to Bandera for dinner and would have deep conversations about life.  Well, maybe our conversations weren't thaaat meaningful, but he liked me for my mind- I swear.  Anyhoo, the difference in between then and now is that Bandera is still going strong and is a great contender in the battle of Old Town dining. Prices may have gone up a tad and portions were downsized, but the food is still tasty, the patrons are still trendy and the drinks still flow like the hoover dam.   If you're an older man looking for a spot to bring your much younger date, try this place out.  It impressed me many moons ago, and it would probably do the same for your younger lady.  Other than that, this is a fun spot to have dinner and drinks at before hitting the bar scene."}
{"text":"Their deviled eggs are great and their roasted chicken is juicy and very well seasoned."}
{"text":"This place was great! You must order the cornbread. It is to die for.  One thing, we are from out of town. We called to make reservations and asked about the dress code. The person told us casual. So this being AZ and 112 degrees, we showed up wearing jean, flip-flops, and tee shirts. Boy did we feel out of place. I would say dressy-casual is more the dress code. The food was amazing and the service was perfect. Prices were very reasonable for the quality of both the food and service.  Go here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Having walked all of Scottsdale during our 2.5 hour wait for a table, I understand that this is the upscale restaurant in the area. Not many other choices for a dressy date night, work dinner, or the like. Still, it's not worth the wait, or really any wait. I didn't mind the wait so much, but the hostess was either disingenuous or grossly mistaken about when our table would be ready. Protip for hostesses: don't tell people they are next or point to a specific table as theirs if you intend to seat other people in front of them.   As for the meal, the cornbread was passable. Dry on the outside, a little doughy on the inside, and overwhelmingly jalapeno flavored, though not spicy. The house salad was simple, but good, and I especially liked the deviled egg on the side, which was quite tasty. The service was friendly and efficient, and she kept my water and soda glasses full, so that's a plus. Overall, I can't see any reason why I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Ordered a carry out Roasted Chicken & Mashed Potatoes paid $23.75 and it was the worst chicken i have ever eaten. It had no seasoning and was very bland i will never order from them again. save yourself the money and buy a Rotisserie Chicken from FRY'S market much better flavor and way less expensive."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here.  Used to frequent Bandera in another city I lived in.    Sat at the bar for a while.  Nicely laid out in middle of restaurant.  Had good view of the open kitchen and people watching.  Lighting of the place adds to the cool vibe.  All the waitresses had bright red lipstick on for the Robert Palmer video look.  So glad they brought back the grilled artichoke! Love the remoulade sauce combo. Had the macho salad.  No matter how many times I think I will deviate from ordering that, I can't. That good!  My boyfriend had the filet and said it was one of the best he has had.  Perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth.  The colcannon potatoes and steamed broccoli were a perfect side.  Wait staff very attentive and did not rush us through evening. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"All we wanted was chicken! They were out of chicken. Then we ordered ahi tuna. They were out of that too! We made jokes w the waitress, and she wasn't amused. She tried hard though. Food was not bad, and ambiance was great, but they messed up our waters, didn't have enough food, and made it awkward."}
{"text":"Extremely upsetting dinner. We had a pleasant start, drinks and appetizers were good, but when our meals arrived, our evening took a turn for the worse. Our friend took a bite of his steak and immediately started choking. A cook that was on duty escorted him to the restroom to make sure he was OK. Turns out he wasn't. He and his wife left immediately to the emergency room at Scottsdale Osborne Hospital while my husband, myself, our daughter and our friends' 3 children continued to stay and try and finish our cold dinners (not to worry the kids.) Needless to say, it was a rather unsettling dinner and we were eager to finish up and leave to check up on our friend. We never saw or heard from a manager???????we were stuck with a bill of food that was not eaten and completely un-enjoyable (the server said we took care of your friend's steak, ha!) and on top of it all there was no concern or sympathy towards our friend or our situation at all! Where was a manager during all of this?????? Our meal was fine. The tri-tip was dry and bland. Our experience at Bandera wasn't handled well and because of this we will never go back."}
{"text":"Great dinner...The entrees were both really good...Perfectly cooked...generous portions...Very high quality...but...the cornbread....meh...that everyone raves about...not so much...too sweet and pretty much just made a mess all over our table...also...great service...prompt...courteous...well worth the 77 dollars we spent..."}
{"text":"Bandera looks just like Houston's. I don't know why they have two almost identical restaurants types, but both are just great.   They don't do reservations, so expect a wait. It's a bit more cozier than Houston's with lots of u shape booths and same dimly lit environment.   The artichoke appetizer was not in season and got their cornbread skillet as an app instead. It was real satisfying. Wildfire offers it complimentary though. Don't know if there are Wildfire in AZ.   Their prime rib was so good and same with their filet. Rotisserie chicken was really good from what my friend said.   The service was very warm and friendly.  It's not too loud do you can carry on conversations with your friends.   Overall good place for dining in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale! I would do 5 stars but the wait for  a table can be a long one! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"I love Bandera, it is a great spot to go for dinner, and very \"happening\".  It is a great spot to watch people and go out for a night on the town.  The cornbread is in a class of its own, but everything on the menu is simply amazing.  Excellent service and a very attentive kitchen staff complete the puzzle.  If anything, I would say that Bandera is almost a victim of its own success and is maybe slightly too busy, if anything - but maybe I'm just bitter because I didn't get the chance to linger longer over the amazing meal.  Definitely the best place to grab a bite in old town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Bandera's food, atmosphere and location. I have been dining here for years and always enjoy myself. The employees seem to take great pride in this place, and so should we. Try the steaks, ribs, and the chicken (their pride and joy).  It is somehow affiliated with Houston's (though I haven't figured out how exactly).  The happy hour crowd here can be fun on occasion."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat.  The Cornbread is wonderful, it melts in your mouth.  I have had just about every meal here and my favorite is the filet or the ribs.  Always great!"}
{"text":"One of our great meals. Beautiful restaurant, service and food. Prime rib is fantastic, with a delicious herb crust. All other items great, including deviled eggs and dinner salad with warm chunks of golden beet."}
{"text":"Ok, it's a chain. So what? I try to go here every time I am in town because we don't have a Bandera's at home.  The service is impeccable. The food is delightful.  Since I don't get to venture here often I always choose the Macho salad. It is consistently awesome each time.   On our last visit we sampled the dip duo which consisted of some fresh guacamole and a spicy cheese concoction with some nice, salty corn tortilla chips. Yum!  My dining companion isn't in quite the rut I am in with the Macho salad. This go-round he had the roasted chicken which he devoured. It was juicy, aromatic and flavorful. I know this because some of that chicken was in my salad!  We cannot go wrong with over-stuffing ourselves with the Oreo cookie ice cream desert at the end.  Cheers to you, you lucky ducks who get to dine here whenever you want!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, EVERYTHING we had was delicious and my only compliant is that I don't live closer to a Bandera! All the apps were delicious, cornbread it to die for and the deviled eggs, salad, meatballs were all scrumptious as well! We had the chicken and the macho salad which were also yummy! Margaritas were also great as well! I will be back next time Im in Scottsdale or wherever else I can find one (I've been to the one in Chicago and plan on trying the Corona del Mar one too)"}
{"text":"Great food, prompt service and they pour a real cocktail unlike so many others.  Been here a dozen times and it never gets old.  Superb Martinis, excellent steaks and prime rib and some delectable sides like the grilled artichoke, deviled eggs and skillet cornbread.  Rotisserie Chicken is always a solid choice with a savory rub and it's always tender, juicy and scrumptious."}
{"text":"I went to this place as a last minute decision based on the fact there was no wait.  Not by word of mouth and certainly not by any reviews I have read.  It was simply chance that brought me here.    Upon arrival  I had my wife get us a table so I could go park the car, the server asked her when I would be there and my wife said he is parking the car.  The hostess said I guess I can seat you then.  So after she gets seated the server comes up and ask where I am at.  This was pretty rude.  My wife orders drinks while I am parking the car.  I show up and look over the menu.  They offer a small but to the point menu.  They have mesquite broiled chicken, salads, ribs and other items.  I ordered the Ribs and Chicken plate (26 bucks).  My wife ordered the Macho Salad (17 BUCKS).  The price is not the issue but the food sure was.  My two ribs were burnt to a crisp I mean charcoal and my chicken was cold as ice.  So either our food had been ready and sitting for a while or the server decided to mess with me.  My wife's salad was amazing.  It had goat cheese, chicken and all the fixings.  The drinks were good too.    Overall this place feels like the typical Scottsdale run of the mil attitude infested restaurant that seems to fit the reputation of the area however there are tons of better and friendly restaurants in the area.  My recommendation is to skip this place unless its a last resort."}
{"text":"Very good service. Had the chicken rotisserie and beef ribs. I loved the ribs more than the chicken.  A little pricey but excellent ambience."}
{"text":"A very nice place to eat in Scottsdale.  Wonderful atmosphere and attentive service.  We tried the bangers and mash,  rotisserie chicken and the butternut squash enchiladas.  All were excellent and were complimented by the house margarita.  A place to certainly return to more than once."}
{"text":"A waitress that's wants to get out of her service should never cut off with an excuse w 1 bottle of wine between 2 people...lame excuse. Wouldn't go back! Food great service wrong !!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered two rib eye steaks. One medium, one medium well. They both came out cooked to the same level. We couldn't tell which one is which. I think they were both medium.  Other than that, they were extremely tasty. The mashed potato side was amazing!  They need to included the steak sizes in oz. on the menu and also whether are bone-in or bone-out."}
{"text":"Me and my wife absolutely love this place.  It is our most favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  The atmosphere is very cozy and romantic.  The margaurit as are to die for.  We had the seasonal grilled artichokes and the jalapeño cornbread for appetizers and a round of margauritas to start off.  The artichokes and cornbread are superlicious.  For dinner my wife had the grilled trout and I went for the prime rib.  Everything was perfect and our waitress was very good.  Truly one of the Jems of old town Scottsdale.  We will be back many times again."}
{"text":"on this particular night, we originally had dinner rezzies over at The Estate House just down the street... but i was so strongly turned off by their hostess/wait staff hanging around up front when we walked in the front door there, that i convinced my group to leave.(and i've NEVER done that before in my life, which tells you how unacceptable it was)  since i'm fairly new in town, someone else in our group suggested we go to Bandera instead. everyone else unanimously agreed and then proceeded to rave on about how much i would like it.   we walked in, and were greeted by a professional and warm staff. it was so refreshing, in comparison to the place we had just left. since we didn't have reservations at Bandera, and it was a saturday night, we had a short wait. no problem, cocktails up at the bar anyone?   there seemed to a tiny bit of a scene going on up at the bar... or, uh, rather what scottsdale *attempts* as a scene i guess. haha i mean, who doesn't enjoy looking at pretty people? even if they're trying way too hard to mimic what they think LA people are doing. *sigh* but i digress, back to the cocktails. made just the way i like them. the bartender was also great at handling the large crowd hovering around her while keeping glasses filled until our table was called.  now this is where my love for Bandera started to drop. the menu wasn't exactly exciting.... however, if you're in the mood for a southwest/tex mex style cuisine, this place is definitely for you.(it's just not my thing) everyone at our table insisted i would *love* the cornbread appetizer served in a hot skillet, so we ordered that. it was tasty for sure, but not mind blowing or anything...   for dinner the only thing that even remotely appealed to me on their menu was the filet (when in doubt, go with the steak i always say) which came with a side of grilled mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes. um, the steak was fine, but the veggies and mashers were just ok. not bad, but nothing special.  happily, the service was consistently great throughout the entire night. they kept our drinks filled, and never made us feel rushed or that they were irritated with our requests.  no one ordered dessert, but we all stayed around a little to chat over one last cocktail before finally closing out our tab.  we left in great moods.  would i go out of my way to come back? probably not, but i can see the appeal of this place to others. not all of us love southwest/tex mex food, but for those who do, you'll truly enjoy the experience here."}
{"text":"Great quality food, atmosphere, and location. This is a place to take a date to or just to have an enjoyable evening with great food. The meatloaf (When they have it) is amazing. Steak is also top ofthe line.. Definitely recommend.."}
{"text":"Had an amazing service and dinner there little bit of a mixup with reservations but they sure made up for it would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner tonight at Bandera. We chose it based on Yelp reviews. No reservation. We were seated within 15 minutes. We both had the trip steak and enchilada entree. It was excellent. The enchilada was filled with butternut squash And it was an excellent complement to the tri tip as was the cucumber salad. The service was excellent-efficient and friendly.   Dick Santa Rosa, CA"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Went there this past weekend with my boyfriend and his mother and we all loved our food. Their sides are fantastic. I would definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Used to do the Flying Chicken drive through. Apparently they changed their policy and will not allow French fries to be sold to go. I asked for a manager, and she too refused to sell them. My son is 4, I tell her- and I promise he won't decide to review the fries. She refused. Fries won't get a review but the poor service will. Adios. So many other places to eat."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Was in town for a meeting with executives and one of the people in the group wore a cap with a sports team's logo on it. He was informed he would not be allowed to wear it unless he sat at the bar. After that everything just went down from there. Poor food, poor and rude service, arrogance and way too loud. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all cost. My 5 cents of the day."}
{"text":"A classic steakhouse with an open kitchen.  Thought it was a really up-scale i.e. snooty place but that is not the case at all.  Very casual embience but not like you are eating at McDonald's.  My steak was awesome and the service was great too!  We will be back"}
{"text":"Was a lot better than last time but didn't quite live up to the first time. Great service at the bar tonight and the Prisoner wine selection was excellent. Filet was ordered really rare and turned up slightly more than rare. The cucumber salad was excellent.  I would go back but I'm definitely not dying to return."}
{"text":"I have been yearning to try Bandera for the longest time and decided Saturday afternoon was the perfect treat since I was good all week and it's a date night.  We got there at approx 5pm and they got us in right away no wait.   We were seated near the kitchen which is right in the middle  but I was fine with that since I was entertained with all the culinary artistry that was going on.  I ordered the Barbecue Salmon with Green Rice and Mexican Cucumber Salad and the husband ordered the Roasted Chicken &  Barbecue Beef Rib Combo, instead of coleslaw substituted for the spinach.    I sort consider myself a savvy salmon lover and I give the salmon here an A, it was cooked to perfection.  My husband had no complaints and he enjoyed his choice of food as well.  We did order the cornbeard and we requested it to come out with our meal and I agree with all the previous reviews, the cornbread is yummy."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant. I have been to this one 5-6 times and to the one in Sacramento, CA about the same amount of times. They have Banderas other places and the same restaurant group also owns Houston's and Hillstone.  The atmosphere and lighting is very inviting and cozy.  The food is fantastic (I highly recommend the grilled artichoke as an appetizer) and the service is always incredibly good with very friendly servers (usually very young and cute girls).  This time it was Tanya, who did a great job. Please make sure to try a Lemon Drop.  I had the ribeye steak and it was absolutely fantastic.  On top of all of this, the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant since it opened, at least once a month but usually more often. Tonight the General Manager Sarah Ansley has turned us off to Bandera so that we will never be returning. We came to celebrate a birthday and were gladly willing to wait 45 minutes for a table. As we were taking pictures the host walked up to us and informed us that our 16 year old son was out of dress code in a jersey (mind you during March madness) and if we wanted to stay we would need to go get him a different shirt. We then asked how much longer our wait was going to be to which the general manager responded \"about 44 minutes.\" Even after over 15 minutes already waiting. My boyfriend then responded \"I'll go buy him a fucking poncho then.\" And walked out to buy him one. After mumbling under her breathe \"he won't be eating in MY RESTAURANT\" she then walked up to me, who had just received my drink at the bar and took it from me and told me because he cursed we couldn't eat there. Not only embarrassing but completely irrational. So bad that the nice older couple who witnessed it all decided they would voluntarily be leaving the place as well... NEVER again will we be back, horrible management and  a total birthday ruiner."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants! The service is outstanding. Quick, friendly, and give you constant attention! Appetizer: you have to get the Dip Duo and the Cornbread! Meal: The Ribs are devine. I crave them all the time! The sauce on top is the perfect addition. If you are visiting out of town be sure to make the stop!"}
{"text":"I am a \"regular\" whatever that means.  In sitting here by myself, I was able to look around and I am genuinely impressed with the attention to detail the staff exhibits.  The kitchen staff moves like a well oiled machine.  Each person doing exactly what they need to for the best experience.  Cortney was the bar tender and eating at the bar is great if you are alone because you aren't really alone.  The drinks were very good, food was ordered exactly as expected and delivered exactly as needed.  I continue to come here and I am continually impressed. After 7 years you'd think Cortney would be burned out but she is as eager as day one.  That speaks to the quality of the establishment to retain an employee for 7 years.  Good job."}
{"text":"Houston's, but with a less extensive menu...that's what people say about this place.  And they are right...to an extent...so that probably explains why I actually like the place:)  The Beautiful Carin and I wandered over for dinner the other evening (as you can see, I am a little bit behind on writing my little review-like stories:)  We have been a number of times over the years because when you live in Old Town Scottsdale, Bandera is:  * Close * Pretty Decent Food * Close * Pretty Good Martinis * Close  We generally go to Bandera in the summer and fall when the crowds are gone and they seem almost pathetically happy to see us walk through the door:)  I do enjoy the corn bread...like corny, bready candy:)  And the martini's are big and chock full of vitamin V (and priced somewhat less than the marti's at AZ88:)  The food has always been good, the short ribs, the rotisserie chicken, the prime rib...you know, just good, solid, all-american fare:)  Bandera is probably nothing you'd go out of your way for, and certainly nothing that I would queue up for a 90 minute wait for (during the winter months), but worth the stroll over this time of year:)  So, if you're in Old Town and looking for corn bread, braised short ribs and an ice cold vodka marti, stop in and see the folks at Houstera...I mean Bandston's...oh, you know what I mean:"}
{"text":"Awesome waitress, appalling general manager and hostess, sat our party at 2 different tables, when we called for reservations the manager told us he would accommodate 6 even though their policy was 5 in a booth. They then put  an automatic 18% tip for a party of six. No apology, nothing. So done with this place."}
{"text":"This is the best food I have had since we arrived. Every place has been really good but this Macho Salad is for real and the cornbread is to die for! Cannot recommend enough. The chicken is rotisseries in the back over wood and is amazing. Love"}
{"text":"We love this place. One of our go to places. I love the location. I normally order their chicken salad and my husband normally orders the ribs. Great go to spot."}
{"text":"Food was good as usual however mid meal (we shared the rib/chicken combo) our waitress asked if we were going to have dessert. Because we were not she brought our bill right away. As we were still eating she asked if we were done so she could take our plates. When we were finished eating she took the plates and also grabbed our drink glasses. She really wanted us out of there.  So not the normal - must be an off night."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently went to Bandera for the very first time, and I have to say we've never been treated so awful from a restaurant. We were greeted in the back lot by a woman who yelled to us if we were eating at the restaurant. I believe she yelled across the lot because she wanted to make sure we weren't just parking there. She then welcomed us and told us to go to the front to be seated. Waitress was pleasant, told us the specials, and we ordered. Here's where it goes down hill...Our bill came, my husband put his discover card in the tray, and it was picked up. Moments later a lady comes to our table sets the tray down and says they don't take discover, and walks away. Discover was our only form of pymt, so we flagged down our waitress. We told her we were just told the restaurant doesn't accept discover.  She confirmed and said we need to use another form of pymt. We explained Discover is our only form of pymt, we do not have another card or cash. People are now looking over at our table wondering what's going on....waitress said she'll get her mgr. Mgr comes to the table, repeats they don't take discover.  She asked for another form of pymt(don't you think we would of done this if we had it). My husband asked why there wasn't a post displaying the types of pymts accepted when entering the restaurant, and we didn't see anything on the menu. Mgr said she doesn't know why they don't list pymt info on the door or menu,  but did tell us that she gets a Discover card about once a month and people in Scottsdale usually have other forms of pymt or cash. Seriously, what was she implying. Mgr told us we could leave to get money and come back to pay(Don't you think we would of done that if that was an option). She then asked when could we pay, asked us our names,  if we had a business card to give her, etc. We felt like we were now getting interrogated (I get it, they want to get paid but now everyone around us watching and listening, it was embarrassing). We told her our names, we don't have business cards, and we would come back next weekend. She said ok, gave us our bill and her business card. Really, at this point what do you do?? My husband and I left. While in our car I remembered that I had my husband's $100 gift card he got back in December(we forgot about it since it had been a while), so we drove back to the restaurant. We knew it would pay the entire bill, but sadly the waitress wouldn't get a decent tip. I went back in the restaurant, found the mgr and told her I remembered we had a gift card and it should have $100 on it since we never used it. She processed the card, hands me another receipt and tells me we still owe $9.51 and to return to pay it(are you kidding me). I got back to my car and told my husband there wasn't $100 on the card and the mgr said we still owe $9.51 and we need to come back to pay. My husband said are you kidding me...lol. We never used the gift card, so i decided to call the 800 number. There was a pending charge from Bandera's for $100, so i called Bandera and told the mgr the bill should be paid plus a little for tip. Mgr told me they add 20% for tip and most gift cards will only process up to 80% of the card amount and I'll get refunded the difference when they batch out. Mgr should of told me full pymt may not go through, and we may still owe money depending on amount on card.  But NO she didn't, just tells me we still owe $9.51. Are you kidding Bandera!! It was not our fault your restaurant does not take Discover. Maybe your restaurant needs to display pymt methods on the door where customers enter. We have NEVER had an issue with using our Discover card!!! We made an effort to pay our bill, your restaurant inconvenienced us and were not apologetic either! The money was on the gift card, so it's not our problem your Mgr couldn't just run the card for the exact amount of $100. We had nothing less then an unpleasant experience and you made us feel like this was our fault. Really, we still owe $9.51. Send your Mgr to us to collect the $9.51 that your restaurant so dearly needs.  We have going to restaurants for over 20 years and have never been treated so poorly. Shame on you for the way you treat customers. This all could have been avoided if pymt methods were posted!! By the way I called your corporate office and I was told i should of asked what types of pymts are accepted before we ate at your restaurant, and that the owner thinks it tacky to display pymt methods on the doors of his establishments. The service just keeps getting better! Really, what's tacky is asking a customer to go through hoops to pay the bill due to the ignorance of the establishment not displaying pymt methods then assume customer should know. Then have the audacity to tell the customer they still owe $9.51 after all that happened. LOL, you've got to be kidding me!"}
{"text":"My go to place in Scottsdale.  Good menu.  Great Bartenders.  Relaxing and classy. You cannot go wrong. Not cheap but not uberly  expensive."}
{"text":"Great place. Everything we ordered was great. We just chose the place at random. Good service."}
{"text":"It's all about the artichoke here!!! Ok maybe the cornbread! No no it's the deviled eggs!! I can't wait for my next visit here because everything was so delicious! My mouth is already watering! I couldn't really eat my entree because I filled up on all of the appetizers. My friends seemed to really enjoy their drinks. I'm pregnant so I couldn't join in on their merriment, but the Jackrabbit smelled heavenly! I'll have to come back in 5 months to try it!!"}
{"text":"We were at this location on Sunday to celebrate my sister's birthday.  The food was fantastic and the service was beyond my expectation.  The servers were attentive and one young man ( can't remember his name- wore glasses, dark brown wavy hair; sorry ) assisted my husband who has a physical disability by having us sit at a table closer to where we entered that had easier access.  We entered from the parking lot and walked through the kitchen prep area.  I was very grateful for this kind young man!  We love this place!"}
{"text":"This Bandera has been one of my favorite spots for 20 years. They only have a few locations in the states, and whenever I know that I will be in a city where there is a Bandera, then I plan on eating there. It's usually a one page menu, comfy upscale place that is been serving great food for over 20 years. Everyone who I've ever taken there has always loved it!  From the amazing cornbread, to the salmon and Dip duo to my all-time favorite salad, the macho salad... The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The chicken was great. I wish I would have checked Yelp though as it was definitely not a kid friendly place. The service was rather slow which for a \"date\" restaurant that was probably fine but we took two toddlers there just based on a recommendation that the food was good but we didn't talk about the atmosphere."}
{"text":"A nice, quiet atmosphere on the main drag with excellent service. The food was fantastic with an OK price."}
{"text":"I dined here for the first time on Friday and was blown away. The customer service here was top of the line. We made reservations and checked in upon arrival and were seated right away even in a busy Friday night at 7:30. Everyone was friendly and polite! I started with their house margarita which was made especially well. We tried the special for our appetizer which was roasted Brussels sprouts with a dipping sauce and it was amazing and very healthy. For my entree I had the enchilada. The enchilada was different with the squash inside but the sauces they topped it with added a lot of flavor. It came with their cucumber salad and cilantro lime rice both were great compliments of the main dish. Will defiantly be back for special occasions since it is a little pricey!"}
{"text":"Ordinarily, I hate chain restaurants.  But, this one wins me over.  Is it the fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice for their greyhounds?  The cornbread served in a mini-skillet?  The fabulous cheese dip appetizer?  That damn fine chicken?  I dunno.  Just know I like it!!!"}
{"text":"8 things i love about you bandera:  1. your welcoming atmosphere - thank you for opening your kitchen doors to us - literally! walking through it made me feel like you had nothing to hide and everything to share!  2. your super friendly service - clean-cut uniforms with little sheriff like badges with your names on them, super smiley and attentive service, and just enough attention to keep our conversation flowing and our food & drink coming.  3. your easy parking - lots of street parking and a quiet lot with special places to put my car.   4. the way you fit right in - with matching yet modern decor to the old town scottsdale outside, you set the mood. i feel like biting straight into your famous flying chicken and ordering me an old-fashioned gimlet!   5. your love letter of a menu - with wooing words of homey sides and starters, and a well varied assortment of meat, fish, vegetables, and desserts, i was spoiled even before beginning my meal.   6. your cornbread - could i ask for anything warmer, sweeter, or comfier? with bites of jalapeno and delicious crunchy parts, you had me at corn--.  7. your banana cream pie - with real chunks of fruit (yes!), and a wonderful praline-like crust, you were lighter and healthier than i expected. all the more reason for me to want you more.  8. the way you make me wanting more - i need to see you again. i long to see you again. for those beef ribs. for that prime rib. for that barbequed salmon. and to revisit that grilled halibut and mexican cucumber salad. mMmmM."}
{"text":"The Tri-Tip was the best I've ever had, but the tuna was not good.  Good, fast service."}
{"text":"Delicious! Service was great as well. Had the rotisserie chicken with ribs.  Both meats were super tasty and tinder.  I actually don't care for coleslaw or tomatoes both of which are sides  for this dish. I thoroughly enjoyed both however.   Had the oreo sanwhich dessert.  I thought it was well made. I unfortunately have an intense dislike of coffee and the sauce includes that flavor.  But I would highly recommend this dessert for those oreo and coffee lovers."}
{"text":"There isn't anything I don't like about Bandera! The artichokes are fabulous. The Dip Duo Queso is like heaven in your mouth. Prime Rib is exquisite. I have never had a bad meal here and I've been coming for the last 15 years. From start to finish Bandera is a fantastic place to eat.   Get the Banana Cream pie for desert. So yummy."}
{"text":"I arrived with a friend at 7pm to a 45 minute wait list so we walked over to saltys and came back & we're seated promptly. The place was packed for a Monday night and buzzing with loud noise. It was a bit hard to even have a dinner conversation but we got through it. I loved the atmosphere for the most part and the lighting.  We ordered the famous and well deserved reason to be famous artichokes- yum! Got a beer and a vodka ginger ale promptly and then ordered: I had the kale salad with peanut dressing and chicken and he had the enchilada plate - I loved my salad and he very much liked his no-meat enchilada that seemed to have sweet potato in it I believe? It was an interesting plate with a side salad he enjoyed and slices of pork. I didn't give it 5 stars because the pork was dry but I will say the side of horseradish we asked for to help pair with the dryness did help.  I would be back but not on a busy crazy night like this... would be much more enjoyable to be here on a slower night where you can visit and sip."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Bandera fan (they have locations in Sacramento and Chicago, among others), and as far as quality and service, the Scottsdale branch of this classy establishment did not disappoint. I LOVE the seasonal veggie platter, which features a veritable bounty of the freshest veggies, cooked to perfection. Try the tuna poke, and pretty much every dessert on the menu if you're feeling decadent (but mostly the banana creme pie, a dish which I used to order and take home to eat in bed... don't judge me). So, my enthusiasm for Bandera is pretty solid. The reason why the fifth star eludes this restaurant is because they have the hardest time managing to seat people on time. I don't mind waiting (they have a bar, so no problems here), it's just something that's worth addressing."}
{"text":"This review might be a little biased.. I only had their fried artichoke, INCREDIBLE CORNBREAD (melt in your mouth jalepeno zest) and their Oreo dessert. But regardless, this place is a \"must go to\".   Great atmosphere, we stayed there for over an hour and a half talking with just simple small dishes. Very relaxed, yet personal vibes going on and our waiter was HILARIOUS. great service, great recommendations and even tastier food!   If you're in downtown Scottsdale and looking for a place to dine.. I would definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I must begin this review by saying do NOT miss ordering their coffee and desserts at the end of your meal. They only have 2 desserts if I remember correctly? A banana dessert and a chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream one. Both are \"adult\" desserts, not too sweet, decadent, and their coffee is so delicious! I managed a Starbucks for a year and the coffee used at Banderas is far better. They are so great- they bring chilled cream to your table for the coffee!! Real cream, not junky crap. Its just delicious. Dont miss the roasted artichoke appetizer! I had the salmon dinner and it was cooked properly and was nicely seasoned. The dinner items didnt blow me away, but they were good.  Definitely recommend as a cool place to go without small children. Dim lighting, comfortable tables/booths, and friendly staff. I enjoy going to Bandera just for the coffee and dessert! :-)"}
{"text":"Bandera is one of my favorite places to bring visiting out-of-town guests because the service is consistently \"best in class\". The Bandera Baby Back Short rack of ribs is the best I've had from anywhere in AZ. On this evening, my guest Sheldon had sliced sirloin and enchiladas which were excellent, both in presentation and flavor.  There are lots of restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale, and many of them are very, very good... But, I keep going back to Bandera because of their incredibly consistent high quality service and a menu that may be less variety than most people are used to seeing, but which every single entree is excellent.  Plus, I seem to run into a lot of the PHX Valley's movers and shakers in this establishment while dining there or hanging out at the excellent bar that seems to be quite the hot spot."}
{"text":"Don't eat at Banderas in old town. Their servers are great but their \"reservation\" policies are wack!! If you have a large group, EVERYONE has to be there before they will seat you. So if someone is late and another group come in before your last person shows up, you'll lose your table. Corporations suck! Eat at locally owned establishments.  The food is average. I've had better."}
{"text":"Always a good choice!  We didn't have a reservation but were able to be seated right away.  They had the grilled artichokes which are our favorites.  They are grilled perfectly and are so \"meaty\".  I was going to order the rotisserie chicken which is always moist and tasty but, the trout was the special and we both ended up ordering it.  Everything was perfection.  The servers are attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"New Years 2016!  I really enjoyed the salad and the Fillet was amazing.  The mashed potatoes had too much onions, but still eatable.  I loved the meal!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale. The rotisserie chicken is wonderful, but what brings me back every time is their AMAZING Macho Salad. I dream about this salad, find myself craving this salad several times a week...and not living in Scottsdale this sucks (although just found out they are a chain and I can now go to the one in Orange County, CA. Yay).  I also recommend the skillet cornbread, it's VERY good! The wine & beer lists are really good too. Only thing on the menu that ever disappointed was the mashed potatoes, who the hell puts cauliflower in mashed potatoes?! LOL"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Food and drinks did not disappoint, service was attentive. Our group shared the corn bread and dip duo, highly recommend both. I had the chicken and ribs....can't complain, moist chicken and fall off the rib bone, slaw was delicious. I had chance to taste my colleague butternut enchiladas which was also delicious, the mole sauce is perfect!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here to kill some time prior to a dinner reservation at another restaurant. The staff were so friendly that we decided to change our reservation and eat here. The food was excellent, reasonably priced and the atmosphere very comfortable. We had a first-time experience with our lovely server,Amy, who after we were about halfway finished with our martini brought a fresh chilled glass for the remainder. A class act. Her service was exceptional and we cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"I think I may have broken a tooth on a rock in my mashed potatoes.  Service was great but......,"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal!  We got there early and watched as the restaurant filled.  Our service was stellar.  You feel as though all servers work as a team and are able to anticipate your every need.  The speed in which they get drinks, appetizers and the delicious entrees out was excellent.  We had the prime rib, wild mushroom meatloaf and the rotisserie chicken.  Couldn't decide which was best because they were all do good.  Definitely don't miss treat.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Off My List For Good  This is a place I either used to go to, or order take-out from several times a month for years. I loved that if I didn't feel like getting dressed to go out, I could drive up and they would bring my food right to my car - so yes, convenience was a factor.  It is still convenient, but for the value, the prices have gotten awfully high over the years.   Many of the items that I came to love on the menu have been modified to the point of not hitting the mark with me anymore, or have been removed. When I ask about the modified items, I am told that they have not been changed, but I've been dining there longer than most of their staff has been working there. I have tried newly added items over time, but I just don't care for them, not limited to, but especially the fried items. They are all way too heavy.  Maybe I'm a throw back, but I would like to have the same Macho Salad, with the same dressing that I enjoyed in 2001. I would like to see house smoked salmon on the menu all of the time. It is on the menu of all of the other 4 Banderas across the country, why not here? I really miss the grilled lamb sirloin.  To give them credit, the rotisserie chicken is wonderful. At least they haven't changed that, and at least they have stopped serving it in that awful puddle of tortilla sauce which you had to remember ask them to leave off the plate once they started serving it that way.  Between their prices, unpleasantly shifting menu, and the absence of my favorites, I give up. Although service is ok, I want to go somewhere where they have food I can enjoy."}
{"text":"Warning: It's dark here. You may have to squint to see your food, or your date for that matter. The wait staff is friendly, although not very educated on wine pairings. Good thing I had my date to assist me. The chicken is super yummy, although quite large for one person. The sides are good, too. We had plenty left over and took it to go. I can attest that the food is just as good warmed up the day after.   This is a good date spot, although I wish it weren't in Old Town in the tourist trap. It takes away from the appeal of going. But, don't let the location prevent you from trying it once. It's worth it."}
{"text":"I do love this restaurant, the food is amazing.  I went there this weekend with my parents who were in town.  I felt like the servers were kind of stuck up and didn't feel they treated us very well.  Also my mom and I were pretty sick from our dinners.  I do really love this place but may think twice before eating there again."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday, right before close, on a Friday night. Didn't realize that and were going to leave so as not to inconvenience them but they insisted on seating us.  Jillian was great! Took great care of us, completely pleasant, and the food was unbelievable. Fantastic steaks, had a great wine pairing, and they brought us more blue cheese olives upon request, twice!!!  Totally coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, drinks are pricey but it's over shadowed by the food quality."}
{"text":"After reading some glowing reviews of Bandera (specifically of their 'best on the planet' cornbread) here on Yelp, Krashawnda just had to try the place. We went on a Friday night and were quoted a wait time of about 45 minutes, though they actually were able to get us in a bit quicker. The hostess was extremely helpful and polite and accommodated us really well; even though we missed our name being called while we were out walking... upon returning she was overly apologetic and concerned with getting us the next available table even though it wasn't her fault... kudos for that.   The ambience in the place is superb. As some others have mentioned it is a little dark, but we enjoyed that and found it to be rather relaxing and romantic. If you happen to be on a date this would be a great place to snuggle up in a booth together to enjoy the night. The darker lighting and decor creates a classy feel without feeling too pretentious like some other Scottsdale locales... although like any nice Scottsdale restaurant it's going to be hard to completely avoid the 'tool factor'... you're still likely to see a few spray tanned  Scottsdalians with their collars popped getting fueled for a night of mindless club hopping.   Now for the best thing about this place... the food! The menu is pretty basic, no Cheesecake Factory bible-sized menus; just one page chock full 'o yummy easily recognizable dishes. We started out with a couple of appetizers; the deviled eggs and the much talked about cornbread. First off the deviled eggs were very tasty... I'm not sure what they used in them, but they had this slightly chunky consistency and the taste was different than the usual homemade deviled eggs I'm used to... kind of like deviled eggs on steroids; very good and cheap (About three bucks for four of them, perfect just to try). Next on the docket was the much ballyhooed cornbread. I've never been a huge fan of cornbread... but I have to admit; the other Yelpers are right on the money here; it's the best cornbread I've ever had. Each bite was like little fireworks of buttery crunchy goodness going off in my mouth. They cook the cornbread in this perfect way so that it's crunchy on the outside yet soft and moist on the inside. It really is heavenly... and this is coming from someone who usually passes on cornbread. For our main dish we split the rotisserie chicken sandwich and a half rack of pork ribs. Both were amazing... the ribs fell right of the bone and were served on a bed of super thin crunchy French fries. The chicken in the sandwich was cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. The sandwich also came with a small salad which was sprinkled with some kind of nuts and tasted very fresh. The portions were perfect... not too much but certainly enough to fill you up. We saved just enough room to try their 'Homemade Oreo Cookie Sandwiches'... and I'm really glad we did, I squealed with delight each bite I took... it was amazing. They were basically two medium sized crispy chocolate cookies stuffed with homemade Oreo ice cream... served on a bed of hot fudge. It was everything I imagined it would be and more; definitely one of those deserts that doesn't disappoint you when they bring it out. It's one of the best desserts I've had in a while.   To add to everything, the service was also very prompt and courteous. We didn't have to wait long for our food (which is always nice) and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We definitely got the feeling that they train their wait staff very well, the only close to negative thing I could say is that sometimes they might come off a little fake and disingenuous with how they always have a huge smile on their face; there's that feeling that they might be being nice to your face, then complaining about you when they're not by your table... but that's really nitpicking, in fact I don't know why I even mentioned it. One nice quirk was when they brought us our bill the 'customer copy' of the receipt was neatly folded over the credit card like a little piece of origami... cool little things like that make a big difference when looking back at your dining experience.   From start to finish I'd have to say the place really blew us away... it's definitely the total package and it's somewhere I look forward to eating at again. I can't imagine anyone going here and giving the place anything less than four stars. As it stands right now it's a solid 5/5 from us. If you're in the mood for some solid grub in the medium price range this place is a sure shot"}
{"text":"Love Banderas! I eat here every time I come to town, one of my favorites! Great place to bring clients and friends the love the atmosphere, the staff is fantastic and the food is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"A must visit anytime your anywhere near Scottsdale! The wait can be long, but, find a place at the bar and enjoy the wait!!  You can't miss If you try the roasted chicken and rib combo. Also gotta get an artichoke....its fire roasted!!U"}
{"text":"Me and a friend came here after dinner at the Pink Pony to have a drink and people watch. Great service and a pretty center bar to relax. I'd like to come back for dinner here.*"}
{"text":"Deliciousness! I came here two nights in a row during my trip to Scottsdale. The house wine is really good, the service was amazing and the ambience is . I had the grilled artichoke which was so yummy. They give you three big halves that have been grilled with seasonings, and a mustard lemon dipping sauce. I also had the Caesar salad (delicious) and the rotisserie chicken. Then chicken is served with mashed potatoes and over this amazing natural sauce, probably the drippings. It is SO good yet still feels light."}
{"text":"This place was not what I was expecting. Based on the pictures and other reviews, I was anticipating \"cowboy\" style but in reality the leather booths, sleek bar area and cool, modern open kitchen were anything but rustic. Although not as classy as Cowboy Chao, this place is definitely way more upscale than the nearby Pink Pony or Saddle Ranch. I got sort of a mellow supper-club vibe from the classic cocktails on the menu and the jazz music playing in the background. There were very few people in the dining area when we ate there on Sunday evening since it was early (we arrived shortly after they opened at 4:30) but I can see how this place probably gets much more upbeat on Friday and Saturday nights.   The menu at Bandera is not really my style of food but my hubby really liked the roasted chicken and beef rib combo that he ordered. Of course, like everyone else we had to start with the cornbread and it really lived up to the hype. It was truly amazing. I ordered the Macho salad which was ok; I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it did not have WAY TOO MUCH dressing. All the flavors were good but that kind of ruined it for me. Fortunately I had ordered the artichoke appetizer as a side dish and so I was happy to munch on that instead. We were too stuffed for dessert but I did spy a couple on the menu that sounded great. I think I would love to come here another night for drinks and dessert but there are so many other good restaurants in the area that I haven't tried yet I doubt we will be back to Bandera for dinner. I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars since it did exceed my expectations and it is a better than average restaurant but I just didn't like it as much as my 4 star places."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there on Monday night, had an amazing meal.  It was one of the best filet mignon either of us have ever tasted.  The artichoke appetizer was fantastic, best choke I've ever had.  Waitress was very good as well.    It was so good that the very next night (last night - Tuesday) we decided to go back.    We arrived at 915-930pm.  We were promptly seated. And we knew very quickly what we wanted to eat.  Prime rib and ahi, Caesar salads, and an artichoke app.  Ordered it.  Got a couple beers.   Then very quickly we got our artichoke.  Next we got our salads about two minutes later, and about two minutes after that we got our entrees.  We'd literally taken maybe two bites of salad and the waitress brings the entrees.    Talk about rushed!  It only gets worse.  About four minutes later the waitress comes by and takes my friend's beer glass.  He said \" can I have another one?\"  She said, \"we're not serving anymore alcohol.\"  And I forgot to mention that the waitress had a generally bad attitude and snooty demeanor.  She was very obviously annoyed by a late table.  Very obviously annoyed.  No apology about the rush or no more beer just a snotty attitude.  She didn't even ask if we wanted dessert.  She was just thrilled to see us leave.    Call me crazy but in my 25 years working and managing a multitude of restaurants in every food genre and class NEVER, unless it was 2am and illegal did anyone not get offered another drink.  NEVER did I treat a customer so poorly, and NEVER did I allow my staff to do so either.    Maybe we need to put training wheels on the conversation for their staff.  Anyone heard of profit and loss?  EPIC FAILURE!    You lost customers.  You lost profit.  I vote with my wallet.  And my friend that took me out both nights makes more sitting on his couch than the staff put together.  It would be laughable to be treated like crap by crappy staff if it wasn't such a phenomenal example of how NOT to do customer service.    You lost big money; big Scottsdale money.    Call me crazy"}
{"text":"So it's been almost 3 years since a friend of mine told me this place was not so great so I never went. Finally after all this time we decided to give it a shot. What a shame we waited so long! The restaurant is truly a great spot. It's a limited menu so don't expect to have a million things to choose from, but it's got the basics and good ones at that.  I tried their chicken and rib dish and was very happy with the result. Juicy, flavorful, and gone in about 15 min. The meat slipped right off the bone and had the perfect touch of sweetness. My gf had the chicken sandwhich (we've ordered it to go 2 times since) and it's def a winner. Big and enough for two to share if you're concerned about your beach body. Sides are okay, thought the fries were more like shoestring and even still, really too thin and crispy to call it a fry. Mashed potatoes are decent not a big fan of the amount of scallions mixed in...call me crazy but I'm not feelin' a crunch when I eat mashed potatoes! Mac and cheese was pretty good, thought it was cooked really well not extremely cheesy (although I do like that too) but enough to make you feel good and prob my favorite of all three.  My only problem was this: we ordered the cornbread bc it's obviously their highlight app (and it was reaaaaallllyyy good) but we didn't get it until after they served our main course. Kinda annoying but not the end of the world.  Insdide is very reminiscent of a Houston's style retaurant in terms of lighting and booths and colors. Nothing super cool but still very nice. Always draws a crowd but a drink at the bar never hurt anyone. House margarita was real tasty, but hit me with a little more tequila next time so I can feel it!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my wedding anniversary. Made a reservation and asked for a romantic booth and they provided, which was nice.   Waitress was ok. She was professional and attentive but not the most warm or friendly. She was kind of just straight to the point like let's get your order, get your food, bill and get you out. Not much chatting or enthusiasm in regards to the menu.   I had heard amazing things about Bandera and we were so excited to try it because we LOVE Houston's -- unfortunately it wasn't as awesome and we thought it'd be.   Ambience and environment are nice. Good was ok but just not amazing - especially for the price. I was surprised how limited their menu was and just expected more options. I had to try the cornbread bc of the reviews but to me, it was a little dry and was good but not great. Guess I'm used to more buttery, southern home cooking type of cornbread. The steak was ok but Houston's is sooo much better bc of the marinade. My husband made the comment that the sauce on the ribs tasted like chick-fila sauce and it so did!!   Overall just wasn't too impressed, especially for the price. Glad we tried it but we'll stick to Houston's!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Scottsdale, I have to come here for dinner.  Since it is only about once a year, I HAVE to have the BBQ Salmon!  It is consistantly awesome, I promise.  We start with the queso dip and the iron skillet corn bread but honestly that salmon is a star and believe me I usually choose steak over fish.  This is a winner.  Where I live we have Houstons and I have pleaded with them to have the corn bread, cheese dip and BBQ salmon put on the menu.  They have declined...pity."}
{"text":"This as with all the other Hillstone group restaurants are always good. Came here for Valentines Day everything was great. Usually the service at places lack when there is a special occasion, but definitely not here. You will be happy with everything you order. I would recommend the burger tho. Wow thats all i have to say."}
{"text":"Bandera is never disappointing. I like to make reservations online because it's usually packed. Even on the weekdays, it can be busy.   I've become accustomed to ordering the skillet cornbread as an appetizer. It is buttery with a kick and the top is sweet and crunchy. Together, this makes it for one of the best cornbreads you'll ever have. My go-to-dish is the meatloaf which is filled with a juicy mushroom flavor and goes perfect with their garlic mashed potatoes. The enchiladas are worth a try as well and my husband most recently enjoyed the prime rib.   They have a descent selection of beers with a few on draft. Lots of good wine to choose from and even some signature drinks such as the Caipirinha filled with cachaca, sugar cane, and lime. Although having too many of these can become pricey rather fast, definitely worth a try. This was similar to a mojito, but better in my opinion.   Finally, they currently offer an Oreo cookie sandwich dessert. The chocolate cookie was interesting- not identical to an Oreo, but similar. The ice cream was homemade and the entire thing sat in a warm bed of espresso sauce with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  2/9/06  Hmm.....  the portions seems a little smaller, the prices seemed a little higher, and the chicken was not as juicy as I remembered.  Maybe it was an off night?  I hope so.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   The most underrate meal in Phoenix!  I love Bandera.  It can get crowded during peak hours, but never outrageous.  I have eaten here many many times and I have never had a bad time.  The rotisserie chicken is the best I have had anywhere.  The smoked salmon appetizer is excellent.  The margaritas are fantastic.  Dark, stylish, comfortable booths, efficient and friendly service, and totally reasonable prices.  Yes, it is part of the Houston's chain.  But you know what?  They got the formula right here."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the bar during a business trip to Phoenix.  Clearly a popular place and for good reason.  The service at the bar was very friendly, professional and provided me with good recommendations for wine and food.  If you're hungry, I recommend the rib eye. It was presented sliced in nice, thick pieces...slightly sweet, smokey glaze and was a perfect pair with a nice full bodied red wine.  There are a heap of places in the \"Old Town\" area of Scottsdale.  I think Bandera is worth a visit.  My 2 cents. Greg T."}
{"text":"Their cornbread skillet is a great sharing starter, as is the Dip Duo (one is guacamole and the other is, I think, a seafood with zesty sauce).  It is a nice restaurant, with a dark wood decor.  Staff is friendly and they have a centralized bar.  I think it may be tough to have a large group meal here, unless you split up, because most of their tables are booths.  There is no patio seating, so you will be in dining in the dimly lit restaurant.    I had their Macho Salad: delicious and large!  The tomatoes and avocado slices were very large, and the chunks of goat cheese (which is soft and tasty) adds a nice flavor to the vegetable mix."}
